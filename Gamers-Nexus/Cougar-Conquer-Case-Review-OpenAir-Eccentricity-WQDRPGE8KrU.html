we're now looking at the Cougar conquer
there it is what you see is what you get
with this one it kind of takes some
pages from the core series core p3 core
v5 from Thermaltake in that it is
effectively an open-air case you are one
step away from being a test bench at
this point and that step is rotating it
and maybe removing the glass so this is
the Conqueror it's a $300 case we did
the usual thermals and noise although
noise is obviously not really a big
point of this and went through the whole
assembly process because it's basically
build it yourself once you buy it and
all that stuff so we're gonna review
this today and see how it does on the
bench versus everything else that's 300
ish dollars before getting to those that
this coverage is brought to you by EVGA
and their 10 ATT is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full SC 2 review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080i
SC 2 so this case is obviously not
really something that you're buying for
value so we can just kind of strike that
immediately we're not reviewing this for
value today subjectively you're going
for looks
that's up to you what I can tell you
about is the build quality the assembly
thermals and noise so build quality it's
all pretty thick paneling so they have 4
or 5 millimeter thick tempered glass for
each side and then aluminum bars that
jut out from a central aluminum frame
and the assembly is all done when you
get it so it does not shift built so
you're you screw together the bars these
feet provide a wide base to provide some
stability but ultimately you actually
need this glass panel on for complete
structural stability up until that point
it does kind of wobble and flex a little
bit and it's pretty easy to knock it
over however once you have the glass
panels on there is no knocking over
issues whatsoever this thing's not going
to move at this point it's moving the
table more than anything else so that's
kind of its kind of what you get once
you buy it
just be aware that you're basically
building it it's not difficult to
assemble it's really not that much
different from the core p3 or p5 except
in the visuals and obviously they speak
for themselves now in terms of other
things on here it's got pretty easy
access to everything so you just remove
a couple screws and you can push the
entire front panel up like that just
hinge it like a helmet or something then
at that point you get access to three
120 days
koogler technically recommends in their
manual that you install one fan up here
as intake and then two in the front as
intake we did testing with that versus
all three in the top intake will have
numbers three in a moment but the thing
to keep in mind with a case like this is
because it's basically open air and
there's holes all over the place for the
air to escape the closer the fan is to
the target the destination the better
and the way it's set up now is basically
with two intake fans that air is
dispersing across the case before it
ever really gets the components with any
meaningful pressure left to the airflow
putting a fan at the top here you're
forcing air straight into the CPU cooler
so that's obviously gonna work a lot
better so that's what you need to keep
in mind thermally in terms of the
assembly process and the build quality
the aluminum is about three millimeters
thick in most locations and typically
you would use that as a bragging point
to say we damped the lower frequency
noises pretty well but obviously that's
irrelevant here and the assembly process
has you putting the power supply in the
front so it's mounted in the front
bottom which is sort of interesting for
a few reasons
one of them is that because we're in
taking from the bottom and the power
supply is exhausting towards me right
now it's pushing that hot air straight
into the GPU however
couger actually did something here that
is pretty clever they just have a simple
shield basically that redirects the air
down to a point where it's not really
causing any trouble at all so that's
good they've done well there to think
that through and not caused problems the
rest of the enclosure has you routing
cables kind of through the
left around the back and it's a little
bit troublesome with the 8 pin or the
EPS 12-volt cables we're actually using
an extender here because our cable for
the power supply wasn't long enough
stock so something to keep in mind and
that may be true for some of the other
cables as well that's just the nature of
having a power supply mounted in front
and then kind of hiding your power cable
to the wall and all that stuff the sort
of elephant in the room with this case
though is raid backs probably never
thought anyone would say that raid max
has come back from the dead or wherever
they were and they have a case that's
really similar to this in fact it has
almost identical if not identical
tempered glass side panels that have
just been installed in a different way
they're basically flipped the other way
around
and the feet for the case are almost
identical if not identical that case is
called the raid max x08 theoretically it
has a lower price point than this one
which is 300 to 350 2-pound where you
look the raid max case is pretty hard to
find but also we spoke to cougar about
this and if you kind of look at Cougars
Twitter feed they've been a little bit I
believe the internet comments ours would
say salty lately but really it's just
kind of tongue in cheek or or really
frustrated or pissed off sarcasm would
be how I would describe it where they've
had tweets replying to raid Maddox
basically saying ours is the original
design so we talked some about this
because it's not uncommon in fact it's
actually very common for case
manufacturers to use the same tooling
between them rebrand it change some
colors change some fans and sell it for
roughly the same price that we've seen
with the the Silverstone cases that we
talked about recently the old red line
zero five we've seen that with the char
Coon ones that came out afterward with
the antec case there's about six cases
that use that same cooling this however
is different so we talked to cougar
about it and they alleged that the
original patent and they sent me the the
Chinese original patent text is assigned
to cougar so apparently this design
according to them is patented
by their company and it's supposed to be
made exclusively by them or their parent
company more appropriately so we also
asked if the same supplier is making the
rate max cases and didn't really get a
firm answer yet
but they're working on an official legal
statement for us that we can share and
we'll see what's going on but basically
it sounds like cougar is alleging that
raid max is basically a knockoff my word
not theirs so that's what I'm taking
away right now it's hard to say if
that's accurate or if they're just using
the same supplier I'm not in a position
to answer that we haven't been able to
talk to max about this yet so take it
for what it's worth but basically there
are two versions of the same case is
what you can take away from it and one
is cheaper but it looks a bit different
so with that said let's talk through
some of Patrick's billed notes here and
his thoughts on the case during the
build process you can find his written
review linked below and then we'll get
into thermals and noise after that
starting off the conquer is a huge case
it's easy to underestimate its size and
pictures because of its unusual shape
but it's large enough to easily fit a
full ATX board at a diagonal angle
making it both taller and wider than
standard cases the vast majority of the
chassis is constructed from three to
five millimeter thick aluminum and glass
on all sides making it much heavier than
the skeletal frame implies it's
technically an open-air chassis but with
a case like frame providing mounting
points for several fans the cases
appearance is a large part of what will
make users love or hate it the price
being the second one the translucent
orange fans included with our review
sample we're lit by red LED is not the
most pleasant combination but otherwise
looked fine if you consider that color
to be good with your build the Cougar
concur does fit in visually with the
rest of Cougars product line but it also
bears a close resemblance to the raid
max again X is zero eight this is
something to keep in mind if you want to
find alternatives however again it's a
matter of whether that case is available
and also whether it remains available
depending on pending legal discourse
building the case is straightforward if
the instructions are followed and no
parts are missing Construction is solid
the body feels a little wobbly during
installation without the
added support from the glass and the
balancing beams but once they're in
place the case can be safely picked up
and moved by pretty much any point
except for the power supply and the PCIe
brackets the brackets do their job just
fine but they aren't heavily reinforced
as the rest of the case is the glass
side feels somewhat token given that the
case is basically open to the elements
but they must be installed for the case
to be fully stable good looking cable
management is a real nightmare in this
case because of the dual sided glass
panels but there are plenty of cutouts
available for strapping cables too and
that helps make it a little bit easier
but you're still gonna have to put in
some effort to make it all tidy the
power supply is mounted towards the
front of the case so cables need to
stretch a little farther than usual
especially again the eight pin connector
going on to thermals and noise the
conquerer would probably still be usable
even if it didn't include any fans at
all it would rank around where the
Thermaltake core p3 falls but it does
include three fans we installed them
according to the manual which shows two
intake fans at the front of the case and
one intake at the top pointing down
towards the CPU cooler we wouldn't
always choose top and take primarily for
dust reasons but the angle of the
motherboard means that it's the most
practical way to push air into our CPU
heatsink otherwise you're just fighting
each other for air for additional
testing we put all three stock fans the
top intake slots since the two intake
fans are fairly far away from the actual
system and possibly limited in their
effectiveness as the air will again just
sort of diffuse across the entire
chassis and find the nearest exit the
active cooling and big open holes
combined with the lack of filters makes
the conger potentially dusty more so
than the passively cooled open-air cases
like the thermal take Corp III but just
make sure you do preventative
maintenance focusing first on the stock
cooler conquer configuration versus our
top three intake setup CPU temperature
is forty eight point five degrees
Celsius over ambient when under a
torture workload and forty-two point
four degrees with all the fans in the
top four intake blowing down to the CPU
cooler the top intake position is in a
great spot to help the CPU temperatures
and the more fans the better in this
configuration the stock top intake fan
is placed directly below the cutout in
the top panel of the cooler case
removing any barriers
floo comparing against other cases 48
point five degrees Celsius is a lower CB
temperature than any other stock case
we've tested except for the Silverstone
RL zero six and forty-two point four
degrees is lower than anything on the
chart altogether the concur has the
cooling advantage of the Corp III being
that it's open-air and you can't get
better than that really anything else is
just a box that insulates it but it
doesn't rely solely on passive cooling
to pump the heat out of the case
although it could our l06 maintains its
lead because of the huge volume of air
pumped in a straight line through the
case and is only outperformed when three
fans are positioned inches from the CPU
intake most other cases we've tested try
to balance air flow with noise
suppression or visual style and these
two are clearly outliers from that norm
GPU temperature is fifty point nine
degrees Celsius in the stock
configuration with fifty three point two
degrees measured for all fans at the top
of the case the top intake fans are
exclusively over the backplate while
these stock configuration with two
intake fans in the front direct air
directly into the GPU cooler the
distance from the front of the case to
the GPU lessens they're affecting this
somewhat but the temperature reduction
is measurable one subtle but important
feature of the conquer is that although
the PSU is mounted at the bottom of the
case with no shroud and angled aluminum
metal shield directs exhaust downwards
and away from the GPU fans comparatively
fifty point nine degrees Celsius is an
unusually low GPU temperature among the
best on our chart even unlike the CPU
temperatures this has relatively little
to do with active cooling even without
the benefit of fans directed into the
cooler fifty three point two degrees is
still a respectable score here the
biggest contributor to GPU cooling is
the fact that the case has no bottom to
block out cool air no a shroud to block
access to air for an open-face card
those side panels to keep the air
trapped in and that there's no sealed
top again that would keep the air
trapped in struggling to get out fast
enough the GPUs heat is able to
naturally find pathways out of the case
keeping it cool over long up times the
3d mark firestrike extreme test lasts
longer than our torture test and
typically results in higher average GPU
temperature the conquer managed fifty
three point six degrees Celsius
just slightly better than the previous
champion the view 71 TG we haven't
tested every case with fire strike but
it's safe to say that the Congress
Tinley allows good GPU cooling that's
what you get with open air with blender
next and with the CPU render benchmark
we saw thirty six point one degrees
Celsius delta T over a mint for the
Cougar conquer which supplied better CPU
cooling than most of the other cases
tested but the RL zero six does keep the
crown for now rendering on the GPU
average the GPU temperature of twenty
four point six degrees it barely beat
the RL zero six here making it the new
leader both of these scores are
extremely good but the Concord is still
impractical for business use because of
the lack of hard drive space
the lack of filtration not to mention
the size the price and the look it could
also be impractical for pet owners or
those of you with children for streamers
youtubers anyone who's an enthusiast and
doesn't have the risk of external
sources messing with your exposed
components it would be a good case for
showroom or production use if you're
trying to make the most of what you have
in terms of visuals and showing off as
expected with noise the Conqueror is a
noisy case with three 120 millimeter
fans at full speed and with nothing to
silence number block the noise thirty
nine point eight decibels is similar to
the Coolermaster H five hundred P and
scores between other well ventilated
cases that like the Fraxel metruff IC
and the third will take me to 71 given
the cooling performance overall though
there's no reason to run the fans at
full speed or even install all three
fans you could run without them and then
your noise level would be system noise
so it's a pretty good case overall in
terms of thermals and things like that
noise maybe not so much but again when
your temperature performance is as good
as this is you don't even need the fans
real you run them at a lower rpm and
you'll be about where the other cases
are with similar or better noise levels
depending on what you're using so it
doesn't really come down to thermals and
noise it comes down to price and what it
is this is going to be a highly
polarizing design you either love it or
you hate it based on the visuals and
then the price at three hundred to three
hundred fifty dollars from both
retailers does immediately price out a
lot of the market this is a showroom
case it's similar and competes most
directly with a company like in wind
freeze
Appl the other competition would be
something like the dark Bass Pro 900 200
to 250 dollars it's more practical it's
a bit more traditional and it's format
but still has some flashy elements to it
you could also look at something like
the thermaltake view 71 it's got all the
tempered glass so it has some Flair and
it's a lot cheaper but neither of them
really look quite like this so this is
pretty unique and there's not a lot you
can find other than the clone raid
mattes exhale wait that would provide a
similar look so if you if it's the look
you want really there's nothing that I
should or could say that would sway you
otherwise because there's no other
options but if you're just looking for
an expensive good case again we'd
recommend considering this one versus
some of the in one cases they have a lot
of them that are in this price bracket
you could look at the dark base pro 900
you can look at the view 71 if you want
an open-air case that's really cheap and
can be used as sort of a semi test bench
or wall mountable machine the core
series from Thermaltake is very good and
much cheaper but again they don't look
quite the same
that said the core p3 core p5 would be
great options if you really just want
something accessible that's still
vertically mounting your computer so
overall performance is great but that's
not the point and you're also not
competing with something like the
redline 0 6 which offers similar
performance if not better in some cases
and it's 75 dollars it's just not even
the same category of competition
different divisions altogether so the
conquer is certainly no bargain but it's
a unique look
that's up to you whether you like it or
not and the raid Maxx xo8 depending on
how you feel about their current pending
legal dispute between couger and raid
max that might be a cheaper option as
well but that's we'll see how that goes
