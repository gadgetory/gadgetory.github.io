dotnet and right now we're talking about
The Witcher 3 again and this is because
CD Projekt RED recently posted a
financial briefing detailing the game's
success through the first half of 2015
this is pretty relevant and interesting
industry news if you're interested into
the finances of the games and hardware
industries in terms of sales figures The
Witcher 3 shipped 1 million downloads
through the GOG galaxy service and GOG
is a sister company to CD Projekt RED
both owned by CEO Adam Kachinsky who is
the one that presented these sales data
were reporting on here today the game
also sold a total of 6 million copies
through all downloadable and physically
purchase of all forms including consoles
and PC and its profit was posted at a
net of sixty two point five million
dollars a pretty big growth considering
the company posted and this is not Mima
speaking a one thousand dollar profit
last year so the difference for this is
because there was in fairness a four
year stagnation from the time that the
witcher 2 released which was in 2011 and
the time the witcher 3 released which
was earlier this year that burned down
is what leads into the next game
launching so that shows CD Projekt RED
was capable of doing their numbers
correctly
hopefully it was not a coincidence and
it also shows that the company is
quoting the CEO very experienced at what
they do or at least that's what he says
in his financial briefings the reason
that CEO Adam Kachinsky claims that his
team is the best at what they do is
because in his words RPGs are among the
hardest genre or hardest type of game to
make and he believes that because of
this and because there are few game
companies that can make RPGs his team is
among the best in the industry Kachinsky
also stated that the team doesn't jump
around from one genre to the next they
stay with RPGs and he claims that this
is their big contribution to why the
Witcher games have steadily improved
over the past few years The Witcher 3 is
a budget was 81 million dollars so it's
expensed
81 million and the profit was sixty-two
point five million the put things into
perspective The Witcher 2 had a budget
that was so measly in comparison just
ten point three million dollars which is
really pretty cheap to make a game these
days and to put that into perspective we
can look at GTA 5 which also launched
this year and was extremely successful
on the PC obviously came out a bit
earlier on other platforms that had a
budget of 265 million dollars with
destiny shadowing it at 500 million
dollars including the marketing budget
and in terms of other games another
major title would be star citizen at
around 90 million but that's not out yet
and it's also a crowdfunded title so a
bit different but that puts things into
perspective for The Witcher 3 with its
81 million dollar budget a large growth
over the 10 point three million dollars
of The Witcher 2 in terms of other sales
figures that are of interest the
physical box sales of The Witcher 3 were
marked at 27 point two million dollars
with the digital download and channel
distribution sales at 73 million making
a total of a little over a hundred or so
today on how you add up the decimals
there and that's all for this which are
three brief news catch up for those of
you who haven't been following the game
as closely since its launch and be sure

news including the AMD CPU and APU
lineup that we just posted on the
