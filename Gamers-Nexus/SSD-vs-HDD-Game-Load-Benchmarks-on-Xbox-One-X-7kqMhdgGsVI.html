solid-state drives for quite a while we
know what it's like to go to an SSD from
a harddrive it's nearly a requirement in
a modern build a side from the cheapest
of the cheap our brethren over in the
console camp sadly don't know what it's
like they have to go buy a separate
solid-state drive throw it into an
enclosure or
open the thing up and install it and
it's just it's it makes me so sad that I
nearly want to open a charity to
distribute SSDs for them but what we're
gonna do instead is test the boot times
and other game launch and load times
between an SSD externally and an
internal hard drive because that alone
is massive we're not even talking about
opening the thing this is something so
simple that anyone pretty much could do
it before that this video is brought to
you by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor hot liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydronaut pastes learn more at the link
below so we looked into the option of
doing an internal replacement it
wouldn't be hard we've obviously opened
the thing before I mean there's a
thermocouple sticking out of it doesn't
come like that so it's not too difficult
to open it we have a whole video on
opening the Xbox one X and the theta is
that you do have to do some work with
cloning the drive because Microsoft does
not officially support an internal drive
replacement in fact they still have some
types of copy protection on it that make
it a little bit annoying to properly
clone the drives Sony has done a great
job of it from what we understand Sony's
is basically a flap in the bottom of the
console that anyone can open up and
replace the drive and it basically goes
so if you've got a Playstation you're in
good shape already but we decided to
simplify it and just do an external
drive we picked up a crucial MX 500's SD
for this they're relatively cheap this
is a 500 gigabyte drive through a bunch
of games on it and let it go so the one
terabyte drive that's in here is a
Seagate model drive it's an ST 1000 lm0
3/5 which is absolutely
positively a 5400 rpm drive some reason
people argued with that when we first
open the thing even though the data
sheets say 5400 rpm so no it is not 7200
and even with the datasheet suggesting a
140 megabyte per second peak transfer
rate we're talking a hard drive here
it's a physical spinning disk it has to
seek to find the data and Burstyn speeds
are not the same as sustained speeds and
even more important hard drives are
particularly bad at random operations 4k
IOPS things like that so that's where
nasa's d excels and either way the hard
drive internally is not bottlenecking on
the SATA 3 interface that the Xbox uses
and this is where I want to talk to the
console users who may not know who we
are for a moment everyone else in the PC
audience I'm sure you know the
difference between the rated speed of an
interface and the speed of a device for
a console if you've got a SATA 3
interface in there that does 6 gigabits
per second but your hard drive does a
lot less than that
it doesn't really matter in fact we can
use this USB 3.0 4.8 gigabit per second
cable which is obviously lower than 6
and still get faster speeds and that's
just because we're limited by the speed
of the device in the case of the hard
drive not the speed of the interface so
I know that's super basic stuff for a
lot of you but we might be talking to a
slightly different audience here so I
wanted to put that out there let's get
into the benchmarks for this we tested
five games which is a mix of titles that
we've already benchmarked with our
in-house benchmark utility framerate
measurement utility for Xbox and we also
included one game that we might test in
the future launch times were measured
from the time that the game was selected
to the first on-screen prompt that would
be like press a to start for example and
we have more details in the test
methodology section and the article
links in the description below if you
want to know precisely when we started
and stopped our measurement procedure
some variants can be expected depending
on how long server connections take for
multiplayer games and tests to test
variants for monster hunter and pub G
was a bit higher in this
the others on the other hand destiny
two's launch times were extremely
reliable and the SSD shaved off nearly
nineteen two seconds or a 33.7%
reduction four of the games we test it
had save files that could be loaded and
all of them benefited from an SSD for
the destiny to campaign test we used a
character that had partly completed the
first mission of the campaign so that
they would load directly into gameplay
for the farm test we timed launching
into the farm hub level from orbit Final
Fantasy 15 has the most gain from an SSD
with a load time reduction of sixty six
point five percent that saves at forty
four seconds not counting the time saved
from launching the game Final Fantasy 15
load times are notoriously bad and this
doesn't bode well for PC players that
don't have 100 plus gigabytes to spare
on their SSDs when that comes out later
anyway pub G doesn't have a save file to
load but it does have something we've
complained about in the past obnoxiously
slow texture pop-in the easiest place to
measure this is in the main menu
but our avatar is at three second
transformation from the hot dog man to
fully textured human wasn't improved
enough to be reliably measured it was
reliably bad though the time from the
end of the previous test periods of the
final texture path called
menu load in the chart was reduced by a
few seconds but most of the time saving
happens before the character appears on
screen
we considered testing texture load times
in game but it's hard to create a
reproducible test although this was a
large part of why we wanted to try and
SSD in the first place the bottom line
is that an SSD won't solve the popin
problems with pub G and it's still
noticeably bad there are three Monster
Hunter x logs in the chart as well due
to the nature of the game the first is
just regular load time or how long it
took us to load from the main menu to
the hub level Capcom's that servers were
helpfully busted during testing so we
were able to play offline only the
multiplayer was just not functional the
next period is the preparation phase of
a quest and this would normally be when
matchmaking happens and party members
join but it took a good 30 seconds when
choosing a single-player quest an
offline mode so some kind of loading is
still happening here this
a lot of variants run to run the final
period is between departing on the quest
and actually appearing in the new level
of the three the initial load time was
the most reliable and with an SSD it was
reduced by thirty three point eight
percent over hard drive load time using
an external SSD with the Xbox one X then
is pretty useful and actually worthwhile
because we're seeing massive reductions
in some of these games GTA 5 would
probably be about equivalent to Final
Fantasy 15 with Final Fantasy 15 we're
talking like 40 seconds for the load
screen that was tested every time you
load something or fast travel or
whatever every loading screen if you're
saving 34 percent of your time to 65
percent of your time in the case of
Final Fantasy that's a lot of time forty
seconds for every the hood screen adds
up it's not about like getting minutes
of your life back that's kind of
overdoing it a bit it's more about just
how frustrating it is to sit there
staring at a loading screen for 70
seconds that's abnormally long in this
day and age so we would say it's worth
doing an external drive obviously the
ideal thing to do would be replace it
with an internal 1 terabyte SSD or
something like that it's not too
difficult opening the console is easy
replacing it at a hardware level is easy
we have videos that show how you would
open it up the more kinda difficult part
is cloning of the drive and getting
around copy protection I fix it has a
good guide and a script you can run that
will do most of that for you if you want
to go that route I fix it does have a
solution and the one thing here that we
wanted to point out is that Microsoft
has made it pretty hard to replace the
drive and it'll look interesting oh
pretty bad think on them if they release
a SKU with an SSD in the future it seems
like they kind of left the door open for
that but with flash prices the way they
are that might not have it it might make
more sense to just wait for the next
generation console so either way pretty
pretty straightforward content SSDs are
good welcome to the future console
players hopefully the the next
generation actually has SSDs because I
know it seriously it's it's a major
difference even if they just did some
kind of cache drive solution like an
optical
and that would be a big deal for the
future and it would be cheaper than an
SSD so we'll see these were in
development for a long time before the
new cash Drive started coming out so
anyway that's the that's the content for
this one subscribe for more you can
check our xbox benchmarks on the channel
if you're interested or all the PC stuff
obviously go to patreon.com/scishow
Nexus tops out directly or store it out
gamers Nexus dotnet to pick up a shirt
like this one or one of our sweet
stickers that we stuck on the Xbox and
it hasn't even melted off yet so it's
actually it's pretty good a test case
thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time
actions take four multiplayer games and
test the test variants for Monterey
Monterey Monterey Hunter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
