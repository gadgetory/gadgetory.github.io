stn this one we're shooting in the old
studio just for the intro though because
i'm joined by senior am the analyst
snowflake
that was impressive snowflake I thought
you'd bail on me and if you're new here
I just wanted to give you a look at
where we came from just recently the
last couple of months actually I know a
lot of you were new from the Walmart
video and other videos but if you've
been a longtime GN viewer of course give
it up for a snowflake in the comments
below if you have questions for next
week's asked well hopefully next week's
ask GN episode leave them in the comment
section below and I'll do my best to get
to your questions for technical
questions for the next acts GN and if
you're new here this is a Q&amp;amp;A segment
where we take your questions whether
here or on patreon you go to
patreon.com/scishow gamers next to leave
a question there in the discord and we
try to answer them to the best of our
abilities and this is senior AMD analyst
snowflake before that this video is
brought to you by ether all take score
p3 case the core p3 is one of the most
unique cases on the market it can serve
as an open-air standing chassis a test
bench in vertical or horizontal
orientation or as a wall-mounted
showcase PC the core p3 now comes with a
5 millimeter thick tempered glass panel
for its slide but keeps the front top
and back open for air the core p3
versatility as a display piece test
bench or standard desktop is reinforced
by its price of roughly 110 dollars on
Amazon you can learn more at the link in
the description below so before we
transport teleport over to the proper
set the real set the new set these days
this is what happens the old ones elude
while still here you know the iconic
wood wall there it is it's still around
and I've mounted some bike frames to the
wall for the side channel the GMCs
GN steve side channel choice does that
we'll be doing some more videos on that
channel on this set at some point not
sure exactly when but that's what's been
going on here if you've been wandering
it's been a lot of work but let's
teleport over to the main set now where
the audio is better and also everything
else including the lighting
all right so this isn't ask GN a lot of
you already know the rules if you have a
question as I said earlier post it in
the comment section below or if you have
access to our patreon only discord you
can go to patreon.com/scishow cameras
Nexus you can also post your questions
in the ask GM channel it's been a little
while since we've done one of these so
we might end up doing two for this
weekend but let's just start with the
one and see how it goes first question
is from Sauron and Sauron said so I just
watched dare Bauer's video where he
talks about the 9900 K stim issues and
he sanded down the dot I was under the
impression that the dye was the
processor and all the transistors were
in there but if it's okay to send it
down then what really is the dye and
where are the transistors located the
PCB under the dye that makes me think
again what the dye really is and what
its function is this is a great question
and fortunately most of those are pretty
easy to answer at at least a service
level so the most immediate answer I'll
give you what is the dye well the dye is
a much it's a smaller piece of silicon
underneath that shiny layer that shiny
layer is a diffusion barrier and I'll go
over some more of that in a second with
some notes from there Bauer as well the
one you referenced and so under that
diffusion barrier you eventually have
the actual silicon die depend on which
processor it is sometimes that's facing
down towards the substrate sometimes
it's facing up it depends on which one
you're working with but the you call it
let's see you said the PCB under the die
so the that PCB that's a commonly called
a substrate and that's just an inter
connecting grid of traces to connect all
the everything together on the CPU
proper but the dye itself is a smaller
piece of silicon that sits under the
diffusion barrier so what is that
diffusion barrier well this one eyes to
do some research on myself and I knew
the basics of it already because I've
also seen that video and I spoke with
Roman a bit in the past about this so I
have Rowan being their power so I have
some of his input as well alongside
quotes from an old article of his
written in 2015 that's to this day still
accurate so let's go through my notes
first then we'll go through his
is written version so the the shiny
layer is made of silicon nitride and it
is a barrier that has worse thermal
conductivity than just straight silicon
the problem is exposing just straight
silicon to really anything else can
potentially cause corruption of the
silicon you could end up with issues
later on from materials diffusing into
the silicon so there's a barrier there
at diffusion barrier silicon quoting
their Bower is about 150 watts per meter
Kelvin thermal conductivity which is
pretty damn high not it's a bit below
aluminum give you some perspective
silicon nitride again quoting their
Bower depending on the application is
between 30 and 100 watts per meter
Kelvin that's a massive range but it
really depends on the thickness of the
material how they're using it what type
of silicon nitride they're using but
that's your range some atoms of liquid
metal in his example could diffuse into
the dye if you sand down the surface so
there's some risk there inherently
withstanding down the dye aside from the
existing risk that you might sand a bit
too far and when you're dealing with
literally billions of transistors under
that shiny layer at some point you go a
little to the even one part but not the
other you could kill something and and
that that something may very well be the
entire CPU so you have to be careful he
ever do that kind of deal it in
extremely liddie and wouldn't really
recommend it we've done it but i
wouldn't recommend it but anyway any
kind of diffuse isn't diffusion into the
silicon over time could damage it so as
Roman said in his video one of the
concerns with doing I sanded down die or
sanding off that diffusion barrier is
that over time whatever interface you
put on top of the then sand it down dye
could cause damage to the dye itself
because you no longer have that
protective barrier between it so on his
79 80 XE he removed between 30 and 80
micrometer zuv microns of silicon and 80
at the center so that was the deepest
part now a die especially in tiles they
tend to be they are not level all the
way across he'll get kind of a concave
IHS but that's not the same as the dye
itself the dye itself
have differing heights in the corners
and the center as he showed the center
is a bit higher on the die on that
diffusion barrier and the one he was
working on so silicon nitride layers are
used to protect the dye underneath they
are particularly good against things
like corrosion interference caused by
ions or other chemicals that you don't
want interacting with the silicon you
also use diffusion barriers between the
thermal paste and the silicon die or in
this his case liquid metal and thrown
paste is topped by nickel-plated copper
which is another material more chemicals
that could end up plating or something
like that so let me read what what Roman
said to give you a a well researched
answer as well
so Roman in an old article he wrote in
2015
said quote nickel will act as a
diffusion barrier to prevent any atoms
to form an alloy with the copper indium
also sticks to nickel but not really
well so to improve the adhesion you have
to apply another layer on top preferably
using a noble metal because they provide
some of the best wedding conditions
examples would be gold silver or
palladium and the melting point of
silver and gold is quite similar at
around 1,000 degrees Celsius melting
point of palladium is at 1555 Celsius
which makes it much harder to apply on
the heat spreader so choosing between
gold and silver gold easily forms an
alloy with indium and has great wedding
conditions before you can think of
soldering you have to apply a gold layer
on the heat spreader the gold layer has
to be around 1 to 3 microns thick the
diet is made out of silicon si but you
can't solder directly to silicon this is
another reason that the viewing barriers
there otherwise indium would diffuse
into the silicon which would result in a
different doping characteristic or
damage the chip over time so you need
another diffusion barrier on top of the
CPU the diffusion barrier is formed out
of several layers made of titanium
nickel and vanadium on top of the
diffusion barrier you need another gold
layer as wetting layer for the indium
connection so if you want to read more
about this that's kind of the whole
section he had on your exact question
but if you want to read more it's an old
I think it's an overclocking guy
is overclocking that guide as a site you
can find it there or of course you can
go if you don't know who he is to dare
bowers channel we would highly recommend
it because he's a great source for
extreme overclocking and other material
property information so hopefully that
helps you out with the question I want
to went ahead and quoted his response
for the most detail that we could get on
short notice although I have spoken with
him about this question in the past so
next one this turn was from sad panda so
sad panda asks asked a question on your
last live stream and you gave a quick
thought but wondering a little more i'm
overclocking a non ki v 6400 at 4.7
gigahertz 1.3 to 5 volt so i have to
disable c states turbo boost
full for a full time overclock three
days power usage and heat I've been
using level 8 LLC to ramp up voltage
under load and drop back down to one
point two eight zero at idle this seems
like it has the effect I'm looking for
but I'm worried that max LLC that's load
line calibration you don't know maybe
spiking higher than what is reported in
hardware info is this something I should
worry about and test with a no scope
order the spikes normally report
accurately as max B core in hardware
info another good question so for this
one it depends on the motherboard a lot
typically hardware info at least these
days this is a bit of an older CPU
you're talking about but on a lot of the
modern products we work with Hardware
infos pretty damn accurate there is
still some variance and we spoke with
asus recently about this so what I have
here is a great discussion topic from
from your question but we spoke with a
C's about this previously so the chart
we're going to put on this tribute to
the screen is from John Sandstrom aka
Elmore you may know him from
overclocking forums Elmore worked at
Asus just up until recently and really
didn't get enough credit for the
engineering work he's contributed to a
Seuss's products BIOS things like that
I'm sure he got credit internally but
externally wasn't wasn't wasn't that
famous as he deserved to be or maybe it
was too famous depending on if you're
talking to him or not
either way Elmore got hounded constantly
by the community for
questions I got hounded constantly by
press with questions and one of the
things he did was provide us with an
example right before he left but the the
level of detail he'd go into so tested
at 5 gigahertz on one point three volts
with a 9900 ki1 found the table on the
screen now for the Maximus 11 hero and
Maximus 10 hero and this is a quote from
him he said as you can see M 11 hero
should be at most 10 to 15 millivolts
off on the on-die sense measurement and
is primarily due to the SI o ADC
granularity and error characteristics
the Maximus 10 hero is using a simpler
voltage sense circuit and is in this
case up over 100 millivolts off under
heavy load you should see similar values
if you measure on other boards he
continued saying there are no on-die
sensors there's only on Dai sense what
this means is that there are two pins on
the CPU for measuring the quote actual
voltage reaching the IC without any
current bias on the Maximus 11 we've
added a circuit for feeding this
differential signal into the super i/o
ADC or analog to digital converter BIOS
cpu-z and hardware info will all read
this value from the s io and Elmer also
sent us some photos we can put up on the
screen of measurement points for a V
core andand I sense for those tomb other
words the max was 10 and 11 so to really
get into your answer then it is possible
that a high load line calibration can
overshoot and you might spike up instead
of down like with a more conservative
LLC we have video on the channel by bill
joy where he explains how LLC works I
think it's probably called how load line
calibration works search it on our
channel and that should help answer your
question in greater depth but to really
give you a straight answer here
hardware info cpz things like that are
not always accurate
it varies board to board we've found
that they are pretty accurate with ninth
gen gen and with the Maximus 11 hero and
that's helpful for figuring out if
you're getting the voltage you think
you're getting now you the best way if
you really want them to be careful to
measure this you could take a DMM you
stand the board up maybe it's
case and you have good access to the
back you stand the board up somehow and
you when it's off you find the
capacitors in the socket the CPU socket
backside that correspond to V core you
can
I mean his photo really helps a lot with
making that easier but if you don't know
where they are you don't have those
boards what you do is you probe like a
leg on a choke or a MOSFET from the V
Corps v RM and then you probe all the
different capacitors on the back of the
CPU socket until you find one that is
continuous so you're doing the
resistance probe and once you find the
one that's well one of the ones that
goes to V core you can measure both
sides of the cap this is dangerous
so be careful the reason it's dangerous
it's not not like physically going to
harm you but it's dangerous probably but
just to cover myself there almost
certainly not going to there's really no
there's there's no meaningful amount of
of current going through there that's
going to hurt you but the only reason
it's dangerous is because you can kill
the component and that's because you're
working with a really small capacitor
and so if you slip when you're probing
and you bridge two caps or a cap and
something else then they can obviously
arc to one another and that might very
well kill the motherboard so that's the
only reason there's any danger to doing
that if you feel really uncomfortable
probing two sides of the same tiny cap
there's the best way to get an accurate
measurement for your actual voltage then
what you can do you could either solder
small wires to it kind of like Eleanor
did don't really want to do that though
so perhaps easier would be probe one
side of the cap and then stick the
ground into a molex cable you're gonna
have variants here so we've measured it
between 20 and 50 millivolts and that'll
throw off your numbers but it's kind of
close enough where you'll be in the
ballpark and figure out if you're you're
within safety for your voltage and that
would that will vary based on the length
of the molex cable and stuff like the
vary on the power supply to basically
you want the ground that's closest to
that capacitor as possible and the
closest is grounded on the capacitor is
going to be the one literally on the
capacitor but if you don't feel
comfortable doing that grab some other
ground nearby and a molex cables just
easy you can you can shove it into the
molex cable it's the probes like the
perfect
that pen and it's not gonna go anywhere
but um to answer your question though it
depends on the motherboard but typically
typically they are pretty accurate these
days just you know that's how you would
check if you're the one to be sure and
next what oh yeah and also check our
video from builds right in the past on
LLC if you want more information on that
next one so this is from banana milk it
says what makes some 100% CPU GPU loads
more intense than others Intel burn test
AVX workloads fuzzy donut etc fuzzy
Donuts the best one I can speak to you
because I know pretty well how it works
we use it all the time so the fuzzy
donut is a its fur mark and it's a great
GPU torture test it's known as a power
virus because in the past it was used to
literally kill GPUs by way of pulling
too much current or buy too much too
much current load on the MOSFETs
specifically so you'd have MOSFETs just
pop and I know pretty much all of our
core audience knows what this is at this
point we have a lot of new people from
the Walmart video so your MOSFETs are
right there next to the inductor line
those are the inductors it's capacitor
bank and the the old versions of Nvidia
AMD drivers ati drivers in the old
versions of fir mark you could very well
push too much power because it's a power
virus and blow up a a mosfet or some
other vrm component so that's been
changed in these days for mark if you
run it you'll notice the frequency is
actually significantly lower than base
and boost and that's why we always make
a note when we do those tasks with fir
mark that yeah it says 1500 megahertz
don't worry there's nothing wrong with
the card it's just that it's not gonna
run it 19 100 when it's been absolutely
tortured with something that's so
thermally constraining so anyway what
makes it thermally constrained there's a
few reasons for this let's talk about
the base of your question which is what
makes different loads more intense than
others a good example is times by
extremes gt2 graphics test - this is a
very memory intensive workload if you
veer M intensive specifically so if you
open up I don't know you could open up
gpu-z for example and you look at the
vram
request it's not necessarily what's
being used but it's pretty damn close so
look at V requested you'll see it's
fairly intensive and also if you
increase the memory clocks in that test
gt2 versus GT one you'll find that the
maximum stable overclock will be
different between them and that's
because in GT one you're really
straining the core and GT 2 you're
really straining the memory so if you
can boost the memory a bit higher in GT
2 your score will be affected in a
disproportionate way than if you boost
the core clock in GT 2 the difficulty is
that in GT 2 we've seen the vram
frequency is less likely to be stable so
you can more likely get away with
boosting the core frequency further it's
just that the payoff is less because the
workload is primarily on GT tip as on
vram and GT 2 and the reason that you
have these differences and we're ones
more memory intensive and one isn't is
really just the way the applications
program then what kind of work look what
kind of in this case textures you're
dealing with and assets and things like
that so to go further on this some CPU
loads might strain the memory controller
and core simultaneously which produces
additional heat on the CPU because now
you have multiple components active and
really doing work so you have more heat
in a smaller area an application like
fur mark is stressful because in part it
never stops loading the GPU and a lot of
gaming or real workloads there will be
contact switching that can give the
cores a moment's pause to cool down
where a moment is a very small period of
time with stress testers like fur mark
it's loading the GPU to 99% constantly
and as unrelenting you'll notice that
fur mark doesn't really load the memory
the command processors and the GPU never
really have to talk to the CPU via PCIe
for the most part in a real gaming or
workstation application your CPU is
going to be constantly shoving textures
and assets from storage into the GPUs
command processor remember everything
except for DMA everything pretty much
has to go through the CPU at some point
so it's shoving stuff into the command
processor the GPUs command processor
then shoves that data into its video
memory and switching assets and changing
the type of rendering workload like for
example switching between geometry
processing and texture filtering and
streaming or copies
transcodes and encodes rather decodes
that will give small periods of time
where some of those lanes on the vector
aren't really doing anything that lanes
on the vector here would be CUDA cores
stream processors things like that so
GPU utilization is measured in multiple
parts one hundred percent utilization
could mean that you're copying on copies
you're 100 percent utilized on
everything that handles copying or maybe
100 percent utilized on everything that
handles video encode and decode or
compute or maybe the graphics that the
singular graphics thread in a game scene
one hard percent utilization can refer
to a limitation in one part of the
pipeline but maybe not others so you
might have other parts of the GPU that
are completely unutilized meaning that
only part of the GP is truly at 100%
load and so your your thermal difference
there is going to be less significant
than an application like fur mark where
it's constantly doing work so with
something like fur marks fuzzy donut you
can cram all of the data necessary to
run the computation that it's that is
running for fur into the cache for each
cluster of shaders and then you burn
those genuinely at 100% without ever
letting up and giving them a chance to
breathe so to speak so the best way I
like to think about it is to imagine
each component as functionally its own
computer because it is at this point a
CPU is more or less a complete computer
within itself it can't exist without the
rest of the computer core it can exist
but can't really do much without the
rest of the system but if you kind of
look at the architecture of a CPU it's
got some memory in it it's got a memory
controller and it has cores and it can
do all the functions needed of a
computer it's just it needs a host
system they even have voltage regulators
and a lot of them these days you look at
a GPU same thing so they these parts
when you think of them as a full
computer within itself it's easier to
see how it can bottleneck in different
parts of the silicon but not all of the
cores or all of the the lanes on the
vectors as as it may be so you may for
example when you see a hundred percent
load on your CPU Washington 4k video
60fps on maybe a laptop with just an IEP
you might see video encoding decode
threads if you really dig for it hitting
100 percent but 3d is not really doing
anything or a copy is not really doing
anything and you can see this even
through task manager these days it's
really useful for visualizing it so
hopefully that helps you with that
question though a very good one and then
the next one is from CG Fuu who says
Steve in the PC game and video game
community more broadly we're starting to
hear more and more about the problems
with crunch culture as developers
approach release of a game and are asked
to work a high number of hours by
management
you yourself have talked about the hours
you've worked during launch review
periods in the brief window between
receiving hardware for review embargo
lifts my question is given your contacts
in the industry does a similar culture
of crunch exist on the engineering and
marketing side that the companies that
develop the products we all love to
evaluate I recognize that the time
horizon ie when the crunch happens is
probably different for someone
developing in RTX 20 80 TI compared to
The Witcher 3 but does a culture of
crunch pervade Intel AMD or Nvidia and
other firms like Asus MSI EVGA ahead of
the release of a new product not the
short answer is yes it does exist so
there was a period where for a long time
we did a game only content no hardware
anything and I worked I lived in the
game industry for that entire for a
while doing that and in fact there was
also a period when I was interested in
becoming a developer before I realized
that doing this was more enjoyable to me
more suitable to me and in that time
researching everything and talking and
interviewing with developers we have a
lot of them on on the website before we
really did any of the YouTube stuff the
type of crunch is a little bit different
in my experience so with time horizons
one thing like you said but the type of
crunch with I don't know GPU development
you kind of you don't necessarily have
everybody in the whole company under
crunch it's more like people in media
relations and technical marketing and
testing and validation those people are
really putting in the hours once the
product is in
that final week stretch before it
releases and that's because they're
dealing with often hundreds of media
finding all kinds of problems or
thinking they find problems and then
technical marketing's job is to find the
truth
PRS job is to filter the truth so that
the company doesn't get damaged by
whatever that may be
and that kind of that that week-long
period hopefully before a product lifts
is definitely a crunch period for those
that team
I know people who work at some of the
companies you mentioned I guess I won't
name any of them specifically but I know
plenty of people at all these companies
who in speaking with them at events and
before launches and things like that
they're just like walking zombies a lot
of the time which isn't too different
for media we get it bad too and it's
really for us it's it's more of what you
make of it I mean we can get away with
skipping an embargo if we really had to
and I've done it but these these people
can do this they'll be fired
so yes crunch exists and the extent of
it I think it's a little different so in
games I mean it's gotten a little better
these days from what I understand but I
know companies that it was not uncommon
where he'd be everyone in the company be
working like a hundred hour week leading
up to going gold or something and that's
obviously not really healthy for the
company I we've interviewed Richard
Garriott famous for Ultima we've
interviewed Chris Roberts famous for
Wing Commander and now star citizen
whatever you make of that doesn't really
matter for this point but speaking with
both of them especially Richard Garriott
when he was at origin I mean they had
like bunks and couches in their offices
because people would stay there and
sleep or nap and get back to work and I
remember speaking with him this is
obviously years after origin closed and
he told me about when they eventually
got rid of that stuff because they
realized that it was just burning
through people too much and the turnover
you get from people not getting a break
was worse than you know driving those
people to finish the prod
to to the standards you want because if
you lose that person than your quality
on the next thing will be lower because
you have to train someone up to speed
but I would say that's that industry is
to my knowledge a bit worse than what we
see at the companies and hardware but
absolutely there's still crunch and
hardware I I can think of individual
people at every one of these companies
you've named who work way too many hours
there's a guy well I don't need kind of
specifics I guess but there are people
who have had like serious injuries from
accidents and things like that or they
they're working from the hospital
there's people who are working just I'll
get messages at like 2:00 a.m. their
time because they're trying to follow up
make sure everything's good for launch
day and everyone bust their ass and
worked really hard and we all love it
for the most part so I mean I like what
I do and it worked again where it's like
105 hours for RTX launch so yeah we work
a lot but on the media side at least we
can control it I didn't have to work
that many hours if I didn't want to and
it is fun so it's not just work on the
company side it's it is a bit of a
problem but there's not a lot you can do
everyone's got low margins with GPU you
sell a video card you're making like 3%
margin you can't really hire enough
people to double up so that your your
main person didn't get away with you
know a ten-hour break or something on
what today so it's a problem when
margins are that's limits it's
competitive world last two so I wanted
to bring this one up I've seen it in the
past didn't see a specific person asking
this recently but in the past I've seen
people asking do you turn down ad so
what are your ad standards and I did
want to bring this one up because I just
turned a couple down so just so
everyone's aware the reason you see like
GM store ads sort of towards the end of
the month is because we've served
through all of our advertisers for what
we think are quality ads or ads worthy
of sort of being attached to our name
and so serving GN store ads at that
point helps because it helps
and sauce from selling ads to less
scrupulous companies that we don't
really think deserve to be attached to
our name or don't make a good product
and it also means that we can distance
ourselves from reliance on advertising
money in general and instead push
something like our store for example or
patreon and that just means we can be
more independent and and keep the
reviews material as financially distant
as possible from the companies that
provide the review products so wanted to
bring up because I just turned down an
ad from a marketing company that
specifically wants hit up an influencer
which we are not I we don't we don't
call it there's a specific connotation
for that word and we don't call
ourselves influencers review outlet and
they wanted to influence here they
wanted like to pay for a review which is
absolutely wrong no painful reviews is
is extremely ethically bad they want it
to pay for like a I don't know a product
overview or something and some other
biessed here so I just wanted to know
why you see the store ads because we've
posted like four in a row at the end of
the month so I figured I'd mentioned why
it's because we turn down ads that are
we think low-quality
or that compromise integrity and then
the last one here there are some people
one guy specifically one person one
person asked so AMD is responsible for
its board partners on the RX 580 2048
review where I was bashing AMD for
launching a misleading GPU and I think
there was some stuff lost in translation
there because it was a China only
product but that data lands card isn't
the only one so there's like all the
vendors in China have the ability to
make this rx 580 2048 the reason for
that is because AMD made that GPU so I
want to make that really clear because I
don't know if I thought I made it clear
enough but I guess not that is an AMD
product the rx 580 2048 you can go to
Andy's website and it's there so it's
not like data land went rogue and made
their own silicon or made their own cut
out rebranded
five seventy whatever that wasn't that
that was an AMD product and this happens
we're like the board partners are not
going to rebrand GPUs they will no
longer be a board partner if they do
that and their business will die so
justice everyone understands how it
works I think about everyone pretty much
does but GPU supplier Nvidia AMD works
with the board partner they sell them
the GPU often the memory attached to the
PCB the board partner is responsible for
figuring out the PCB if they don't buy
the reference one and they're
responsible figuring out the cooler
maybe a custom fan curve stuff like that
but they have nothing to do with making
the GPU itself and the only time you
really see scams is typically on ebay
from a no-name person who is maybe
flashing BIOS or something in spoofy and
the cards name and we've shown that in
the past before but that's not the same
thing here sorry that's all for this
