this time of the 2080 ti reference card
or the founders edition card as they
call it these days what with the
confusing prices and all that so the
founders edition card has taken quite a
change from the previous reference card
and video designs the first major change
for them in many years and the biggest
change obviously is going dual axial
cooler instead of a single radial fan or
blower fan and that is what we've been
sort of questioning in terms of Nvidia's
motive of does it push some of the lower
and a IV partner cards out of the market
and we'll see what it does in terms of
the rest of the market but for the card
itself it is somewhat necessary because
this is a lot of power and a blower fans
it's not going to cut it and they've
instead gone for dual axial fans this
card for the cooler is identical to the
2080 for the PCB there are some
differences we'll talk about that later
but for today we're just going to take
this apart go through the different
screws if you want to take yours apart
for a liquid cooling mod or something
like that and also talk about the power
solution on the vrm before that this
video is brought to you by the
Thermaltake level 20 VT micro ATX case
the level 20 VT takes the high quality
at level 20 design and makes it more
affordable and shrinks it down to a
micro ATX form factor at that with fully
modular paneling it's possible to
rearrange this case into whatever
configuration you prefer for a micro ATX
case that can be a discussion piece in a
home theater system click the link in
the description below quick for note on
this and video sent out a memo at about
6 p.m. 15 hours before embargo lifts
which is very courteous saying that
disassembly was explicitly
disallowed and so we were going to hold
this content but it appears that Nvidia
did not send this memo to all media only
to u.s. media and it was at 6 p.m.
Eastern Time so half the world is
already asleep so a very poor
organization by Nvidia but regardless
it's out there now their NDA explicitly
states that anything that's in public
domain can be talked about and so we can
therefore show our teardown and there
was really no reason not to show it
anyway because Nvidia posted their own
3d graphics of the card taken apart
anyway so
very odd decision-making on the videos
part very last minute and felt extremely
targeted regardless let's walk through
the card and see what it looks like time
to do the teardown we have a few tools
for the job here not involving tweezers
this time the verge instead we're gonna
start with a pair of digital calipers
and get the new mounting hole size that
you're doing a water mod you probably
need that so this is 98.5 ish so let's
just call it 98 98 millimeters of course
it's going to be squared yes 98.5
senator centers to call it 98 millimeter
Center to Center for the hole spacing so
there's your GPU hole space in a few are
a maker of liquid cooling parts that'll
probably be helpful as well we are also
going to be using our iFixit Pro Tech
tool kit and they haven't been a sponsor
for a while for just normal ads but they
do make a good product and we'll link up
below if you want to pick one up because
we're gonna need it for this as it does
have some allen key screws it's got
multiple size Phillips and videos
reference design cards are typically
very complicated just with regard to all
the different mounting hardware they use
it's it's a lot of different screws size
is totally unnecessary but it's part of
their shi shi high-end want to be
designed that they go with so let's
let's start taking it apart this one
should be pretty straightforward overall
we'll start with some phillips action
and get the the cold plate loosened up
but we're not going to completely remove
it yet most likely underneath these
small screws on the other side they're
probably screwing into another screw
that's typically what nvidia does and
this card is going to be complex enough
that we will be tracking the screw
removal on our mod mat which you can
grab on store deck game is XS net if
you'd like to pick up your own because
there are a lot of screws so want to
make sure we get them all back in the
same spot for reassembly we're not going
to go over that in this video but just
as I note these tiny screws that I'm
taking out right now these are extremely
easy to break they use Loctite to mount
them so if you are reassembling in the
with the original cooler and you screw
in just pass where
starts getting tight it'll probably snap
at the stem so don't do that just just
turn it until it stops and do not go any
further with these so that's all the
small screws so far and let's count
those up we have two four six eight ten
twelve fourteen of the really small
screws just laid out this is how they go
back in this is our again this is our
anti-static mod mat it's got a layout of
the GPU so we can easily track where
they go and again is on stored our game
is exes net if you want to pick one up
there on backorder coming in this week I
think or the next so they should be
shipping out soon so let's loosen the
rest of these four big screws either
these are the spring retention screws
for the cooler and the cold plate and
you'll see that these are not coming
straight out I'm like cards past which
would indicate there well it might come
out it's got like a washer or a hook on
the other end of it so we're gonna leave
that alone and take off the rest of the
backplate first if we can and then see
if there's something holding those in
because I haven't taken this apart yet
so you are seeing the screws and the
locations for the first time with me
today okay so this backplate is a little
bit insane I'll show you why in a moment
here's why it's insane it looks like a
whole lot of metal especially when you
look from here because that looks
awfully thick but in reality it's a very
thin sheet and you can see that here too
and even feels plasticky but it is in
fact metal aluminum it's got this glossy
coating on the inside to prevent any
shorts between SMDs that might touch the
back plate if some legs poked through or
you lost a thermal pad or something then
throwing pads in all the key areas so we
have a thermal pad on the backside of
the inductor line over here we have
throne pads on the backside of the
memory which is fairly common but not as
common as it should be a thermal pad on
the back
the GPU core itself and then throw all
pads on this side which is probably an
extension of the vrm so that is most
likely going into the the left half of
the card vrm depend on your orientation
so let's let's get the rest of this off
this is the envy link cover coveted
cover that I'm really was very proud of
there's the back plate not very advanced
but has lots of thrown pads on it so
should I actually get used so that's
good okay and then these screws now are
coming out easily so they were just
caught on the backside of the back plate
and as as called out it's exactly the
same approach as previous efi cards so
nvidia is using a set of hex small hex
heads that the small Phillips heads
thread into we'll find out what size
that is momentarily same size as
previously I believe that would be a 4
that's a 4 millimeter hex driver so we
have an equal amount of these to pull
out so they're like 14 something like
that and each one corresponds with one
of the smaller screws on the other side
these are going into the base plate as
well of the card on the top cooler side
okay that should be all of the four
millimeter hex screws so at this point
we have some screws in the i/o plate and
it looks like some of those might go
into the shroud not a lot a hundred
percent clear on that but typically they
don't so let's try removing it first if
it doesn't come off there are two more
screws exposed in here by the way but
those two screws should just be for
separating some of the internal
components of the shroud and the base
plate so we're gonna try and leave
everything else alone right now
and just see if the card will separate
actually can already tell it's not
because this needs to come off so the
next step is to remove then the i/o
over the PCIe expansion cover and for
that we have a couple screws that go
into the base plate and a couple that
just go into the IO IO areas so you got
two three four probably in the base
plate
okay there's the cover removed which
apparently says mo 1 to1 nosh not sure
what the meaning of that is but that's
the manufacturing stamp a whole lot of
thermal pads on this thing kind of idiot
called EVGA for help with this design
amount of thermal pads they have here
here's what we've got we've got one
ribbon cable for everything
so that's fans it's a synchronous fan
control it's LEDs all that stuff on one
it looks like we have two sets of
thermal pads for the choke so there's a
blue pad at the bottom and then some of
the center chokes have a more standard
nvidia style canvas pad which is
probably from fuji poly or similar
supplier normal nvidia pads 3 maybe
roughly 3 watts per meter Kelvin pads on
everything so inductor line choke or
chokes right here inductors right there
MOSFETs a capacitor bank capacitor bank
VRAM VRAM VRAM so on the card then we
have capacitor bank capacitor bank
inductors everything's covered so they
have a lot going on for this they have
all the small SMD is covered so it's a
lot of a lot of care going into it which
considering they're using a vapor
chamber that a hundred percent covers
this entire surface this has to be done
because there is zero air flow here or
very near zero anyway that gets to the
PCB itself you can see now the fans are
entirely obstructed by the base plate
there are no cutouts anywhere unlike
most the other aftermarket Ford partner
cards and that's because on video is
using a giant vapor chamber for their
cooler we'll look at that in a minute
and so because of this layout if there's
not thermal pad contact to the component
it doesn't get cooled ever so that's
that's their decision-making for that
let's
let's go ahead and clean off the dye and
that's some very hard into their own
taste
and then take a look at the the Assembly
of the vapor chamber and the base plate
so same one k1 same as the other ones
we've seen say tu 102 300 a k1 part and
then a revision a 1k one is a signifier
for which memory module is missing which
in this case is the same as the a C's
card it's that one right there
so this is clean enough for now we'll
get the rest later before we assembly
and we'll leave that alone actually for
now so PCB components will go over next
but they are ready to look at first we
want to look at the cooler and this is
where it gets a bit more complex to take
apart so we have Phillips heads on this
side this is going to be one of the
longer tear downs so two on the far side
that go on the underside of the cooler
gonna try and keep those isolated so we
know where they go later and there's
probably no separation yet there's not
any separation yet so now we need to
start pulling out these allen keys and
this is the first 20 series founders
Edition I've taken apart so let's let's
just start with the large ones get kind
of a base to work off of here just so
that it's not contacting anything so I
don't have to worry about those thermal
pads
what size is this
so an hour iFixit protec toolkit this is
a size 2.5 allen key again that should
be linked below if you want to pick one
up it's it's a link that will let them
know you're buying from our link so they
will appreciate that
so 2.5 on these just get all these out
there's four of them then a smaller
allen key for the hole that one's gone
forever for the embellishments on the
side I'll pull that out in a moment
these are very similar to the old asus
strix fans before they changed it for
this generation as well alright so that
was 2.5 I think the embellishments on
the sides are probably a 2.0 Hey yep 2.0
ish on those so we've got two here and
two on the other side and that winds
gonna come off so that much is the same
as the previous design those don't come
out yet so at this point what have we
taken apart okay there's another couple
screws over here so we have two screws
on this side which side of the card is
this this is going to be on the side
opposite the power connector so this is
closer to the i/o so we have a couple
more that are buried in there and
there's our Phillips heads
yeah I don't work so large PA or a
phillips-head Wan will work for that
these on the top okay a lot of screws
right now this just this is why the
bottom that's useful have a lot of stuff
to put back in later a whole lot this is
an absurd amount of screws is this loose
yet kind of there's some some separation
of stuff that knotch looks like it's
there on purpose to like to pry or
something I think we're being held up by
these embellishments on the side so I
need to figure out how to remove these
last time I worked on one of these it
snapped and it may do that again that is
some pretty fragile metal yep for sure
would snap I think this plastic has to
come out
where's the
where's the hiding part there's gotta be
a screw somewhere you really don't want
this thing disassembled oh I see screws
in there okay so there are screws you're
not gonna be able to see them on the
camera but we've identified why this
won't come off unfortunately before
causing it attached to it so there are
just if you watch where the screwdrivers
going you're not gonna be able see it
there screws in there between the fins
and the top part of the crap the shroud
and that's what's holding that plate in
so we're not gonna be able to pop that
out until we can get those screws
removed which means that this entire
thing removes as one unit from the base
plate and the vapor chamber it's just a
matter of figuring out how they separate
and aware
just seems like it's screwed in and I
feel like this probably comes up and
reveals a screw somewhere Nvidia builds
insane cards anybody's design is like
impossible take apart it's like an Apple
product cut that out
can't take the cooler part so it's very
difficult to maintain it I guess no no
what the fuck yes so it's like this
thing separates and then this thing
separates and then under that this thing
separates and then this comes out
don't touch the thermal pads I don't
know I don't want it like there
shouldn't be a screw hiding under there
all that would be stupid so no that's
not it either
wouldn't surprise me if anybody I
started like going the route of making
custom tools to fix their shit yeah a
lot of bike companies do that too okay
folks so this is where we stopped when
we got that notice that the tear downs
were no longer allowed and then
obviously resumed it later recording
this audio about 12 hours later or less
than that even so we stopped here at
attempting to think about the cooler
tried another hour or so pushing on
different parts trying to figure out
where it's connected and for now you
know what we're just gonna leave it as
is there if you see something really
obvious that I'm overlooking I'm taking
apart the cooler let us know but we've
looked under every thermal pad we've
pushed on all the different things the
cooler the the vapor chamber itself is
loose now and it appears to be connected
by thermal pads not by solder to the
base plate so it's loose
and it should come free but at this
point we are going to leave the rest of
it together and we'll look at taking
apart this cooler separately in the
future it's been a long long night
because we got that email about not
allowing tear downs after we had already
filmed our teardown most of it anyway
and so we built our whole day around
that then we had to flip everything and
film that architecture video and so I
had video crew working 12 hours I worked
I slept two hours worked all the others
so yeah we're gonna stop here hopefully
hopefully you're okay with that for for
this one given the circumstances we
would have finished the cooler itself
but that that memo did kind of throw a
wrench in things so anyway we'll talk
about the rest of this later maybe for
our hybrid mod but you've seen the rest
of the disassembly for now so let's cut
back to the rest of the video so for the
PCB this one is a 13 plus 3 phase and
the other card should be an eight phase
or V core and a six phase for V core for
the 2070 in the 2080 an opposite order
to this one see one two three four five
six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 yes
so 13 plus 3 for core and memory
respectively there are two voltage
domains on these cards so you have one
four core and one for memory and for the
MOSFETs they look like on semi 31 70s
and will perhaps throw this to build
Zoid for more information on those but
that's they look like from here the
memory used is micron memory on this
card we haven't taken apart enough yet
to know if there are other suppliers in
the in the field yet or if it's just
micron to start with we have a small
power regulator over here that'll be
discussed more in our asus video that
handles some VIN and current steering
and then for shunt resistors we haven't
tried a shunt mod on this yet but if we
were to try one there's a shunt right
there so you got a shunt resistor there
and it looks like there's a shunt
resistor there as well so those should
correspond to these we're just not sure
in what order but those would be our two
five million ohms shunt resistors that
you could try shorting we might do that
later but that's that's the PCB that's
what we can talk about from now with
this and we might do more later with
build Zoid or you can check our Asus
video for other information on their PCB
so that's the founders Edition card this
isn't videos attempt at becoming Apple
they're trying to become the Apple of
video cards it is nearly impossible it's
not hard to get the PCB exposed this is
not difficult so if you want to water
cool it getting this far is not hard if
you wanted to take the rest of the
cooler apart maybe for service or
maintenance it's pretty difficult and
just to give you a count for the screws
to my left
not counting the rest of the screws
inside of the cooler there are over 50
of them I don't have an exact count but
it sits between 50 and 55 somewhere in
that range just for the screws to expose
this and then start exposing the rest of
the cooler now if you're just taking the
PCB out it's probably closer to
something like 35 to 40 screws which is
still completely insane but this is why
these cards are expensive the tooling or
what the factory process who knows what
that cost buying a million screws and
then using thick aluminum in places
where you don't necessarily need it I
guess it looks nice and it makes the
card really heavy in unnecessary ways so
if you're going for that quality buy
feel approach then NVIDIA has achieved
that but man what a what a pain to take
the cool air apart or even begin to
Daddy the PCB exposed again not that
different from the 1080 series or the
980 series it's the same process same
screws same tools so you need like a 4
millimeter hex you need a just large
Phillips small Phillips like pH 1
something like that and then
that's more or less it for forgetting to
the PCB the hex is the big one and then
for taking apart the rest you need some
allen keys 2.5 4.0 stuff like that so
anyway that's the 20 atti founders
edition card if you have full teardown
now we have the asus card separately on
the channel definitely check for that we
should already have an architecture
piece on the channel if you're
interested in the touring architecture
at a technical level and and how it all
works we have a video on that and then
benchmarks if they're not up already
will be up shortly we had a different
embargo for those so although some
testing obviously can occur between
before the benchmarks release the
unboxings and things like that we're
allowed to go up earlier along with the
technical white paper discussion and
stuff like that so anyway subscribe go
to stored on cameras next it's not nets
picking up the mod mat featured in this
video which you know normally I don't
necessarily need to put the screws in a
diagram anymore I've done it enough
where I don't need the screw track them
for this card yeah it's it's a good kid
I have to use my own tool so you can
pick that up on the store patreon.com
slash gamers Nexus otherwise thanks for
watching and subscribe for more I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
