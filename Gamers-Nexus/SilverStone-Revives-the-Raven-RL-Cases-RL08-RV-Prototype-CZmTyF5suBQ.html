at CES 2019 but you couldn't tell
because it's the same suite every year
Silverstone always does things that are
typically you get some stuff on display
that's still concept and I mean that's
nice look at some of the other stuff we
saw this year where it was it was a
finished product that clearly wasn't
supposed to be there and was a
placeholder so there's some concept
stuff here like the Raven and then
there's some more or less finalized
stuff before that this video is brought
to you by the deep cool captain 240 Pro
AO cooler the captain 240 Pro uses a
bladder within the water tank to expand
and contract based on liquid temperature
as a leak prevention mechanism this
works by birthing air at higher
temperatures making for a unique
closed-loop liquid cooler design the
captain 240 Pro also expands upon the
existing captain series by extending
tube lengths for more flexible
positioning and updating the LEDs
learn more at the link in the
description below the red line oh eight
the the are l06 of course many of you
are familiar with from our coverage one
of the best performers we tested in its
size category and it's price class the
rlo eight follows the same trend or at
least the same external appearance of
having a mesh front which is nice to see
this borrows the tooling of the chassis
from one of the LDC R series cases and
it's pretty evident by the chimney on
the side that we talked about last year
but it's got a red stripe on it so it
fits the red line series technically
could go white if you want the
alternative version in terms of the case
layout mesh front mesh top there's dust
filter with magnetic dust filter and
then the front has two 140 millimeter
fans back has one 120 millimeter fan the
price should be about a hundred bucks I
believe for this case and that's what
those fans included other than that it
is an inverted micro ATX layout micro
ATX has had a bit of a revival lately
and Coolermaster as an example said that
there I think if there q500 was one of
their better selling cases for the past
year because there's such limited good
micro ATX competition on the market so
you can count this as an entrance to
that competition the RL zero eight and
because it's inverted you get the
interesting effect of having the video
card facing up just like with any other
inverted case so if you did mount fans
up here
you probably want to do intake to blow
just straight into the GPU fan and the
effect is functionally the same as
between a side intake in a standard
orientation case we've got direct intake
straight into the fan except the fan is
more exposed in this stance than where
it's horizontal it I guess is basically
a vertical orientation GPU with side
intake which you don't really see
anywhere so from a cooling standpoint
this looks promising and we'll test it
as always but it does look promising
the default fan spec is good the the
price for micro ATX is about where it
should be and I think at this point
we're just curious about how many of you
are buying micro ATX to let us know
because I know the the NZXT Vulcan when
that one Yoel a lot of people in our
audience were disappointed the next case
is a revival of the Ravens series and
the Raven series case is our v02 has
been on the top of the thermal charts
for a long time and it's a bit of a
problem because it's making it hard for
anyone else to win the best of bench
Awards because the RB 0-2 has been
sitting there for so hon so RB 0 2 is
still up there this is a revival it
doesn't have a product name yet it
doesn't have a price yet it's an a'
prototype status so what you're seeing
on the front of the case is not final
not much is 100% final so we'll ask you
to be open-minded and maybe leave
suggestions or what you'd like to see
below so one example this glossy front
panel should probably change one of the
considerations right now and this is
important to get your feedback on is
should it be an acrylic so sort of like
the revolt to that I wipe our made a few
years ago we've got an acrylic display
for the video card because since its
again inverted and you had actually well
slightly rotated with the video cards at
the front you could display those video
cards and the video card shroud is one
of the most iconic pieces of pcs so I
guess that might be appealing to some of
you but let us know because silverstone
has the opportunity here to make changes
still so one thing discussed is changing
this with a slightly tinted acrylic
could go clear acrylic or black out with
a matte color kind of like the rest of
the case the back is still in
finalization
the back of the chassis is still in
finalization stages but the interior
you're more or less getting you see what
you get already bottom is still two of
the large fans the 180 millimeters the
air penetrators which we reviewed
previously the one of the AP 81-81 the
original and then a follow-up to that
these are AP 180 threes so a few updates
from the RV zero to that we reviewed
originally double ball bearing whereas
the original the AP 181 was a sleeve I
think the AP 182 went to a double ball
bearing as well for the RPMs it's
looking like 400 to 1500 on the 183 s
that are in this case which is an uptick
from the 1200 rpm max of the original
that I was talking about earlier 40%
less power consumption for the fan at
1500 rpm versus the previous max of 1200
rpm which is significant so it's not
even rpm matched and it's still down pwm
which is important as well and then the
rest of this is going to be case side
stuff so I think we have shots of this
coming off and there's a 120 on the top
with the grille on it which is helpful
for sort of just targeting the airflow
the back side has had important updates
so the biggest problem with good cases
that are old is that trends like cable
management weren't a thing yet this has
had updates for cable management it's
had updates for some radiator support so
the side over here can do it to 80
millimeter radiator the back is again
basically TBD but the side can do to 80
so that's a good improvement as well
it's just I think from a performance
standpoint because it's so similar in
the important ways to the RB 0 to accept
improved with the fans performance is
looking fine it's just going to come
down to looks and that's where I mean we
can't really we can say I say what I
think but I think you need to hear what
the wider audience thinks so what
happens to the front panel let me know
what you think my opinion if you want to
pause and leave your comment first is
probably go with an acrylic just because
it be unique because you could see the
video card and that is a display piece
rather than the front of the case
natively it's sort of interesting to me
but maybe not a good seller so let us
know and then
the back panel I think should probably
be flattened but if you disagree feel
free to post your comments silverstone
will will potentially read them or i'll
send them the ones that aren't trolling
and me me otherwise that's it for
silverstone suite hundred dollars for
this one
