whose name is going to trip us up for
the entirety of its existence the GTX
1660 Ti is Nvidia's mid step between
Pascal and taurine keeping most of the
Turing architectural changes to the SMS
in the memory subsystem but dropping the
official RT act support and RT core is
in favor of a lower price the EVGA gtx
1660 TI that we're reviewing today the
XC model should have a list price of a
$280 sticking it between the $350 base
line of the RT x 2060 and the rough $200
price point of modern gtx 1060 s
although sometimes that's higher for
further reference at vega 56 now sells
closer to $280 to 300 with RX 590 is
still around the $260 range today we're
looking at the 1660 TI XC model and
we'll have a teardown up separately if
you want that before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte z 390 ARS
master motherboard which comes equipped
with one of the more powerful z3 90 V
RMS for heavier overclocks on the new
9th Gen Intel CPUs the ARS Master is
also one of the few motherboards with a
really heatsink this generation
featuring a mix of high surface area
fins and looks oriented hover blocks oh
and it's also got updated RGV
illumination learn more at the link
below
the last Nvidia card that we reviewed
was the RT X 2060 of course it's the
next most recent one and overall we were
fairly positive on it it was the best
showcase from Nvidia to date on its RT X
series the price point made more sense
the performance for the price made more
sense in the scaling in terms of the
percent spent over a predecessor versus
that percent before one - gained felt
good it really felt pretty reasonable
compared to the 2080 for example which
we simply couldn't recommend that launch
especially the 1080i still out so Nvidia
as the SKUs have come down in the to the
lower end has improved it's sort of
value proposition we'll see if that
continues with the 16 60 TI today
especially with and these more
aggressive price cuts on some of its
existing competitors the first question
though is why the name and so Nvidia
said the quote here is as far as naming
goes under why 16 Series instead of just
using 11 quite simply we felt that from
an overall architecture and performance
perspective
tu 1:16 is closer to the other tu 10x
parts than it is to the prior generation
GP 10x T 116 has most of the Torian
architectural features including the new
dedicated cores for in 32 and FP 16
operations and it also has all the
nutrients 18 features including variable
rate shading and mesh shading and as you
see performance it's closer to the g4s
RT x 2060 than it is to the 10 60 in
fact like you said at performance
closest to the 1070 beating it in some
games and losing and some others so we
ultimately settle on 16 60 TI instead of
11 60 TI confirming that 16 is in fact
numerically closer to 20 so fair enough
fair enough on the answer to that that's
why it was named that though if you were
curious we obviously are not offended by
its name but a lot of people were making
fun of it rather fairly so we thought
we'd just ask why that's the answer
but there's more important stuff to talk
about today so some differences in
architecture versus Pascal quite a few
it's actually as I said much closer to
taurine if you were to just look at the
spec sheet for this or put it up on the
screen you would see that the 1660 ti
has two times the SM count over the 1060
that's not a linear comparison because
the SM layout change significantly from
Pascal so just like the rest of the
touring cards the SMS are now cut down
to 64 CUDA cores per SM rather than 128
and that's why you see that difference
of a two times increase in s times but
not a 2 times increase in CUDA cores and
there's still other differences that's
not to downplay anything just to
illustrate that that's a non linear
number do not compare just SM count
doesn't mean anything if you do that so
to highlight some of the other
differences this SM block diagram better
illustrates the changes to the assembly
out and taurine as a refresh we didn't
see it before we now see FP 32 lanes
alongside in 32 and FP 16 and 32
processing can now be done in parallel
to FP 32 which has proven beneficial in
some games with heavier compute
workloads like Wolfenstein 2 or Sniper
Elite 4 or shadow of war as opposed to
by the way the 10 series and its
preference to instead interrupt the
pipeline with each instruction turning
can now do them in parallel FP 16 also
get some more focus here at P 16 has
been really interesting since Andy
started making that push for its rapid
packed math discussion on Vega because
for the most part we haven't really seen
a lot about P 16 usage in games it's
primarily useful for things like
learning a machine learning where you
can really throw away a lot of your data
accuracy because you have so much data
that it just doesn't matter if you have
billions of images for example but FP 16
in games it's if you don't know about P
16 can be referred to as half precision
it is less precise than FP 32 but FP 16
is still useful for speeding up the
pipeline for things like for example
apparently according to Nvidia water
effects and water simulation in Far Cry
5 we haven't validated exactly the water
simulation performance or behavior in
Far Cry 5 but according to Nvidia that
is one area where FP 16s gettin usage in
the gaming world and we'll see if that
sort of starts to spread more because it
would uplift performance significantly
when you can get away with it you could
not get away with it for things that
need accuracy like accurate physics
simulation or hitboxes things like that
so the 16 60 TI ends up with turns
architectural changes the integer
pipeline changes are in there that we
discussed previously in an interview at
CES with Nvidia but also it acts as the
RT cores and the tensor core so price is
offset and it's a non r-tx product and
then finally a memory subsystem moves to
the significantly faster GD d r 6
platform from gddr5 5x and so forth and
the baseline native speed is 12 gigabits
per second on the t1 16 and well with
the memory that's used with t1 16 rather
so other improvements also move over an
ven see improvements for example but
memories the big one
the memory speed on most the card should
be about 12 gigabits per second you can
overclock it to about 14 plus as we did
here today so let's get into the testing
we'll start with probably Apex legends
and look through the rest of our
benchmarks Talk thermals overclock and
stuff like that first up is Apex legends
and we'll put some gameplay footage on
the screen if you're not familiar with
the title but of course note that this
is not direct benchmark capture so apex
legends is a highly populated branded
DirectX 11 title for comparison we just
posted a large benchmark study on this
one the show performance scaling across
multiplayer and different zones of the
game as the map is at large and view
distances are pretty long so that does
impact performance heavily we ultimately
decided that multiplayer testing is
consistent enough for test patterns that
we could get a realistic look at
performance without having to use any
sort of synthetic test the down
is that we don't have as many cards
tested in this game as we do for the
others coming up so you'll have to look
at our other game benchmarks for cards
like the gtx 1070 but let's look anyway
at how apex legends runs on the 1660 ti
at 1080p and with all settings at high
the gtx 1660 TI XE ends up at 92 FPS
average with lows spaced reasonably
behind this lands the 1660 ti as between
the RX 590 fatboys 89 FPS average and
Vega 56 is 106 FPS average the 1660 ti
ends up about three percent better than
the rx 590 which is way outside of our
zero point seven FPS average standard
deviation from the mean so this isn't
far from GPU silicon quality boosting
range of variants and they're really
functionally about the same when it
comes to gameplay the difference between
the 590 and the 1660 ti is insignificant
- not noticeable to the player frame
times are functionally equally spaced on
each with differences of landing within
the larger standard deviation of our
0.1% lows and 1% lows notably versus the
gtx 1066 gigabyte that the 1660 TI sort
of replaces it ends up about 29% ahead
as you'll see in our other charts this
is comparable to a 1070 in performance
the 1660 ti that is versus the new RT x
2060 however the one that preceded the
1660 TI m launched the 2060 leads the
1660 TI by 22% for average FPS
overclocked in the 1660 TI with a + 125
megahertz core offset and + 11 20
megahertz memory offset gets it to
nearing equivalence with the vega 56
card on the charge and narrowing the
stock 2060s lead to about 10 point 6
percent before of course you could
overclock it higher here's a frame time
performance chart to better illustrate
the frame the frame behavior of each of
the tested devices lower frame times are
better but more consistent frame times
are best the 1660 TI ends up plotting at
about 12 milliseconds per frame on
average with variants frames of frame
well under 4 milliseconds for
perspective users do not typically
notice frame to frame interval variants
less than 8 to 12 milliseconds from the
previous frame in this regard the 1660
TI does well for testing overall and
plotting the overclocked 16 60 TI next
we can see that performance again
improves and does so without introducing
frame time in
stability this shows that the overclock
is stable you would see a lot more
spikes in there if not the rx 590 ends
up similar in performance to the
previous two lines although averages
higher in frame times and therefore
lower in framerate 1440p positions the
gtx 1660 TI closer to Vega then 1080p
does with this higher resolution the
1660 TI approves capable of frame rates
equal to or north of 60 fps with high
settings although obviously FPS can go
up with the settings reduction we're at
67 FPS average one stock ranking the car
dies about 9% faster than the XFX rx 590
or fury X although the fury X struggles
fiercely in frame time consistency and
as an objectively worse performance than
either the 590 or the 1660 TI the 1660
TI also outperforms that you want kin
980ti by 13% but is led by Vega 56 by 5%
as for the gap between this $280 1660 TI
and $350 RT x 2060 that's a 25% price
increase which amounts to about a 23
percent performance increase not bad
really especially considering that we
thought the 2060 was Nvidia strongest
offering to date for the RT X series
f1 2018 is next giving us another
DirectX 11 game before getting on to
Sniper Elite 4 for f1 2018 at 1080p the
16 60 TI ends up at 104 FPS average
which is exactly tied with the Vega 56
reference card although a good bit
behind our more recently tested Vega 56
red dragon lows remain advantaged on the
AMD cards in this game the 16 60 TI
outperforms the 980 TI marginally and
out stretches the 1070 SC by 2.9 percent
compared to the RX 5 nineties 82 FPS
average the 16 60 TI runs about 28%
higher in frame rates at 1440p
the 16 60 TI ends up running at 80 FPS
average landing it slightly ahead of the
1070 although functionally tied and just
below the 980 TI again functionally tied
Vega 56 reference is in the vicinity as
well with the over clocks at 16 60 TI
ending up below the red dragon kart
scaling is about the same here as in the
previous chart with the 16 60 TI ending
up about even with the gtx 1070 better
than the
90 and average frame rate and worse than
the 56 in frame time consistency and if
comparing against the better partner
model 56 also the 56 red dragon does
better in average FPS Sniper Elite for
ease is direct x12 unlike the previous
two games and also has asynchronous
compute support for this one we run
tests at 4k and at 1080p the game runs
well at both resolutions on most cards
but for the 1660 TI 4k acts more like a
synthetic test to see how it stacks up
against other cards we've tested at that
4k resolution the 1660 TI stock card
ends up at 46 FPS average putting it
just ahead of the rx 590 fat boy with
functionally equivalent lows compared to
the 1070 the GTX 1660 ti ends up
marginally worse
although overclocking puts it ahead of
the 1070 se stock card and below the 980
TI hybrid our 1080p chart is much more
limited for Sniper Elite as we only
recently added it but the 1660 ti XC
ends up at 126 FPS average stock ranking
it as about tied with the overclocked rx
590 but behind the RT x 2060
overclocking the 1660 di pushes it to
nearing 140 FPS average allowing the
2060 stock card a 13% lead although you
could obviously overclock the 2060 for
more gains GTA 5 gives us an old popular
DirectX 11 title that's mostly getting
content updates at this point and not
seen much by way of driver or game
optimizations at 1080p the 16 60 TI
stock card runs at 95 FPS average
placing it just between the Vega 56
reference and Vega 56 red dragon cards
when both are running at stock settings
lows are also nearby the 16 60 TI stock
cards 95 FPS average outperforms the
stock MSI GTX 1066 gigabyte gaming X is
83 FPS average by about 15 percent
further outperforming the rx 598
gigabyte fatboys 76 FPS average by about
26% which is a stark contrast from our
apex legends benchmark note that the GTX
1060 has always done better relative to
the rx 5 ATM GTA 5 specifically sort of
seeing this continue in the 16 60 TI is
really no surprise it's just this
particular game does favour the 10
series and now I guess the 16 series as
odd
I mean is the 1660 t-i-is outperformed
by the stock 1070 SC in this title which
runs at 106 FPS average and leads by a
sort of an impressive 11% regarding
overclocking the 1660 TI overclock gets
us to 102 FPS average leading the 1660
TI XE stock card by 6.4 percent and
nearing the vega 64 performance in GTA 5
at 1440p the gt-r 1660 TI XE stock card
operates at 69 FPS average ranking it
again between both Vega 56 models that
we've recently tested and about nineteen
point five percent ahead of the GTX 1066
gigabyte stock cards 57.9 FPS average
overclocking the 1660 TI XE planted at
73 FPS average with the low as
reasonably spaced for this title this
allows the 16 60 TI to approach the
Strix Vega 64 outpaced the 980 TI hybrid
73 FPS average and approach the 1070 SCS
76 FPS average although the 1070 holds a
technical lead here the experiential
difference is functionally zero to the
player far cry 5 as we always say is
valuable for its heavy reliance on long
draw distances and screen space
reflections at 1080p the 1660 TI XC
operates at 94 FPS average ranking it as
about 7% fashion the 980 TI hybrid and
about 21% faster than the ex of x RX 590
stock card 78 FPS average although
overclocked 590 performance isn't all
that different the gtx 1070 runs roughly
tied with a 16 60 TI with its 96 FPS
average art ranking the 16 60 TI by
adjust 2.5% ahead of this way gives the
six reference and power colors Vega 56
rests just beyond reach of these 16 60
TI performance with these 16 60 TI
overclocked Landing between the two at
99 FPS average the RT x 20 60 meanwhile
leads the stock 16 60 TI by 14%
although the overclocked closes that gap
at 1440p the gtx 660ti operates at 66
FPS average for far cry 5 planting it
has functionally tied with the GTX 970
se stock card and not too distant from
Vega 56 the overclocked 16 60 TI ties
the reference Vega 36 card 69 FPS
average although is outpaced by the red
dragon Vega 46 card 74 FPS average the
16 60 TI does reasonably well at 1440p
with elevated grab
settings and some drops to settings
would allow obviously a higher framerate
shadow of the Tomb Raider and it's
modified crystal engine come up next for
this one running at 1080p high we
measured the 1660 ixc at 83 FPS average
putting it as functionally tied with the
gtx 1070 lows are within margin of error
between the two the card ends up about
15% ahead of the RX 590 Fatboy 72 FPS
average and even further ahead of the
gtx 1066 gigabyte 62 FPS average wooden
stock overclocking the 16 60 TI gets it
288 FPS average ranking the card close
to the 1070 TI but still permitting the
10 so DCI elite of about 5% at 1440p the
gtx 1660 TI XE proves that a minor
settings adjustment would easily permit
a 60 FPS average baseline although our
standardized tests have the card at 57
FPS average with lows very close behind
illustrating consistent frame time
performance the GTX 970 SC ends up at 55
FPS average here so these 16 60 TI takes
a slight lead the stock 16 60 TI ends up
between the stock red dragon 56 and the
two rx 590 benchmarks that we have on
this chart power consumption is up next
for this we're using total system power
consumption as logs from the wall so
this is not individual component
consumption the test system is heavily
controlled including all voltages in
BIOS so the only thing changing is the
GPU power consumption for our
standardized ashes of the singularity
power consumption test we see the gtx
1660 TI stock system pulling about 260
watts at peak with average power
consumption in the range of 230 to 250
watts for total system draw we won't be
plotting the overclocked 16 60 TI here
because our XC model does not change it
has a fixed power target of 100% and no
higher the power consumption of the card
peaks at about 130 watts and that's for
gpu-z numbers not total system numbers
and it stops there so just to be clear
there's no a power offset for the 16 60
TI but we'll look at overclocking
numbers next the RX 590 applauds after
this showing us a higher ceiling at 325
watts total system power consumption the
line remains study here as the boosting
algorithms and power balancing are less
aggressive than on the Nvidia cards the
delta is between about 65 watts and 120
watts
depending on which part of the test
you're comparing for perspective against
another Nvidia
card.the r-tx 2060 total system draw
ends up at about 262 290 watts
so we'll just plot that line now as well
there's not a massive difference between
the 1660 TI and the 2060 when you're
looking at the low end of one and the
high end of the other so you have to be
careful look at the overall average as
the line does move based on what part of
the test it's in overclocking the EVGA
gtx 1660 TI x he proved straightforward
seen as we had no control over
increasing the power target that said EB
J's card does run a 10 watt higher power
target than the reference 1660 TI board
designs and so there's some baked in
overclocking Headroom it be about
equivalent to a 108 to 109 percent power
target on a reference board which has a
power target of 120 watts
whereas EVGA s does 130 watts an hour
overclock stepping chart you can see
that the first two rows illustrate no
change aside from allowing the GPU to
warm up the testing when it was just
starting the test closer to 51 degrees
Celsius the GPU boost into nineteen
hundred five megahertz on average with
the maximum boost frequency at nineteen
thirty-five megahertz this was with no
offsets of any kind as the card warmed
up looking at the second row the average
frequency dropped to eighteen
seventy-five megahertz with a 62 degree
GPU core temperature this is normal and
is just how boost stepping behaves on
NVIDIA but we like to illustrate it so
that people understand the difference in
cooler quality and what you actually get
with a higher fan speed curve once we
started really trying to overclock we
hit about twenty fifty five megahertz
peak frequency briefly but averaged
about 20 25 megahertz with a two hundred
megahertz offset to the core this proved
unstable once we started to actually
gaming and so we dropped the offset to
175 Bagger Hertz and hit an average
frequency of about twenty ten megahertz
core that's really not bad for a 16 60
TI with just a 130 watt power limit
memory was stable with a an offset of
1120 megahertz resulting in an actual
memory frequency of 1780 megahertz or
about fourteen point two gigabits per
second when looking at the effective
speed if you look at the Watts column
you'll see that we were at 130 watts for
the entire test even when stock so this
was just a matter of tuning the
frequency to fit silicon quality we did
not boost the fans to max speed for this
test so of course is a bit more room
there you can kind of look at the
maximum
frequency column to get an idea for
where you would land with maybe chilled
water for example thermals and frequency
stability are up next
starting with 3dmark firestrike extreme
as representation of frequency over time
we see that the gtx 1660 TI ends up at
nineteen thirty five megahertz peak and
only decays to eighteen ninety megahertz
as the test drags on to the 30-minute
mark this is good overall and is
indicative primarily of a reasonable
cooler and fan curve for the GPU core we
sometimes see much sharper fall-off in
frequency from peak with worst coolers
for GPU temperature the card ramps to
about sixty five degrees celsius and
attempted to remain there for
out-of-the-box thermals the gtx 1660 TI
XC has a thermal target of about 65 to
66 degrees for the stock fan curve which
is a reasonable temperature that still
allows plenty of boost Headroom plotting
fan RPM next we see that the fan ramps
to about twenty-one ad rpm once at full
load and steady-state and does not
oscillate meaningfully from that
baseline this fairly fixed fan speed
reduces the more audible and noticeable
pitch change that more variable fans
would produce and so the fan curve works
out well on this cart moving to the next
chart our power virus torture workload
places the sixteen sixty t IX C's GPU
core temperature at once again about 64
degrees Celsius this remains stable
throughout the test period with the fan
speed ramping to about 2200 rpm during
this load level let's just quickly swipe
over to the next chart to show power
consumption during the same test power
consumption during the same power virus
workload has the 1660 Ti pulling about
130 watts through the GPU core
oscillating a bit depending on the load
note that the power consumption is
plotted against the right axis here not
the left and this illustrates that this
is the maximum power target for the EVGA
card and is the same that you'd see with
an overclock concluding that it's 280
dollar products well that's what we're
told it is anyway it's before launch so
it's not online yet but 280 bucks in
theory for the AXI puts it between the
well the most relevant products would be
the our TX 2060 for which there is a
pretty linear price to performance
increase over the 16 60 Ti so that makes
the math a bit easier there 25 percent
22 percent price increase versus
performance increase in some of the
games
tested so not bad in terms of that
scaling it is it is somewhat linear to
the dollar spent you do lose the RT fee
the RT acts features RT cores there
aren't a lot of reasons to care about
that in the gaming world yet there are
far more reasons to care about that in
the development world but in the
development world you're probably buying
higher-end anyway if you are maybe ultra
budget indie developer then over 26
you'd probably make more sense if you do
want the RT x features but that's
entirely up to you and depending on what
you're developing but on the gaming side
you could probably drop the RT x stuff
at least for now for today in favor of a
lower price it's just you also lose
other traditional rasterization
performance because it's it's not a
one-to-one otherwise you do lose some
SMS and with the SM loss you is about a
bit of everything else including CUDA
course or the lanes on the vectors as it
were so the bigger comparison is
probably something like Vega 56 and
these prices at time of us filming
haven't fully taken effect yet but our
understanding is that Andy's supposed to
be dropping the price to about the same
as the 16 60 TI we can't validate that
today at time of filming so you'll have
to go look but that's what it what
should happen once this card launches so
if that's the case then here's how we
stack it up as we've said before Vega 56
and its entire existence is the easiest
to argue for in the scenarios of
enthusiasts overclocking if you just
like messing up the hardware you like
doing things like power play table mods
to increase the power target you like to
maybe change the V bios Vega is less
restricted than the Nvidia counterparts
so in those instances if you really just
like messing around with the hardware
from an enthusiast standpoint you don't
care too much about performance that
alone makes Vega 56 still worth buying
so that's been our biggest argument for
it it's just it's fun to mess around
with and do tuning on so if that's what
you're looking for it's still a good
purchase from the performance standpoint
the 16 60 TI does a whole lot to reduce
power consumption in a pretty big way
whether or not this is relevant will
depend on where you live what power
costs things that everyone has it seems
different opinions on how much they care
about
our utilization so we'll just list that
strictly as a fact and then you can
decide what to do with that information
but power consumption is pretty low on
the 1660 Ti comparatively this cards got
130 watt power target in testing looking
at the power from the drop the wall that
looks to be about accurate GPZ validates
further so it is a lower power target
than a 2060 by a bit but 2060 is more
performance to lower power consumption
than the competing A and D cards does
that matter well that depends on the
price really
how much cheaper is one than the other
if you can go with higher power
consumption if the price is lower it's a
bit easier to justify as for performance
the card is in a few different places
but on average it's about a gtx 1070 so
anywhere you see 1070 performance for
the most part with few exceptions you
could just say that's where this would
fall to so if you're looking at older
charts and you see a 1070 in a game that
you want to play that's where the 1660
ti would be and hopefully that helps you
make a decision on purchasing so this
card $280 seems about right for NVIDIA
did well - it's interesting because the
2080 was really not well received for
its price position we we more or less
condemned it and said buy anything I was
like the 1080 TI at the time which no
longer exists the 2080 ti you kind of
justified because well best and it's
hard to argue with best but it was still
obviously very expensive the 2060 came
out then and the 520 70s and suddenly
looks like kind of heroes in the archaic
landscape because the predecessors were
so willfully overpriced
that you end up in a scenario where and
video looks like the hero to its own
villain and it's a very interesting play
from Nvidia which is largely uncontested
let's rephrase that which is entirely
uncontested in the high-end market and
has some competition primarily in this
market today where this card exists or
the 2060 exists but not really at the
high end
Radeon seven sort of to some extent
competes at this point but not up until
recently so a very interesting launch
strategy but we would say that it's
working out well for the 2016 the 16 60
TI in terms of pricing because the
pricing feels about right now
and videos done well to to sort of
recuperate its price position there and
its value proposition performance wise
it's fine
it's a 1070 the 1070 does well in games
you play 1440p no problem you play 1080
no problem 4k is a bit of a stretch but
with sort of lower graphics settings
lower fidelity games no geometric
complexity you could do it for example
pac-man but other than that 1440p 1080p
it should be a really no problem
so yeah just keep an eye on the prices
for Vega 56 it's what its gonna come
down to if you like tuning stuff 56 is a
good choice and if you like the lower
power target lower power consumption I
should say and the competitive
performance overall this is a good
choice but 56 does outperform it in a
few games and sometimes noteworthy ways
so you'll just have to look game the
game and and then check the prices
online because I don't know what those
are today so it makes it really hard for
me to give you a firm yester now on 56
over 1660 ti when today at time of
filming I don't have the numbers so
that's it for this one subscribe for
more as always go to patreon.com/scishow
his next hops out directly or we go to
store that carries excess net to pick up
a mod matte like the medium mod matte on
the table here that we just made and it
sold that right away but we have them on
backorder thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
