hardware news recap for the past week we
have a couple of big news items this
week including discussion on Nvidia's
GeForce Partner Program some coffee Lake
functionality on z170 and z2 70 previous
motherboards and a couple of other cool
things along with a mini review of a
noble chair that we got in the mail
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal Grizzly makers of the
conductor hot liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee leak temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydronaut pastes
learn more at the link below the big
news item for this past week was from
Hart OCP from site owner Kyle Bennett
who broke a story about discussions on
board vendors pertaining to an Nvidia
branding initiative inure and video
branding initiative and the report makes
several strong points including one that
will just quote for you the crux of the
issue with the NVIDIA GPU comes down to
a single requirement in order to be part
of the GeForce Partner Program in order
to have access to the partner program
its partners must have its gaming brand
aligned exclusively with GeForce Bennett
stated I have read documents with this
requirement spelled out on it and video
will tell you that it is 100% up to its
partner company to be part of the GPP
and from the documents I've read if it
chooses not to be part of the program it
will lose the benefits of GPP which
include high effort engineering
engagements early attack engagement at
launch partner status game bundling
sales rebate programs at social media
and PR support marketing reports
marketing development funds and further
stating MDF is likely to stand out in
the list of lost benefits if the company
is not a GPB partner the concern raised
in the Hart OCP story primarily pertains
to gaming brands so that would not be
the AIB partner as a company but their
products sold for graphics devices so
following the example that Kyle Bennett
set will point to ROG there's no
indication of any kind that are oh geez
typically is involved with this but it's
an example he raised so we will further
that an example of a gaming brand would
be for example the ROG ares series or
ROG Strix ROG Mars whatever other series
they have those would be the brands so
in theory from what Bennett's story
states the potential restriction would
be that these brands are locked to
nvidia gpus and could not be applied
toward AMD GPUs and that's the primary
concern of the story so this would
obviously not apply to single party
vendors if you are a manufacturer who
makes components only for Nvidia there's
really no impact here because the theory
of it all is that this is a partner
program which which primarily by Kyle's
writing would restrict access to
information if you sold a same branded
component for AMD devices as foreign
video devices that's sort of what the
story lays out and the write up will be
listed in our news sources article that
we'll post below as always if you want
to read more on that so hard OCP and
it's off record contacts have raised
concern about legality of the program
they've also insinuated potential
anti-competitive practices for the
nvidia GPB which was just detailed in
greater depth in Nvidia's own blog a
couple of days ago and we haven't been
able to open dialogue with any of our
contacts about this story on or off
record so at this time we can provide no
additional information what you have is
basically hard OCP story at this time a
few months ago we reported on a story
about coffee lake becoming functional
sort of on one of the older motherboards
so anon is e 370 board and this was done
by an overclocker who managed to more or
less hack something together today
there's news on an overclocker managing
to get coffee lake cpus basically fully
functional on the z 100 series of
motherboards including an i3 eighth
generation cpu at the time previously
when we reported the initial attempts at
this nothing much could really be done
other than a boot and some basic
validation but now the overclock net
post by route moto goes on to state that
quote coffee lake is now completely
working on 100 and 200 series
motherboards so far core i3 8100 has
been tested working completely on the
100 series boards and the user goes on
to credit contributions from various
team members on the project the team
posted a guide on how to do this on the
win raid forum if you're interested
there are four primary steps to the
process of getting coffee like working
on previous boards first you need a UEFI
BIOS update err you need an Intel binary
modification program a V BIOS and BSF
package and the ami UEFI mm tool which
is another software utility the guide
also provides instructions on which
binaries and batch files need to be
modified or changed to allow insertion
of the coffee like micro code to further
allow bootable eighth-generation cpus on
one hundred 200 series boards it's not
guaranteed to work but it's worth a shot
for anyone who has an old board and is
trying to figure out how to make it work
with the new CPUs maybe save some money
a few sites pointed out an Intel oddity
on the graphics bench website this week
it's a CPU named the i7 86 70 which
graphics bench claims to have 12 threads
and 6 cores there's no guarantee that
this is an accurate specifications
listing and it would be sort of out of
character for Intel to create an i7 CPU
with the second digit being a 6 as is
the case with 86 70 parts in the last
few generations with a 6 in that
specific location in the name have been
Core i5 CPUs so we have some indication
that the 86 70 is real but it's not
fully clear on the specs at this time
either way if we assume that any of this
information is correct it looked like
the CPU is at 3.1 gigahertz base clock
with 6 cores and 12 threads likely
selling at a price one would assume
between an 80 600 K and an 80 709 KS CPU
there have also been a lot of slides for
Rison of debated legitimacy over the
past week so this is kind of following
up in the same rumor segment the 86 70
is more or less a rumor and this stuff
is - but there are a lot of slides out
now for
an alleged rise in 2000 series launched
and the newest rumor indicates a thread
Ripper follow-up potentially sooner than
we'd expect aiming at 2018 if the slides
are to be believed and the rumor
indicates that this hypothetical
threader her part would be a part of the
rise in 2000 series architecture and
changes to that architecture one thing
we can say with certainty is that the
major rise in 2000 series announcements
will be happening soon
about a month from now sometime shortly
after PAX East so keep an eye out for
all of that for some quick game news
thats related to hardware if anyone has
forgotten steam is owned by valve and
valve used to be a game developer so
recent news is that Gabe Newell hosted a
discussion at valves offices and was
quoted by PC gamer as saying the
following of its new game quote artifact
is the first of several games that are
going to be coming from us so that's
sort of good news hooray
the house is going to start shipping
games again it's a very jovial from
Newell there interestingly it will also
commented that valve is sort of jealous
of Nintendo for their ability to produce
hardware and software for their games
and this was primarily pointed out as
being worthy of envy because when as
Newell said when my Emoto wants to
design a new game he can look at the
input options and the mechanics options
and then designed the two around each
other which is something that Valve has
wanted to do for a while now rather than
be bound to existing input modes like
mice and keyboards so this goes on to a
further and bigger discussion of their
HTC vive headset which is valve
developed and coincides with previous
statements from valve that they are
working on at least a couple of major VR
titles coming out sometime soon TM maybe
with half-life 3 or one of the other
games that never came out for those
curious artifact appears to be a card
game that's got some vague similarities
to hearthstone and that's the one
they're primarily discussing right now
but Newell did pretty heavily indicate
that valve is attempting to return to
game development in a bigger way this
one's sort of interesting and it might
might please some of you
because it includes the harm of crypto
miners that you've all been very vocal
about The Associated Press ran a story
that a crypto mining company located an
Iceland had 600 computers stolen in a
robbery given that this is coming from
The Associated Press there's not a whole
lot of technical understandings much of
anything as it is more of a mainstream
press outfit so we don't know what the
word computer means in this context we
don't know if that's 600 video cards or
if that's 600 combinations of
motherboard CPU RAM that then had
multiple video cards attached to them
either way the thing that matters is
that the equipment was worth an
estimated two million dollars and was
stolen and rekha Vic in Iceland the
police commissioner locally noted that
the theft appears to be a highly
organised crime and one that occurred or
began in December but they hadn't
disclosed until recently because they
were trying to find the thieves so
another source indicated that the police
are looking at power consumption across
the country to try and identify a likely
source for new mining operation though
tracking fenced sales would be a bit
harder one would assume unless they've
got all the stereo numbers written down
but either way if you're in Iceland and
you recently came across millions of
dollars of components probably don't
hook it up to the grid because they're
looking for you next one NZXT has a new
x 70 to 360 millimeter cooler and a new
120 millimeter cooler from a non asia
tech supplier for once NZXT t's new
coolers coming up are again 360 for the
72 which is part of the X 62 and 52
family and 120 for the m22
whose supplier we haven't yet identified
but it's the same om as for raid max if
you've seen their coolers the X 72 uses
a Sutekh cooling hardware that would be
the generation 5 pump as far as we're
aware which is the same as the X 62 is
presently using and the m22 again will
detail once we know more about it and
just as a bit of a downer we have some
memory pricing news for you at the
beginning of 2018 there were reports
suggesting that meant
prices should start declining sometime
relatively soon in a new report from
digit times prices are speculated to
rise sorry five to ten percent in the
first half of 2018 with increased demand
from data center and smartphone market
segments
additionally Goldman Sachs reinforced
the suspected DRAM price trended a note
to investors and the company also noted
that supply appears to remain
constrained and that 32-gigabyte server
modules being priced at 310 to $315 are
up from about $300 back in January
overall this echo is the most recent
DRAM exchange forecast which expects
DRAM supplies to remain tight with
strong demand as well as expecting to UM
revenue to increase by more than 30
percent in 2018
reaching 96 billion dollars all the big
players that would be Samsung Hynix and
micron are planning on ramping up DRAM
output for 2018 and 2019 with 2017 being
a historic year for DRAM prices and
growth an infusion of new memory supply
to the market could offset the high
prices to an extent but not the high
demand for perspective our writer who
worked on this particular story Eric
Hamilton purchased a g.skill Trident Z
16 gigabyte ddr4 kit 3200 megahertz in
March of 2016
two years ago now for $99 the same kit
today is sold for 211 dollars so a good
investment if you're looking to sell
additionally we did publish a brief
history on Ram prices recently from 2011
to 2018 if you're interested in more
examples of this and the trajectory of
the market we have a content piece for
you on the channel and finally just sort
of a mini review from us we're not sure
what we're planning to do with chairs
but gaming chairs are certainly one of
the more important parts of a set up
it's just hard to cover them if you have
requests let us know what we'll do for
now though as we recently after CES got
a chair from noble in the mail as a
review sample and it's a noble icon
chair I believe it's a $370 chair and
recently not long ago we purchased a
office chair
that was about the same price so what
about comparing the to the icon is not
too dissimilar from a lot of the other
gaming chairs on the market presently
most of the chairs right now use either
the same or a very similar supplier for
things like the arm rests the
4-dimensional they all call it arm
adjustment functionality and the base
and the chair materials aren't too
different either so for an example
verdaguer HyperX corsair thermaltake all
those chairs for the suppliers of the
components I just listed are more or
less the same the noble chair does have
a couple of familiar components on it
just like those do overall its we're a
bit mixed on it so after using it for a
few weeks now certainly the body
position is better for me in terms of
posture than my previous office chair
which was a bit too wide but I would
like to see some of these gaming chairs
start doing slightly more padded if not
fully padded arm rests most of them use
a harder plastic which if you're working
for weight more hours a day then you
should be really starts to feel kind of
bad on your elbows so I'd like to see
that with some of these chairs I'm a mod
it and just add some kind of foam to it
but beyond that the chair itself was
exceptionally easy to assemble which is
something that I absolutely hate with
buying any chairs when they take forever
to build it is the same basic assembly
process as the verdict your chairs we've
had except that has a few more screws
pre-installed once you're using it the
comfort is extremely subjective but it's
better than our office chair we
purchased that I can't recall a name of
and it's really not that different from
the verdict your SL mm tray that we have
so if you like those Nobles kind of in
the same bracket in terms of how it
feels to use it is a vinyl or a fake
leather chair you can get a real leather
version if you're really serious about I
guess racing style seating the pillow
material they selected for it is great
as a foam
it is pretty comfortable actually the
pillow positioning is a bit odd because
the lower pillow doesn't have a means to
lock into place anywhere so you more or
less just kind of like wedge it into the
back of the chair and leave it there and
then every time you get up or sit down
you have to relocate it or just give up
and sit on top of the pillow so that
could be improved but the pillow itself
is actually pretty good compared to some
of the verdaguer ones we've used which
are mostly annoying because of the fake
leather wrap around all of them so yeah
I'm not too sure what we can do with
chair related content it is an important
and extremely important part of the set
up but it's one that we're looking for
your feedback on what do you want to see
if we made a video about gaming chairs
gaming chairs versus perhaps standard
office chairs what would you want to see
in the lineup and what would you like
compared or remarks about between them
as far as the noble chair the icon
overall I certainly prefer it's we'll
call it ergonomics and body position to
my previous chairs it's definitely a bit
better for for the way I mean the way I
sit there forever it's better for my
back I do really want to see cushioned
arm dress so that's big for me and it
seems like no one makes it so I would
say mostly positive with some pretty
major criticisms that apply to basically
all gaming chairs on the market so noble
if you're watching the way to really
stand out from your competitors is be
the only chair company that makes gaming
chairs that chooses a different supplier
and I know that's probably pretty hard
but hopefully you can do it because I'd
like to see someone differ from the rest
of the pack making the same chair so
that's it for this one as always you can
subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow to do a comment let
us know what you want to see for charity
do like one video and that's it so let
me know because I want it to be kind of
a an end-all be-all for us so we can
focus on the other content story i
Kara's axis dotnet to back order one of
our mod mats they will begin shipping
the second round by end of this month or
early April so
pretty soon our first round sold out
basically instantly so backward or now
if you want one thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time
