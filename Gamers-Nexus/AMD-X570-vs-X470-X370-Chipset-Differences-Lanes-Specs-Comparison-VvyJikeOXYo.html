arrival of some technology that was
first deployed on epoch although that
was done through the CPU as there isn't
a traditional chipset with the shift to
PCIe 4x why so many motherboards have
grown more complex than x3 17 x4 70
furthered by difficulties cooling the
higher power consumption ax 570 chipset
all these changes mean that it's time to
compare the differences between X 374 70
and 570 motherboard chipsets hopefully
helping newcomers to rise and understand
the differences along the way before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermal Grizzlies conduct a not liquid
metal conductor not as what we've used
in all of our liquid metal and delayed
thermal tests capable of dropping CPU
thermal significantly and replacing the
stock thermal interface over CPU
thermals don't just allow better
overclocks but also lower noise levels
because the transfer efficiency is
increased the mix of gallium and indium
makes for a thermal conductivity of 73
watts per meter Kelvin outclassing
traditional pastes significantly learn
more at the link in the description
below
this video is only focusing on the
differences in the chipset so that's
gonna be IO it's entirely i/o a little
bit of power consumption but what we're
not talking about is compatibility
between the CPUs and the chipsets or the
motherboards technically you they are
all kind of cross compatible but there's
some caveats there like losing PCIe gen
4 on the older boards and they will be
disabling PCIe 10 for as a toggle in the
new age ISA updates coming up
motherboard manufacturers could
theoretically overcome that if they were
willing to dig through the binary and
figure out which toggle to flip to true
instead of false but that stuff we're
not really gonna get into here
what we're focusing on is i/o and power
will start with power so chips had
average power before we get into IO is
measured at about 11 watts on the XY 70
chipset this is information direct from
and the at their editors tech day board
partners have told us that the peak
chipset power consumption they've seen
is around 14 watts and some board
partners have also told us that they've
seen up to 15 watts which could be an
early alpha version of the chipset but
officially from AMD we've been told 11
watts average and 14 watts peak although
that may change going forward depending
on how and the updates its its firmware
micro code and things like that so at
present the chipset doesn't down clock
during loads
what it does is it sits there burning at
a higher power consumption than the
older chipsets which we're about 5.8
watts and that means you have an active
chipset fan on almost every motherboard
some of them can get away without it
with enough heatsink mass and service
area but most of them will have a fan
because it does burn closer to the 11
watt number constantly X 570 has been
Andy's biggest challenge with rise in
3000 launch it has caused the delay of
the launch at least once as far as we're
aware and the difficulty seemed to stem
from the added complexity and power
consumption requirements of PCIe gen 4
but now that those have been for the
most part conquered other than the
higher power consumption issues the
chipset is shaping up to have a
significant amount more IO capabilities
than the old one so we'll talk about
that next let's get into the specs the
Rison 3000 CPUs have 24 total PCIe lanes
four of those our general purpose or
nvme SSD lanes so you get four by Gen 4
straight to the CPU for SSDs with 16
used for PCIe graphics lanes remaining
four lanes go straight to the chipset
and allow more bandwidth for chipset to
CPU transactions the CPU further
supports four USB 3.0 two connections
and a pic one choice of either one by
for nvme or one by two nvme with two
SATA ports extra the chipset has 20 PCIe
lanes 16 of which are assignable for i/o
motherboard manufacturers have some
limited level of freedom to assign lanes
between devices like PCIe slots SATA USB
high-speed devices or high-speed
networking depending on the goals of the
motherboard eight of X 570s lanes are
always PCIe the other eight can be MUX
down for things like SATA or those other
devices and as a reminder your graphics
lanes typically come straight from the
CPU which has 16 allocated for PCIe 4 in
the actual PCIe slots the x5 70 chipset
also supports 4 USB 2.0 ports 8 USB 3.2
gen 2 ports and two sets of a pic 1
choice of either a single use of 4 PCIe
gen four lanes dual device use on a by 2
configuration of PCIe John for each or 4
SATA 6 gigabits per second lanes this is
going to be where the motherboard
manufacturers make
some decisions on where to allocate
lanes to different slots or ports
finally the chipset natively supports 4
SATA 3 ports which can be increased by
burning one of the pick 1 choices on an
additional for or by using an external
controller although that would reach
levels where you probably don't need
that many here's a chart comparing X 570
versus the previous generation the
biggest change is obviously Gen 4 all
the PCIe lanes on X 570 are Gen 4
whereas that didn't exist on desktop
platforms previously the X 470 and X 370
chipsets were actually the same as each
other but the only real difference being
major up fits to motherboard BIOS by the
manufacturers X 470 motherboards
generally solved a lot of X 3 seventies
and memory issues that were early in the
life of Rison and that was a more
biocide or trace routing than anything X
470 was more of the demarcation of that
BIOS upfit not an actual chipset change
the asterisks in this table indicate
places where numbers could change based
upon the pic one option used by the
manufacturers lanes can be assigned
elsewhere as needed within the
limitations of the x5 70 chipset the
other major change is the move to
support 10 gigabit per second USB 3.0
gen 2 ports up to 8 natively as always
motherboard makers can expand support
for some of these items by adding
third-party controllers on the board but
this is rarely done as cost and
complexity increase and also it starts
to become unnecessary power consumption
is something we discussed earlier in
this video but it's also the last thing
to mention for point of reference if
you're wondering well what is 11 to 14
Watts really mean the x4 70 Knox 370
chipsets we're about 5.8 watts so it's a
pretty significant increase it's enough
of one where most of the board's will
need a small chips at fan or just a
massive heatsink on them
Verizon 3000 the iodine rise in 3000
packages is 12 nanometers the i/o diam X
570 chipset is 14 nanometers and the CPU
dies are seven nanometers this split
allows and the cost savings on dies that
don't show enough gains to justify the 7
nanometre fab cost because we're there
while there can be gains it's not
necessarily actually worth it once the
testing comes out and shows the
differences so that's a clever way for
Andy to save on cost by mixing and
matching the fabrication process and
that'll
if the chipset differences it's really
pretty easy some of our io changes but
mostly PCIe gen3 general purpose lanes
become PCIe John for general purpose
lanes and those can be assigned to all
sorts of things on the board as shown in
some of the diagrams and the the tables
we showed earlier and overall it's a
difference in the capabilities of a
chipset from an i/o standpoint but keep
in mind that your CPU has to support
PCIe gen 4 if you do want to take
advantage of it your motherboard has to
support it of course and in terms of
putting a new CPU in an older socket
don't expect it to work with the
upcoming 2 GC updates from AMD that sort
of the underlying code that gets used in
all the all the firmware so that could
change but the motherboard vendors would
have to dig through binary it's not
presented as source code and that means
that it might be a while before someone
reverse engineers it but we'll see
the biggest thing though is just make
sure that PCIe gen 4 supports arise in
three thousands use for that the AP use
although being de marketed as three
thousand are not using these n2
architecture so keep that in mind as
well if you're buying an APU but that'll
cover us for this one we will talk about
the lower end chipsets as they come out
the B series is not launching for July
7th launch of the news n parts it'll be
coming later we're not sure exactly when
but it will be significantly later from
what the motherboard vendors have told
this but that's venting it's a rumor
land so we'll kind of leave that there
because we don't actually firmly know
