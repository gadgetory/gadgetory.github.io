at CES 2017 continuing our coverage for
now we're focusing on the Vengeance RGB
memory kits they have a lot of stuff
here I'll have an article with
everything in the description below if
you're curious about the peripherals the
chair things like that before we get
into the memory this coverage is brought
to you by cyber power and there's cyber
XL gaming PC which has an invertible
motherboard layout and some other cool
features you can learn more on the link
below
getting to the memory so this is a
continuation of the Corsair Vengeance
line that we saw at Computex but now
they've gone full RGB like everything
else in late 2016 and apparently 2017
these are these single color LED kits
that we have seen previously they come
in red white and blue and the RGB kits
are next to them the difference here
from other RGB kits that we've seen is
that these are controllable through
software so we previously talked about
the HyperX memory that is just coming
out of the predator memory that is also
RGB but that's controllable and
synchronized well through motherboard
software so that relies on gigabyte ACS
and msi in this instance Corsair is
using their own software the corsair
link software it's on it's 4.5 iteration
now it's been out for a while so you go
through the Corsair link software you
can configure the colors the pulse the
nodes all of that stuff as expected the
main thing there that's probably worth
note at least from when I was looking at
it is you can select groups so there's a
drop-down that shows all the different
memory modules that are connected to the
system it works with z2 71 70 X 99 all
that stuff shows the drop-down with the
memory modules and you can go through
and select different modules with a
simple checkbox and set them in a group
so if we wanted to we could configure
one of these in one group one in the
other group and they would have
different lighting modes the forward or
backward whatever functions you want
they don't presently synchronize with
motherboards it is something that's
being looked at that has to be worked
through with the motherboard
manufacturers because this goes through
the sm bus to communicate anything
that's necessary we were asking about
possible links with the existing SP and
HD type products or Corsair already has
RGB LEDs on the market and that's
another one of those maybe being looked
at but not right now because there are
some latency challenges which
makes sense because when you're not
going through USB which would be a lot
easier to do you're limited by other
factors in the system but for now it's
RGB LEDs they're controllable through
software as stated I don't have SKUs I
don't have prices it will probably be
something like 3000 3200 Hertz kits for
the baseline but for anything else we'll
have to come back later so that's coming
out later this year and check the link
in the description below for other
Corsair coverage thank you for watching
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
