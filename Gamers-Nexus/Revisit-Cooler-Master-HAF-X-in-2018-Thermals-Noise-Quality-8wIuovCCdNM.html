feels like an era of computing lived and
died with this case the half X
represented multiple different facets of
computer building that have changed a
lot in the last year for example it's
got large fans not many cases do anymore
230 millimeters in the front 200
millimeters on the side 200 millimeters
on the top partially also representing
why these two hundred-plus millimeter
fans were so difficult to mix and match
with cases because they were not
standardized and the case also had the
all of the plastic embellishments that
you rarely see anymore now the style is
basically steel panels and glass and any
plastic is shunned before that this
video is brought to you by Thermaltake
and the view 71 enclosure the view 71 is
a full tower case that's capable of
fitting three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below so this is
something that we don't see too commonly
anymore but the half X was once the king
of cases and it deserves the title it
was high airflow legitimately it was an
expensive case that came with a lot of
accessories it had USB 3 support in 2010
although you did have threw out a cable
through the case
out the water cooling hole in the back
and into the motherboard but it had
these things and this was a true
flagship case one that I personally
bought and used for several years and I
purchased it about eight years ago it's
been in storage for at least the last
five but today we're revisiting the
coolermaster 1/2 X recapping this case
quickly then it came with a lot of
accessories as stated this is a case
that came from an era where plastic was
not something to be ashamed of having a
computer that resembled a 1980s cartoon
robot was some
I got you sales and at $200 this needed
sales and it got them it was one of the
better selling cases of its time it was
a well known flagship case and part of
that was because of its size you could
fit anything in here for the most part
it has lots of harddrive cages it has
lots of five and a quarter days it's got
large fans that whether or not you know
anything about cases and airflow and
certainly I knew less then than now you
look at those fans and you think that's
a case that can breathe so this had
enough to turn heads and really get
interest in the case industry and that's
why even now you see so much hype around
successors cases that advertise high
airflow the H 500 P for example which
had marketing materials that stated
guaranteed high volume airflow this is
the origin of that it's the genesis of
that case and everything that's coming
after it so the half act certainly was
not without flaw but it was regarded so
highly that we thought what if we look
back at it today what if we reviewed
this case like it launched in 2018 is it
as good now as we thought it was then
and more importantly was it actually
good then have our opinions been
influenced by knowing more about how
thermals work and noise works and all
that so a few features this case comes
with a lot of plastic accessories one of
those is an air duct so you can attach
one of two different air ducts we opted
to use the one on the side panel fan 200
millimeter intake fan that is just
inches away from the GPU and therefore
will probably have insurmountable
cooling performance for the GPU as we'll
discuss in the thermal section so it's
got a cowl on the fan here we rotated it
so that I can hit the GPU clear the
cooler and get some air on the CPU
alternatively you could have placed a
similar air duct up front to direct air
in from the front fan straight on to the
GPU and out of the hard drive cages it
also came with an internal SATA
interface that would allow you to
somewhat hot swap drives out of the
front of the chassis and you plug them
in they mount and
crasher fit against SATA interfaces that
are then using a pass through to go to
the motherboard
this was another accessory feature that
felt high-end fan hubs weren't really a
thing yet so there were no fan hubs in
here power supply shrouds weren't even a
thin yet either so power supply shrouds
are an interesting one
these were popularized around 2013 or
2014 by NZXT with the s340 the original
that's the case that is it's I believe
NZXT is best selling ever case in North
America and the power supply shroud was
popularized then this case came out
years before it but it still had
something of a power supply shroud it
had a plastic trout that was removable
it fitted in the front strictly over the
cables it did not cover the whole power
supply and that was the way they did it
there was no good resolution to the
problem of ugly cables now we just
covered the entire bottom chamber but
back then that was how you did it and
considering that modular power supplies
weren't even all that common at the time
there was more of a price premium and
today it made a lot of sense to go that
route this case also has a couple of
features that are sadly pretty high-end
even today and one of those is hinged
doors internally the case has a couple
of flaws by today's standards one of
those is the lack of any kind of dust
filtration on the bottom of the case
because of the stock configuration what
you have is positive pressure at the
front so you're taking air in through
the front you have exhaust up top you
have exhaust in the back what ends up
happening as we've demonstrated through
testing is that you get a lot of air
drafting in through the bottom and
because we have this on caster wheels
which by the way another really cool
feature we have it on caster wheels so
it's raised up and that means that air
does in fact come in through the bottom
we have no dust filter on the bottom and
I'm pretty sure it did not come with one
either so that is where a lot of your
dust comes in through the case and
because it's got this crenellations on
the top of the case you end up with dust
trapped in all of the small corners
which some of it is still there even
though we did actually try to clean it
off so it's definitely dust friendly
case and
not in a good way but to be fair that
wasn't really as much of a concern as it
is today we had other features than to
drive case sales than dust filtration
steel glass and LEDs the focus was on
other things so an example of limited
dust filtration how does this one come
off the front panel is a great example
of the poorly designed although for then
it was somewhat permissible dust
filtration to get the dust filter out of
this detachable panel you had to bend
these backwards and then you could
separate the two pieces of mesh and one
of the problems with dust filtration on
this case was that it's dust filters
basically we're really fine mesh between
an outside metal grille to witch dust
would stick but a lot of it got through
and an inside honeycomb pattern so
there's a really fine mesh in-between
here something that Coolermaster has
revived for their upcoming age 500p mesh
which uses the original age 500 P front
panel slightly model actually heavily
modified to have mesh and then a backing
finer dust filter so it's that approach
except much harder to clean on the old
half x but also less of a concern for
the time other things here visually it's
interesting it's one of those things it
appeals to a certain type of person
there's kind of a nuclear smoke stack
effect on the top with the two 200
millimeter options and because the fan
takes up the entire Bay there's not
really much wasted space there this top
power button front i/o thing has an
unnecessary sliding cover that doesn't
really do much for you the side panel
for example has a window that really is
sort of almost comical and how useless
it is but this is before the tempered
glass revolution and what else you going
to do there's a 20 millimeter fan here
not a lot you can do there's kind of a
weak LED on the front of the case barely
provides enough light to see anything
the window so it just shows kind of how
the times have changed especially with
visuals and aesthetics but of course
they've somewhat regressed with cooling
performance so radiator support and
liquid cooling support in general were
more or less non-existent but also
wasn't really as much of a thin at this
time liquid coolers mostly sucked or
we're really expensive cable management
is another area where it succeeds
through brute force the left side panel
of the case bows out a bit and that's
enough to jam most the cables into it
has some cable tie points but not a
whole lot of them and it's certainly
lacking in that department another sign
of the times now it's not necessarily
true that the toppdogg case is the one
with the most junk crammed into it this
was once the theme and the half ex was a
flagship case that we bought but the
industry has seriously changed even when
we built in this eight years ago we
removed the drive cage duct to the video
card support and the power supply shroud
although there is photographic evidence
of cold cathode tubes and underglow for
the case we're a bit ahead of the times
on RGB cable tie points aren't tightly
placed in pairs like cases we've
reviewed lately but they exist which was
good enough at the time there's plenty
of room to spread out cables and tie
them down especially with the bulky
stock USB and SATA cables cleared out of
the way getting into thermals half
stands for high airflow and the half ex
certainly is that this is where it
differs from the H 500 P the H 500 P
technically doesn't have half HAF in the
name so it's not necessarily directly a
successor to this product but it had
marketing materials that said guaranteed
high-volume air flow something else
about high airflow in the reviewers
guide and it has - 200 millimeter very
visible fans in the front so this was a
case that even though it wasn't
perfectly a name it was meant to follow
the half x we never used the video card
cowl but we did use a side panel one
rotated 90 degrees so that it would
clear our modern GPU the manual does say
that only one or the other should be
used anyway and we prefer the less bulky
one the CPU averaged fifty point nine
degrees Celsius over ambien
in the torture test with no shroud on
the side panel temperature averaged
forty nine point one degrees Celsius a
difference within margin of error but
one which could also be due to the more
distributed airflow pattern so what you
need to double 200 millimeter top intake
had a more dramatic effect and
temperature lowered to forty five point
nine degrees our CPU cooler is oriented
to move air away from the front of the
case to the back so the top intake fans
didn't point directly into it but they
still provided much more air than is
otherwise sent to the top of the case
removing the front panel had no
significant effect on the CPU
temperature since the only intake fan
that benefits from removing the panel
isn't pointed towards the CPU there's a
large distance between the front panel
and the CPU cooler it's partially
obstructed by an optical drive bay and
the front panel is so well ventilated
anyway that it wouldn't make much of a
difference
comparatively fifty point nine degrees
over the ambient isn't as good as the
red line oh six at forty seven point
eight or the cougar conquer at forty
eight point five but it's still among
the very best results for a stock case
on our chart given how little emphasis
the stock configuration puts on CPU
cooling that's impressive with an
additional fan and the top intake
configuration blowing more air through
the top of the case the half X is forty
five point nine degree results is only
beaten by the silverstone Raven o -
which is from a similar era and lines of
three 180 millimeter air penetrator fans
up with the CPU cooler the stock h 500 p
was nowhere close falling behind at
fifty six point one degrees celsius
delta T over ambient which further
illustrates one of our primary concerns
with the initial marketing materials
that referenced high air volume removing
the front panel of the H 500 P allowed
an average forty three point seven
degree Celsius temperature which is
impressive and it shows the cooling
potential of to unrestricted two hundred
millimeter fans but it's not that much
better than the top intake configuration
of the proper one scan half x moving on
to GPU torture thermals next forty six
point nine degrees over ambient was the
average GPU temperature during the same
test removing the side panel shroud
raised to this to fifty point six
degrees as the airflow was less
concentrated and removing the front
panel again caused practically no change
from baseline the
in take test was slightly warmer than
baseline at forty seven point five but
within margin of error the upper section
of the case is separated from the bottom
by the GU back plate and the top intake
and rear exhaust air cycle doesn't
interact much with the heatsink side of
the GPU and the stock configuration some
incoming air must pass by the GPU to get
to the top rear of the case thanks to
the side intake fan the stock results
for the half X is the coolest GPU
temperature on our chart although within
margin of error and somewhat tying the
red line zero six it does technically
chart top though and for that the half X
holds strong onto its long-held airflow
badge this wasn't properly high airflow
setup and it's largely enabled by the
now rare side panel fan even with the
top intake arrangement intended to
benefit the CPU of the GPU is cooler in
the half X than in any other case
besides the redline zero six the stock h
500 p averaged fifty four point nine
degrees celsius tells it's he over
ambient a difference of eight degrees
this is why we were so disappointed in
the h 500 PS middle in performance even
without the front panel GPU temperature
in the H 500 P average higher than the
half X by a couple degrees and that's
because of the advantage of side intake
something that very few cases have these
days that's not just the new H 500 P
moving on to 3d mark forty six point
nine degrees is easily the lowest
average GPU temperature we've seen in
the firestrike extreme stress test next
bests are the silverstone raven o2 and
PMA one case is neither of which have
side intake fans and remember this is a
test period of thirty minutes so it has
plenty of time to reach study stage the
stock h 500 p averaged fifty eight point
nine degrees celsius delta T over
ambient on the opposite side of the
charge and a full twelve degrees warmer
in its results
Silverstone proves that a side panel
intake isn't necessarily required to
perform well on this test but the half X
shows the incredible efficiency of a
large side panel fan positioned inches
away from the GPO shroud the case was in
stock configuration for 3d mark and
blender tests so CPU cooling in blender
wasn't as good as it could be with the
top intake result we tested previously
rendering on the CPU core temperature
averaged thirty six point six two
three Celsius which is exactly the same
or almost as the PM o1 and cougar concur
and a bit warmer than the Raven o2 and
redline zero six it's still among the
top performers though just as it was in
the torture test
knowing that reconfiguring the top
improves this further shows the
versatility of this well cooled case or
the optional well cold case rendering on
the GPU GPU temperature is again the
lowest we've seen at twenty three point
two degrees versus the PMO one's twenty
three point seven delta T over ambient
this is within margin of error but
impressive nonetheless the H 500 P
average twenty eight point eight degrees
Celsius GPU delta T a difference of five
point six degrees in a test where most
cases fall within a total range of 10
degrees noise isn't nearly as bad as it
could be on a case with for fans and
holes everywhere the forty four point
six decibel Raven O two proves that
forty one point one DBA is definitely
loud but the major advantage of using
only a single fan a smaller than 200
millimeters is that none of them
individually produce much noise the side
cowl helps by concentrating air from a
large and therefore quiet fan into a
small area rather than just using a 120
millimeter fan if the additional fan
mounts on the video card support and
drive cage were filled noise levels
would increase significantly and the
point here isn't to dredge up bad
memories of the age 500 P but just to
show how things have changed and if this
case ever really was as good as we all
thought it was at least as I thought it
was at the time that I bought it for
$200 so the 1/2 X it wasn't the end
point of case design and 2010's
requirements were certainly different
than now innovations have actually
occurred in case manufacturing wouldn't
seem really all that possible to change
cases very much but they've changed a
lot clearly so this isn't really a
discussion of whether you should buy it
now because you shouldn't you should not
go by the 1/2 X for $200 which you can
do new and with even better USB 3
support than this one the original has
but you shouldn't buy it because it's
just changed too much the case has great
cooling configurations compared
modern cases but there are other modern
cases that offer that too not as many
mind you but they do it and they also
offer other modern amenities like a
better power supply shroud if you want
that LEDs and better positions if you
want that better cable management better
ease of installation features and the
half X has support for a gigabyte XL ATX
form factor motherboard when's the last
time you heard of one of those there's
probably 2010 or thereabouts so this is
a case where it's hard to clean even
externally the drive cages can't be
removed the fans aren't all that great
it's so big that it needs wheels if the
case now doesn't make a lot of sense but
again no and by the way basically no
liquid cooling support in a $200 case
but this is a 2010 product so looking
back at it now if the question is was it
really as good as we thought it was I'd
have to say the answer is yes this was a
reasonably well designed case by
Coolermaster its major faults are things
like dust management which is almost
always a side effect of something that
has legitimately decent airflow now
companies have advanced airflow design
since then they've certainly degraded it
as well depending on which one you're
looking at
but for advancements you see things now
like none of this none of these holes
all through the front panel where they
don't need to exist where there's no fan
where it's impossible to clean the dust
filters now now we have better dust
filters we have mesh grilles for the
front that certainly existed here but
they just weren't that cleanable or
maintainable so it certainly improved
but we do think that this case generally
was one of the better options for the
era the excessive three and a half and
five and a quarter bays and the overall
appearance of the case are dated but
they made sense at the time as stated
earlier the 1980s cartoon robot look was
in as was at one point just prior to
this acrylic I believe Linus has a video
coming up showing how he purchased
sorted a bunch of acrylic things for for
radiators at the time so it was clearly
part of the in-crowd although I think he
apologizes for never having sold any but
that's beside the point
point is that this case even now
thermally and to some extent
acoustically is a pretty decent
performer it's a chart-topper it's the
best in several GPU categories so that's
the power of side panel cooling someone
recently asked us what we thought of
side panel cooling there's your answer
if you want the coolest possible GPU
temperatures especially for multi card
configurations for like a render or
workstation box side panel intake we'll
get it for you with the least effort the
lowest fan speeds and therefore the
least noise you can configure the rest
of these fans to be lower rpm and let
the side panel fan blast and you'd be
perfectly fine for thermals and your
noise levels would be even lower than we
measured so it's got decent design
elements and although we wouldn't
recommend it today it was a good
purchase at the time depending on of
course on your style for the externals
but we do hope that the H 500 P mesh
coming up soon will be a proper
successor to this hence the revisit and
given our panelists testing and previous
measure Phi testing of the age 500 P we
think it's possible that it could be a
good thermal performer Coolermaster has
done a lot to address all of our
concerns with the upcoming H 500 P and
even the H 500 M and when I say H 500 P
I do mean the mesh version so they've
addressed most of our concerns as we
showed in our CES coverage and will soon
be covering that case in a full review
we are purchasing the case ourselves
we're getting it through side channels
solely one to two days later than
everyone else but I can assure you it'd
be worth the watch so make sure you
subscribe so you can catch that and as
always go to patreon.com/scishow and
you can go to store dock gamers nexus
dotnet to pick up one of our mod match
we are restocking them very soon and
you'll want to be in that first wave
because we sold out pretty quickly last
time so thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
