and this is our third and final one
we're shooting for this week's series we
have one on the patreon channel if you
go to patreon.com/scishow section below
for next time and for this one we have a
couple of questions about very specific
thermal questions actually on SSDs or
opt in specifically have questions about
liquid metal testing and performance
between cool labs conductor na and
others and then we've got a couple of
others in here as well like a question
about the evolve ATX before that this
video is brought to you by Lian Li is at
LAN Cole one case the land coal one uses
a mix of aluminum and steel to create a
unique front bezel design that still
manages to allow air through at the
artistically cut panel fan mounting
options are everywhere in the case and
ease of installation features that make
the case trivial for building a system
the land coal one is competitively
priced while still being constructed
with high-quality materials and a sturdy
chassis learn more at the link in the
description below it's just before
getting started as always our store has
been recently pretty fully restocked the
full logo shirts are on the store now to
store documents Nexus dotnet for those
and we also have the mod mats available
on backorder keychains are still there
if you're interested in the GM keychains
they're a pretty affordable item and
then we have our video card Anatomy
posters it's actually one of my favorite
things we have right now just because
it's a really cool and useful design so
if you're interested in that stuff it's
on stored I game is next to Scott and
that the glasses will be coming in again
the next couple weeks first question
cazador de Wolfe says why isn't this
color corrected I don't know what you're
talking about
next question metal shark says what is
the ideal temperature range for obtained
memory chips
appreciate and likes it warm 50 to 70
degrees Celsius question mark and the
controllers like it cool but cannot find
much on obtain reportedly the only
difference between the Intel 900p and
480 gig or 480 gigabyte version and the
905 P for 80 gigabyte beyond lights was
a firmware upgrade will this firmware
upgrade
made available to 900p owners if not
does the 905 PL ow firmware upgrades so
that a theoretical 9/10 P offering more
performance due to firmware alone
doesn't obsolete the 905 P and our verb
so this is out of my area of expertise
but I was able to approach Alan mal
Ventana from PC perspective who is in my
opinion the leading SSD reviewer in the
space and asked him because we don't
really follow opt in so Alan's an expert
I asked him got his answer and I'm gonna
read that to you but you can go to PC
Pro com2 check out their review he's
also got an editorial on how 3d
crosspoint chain or a phase change
memory works if you're interested in
more of that so starting off with his
answer here's what he said flash sales
are written more easily at higher
temperatures because the electrons can
more easily pass through the insulating
material resulting in less wear 3d
crosspoint works in a completely
different manner passing current through
a very small 20 nanometer phase change
material quickly heating it to 300
degrees Celsius to 650 degrees Celsius
the temperature changes are so rapid and
on such a microscopic scale that the
temperature of the rest of the dye is
mostly irrelevant we can then fall back
to the general solid state component
guidance that cooler temperatures result
in lower failure rates it's also worth
noting that opt in SSD operating
temperatures are rated for 0 to 70
degrees Celsius while NAND based
products from Intel are rated at 0 to 55
degrees Celsius so it appears that opt
in parts care less about temperature
within reason limiting the NAND parts to
a lower maximum is likely to meet the
end-of-life data retention spec of three
months per jeddak enterprise specs
higher temperatures equal greater
leakage and voltage shift of sort data
generally speaking electronic failures
are complicated with multiple mechanisms
at play you have some parts that fall
closer to the 10 degrees Celsius equals
1/2 rule every 10 C increased doubles
the failure rate and you have other
parts like flash memory cells that do
the opposite since the right mechanic
involves injecting electrons through an
insulator where you would want to be at
those higher temps to help reduce
breakdown of the insulator data stored
in 3d crosspoint
Sall should be relatively immune to
temperature until you approach the
temperature is required to erase the
stored data greater than 300 degrees
Celsius I wrote an article covering how
all that works lots of eye candy for
b-roll as well and you can check that
article out will link it below but it's
on PC / comm and it's one of Alan's
editorials and hopefully we can show
some of the butyl he's talking about
while I'm talking about that otherwise
check out the article Thank You Alan
very much for contributing by the way
next question is from Daniel Imboden who
says two questions do you compare have
you compared different liquid metals is
it normal for soldered CPUs to lose
thermal conductivity over time and what
is the problem I deleted an old e 8500
and and applied liquid metal which got
much better OC results but why so for
the first question have we compared them
yes we have we've compared thermal
courtesy conductor not with two of the
cool lab solutions I think it's ultra
and pro are the two most prevalent so we
compared those this is a while ago it is
not something that we've published but
it's something that we did just for
internal testing and internal purposes
so tested - cool lab solutions conduct a
nought and there was one other one I
can't remember the name of but we tested
one other liquid metal as well and the
three brands and four total solutions
were all within one ish degree Celsius I
think the maximum difference the max
delta was about two degrees and here's
the problem our tolerance for error is
minimally one degree so we could not
detect any meaningful difference and for
the most part in terms of thermals
they looked about the same now the theta
with liquid metal with any paste or
compound or anything is that the aging
characteristics are really important and
hard to account for in this type of
testing so what we don't know what we
did not test is how do the other
solutions so conduct a naught versus
cool Labs versus that third brand I
can't recall how do they aged over a
year of use what is the percentage of
gallium in each one for example so we
have a video that should have gone live
by now about actually what happens to
materials when you use different
compounds on them so we've got a video
on that but what we don't know is for
each mixture they're all some form of
gallon stand for the most part so it's
going to be gallium indium and tin but
how much gallium is there in each one
typically it's about two-thirds the
exact percentage fluctuates between
brands so there could be some impacts
performance there if you have more
gallium like the two-thirds number it'll
be a bit more friendly with friendlier
with the copper yhs --is that are not
nickel plated and migration is less of a
concern electron migratory on migration
which can cause this sort of plating
effect but you don't get much corrosion
much pitting it's kind of service-level
pitting doesn't really impact
performance but the point is the
different mixtures of gallons down the
different percentage of gallium indium
and tin will impact the longevity how
frequently you need to replace stuff if
it caused any damage but for the most
part all of these are pretty close
they're really not that different just
like most other things in the hardware
industry so I have not done longevity
testing on all of them just on
conducting out for now but to answer
your question the thermal difference
just tendeth applied and then tested
within a day is effectively zero there
was effectively no difference now does
that change over time I can't answer
that right now it's not something we've
tested but I can give you the that is
there any difference immediately and the
answer is no and as for your other
question removing solder and replacing
it with liquid metal should not really
improve stuff for you so I don't know
enough about the e 8500 I didn't work
with it I don't I don't know anything
about its interface it's thrown liner
face material so I would think that no
that shouldn't happen but I don't know
why that did with your case maybe maybe
I had micro fractures or something next
one ZX z AK says as a newcomer to your
channel though I've known of you in the
tech space for years how would you sell
your channel to a new viewer I'm
subscribed and looking forward to future
content but how much of your library of
content is worth of you
I don't mean to sound elitist or
pretentious but rather that with the way
tech changes and evolves
I wouldn't necessarily need to watch
benchmark videos for all the cards I
definitely get what you're saying and I
completely agree with you it's something
that we we it's kind of interesting so a
bit of a side note but running the site
for ten years what I've learned is that
I kind of figured out like figured out a
lot of those problems early on like the
one you're talking about and then you
sort of forget that you figured it out
and you rediscover it again when a
viewer brings it up like you just did so
to answer your question there is
definitely still content that's worth
viewing and I'm not gonna pitch it to
you because it's not a marketing person
but I'll give you a few examples factory
tours if you search the channel for
factory tour they should pretty much all
come up those are interesting they don't
really age because the same idea it's I
mean maybe they're making older stuff
but the tools don't change so factory
tours would be very interesting pieces
that you might like feature pieces are
good that can teach you a lot about
hardware so in my mind when when we when
we brand something as a feature piece it
is basically a very targeted test so
rather than a full review a feature
piece might be when we did Vega 56 and
we brought the power limit up to 240
percent or whatever insane number it was
so that was a fun one when we did Titan
V testing we did Titan V scalability
with two to Titan V's versus one and the
one application that supported it we did
Titan the clock scalability we've done
Vega 56 versus 64 clock scalability
we've done BIOS flashing so anything
that's kind of a feature where the data
in a year from now when no one's buying
the card that we worked on in that piece
the data is not applicable to your
purchasing decisions anymore but the
interaction of how Hardware behaves is
applicable and will still matter
so that's another what was another good
one we did we did a lot of stuff with
frontier Edition so here's a good one we
did Vega frontier edition clock matched
with PG with the fury X so clock for
clock what's the performance Delta
because otherwise the
they're not too different on the surface
of things and so that's really
interesting one because you can see
architecture scalability and it changes
over time as drivers mature but the the
underlying idea is we can look at cards
in this instance by clock matching them
and start to better understand how much
of this performance improvement is from
architecture versus how much of it is
just from driving the clocks up with ton
and so that's really interesting content
the reviews I agree with you you don't
you don't need to go back and watch our
ZOTAC 1080 TI review if you're not
buying it I mean like the thermal
sections may be a little interesting but
is it teaching you something that will
be helpful maybe for the most part
though you just kind of wait for the one
that is relevant to the thing you're
buying and watch that instead so I agree
with you those aren't necessarily worth
watching
but the factory tourists feature pieces
we had a series we work on TL DR that
we've kind of done away with the name of
but those videos are interesting they
talk about how stuff works so we talked
about like how air coolers work and we
have custom 3d animations in them that's
really cool how NAND works is a good
video we did one on how liquid coolers
work that's a really good video with
custom animations that we made in-house
lots of stuff like that and I there's
more - but but that's kind of that's
that's what I've got in my head right
now but yeah hardware news and reviews
probably out the most interesting our
disappointment build was really fun
though and then like the sort of seminal
reviews like the H 500 P but it's like a
classic so you got to watch those
definitely watch the classics but yeah I
don't know I like the question I'll
think more about how we can maybe
categorize our content to split aside
stuff that's like hey I'm new here but I
don't want to dig through a bunch of
reviews and news that's a year old what
can i watch so well we'll try and figure
something that maybe did playlists the
feature pieces or something
next one Maj so sbk says hi can you
please explain how is really how related
how our SOC voltage and ram speed and
voltage related and rephrase your
question of it so mister sbk let's get
into this one you can think
src voltage and si or system agent
voltage to memory as CPU voltage is to
clocks so it's it's kind of a microcosm
of what you're doing on the CPU side
with V core and a CPU frequency same
idea we're with it driving a higher
frequency on the memory let's just
assume there there are a lot of factors
at play here so let me outline those to
drive a high frequency you need a good
die on the memory so that Samsung or
high next or whatever you a good die in
the memory that's number one so you kind
of been in a bit there
number two you need a good IMC or
integrated memory controller on the CPU
that's really important you can have
memory that's rated for forty six
hundred megahertz and we do but if
you're IMC just can't go above 3600
there's nothing you can do and then you
also need a board that can support it
and a couple of other things but those
are the two major ones it's the I am see
quality and it's the die of the silicon
quality on the memory and then you also
do have a concern of the CPU core itself
so now you're you're trying to get a CPU
that has both a strong core because you
obviously want to overclock the core
pretty high if you're already into
memory overclocking and it has a strong
IMC so it's asking a whole lot once you
get into memory as for SOC voltage V SOC
and VSA a VCCS a system agent voltage on
Intel what you're looking at there is a
way to help stabilize when you have
memory failures so if you're starting to
overclock your memory let's say you go
to maybe 4,000 Duggers it's pretty good
one so your system might be able to
sustain 3600 with no changes and you got
kind of a have kind of a black hole in
between there at 4000 megahertz you
might need some more voltage and pushing
DRAM voltage is fine that'll certainly
get you a lot of the way there it's a
relatively safe thing to do up to an
extent anyway but at some point the imc
the integrated memory controller on the
cpu so it's it's within the die of the
cpu on the same substrate and the same
guy that IMC is going to have trouble
keeping up and will need assistance via
voltage to do so so you're pushing
voltage for the memory to
the memory clocks up and then at some
point if that's not good enough anymore
you have to push voltage to the system
agent or SOC so that the CPU can drive
its IMC in a way that will support the
memory overclock so hopefully that helps
quick note here be really careful when
messing with sa IO and SOC voltages they
are the easiest way to degrade IMC
quality if you aren't careful if you
don't know what you're doing and I'm not
gonna go through all the numbers for all
the different architectures but for
modern architectures like let's say
desktop parts you definitely definitely
want to be below 1 point 4 volts on
Intel and AMD for SI or SOC for SOC you
want to be closer to 1.2 on anthe
processors I think officially rise in
2000 I think officially it is 1.3 as a
safety now but I'm not positive I
haven't checked in a while when Rison
one originally launched it was
recommended to stay at 1.2 volts for V
SOC and I think it's 1.3 now but double
checked me because I don't keep it on my
head but it's in our content out there
somewhere and then si you're looking at
closer like 1.2 1.3 and if you really
don't care about the quality and you're
just benchmarking for a short time and
you need it you new 1.4 we've done it
but if you run it that way for long
enough you will degrade the IMC quality
and lose the ability to maintain high
frequencies at low voltages so be very
careful about that and don't just take
the numbers I said here as as gospel for
anything because changes for every
architecture and I don't keep 100% of it
in my head go research on overclocking
forums and stuff like that too next one
RR says curious about your software
setup for your test benches specifically
your Windows setup which settings have
you changed to minimize variants in your
results how frequently do you allow
Windows 10 to update I ask because it's
may be useful info for anyone trying to
optimize their own systems so we we
disable Windows Update but we'll update
Windows manually for really for like
milestones we disable Windows Update
because it's important for us to know if
it updates because I've seen it
seeing systems turn on when I'm just
like I'm facing the other way the
system's been off for two days
and I just hear it spin up like there's
a ghost in the room you turn around and
windows updates itself so that's a big
problem because yes we want to keep
windows up-to-date within reason we
don't need every small security patch I
should say small security patch as in
like not spectrum out down will grab
those but if it's just like a small some
kind of small update maybe they add more
USB device support or more nic support
or something like that who cares don't
hate it it just messes us up but we need
to know when it updates and for what
reasons so we manually control it so we
disable Windows Update you can do it
through the services tab if you don't
like it and like just now we just
rebuilt all of our test benches for CPU
and GPU with the move because we're
doing all new content retesting
everything so now is a good time where
we just update it we install fresh
windows OS we update it to the newest
version and then we disable update lock
it there complete the tests for this
content and once this content is done we
can either decide to update that os keep
it or blow it all away and do a new
image depending on kind of the quality
of the integrity of the image if it's
had any if it's gotten messy or degraded
from all the drive around resolves
reinstalls it's important for us to
monitor that stuff but basically it
answer your question when we are working
on a single content piece we disable all
updates so that we don't end up in a
scenario where we have half the test
data with one version of Windows and
then it updates without us knowing
overnight or something and then half the
test data with a different version of
Windows because then that interferes
with the quality of the data so yep
that's that's all we do it's all manual
next one Vernon says we're removing
portions on the top and bottom of the
shroud on a GPU to help with cooling it
when the heatsink fins are oriented from
motherboard to case a side panel that is
by giving warmer air and a easier exit
route so this is actually a great point
and that if you ever want to know which
way a video card exhausts you can kind
of grab the card and this is not the
best example because the circuit
heatsink but you can look down and look
at the fins and see how they're oriented
and if they run this way so it's long
ways that way with gaps in between then
it's the air when it pushes down through
an axial fan not a radial fan pushes
down from an axial fan the air will
follow the channels so it's gonna go in
that example it'll go towards the front
will go towards the back
not a ton through the top if it's
oriented up and down like this user is
suggesting it'll go up and down so to
answer your question yes removing a if
the shroud is really covering it that's
poor design but removing it would
certainly help with ensuring that the
air gets out where it needs to get out
and it's stuff we've done in the past
but not for a while huh this sets pretty
cool so yeah if you modify the shroud so
that the air can actually is follow the
channels and escape like out towards the
case panel then it it'll help a bit it's
just how much you'd have to test it if
they fully a clue or obstruct the the
fins at the edge then that's just bad
design and yet you should modify it but
if it's just kind of like a nameplate
and it's taking like a couple
millimeters of depth and it's a couple
inches long it's not really gonna change
anything you're just mutilating your
card for not a whole lot of gain so it
depends on how much it includes that the
finned exit next one Nura says what
happens if you use two sticks of RAM
with different amounts of storage on it
Congrats on 300,000 thank very much so
two different two different capacities
it'll it'll mess up the timings probably
if they're different timings as well so
you'll end up with additive capacity so
you have eight and four it'll be twelve
but which is not exciting but if the
eight has like see all 15 times and the
four as you know something else 14 16
then you might want to go in there and
manually tweak the times to make sure
they're all roughly the same because
otherwise you can start encountering
just blue screens corruption and stuff
like that it's it's a good idea to keep
the memory times as close as possible
next to our last one Angie Agnes in says
if you reviewed a case that made an EVGA
FTW GPU hit 90 degrees would you call it
a perfect case you've ever tested in
response I didn't watch the hardware
connects video I can't comment on it
I'm sorry so I'm not going to comment
and can't comment on on whatever they
did because I haven't seen it but I will
answer the question though of will you
be reviewing that if antics evolve X our
plan is to yes review it but we have to
buy it and I don't think it's available
for consumers yet and by the time I
heard that it was up for pre-order all
the pre-orders hold out and although we
tell you not to preorder hardware in
this instance it makes sense for us to
preorder it so that we can tell you if
you should buy it or not but I didn't
get in on time so we're gonna keep an
eye out if any of you out there bought
the Evolve X and you're okay with
parting with it for about a week let us
know you can tweet at us that's probably
easiest way at gamers Nexus let us know
if you want to loan it out once it comes
in otherwise we will be buying on as
soon as they are available and testing
it reviewing it we tried to meet up with
fantex at Computex this year and last
year and a fan maybe CES one year
contacts last two years though and
fantex was unable to accommodate a
meeting with us they didn't want to they
weren't able to find time to talk to us
I guess so they didn't send us one but
that's fine I'll buy one and we'll see
how it does it's not sure when so keep
your eyes open for that subscribers
