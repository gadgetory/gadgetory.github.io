new doom iteration and this is running
on the Vulcan api with a gtx 1080 so
this is the sort of interesting part
about the demo otherwise it's just
gameplay of doom which is of course a
good looking game but mostly interested
in the API in the GPU so for a bit of
backstory this demo was first given to
us in Austin Texas during the GTX 1080
unveil in a closed doors press event and
in that demonstration as we published on
the website this particular demo that
you're looking at right now was running
at a range of 120 fps to 200 FPS maximum
and then we were also told by developers
in software that the FPS it's actually
capable of going higher than 200 but to
do to a game timing bug which will be
resolved by launch they were capping the
FPS to 200 so this has a range of 122
200 the video itself is rendered of
course at 60fps and what you're looking
at is 1080p ultra gaming with doom on
the vulcan api to Vulcan is a new
low-level API it's sort of similar in
some ways to Direct X 12 and that it
grants low-level access to the hardware
and developers or game engine developers
in most cases will be able to manually
tap into things like memory and
registers and make all those calls to
better accelerate the graphics
processing and that's what helps out
here with reducing load on the cpu and
things like that so this is on Vulcan
the Vulcan patch won't be available on
game launch you won't be able to play
with Vulcan on day one but the proper
Vulcan update will come within I think
we were told a few weeks of launch if
not sooner so you can expect it pretty
immediately and we will be trying to
benchmark that assuming computex doesn't
interfere too much in terms of the
graphics that you're looking at most of
the things worth pointing out here are
you can see some decals all these blood
decals everywhere that's just normal
sort of two-dimensional images arrays
that are painted onto the surface as
decals that will likely eventually
disappear but the more interesting
effects are all these particle effects
and there's a lot of lighting and
shading stuff going on some volumetric
effects that you can
in here that gun that was just being
shot looks I can't really tell from this
short clip but it looks like it's just
almost shooting a sprite the explosives
that are pretty damn cool and the
gameplay looks quick I mean it reminds
me of the old quake or UT games
certainly old old doom games but I
haven't played those in ages those look
pretty interesting though graphically
you're looking at some medium geometric
complexity nothing too crazy going on
low to medium geometric complexity with
a lot of particle effects and shaders
and lighting for the post-processing
things like that to really drive the
graphics to a different level other than
this I think there is if i'm not
mistaken physically based rendering
within doom that's a pretty big thing
now where you can actually watch our
interview with Crytek about PBR
physically based rendering and learn
what that is and how it works interacts
with the world interact with GPU on the
GPU and cpu side of things vulcan does
mean that a lot of the draw calls will
be moved away from the cpu and on to the
GPU and so a draw a call if you're not
familiar with one is basically a term
representing the process or the act of a
cpu telling a GPU individually to draw a
triangle and if you have complex
geometry all these polygons and things
we have complex geometry the CPU is
going to making a lot of command issuing
a ton of commands to the GPU to draw
these triangles that's very inefficient
and that's how it works with directx 11
there's really no way around it with a
Vulcan and with DirectX 12 the API is
able to bypass a lot of the overhead
that's present in directx 11 and so
these draw calls suddenly can just sort
of be moved off of the CPU and handled
entirely by the GPU that reduces a lot
of the workload which means that in
instances where CPU might start choking
on the render thread or some other
thread maybe the physics thread whatever
where the CPU might start choking on one
of these threads it is able to push that
over to the GPU and you end up with
these really high fidelity high frame
rate graphics that we get
now in the doom demonstration presented
by its author and this is brand new
gameplay footage by the way unedited by
our team other than the voice-over so
pretty interesting stuff draw calls have
it's just one part of the advantage of
DX 12 and Vulcan generally memory
management's is another major item
depending on how these Engine developers
take advantage of the new API s and a
lot of this is going to be on the end
inside that's one of the more
interesting things here is that from an
industry standpoint it is it's really
hard to properly build for Vulcan and
dx12 it's not just like a free
performance game that you get by sort of
plugging in an API and this is why if
you've seen some of the benchmarks with
maybe rise of the Tomb Raider this is
why you'll see Direct X 12 sometimes
perform worse than directx 11 even
though in theory it should perform
better in almost every scenario and the
reason is mostly because developers will
either not build from the ground up for
the new API which means it's not taking
advantage of every aspect that does net
these gains or they are wrapping the
game so that it's just calling the x12
but it's not really instituting it at a
low level and reaping those benefits and
so when you wrap a game just like
wrapping anything else and software all
it's doing is actually creating an
additional overhead and hence you'll see
maybe a 1 or 2 FPS slow down with the X
12 / 11 so I believe that wraps up our
doom at demo it's about six minutes here
pretty good looking game I have not
played it so I'm not going to comment on
the gameplay but certainly looks good
Vulcans a big deal but as always thank
you for watching if you have questions
about this stuff post them below maybe
we'll address it in an ask GN otherwise
or gt x 1080 review is coming up very
shortly so do you subscribe for that
patreon like the petrol video if you
want help us out directly i'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
