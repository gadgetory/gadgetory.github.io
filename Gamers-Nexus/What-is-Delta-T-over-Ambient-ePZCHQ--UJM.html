1% losing 0.1% Louis for frame rates and
frame time testing and methodology
accuracy things like that and part of
presentation of data when we do these
benchmarks on GPUs or cases or CPUs is
talking about delta T over ambient
temperatures so that's a pretty critical
point that I wanted to make a separate
video explaining because it doesn't seem
like it's necessarily universally
understood so here's the thing with case
testing test something like this versus
an H 440 or whatever whatever the fantex
one is that I hated on when you're doing
case testing and you're looking at
temperature values just pulling an
actual measurement from straight from
the CPU or straight from the GPU without
accounting for the ambient temperature
or the environment temperature of the
house or test area there could be
variants in that ambient temperature
that makes the one to two degree
differences and a lot of instances
basically gone or you can even have
cases trade spots when they shouldn't
just because you haven't accounted for
ambient so let's talk about that the
ambient temperature of this room I'm in
right now is probably somewhere in the
range of 68 to 72 Fahrenheit depending
on whatever the thermostat set to but it
also depends on things like how hot that
wall is from the Sun if we're doing
something during the day or where the
vents are located in the ceiling and so
when you have these different variables
doing one case test one day to the next
there can actually be a very large
change so as an example many years ago
when I first did case reviews him before
taking about a year break between them I
had a case like this I ran a test on it
one day it was X degrees and then the
next day it was X degrees plus two ended
today after that it was X degrees minus
2 or 1 or whatever and so there's this
big range of a couple degrees so to get
rid of that we came up with this
solution that I talked about in our
thermal test chamber video so we
validated our methodology using a
thermal chamber and proved that it was
basically a hundred percent reliable and
you can find that video in the end slate
I suppose or the description below but
we use one of these this is a
thermocouple reader this is a k-type
thermocouple it can withstand a serious
amount of heat
I think 800 degrees Celsius or something
and we run it actively and I just I keep
one of these measuring ambient and if we
want extra validation I'll put another
one on and measure somewhere else in the
case like the intake or the exhaust or
whatever in front of the CPU fan but the
one measuring ambient right now says
it's 23 degrees Celsius twenty two point
eight degrees Celsius twenty three point
one so a bit of a fluctuation there I
logged that value actively every second
and we logged the CPU diode every second
the GP diode every second PCH whatever
and then take this data put it in a
spreadsheet in one column take this data
for say the CPU put it in another column
and then you subtract this from the CPU
temperature that gives you what we call
a delta T value or the temperature
difference when subtracting ambient and
so now let's say I take this case and I
test it against what something not NZXT
that we liked the 400 C or the 600 C so
we take this case have a 600 C here run
them both through the bench and I
subtract the data from test one from
this out of this case and test two from
this out of that case now we have
basically perfectly comparable results
accounting for and again this is still
fluctuating it's at 21.5 now accounting
for that fluctuation in ambient and that
fluctuation can be big just as an
example of some instances where you will
see a change in ambient positioning this
case here versus where the camera is
there would be a difference in
performance so this eliminates the issue
of needing to be a hundred percent of
the time in the same exact spot it also
eliminates the concern of is AC on is
heating on or is neither on and then
there's further concern there if your
heating and air if your HVAC system is
toggle II not an author of the task is
trying to sustain one temperature that
will change the results too so there's a
ton of variables another one opening the
door and walking into the room and
walking out of the room
if it's enough of a gust it will change
the temperature by a couple tenths of a
degree maximally if you have more people
in the room it gets hotter if you're
running multiple systems doing multiple
tests it gets hotter if it's winter or
summer hotter colder type of thing so
it's very important to do this ambient
subtraction and create a delta value and
if you're looking at results that don't
do this or don't account for this
somehow there could be a couple degree
variants and data which often times and
the instance of a case or a GPU cooler
between vendors EVGA versus MSI or a CPU
cooler often times they're fighting over
one degree max because thermal is hard
and we've kind of gone a long way with
it and there's not a lot of room to go
further without increasing the cost
substantially for these cooling units so
when you're fighting over a single
degree it's important to make sure we're
illustrating who wins that one point
because even though it's mostly
irrelevant for everyday use it's still
differentiating sort of a superiority of
design for a specific use case now there
are instances where several degrees will
differentiate cases so for example by
the point of this thing going live
probably our origin Kronos system build
review will go live and in that mini ITX
system we saw the GPU with a 55% GPU vrm
fan speed at fluorine 55% of the speed
we saw that hitting something like 90
Celsius for the actual total temperature
or that would be in the 70s for the
Delta and then you might see another
Mini ITX like the NZXT Manta bit bigger
but hitting something like in the 80s
that's a big different that's a 10
degree difference and that impacts
things in the form of frequency over
time so if you look at a frequency over
time chart as the case gets hotter and
sort of equalizes at whatever
temperature it's going to equalize that
the frequency might start at 2 gigahertz
but fall to 1.6 gigahertz and that
impacts your frame rate pretty massively
so that's an instance where there are
real temperature differences 10 degrees
plus in some cases but most the time it
is about one degree
we do this delta-t subtraction so when I
talk about a GPU running at 0.45 Celsius
idle which I think one of our
liquid-cooled GP is ran away with arts
for a tea I was around one degree
Celsius idle when I say that I don't
mean that it's near freezing that's not
what we're saying because it is not
possible for your GPU your CP it's not
possible for any of these components to
be less than ambient because the air
you're pulling into the system is gonna
be 70 degrees Fahrenheit or 20 21
degrees Celsius that air just by going
through a fan doesn't get colder than it
was when it went in it might accelerate
it and that certainly helps things
dissipates the heat faster through the
fins but it's not gonna be colder than
ambien so when I say a temperature idle
is 1 degree Celsius
what we actually mean in real terms
without the Delta values is it's 1
degree plus the ambient temperature so
it's effectively an offset so Bamian was
20 then that means we'd read the GPU as
21 Celsius so that's kind of that's what
that means now the next thing is our
ambient temperature is way different
from yours potentially there's a big
range so folks who are located in dry
vs. humid areas or in a desert
that's hot versus in somewhere colder
that's going to impact your ambient as
well so what you should do with these
numbers is when you see us reporting
something like a 7 degree 70 degrees
Celsius GPU load temperatures so 7 0
Celsius you go to your own thermostat
you look at the temperature that it is
in the house and convert that to Celsius
and then add that to the value so let's
say that your house is 30 degrees
Celsius because you're in a hot climate
30 plus 70 that's 100 degrees that's a
big deal so that means that your GP is
probably past or hitting teeth the
t.j.maxx and it's throttling down to
control the the frequencies that it can
lower its temperatures that's where
something like that would really matter
maybe you're in a 20 degree ambient
environment 70 plus 20 is 90 you have
much less of an issue than
person at 100 degrees still an issue but
a lot less a lot lower magnitude we'll
say so that's why these things matter
because if we just tell you the
definitive temperature I'll call it to
avoid using the word absolute and
offending somebody if we use the
definitive temperature pre Delta
subtraction one the case will change in
temperature or the GP whatever the
products will change in temperature from
test to test because fluctuations in
ambient and - it will be different than
your own ambient temperature when you
add that back in so that's why we do
that and that's really I think that's
all I have here for notes as well so if
there's a lot of reasons to do this
there's a lot of variables things like
sound testing which is why I have this
here sounds house and you can't do the
same subtraction we'll talk about that
in the future
but if I record something at 60 decibels
which is about what I'm talking about
right now 60 70 decibels they record -
70 decibels for product a and then 70
decibels for product B we still have to
subtract the noise floor which we
measure before every test and then that
subtraction is not just for example say
let's say the noise floor is 25 dB you
can't do 75 minus 25 equals 50 decibels
that's not how how noise work it's it's
logarithmic so we'll explain that in the
future but still the same kind of idea
of presenting a Delta value where we
subtract out whatever the ambient
environment noise or temperature is to
produce a result that you can use so
there's a bit of work on your end but
it's really not that much if you want to
make it easy at 20 Celsius to every
temperature value and you'll basically
see these sort of definitive value with
a 70 ish fahrenheit house but otherwise
it's all comparative so you can see
comparatively which product is better
than the other one if there's a big
difference then you know which one's
superior if there's a little difference
you know that because of our testing
methodology the difference is accurate
and what we would call measurable but
imperceptible which has a very specific
meaning it means that we can accurately
measure and we feel confident that is
outside of any margin of error but it is
not something you would perceive as a
user to be impactful to your experience
so that's what that means when I say
that but hopefully that explains delta T
over a means if you want to learn more
about our testing methodology in the
post roll video there will be two that
are interesting to you one the thermal
chamber video where I put a case in a
thermal chamber and validate this and
show that it works and two the 1% lows
and 0.1% low FPS video which explains
what those two things mean so as always
pay traveling the postural video if you
want to helps out directly by funding
future efforts but as always just
subscribe to get more content I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
