Nexus net and today we're looking at the
Logitech G Series drivers for for the
mouse and keyboard and other G Series
products so this is the accompaniment
the video accompaniment to our G 600
that's what you see here the G 600
review which is published and linked
below in the description of this video
click on that link to read the full
review of the G 600 but this is a so
this is the mouse you have 12 buttons
here on the on the left side thumb side
and it's just four by three and then you
have the normal left right and middle
mouse buttons of course the the middle
one can scroll or press you can lean
left and right with it which is good for
tilting or leaning in a game like Call
of Duty there are two different
elevation buttons right here and then
there's a what they call a G shift
button for your ring finger and
personally I think this one is pretty
cool you hold it down and it gives you a
different set of key bindings for all
the buttons on the mouse so if I hold it
down it'll change what all of these
things do to a different set if I
release it it goes back to the default
set pretty cool in total there's
something I don't know something like 20
buttons it's pretty insane so you can
store these profiles either locally on
the mouse or on the system that you're
on storing it on the mouse is pretty
cool because if you take it to a land
party where you're using a different
machine as long as they have the
software on there or you're allowed to
load it you can load up that profile and
just go it's that easy with this you
just store it straight to the machine so
that's what I will do here's the actual
this is what we're looking at here for
bindings I've already programmed a
couple of these as you can see I've
programmed an alternate toolbar break
free finisher move and this is a profile
I'm building for rift so the mouse does
ship with a couple pre-built profiles I
was not happy at all with one the chips
for rift so I am building a custom one
let me just
unassign these so I can do the demo for
you and basically it's very simple oops
the way it works is you click on the
button you can do edit you see here we
have all of our options you can do it
keystroke which is just anything like
shift why for example multi key a
textblock which is good because if
you're trying to spam guild recruitment
text and chat you can basically type
like hey join our guild blah blah blah
and hit the button on the mouse and it
will spam that and everyone will hate
you but you won't have to type it so
good for you I guess Mouse functions
these are normal functions on pretty
much any Mouse except there are dpi up
down and shift buttons so that's pretty
useful if you change dpi a lot the media
center command here are for Windows
Media Player or your other default media
players hitting a button with this bound
to it will execute the command even if
you have rift or other games open so for
example you can play or skip songs that
are already loaded in Media Player
hotkeys these are normal Windows things
cut paste stuff like that shortcuts just
for launching applications very simple
functions more Windows stuff calculator
is kind of cool but totally not
necessary and Ventrilo of course for
voice-over-ip needs and you can mute and
unmute microphone or sound while
fullscreen by hitting a button so that's
kind of cool you don't have to minimize
to do that and what we are going to do
though is a basic keystroke we will
start with so first of all the goal here
is to use something that you're not
going to be able to hit easily with your
keyboard like shift left bracket that's
just so far out of the way I'm never
going to hit it and it gives me an extra
key that I can that wasn't already being
used in rift or other mmo's so that's
pretty useful there because it does give
you more options if you want to have
like three toolbars on your screen
simultaneously and you were running out
of reachable keys on the keyboard you
can now bind unreachable keys or macros
I show or whatever you want to call them
combinations to the mouse so we will
call this alternate alternative toolbar
one and basically this will be for my
second toolbar on the screen I already
have one toolbar that uses one through
equals and then I will have a second
toolbar that uses these buttons so I
don't need this
which toolbars which of course increases
user input latency and decreases your
competitive advantage in PvP so now
let's do a basically what I just did is
bind this to shift bracket so I can
press that and execute a command on a
toolbar the next thing I'm going to do
is create a simple macro so we will call
this a combat finisher how about that
and this is what I will use on my
assassin class when I'm trying to
execute a series of abilities and rapid
in succession without the potential for
me screwing it up by hitting the wrong
button and you can record delays if you
want to but I will have a lawn a lawn
macro set or a long ability execution
timer on the game so that these will
just queue sequentially and then execute
as each one finishes so let's record
this we'll just say it's 1 2 3 4 5 and
then for sake of example Shift + left
bracket and stop recording so now if I
hit the front middle button this one
here it will execute all those in
succession and then sequentially
sequentially use the abilities in the
game pretty simple you can tell it to
repeat if you want to while pressed
it'll just keep repeating over and over
or tell it to toggle like if you're
doing a Crouch toggle so that's how that
works
and the rest are all fairly simple
really you can bind to actual abilities
like break free I've done here but
that's all you need to see there G shift
that's that rein finger button if I hold
it you can now see these are all green
that's a second set of options and
that's basically useful if you if you
need more than these buttons to do stuff
that's why you would do it that's why
you'd use G shift so that's that let's
go on to the next screen here we have
dpi sensitivity very simple you can
enable a certain amount of levels for
dpi control I only want three because
that's all I can handle and I will use
1400 dpi for sniping mode because I want
a lower sensitivity when I'm scoped that
way I'm less likely to screw up and miss
I'll have this as my default sensitivity
I've already assigned
as default as you can see over here and
then I'll have this as my shift
sensitivity which is a logitech function
so if I used the the dpi shift key it
will shift temporarily to uber twitch
speed which is almost 3000 dpi report
rate is just the Hertz reports per
second so that's I think that's in
frequency which would be Hertz from the
mouse to the unit and I've set that to
500 at 1000 which is a killer I've
actually had issues with with the mouse
freezing and other profiles so I will
not do that
you can enable per profile pointer
settings as you see here if I want dota
to have different sensitivity levels
than rift I can do that and then finally
you have colors so you can do full RGB
spectrum here and and basically just you
see in the background there what's
happening to the mouse pretty cool stuff
you can set the opacity if you don't
want it to be crazy bright well you
should be able to set it oh it must not
be happy because of something I've
checked every here yeah there we go so
you can set the opacity and if you
select the lighting effects here you can
tell it to cycle lighting like this you
see over here there's a full RGB or
ROYGBIV color spectrum you can do pulse
lighting which as you're seeing here
will just pulse on and off and you can
increase the frequency with which it
does that I don't want to have a seizure
so I'm disabling it you can also tell it
to go to sleep when your wave when
you're idle for so on so it doesn't kill
the LEDs won't really conserve any power
though it's only like a watt and then
there are per profile backlight settings
which are just pretty cool you can make
each profile different color that way
it's easier to track which profile
you're using and then this is just the
settings page there's nothing useful to
see here other than a couple toggle
settings so that is really it for the
software for the g600 check out the link
below for the full review I really
encourage it it's a pretty good mouse
but does have very specific applications
so it's not for everyone as with all my
sub course and
it I've had fun with it in MMOs our
other reviewer who worked on the mouse
the actual review said he personally
does not have as many uses for it so it
really just depends on who you are and
what you're doing check out that link
and I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
