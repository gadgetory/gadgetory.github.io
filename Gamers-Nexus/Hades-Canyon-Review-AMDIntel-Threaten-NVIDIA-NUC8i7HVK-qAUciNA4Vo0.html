well-named it's either a reference to
hell freezing over as AMD and Intel work
together on a product or a reference to
the combined heat of Vega and an i7 and
a box that's eight and a half by five
and a half inches in size our review of
Hades Canyon looks at overclocking
potential pre-empting something bigger
for us and benchmarks the combined i7
CPU and Vega M GPU for gaming and
production performance we're also
looking at thermal performance and noise
as usual and as a unit it's one of the
smallest most powerful systems on the
consumer market right now we'll see if
it's worth it before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 there are two primary
skis for the Intel Nikon new egg and
that's separate from Intel's direct
sales the ones on new egg or bare-bones
our unit would be the equivalent of a
$1000 unit on new egg and that includes
an i7 88 oh nine G one of the new G
series processors that's actually giving
Nvidia a lot of trouble right now and
will continue to do so that's got eight
megabytes of cache with a limited
quarter bow of 4.2 gigahertz the CV is
unlocked for overclocking which we doing
momentarily and importantly it's coupled
with an AMD product the Vega M GPU is
specifically Vega m GH whereas the
cheaper unit has a Vega m GL GPU so this
is also overclockable and they are not
on the same die package but they're
adjacent to each other in the unit which
this is the whole thing right here so
you've got your GPU and CPU both on the
side of the board covered by a single
cold plate for heat sinking if you buy
straight from Intel's a simply no
question up
8i seven hvk that we reviewed here comes
fully configured for $1200 including
eight gigabytes of ddr4 and a 128
gigabyte SSD with Windows 10 not
unreasonable really in terms of price
the cheaper unit runs about 200 dollars
lower and instead it ships with an 80
705 G at 4.1 gigahertz and Vega M GL
graphics the differences are these the
higher-end unit runs at 100 megahertz
faster on a quad core 8 thread CPU and
has a TDP of 100 watts instead of 65 and
the Vega GPU also runs 24 compute units
instead of 20 compute units resulting in
1536 streaming processors versus 1280
frequencies also change the GPU and Vega
mgh runs at 1190 megahertz which we
successfully overclocked later to 13 20
megahertz before hitting thermal limits
the Vega mg/l GPU runs at 1011 megahertz
and the memory interface is just 1024
bits wide which is narrow for HP m and
results in a bandwidth of 179 gigabytes
per second for Vega mg/l and 205 for
Vega m GH those are the differences we
weren't sure what to expect for
performance starting out so we ran the
nook through our low-end component
benchmarks for a POS and cheap D GPUs
and we later moved on to high-end
testing for reasons quickly explained in
rocket league for example we rapidly
became bound in the low end GPU testing
for earlier GT 10:30 and apu
benchmarking as illustrated by the rough
62 FPS limiter the stock k ds canyon
system operated at 162 FPS average
several times higher in frame rate than
the r3 1200 and GT 1030 we clearly need
to move to higher end comparisons
overclocking the note despite your
bleeding fan noise when overclocked
netted us an impressive 12 percent
performance uplift here that's from 4.3
gigahertz all core and 13 20 megahertz
on the GPU with 900 megahertz on the HBM
dota 2 further drove this point home
again landing multiple times faster an
average FPS than the next fastest
low-end components 0.1% lowers weren't
great but that's a limitation of dota 2
not the Intel unit csgo
finally put the nail in the coffin we
were running nearly 300 FPS average at
times well ahead of the 45
60 and GT 1030 combination so let's move
on to the higher end benchmarks
basically the low-end stuff sort of
illustrates where we expected the things
of reform this and its predecessors are
inherently small living room targeted
pcs the difference is the predecessor is
working off of basically entirely in two
parts and Intel graphics I've been
pretty limited in performance the
addition of Vega here was a brilliant
one and it's good that AMD and Intel
could work together on it because the
product that came out is something
significantly more powerful than what
Intel would be able to produce on its
own given current technology so I
probably forward gives us a bit of a
best-case for the Vega M GPU has Vega
plays well with the asynchronous compute
shaders used in snipers dx12
implementation note that all these d
GPUs unless otherwise stated
we're tested with our old standard 7700
K at 4.5 gigahertz for GPU benchmarking
we're still GPU bottlenecked in those
cases the stock system lands at 72 FPS
average with lows at 60 fps this
positions at just above the gtx ten to
the TI with an Rx for 70 and 70 700k
outperforming the notes by about 22%
overclocked in the nook pushes us to 81
FPS average closing that gap and
providing performance somewhere between
a 1050 TI and an RR x 470 or 570 when
unrestrained by the CPU for honor gives
us a traditional DirectX 11 title with
more software abstraction layers than
Sniper Elite 4 for this one the Nook
operates at 59 FPS average one stock
with lows at 50 fps
that puts the haiti's Canyon unit about
where a GTX 1050 Ti performs with an rx
470 about 27% ahead when coupled with
the Saudi 700 K overclock in the Nook
pushes it to 65 FPS average load scaling
reasonably for a gain of 11% over stock
Ghost Recon is another traditional dx11
title with very high settings at 1080p
the Hades Canyon Nook ends up at 44 FPS
average again just ahead of the 1050 TI
and below the RX 470 the Vega M GPU and
i7 do well in this game when compared to
much larger discrete components we use
the ashes of the singularity as a
synthetic benchmark at this point but it
does give another dx12 implementation to
consider for this one we're at 30 FPS
average
for the stock nuke or 18 FPS for 0.1%
lows that puts us considerably ahead of
the gtx 750ti about 35% and overclocked
in the nuke positions the stock rx 470
about 13% ahead again not bad for such a
small box though it is screaming loud
and burning up with that overclock
so speaking of overclocking to go over
the process the BIOS is entered by
slamming f2 throughout the boot process
because it boots too quickly otherwise
that gets into Intel's it visual BIOS
which they haven't showed since their
motherboards were killed basically and
then you can use that technically to do
overclocking but we've found that the
XTU utility through software is actually
better typically we don't like saw
through pro overclocking at all but in
this case it gives you the ability to
easily remove many of the power limits
so in the process of overclocking what
you'll run into first is a power limit
for the CPU it's basically immediate and
once you've maxed that out to an
unlimited power limit the next thing you
run into is a thermal limit obviously
and for that you can go into BIOS
increase the fan speed to 100% and
alleviate some of that but not a whole
lot so looking at the unit then all the
cooling is handled here this is the
aluminum fin stack it's pretty small
however they've got it but it up right
against to a pretty large blower fans
taking the heatsink off though we see
that there's more than just the small
aluminum fin stack the entire underside
the cold plate is one giant vapor
chamber which contributes a lot to the
cooling ability of what's otherwise are
pretty small and compact cooling
solution and these blower fans are able
to spin a bit slower than previous
generations just because they're bigger
and so they can push more air with a
lower fan rpm and therefore slightly
lower noise levels which we'll talk
about in a bit so these are pushed right
up against that aluminum fin stack the
aluminum fin stack only gives you so
much area to dissipate the heat even
though the fans are capable of a lot of
airflow so that's our biggest bottleneck
in terms of cooling then there's a
single copper plate right there to sync
the heat from the components in terms of
the overclocking what we ended up with
was 4.3 gigahertz all core for blender
it throttled down to 4.2 over the period
of more than an hour of benchmarking and
we ended up with
memory overclocked to 3200 megahertz
with wot man pushing our GPU for 1320
and 900 megahertz and the power target
maxed out a boxless small will
inevitably become a constrained
thermally when under adverse conditions
with the help of some thermocouples and
software we collected a lot of thermal
data for the stock box and stock fan
curve it went a hundred percent fan
curve was also tested with stock
settings and an overclock configuration
with 100 percent speeds note that all
testing was done in a controlled
environment with constant ambient
temperature ambient was logged second to
second with discrepancies normalized
running firestrike extreme for 30
minutes the stock Cadiz Canyon box
reached steady state at about 76 degrees
Celsius average core temperature this is
completely acceptable the GPU also
operated accepted ly at 70 degrees
Celsius with the SSD at 64 degrees
PCH at 61 degrees and motherboard at 59
degrees with the exact same settings but
an irritating 100 percent fan speed we
measured roughly a 20 degree drop across
the board Intel Tunes the nook to be
usable in a living room and doesn't
blast the fans be done necessarily when
thermals are well within control as they
were in our stock tests regardless that
gives us an idea for Headroom
overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz 13 20
megahertz GPU 900 megahertz for the
memory we landed nearing throttle
territory at 91 degrees Celsius on the
CPU with the GPUs still lower than stock
but that's because of the boost and fan
speed benefiting the GP in this case
more than the CPU which was pushing its
power limit pretty high noise was tested
at our standard 20 inch distance with a
fixed place DBA meter the noise floor of
the room is a low 26 DBA when idle on
desktop and with stock settings we
measured an output of noise of 30 DBA at
20 inches distance not bad and that
extends to lightweight browsing and
things like that gaming under stock
settings and fan curves results in a 36
DBA noise level from 5 minutes to 30
minutes of play and onward which is
certainly audible but not louder than
the average game console under similar
load maxed out we're measuring 53.1 DBA
for the fan but it's high-pitched
whining noise and it resembles a leaf
blower at a distance the type of noise
is irritating fortunately you'll never
really
unless you're manually configuring for a
big overclock like we did so we can't
complain too much this isn't something
you'll encounter under Auto fan curve
settings as for blender on the CPU
components not rendering on Vega M we
measured intel's contribution as
performing roughly equivalently to an
i-5 8400 which completed the GN monkey
had rendered about 43 minutes the Nook
finished in 44 minutes overclocking to
4.3 gigahertz though thermal throttling
down to 4.2 resulted in a forty one
point six minute completion time for the
Nook that puts us between the stockings
how I 580 600 K and the I 580 400 for
the GN logo render we completed the
process in 56 minutes stock or 52
minutes over clocks on the Haiti's
Canyon box comparatively this is roughly
equivalent to either an i5 8400 or r5
1500 acts at 4 gigahertz not
particularly powerful in the CPU front
but that limitation is partly due to
thermals we could overclock higher if we
had thermal Headroom it just doesn't
exist in this box as a unit the Intel
Hades Canyon box actually really
impressed us the performance coming out
of Vega and the AMD contribution is
substantial and is a basically the
primary contributor to the ability of
this hades canyon box to compete with
modern discrete components it does so
exceptionally well it's very expensive
you absolutely pay for the form factor
so if you're trying to replace a cheap
or mid-range gaming computer with one of
these it's not gonna happen at a price
level if you're trying to get one of
these for something like for example
going on the road and using it for
editing which is something we're
strongly considering then it's excellent
for that or if you're trying to use it
for attaching to the back of your TV
with the vase amount and using it for an
H CPC it's really good in those use
cases you could build something similar
for cheaper yes but you couldn't build
something exactly this form factor with
this level of compute power graphics
power especially in such a small
enclosure with reasonable audio levels
at least without the overclocked
overclocking is fun I'm glad they've
enabled it it's nice that it's unlocked
it's not something you should push as
far as we did unless you're really ok
with
ever being able to hear again but beyond
that you can do some basic overclocks
for with without increasing the noise
almost too much you end up have about 40
DBA before it starts to get annoying in
terms of subjective type of noise as a
unit we can absolutely recommend it the
price again it's not unfair it's high
yes but it's not unfair for what you get
the performance was exceptional and
surprised us we really hope to see more
of this in the future the fact that AMD
and Intel here worked together on a
product that actually turned out really
well says a lot about the industry first
of all this is probably partly where
you're seeing GPP and similar Nvidia
initiatives come from and Vidya
definitely is going to feel pressure
from this this doesn't compete with
their DGP you market you don't buy one
of these and put it in a PCIe slot that
said it does show the future for where
they'll see competition in smaller
devices like laptops or other portable
devices so attack makes those Z boxes
things like that suddenly if these Vega
M GPUs and Intel combinations become
more popular and Anthony has got a lot
to worry about and they're going to
probably try to control that market a
little bit which just saw what we're
seeing so they're feeling the pressure
and it's for good reason this is a
really good competition from two people
who basically never worked together
other than cross-licensing x86 and x64
that's the start in the end of their
relationship so we like it like what we
see
yes expensive maybe don't buy it if
you're trying to just get a gaming PC
for cheap because it's not that but if
you have a use case in mind we can
recommend it on a hardware level it
performs well the thermals are
completely reasonable under stock
settings the fan noise was completely
reasonable under stock settings
overclocking is great to have the option
even though it does get a bit loud and
we might try and fix that ourselves an
