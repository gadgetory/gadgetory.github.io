Don that we're here at the inland booth
at CES 2016 we just did a video on the H
tower in the background which is a
semi-automated opening/closing robot
case and you can check that on the
channel if you haven't seen it yet all
of the CES 2016 2016 content is brought
to you by Iowa powers revolt 2 small
form-factor gaming PC right now we're
looking at the 805 chassis that is this
one right here which has an infinity
effect mirror on the front you can see
that there's sort of a black hole effect
with the RGB LEDs this is actually only
one strip in the front so you're seeing
a lot of them but it's just an infinity
of actual mirroring and the RGB LED
strip is crammed into a space that is
around a quarter to 2.3 inches or so
it's not very big the case in Wynn and
Asus they're all working together on
this case to try and produce the RGB
effect and see if they can bring it to
market it is not yet clear at this
particular front panel with the glass
that's in here now and the mirroring
will be on market the cost should be
somewhere to the range of about sixty
dollars more than the non infinity
effect case but if you want something
like this anyone have asked us to ask
you to put comments down in the in the
below area and let us know if you like
this kind of case what you would pay for
it if you were to buy one so that is the
805 the interior is standard there's
really nothing different going on there
and for for cases for PCs it's just all
in this mirrored area we want to show
that off the other case here today other
than the H tower in the background is
the H frame 30th anniversary edition so
the H frame has been out but it's been
upgraded and updated on the look and the
chassis for the 30th anniversary of in
win and that update primarily is with
art with the orange LEDs and you'll see
that in the b-roll so the orange LEDs
illuminate the in win logo and then
there's a strip around the left side
panel for that case other than that it's
got custom bolts custom thumb screws
that are gold and have the n1 low
it's got huge mirrored tempered glass
that's pretty cool and that case is $800
so again like the H tower it's not as
necessarily a consumer case but it's
cool it's the thing that anyone does
they like to show off the art aspect of
case design and engineering so that's
the H tower in the background the H
frame for the $800 case and on the 805
which does not yet have a firm price but
should be about $60 more with this
particular front panel and if you like
