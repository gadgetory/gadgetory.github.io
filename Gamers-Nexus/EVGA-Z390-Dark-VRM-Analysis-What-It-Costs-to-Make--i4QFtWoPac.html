hardcore overclocking and today we're
going to be taking a look at the voltage
regulators on the EVGA z3 90 dark
motherboard and you know I've already
covered all of the features of this
motherboard in the last video so let's
just get right into it because this is
still going to be a long one before that
this video is brought to you by the
coarser 1i 140 compact gaming PC the
corsair 1i 140 is a small form-factor PC
outfitted with a 9700 K RT x 28 e 32
gigabytes of RAM and a 480 gigabyte nvme
SSD all housed within a 2 millimeter
thick aluminum chassis the corsair 1i
140 is a 12 liter system fit for desktop
use with the same size the I 160
counterpart with higher-end parts learn
more at the link in the description
below starting off with the most
important and largest voltage regulator
on the board say hello to the 12 phase V
core VR I'm off of an X 299 dark because
well it's not actually the same they've
changed it quite a bit it has a
different layout different inductors but
the power components themselves are
actually very similar well anyway that's
our V core vrm right here then over here
we have one phase of VCC i/o so that's
our VCC i/o over there then up here we
have a GPU power which is kind of an
interesting conclusion because like the
FTW from EVGA as far as I'm aware does
not actually have an IG PU VRM at all so
yeah if you want to run your eye GPU
this board can the FTW can't which is
kind of an interesting and I did that I
did this mistake twice that's si sorry
that system agent down there this is VCC
IO I don't know why I keep mixing that
up it like I've previous take I made
this exact mistake I was like okay I'll
just restart it and I won't make that
mistake anyway so that's our main
voltage regulators around the CPU socket
pretty standard layout here well
actually it's not completely standard
because they move the VCC i/o up here
but the reasoning for that is very
simple you need two different voltage
controllers because of how many
different voltage like the RMS you have
here right you have your VCC io v GPU so
you need a controller for those two and
then you need another controller for V
core and VC
yes a so al I said earlier V Corps is a
twelve phase V RM and as we all know
nobody makes a twelve phase voltage
controller they only go up to ten phases
as of right now and so EVGA is of course
using doublers to achieve the higher
phase count the doublers used are the
ISL 66 17s and these are a really cool
doubler and the reasoning for that with
them being really really cool is this is
one of the few doublers if not the only
doubler that I'm aware of that does
proper current balancing so essentially
what that means is this chip has enough
circuit like has enough logic in it to
monitor the current going through this
phase and this phase and then if one of
them is pushing let's say you end up in
a scenario where this one is pushing 20
amps and this one's pushing 40 amps well
that's not ideal for your VR M
efficiency which considering this is a
twelve phase that you're not actually
going to see that but anyway just
example you know just as an example so
let's say you're pushing 20 amps through
one and 40 amps through the other phase
well this is not optimal for your VR M
efficiency and it's not optimal for like
the RM thermals because this power stage
will end up getting a bit hotter as a
result and ultimately you know it's it's
imperfect so what the doubler actually
does is it monitors the current through
this phase and this phase as well and
when it sees this kind of current in
balance it will actually extend the PWM
signal going into this phase which is
really really cool because like the next
current balancing method that doublers
use that I'm aware of is they literally
just skip like what they would do is
they would skip the PWM pulse for this
one so basically you'd get two pulses
into the lower current output phase and
the issue with that is it tends to
actually like put like it doesn't
achieve balance so what it does is it
makes the imbalance in the opposite
direction so instead of like you end up
with 20 amps going through the lower
phase and 40 going through the upper
phase so this doubler can actually avoid
that and that gives you better
efficiency because you actually spread
your loading across the entire vrm very
very uniformly and then the is l6 six
one seven of course reports the combined
current of these two phases together to
the actual voltage controller over here
which is the ISL 69 1 3/8 which is
running in 6 plus one phase mode and the
plus 1 is of course being run into the
VCCS a down there so yeah we have our
six you know six phases from the ISL
that goes into our doublers the doublers
spit out to independent pwm signals so
that's what's going on in terms of
control now the doublers like yes they
boost your efficiency they also improve
like that's the main thing they boost
your efficiency they also reduce your
output ripple because you do actually
get like a twelve phase of URM
essentially by doing this there is one
downside to them they do put a bit of
delay on to your pwm signals so you will
have it basically makes it more
difficult to achieve certain levels of
transient response performance because
your pwm signals are gonna be a bit slow
are gonna be a bit delayed so but an
interesting thing about EVGA is
motherboards is that they really like to
use very low inductance inductors and
this is kind of interesting because
basically the trade-offs for low
inductance on your inductors is lower
inductance better transient response so
basically that this is like you get
better transient response with your
lower inductance the downside is that
you get higher output ripple and you
also lose efficiency but if you you know
design your VR a court like correctly
you can basically balance out all of the
negatives of your inductors because the
impact they have on efficiency is
actually really really minor so the the
doublers can kind of take care of that
and the output ripple well we're
interleaving 12 of the damn things you
could have a pretty like one of these
can have a pretty bad voltage waveform
but when you properly interleave every
like 12 of them at that point is stops
being an issue so the doublers kind of
eliminate any have the ability to
potentially eliminate any issues you
would have with output ripple caused by
very low inductances so that's kind of
an interesting thing where like EVGA is
using a hundred and fifty nano Henri's
whereas say asus so asus is doing
something weird where they have their
faces like that well they have their
power stages and inductors running in
parallel so the inductors themselves
rated for like 400 nano Henry's but
since they're in parallel they're
effectively 200 when you see
motherboards that have like faked phases
those inductors are also in parallel and
they're usually rated at around 400 nano
Henry's and effectively therefore become
200 because they're in parallel gigabyte
likes to run 300 nano Henry's MSI tends
to run around 220 when they're using
like one inductor like when they have
separate phases so yeah that's it's kind
of interesting that EVGA basically has
50 nano Henry is less than all the other
board vendors it is worth noting that
for example on GPUs is actually pretty
standard practice to use inductor values
of below 200 nano Henry's mostly because
GPUs have such very well they're the
power consumption of a GPU is really not
consistent so you end up with massive
transient or Spacek elite transient
response becomes extremely important and
so voltage regulators on GPUs tend to
opt for lower inductance inductors just
to sort of you know confident well
basically to deal with the inconsistent
loading that they end on end up under
anyway so that's kind of the control
scheme here ultimately can we make a
judgment from this not really you'd need
an oscilloscope to actually measure how
much of an impact all of EVGA is sort of
control and output inductance decisions
have made now what we don't need to use
an oscilloscope for is to figure out the
efficiency and on this vrm it is
absolutely ridiculous this is the same
12 phase they had on the X 299 dark in
terms of the power stages in phase can't
and the power stages are therefore the
ISL 99 22 7 B's these are 60 amp smart
power stages more and actually these are
thermally enhanced smart power stages so
and they're extra compact so these are
like really really special and really
really expensive they're like five
dollars apiece so yeah there's a good
you know well there's more than six
there's like 60 now so we have sixty in
the week or we have another ten there
and a five over there so we have like
seventy-five dollars worth
our stages on this motherboard EVGA has
you know just kind of blown a good chunk
of the budget on just that but hey the
end result is that this thing gets some
of the best efficiency out of like this
is the most efficient 12 phase on Z 390
and it's almost the most efficient the
most efficient we are I'm on Z 390
period it just kind of depends on what
kind of load you're running anyway so as
for the thermal enhancement part while
this metal tab on these is literate
directly connected into the the actual
silicon of the power stage and that
basically means that these things have a
very low thermal resistance which means
they're very good at cooling themselves
through heat sinks or really just
through ambient air because their case
they're casing material is not as much
of an insulator as what you normally get
the end result is that if you actually
measure the operating temperature of
these power stages like on on this metal
tab and they're not putting out a
significant amount of heat per per phase
like if you're pushing like say one watt
on one of these the temperature
difference between the temperature on
the tab and the temperature inside the
power stage is going to be like what 0.5
degrees Celsius so essentially if you
measure the temperature of one of these
from the top of it you're measuring the
internal temperature almost right
whereas with a lot of other power stages
you make that same measurement and the
temperature difference for one watt can
be anything from 3 degrees to say 7
right if you're like especially terrible
so very very low thermal resistance on
these and basically they're they're
great at cooling themselves so yeah EVGA
has opted for these and you know what
that just just the fact that the power
stages are like thermally enhanced and
really good at dumping eek was not
enough for EVGA you may have noticed
that this board is gold-plated freaking
everywhere and a lot of that is because
EVGA decided that you know what the is
it's not enough that we have probably
the most efficient 12 phase on z3 90 no
it also has to like be completely
capable of cooling itself without a
heatsink so you have this these
basically metal strips right here which
are
the exposed ground plane all over the
vrm so you know that cooling free
cooling right there for the power stages
again and then of course they they have
the screw holes just plated more and
then the outer edge of the PCB is also
just gold-plated like that so
essentially the PCB itself is upgraded
into sort of being more of a heatsink
than the PCB normally is so that's what
that's what's going on with all of the
gold plating that EVGA has on here
anyway at this point you're probably
wondering okay so this vrm is really
good at dumping eat it has very
extensive power stages how efficient is
it very very efficient so operating
parameters for this vrm are going to be
one point three five volts output 500
kilohertz switching frequency and five
volts drive voltage because these don't
actually run on anything other than
twice than five volts anyway and that's
a terrible five there much better so 5
volts drive voltage 500 kilohertz
switching frequency and that is per
power stage so that's like one megahertz
at the controller right because the
doublers cut that switching frequency in
half so one megahertz at the controller
500 kilohertz on the power stage
so with these operating parameters on
this erm it will produce is it is
capable of pushing a hundred amps output
at only 10 watts of heat dissipation it
doesn't need a heatsink
this kind of this kind of load it really
doesn't need a heatsink and
interestingly enough this is actually if
you look at the efficiency curve for a
standard power stage like say the ISL
9920 s to seven B unfortunately that
falls in the normally the curves look
like that that falls into this part so
this is actually like but honestly if
the board is pushing less than a hundred
amps assuming EVGA has the voltage
controller properly configured it
shouldn't even run all twelve phases if
you're pushing only a hundred amps it
should probably run like ten or eight
phases max because pushing all twelve
phases for a hundred amp load is
actually less than optimal efficiency
at this point but anyway moving on to a
higher load so this is like the upper
limits of what a 99 hundred K can do
before it becomes completely uncool well
can do in terms of sort of ambient
cooling methods and we ready for this
you're gonna be looking a like dilated
CPU with potentially like a direct die
frame you're you're not gonna be able to
achieve this kind of current draw on the
stock Intel the solder ring because the
solder just doesn't like it's not good
enough at thermal transfer to do that
anyway at 200 amps output this vrm is
only going to produce about 18 watts of
heat so that's what I said about you
know we're moving up on the efficiency
curve so the this the the ratio of
current to heat output is better here
than at you know there anyway moving
past 200 amps going into the 300 amp
territory we actually start getting into
like actually the interesting thing is
this 12 face hits peak efficiency pretty
much at 1200 at 200 amps output so it's
pretty much like optimized for running a
99 hundred K as far as I'm concerned and
without a heatsink line you which like
you know EVGA has a very elaborate
cooling system on this motherboard but I
think this board looks really really
good without anything on it so quite
frankly well you might need you might
still want the chips i heatsink because
that thing looks horrendous but uh you
know if you'd like to admire your vrm
while the board is running in your
system especially if you have like a
side panel window which putting this
board in in case is not the correct use
for it but you know if you do go that
way you can actually run it without the
heatsink and it's gonna be fine and you
can stare at your very expensive power
stages these power stages probably like
three of these probably cost more than
the heat sinks on top of them so anyway
moving on the 300 amps output you're
gonna be looking at about 30 watts of
heat so now we're back at that part of
the efficiency curve that's on par with
that like the efficiency is back at to
the levels of like the hundred amps
output and then going up to 400 amps
you're gonna be looking at about 47
watts of heat and then finally 500 amps
which is like like honestly liquid
nitrogen is going to top out around 300
amps it's not even going to reach 400
amps but you know this is a crazy 12
phase
so for fear of for Theory's sake 500
amps what would happen well it would
produce about 66 watts of heat and
interestingly enough EVGA rates this vrm
while they spec the board's power
delivery system for about 800 watts
which tells us that they probably have
it like the cooling system on this
motherboard as its did like as it chips
is designed probably for around 50 watts
of heat dissipation because 800 watts at
one point 3 5 volts is somewhere between
that 400 and 500 amp figure so yeah um
you know this this VR I'm is absolutely
massive overkill for a well I wouldn't
like its peak efficiency right it nails
that peak efficiency so that's really
nice for these given power stages so
yeah it's it's a really nice erm me like
is technically ridiculous overkill like
there's nothing so if you had better
heat like if you have heat sinks on
these then there's nothing stopping you
went running like there on the
efficiency curve right but uh still it's
like a good choice like I feel like EVGA
didn't do the like because there's a
couple Zi 390 motherboards out there
which technically at the higher current
loads can do better like the the 300
amps 400 amps and 500 am figures there's
e 390 boards that can handle those loads
better than the dark the thing is at
that point you're actually going to be
like disabling huge chunks of their
voltage regulators to maintain decent
efficiency below 200 amps which this one
kind of like they shouldn't have to do
that until around like a hundred so you
know ii v vga has basically like not
none the silly thing because they could
have like there's enough space here to
put a 16 phase if they felt like it it
just wouldn't be even remotely practical
to do and also the is on 99 the six nine
one three eight doesn't actually support
that they could have gone for a 14 where
they'd have like a 7 + 0 setup and then
another controller but anyway the this
is like a really good fit for a ninety
nine hundred k in terms of power
delivery definitely kind of excessive
but not to say the extent of some of the
other zi 390 boards out there so let's
talk about some other zi 390 boards for
comparison sake i
pulled up my note while pulled up the
numbers for like the Aces five phase
that Asus has on the Maximus 11 extreme
as well as the Maximus 11 gene and that
that vrm at 200 amps output gets about
21.5 watts of heat dissipation so it
technically could still run without a
heatsink but considering that it has
less like that VR M is more compact and
than this one it has less inherent
capability to cool itself it doesn't use
doublers so it's a like well actually
that wouldn't impact it unless you crank
up the switching frequency really high
which you can do in the in the BIOS
settings but anyway so you know that
this is more efficient than like the vrm
you get on a Maximus I'll have an
extreme where Maximus 11 gene excessive
like honestly as I've said like it's a
bit excessive still but it is worth
pointing out that it is more efficient
at 300 amps the the gene you know that
while I like to call it the asus v phase
cuz that's what it is would do about 36
watts and at 400 amps it would do about
58 watts and that's by no means like I
don't consider that a bad vrm it's just
like it's a good 5 phase right you
wouldn't really get a five phase that
does better than that it's just like
it's still a five phase and it is less
efficient than this and then for
ridiculous mode gigabytes z 390 extreme
board and MSI Z 390 godlike so both of
those use a 16 phase vrm using
international rectifier components so
they don't have a current balancing
doublers whatsoever but there's so many
phases in there that from basically 200
amps up they actually have a efficiency
advantage at least if the phase shedding
works properly at 200 amps those boards
the sort like the MSI and the gigabyte
board the the top-end MSI and Giga Byte
boards would do 16 watts for the the 200
amps 24 watts at 300 amps and that's if
they shed the phases so that would be
running in 12 phase mode so yeah it's
kind of interesting that like I told
gigabyte like why didn't you go for a 12
phase like honestly under normal loading
this thing is gonna have like the this
thing is wasting power running X and
another 4 phases that the like you're
not peeking efficiency yet because yeah
that
that 16 watts is assuming they would be
hitting the efficiency if they weren't
then it would actually get worse
efficiency and anyway going up to 400
amps the gigabyte board would only
produce about gigabyte or MSI zp9 you
got a gigabyte extreme Z 390 godlike
from MSI would do about 34 watts
so yeah that we RM is impractical levels
of overkill
this is what I consider practical levels
of overkill this is also like like
acceptable in my opinion I still think
Asus should have like the controller
they used could have gone to a six phase
and it wouldn't have really like you
would have taken up more space on the
board but it wouldn't have really had
any other negative impacts so yeah I'm
not sure why they're like especially on
such expensive boards too but anyway
it's not like it's a disaster but I
really like this VR I'm ultimately I
don't think this is like a huge design
win over the other board vendors but it
is a really really nice vrm and it is
like well thought out anyway moving on
to the system agent vr m as well as the
vc cio they're both single phase this
ones of course hanging off of the 69 138
here and it uses an ISL 99 what it wait
now nine nine one four zero yes so it
uses a 999 one four zero which is just a
regular power stage capable of 40 amps
output and yeah I mean system agent
doesn't really pull much like system
agent doesn't pull a whole lot of
current ever so this is actually
perfectly adequate for for powering the
system agent absolutely no problem with
that in fact it's rather overkill you
quite frankly wouldn't heat a heatsink
on like this this if they didn't put it
under the vrm heatsink that the V curve
erm has it like it doesn't need its own
one I'm like if they've moved this phase
up here or something
so anyway and this is actually nicer
than a lot of the VC csavr M's you find
on a lot of other boards but again this
is like this is impractical levels of
overkill because the other boards also
don't even need to heat sinks because
system agent just pulls so little power
compared to a lot of it like compared to
V core or anything
like that vc cio same situation vc cio
pushes even like the the IO pulls even
less power than the system agent so the
this is even more overkill because
that's again the same is l99 one four
zero one four zero there except the VCC
i io is controlled by this controller
right here which is also controlling the
V GPU and that is an ISL 6969 one three
three and that's a four phase running in
two plus one phase mode so you do get a
two phase I GPU power and four i GPU
power the EVGA is using again the ISL
9999 twenty two seventy bees which are
ridiculous overkill for you know i GPU
power so there's two phases of that as
well another interesting thing to note
about the the VRML and the ZT 90 dark
here is actually EVGA has opposite for
all tantalum output filled like bulk
output filtering capacitors which i'm
not sure how much of an impact that has
these are generally more expensive than
your conventional like aluminum polymers
like that and we used to see these a lot
on motherboards in the past like they
were a pretty big deal like gigabyte had
boards with them msi had boards with
them and they'd like advertise it pretty
heavily that hey we're using all
tantalum capacitors but i think more
recently the aluminum polymers have
probably just mostly caught up in a like
efficiency and performance to these so
these days you just see aluminum
polymers everywhere instead of anybody
going for these but uh yeah it's an
interesting decision from EVGA to go for
these because they do have slightly well
they have not necessarily better ESR but
they may have liked better yes out well
ESL would definitely be better on these
just because of the packaging they're in
compared to your aluminum polymers but
ultimately that's one of those things
where again you'd need an oscilloscope
to check if these make much of a
difference if any at all but they are
like it's an interesting design choice
by EVGA moving up top memory power is
provided by yes another is L is L $6.99
22 7b this is like ridiculous overkill
for memory power interestingly enough
EVGA goes for like the single phase
memory power whereas a lot of other
board vendors go for like two phase
memory power like asus and asrock really
likes to go for two phase memory power
ultimately you know you can compensate
for low phase account with output
filtering and I've hinted at this in the
features video EVGA is output filtering
is rather elaborate for the memory power
here so you know I think essentially
they decided like we can set the
switching frequency on this really high
because ultimately it doesn't need to
push a lot of power in the first place
or a ddr4 barely pull like a ddr4 really
doesn't pull much power whatsoever
so we can set the switching frequency
really really high to compensate
potentially for the low phase count and
then they really do have a rather
elaborate to output filtering system so
I don't think this is like like I guess
it's just like a design style choice
more than like a practical decision
there where EVG is like we're gonna run
one phase and a lot of the like as Rahl
kinases like to do two phase but MSI I
think likes to go one phase as well and
gigabyte never gigabyte likes to do
single phase memory power as well more
recently in the past we saw some boards
go all the way up to three phase memory
power but that was the same kind of
logic that you know Britt brings you the
the sixteen phase that needs to turn off
four phases in order to hit peak
efficiency at 200 amps it's essentially
just smacking on phases for the sake of
having phases which not exactly you know
a great way to design things anyway the
memory is controlled by yet another is
l69 133 except that's running in just
like 1+0 mode because there's one phase
on it
so that is the voltage regulators on the
EVGA z3 90 dark I'm a like you know it's
not my like it's not anything my well
mind-blowing I think compared to like
some of the other things EVGA has done
here right this is a very similar vrm as
to what they used on the X 299 dark
in terms of the vcore then they've just
kind of added phases for the extra rails
that are necessary in fact they didn't
even add phases like VCC io and VCC sa
was also present on the on the dark so
that's that's not new and just basically
the AI GPU power is new the memory vrm
is actually again like they had the same
you know 60 amp hour stage from memory
power on the dark and it was also a
single phase well for each set of DIMM
slots and that one just had like that
one didn't have quite as elaborate of an
output filtering setup so yeah that's
kind of the the the vrm configuration
here on the on the z 390 dark it's just
like it is very it's a very expensive
vrm right it's also very very efficient
one of the actually I think it's
probably like the like its second most
of it while depends on you know the
phase shedding there but ultimately it's
like the second most efficient
definitely one of the most efficient
VRMs on Z 390 in general but right now
as far as I'm aware it's about second
for the 200 amp figure and then well at
the higher currents definitely it's not
not the top but you shouldn't really
like you don't need to worry about the
higher currents because it's basically
200 amps plot like anything above 200
amps is very much sub-zero cooling
territory and at that point you know
you're probably not going to be running
the the whatever workload you're running
is not going to be running that long so
then you can just kind of rely on the VR
like it takes so like well the benefit
to having all the efficiency is that of
course it takes so long for the vrm to
overheat that you don't need to have
heat sinks on it even when pushing very
very high currents like that 300 or 400
amps which if you're running on liquid
nitrogen the other thing that happens is
ultimately the board freezes over and
not having to run heat sinks on the
board does mean that you can just have
insulation freaking everywhere instead
of worrying about you know water
building up between water potentially
building up on the power stages which
would actually really really suck with
these because there's a great big like
that exposed drain is a great big 12
volt tab right there and if that shorts
to anything really yeah you're gonna
have a bad day well actually no that's
the that tab right there is the
the no is the switch node of the phase
so it's not well occasionally it's at 12
volts other times it's a like VRML put
voltage so yeah like you still don't
want that shorting to ground and like at
all so you know that's kind of that
anyway yeah I mean like after the X 299
dark this is kind of what I expected you
know it's more of the same and that's
that's definitely not a bad thing and
except this does actually go more
elaborate on the cooling system right
like the the like they they I feel like
they've really made better use of all
the gold plating they gone for because
on the dark it really like it does not
use that much it kind of feels more like
an aesthetics thing there but here I I'd
like their back of the board acts as its
own heat sink which is pretty cool so
yeah that is it for the Z 390 dark vrm
