Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
an taks a new cooler 1250 closed-loop
liquid cooling solution which uses an
umlaut so of course it is very good at
being in a metal band I guess and it
actually it uses a unique dual pump
design with the palms mounted atop the
fans so it is a bit different than what
we're used to
I ended up with two of these to test so
I decided to take the whole thing apart
and show you how it works as well as of
course the normal benchmarking first the
specs antics cooler 1250 is their newest
high end 240 millimeter liquid cooler
using an entirely in-house design and
custom tooling by an Tek most CL CS that
we commonly talked about if you are not
aware use a stack for their their
components and a stack is a supplier
that basically builds the same product
and puts new stickers on it there
they're just they they make it and then
Corsair NZXT whatever they put their
sticker and their LED on it so
occasionally some coolers to use other
suppliers like cool it and there are a
couple others but the point is that an
in-house design is rare it's pretty much
limited to Coolermaster Antec and maybe
one or two offhand designs from other
companies right now the 1250 uses two
high rpm 120 millimeter fans bolted to
the radiator and these are pre-installed
so you won't be able to install your own
fans but they are pretty high-powered
stock atop each fan is a pump the pumps
work in a push-pull configuration to
move the coolant through the radiator
and the cold plate so I say push pull of
course it's just a pump right it just it
just pumps it does both pushing and
pulling but because there are two of
them it is more efficient at pushing it
to the CPU and then pulling it back up
to the red from the bottom up and this
is true for all liquid coolers from the
bottom up we start with a copper cold
plate that rests atop the CPU the cold
plate uses a smooth copper finish for
direct contact with the CPUs IHS and a
thermal interface obviously goes between
the two for any bumps that that need to
be mitigated the cold plate is attached
to the CPU block which is where our two
hoses connect and liquid goes comes in
from one hose and is pushed through the
channels in the cold plate so the
whole plate as you can see actually has
little channels cut through the copper
so it's pushed through those and then
it's pulled out the next hose and and
kind of push pulled back up to the
radiator once the liquid ascends the
exit tube and reaches the radiator the
entire time this is happening the pumps
are working in unison to do all of the
movement and they connects because there
are two pumps we see an accelerated rate
at which the liquid moves which of
course accelerates the rate at which it
cools down and can be reused so the
cycle is is a bit faster and more
efficient in theory cooler liquid of
course does mean a cooler cold plate
which means a cooler CPU so the concept
is very simple and in theory it sounds
fantastic in practice you'll see the
performance results in a moment what
you're seeing right now though is a
comparison of the antec cooler pump
design against the standard ACE tech
supplied one in this case a corsair h
110 you can see that the h 110 uses a
plastic rotor to pump the liquid through
the channels that ultimately cools the
cold plate the pump itself is on top of
the CPU in this instance so it is
responsible for pushing the liquid to
the radiator and then pulling it back
down and this is fundamentally different
from the 1250 s design and and we'll see
which one performs better in benchmarks
the H 110 is the current leader on our
CPU cooler chart FYI now as great as all
of this sounds antics design does have a
few complications but they're not too
bad I do want to go over them though for
starters it's bulky if your case was
advertised as being designed for a 240
millimeter radiator they might have
designed that specifically for the
standalone radiators which use user
mounted fans the NZXT phantom cases for
instance you wouldn't be able to mount
the Antec 1250 in the top of those cases
because the fans are too tall and
there's not enough clearance so you'd
have to install the cooler on the
underside of this which of course means
it will hang into the case more this
could be a problem with some enclosures
it wasn't with the 820 I was testing
with similarly problematic the mounting
system for the 1250 is one of the most
annoying installations I've ever endured
for a CPU cooler it's it's kind of
clumsy and cumbersome for a few reasons
an Tek checklist they say it
super easy I mean you know great if you
guys make it and you can install it fast
right that's probably a good thing you
should probably be able to do that
I found it annoying so the biggest
reason it was annoying is because the
mounting bracket itself brushes right up
against the chokes on some motherboard
designs for the vrm in my case I'm using
a GD 65 from MSI it's sitting on those
chokes and installing it made me nervous
enough to really you know double check
myself constantly take a few tries to
get the bracket tightened and there's
barely enough clearance on either side
where the RAM goes and where the vrm
heat sinks go for the hoses and the
cabling so it did fit just you know if
you have one of those boards it will fit
but it did take a good bit of courage to
do so all that said the design itself is
fairly innovative when it comes to the
present CLC market and I'm excited to
see where antec takes it let's get to
benchmark so you can view our full
testing methodology in the article in
the link below on the bench antics
cooler is a firm first place liquid
cooler takes our best of bench award
away from Corsair and is on this is on
the extreme setting I'll talk about
settings in a second you can see it's
positioned just ahead of course there's
a CH 110 which is our previous pack
leader on the CPU cooler bench it seems
that the dual pump design in this case
actually does work quite well and the
custom fans do impact cooling pretty
substantially antic software controls
the fan speed settings and the lighting
the LEDs there are two different
settings extreme and silent and then
there's a custom setting that you can
configure rpms vary from 600 to 3000
with 3000 and 650 being the extreme and
silent settings respectively quite
honestly the extreme setting sounds like
a jet engine and is in my opinion too
loud for normal human use it's great if
you're doing extreme overclocking or
rendering where you can kind of walk
away from the machine or you don't care
about noise but if you're gaming or if
you're watching a movie you don't want
that noise so it's not a setting you'd
ever want while gaming but it's not made
for that right it's made for extreme
overclocking so if it's not the right
setting for it
I made the same exact statement about
coarse hair and NZXT is extreme settings
basically think of Extreme as the
showcase it's the showcase car silent is
is truly pretty dead silent and I
here any annoying whirring or
vibrational noise and that is the
showcase of as quiet as it gets I found
that using a custom setting at 1500 rpm
works best it gives good cooling power
and it still keeps it relatively silent
about as quiet as your PSU fan will be
anyway and antica if you're listening
make a 1500 RPM mid-range option a
default choice maybe even the stock
choice it makes the most sense for
end-users let them play around and
custom with some other things but give
them 1500 by default as for the LED
stuff it's pretty basic big range of
LEDs nothing important so you can set
any color you want including black
overall I'm very satisfied with the an
tech cooler 1250 installation is a
serious overhaul and if I see it again
I'm gonna keep complaining about it
until it's fixed but I can live with the
hassle given the awesome performance and
silence options just be aware that
you're gonna curse and yell while here
trying to figure out if it'll actually
fit on your board with the chokes anyone
who wants to stay away from an open-loop
cooling but still has a large budget for
liquid or wants silence this is our new
front runner it handily beats out
Corsairs H 110 at 120 bucks it's a
pretty competitive price about the same
price maybe a little more and a easy
pickup all day long if you're looking
for alternatives I'd say check out
antics 950 for a smaller form factor
version of this also NZXT is X 40 for a
small version and Corsairs H 110 is
still a damn good cooler if you can pick
it up at 80 bucks it's probably worth
saving the money just depends on your
budget and your objectives silverstone
has a brand new unit out and I'm in the
process of reviewing that now check
descriptions for links to all these
products in the description below that
will help you find something for your PC
if you need more help post on our forums
it's free support for you to ask a
question and I hit the full review and
benchmark below and I will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
