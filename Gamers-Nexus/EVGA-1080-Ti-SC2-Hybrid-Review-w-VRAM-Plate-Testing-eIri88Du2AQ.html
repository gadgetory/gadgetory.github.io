1080 TI FC two hybrids that we tore down
before copy text this will probably be
one of the last 10 HD eyes that we
review for some time and that's because
the FPS is really pretty much the same
so is overclocking between all of these
a IB partner models but there's one
really important aspect that's not
looked at too frequently and that is
noise as it compares to thermals
particularly when you normalize for one
of them and test all the coolers at the
same DBA output before that this content
is brought to you by custom backplate
makers at v1 tech comm v1 tech builds GP
back ways to order with their online
customization tool making it easy to
theme upcoming PC build back plates cost
$25 end up and are installed via magnet
and can be seen in some shots of the
cards reviewing that lately used code
gamers Nexus 5 for 5 dollars off your
order or click the link below so this is
the st2 hybrid we tore down previously
as stated and showed that as we've seen
in the past cards there is a VRAM
cooling plate that connects by thermal
paste to the CLC which is an EVGA liquid
cooler that's made by AC text an AC tech
4.5 gen pump those run a bit faster than
Gen 4 at around 3600 rpm plus or minus a
couple hundred rpm and it's got an EVGA
fan they've done some changes to the
cooling solution for this round of
hybrid cards versus the previous round
but the main thing of note is that this
is still an ST - so it's the same PCB as
the other SC - the air-cooled one which
is the same PCB as the reference card
and it's still got the SC two add-ons
like the icx thermistors on it the MTC's
that are on the board so this card is
not too different from the st2 that we
already reviewed for that reason we're
not even going to look at gaming
performance in this video because
honestly it's pointless it's going to be
the same the thing that we care about
here is just thermals and then noise as
it relates that we've got all the tests
on that of course in terms of interior
construction it's got the beer and plate
for cooling on the memory module and
then there's actually a separate piece
once you pull the shroud off and we can
show our teardown footage of the vrm
cooling component so that's a tiny fan
at the top and aluminum
heat sink was just a thin stack and that
covers your BRM components whereas the
vram is covered by the plate and then
the backside has the normal aluminum die
cast plate split into two with their old
pads to connect to the back side of the
PCB the BRM fan really doesn't do a
whole lot unless it has to it tends to
sit passive at 0% rpm when it's not
under any workload at all and then once
you put a real gaming word or a power
virus workload on it it'll go to about
28 percent of its total spinning its RPM
availability and that tends to be about
870 to 900 rpm so it's really quiet it
doesn't really pick up on a noise meter
if you're running with the radiator fan
under any kind of load anyway basically
making the vrm fan silenced because it's
just going to be covered up by
everything else in the system and then
the radiator fan as we'll get into with
the noise testing still runs a bit
louder EVGA has had this thing for a
while now where their cards tend to be a
bit louder but also cooler than their
competition finally they're doing
something about that it does seem like
the cards are getting quieter with time
this is the first hybrid card we've
tested where it's actually closer to 40
DBA rather than being at something like
44 so good on them for listening to that
criticism and moving to improve there's
still some things they could do for
example currently in this state the
radiator fan slaves to the liquid
temperature which is an ASA tech thing
that's not really something that EVGA
has control over there's a thermocouple
stuck into the pump block and it's
coated in a ton of thermal paste and
that is what tells us the liquid
temperature EVGA has this fan slaving to
that temperature which tends to be
something like 26 to 32 Celsius or
thereabout
doesn't really go higher than that and
because liquid temperature doesn't go
higher than that almost ever the fan is
following a parameter that doesn't make
a lot of sense to follow but with the
new sixth generation of base tech pumps
that should change we talked about in
our Computex coverage at the Corsair
suite we are curious to learn more about
that let's get into the testing as
always you can find the full testing
methodology in the article that's linked
in the description below we're starting
off with a really simple chart this is
frequency versus time so there's really
only two things we'll look at here
in temperature over a time axis and as
you can see it's fairly smooth overall
starting out we don't really lose a
whole lot off the clock from the get-go
like we do with a lot of the air coolers
but you do still have dips at times
moving on to more important test in like
thermals versus the sc2 non-hybrid and
then later we'll test with the vram
plates on versus often an a/b test we
can see in this chart that the SC 2 and
SC 2 hybrid are easily compared given
that their thermistors are located in
the same places though we do actually
place our own thermocouples on the card
as well in addition to EB J's MTC's our
ability to compare these two cards
directly is in contrast to the FTW 3
which is not comparable in power
component readouts given it's completely
different power design and more
importantly it's different NTC location
on the board we've seen some people
online compare the FCW 3 and sc2
thermistors to each other in temperature
testing but unfortunately it doesn't
really work like that because they're in
different spots EVGA is doing better
this generation with hybrid cooling as
stated previously and seems to have
learned that running a 100% rated or fan
speed all the time isn't actually
necessary that's reflected in these
results we don't see quite as big of a
thermal improvement as in previous
generations that's because the noise
levels are actually tolerable now and
have gone down this has been Evie J's
biggest weak point for a long time now
and they're working to resolve the noise
output while meeting expectations
thermally that t2 hybrid looks to be
about at the right place ranking 20
Celsius lower than sc2 non-hybrid and GP
diode readings about 13 C lower in mem
110 T lower in mem 290 lower on mem 3
and then power component temperatures
are also down a bit across the board a
regarding the previous numbers and some
of the other ones coming up a couple
quick notes here we take thermals a lot
more seriously than you might be used to
if you're new here and that means that
some of what we do involves logging
different types of thermal readouts and
for these 2 that would be V RAM and one
of the power components to validate EVGA
Zen pcs make sure that they're telling
an accurate measurement of the
temperature and also just so that we
have comparable data to our previous
test then we run another set of
thermocouple to monitor the ambient
temperature and that is used to apply a
modifier to the results as necessary
to make sure that we've normalized for
ambience as best we can and then further
our testing measurements the averaging
for the numbers that you see in the bar
charts not the overtime charts is done
at steady-state so that's once the GPU
has stopped fluctuating at least within
reason because of the way we're working
with the modifier now not all values are
going to be a hard delta T over ambient
but some of them are if they are we'll
mention it and the chart will say so
we're moving now to our noise normalize
the charts where we configure the cards
to run at a forty DBA output this helps
us understand cooling efficiency for
card rather than just its stock
performance so our performance of course
is highly variable and will hinge
completely on whether the manufacturer
built for noise or for thermals here
we're looking at strictly the cooling
efficiency at a fixed noise output and
we're not yet normalizing for power but
might do that in the future starting
with GPU numbers the EVGA 1080 is c2
hybrid is the second coolest on our
charts operating a sustained 24.9
southeast LT over ambient this places
the card about twenty C cooler than the
FT w3 though that TW three had some
testing caveats that we detailed in our
unveiling of this test method which was
the AC strict review primarily that we
configured the fans to a synchronous
speed the extreme or discard is nearby
with the gaming ex still showing the
prowess of MSI's Twin Frozr dual air
cooler design Asus keeps a hold of the
best efficiency for an air cooler title
and is outranked only by the liquid
cooled devices by about six Celsius at
that the armor is the worst card we've
tested when air cooled but it's gaming
ax PCB makes it an excellent candidate
for h2o which is what you see here the
armor CL C is a 570 LC and we're also
using a gentle typhoon fan but there's
something else that's more important
EVGA is sharing its liquid cooling
solution with a copper plate that
conducts from the vram increasing the
heat load relative to the constant heat
dissipation we are increasing our heat
load by approximately 15 watts by doing
this because we're also cooling the VM
but again these are just the GPU
temperatures moving now it's a power
component temperatures we see the sc2
runs a warmer vrm target than its
neighbors at 42.2 celsius delta T over
ambient near the gaming axe and FTW
three this is another situation like the
FT w3 where we could
configure the vrm fans run faster while
the radiator fan could have run slower
but we ultimately decided to follow EVGA
zhan fan curve the curve dictated a
roughly 28 percent of erm fan rpm under
load which fit well with our 70% rated
or fan rpm for a 40 DBA output jointly
performance isn't neither impressive nor
bad we are well within the spec of these
FETs even when measuring what is
effectively a case temperature finally
here's a look at VRAM performance the
sc2 hybrid manages to keep the lowest
vram temperature of all largely thanks
to EVGA his decision to cool the vram
via copper plate like contact the CLC
and the other cards at least some of
them are not far behind but we were
curious how much that copper plate would
actually impact things if removed so we
ran some a b tests with it taken off the
radiator fan was configured to 100% for
these tests the vrm fan again at 28% our
difference in GPU temperature is within
error bars and so is effectively
identical the rest of the temperatures
see a hike particularly for memory the
copper plate improves performance from
66 Celsius to 55 Celsius on mem 173 to
58 on them - pretty big jump and from 68
to 61 Celsius on them three power
follows this trend just to a lesser
degree finally here's a look at the
noise output verses various RPMs on the
radiator and vrm fans under Auto
settings the EVGA card tends to stick
just around or right under 40 DBA plus
or minus 3 DBA depending on how heavy
the load is when it is closer to those
lower load scenarios and we still think
EVGA could improve their noise with
these cards but it does start to enter
territory where your max temperatures
run higher for lower noise and although
that reflects well for folks who care
about noise it might not look good in
less scrupulous reviews or for more
casual users thermals are good here
they're not the best temperatures we've
ever seen out of an EVGA hybrid card but
that's for a few reasons one of them
EVGA is finally figuring out fan curves
to balance the noise level to the
temperatures because you don't need to
run a 30 or 40 Celsius core temperature
at the risk of really high noise so they
figured that out and that means that
noise has gone down which is great
but temperatures of course have gone up
a little bit it's still much cooler than
most of the air-cooled cards although
the asus strix is a pretty good
competitor if you do prefer air it's
just at $780 as well so there's that to
consider and check out our Strix review
for the rest on that this thing also
contributes to what appear to be higher
GPUs that diode or core temperatures
because again you're increasing the
amount of heat and watch we're adding
about 15 watts of heat cooling the vram
to the CLC this is getting synced to the
CLC and so of course your temperatures
are going to look a bit higher and
that's part of that as well in terms of
generational improvement between the
EVGA hybrid series or in this case
generational slight increase in GPU
temperatures at Auto settings because
they've actually improved things so it's
not quite as cut and dry as is it cooler
than previously clearly because it's not
necessarily cooler than previously but
it's still better as a whole so EVGA is
done well there now this is still an 810
dollar card it's not going to gain
better than a 720 dollar card it's not
getting better than the sc2 Black
Edition for the most part there will be
a slight change because the clock rates
are a bit different and that's really
about it you if you really really cared
about that 1% 1 to 3% change you could
overclock the card they're going to
overclock pretty close to the same
because they're all 1080p eyes that
doesn't really change til you start
getting into exotic cooling or into
custom BIOS tweaking like with a kingpin
or with a lightning card it's going to
be the same for gaming performance what
does matter is noise and temperatures
temperatures are pretty close to some of
the better air-cooled cards the gaming X
at $750 just does just fine the FT w3 at
780 dollars also does fine although we
would recommend the asus strix over that
one which is also having hundred and
eighty dollars but for noise levels you
can get a lot further with liquid which
is what this does so if noise is
something that you care deeply about
then it's not a bad idea to grab
something like this or look into one of
the other CLC cards we haven't reviewed
the Seahawk because they've really just
not been available this generation but
this card if you care about noise or
what you should do
is probably connect a different fan or
plug this one into the motherboard
control the fan speed manually set it to
one speed permanently because you can
run it at 40% and it'll be fine for life
and then you also get rid of the change
in noise where you get the frequency
change as the fan ramps so you get rid
of that you have a lower noise output in
DB a you have a more consistent noise
output in frequency and you have similar
cooling performance to the best air
cooled card but quieter so that's the
way to use this card now that does mean
that a lot of people get priced out and
that's fine don't buy it
if that doesn't work for you or if you
don't care about that because they
hundred dollars is too much if you don't
care about noise and you're buying one
of these but that should pretty much
