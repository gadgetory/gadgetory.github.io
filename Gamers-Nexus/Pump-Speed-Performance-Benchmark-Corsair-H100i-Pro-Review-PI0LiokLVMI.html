corsair product to use ASA Tech's sixth
generation pump solution
ASA tech didn't push performance in
significant ways with the Gen six pump
but instead focused on endurance
improvement and reducing hot spots that
encourage permeation of the tubes this
time just to keep things sort of
interesting we'll talk about how pump
speed impacts the performance of this
particular cooler and how these stock
thermal paste application can also
impact performance a topic we've
explored with previous gen 5 coolers
from other vendors before that this
video is brought to you by thermal takes
view 37 case the vo 37 focuses on
highlighting custom PC builds with its
fall panoramic window and tinted front
acrylic and our thermal testing the view
37 performed reasonably well when
considering its looks focused build
which is partly thanks to the airflow
design and the removal of a bottom power
supply shroud for a balance of looks and
performance check the link in the
description below for the view 37 so a
quick overview of how all this works Gen
5 and gents pumps are from ASA tech a
supplier that makes the pumps and
radiator solution we're basically all
the closed-loop liquid coolers on the
market not a hundred percent of them but
pretty darn close and their main
competitors are people like Dino Tron
who don't do a whole lot these days used
to do the anti cooler coolers the other
competitors would be enter max or a pol
tech or people like that there aren't a
whole lot of them cool it or quality we
prefer make some of course here's other
coolers as well so most of the market
probably two-thirds or greater at this
point would be ASA tech made that's the
supplier courser had a significant hand
in designing the gens expose the first
client to use the Gen 6 pump and so it
has a couple of there changes on it one
of them is more RGB and integrated RGB
PCB to handle all the LEDs something
that NZXT had sort of pioneered with
their kraken series and later was
brought over to other coolers like EVGA
s and so forth
another thing that Corsair worked on
with their specific version of the Gen 6
coolers is a smaller cold plate by a
little bit it's not a whole lot smaller
they have a
our pump housing and pump plate overall
so everything's just a little bit
smaller and they were also responsible
for making the fans which is something
that basically all the manufacturers
have to do to have any kind of
difference between one cooler or another
so there's a primary differences with
Gen 6 Gen 6 really was just driving to
improve the endurance so asa tech had a
couple of known hot spots in the Gen 5
coolers where with higher liquid
temperatures 60 C+ you start having
plastic deformation or plastic melty and
or other issues with just permeation of
the tubes where the liquid seeps into
the tubes and it never comes out again
so you'd have to refill it really to
keep it peak operation and that's an
issue of the liquid not moving through
the different ins and outs of the
cooling solution in a way that would
keep the temperature sort of uniform
around the tubes the plastic and keep
the liquid at the temperature that it
should be which is under sixty degrees
Celsius so that's mostly been improved
unfortunately this means that the
performance has not really changed to be
fair it's hard to make performance any
better with a liquid cooler when you're
working with this form factor but you're
not there's no reason to expect
significant off lift in performance
versus say an H 100 IB 2 which is the
predecessor to this one
and the H 100 iv1 before that before
getting into some of the thermals and
stuff like that another quick
explanation of what's going on with
those names so the H 100 I the v2
version was basically the offspring of
an IP issue intellectual property issue
with the radiator specifically as far as
we understand it so H 100 v1 had a
slightly different radiator than H 100
IV - that's the difference and then H
400 IPRO the one we're looking at today
is the gen 6 pump and that's all that's
different there so if you have an H 100
I already and it's working fine there's
no reason to even consider this but if
you don't have a liquid cooler then
that's where our testing comes in and it
might be worth your consideration the H
100 I Pro is 120 bucks so it's
continuing the trend of more expensive
coolers in the Gen 6 Department it's
most closest competition would be
something like page 115 the H 159 -
their product so of course there's 280
CLC from Gen 5 ace attack poms is about
five dollars more than this one which is
a 240 CLC it's got to 120 fans and
that's something we'll be talking up
more towards the conclusion we look at
the value proposition of everything so
let's get into the thermals we're gonna
start with pump speed thermals and look
at how the pump speed impacts it this
cooler has three options if unless you
want to customize it it's silent
balanced and full performance and then
it also technically is one of the first
Corsair or the first Corsair H series
cooler that has a zero rpm mode and all
that means is that under low loads the
fans won't spin if you allow it to do
that so that's it's not that special it
means that it'll be quieter when idle
basically and then when the liquid
temperatures tick to a certain point or
the CPU temperature takes to a certain
point it'll kick the fans on but other
than that it's another H 100 T's cooler
so let's go through the thermals for the
pump speed and for the stock pace
application versus our own application
as always for testing methodology check
the link in the description below for
the full article where we define how we
test these coolers the pump speed
thermals are up first the best way to
look at pump speed impact on temperature
is to plot the temperature chart over
time rather than using our steady-state
charts plotted against time the full
speed and balance speed pump settings
equate one another one idle generally at
around six to eight degrees celsius
delta T over ambient whereas the silent
pump speed sits closer to 10 to 11
degrees over ambient as the workload
ramps and cools part of our test shows
how well the equals can soak thermal
changes we see the balanced and silent
pump speeds perform roughly equally plus
or minus one degree of each other the
full speed test is consistently cooler
at times by as much as four to five
degrees this is the entirety of the
difference generally speaking these fans
at 100% speed are moving fast enough to
deal with the heat without needing the
extra help from a pump there is a
difference but it tends to be in
heaviest load periods and only on the
order of four to five degrees the pump
itself is inaudible over the fans in
this configuration but a particularly
whiny pump which sometimes happens in
normal manufacturing variants might have
audible frequency noise
that are up pitched versus the normal
lower hum if that's the case drop it
into balanced speed will help minimize
these noises but won't give a ton of
performance up noise normalize testing
is next this helps us evaluate the
overall efficiency of the cooler and
look at how good it is at cooling when
considering the fans at the same noise
level so by normalizing the noise to 40
DBA for all coolers tested we're able to
kind of kick out the coolers that are
only chart-topping by nature of having
50 or 60 DBA pads which is kind of
cheating because no one's really gonna
run them at that noise level to begin
with so we equate the noise to 40 DBA
for all coolers tested here and at a
match noise level we can then compare
the fan quality and pump quality without
worrying about whether or not the
coolers are sort of cheating with high
noise fans so let's get into those and
see how well this one does at 40 DBA
when compared to its predecessor and
some of its competitors the coarser h100
I Pro at 40 dB a required roughly 15 50
rpm fans fees for total system noise
lending the cooler right around where
the previous coarser h100 iv2 performed
the H 100 IB 2 is near enough to the H
100 I pro that were bordering margin of
error but just outside of it as we found
previously the new ASA tech Gen 6 pump
is slightly anemic when compared to Gen
5 there's not a huge difference and that
manifests itself in marginal more or
less immeasurable performance loss
theoretically this is matched with
endurance improvements but that will
require years of user experience to
really prove the EVGA a CL c 240 is a
bit cooler at 40 dB a somewhat within
the differences of Gen 5 and Gen 6 when
combined with other variants and fan
differences h 100 pro isn't doing
anything particularly impressive in this
benchmark but also isn't awful to be
fair it's just fine and that's about it
the cooler isn't offensive in its
performance but it's also not exciting
flatout thermal testing places the H 100
I Pro fairly far down the charts when
left with the stock paste application by
default ASA Tech's compound is well
applied but doesn't cover the entire IHS
or cold plate this reduces thermal
performance particularly on large heat
spreaders that are found on X 99 or X
299 CPUs completely stocked but at fall
fan and pump speeds the H 100 I Pro
performs that
41 degrees over ambience placing it near
the X 42 140 millimeter cooler after
applying paste manually as always we
manually apply a layer of paste across
the entire IHS for our tests unless
otherwise stated and that does happen
sometimes and that's where our
performance Delta comes in the
difference is that we wanted to
demonstrate stock versus manual
application for this round just to keep
it interesting
manually applied the cooler puts us
closer to 38 degrees which is just shy
of the original h100 IB to some of this
is test variance and we aren't that far
out of the range for error margins while
the rest is attributable to two things
one is fan RPMs these are 100 rpm slower
on this particular unit which is within
the 10% variance for fan manufacturing
and the other thing is some reduction in
performance attributable to a stag's
pump this level of performance has the H
100 I Pro near the H 150 I at 40 DBA
the X 72 with a silent pump both of
which are 360 coolers and the 280 x LC
at 1,400 rpm in terms of flat-out
performance noise levels the H 100 I Pro
landed at around 2400 rpm for its peak
fan rpm and as usual again there's about
10% variance so yours may be faster or a
bit slower these speeds had it slightly
slower than the H 100 IV to be tested
resulting in a proportional reduction in
noise levels h 100 IV - operated at 54
DBA output at max fan RPMs with the H
100 I pro at about 51 DBA this has it
comparable to the Kraken X 72 at full
speed x' which is a three fan cooler and
similar to some maxed out 280 coolers as
usual you may adjust the fan speeds down
to fit better performance or noise
levels that your build targets just
depends on what you're looking for so at
120 bucks the scene is a pretty tough
sell to be completely honest of course
there's our own h 100 IV - is 105
dollars and the EVGA CLC 280 which is a
pretty good performer but not really a
looker is 110 dollars the H 115 I is
$125 and that's another corsair product
and one that we've actually pretty
highly recommended so at five dollars
more really might as well get the H 159
not the 115 I Pro that costs
proportionately more than this one but
the old-school 115 I if you can find it
if you're really looking for the
things that this includes which is the
ability to spin down to zero rpm and I
guess more LEDs then it's a five-dollar
difference the fans are smaller the
noise is higher so if those things are
okay with you I guess it's worth it for
that specific set of features but for
the most part $120 is just simply too
much for a 240 millimeter cooler when
considering how many options that are on
the market just looking at other Asian
tech coolers not even considering people
like enter macs or silverstone people
here's a politic or dinah Tron or any of
the other vendors cool it just looking
at ASA tech you've got the older Kraken
models that are still somewhat
affordable if you can find them a better
choice would be something like Corsairs
older models the H 100 IV 2 which is 105
bucks EVGA is models the CLC 280 which
EVGA is signed for they're cheap because
they're trying to establish a foothold
in the market even though it's the same
overall quality of cooler and then again
the 115 I at 125 bucks so the cooler
that the h1 are I Pro here it's fine
there's nothing really wrong with it but
it's not improved enough over the h1 100
IB 2 to really drive purchases unless
you're looking for those few new
features which is LEDs and the ability
to spend down to zero rpm when not under
any reasonable load and that you could
do through other means if you really
wanted to anyway so those are the
options that uh that you've got I guess
not the most impressive cooler on the
market but hopefully some of the other
testing has given you some a good look
at performance for pump speeds and
performs for thermal paste application
the only thing here that really deserves
one more note is although it's not a
great value the $120 is too much for the
performance the performance overall is
okay so if this cooler comes down and
price to say 105 dollars like the
predecessor then that's perfectly fine
by the H 100 IV 2 is actually a really
good buy at its price and it's only
overshadowed by a couple of 280 C LCS so
if this comes down in price we're
perfectly happy with it right now it's
just a bit too much for 90% of the
market but if you're in the 10%
wants the new features go for it there's
nothing really screamingly wrong with it
