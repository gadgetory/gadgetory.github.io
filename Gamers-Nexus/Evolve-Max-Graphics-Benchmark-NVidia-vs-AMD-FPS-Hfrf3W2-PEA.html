nexus dotnet and this benchmark looks at
evolve and its performance using various
video cards on our test bench so I
already have a video up showing evolve
at max graphics settings if you're
curious you can check that out on the
channel we tested evolve using tube
settings effectively very high with SMA
a 2x applied and then medium with all
default medium settings applied and both
of these settings were used on all the
video cards in the tests ranging from
the 750 ti all the way up to the GTX 980
sadly the 970 was not available for this
bench and ranging from the 250 x all the
way up to the 290x including the r9 285
on AMD side so those are that's our
hardware and those are our settings in
terms of performance the game is really
it's not too crazy graphically it looks
pretty good but it's really not
introducing anything groundbreaking in
terms of oscillation or shading effects
or fog or dynamic particle effects or
anything of that nature it does look
good though at very high settings
performance with a GTX 980 sits at
around 100 26 FPS average making it more
than playable our baseline playable
target is about 60 FPS for best fluidity
GTX 980 over 100 FPS 7 80 85 FPS that's
about where the 970 will sit even though
there's not a 970 on this bench just
look at the GTX 780 that's about where
it be there are 9 290x is andys first
card to appear toward the top of the
bench that is at 72 FPS average with the
r9 285 significantly more affordable by
the way in the two to three hundred
dollar range sitting at 64 FPS and then
after that it's sort of budget and
mid-range cards at the 7850 750 ti 250x
range you're really not going to be
playing this game too well you could
probably you can make a 7850 two
gigabyte card work on low settings but
you should not currently be expecting to
play the game with a 750 ti or lower for
my video or similar from AMD it's just
not going to happen at a high frame rate
it'll work it's going to be a little bit
jarring though because this game at
30fps does not play well you kind of
want
i er because of the way the camera moves
and the rapid action side by the player
characters so that's sort of what looks
like I'm very high I'll open up the
medium benchmark here so you can check
that out as far as video cards you
should really be kind of hold your
budget for a little bit because there is
something coming soon we have tested it
with this game and it works well so hang
on to your budget if you're buying
specifically for this game check the
site you know toward the end of the week
and you'll find out more as far as cards
that exist now that we would recommend
if you're playing at settings that are
closer to very high you probably want to
look into the GTX 970 as your baseline
nvidia card and the r9 270x as your
baseline AMD card the 285 is a very good
sweet spot performer and a two thirty to
fifty dollar price range so i definitely
recommend considering that card as for
nvidia the 970 is pretty unbeatable
right now and that's really all I can
really speak to with NVIDIA so that's
all for this benchmark check the link in
the description below for more
information let me know if you have any
questions just tweeted at us at gamers
Nexus I can reply to that much easier
than I can reply to YouTube comments
please subscribe if you like this video
and want to see more benchmarks as the
game ship I do all of them and I will
see you all next time peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
