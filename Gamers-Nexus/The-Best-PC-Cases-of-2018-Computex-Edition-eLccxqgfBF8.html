2018 we've now rounded up what we think
are the best cases from the show with
either the most interesting design
elements or the best price points with
the innovations present as always wait
until we can review these cases before
getting too hyped or pre-ordering but we
wanted to at least bring attention to
the best cases coming out probably for
the next year before that this video is
brought to you by EVGA and the X 299
dark motherboard for the Intel high-end
desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is one of
the only motherboards on the market with
proper vrm cooling we've tested this and
found significant performance increase
over those without active cooling on the
BRMS this board was used in our recent
attempts to set a top-10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x29 dark at the link in the description
below our best cases roundup starts with
the finalized version of Leanne Lee's o
11 air which we originally saw at CES
2018 the air use is the same tone as the
O 11 dynamic a case co-designed by Dare
Bauer and Lian Li and the O 11 air is
the one we've always been the most
interested in of the two as it aims to
include three fans for a $130 version or
six fans for 150 to 160 dollar price
point the O 11 air is a highly
competitive enclosure at its target at
price point and has unique features like
dual PSU support or swappable hard drive
cages if you prefer that and it's also
got a compartmentalized layout we found
the original xi dynamic to be easy to
build in of good proportions and of
excellent performance when tuning for
the fan mounts present the air will
allow for fan mounts on the sidewall the
front the top and the bottom Lian Li is
going for a high quality build material
and high ventilation focus with airflow
through its grille design we're
interested to review this one as soon as
it's in and we found the OL of an air to
be the best in showcase for Computex
2018 Rio Toros Morpheus case aims to be
a resizable case which it claims will
allow a single case with semi modularity
for deployment and micro ATX ATX and EA
TX systems the enclosure isn't finalized
yet and Rio Toro comprised mostly of
former Corsair employees is looking for
our audience feedback if you have any
presently the case can fit EI TX at max
height and micro ATX or ATX at the
minimum height the motherboard is
installed an inverted layout fan count
is looking like one included RGB fan
with potential for an 80 millimeter fan
that we don't encourage this particular
decision and everything else is still up
in the air the case can fit two hundred
and eighty millimeter radiators
presently in the front or bottom and can
fit just an 80 millimeter fan in the
rear Rio Toro is also considering a 200
millimeter fan mount in the front which
should be achievable as the tooling is
completely custom the case uses
interlocking front back and side panels
for its resizable feature and the
locking mechanisms are still being
finalized but the panels should slide on
Rails to achieve the desired height
release is looking like quarter for
Coolermaster had a few cases to show
this year as we Illustrated it in
another video on the channel but we
thought the H 500 was the most
interesting for its market positioning
the case will ship with mesh as the
default configuration with an acrylic
panel as a swappable option and it aims
to bring down a smaller version of the H
500 P mesh a case that we highly praised
to the $100 price point for a 50 dollar
price cut this is an excellent way to
offer more budget minded builders a
similar case to what we think is the
flagship H 500 P case the H 500 mesh
it's still shipping with 2 200
millimeter RGB fans a mesh front and
will be slightly downsized with a few
features removed given the price drop we
think this is worth keeping an eye on
for our future reviews as an honorable
mention the coolermaster also had the SL
600 M on show this one will get some
design revisions that will improve the
top panel exhaust cover in the future
namely by offering a slightly raised
position for better exhaust ventilation
users can also remove the panel to
expose mesh if you're wondering why the
panel on the front is closed it's
because the bottom has substantial
distance from the ground and it's got
two 200 millimeter bottom intake fans
it's a callback to the RV zero two in
someways case also has a silenced focus
hence it's blocked off front and back
panels but more on this one later
Cougars Gemini ax was the most
interesting showing from this particular
company the case fits two simultaneous
systems one mini ITX and one full ATX
and can be laid on its side or
positioned upright dual system cases are
always interesting if less practical
and we think the Gemini acts at least
deserves to be noticed
even if briefly and that's because of
the price there will be no included fans
of the Gemini X trying to drive down
price of it relying instead on users to
provide their own and radiator support
goes up to 240 millimeters on the top
and bottom of the ATX side air flow is
oriented top to bottom with paneling
featuring four millimeter thick aluminum
and five millimeter thick glass that is
where the price comes in at nine hundred
dollars and it's available in quarter
three or four if you feel like you have
the money Rajyam tech also had a few
interesting enclosures but we thought
the rising tech affion and Ophion Evo
MITx cases were the most noteworthy the
OFI on will ship at $100 or $200 for the
Evo version and will be made of custom
tooling with perforated finishes on
these side panels ventilation looks
potentially decent on these as the
tempered glass panels were only here for
show
Rison tech also had a massive case on
display capable of fitting four to five
480 millimeter radiators depending on
final concept this is the any okay's
Annie ATX to life that is less practical
than any other one on this list of thus
far but at least it's interesting
Silverstone's SG 14 might sound like a
familiar case the company attempted to
launch this years ago but never managed
to bring it to market
since then silverstone has completely
refactored the case to the point of even
flipping it to serve as the LD 0-3 mini
ITX mini tower that we looked at
recently the SG 14 is small ultra
lightweight and will target a 30 to 40
dollar price point the case leans on
mesh for air flow that remains true to
the small form-factor format as a budget
option the SG 14 looks promising for
small portable home theater PC builds
and it's thermal should perform
reasonably provided the user installs a
decent cooling solution we also wanted
to point out the CS 381 by silverstone
this one isn't a traditional case but
we're hoping to use it in one of our own
upcoming server builds the 381 is a 10
bay Mini server enclosure capable of
fitting at micro ATX motherboards for
specialized use cases for our own we'd
like to populate the box with the drives
and a cup a thread ripper or i9 CPU for
inbox video compression and dual 120
memory fans are supported as side intake
but could be sacrificed instead for two
more 3.5 inch
drives it's a small efficient nast
replacement and this would allow us to
host more drives than most nasty
enclosures plus enable 10 Gigabit
Ethernet via a motherboard or a IC a bit
cheaper than an ass their own takes at
level 20 VT is the final case here the
level 20 series has been reimagined for
lower end cases pulling the halo
products visuals into a more affordable
price class of the three new level 20
enclosures shown we were the most
interested in the level 20 VT the case
is more looks focused than function
focused as we discussed in another video
but it does a good job of bringing down
a high-end look to the $100 price point
the level 20 VT shows a renewed focus by
the industry on accommodating M ATX
users and offers a case that prioritizes
it looks provided that the user relies
upon liquid cooling we think this box
deserves a spot on the list for serving
a different market of an already
underserved audience and that's it for
our case round up for this year's
computex 2018 show as always
