hardcore overclocking and this will be a
sort of very general a.m. for
motherboard roundup and we're gonna
start right at the top of the price
points with the well with the three
hundred and fifty dollar crosshair six
extreme before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator plus three 120 fans
that are RGB illuminated if then we'll
take it ring fans at that this is a 4.5
done a stack pump which one of the
faster pumps you can learn more at the
link in the description below here's the
problem with the crosshair six extreme
the crosshair six hero exists and
basically what happened when they made
the extreme is they took a hero they
made it a bit wider as you can see the
you know your screw holes finished right
here instead like you have a screw hole
right there and then the board still
extends past that which the crosshair
six hero doesn't do but the crosshair
six extreme basically uses that extra
width to tack on a million fan headers
like it has a ton of fan headers
slightly to let relay out the
overclocking features like the start
button post code reset switch island to
jumper lnto mode 2 jumper slow mode
switch our SVD switch voltage read
points retry button safe boot bus and
all of these are located in a better
part of the like are better laid out in
my opinion they're in a better position
more accessible more usable but
ultimately ignoring you know the our SVD
switch which the our SVD switch is
exclusively for ln2 overclockers it's
not like it doesn't literally could not
matter less to anybody else on the
planet then Alan to over like and even
if you're an Ellen to overclock or the
our SVD switch is not all that useful
like it is handy but you can do like you
can make do without it it's not
absolutely necessary it does make things
a bit simpler though
the the thing is that this literally is
just sort of a feature relay out it does
get some extra handle to support it does
get a lot a lot of extra fan headers it
does get a vrm upgrade the this is a
still the same eight plus four phase
arrangement
it's just 60 amp international rectifier
power stages instead of 40 amp dual and
fats know that you can actually see them
under the heat sinks but you know not
that different both of them are like the
crosshair six hero is very overkill for
isin the crosshair six extreme is more
overkill for Eisen in fact the crosshair
six extreme has one of the strongest
like is literally in terms of current
capability one of the strongest VRMs on
on am four there's only one other
motherboard that matches it for current
throughput capability but you know it's
like you get all the same buttons and
switches except the our SVD on the hero
that you do on the sakes on the extreme
and the hero is a hundred bucks less so
the extreme really doesn't make a lot of
sense even for extreme overclockers so
this thing has a ridiculously strong vrm
and that's the only good thing about it
by far you know this is a 12 phase using
40 amp duel and fats from texas
instruments so same MOSFETs as what
you'd find on the crosshair six hero
there's just twice well fifty percent
more of them in the v core section so
the vrm on this thing is ridiculously
strong the problem is the rest of the
motherboard kinda isn't I have the
Taichi the memory overclocking is not
great you know I mean for daily it's
doable it's just there's a lot of other
motherboards out there which do it
better a lot better and the BIOS general
it like you know you have a lot of
settings you have a lot of options but I
can hit the same clocks on other boards
that don't have those up
at all and I can hit those same clocks
on motherboards that cost a lot less so
you know this thing it doesn't carry
itself like it doesn't have some killer
feature that may justifies that two
hundred and fifty dollar price point
unless you consider having the most
powerful vrm that you will never ever
ever ever ever get close to using at
full capacity a killer feature like you
know yeah it does have the the nicest
vrm of all the rise in motherboards it's
just too bad that everything else on the
board is kind of mediocre in my pain for
like everything else on the boards is
kind of mediocre which to the daily user
I think that's more handy and even for
the extreme overclocker the Taichi and
the professional gaming both lack a few
settings that are kinda necessary for
liquid-nitrogen overclocking and just in
general on ln2 the tai chi is really
badly behaved in fact it's completely
like it was a complete catastrophe when
I tried it so I'm actively looking for a
replacement motherboard for my ex 370
Taichi because I can't use it on liquid
nitrogen because it just doesn't work so
yeah a strong vrm you know can certainly
complement a motherboard it doesn't make
a board it can break one this is the
same PCB as the professional gaming it
leaves you know I really I honestly
wouldn't recommend like I wouldn't buy
them like I bought the Tai Chi I
wouldn't buy it again is where I'm with
it and same goes for the professional
gaming especially at two hundred and
fifty dollars you can just go buy the
crosshair six hero sure the vrm is
weaker but the rest of the board is a
lot better so yeah moving on I think the
best in the two hundred dollar sort of
200 to 250 dollar price range the best
balance I think would probably be of
sort of price features VRM overclocking
support is probably the ax
a X 370 gaming k7 and there's a very
good reason for this while I have the X
370 gaming k5 which is the stripped down
version of this as in it lacks quite a
lot of the like this board like the k5
is really good at memory overclocking
the k7 takes everything that's good
about the k5 and puts a much better vrm
on it a better BIOS and fixes a lot of
the problems I have with the k5 which
means the k7 is like I especially at you
know 210 dollars it's a killer board in
my opinion absolutely killer because you
get my the best clock gen a rise in
motherboard could possibly have the you
know the clock gen is a necessary
feature on a rising motherboard for BC
LK overclocking which really isn't that
handy to most people but if you want BC
LK overclocking done right gigabyte has
it the best because they go the the
clock gen on these boards goes to one
one hundredths of a megahertz which is
just like completely insane levels of
like accuracy kind of actually
completely pointless levels of accuracy
cuz you're never gonna need to fine-tune
the the CPU clock that much or the
memory clock of that much but it you
know it's nice to have the option I
personally only use it at like tenth of
a megahertz increments not the full
hundredth range but it's nice to have
the option the board also has dual BIOS
so if your BIOS flash goes wrong the
board will literally just trying to turn
the board on will reek will recover a
bad BIOS flash it has a clear bias
button it has a power button and reset
button and a postcode admittedly they
put the postcode in the wrong place you
know down on the bottom edge but it's
still there
and honestly with the k5 I didn't find
myself needing a postcode so you know
it's a really good mix of overclocking
features on this board really really
good makes and you still get you know
you don't get a particularly strong
you get a six phase well a six plus four
phase with six phases for recore using
international rectifier 3553 s which are
40 amp hour stages so as far as the you
know $200 plus motherboards go this is
definitely the weakest vrm and even if
you go a little bit below $200 yeah this
well actually now now there's one
motherboard that has a worst vrm it's
called the X 370 X power and it's made
by MSI but the this you know this is
literally barely above what the MSI can
do and you know it's still it's not
gonna limit you and overclocking it just
means that the vrm on this thing tends
to run a bit warm especially because the
vrm heatsink isn't that great but the
rest of the board like I personally I
feel the rest of the board more than
makes up for the anemic well it's not
anemic it's just not very like you know
the vrm could still be better it could
certainly have a better heatsink but uh
it's not like it's gonna stop you from
hitting 4 gigahertz if your chip is
capable of hitting 4 gigahertz it's just
gonna do 4 gigahertz while running
slightly warmer so you know that's kind
of that and personally I think I that is
a trade I'd be willing to make because
at this price point your only other real
option is the Strix
X 370 - eff board or the Tai Chi which
we've already went over the Tai Chi in
my opinion is not fun to overclock on it
complains too much too often and you
know I guess for if you're doing some
very mild overclocking and not doing too
much fine tuning you're not gonna
complain but basically the moment I with
the Tai Chi the moment I go below like C
L 16 the board just keeps failing to
post all the time and it's infuriating
because going below like doing 34 it
like 3466 CL 16 works 3466
CLS
14 doesn't work unless I've booted 3466
CL 16 before which you know it's just
like it only bored I have that does that
the Tai Chi and I find that kind of like
that's a bit of a deal and that in my
opinion is a complete deal-breaker
other than the k7 your option is the
Strix ex 370 - eff the thing is this
loses the postcode it loses the buttons
it doesn't have to a while it does still
have a clock chin it doesn't go as it's
not as granular it does have a lot
stronger vrm this uses 60 amp
international rectifier power stages and
it has six phases for vcore so this is
like the second highest motherboard in
terms of peak erm current capability
this is you know is this thing strong so
if you want a great VRM and you know
don't mind losing things like a postcode
and the buttons and I do believe the k7
is actually regarded as the best memory
overclocking motherboard for m4 as of
right now if you don't mind losing some
of the overclocking ability capabilities
that the the k7 may offer this is a
really strong option which I I think for
the casual user this is probably that
this would probably be the best and you
do save 20 bucks over the k7 on that so
you know goes either way personally as a
you know more advanced overclocker
I would buy the k7 but if I was doing a
build for a friend and I would never
ever have to see the system again I
wouldn't mind using the X 370 to uh you
know the Strix X 370 - F either so both
very very you know both nice boards I
just kind of like the feature set of the
X 370 k7 better than the X 370 - eff
moving on well we kind of hit a dead
zone here between between the straight
and the well this and there's a very
simple reason alt for that okay the vrm
on this that well all the MSI boards
like this vrm is terrible
well it's not terrible it's just not
great this one's not great this one's
not great like none of these is
particularly impressive and they all
cost more than this which the thing
about the you know the the okay the
thing about the X 370 - Pro is you get
your Texas Instruments 40 amp duel and
that's the same MOSFETs you would find
on the crosshair 6 here oh except now
there's six of them instead of eight of
them so you don't get a huge vrm
downgrade it's still plenty for
overclocking risin it's you know it's
roughly on par in fact with like the
gigabyte gaming k7 arguably but you do
lose a lot of features on this
motherboard again no dual BIOS no
buttons no postcode but you do get a
strong of erm there's also no clock
general in this thing so you know if you
want to strongly RM at a budget well at
a lower cost because we're really not in
the budget range according to most
people I'd honest personally I consider
100 and thought the $30.00 a budget
motherboard because once you go below
this price point the boards start
getting really really bad really really
quick as literally like the motherboard
manufacturer just start accessing
features and well quality left right and
center in order to try fit the you know
the really low price points but this is
a this is a really strong board this is
like probably the last thing I would
consider using in terms of vrm quality
for a daily build though honorable
mention if you if you don't mind having
a anemic for phase vrm with a inadequate
heatsink on it this thing has a real
like keeps the k7s clock gen
and it has troubleshooting LEDs no
postcode no buttons it does have dual
BIOS and it does have the really really
strong clock you know the clock gent is
really really nice on this thing I
really like this board for everything
except the vrm and then there's the X
370 where I like the vrm but I don't
really like the rest of the board so you
know at this price point you can sort of
swing between these two moving further
down the motherboard line up this is a
really popular board with a lot of
people but you see this and that and
this has a real like 40 amp dual end
fits from Texas Instruments six-phase
and that's a 4 and an anaemic for phase
at that like this has a VR I'm roughly
on par with what you find on the
gigabyte gaming k5 so yeah and it
doesn't really like it doesn't add
anything there's no clock gen there's no
post codes or buttons or yeah so you
know if you're considering this board
buy that one but let's move out of the
120 dollar range and into the garbage
bin okay it's not quite that bad but
we're getting there so here's the
problem I see with a lot of these boards
right here at this price point right
these are all around a hundred bucks for
24 well okay well as for 30 bucks more
you can have a way better motherboard
than any of these you know like these
have all of these boards down here need
a significant amount of airflow over the
vrm if you want to run an overclocked
eight core and you know that's just
that's just the way it is and if you
move up to this thing you wouldn't need
to worry about that as much because this
actually has like this has a proper good
six phase all of these are anemic for
phase designs
this is technically not an anaemic for
phase design but the heatsink on that
vrm is terrible and similar goes for
this one oh and this one doesn't even
have a heatsink so don't touch that with
a ten-foot pole because well you know if
the boards with the heatsink
need a lot of airflow how much airflow
do you think the boards without one need
when they use the exact same MOSFETs in
the exact same phase counts
they just didn't bother to put a
heatsink on those yeah not great really
not great
this thing's 90 bucks and well this this
board gets an honorable mention for
being like of the terrible V RMS this is
the least terrible it looks like a six
phase it's not a six phase it's a three
phase but it has a lot of MOSFETs and
it's honestly not that bad it's just
also not great at least it gets a
somewhat decent looking heatsink so this
could be an option for a budget
motherboard and its derivatives which
it's derivative would be well it's
sibling this the ABB 350 pro 4 same vrm
different color scheme and the a/b 350m
pro 4 same the RM different color scheme
it's still that you know I am totally
not a I am totally a six phase except
running off of a three phase voltage
controller with no doubling scheme
whatsoever so it's a three but the extra
components do mean that the V arm has
slightly better thermal characteristics
but yeah you kind of end up like with
these boards like the ones with the heat
sinks it's like you got to be prepared
to throw airflow at all of these and
then when you get to the boards with no
heat sinks like this thing it's just
don't even try like honestly I wouldn't
even stick an 1800 X on this like at
stock
I wouldn't take an 1800 X put it into
this board and run it at stock settings
because that vrm has no heat sync those
MOSFETs are rated for 105 degree well no
the MOSFETs are fine well actually they
probably won't be
so this vrm because it has no heatsink
I've I have a board with well actually a
better version of this and she's
depressing cuz okay well just know this
is terrible okay so Asus has a similar
four phase design to this it except it
has two low side MOSFETs per phase here
you have one low side MOSFET per space
so basically the low side is gonna be
dissipating roughly twice as much heat
and even on the four phase design with
two low side MOSFETs this vrm design
gets really hot when you run an eight
core and that's with a heatsink
without a heatsink this is gonna end
with you know the lowered fate MOSFET
count this is gonna be hitting well over
a hundred and twenty degrees
no problem even with like an 1800 exit
stock and you know what the funny though
what the problem with that is MOSFETs at
120 are fine the bigger issue is that
you know you have these capacitors right
here and also right here and those are
all rated for a hundred and five degrees
centigrade and only for 5000 hours at
that temperature level also all of these
capacitors on this board are made in
Taiwan they're not Japanese you know in
case you actually cared about that
because the our rating and the
temperature rating doesn't give it away
that you know if the if this area of the
board hits 120 then the capacitors are
gonna be going well over a hundred and
five unless you have a significant
amount of airflow over the board so just
know just know like be 350 boards with
no vrm heat sinks well at least this
isn't be 350 but there are be 350 boards
with no vrm heat sinks and those like
like this this okay well here we have
the the version with all the extra
MOSFETs and the this still completely no
it's a be 350 Ward so it technically
supports overclocking but I wouldn't
overclock anything other than a quad
core on this because this VR
has no heatsink and even with the
quad-core I'd be very concerned about
those MOSFETs and the capacitors
especially the capacitors because those
are a lot more temperature sensitive
than the actual MOSFETs you know right
next to them so yeah if it doesn't have
a heatsink just don't just just ignore
that it exists uh terrible terrible
boards but hey at least they're cheap so
yeah that's that's pretty much it for
all the m4 motherboards that are
currently available
you know ignoring the whole gap of you
know basically this from from the tight
between the tai chi and the and the k5
it's just kind of ignore all of that
also ignore this thing because this this
board right here at one hundred and
thirty dollars uses the same four plus
two phase v RM design that you would
find on way let me find it well it's
this v RM that one yeah this board has
the same v RM as that board you know so
yeah there's and that's X 370 versus B
350 but ultimately like what chipset the
manufacturers stick on the board doesn't
matter what matters is well what they
decide to do to the v RM and in this
case they decided that they wanted to
make a crap one whereas this one that
this one is actually good though this
one's on a really steep discount which
yeah it just means once this thing is
back at normal price you're kind of like
you kind of end up with motherboards
that all need a lot of airflow it's just
yeah you're you're gonna need a lot of
erm airflow and there's no getting
around that at the 120 down price points
so yeah that's it all of the a well
pretty much all of the m4 motherboards
covered hopefully this stops you from
buying a motherboard that'll die in a
year or two
well stop
from buying a motherboard that's
completely inadequate or for
overclocking and killing it because
that's probably what would happen but
yeah that's it
