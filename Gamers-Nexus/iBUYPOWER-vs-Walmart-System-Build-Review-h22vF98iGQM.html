that a lot of you look at system
integrators a little differently or more
likely exactly the same after we began
our Walmart system review we put in a
last-minute rush order for an iWeb power
rdy or ready system with a significantly
better parts than what we could get in
the Walmart built this was before Linus
had begun his series too and so all we
knew was that the parts listing included
a 9700 K instead of Walmart's 8700
clearly an improvement and an RT X 2080
instead of a 1080 TI while being a lower
price the question was whether or not
the assembly was any good and if any
other mistakes were made along the way
before that this video is brought to you
by mass drop in the PC 37 X gaming
headset with professional-grade
Sennheiser noise cancelling microphone
the PC 37 X headsets are what we use in
the office for phone interviews where
audio and mic quality are critical
making it very convenient high
performance solution for gaming or
professional work the headphones come
with a detachable ten-foot cable for
safe storage during travel a standard
3.5 millimeter plug and soft foam 4 firm
but comfortable fit over the ears
learn more at the link in the
description below before starting on
this one quick trip down memory lane we
had originally ordered the Walmart
system in November around Black Friday
and that was supposed to be a 2000 plus
dollar build with taxes about 2200 I
think that was an 80 709 k it was
supposed to be a 1080i we didn't get
that we end up with a $1,500 build but
before we got the Walmart system in what
we did was also placed an order with i/o
power for one of their ready systems so
this is something that was actually
going to go to a customer it was on the
floor
it was a pre-built system with ask you
specific SKU so it wasn't a customized
one and I'm a power pulled it off the
line and sent it to us and it was the
same experience you'd get as a customer
which is evidenced by the fact that the
same mistakes existed in here as a
customer would receive and we'll talk
about those more in a moment and this is
all before the I think before Linus
released some of his series but also
before we released our Walmart video so
this is we were like just completely
blind to what we were getting into at
this point what we ended up with with
the Walmart system what
in 87 100 GTX 1070 is about a $1,500 SKU
the prices on those skis have dropped by
several hundred dollars for each one
since then and our system also had an h3
10 motherboard just probably the the
most egregious fault out of the part
selection and so that's got slower DMI
it has one dimbo channel and the case
also was pretty bad it had literally
three to four millimeters of space
between the glass and the front and this
one is just in an NZXT case it's been
rebuilt a bit significantly more space
here even though it looks closed off it
actually does have a lot more space than
the Walmart one did so we thought you
know even though it's it's still pretty
closed off it can at least get some air
so maybe it'll be better and that's part
of what we're testing today and then
finally the Walmart system use glue hot
glue to hold the USB 3 cable and now I
rip our in there past has used glue as
well but they don't anymore so this is
this is a glue free system though horses
were used to make this system but in the
past I hope our did use hot glue it's
just they've moved on and progressed
whereas Walmart was just now figuring
that out that it's unnecessary so for
this one what we got was a 9700 K RT X
2080 and it was the correct system
delivered so check that box did that
properly there were mistakes in the
build and they were pretty significant
ones but we got what we ordered and the
parts are there and all the mistakes are
correctable is just you shouldn't have
to correct them as a customer which has
been obviously now a big point of
discussion with the lionesses series I
do want to give line of some credit here
because in speaking with the S eyes they
were all like like on the edge of their
seats of what's going to happen next so
in that series so we know that IB power
specifically made internal changes to
fix a lot of the things that line is
talked about which is great job well
done to Linus media group and job well
done to I hope our another sis for
listening this system is one of the last
ones that did not have the the
perspective of Linus's series to improve
from but it had other issues that Linus
didn't encounter there's special ones
that that we found and we reported back
to our power
they should be improved as well we still
wanted to go through them there so let's
let's start with a part selection quick
monologue before we get into this people
always like to posting comments whenever
anyone does a build media outlet doesn't
build Pawlik I'll do a build
sis do a build people always love to
post why didn't you use X part and there
are good reasons for that so let me just
point a few of those out for you s eyes
do not typically work with things like
for example noctua coolers you'll notice
here this is the NZXT m22 rebranded so
that I'm 22 is our least favorite liquid
cooler that we've reviewed and we think
is a waste of money for the consumer to
buy it now that doesn't mean I buy power
spending that same money on it doesn't
mean that you're spending the same money
on it you would retail when you buy
through an SI the reason for that is
pretty simple they get discount rates
they get either distribution pricing or
in the case of IR power it's literally
in the same building as NZXT this case
is in NZXT case that coolers in NZXT
cooler they come from next door
there is no logistical cost involved
beyond having someone push a box to the
warehouse adjacent to the NZXT one so
that reduces cost on these things
significantly and that's why you see
stuff like these partnerships where NZXT
case NZXT cooler now there other there
could be a in some instances MDF or
marketing Development Fund money
changing hands like Intel and the Nvidia
typically will run MDF for things like
include our chipset logo on your box or
include GeForce or the game bundle or
whatever in your system that's typically
accompanied by money in order to to help
sort of offset the cost to the
manufacturer to the SI when they sell it
to the consumer a lot of the time that
money's passed on to you so part
selection is all over the place and
sometimes you might just be like why is
only thousand watt power supply
available for this system that doesn't
need it well they probably had a lot of
them and got a good deal on it so
somebody keep in mind but let's go
through the parts choices and see how
they price it out and then we'll start
talking about our our testing results
and some of the issues we had when we
first requested this machine background
early December late November it would
have cost about twenty to thirty one so
two thousand two hundred thirty one
dollars u.s. that included the RT acts
9700 k all the other components in the
system and the assembly of course and
the warranty identical or similar parts
we're identical ones were unavailable
could be purchased for about 1986
dollars and that's if you bought it
yourself without any of the SIS
so strictly like for like ignoring that
you can yes get cheaper parts with
different names comparing the cost of
the same parts versus iBUYPOWER for DIY
this is really not a bad deal it's about
$200 overhead to build the system which
we think is fair you aren't being
overcharged to the components and if you
were to instead pick parts that run a
bit cheaper but produce the same quality
build you could definitely reduce the
price you get it done for about $1,800
somewhere around there so that's if
you're willing to do things like get a
cheaper GPU this this video card was
about $90 more expensive than go in with
a different r-tx 2080 you could also
reduce $20 on the cooler you could use
like an aqua and hu 14s instead of a
crack and I'm 22
I hope our doesn't necessarily have that
privilege and that you got a $30 change
and RAM drop in case price and stuff
like that so we did not factor when
there's 10 in here since it's basically
free now that would be another $100
value potentially if you do consider
that as a value add the difference is
that IRA power gets a lot of its chosen
parts for cheaper than we could so you
end up having to just use different
parts in order to drop the price and it
can be significant it's just at some
point you do pay for someone to assemble
it for you that's where we need to talk
about the assembly quality and the the
build itself because if you're paying
the premium maybe 200 bucks which we
think is pretty fair if you're paying
$200 or $400 in some cases more for an
SI to build your system it better be
good like everything has to be right and
it wasn't and before we get into the the
things that are very wrong on this I'll
note that I will power is correcting
these they start working on several of
the issues we found after Linus the
series we found a few more they're
working on those too so problems should
be resolved but let's go through them
anyway the target customer for this
system will plug their peripherals and
hit the power button and install steam
without ever needing to know what a BIOS
is so that's essentially what we did for
the first round of tests
for thermals we ran our standard case
testing suite we'll look at those
results momentarily and for general
performance we ran our CPU testing suite
the results from these tests are
absolutely not comparable to our
previously published CPU in case
benchmarks because different parts are
use we just use these because well it's
pretty standard testing so despite this
we couldn't resist making a sanity check
comparison between our previous 9700 KS
CPU testing results and the iBUYPOWER
system we can show some of those results
on the screen it just flashed through
them now you really only need to see a
versus B here in the process of doing a
9700 K standardized test with our very
controlled by us versus the iBUYPOWER
one we noticed something odd the IRA
power system was underperforming in a
way that reached beyond the expected
differences due to using a different GPU
motherboard or memory K so the
difference is far greater than what we
should have seen and treated BIOS
revealed one obvious cause all settings
had been set to default values so no XMP
was enabled and our thirty-two hundred
megahertz Khitan quotes there was
running at 20 666 - tech tips noted the
same mistake in their recent coverage of
an IE by power system but our problems
extended further than that and that's
thanks to an old friend
multi-core enhancement the board use in
our system was different than minuses
hours used in asus prime z 390 p with
the oldest publicly available bios
installed in this bios version setting
MCE to auto affects the CB of frequency
this in itself isn't bad we're not
trying to do a baseline cv benchmark
here and if i power wants to soft
overclock their systems then that's
their prerogative the problem is that
for whatever reason this old version of
MCE actually under clocks the 9700 k
locking it's a 3.8 gigahertz on all
cores under sustained load rather than
4.1 to 4.2 when MCE is manually disabled
that's a big difference in frequency and
impact performance significantly as you
saw in some of our our charts we flashed
through there were multiple ways for iva
power to avoid this problem selecting
XMP 2 and the asus bios brings up a
prompt that asks whether the user would
like to enable or disable MCE so the XMP
and MCE problems could both be solved by
toggling a single menu option something
that i've a power managed to somehow
overlooked also updating the BIOS
the most recent version not only fixed
MCE so that it behaved as expected 4.7
gigahertz on all cores under sustained
load but also disables MCE altogether if
Auto is chosen and we checked and newer
BIOS versions were available the BIOS
provision that was on here was from well
before we ordered the system like more
than a month so you know it's one thing
if you buy the ACC 390 P from Amazon get
it in a box and it's got the first
revision BIOS on it that's one thing
because that's probably been sitting on
a shelf since they ordered it this was
built by someone booted presumably and
then they they still overlooked it
so someone went through the process of
turning the theta on doing some basic
testing and nowhere in that process was
it noticed XMP is off ok that's one
problem and also the CPU doesn't boost
anywhere close to where it's supposed to
be so that's the bigger problem here and
like I said in fairness to IRI power the
company has put checks in place now to
try and prevent this in the future my
understanding is there's supposed to be
some more people on the line or at least
more senior people down there who are
overseeing things so we can't we can't
vouch to this but we've been told that
these processes have been now checked so
it shouldn't happen again but obviously
a very serious issue and one which is so
trivially resolved that it is almost
offensive so just just something to keep
in mind is that MCE was an additional
problem that I don't believe ltte ran
into so it's a something unique for us
on that one for the game results as we
sort of flashed by earlier it's pretty
obvious when something's wrong here far
cry 5 at 1080 P gives clear insight to
this problem the 9700 Kay review put the
CPU at 149 FPS average with the
out-of-the-box high power testing
landing us at 122 FPS average enabling
XMP and fixing the broken frequency
setting got us back up to 147 FPS
average on high power illustrating an
out-of-box a loss of about 17 percent we
saw similar results with GTA 5 at 1080p
where the stock result was 170 FPS
average with our 20 atti bench mind you
and the out of box high-power results
was 148 FPS average the updated system
did 163 FPS average that's another nine
percent decay in performance from a bad
configuration the thermal performance of
our power system
can't be directly compared against any
of our previous case reviews since the
components are completely different even
if they were similar the blower cooler
on the GPU and the CLC on the CPU are
completely different from our standard
case testing and for the Walmart
pre-built system we simply swapped out
the components so we put our normal case
test bench in the Walmart PC case and
that made it a valid comparison for this
one there was no point in doing that
because I buy power is just using a
nasty 40 elite that's been modified and
we've already reviewed that case the
initial CPU torture test at the
previously mentioned flawed stock
settings obviously e on XMB off etc
resulted in a delta T over ambience of
38.2 degrees Celsius which remains
effectively the same at 39.1 with the
GPU fan lock that 55% our control when
the CPU was set to proper clock speeds
temperatures rose slightly to 41 point
three degrees Celsius over ambience
these temperature Delta's results from
logged CPU temperatures in the low to
mid-60s mind you which is more than
reasonable for a system running a
sustained prime95 workload the specific
CLC design is one that we've reviewed
and were unimpressed by but the fact
remains that it's a liquid cooler and
it's able to overcome any of the issues
primarily by brute force GPU
temperatures are the most pertinent for
this review since the 2080 packed in our
system uses a relatively inexpensive
single fan blower cooler while even
nvidia branded cards have made the move
to dual fan coolers at stock settings
with the default fan curve the GPU
maintained a temperature of 60 degrees
Celsius that's over ambient and that's
warm it's also determined entirely by
the maximum temperature the card is
willing to maintain which is about 82 to
83 degrees Celsius the GPU fan leveled
out at a constant 42 percent speed to
stay at this temperature or roughly 1900
rpm the alterations to XMP and I'm ze
predictably had no significant effect on
GPU temperature which averaged again
forty eight point eight degrees so we
won't even bother plotting that one fire
strike was the last of the tests that we
bothered performing with the default GPU
fan curve GPU temperature average 56
point seven degrees Celsius over ambient
and it would almost definitely have
averaged between 55 and 60 degrees over
ambient in any test with a fully loaded
GPU since that was the target
temperature range so if you're playing
games you're gonna see about the same
here as you would in any meaningful game
that puts load on the GPU with fan
speeds locked GPU temperature was about
the same as it wasn't the torture test
48 point two degrees Celsius over a
means and then 49 point two with XMP MCE
changes we measured this system at forty
two point eight DBA for noise levels
which is definitely a bit loud the GP of
fan was locked to fifty five percent for
these because that's our standard
testing for cases but the system could
be much quieter with the fan allowed to
spin down the problem is that it gets
kind of hot then because it's a blower
fan if you want to see the noise as
compared to other cases with our
standardized testing you can check our
case reviews ideally the s340 elite
review or you can check the crack and
i'm 22 review if you want specific
numbers on specific components because
otherwise all we're doing right here is
just testing the entire system as a
whole because that's probably what
you're buying clearly a lot can be
improved then in the performance aspect
just by setting it up properly but part
selection build quality a kill
management is is fine
we had no complaints with it unlike the
Walmart system so significant
improvement over Walmart there the
problem is I hope ours not really
competing with Walmart anymore they're
competing with cyber power to some
extent being here in origin although
they are different price class but you
get the idea
zài tax people like that if you look at
this versus Walmart it is a massive
improvement despite they didn't still
being wrong so like I mean the
motherboard is a real motherboard it's
not a particularly good one it's the
cheapest even be 90 40 you can get but
it's not h3 10 so that's a big
improvement right there two sticks of
memory that don't suck that's another
big improvement they weren't at the
speed they should be thirty two hundred
megahertz but they can get to that speed
if you set it up properly and
theoretically will be in the future by
iWay power so it's it's faster memory
it's more competently you can
figured and barred selection there's
still things we would of course change
like I said cooler is not my favorite
but I hope our probably gets a pretty
big discount on those and we don't know
the details so it's really kind of hard
to criticize individual part selection
because we don't know what the deals are
but on the whole it's a significantly
better system it's really the takeaway
here is Walmart's build we would
consider to be incompetent that would be
a fair word to use for Walmart's Vil the
a310 with a that look like nearly half
the DMI or something speed it's it's one
dimple channel it's a garbage
motherboard vrm is terrible they put in
eighty seven hundred nine K in it for
the price that was very high single
memory stick and previous generation
video card and the margins were just
completely insane because again the
price has fallen about four hundred
dollars for some of those Walmart
systems so you know they were making way
too much money on them this is nothing
like that it is more or less than
component selections correct it's just
the configuration was wrong and well I
mean it should be fixed but until we see
it is yeah obviously be a bit careful
but that's gonna stand at this point for
for a lot of these a size they all seem
to have problems as we saw in - a series
so and that's it for this one the system
is unfortunately not quite as excited as
we thought we thought when we originally
did this godless system the plan was
you're getting this Walmart one in we
have pretty good an idea of how that
quality is let's get an incumbent sis
system in it and just show the disparity
between these people have done this for
decades they know what they're doing and
these people are just starting let's
show the difference and it just it
wasn't quite the the slam dunk that I
think IRA power
likely suspected because of these
mistakes so anyway fixes are in the
works and thank you for watching as
