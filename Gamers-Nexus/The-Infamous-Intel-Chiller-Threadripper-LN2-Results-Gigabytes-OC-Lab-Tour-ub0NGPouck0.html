Taiwan and this is high cookies lab so
if you don't have a huhai cookie is he's
I think it's fair to say the the main or
only overclocker had at gigabyte doing
an extreme overclocking hi cookie has
placed several high scores is a very
skilled overclocker and this is his lab
so we have to show off some cool stuff
like custom ellentube pots we have
deleted 31 75 X CPUs here as well and
then also the infamous chiller so today
we're going to walk through the lab show
off some of the really cool stuff here I
kick my toasty lab talk about some of
the more interesting our clocks and
tests going on and hopefully get into
some numbers for both AMD and Intel
systems on the higher frequency higher
frequency overclocks that high cookie
has pulled off before that this video is
brought to you by iFixit and the Manta
driver kit the iFixit Manta driver kit
is built out as a generalized tool for
repairs of all types but the focus on
game console repairs by including those
strange proprietary bits phone repair
bits laptop repair bits and more the
bent a driver kit includes try Wayne
bits spanners posit drive game bits
torch security bits and everything else
for general tech repair click the link
below to learn more so let's start with
the chiller the chiller is a highly
chiller and it's a quick correction here
I think our understanding from from one
of our sources earlier at Computex last
year was that Intel was running out
something like minus 20 degrees Celsius
for its chiller for the 31 35 X but I
think this actually does seven so seven
degrees Celsius for the chiller this is
the one that it's about a thousand watt
maximum power for the chiller and all
this tubing right here is the heavily
insulated tubing to run it so you just
run it through a water loop chill it
kind of like what we do for our
overclocked streams except way better
because we use ice so this is far more
efficient and this hooked up to the 31
75 X which ran at 5 gigahertz and I
think most of you know the story of that
one and then over here is a one of the
gigabyte X 599 motherboards and we'll
have more information on this to build
Zords working on it
PCB analysis for us that should be
really interesting so if you want to see
his analysis of the board so much that
the we did one for the Dominus and make
sure you subscribe and check back for
that but this is one of the the ex-59
nine boards that gigabytes working on it
has a a I guess development heatsink on
it so this is not the final heatsink we
can show a shot of the final heat sink
the final a mass production board as
well but this is high cookie set up on
the BRM with four fans that I think are
just running because it's easier for for
debugging purposes when doing the higher
over clocks on the CPU and I guess let's
show off let's show off this deleted one
too so this is and you may have seen
this when Roman did a deal it'd but this
is a 31 75 X D lated and this one is
special because if we flip it over on
the backside we have a scorch mark so I
think high cookie was it just that this
was running too high too much power so I
was just running too much power do we
know like what kind of wattage above
1800 okay so above 1800 watts there's
the result of that so just too much
power obviously you don't need to worry
about this at home for stock use but I
I'm positive you have this under liquid
nitrogen right just liquid nitrogen and
there's the dee-lighted cpu so you can
see the the die and you've probably seen
this before at this point but one thing
we were asking about is we've discussed
in the past about how Intel these X 299
ex-59 CPUs went with a dual substrate
and I never quite understood why and my
understanding is it's just so that the
primary substrate here with a die is
more easily accommodated to the square
ilm or the narrow ilm and so it's
actually just makes more modular so
Intel can more easily pull the the
important part which is the die and its
substrate off and put on two different
packages for use in server or enthusiast
desktop use case and stuff like that
so so that's a deal a 230 175 acts
with some scorch marks you won't see
many of those I think how you cookie
this this does not happen too frequently
right it's it's not too common so that's
not too common you give scorch marks but
this is pretty cool as well so this is a
custom Allen soup pot that was made for
the X 599 overclocking and if you don't
know when Intel did their 5 gigahertz
demo on stage at Computex they were
using the gigabyte board so we did our
review with the ACS board ace using
gigabyte are the only two motherboards
4x $5.99 right now and like I said we
have some some more information on the
gigabyte board that will come out
shortly on the channel because we just
got to see the mass production model
that were close to it anyway
so gigabyte was the one that was used
for overclocking and I think also was
the only board that was able to do 5
gigahertz at the time basis wasn't ready
yet so this is the Alan teapot that if
you wanted to do Alan - hi cookie made
to fit on the mounting 4x $5.99 because
as you've probably seen on our review
$5.99 is a slightly different socket
than normally it doesn't have the Iowa
the the loading mechanism so there's no
ilm on it
and that makes it difficult to get
mounting pressure and to adapt different
Allen to pots on the market to it you
have to make something custom so anyway
sort of similar to like the t-rex or
something like that and that it's a bit
smaller but it's very high density high
mass and then also over here is one of
the ek velocities we used an ek I think
it was the velocity I'm not sure but we
used an ek waterblock like this for our
children - 5 X overclocking and this
one's been used for overclocking
recently so I think the the relevant
information that I have over here this
board has a label on it 4.6 gigahertz
for 104 prime95 okay is that a VX not a
VX so four point six gigahertz was that
with this waterblock yes okay so four
point six G with this water block
for 595 non AVX 33 X for the mesh or
from Korb and then 40 200 megahertz 4266
for the frequency CL 18 on that and that
was doing 800 watts for that which is
pretty high but not quite as high as the
1800 watt burnout affairs another 31
study by max other you've written some
high cookies written some other
overclocks over here so 43 33 megahertz
for one of the higher memory overclocks
that was with a b c lk of 98.6 40 to 66
with VC LK of 11.6 and I think it's
difficult to get above on and to be CLK
yes so there is a screenshot that was
behind me over here we can show as well
was 4.4 for the memories 40 400
megahertz on that and I guess we'll just
show that off quickly too so if you look
here at DRAM frequency 2200 you're just
multiplying by by 2 there but so 44
hundred megahertz hex a channel and this
is the I guess the the screen shot of
high cookies highest memory overclocked
on this platform okay
it's the highest memory overclocked on
this platform and the overclocking is
also interesting to talk about so a lot
of you since we did the the stream with
jost upon z a lot of you asked if we
could do some kind of volunteer
overclocking with AMD I'm working with
Joe on doing more of that so stay tuned
for that but hi cookie of course working
at gigabyte has already done plenty of
overclocking with a and the eags that
make platforms for both Intel and AMD
products so a thread Ripper I think
under liquid nitrogen what was your
highest 5.4 that's what 32 core 2990 WX
and what kind of voltage for that
five 1.5 volts 5 point 4 gigahertz okay
over seventeen hundred watts okay yeah
yeah so using a course here at a X 1600
I pulling over 700 watts and I guess I
can note here too that we've done some
load testing on the coarser power
supplies in the past like I think the HX
850 and we took it up to like like 950
watts and it was fine
so no OCP so on the for AMD overclocking
with a 32 core or 2990 WX at a 5.4
gigahertz what what what was your
biggest challenge at that point was it
just thermal like did you have do you is
there a cold bug with AMD or no no cold
by okay so do you just run full pot okay
well the GPU is okay well who says place
by Y hmm hey Jim why okay okay so full
pot for it PCI Express gen1
by Juan is that just for stability yeah
okay hmm for Cinebench
what do you know what Cinebench score
you got
8,400 okay it's very high so for that am
the overclock x3 99 gaming seven for the
motherboard on that gigabyte motherboard
of course so I think that's probably
most of the cool stuff in the lab
there's all kinds of test equipment of
course I mean like for example just
random digital multimeters lying around
like this fluke 28 to our 28 III guess
but on top of your highly chiller and
then you have I think some other
equipment over here like is this some
tech just a digital a laser thermometer
so just laid a thermometer and lots of
cool equipment
there's insulation all over the place
there Allen two containers in the corner
there's a Dewar also over there so all
the equipment you need for liquid
nitrogen overclocking and then of course
doing some some research on water
cooling overclocking on chilled water
overclocking really interesting stuff as
a lab hi cookie is there anything that I
have overlooked here maybe you want to
see the this is
back to one hmm if it's right strong
people
yeah is it a shredder / or is it oh I
haven't I have not tried this one
actually it's very very good
hmm yeah like MD is dead the people we
just chill right yeah and they pop their
certificate to air-cooling
mmm so on the 28th course okay wrong air
cooling and the 24/7 stable we open up
at 4.2 okay and it's somewhat CPOE
to do a proper proper one mmm wait 4.1
4.2 is do we increase it just for there
that's pretty good prayer yeah yeah yeah
very cool yeah so is this on market yet
I think it's not good yeah okay so knock
to a air color and you can see the cold
latest sized appropriately for the 31
Saudi 5x and we've shown these these
free and these threader Percy peas in
the past as well and they work very well
actually the cold plate size matters a
lot so there's knock too as air cooler
you said 4.2 gigahertz on this do you
know what voltage 1.02 yeah pretty good
so knock to a 15 1500 RPM fan so that's
that's the I guess future products for
the 31 25 X so that's gigabyte OC lab
thank you for watching as always you can
subscribe for more and of course we
appreciate hi cookie and gigabyte for
allowing us to film this if you want to
see more of this content make sure you
check the channel cuz we'll be in Taiwan
and in China for the next two weeks so a
lots of faculty tours coming up thanks
for watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
