dotnet and today we're looking at
Nvidia's new gtx 950 video card with me
here I have the Asus Strix model of the
gtx 950 part of their Strix lineup and
this video card is brand new it launches
at an interesting price point of 160
dollars which i'll discuss why that's
interesting in a moment and in terms of
specs you're going to be pretty familiar
with most of it because it is the GM 206
GPU so that's got to GPU clusters 6
streaming multi processors 768 cuda
cores chips the base clock of 1024
megahertz has a boost of 11 88 megahertz
and it's got I feel look at my paper
here 48 TM use so much the same as the
other GM 206 products but the difference
here is that it's been toned down a
little bit for the gtx 950 video card so
this launch is a 2 gigabyte product on
128-bit memory interface so that does
sound small and it is to be fair but
it's not a linear comparison between
Maxwell and Kepler in terms of the
memory bandwidth because NVIDIA has done
a lot of optimizations on Maxwell and
this is something we've discussed in our
GTX 980 reviews and those optimizations
mean that the CUDA cores are about 40
percent more efficient than on Kepler
and this efficiency has gained through
optimizations like Delta color
compression which looks at the Delta of
colors between frames so temporally and
then it just determines the Delta value
to effectively print out for the new
color rather than the absolute value and
that's all discussed in great depth in
our GTX 980 reviews check that if you're
curious about what that all means but
same deal here with the GTX 950 so the
memory is a bit more efficient and the
CUDA core is a bit more efficient than
Kepler but that doesn't mean it
struggles a bit in non gaming tasks but
you're really not going to be using a
GTX 950 and production tasks anyway
the GTX 950 is priced at $160 MSRP but
scales all the way up to $180 from we're
told for the pre overclocked cards this
one I believe is priced at $170 for its
pre overclocked and it's Strix cooler
which is actually fairly quiet and
efficient it uses the same act
of idol cooling switch that we've seen
in previous tricks models so if it's not
under heavy load it'll just run idle and
use the passive cooling for dissipation
that would be the heatsink and the one
$60 price point puts the GTX 950 in a
weird place competitively it's basically
price against the r7 370 which is a few
bucks cheaper and the r7 370 is a video
card we do not have but we do have the
r9 270x and if you look at any
benchmarks out there they are
effectively identical in performance so
we will be using those two or the the
270x effectively as a stand-in obviously
there's some differences there but
that's the best we've got and the other
priced items nearby would be the gtx 960
at a pretty massive $40 jump at $200 for
two gigabytes or more for 4 gigabytes
the r9 380 which has replaced some of
AMD's r200 cards is priced at $200 so
again fairly big jump from a gtx 950
which makes it an awkward transition
into that next bracket and then below
the 950 is the gtx 750ti in the 130 to
140 dollar price point so really the the
main competition up at bat would be the
r7 370 the 270 X if you're replacing one
of those but otherwise you're looking at
something like a 750 Ti or equivalent or
gtx 960 r9 380 something like that
the main technological advancement that
Nvidia is marketing for the gtx 950 is
something that advances mobile gaming
they basically have said that look MOBAs
are a huge market right now which is
accurate and they've said that the
biggest item of concern to mobile gamers
that Nvidia polled was input latency and
that's something that we hear similarly
from csgo players Starcraft players rest
in peace and other games of that nature
so input latency is the delay view time
between the time you click the mouse or
hit the keyboard input and the time that
you see the impact in-game and normally
for a lot of us gamers it's so quick
that it's really almost unnoticeable for
hyper-competitive folks in the MOBA and
RTS fields and competitive FPS fields it
actually is a noticeable factor so
NVIDIA has cited its GTX 6
fifties performance metrics for input
latency as the item to compare the gtx
950 against and they've told us that the
650 had an input latency of about 80
milliseconds in dota 2 against the gtx
at 950 is 45 milliseconds so quite a
drop there almost half that's a 35
millisecond decline and this is not
something we can validate right now or
test on other devices it's something
that I'd love to do in the near future
and hope to do after pax
but it basically requires a middle
hardware solution so in our due√±o
computer or something like that sitting
in between your input device and your
game and that can measure the the
latency between delivery of the actual
input that is something we'll be working
on in the future but basically that's
the gist of what NVIDIA has set is
improved this time around and that is
something that will be pushed out
through GeForce experience in short
order so the way this works is pretty
interesting if you're into graphics and
pipelines and videos primary changes
have been to the graphics pipeline which
is what you're looking at here the
graphics pipeline is named appropriately
because without the previous items in
the pipe clearing production basically
is halted and the pipeline is limited by
the slowest phase which in this case is
generally the GPU render that's when the
longest pole is in the pipeline and if
you look at this closely you'll see the
game engine passes its frames to the API
which in this case is DirectX 11 or 12
and then DirectX has to continue
advancing the frame render from there so
once DirectX is done with the frame it
passes that frame to the GPU for a final
pass and render work which then sends
the frame to the screen you've probably
seen the word pre buffered frames before
in some games is something we've talked
about I think with maybe titanfall and
pre buffered frames is basically how
many frames the GPU sits in a buffer
before progressing in the pipeline it's
often - for a lot of games but you can
get away with just one pre buffered
frame in games like dota League of
Legends and heroes of the storm which
are the three games that NVIDIA has
advertised as having the reduced input
latency for the GTX 950 and removing the
second inflight frame the second pre
buffered frame from the pipeline is what
allows and
to decrease its input latency without
sacrificing gameplay or visuals some
games do actually need multiple pre
buffered frames far cry 4 is a good
example where it increases the
smoothness and performance of your
gaming experience so you really don't
want to sacrifice that second frame in
the buffer but for dota lowland heroes
of the storm it's not really necessary
doesn't detract from the experience in
fact it detracts negatively to have the
second pre buffer frame because you're
increasing the input latency this much
is fact and we are certain of so
removing the pre buffered frame from the
pipe is what gives the latency advantage
here but that's only in three games it's
only in the MOBAs you're not going to
see that anywhere else you're not gonna
see where it's detrimental so it's a
pretty limited and niche marketing
option here for the gtx 950 let's just
jump straight into the gaming benchmarks
here and see what this card's all about
csgo and dota 2 are both a non-issue for
high FPS high settings gaming with the
gtx 950 you can easily hit more than 100
FPS with settings tuning in both games
and it should be noted that both of
these games are playable on AP use and
on some iGPS
depending on your settings so being able
to play on a 950 isn't necessarily
profound but it is a more capable
solution than the IG PS and ap use
obviously moving on to other games with
grid Autosport the game is perfectly
playable at 1080p ultra with maxed out
lighting and ambient occlusion Landing
the GTX 950 at about 67 FPS on average
and the GTX 950 retains fluidity with
frame delivery and it's high 1% and 0.1%
low metrics so it's actually got pretty
high numbers for the 1% 0.1% frame times
with grid we see the GTX 950 falling
noticeably behind the GTX 960 with a 15
percent performance differential for the
40 or so dollar difference in price and
the r9 380 holds only a 4.3 percent
advantage over the GTX 950 the GTX 950
pulls ahead of the gtx 750ti by 25%
which is a pretty massive difference and
that's the difference between playing
60 FPS er over 60 fps so actually a
pretty big jump there if you can afford
the price difference but we'll talk
about whether that's worth it or not in
a moment looking at Far Cry 4 you really
need to dip to medium settings or
similar to play Far Cry 4 on the gtx 950
because at our normal 1080p ultra
configuration it just can't keep up with
other devices or with the game for that
matter and that's because it's sort of a
weird mid-range but sort of budget card
the gtx 950 struggles to play GTA 5 at
our very high and high test
configuration which basically sets the
game to its maximum settings - the
advanced graphics settings and the 950
pushed 47 FPS average against the 960 is
52 there are 9 285 55 and the r9 380 s
57 when switching to high settings which
is a drop in settings output we see the
gtx 950 pull into the range of 74 FPS
with again very high 1% and 0.1% frame
time metrics so that actually makes the
gtx at 950 faster than the r9 285 and
GTA 5 with high settings
despite a slowdown at very high the gtx
950 is 6.5 ish percent slower than the
GTX 960 in GTA 5 at high and 5.2 percent
slower than the r9 380 Metro is another
game where the gtx 950 struggles to keep
up at very high and high requiring a dip
closer to medium to keep up with the
game and the 950 runs 14% slower than
the gtx 960 20% slower than the r9 380
and r9 285 and runs faster than the r9
270x by 9% which if you remember the
270x is about equivalent to an r7 370
there's only a couple of frames increase
one or two at this range but that's
about it
Mordor shadow of Mordor is unplayable
that ultra but we see a climb to 65 FPS
at medium making the GTX 950 reasonable
if you're ok with dropping the settings
a little bit and note that the GTX 950
Albert
the 270x just about everywhere which is
where the r7 370 lands so that does make
it a competitive offering moving on to
thermals and wattage keep in mind that
thermals will vary depending upon the
manufacturers so we've got an asus strix
here the gtx 950 Strix sits at forty
three point nine three Celsius when
using automatic fan settings and that's
plenty cool it's a non-issue for gaming
and really anything in this range will
work well this is delta T over ambient
so you're getting closer to 60 Celsius
if you have a 74 degree fahrenheit house
and 60 Celsius really is very acceptable
for a gaming video card when under 100
percent load looking at the wattage we
see power draw peak system load sits at
199 watts and this is a measurement of
what the entire system draws when under
full load on the CPU and GPU so it's not
just the video card it's everything and
that means that you can get away with
about a three 100 350 watt power supply
depending on your CPU memory and drive
configuration if you're running
something a little bit lower end than
the 4790k a 350 watt power supply 300
watt power supply even would get by just
fine those are obviously a little little
hard to find most manufacturers don't
make them that small but you get the
idea this is just barely below the gtx
960 which has a higher 120 watt TDP and
60 watts below the competing r9 380
solution the gtx 950 is a good card but
it sits at an awkward price point at
$160 those with a more aggressive budget
would be better looking at the GTX so
does DTI or similar and those with a
larger budget would be better looking
into the GTX 960 the r9 380 or similar
options and the difference here between
the 950 and the 960 or the r9 380 is
actually pretty substantial in a lot of
games it is the difference between
lowering your settings and not doing
that so if you are one of those players
who does not like to sacrifice graphics
very much if at all then you really do
want to increase your budget by about
$40
maybe a little more than that and get
something higher-end if you care less
about going from ultra or very high down
to medium
and you just care about being able to
play your game affordably the GTX 950 is
not a bad solution in fact it's pretty
good it's only direct competition is the
r7 370 which is effectively identical to
the r9 270x in terms of performance
there's a slight gain but not much and
the gtx 950 does outperform that
solution and all the tests we ran and
it's a better performer thermally and in
terms of wattage depending on which
manufacturer you get for the thermals so
that does make the gtx 950 something we
choose over the r7 370 but again this is
an awkward price point so it's rare that
in the type of build I recommend I would
venture in this area to begin with
because I'm normally looking at a
budgeted 750ti or a higher-end r9 380
GTX 960 or equivalent for those who do
happen to fall into this price category
this is not a bad video card it is
something that we can confidently
recommend in terms of driver support and
function and games just keep in mind you
will have to sacrifice some of your
settings for the triple-a titles for
games like MOBAs for dota 2 league of
legends and heroes of the storm in
particular or future games like
overwatch you can actually expect very
good performance with this it will run
those just fine at max settings or near
max we're not hundred percent sure how
overwatch will be yet and then for the
MOBAs in the listing I just gave you
DotA Lowell and hots the latency
advantage here is actually supposed to
be somewhat significant depending on how
hyper competitive you are so if you're
very competitive gamer you will notice a
latency advantage with the newer Maxwell
cards this is something that my
understanding is we pushed throughout
the platform so it'll be distributed
through GeForce experience that means
that if you already own a higher-end
card it's not like you're gonna need to
downgrade to a GTX 950 to get that input
latency advantage so that is something
to keep in mind here it is being Co
marketed with the 950 but is not
necessarily mutually exclusive with it
if that makes sense so that is the GTX
at 950 that's all we have to say really
about the asus strix model of the car

and of course if you like our coverage
please look into our patreon page it's
linked in the post roll video
big thanks to the eight of you so far
who have supported us they're sort of
starting small but it is a big help to
get the patreon backers because it lets
us move away from traditional
advertising and hopefully diminish the
ads on the site as well so that's all
for now I will see you all next time
