glued it why man oh man this is super
messed though oh my god everyone today
we're taking apart the new Nvidia r-tx
2060 and this is the reference card
founders edition card as they call it
it's still a dual fan design but it's
been shrunk in a bit so it's it's a baby
version still a little tiny baby
RTX card the size difference is about 22
and I have 23 centimeters on the 2060
vs. almost 27 centimeters on the 28 ETI
but we need to see what's inside of it
it should be a bit interesting because
the PCB does not come all the way to the
end of the card and yet the power
connector is at the end of the card and
this is something we saw with the 1060
as well and it's something that on the
1060 required really interesting and
sort of annoying to work with cable
routing where they they run some cables
along the top of the shroud and then
solder them to the board so we're gonna
look at that and see how they routed the
cable
what kind of PCB and BRM it has all that
stuff today we'll have a separate video
for the review if you haven't already
seen that it'll be on the channel before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound
learn more at the link in the
description below specs and performance
will be in the review as always and
overall it's well it's the same cooler
so thermally you can check our review
for how it did but Nvidia actually gave
us to their credit a lot of lead time
this time with the r-tx 2060 which is
really appreciate there's a lot of video
card launches we typically have as
little as 1 to as much as maybe 6 days
to review the product having a couple of
weeks like 10 to 14 days is huge to
being able to produce better content and
that means that at the point of filming
this we actually I'm not even sure when
the embargo lists that's how far hot it
is so we'll leave the rest of the
discussion to the review but externally
it still has
the small screws that we typically find
on these and video reference boards and
on the backside of cooler it's got the
four largest screws that are probably
spring tension for the cooler
it's got still the same six screws for
the expansion PCIe slot and the new one
is on this side on the the power
connector side of the board it's got
three larger screws and then the base
plate and the cooler the heatsink do
look a bit different so let's take it
apart and see what it looks like
underneath get a good look at the PCB
NVRAM while we're at it just to
illustrate the size difference the text
barely even fits on the twenty sixty
whereas on the twenty eighty on the ti
you can see
something's gonna snap
man
there's a lot of glue well this as you
saw in the flashback was a huge pain to
remove and we're not gonna probably try
and remove that on the 2060 today but
we'll see we'll see how it goes so first
thing we recommend generally is taking
out the small screws and working around
to the larger ones these are typically a
I think it's Phillips 0 size so on the
original design there were 14 of these
small screws and we've taken off from a
apart at this point where it takes about
five minutes to take it apart if you're
really kind of trying to do it fast but
it is a slow process the first few times
this one has one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven of the small
screws they've gotten rid of three proud
of you on video got rid of three screws
on the original if you missed the
original coverage it is sort of
entertaining we did have a two-part
series taking apart the the shroud
assembly was actually pretty confusing
it was tricky the way they did it they
Nvidia so I mean it looks like you just
kind of take these four screws out but
as we showed in our piece what ends up
happening is you you take the heat sink
fan off with the shroud then you have
the PCB so if you want to do water
cooling mods that's pretty easy if you
want to take this apart like for service
maintenance replace a fan anything like
that it was a huge pain and the way to
do it was to take a heat gun blast it
out this front nameplate which has on
the 20 80s and 2017 glue underneath it
and then pop a screwdriver up in there
and pry it off which well I mean there's
a reason that it looks like that now
it's really not worth adding it back so
not sure I guess really the point is
Nvidia used an absurd amount of screws
at the point where it was just I mean it
was it was almost literally one screw
per r-tx op of which there were like 76
or something on the on that series card
so whether they do that again we'll see
it's sound like they had a ton of time
to change the designs it's not like they
particularly care what we think but
it did seem over-engineered and not
necessarily in a way that was beneficial
to anything okay so the plates pretty
much free we've got two panhead screws
here here's the back plate on Vail and
that's it there are two throttle pads
they look like Fuji poly pads we have
again the small I think these are four
millimeter screws but this time there
are fewer of them there are three fewer
just like there were three few of the
small ones small ones socket into these
we need to take those out there's our
four millimeter hex head and then okay
so those are not four do they change the
size or am i amis remembering is that
three point five Wow
that's messed up why did they do that
okay so well first of all let's look at
the back plates
28:27 t20 80 TI you've got the bit more
effort put into throwing pads on the
backside is it relevant well we'll see
in thermal and power testing which will
be more on the review not here but you
can't see the backside of capacitor bank
and dr. line right there MOSFETs are
gonna be opposite of these caps probably
the point is none of that is synced into
the back plate instead we have the
coating on it which is to prevent any
any direct shorts but anyway that might
not be too relevant what is just sort of
annoying though is that NVIDIA has
changed the size for whatever reason to
three point five millimeters I don't
like why would you do this I don't know
they're already they're already buying a
million of these screws you might as
well just keep using those so there's a
3.5 and these are four four it's not
really a big deal just sort of odd and
it's its own video it's it's a very
Nvidia thing to do how to change the
screw size on there already odd screw
selection but whatever we'll deal with
it back to this one there are I think I
said 11 of these they're pretty good fit
there I'll give them that and they use
the red loctite on them
damnit it's gonna keep happening these
are like really in there every time
that's why they changed it make it more
exact fit alright so a couple more of
these and while I've been working I've
been tracking the screws just on the the
mod mat so if you haven't already picked
one up you can buy one of these mod mat
build services I'm working on on store
doc gamers nexus net
it has a grid screw tracker for video
cards just like this one and then a
wiring diagram for PCIe pinouts over
here that we can use later when we're
checking the shunt resistor paths so
we'll be checking against twelve volt on
the shunt resistor legs to see which one
corresponds to which which had real a
next thing we're gonna do is there are
oh it's got DVI I haven't seen that in a
while on an Nvidia card so three of
those larger screws pH set zero that's
one Phillips one and then three Phillips
0 and then a 4 millimeter hex head it
looks like four think that is four this
time which is also why it's kind of
annoying that I really made that change
cuz it's gonna be separate sizes that
might be five that we'll see five
millimeter hex head begins to separate
for sure I'm thinking it's gonna be
stuck ya see the wire oh that's pretty
annoying actually
okay we're gonna be careful this one so
the shroud is gonna separate from the
cooler if I remove these two screws
which seems like it will make it easier
to remove the PCB without damaging
anything just because of the the way the
cables are soldered ends that PCIe
header
or into the board from the PCI you had
her yes that's nice that's easier than
previously I've got this cable that I'm
stuck to though it's gonna be on the
right side of the board so what's the
best way to get this out those wires
right there those fat ones are the ones
going to this PCIe header and then that
ribbon or not really ribbon cable with
that set of wires there that goes to the
RGB LEDs and the fan Oh theoretically
RGB LEDs that are deactivated anyway so
I can get that disconnected I've gotten
it out on that side but these are these
are more problematic so because what I
can see they appear to be soldered not
connected which leaves me questioning
how I'm gonna reconnect that fan later
other than a lot of patience I guess and
this is super messed up that's kind of
really fun to reconnect later what do I
do
Thank You Phi separate oh there we go
okay cool I took awhile to figure out
but it didn't really achieve a whole lot
for us unfortunately it's gonna say I
think if I separate the heatsink from
the base plate then this will be easier
and I don't know if that's accurate
but my plan at this point is to try and
get this cable at I have to transfer the
camera try and get this cable for the
fans out because if I can get that out
then I can get the rest of the board out
without damaging the power connectors
but it really did a good job of closing
this one up and making sure you can't
really hear okay so there's the fan
Kalon try and walk you through
everything fan cable there this does not
disconnect on the fan side it's all
soldered
so I've disconnected it from the PCB
which you can kind of see there that
that's the wiring right there that
connector is not in a socket right now I
took it apart so it's loose but the
biggest concern is I need to fish that
fan cable out somehow
now that the the base plate has been
separated from the card why man
all of this just to get a friggin cable
off to the side so that they like this
seems like a Jensen decision like they
didn't want the power header here
because it would be in the middle of the
card and would be ugly I guess and they
can't make the shroud shorter because
then both fans won't fit I think is my
understanding yes that is true both fans
wouldn't fit if they took this chunk off
so power leads are right there you can
you could solder something straight to
it but they often not - I think I think
if I get those screws out then I kind of
free that cable shoutout to the viewer
who sent us this hopefully get some
yesterday there's two or three of these
in there so there's a plate in there
it's not really super visible on camera
I don't know how to make it more visible
but it's over the over the fan cable so
I just took the screws out for that and
the goal is to route the cable through
you've got to be careful that PCB just
hair on that screwdriver nice well
there's a stupid plate okay now we can
get the cable free they glued it nvidia
did you not see the Walmart video
there's a blob of hot glue in there what
so not only is this cable obnoxiously
routed through here to a point where
like you can't even disconnect it
without taking literally everything
apart
it also has a plastic cover with no
meaningful labels on it plastic cover
that sits here to help with cable
management I guess and also make it
impossible to take apart so you have to
take this out which in my instance
because I don't want to like rip the
soldered end connectors out of the board
which you can now see clearly right
there I was using a right angle
ratcheting driver which couldn't ratchet
because there's not enough you know it's
not enough resistance on it so then
you're doing one turn that way and he
gripped ratchet and then in quarter turn
grip quarter turn so that takes forever
on three screws and there's a fourth
screw in there only one of them was
accessible externally and I'd like
without doing that process and then they
glued in half of the cable just this top
half actually is it all of it might be
all of it some of its kind of dried oh
my god and they glued it to this metal
right angled like plate in there see
that plate in there it's glued where the
green one is why well I NVIDIA why do
you hate specifically me that's what
this comes to hunter someone at Nvidia
is like Steve's gonna take this apart on
camera and I and I want to watch I want
to see if I can I can stop it before he
gets too far see if I can stop him from
revealing the dye okay so now what I
guess I separate mmm that does not
separate I just like a screw there to it
that was that - that must hold down this
thing so if I take that out maybe the
header comes free I bet that's what
happens next I think that's the next
home
that comes off and then this is now free
all right
okay so that was annoying
Fuji poly pads we have lots of these so
I can replace the torn ones one two
three four five six memory modules
Samsung memory on ours let's see there's
memory up this is memory kind of draw a
box around this there's your memory VRM
this is your V core v RM and one two
three four five six if we're counting
inductors are there any doublers and yes
nope no double e's following the rest of
the twenty series getting ready to
doublers GPU as tu 106 - 200 a - ka - a
1 so a 1 as always just a revision
number T 106 is the GPU - 200 a is the
sort of subclass of the GPU if there is
one there might be another T 106 - 300 a
for example a after the 200 is a
demarcation of a higher bin so it'll
overclock a bit higher it's a bit more
expensive as opposed to the partners who
have to buy the the a bin GPUs for more
money or they can buy the non a ones for
like the sort of on the the 20 70 that
would be your your cheapest model I said
what was at 500 bucks for the cheapest
model or something those are all not a
die size get a rough measurement so
external measurement twenty four point
four four wide 18.8 one tall I don't
know that there's really much else to
look at other than maybe the shunt
resistor assignment
it should just there's two of them so
there's one here and then there is one
shunt resistor there
and one of these will go to PCIe and one
will go to the PC a power cable so I'm
guessing this good probably goes there
that's continuous so if you look at the
multimeter you'll see 0.1 for the
resistance ohms and when it changes
that's just me slipping off of it so 0.1
that says that this backside shunt is
connected to the 12 volt PCIe cable and
if you wanted to do a shunt mod for some
reason on this card that would be where
you would do it think that covers it
think that back cards the PCB guess we
didn't really look at this yet because
it's all glued together let's let's try
and do that so well we can see the
bottom so what's happening here
you've got a big copper block here it's
bit thick that's not necessarily a good
thing but it's just for clearance
reasons it's so that they can get it
down low enough to hit the GPU but you
generally want to a you want more
surface area not more density so anyway
the copper cold plate their contacts and
then that is connected with two heat
pipes here so it is a heat pipe cooler
there's another heat pipe hidden in this
area here you can see the end of it
there so heat pipe there and that if we
actually look really closely and not
sure how well the camera will see this
but you can see where it's routed based
on just an impression on the bottom side
here so you can kind of see the outline
of the heat pipe underneath this plate
going like this into the cold plate and
actually I can if if I look kind of down
that slot I can see the copper turning
so yeah it goes like this and then some
foam for damping the blue thermal putty
that they've used previously is back
again and that is connecting the base
plate to the heatsink it's connecting it
to this the sort of rougher surface
which I don't know if that's an aluminum
or steel or what
I think that's a loom and I'm pretty
sure that's aluminum so baseplate
connects to what we think is probably an
aluminum base plate to the cooler and
then on the underside you have the
thermal pad some of which we'll be
replacing with new ones of the same
model I have all the all these same
exact models here so thermal pads
connect to the PCB goes through the base
plate base plate has kind of the EVGA
approach to EVGA zhan plate fin stacks
that they did with IC X and that's
present here as well so a bit of extra
surface area there it's over the memory
and over this is the bottom of the card
so this is kind of near the chart the
inductors and the bottom MOSFET that's
near the top of the inductor that's yeah
near the let's bit off to the side and
then included in power cable and I for
the fans so I think that covers I think
that's that's everything this is not a
vapor chamber so this is an aluminum fin
stack heatsink with heat pipes cold
plate and then air goes through it they
call it and that's your cooling solution
okay so I don't even know what I think
of the video cards performance as we
film this now it's in the review the all
the testing is done I haven't looked at
the data I haven't written the script at
this point today keep in mind we film
stuff in advance of embargo left so I
don't I can't tell you that the me in
this video can't tell you what I think
of the video card but the review that's
probably already up you can see what I
think of it as far as performance power
consumption cost all that stuff well
we'll talk about here is the only thing
I presently have thoughts on besides the
the fact that we have test data I
haven't really looked at yet the video
Curtis M Blee is completely insane I
don't know what like why NVIDIA insists
on doing this to themselves and everyone
else this is not this isn't cheap to do
this is an expensive way to tell the
video card there are pretty good coolers
on them
I get for video cards that the we know
the cost of and so the video card
partners the AV partners you know and
probably by their their cards they spend
area from twenty to fifty dollars on a
cooler fifty being like the really
expensive sort of high-end top-class
cards and twenty and we're talking
twenty eighty twenty eight see highs
here twenty dollars being like the
twenty seventy cheapest coolers and some
of the twenty seventy cheapest coolers
are perfectly fine and they would
certainly be perfectly fine for this but
I don't know what Nvidia's cost is to
build this thing but it is crazy what
they're doing because and that's the
glue residue right there from the cable
I guess like if you look at it so let's
do kind of benefit of the doubt Occam's
razor thin here not even that it's just
it it might I be in confidence or malice
I think it's just probably like they
thought this was the best way to do it
because Nvidia is not very experienced
with building the actual cooler and
anybody has been getting into this new
design with a dual fan dual axial design
so they're new to it they're doing a lot
of really weird things to try and like
secure the cable for example glue a
plastic plate and like six screws I
think one two three four five six seven
screws to hold down the the cable just
why I don't I don't quite get it the
card might be totally fine it might be
good value like I said check the other
video it's just it's it's really gonna
be difficult to maintain if you have to
take it apart and it is pretty common to
take a card apart to reapply thrown
paste after maybe say three years
because it starts hardening and you
replace it and you got pretty
significant performance gains thermal
performance thermal reduction by
replacing the paste every couple years
from the stock initial pace that cures
so that's a real thing people do and
they don't have to be like modding it or
anything crazy you just replace the
paste and it's not gonna be easy with
this card replacing the fans it won't be
easy with this card in no way is this
card an easily serviceable product and
that's something that we don't
like because generally speaking the
ability to service a product either as a
byproduct of the design because they the
manufacturer and fewer screws therefore
making it easier to take apart or
because the company is actually making
it an active effort making an active
effort to make it easier to serve as the
product ie Motorola with their new
phones those are that's that's something
we'd like to see because it's I mean if
if you're buying a new phone because you
can't replace the battery in it then
that's a bad reason to buy a new phone
if you're buying a new video card
because it's getting too hot because
it's been in your system for three years
and there's dust caked in the inside
that you can't see and you buy a new
card instead of replacing the pads in
the paste that's a bad reason to buy a
video card unfortunately with this card
it is a it's a bit of work it's not the
worst it's not the biggest deal in the
world to take it apart but there is
inherently a bit more risk taking it
apart these are pretty beefy soldered in
there
there are thick gauge cables but it's
still not that difficult to snap that
connection if you didn't take the the
care we did today it's also just a lot
of people aren't going to see this video
when they go through that process and so
they're gonna have to figure it out
themselves it's again not terribly
difficult just just why it's no reason
for it to be this hard so whatever I
don't know what Nvidia is doing this is
this design is completely crazy it was
just it was crazy with this card - I
thought but this is actually I don't
know if I want to say worse well it's
rough because with this one like to take
the entire cooler assembly apart since
it's the the vapor chambers soldered to
the rest of it it is a bit more
difficult to get the cooler apart but to
get to the PCB on this it's not that
hard it's 14 18 20 26 screws you can get
to the PCB and 26 screws on this without
any weirdness going on with this one
well we'll take a shot of the grid I
have here to show the amount of screws
that were involved it's not I don't know
it's it's more about like the difficulty
of just finding them and taking them out
without damaging the the fan connector
or the power connector so anyway that's
the 2060 reference teardown you go to

to buy a mod mat with a screw tracker
