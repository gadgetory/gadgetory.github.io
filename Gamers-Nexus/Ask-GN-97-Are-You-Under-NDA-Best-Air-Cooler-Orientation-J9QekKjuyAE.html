ask yen and actually one of the last
ones we'll be filming in this space
pretty sad actually mostly to me
probably but it is one of the last SAS
gens we'll be filming here we're moving
to the new office basically immediately
after this within 24 hours all this
stuff is going over there and by the
time the office shoots go up we'll have
already been in there for a while
so at some point senior AMD analyst
snowflake may be joining me for this
episode she is in here hanging around
but we have a lot of good questions for
this week we're shooting three she is
right on cue shooting three of them and
one will be for patreon backers on
patreon.com sorry for the microbe there
patreon.com slash cameras Nexus for that
you can stay here on the channel or
subscribe to catch the second episode if
this one doesn't go up first and just to
answer the immediate question
snowflakes still going to be in videos
we have set last time but just do it
again
she'll be in b-roll shots even when
we're in the new office so don't worry
about that before that this video is
brought to you by the corsair strafe RGB
mark to mechanical gaming keyboard the
strafe mark 2 uses Cherry MX which is
available in MX red and MX Island and
uses the elevated key cap design that
has become part of course there's
keyboard identity elevated key caps make
the keyboard much easier to clean with a
blast of compressed air and limit dirt
build up the keyboard use a metal body
design of hat received praise from us in
the past in old reviews for high build
quality learn more about the Corsair
strafe mark 2 at the link in the
description below alright so for this
week I I need I need this can I can I
please have this thank you so we have a
couple good ones
first of all GM store has been fully
restocked so we have the mod Madison
stock for now we have the chalkboard
shirt The Blueprint shirt graph shirt
everything's been restocked so check out
store I don't we took off a bunch of
stuff from that shelf so she can fit in
how just were like heroes next to
Steinmetz pick that stuff up if you're
interested in it first question is from
rive ok who says well GN test be quiet
dark rock pro 4 or other
coolers in the near future yes there are
a lot of questions about this so some of
you may remember I wanted to do an air
cooler roundup last year but I'm not
doing it because it would have required
turned down a few benches that I needed
and we're gonna have the space now so
actually I just got done arranging and
organizing an inventory and with the
rest of the team all the coolers that
includes the air coolers and those will
be soon featured in a massive air cooler
roundup at some point we might do
individual tests up until then though so
yeah we have a lot of testing that I've
wanted to get to for a long time that we
can finally get to because I'll have
more space to actually work with that's
not just filled with stuff next question
is from Yousef Manzi Yousef who said or
I guess I copy/paste your name twice re
Yousef Manzi said if you do not have
built-in vcore Reid points on your
motherboard what is the best way to go
about measuring it with a standard
multimeter also kind of secondarily why
is the software temperature values more
trusted or accurate in comparison to
these software v core values different
things so to answer your immediate
question if you don't have built-in Pro
points you can find other ones does I
mean they still exist it's just they're
not designated as Pro points so an
example would be I don't have any
motherboards left here really except
stuff that's in use so I have a dead one
hang on
so a great example just this board is
dead it's not because I pasted the
socket it was already dead it's kind of
riskier but you can take a of course
comes over with an AMD motherboard q you
can take a motherboard and locate the
vcore capacitors that correspond to the
vcore VRM on the back of the socket like
I said it's a bit riskier because if you
don't have steady hands and you bridge
the components then you can create a big
arc but and that's not good
typically so we've done this in the past
but what you would do is you get the
motherboard off you take all the vrm
heat sinks off of it and you can just
start probing the vcore BRM for
resistance and find where
the different capacitors are going on
the other side so you can figure out if
you know which part of the vrm here is
4v core as opposed to like SOC or IO or
si or whatever you may be working with
find which part is V core probe one of
the like the legs for a choke or
something or masa whatever and then
probe a bunch of capacitors on the
backside until you find something that
is connected you just do a resistance
check so that'll tell you which ones are
connected do that while it's off and
once you know which ones are connected
you can turn on and probe the same
capacitor versus front and back side of
it so there's two ways you can do this
the riskier way is and the more accurate
way technically is to probe the
capacitors grap gonna push the mug off
the table throw in a bit of attach from
there ah you probe the ground versus the
other side it's a bit riskier you're
shoving two probes into a socket with a
bunch of tiny components and probing two
sides of something where there's there's
a risk of jumping things are keen things
alternatively you can do what we did
previously and you probe one side of the
capacitor that you know goes to V core
VRM and then you stick the ground into
like a molex round pin and I'm molex
cables in front of me here but their
standard pin out we actually we have
more lifes wiring diagrams on our mod
mat on tutorial at Cameron's excess than
that if you ever need one readily
accessible it's on the Ahmad mat so
looking at my own mod mat here the
ground pins are the middle two on molex
connectors stick the ground in one of
those take the red and probe the correct
capacitor you'll have a bit of an
accuracy so this depends on the length
of the cable depends on a couple of
other things but for a standard link
cable typically snowflake
she just knocked the cryo not off the
table - it's really throwing a fit today
all right let me backtrack that a bit I
got distracted by the snowflake dealings
so typically the inaccuracy just to make
sure I got it correct here it's it's not
a ton it's like 20 to 50 millivolts
something like that on average so yes it
will be an accurate but it's close
enough that you can pretty much get it
if you don't have read points and if you
don't want to risk the more accurate
method of probing the socket with both
probes so that would be the way to do it
and that's that's if you don't have
built and read points next thing I don't
know if there might be like debug tools
you could buy tool - I'm not sure I know
I may just go back to the socket but oh
yeah your question about why is softer
CPU core package temperature values more
trusted or accurate in comparison to the
V core values they're different things
so it depends on what you're reading but
with like hardware info 64 you're going
to have multiple read points for V core
so you'll have read point at the
motherboard you'll report it at the CPU
and those are gonna be different values
so make sure you get the right one for
what you're looking at because if you
get get like the V core CPU value versus
V core motherboard value there's
disparity there if you're looking at the
wrong one it might look too high or too
low versus reality and then software is
just generally a little inaccurate with
that kind of stuff anyway I had another
interruptions you had to leave the room
it's go probably do some real work next
one Alex Trotta asked you in our
reviewers allowed to say they are under
NDA now almost universally any NDA the
whole point of the NDA is that it's also
under NDA and like some people think
that's funny or stupid but it's really
not because I mean if you if you get an
NDA not many companies by the way do
signed NDA's it's pretty rare but if you
get one or if you get just a verbal
agreement of an embargo and then the
next thing you do is you go say hey guys
I'm under embargo with Intel with
gigabyte with in video with
kindness spoils it doesn't it cuz
there's a good chance you can figure out
what's happening even if you don't know
the specifics you still know that oh
okay I know CP is coming over new GPU is
coming so yeah it makes perfect sense
that that would also be covered now the
lines have been blurred here a lot with
the rise of influencers and the rise of
YouTube and stuff like that so
traditionally in ages past and we were
once almost entirely article driven I'll
remind you on gamers Nexus net
traditionally what happens is get
information you get an embargo date and
there is zero discussion of that
information until the embargo date
there's no unboxing there's no tweeting
photos of the product if you have it
there's no social media anything there's
no like basically free marketing and
advertising so it was you got the
information you shut your mouth and you
worked on it and then when embargo lifts
came you published it but now because
these companies have realized the power
of influencers and the power of just
YouTube in general even for those of us
who don't consider ourselves you
influencers now the companies have
realized that power in terms of sales
volume they try to leverage it and so
they do that by having unboxing
embargoes and by having an unboxing the
news embargo a review embargo all like a
week apart each with pre-orders up
before reviews are up and stuff like
that
so like I said the lines have blurred
where the meaning of an embargo or an
NDA when at once meant all this
informations shut up don't talk about it
so tell your all you and all your peers
can talk about it which also by the way
generally is a good thing because it
means we can spend more time on
something rather than rush to all try
and kill each other to be first
and whoever supplies least information
so it's a good thing to have those those
embargo restrictions in most cases for
complex products but sidebar there so
besides that point the the idea of an
embargo or an NDA now includes things
like having nonverbal Understanding
between parties that if you share so
Media photos of the thing they're
probably not gonna reprimand you they
might look the other way you probably
shouldn't do it but chances of getting
in real trouble are pretty low because
it's it's not going to do anything
except for move product and and then
there's other things like unboxing
embargoes which are separate from
information embargo and stuff like that
so it's answer your question typically
no but with the way social media is now
on how it's erupted
even though typically no you can't talk
about if you're under MDA or embargo
you'll kind of get the hints from a lot
of people just because the companies
look the other way if it's just a tweet
with a photo or something some
advertising whatever another thin on
this is there are there are times when
we might say if we're under NDA or
embargo or not it really just depends on
what what's going on what the product is
it's stuff like that also keep in mind
that being under embargo NDA or aware of
a launch doesn't mean that people in
media actually have information on the
product because there's a bit of lead
time there normally where everyone's
kind of getting caught up and there are
different regions so different regions
of media have to get on the same embargo
at different times based on their
regional managers things like that I
don't know if I have anything else to
add there I think that more or less
covers it but the answer is no you
shouldn't but sometimes you can just
generally speaking it's agreed that you
don't share the NDA and the really
interesting irony with that Nvidia NDA
that we we did the video talking to a
lawyer about it and several other people
talked about that NDA a while ago the
interesting irony with that one is that
the document itself was leaked and the
document permits discussion of what was
confidential information under the
guideline that it has been posted
publicly by someone so the document was
posted and therefore the document
allowed the discussion of the document
that the NDA because it was posted
publicly so it's kind of just a fun
irony there next one
as on Cherise says when NVIDIA runs out
of scientists to name their GPU
architectures after would you like to
what would you like to see them start
using islands like AMD did parks or cats
like Apple did for OSX I think I I think
AMD or Nvidia when they run out of names
for their architectures they should
start naming their products after Nordic
death metal bands along with using the
fonts for those bands so that nobody can
read them that's that's that's what I
would do I'm sure it'd be very
marketable next one is savage savage
says ever have anything any component
damaged by a pet also any stories about
breaking expensive tech or any times he
came close I have I have discussed this
once in the past but I'll bring it up
again same story probably probably for
some of you but it's been a while there
was a time when actually with one of
these socket motherboards in am3+ board
I think some of you may be familiar that
PGA boards like this the AMD boards
especially with FX when you remove the
cooler a lot of the time it'll rip the
CPU out of the socket with it if the
thermal paste is kind of acting a bit
like a glue there's some surface tension
there is some suction when you remove
the cooler because of the way the the
socket is not quite as secure as a full
retention socket like LGA which and he
also uses these days so if you're
familiar with that yes you can like
wiggle it back and forth and it'll
eventually break the seal and you can
pull it off generally fine not always
the case that depending on what their
own tastes are using so there was a time
when I had like a 93 I don't remember
that with CPU names to be honest with
you I want to say there were 93 seventy
and ninety five ninety or something like
that the the high like the highest-end
a.m. the FX cpu they still the box over
there and those those were socketed and
a board one of them and I removed the
cooler it ripped the CPU out of the
socket which is always something you you
really don't want to deal with or see
but when I
closer I saw that one of the pins had
been ripped out of the CPU and stayed in
the socket and so fortunately I was able
to restock it the CPU left the pin in
there every socket it turn it on and it
also worked now we never tested with
that platform so I I mean which is a
good thing because I don't know if
anything would have been influenced by
that but it worked fine and I didn't
lose any memory channels I didn't lose
any performance so that was a close call
I mean it did break the processor yes a
few things not every pin is used but
also because I left it in the socket and
just remounted it was still making
contact to the pad so that was a fun one
pets no not really I mean snowflake
nearly shattered this glass if that or
this mug camera zexis mug nearly nearly
shattered that a minute ago she pushed
this thing off the table a few minutes
ago but no no no actual damage I've
killed a lot of stuff though just with
like latent ESD and stuff like that next
one is from Stefan Spence in a couple of
questions in a series hope it's ok will
your new studio allow you to do test you
know custom loop hardware if so what
kind of tests if not why not the answer
is in order yes it will allow us to do
custom loop hardware same problem we
don't have the space here to do it
because especially custom loop it takes
so much space just to have like a drain
area and what kind of tests I'm Marcus I
mean I'll show you some of them so I
want to do just like basic stuff so GPU
GP block testing multiple blocks on the
same card really controlled you know put
like flow meters in there thermocouples
in there all that stuff we'll do some at
some more advanced stuff it's just don't
have any space right now time is a
problem too and moving to the new studio
isn't going to solve that like I might
get a couple extra hours per week
because the time reduction in
requirements to do other things like
teardown benches but that's still going
to be a problem so it's not going to be
an immediate test mr. Nick in reference
to limiting factor on CPU
air coolers I have a question regarding
the heat pipes since most cases mount
the motherboard vertically and the
cooler is mounted vertically how exactly
do the heat pipes work it would seem
that they would need to be up or down
for the fluid inside to boil travel
length of the pipe condense and then
return for them to be truly efficient
does that mean if you keep your case on
the side so that the heat pipes go up
and down they would be more efficient so
this is in reference to I mentioned our
old video TL DR how CPU coolers work
it's great video it's one of the ones
that I really like to making because we
have some 3d animations in it that
really help visualize a point search the
channel for TL DR CPU coolers or
something so yeah heat pipes quick
refresh reheat pipes have a liquid in
them and the liquid boils when it's over
the cold plate and then it goes up the
heat pipe it condenses at the top
because that's the coldest spot comes
back down the heat pipe through a
wicking a sintered mesh or weave
material or a composite material which
is normally like just mixes of coppers
in there so that the water trickles
through copper sintered material or
weaves or whatever on the way down and
further improves the thermal
conductivity and cooling capabilities of
the heat pipe so that's the process the
way it works in reference to your
question so heat pipes it's not like
liquid in this thing it's it's not the
same where I can move this and the
liquid is is moving around physically I
mean I guess you could but with a
mounted cooler just something that's on
the heat pipes they're effectively
vacuum sealed so that's pretty important
the the liquid has a low boiling point
it's not like water where it needs to be
100 degrees Celsius or something like
that so low boiling point basically
vacuum-sealed between these two things
as it boils it the the gas that is a
product of the boiling will move
wherever it can and it's not going to be
where there's liquid so it ends up
getting pushed the end of the pipe where
it can condense and drip back down or
get be carried down I shouldn't say drip
I think drip is what causes this
question because if you say drip you
think well how can how can liquid drip
that way like how does that make sense
where
damnit that makes that's right
like we can drip like that so I
shouldn't be using the word drip I
apologize that's confusing the word I
should be using is capillary action
that's what's going on so they're like I
said there's a center to composite a
MASH or weave or other type of copper
material inside of these heat pipes and
through capillary action you are getting
the the movement the translation from
one end to the other so it's that simple
it's I mean it's if you take a paper
towel and you dip just the end of it in
a cup of water right you pull it out you
can watch the water crawl up
it's a capillary action stuff we learn
about in an elementary school hopefully
so that's the basics of of answering
your question is there anything else I
need to say it's it's a pretty natural
process capillary pressure is involved
for the transportation of the fluid so
that there were several questions about
that and they're very good and I hope
that answers it for you next one is from
Mustafa Ahmed who says just wanted to
know why doesn't Intel include the IGP
you with HED TCP is very simple answer
here you have a limited amount of die
space silicon space under the IHS the
die is much smaller than the heat
spreader itself and then the CPU package
itself and part of that die is a portion
to whatever cores to cache and to the
GPU if it has one i GPUs now are
starting to take significant i spaced
upwards and i am these stuff AP use the
ones that are like good upwards of 50
plus % so you imagine taking that amount
of die space even let's say 30% of a die
all of that area could potentially be
cores to be cache anything else inside
of the registers whatever so you're
you're taking that area and allocating
it to a GPU which I think in Intel and
AMD s vision if you look at thread
Ripper both of them seem to think that
for a workstation part that's supposed
to be focused on B and a CPU and nothing
else it doesn't make sense to suck up
some of that die space and use it
presumably that will likely not really
be used
other than for troubleshooting or out of
I mean just out of compactness because
you wouldn't have to use a slot for a
GPU for for video out if he didn't need
one so I think generally speaking they
and I would agree with with the
companies on this they see that the H
EDG CPUs are meant to be pure CPUs that
do CPU things and that's it and then if
you want a video out you can buy video
out or a GPU to do those things so it's
it's conservation of a very limited
amount of dye space to increase the
amount of cores basically you know think
of a think of if you had an HDD like
threader per thing imagine dedicating
50% of that dot of those dyes because
they're multiple to a GPU now you might
have something like 16 cores instead of
32 or whatever for threader for two so
that's the idea
next on Mork calling Orson says hey
Steve an airburst liquid question but
with a twist my understanding is that
air dissipates heat quicker shaving off
the bigger temperature spikes and liquid
maintains a more constant temperature
meaning less dramatic spikes in
temperature of the whole system but
possibly a gradual buildup of heat if
running at full load for an extended
period our own cat renders meaning long
periods of full load what is better a
more spiky at rapidly cooling CPU using
air or a gradual build-up to a
temperature that may result in a higher
sustained temperature over a longer
period the bigger thing here is you're
going to be looking at stuff like noise
considerations reliability redundancies
how important is it that your system
never has a failure and if it does do
you have redundancies and a lot of
people don't like closed-loop liquid
coolers for that reason because there's
zero redundancy if the pump fails same
is kind of true for an air cooler with a
fan but you can have multiple fans and I
think typically people are more likely
to notice of a fan failed and also they
last for like 17 years if you get a good
one so pretty unlikely anyway not that
pump failures are all that common but
they do happen and certainly when you
start doing things like having mixing a
pump with fans then you have multiple
points of failure Plus fluid you have to
worry about things
like like permeation that's the what I'm
looking for a permeation of the tubes so
ignoring all that stuff and just
directly to your question you are
correct in that yes liquid will soak
temperature better if you have big
spikes so you're dealing with a large
mass of liquid if you have something
like a 280 millimeter cooler or
something like that that's a lot of
liquid so we have a sudden spike to 250
watts and then it drops down the actual
increase in temperature is going to be
pretty small and the liquid will soak it
and and that is one of the advantages
now whether or not that comes into play
for you I think that's relatively
uncommon I I think the bigger concern
again it's gonna be things like noise
and redundancy so if you really want a
noise focus I'm liquid cooling is pretty
unbeatable but if you don't care about
that because it's tucked away you can't
hear it then redundancy reliability
might be more important but you want yes
you're correct liquid will soak better
technically speaking the air coolers
might be able to dissipate heat quicker
but the rest of it I would really make
your decision based on other factors
than those I guess is what I'm saying
and as for what's best I'll give you a
couple options here and then hopefully
just pick for yourself but if you are
focused on noise reduction a liquid
cooler is a great choice because you can
run the fans slower and they'll be
quieter and the liquid does most work
for you if you are focused on
reliability and redundancy and uptime
and you can never have downtime because
it makes you money that system and it's
going down cost you money then maybe air
might be a good consideration liquids
very reliable these days I don't want to
give anyone the wrong impression but in
extremely critical systems air cooling
is going to have fewer points of failure
but if you set up your alarms right and
your bio shutdowns right and stuff like
that you're gonna have any component
damage if you hit t.j.maxx it'll shut
down or throttle it's just you might
have downtime on the system but again
not super common the replacement rate of
liquid coolers is going to match or or
extend past
usable life of your system so most
likely really place and I liquid cooler
and something like five years you don't
keep your systems that long that's kind
of an irrelevant consideration the the
lifetime of the cooler but it is a
consideration nonetheless and not all of
them last that long
wholly it gives you some ideas next one
I think that's the last one for this
episode corrupt says mod Matt is
fantastic just bought to the real
question is can it play crisis first of
all thank you very much for buying to
you that's awesome there are not many
people who have bought multiple and we
sincerely appreciate everyone who does
we've got a decent amount warrants I
thought well they're gonna be out of
stock pretty soon again I'm trying to
keep them in stock it's just it's
difficult we're getting out of
production run going last week but it'll
be like another month you for those
random will allow you to backorder them
but if you order soon you'll actually
get it shipped like immediately
the real question though can it play
crisis actually as we noted previously
we especially bend our mod mats so only
the select reviewers that we liked the
most got a mod mat that was
overclockable enough to play crysis a
game from 2008 or something like that
alright so that's it for this one

unless I do some here just for nostalgia
sake or something and one more question
