awaited cases this year first shown at
CES in January the O 11 air is
advertised as an airflow focus case the
counterpart to the O 11 dynamic this is
done by removing the tempered glass on
the O 11 dynamic and instead of opting
for two intake fans in the front and a
grill our performance test results for
the o 11 air might surprise you though
as you'll see in today's review before
that this video is brought to you by the
EVGA CLC 280 liquid cooler people ask me
how I keep cool during the summer with
all this hair well I've tried a lot of
different products and if you do exactly
what I need
many of them cause tangles or worse EVGA
CLC 280 helps keep my core temperatures
low they're in hot benchmarking sessions
the CLC 280 is price competitive and
focuses on performance for value
offering a 280 liquid cooler at an
affordable price get yours at the link
in the description below hair mounting
kit sold separately so we'll have an air
next to me is the same internal tooling
as the oil evan dynamic we like the O 11
dynamic pretty good amount you can find
our review on that one for the full
details on the internal layout the build
quality and all that stuff it's more or
less the same here except for
differences in the stock fan
configuration and clearly differences in
the ventilation setup so the front panel
has changed the top panel has changed
and they're going for more airflow
focused push the O 11 dynamic I also
shipped at a price of about a hundred
bucks on pre-order I think it's like 130
these days
whereas this case ships at 120 to 130
give or take with two fans included and
then there's also a model that's an
extra thirty or so dollars that comes
with three additional fans there should
be five total as we understand it but to
check the spec pages when it all goes
live because that's been kind of in flux
since we first saw the cases so that's
the setup I think the more expensive one
is called the Leon leo 11 air RGB and
this one's just 11 air so for the set up
stock it comes with two fans in the
front they're 120 s and for the most
part this should be a pretty decent
performer but as you'll see later on
there's some interesting play going on
with the dust filter on the case
something we've seen in the past other
chord changes
include the front end now can support
three 120s or two 140s the nature of
getting rid of the glass you can put two
eighty millimeters or 192 millimeter in
the back over here because Leeanne Lee
added in new threaded holes for just
holes to drive a screw through that were
not there before there are two included
120 s at 1500 max rpm for the base
version and the RGB version comes with
these three Bora light fans which also
max out at around 1500 rpm give or take
10% that's for build quality overall and
build features the vertical GPU amount
has been more or less gotten rid of I
mean it makes sense with an air-cooled
version of the case it doesn't make a
whole lot of sense to put an air-cooled
dual axial card up against the glass the
11 dynamic as we showed you is capable
of actually doing pretty decent GPU
temperatures even one vertical because
it seats it back so far but for this
case we just tested it in the standard
horizontal configuration and then the
top of the case one of the things we
liked about this setup was how easy the
panels are to remove that's all the same
as the dynamic it's two thumb screws in
the back the top slides off the rail and
then there are there's exposure to the
side panels which we've removed here but
for the side panels you just push it up
like this one no screws or anything and
it just pops up so that was something we
actually really liked with the dynamic
and we still like it with the air if you
missed the original review comes with a
dust filter in the top no fans on the
top stock and the dust filters something
we'll talk about a whole lot and a
little bit the front panel has two
screws in it we've pre removed them and
then I just socked the top as well the
front panel problem I've had with this
is it is a little bit annoying to put it
back on so it's difficult to line it up
because there are two notches down here
you line it up with the front and sort
of just socket it into place not the
biggest deal in the world but it does
take a few tries to really get it right
and make sure it's flush on all sides
can definitely be improved but doesn't
necessarily need to be improved if you
follow there the front panel there's
your dust filter there that causes
issues we'll be talking about and then
also the front panel actual plastic
panel has a large amount of plastic in
it
I mean it's it's probably 50% plastic
and 50% of holes so not a ton of
ventilation through the panel despite
being called air however we tested it
without the panel and the thermal
difference is insignificant that's
because of the dust filter and again
give me a moment to get to that couple
quick notes on building and kala
management things like that for taller
graphics cards like this one for the
extra height cards FTW 3d gaming acts
some of the ACE use cards like the Strix
ROG cards those taller cards are just
tall enough that with cables plugging
into the top of the card rather than the
side it does actually bump up against
the glass this is a weird instance where
the EVGA power link might actually be
useful we typically don't really find a
whole lot of use for it but you could
use it in this one so that pushes
against the glass not a deal breaker
because you can still close it but very
close to being a deal breaker there are
a couple maybe like an extra millimeter
it would have been nice just for that
security on the upside tail management
is really easy in the back the case so
this is something we talked about with
dynamic but as a refresher because it is
sort of double wide in the back it has
to accommodate the power supply in the
left chamber so because it has to
accommodate a full PSU width that gives
you that same amount of width for
managing cables there are plenty of
cable tie points there is a kill
management bar back there which also
supports drives and that means it's very
easy to do it clean build if you want it
to be neurotic about your cabling you
can do it with this case and be pretty
happy with how it looks and how it's all
managed you can also very uniquely
remove the drive cage on the back and
instead do dual power splice probably
not something you're going to use it's a
single system case but for someone who
did want to use it like maybe their
Bauer who helped design the case because
he does high-end overclocking for
someone like him
it does actually provide a useful
feature that you can't really get many
other places so that's kind of
interesting other than that all the
other stuff it's the same as the 11
dynamic check that review for more
information on those there's great
attention to detail overall it just
comes down to how well does this thing
cool because we still like the build
quality a lot we still like the layout
and the size the form factor this thing
is like really not that much different
from the 280 accents high switch is a
micro ATX case and this is ATX it's not
that different from the H 200 in size so
if you're buying on the larger ITX cases
we really think you should consider the
Oh 11 series because it's not that
different in size and it's way better
overall in build quality but let's let's
get through the thermals here so as
always thermals and noise test and you
can find the test methodology in the
description below and our test bench is
in that article as well
we'll start with torture testing we have
a whole lot of extra tests for this one
with the filters removed panels removed
and things like that started with just
the Lian the 11 air torture testing
places CPU performance at an overall
unimpressive 50 degrees Celsius over
ambient as you'll see in our comparative
chart in a moment there's nothing
particularly special about this result
it's okay but not great for a case
marketed at air flow removing the
plastic front panel didn't change a
whole lot despite being so heavily
filled with plastic it dropped us from
50 degrees to 49 degrees within
reasonable margin of error we next
remove the magnetic dust filter running
with no filter and no front panel this
is where we saw a big change the new
result plotted 40 1.5 degrees Celsius
over ambient a steep 9 degree reduction
from the stock test we've seen this
before in other cases like the thermal
take G 21 where the dust filter is
responsible for significant airflow
restrictions we had two final tests here
one with a single exhaust fan added one
of the bore light fans which dropped us
to forty seven point seven degrees over
ambient not really impressive again the
last test was with three fans added one
top exhaust one side intake and three
front intake in this setup CPU
performance didn't improve in any
measurable way so we'll have to look at
GPU performance for a comparison
comparatively for CPU thermals CPU
performance is impressive when the
filter is removed but only then removing
the huge impedance of the filter brings
us to 41 point five degrees Celsius over
ambient which is superior even to the
long-standing leader that is the
silverstone raven our v02 unfortunately
because this performance isn't achieved
with stock setting
we can't give the Oh 11 ere our best of
bench award Silverstone retains that the
leading performance is derived from
close proximity between the CPU fan and
the intake fan good exhaust avenues
overall and good intake positioning
performance is exceptionally competitive
and impressive once the filter is
removed it's good enough that the 11 air
does become the best performer on our
bench which is a high bar to clear with
the filter installed the O 11 air falls
250 degrees over ambient between the
half X and 570 X at 1550 rpm the O 11
dynamic with three side intake fans also
performs about equally to this degree
GPU tortured temperatures for only the
11 series are now on the screen the O 11
dynamic with 3 side intake fans and a
vertical GPU positioned far back
performed the best a phenomenon that we
explained in our 11 dynamic review this
result is within a margin of error of
the O 11 dynamic with three side intake
fans in a horizontal mount the 11 air
the new one performs equivalently
without any front filter as it does when
keeping the filter and installing extra
intake fans and an exhaust fan the stock
11 air is again not impressive at 50 to
7 degrees over ambient but it does look
pretty good once you remove that filter
comparatively 4gb torture the O 11 air
lands toward the bottom of the GBO
torture performance tests when in stock
configuration the case is comparable to
the define are 6 and 805 infinity and
isn't all that far from the absolute
bottom it's getting embarrassed really
removing the filter changes everything
and propels the 11 air to the top 10
right behind the venerable rv0 - a good
place to be fortunately this is an easy
change for the end user to make all you
have to do is remove the panels and then
take the filter off moving on to the
other test will just be testing the
stock 11 air like we do for everything
else this means that the filter stays on
in firestrike testing a stand-in for
game benchmarks the o 11 air gets
embarrassed by the G 21 and dark base
pro 900 respectively a $60 case and a
silenced focused case if we look at the
11 dynamics performance at 53 degrees
it's clear that there's plenty of room
for the O 11 air it's a chart top but
that filter needs to be removed
as a small aside the 11 air does manage
to hold one of the better CB
temperatures in this test but that
hardly means much blender CPU testing
places the eleven air again toward the
bottom of the charge close to the G 21
and Silverstone's p.m. o - which is the
worst of the two primary cases on this
chart blender GPU rendering establishes
the 11 air just below the halfway point
right around where the H 500m mesh npm
of a to perform for noise testing first
note that the filter changes the fan
pitch to a higher whine than when the
filter is removed the DBA measurement is
the same at 48 point 3 DBA with fans at
max speed but the pitch worsens
despite being loud to keep in mind that
you can lower the fan rpm in position
this closer to 40 DBA which is our
acceptable target if lower in fan RPMs
reduce noise we'd strongly recommend
removing the dust filter to keep
competitive performance this noise
output is why the 11th error does so
well when unconstrained it's brute force
but it's still well designed to brute
force the case overall is still really
good value at the price and it's still
exceptional build quality
it's just that stock filter really
chokes the performance in ways that seem
almost impossible for a case that's
branded as an air case for airflow and
has grills and holes in it and all that
stop so what we'd recommend is if you do
get the case it's a fine case and if you
don't care too much about dust or you
can manage it through other means
just pull the panels off and then get
rid of this thing here because this is
ultimately what's causing all the
problems and the reason it is causing
those problems if you look at this
filter it's not particularly a fine mesh
and the problem with any dust filter
like this Silverstone is a good example
of a company that they make a lot of
weird stuff they make stuff that
probably very few people ever buy might
not be the best business decisions in
some cases but one thing they do really
well is invest in filters so what
Silverstone has showed us over the years
what they've really improved on and
focused on for like the last Computex
even is getting these metal sort of just
everything surrounding the hole
everything but the hole they've focus
I'm reducing the size of that metal so
there's less and less metal that means
there's less rigidity so it's not quite
as durable you could push a hole in it
much easier but there's way less
impedance there is a lot less material
blocking the flow through the filter in
this filter it's actually a pretty good
amount of obstructing material in the
filter itself so there's not as much
room for that air to go through it
requires higher static pressure and
overall it's a lot of impedance and
obstruction to air flow and it's all
just from this 10 degree reduction on
the CPU thermals by getting rid of this
thing it's a cat here near me so that's
really pretty impressive overall for
performance just by removing a filter
and it's the upside here is that this is
not a fundamental flaw it is not an
inherent flaw to the design of the case
so you can just remove the filter if
it's a concern of yours when that filter
is in there
performance is you might be
disillusioned by it would be the best
way to put it because it just it is not
super competitive for an airflow
targeted case removing it it does great
though and if you do want a filter there
are other filters again silverstone
makes some really good ones they make
120 millimeter size filters some of them
are most of them are magnetic you could
buy two of those if you're concerned
about dust and just slap them right over
those two fans and more air will get
through those then through this thing so
that's an option but overall just to be
clear here we still like the 11 dynamic
we like the 11 air as a case just in
terms of straight steel the metal the
chassis all that stuff it's well
designed it's just that one thing that's
a potential flaw and it happens to be
related to the core marketing strategy
of the case but you can really easily
fix it so not a deal breaker doesn't
nuke the quality of the case because it
doesn't require you to cut things apart
and do custom mods you just pull the
panel off and remove it if you care that
much so yeah that's that's our feelings
over all of it there's really no point
in getting the five fans in this thing
honestly for our test platform if your
build is gonna be similar to this you're
gonna have a tower cooler and a dual
axial cooler for your GPU
so pretty similar in that way then just
going with the original two fans
removing the filter that's all you need
to do don't bother getting the version
with more fans unless you really want
the RGB effect in the aluminum frame but
if you're doing it for airflow don't
bother
remove the filter you'll get basically
the same airflow performance as you
would with the filter and with five fans
and it'll be quieter than with five fans
too so overall there's plenty of room to
work with here as an end user just be
prepared to do that work not really a
deal-breaker either way price is still
good it is extremely competitive once
the filters removed to a point of being
the best even on our CPU torture chart
