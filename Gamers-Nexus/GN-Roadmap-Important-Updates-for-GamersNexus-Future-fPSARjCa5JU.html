roadmap update and what we're talking
about today is updates to our testing
methodology plus target launch dates for
those so we have some internal guidance
on when we're planning to use new
testing methods for CPUs for GPUs things
like that
we go in through some of that today
along with what those tests are and when
you can expect to see them also talking
about some updates to case test
methodology updates to live streams
overclocking streams special guests
quality checks for GN all kinds of stuff
so this is this is very much a GN fan
video if you like our content you'll
want to see this one to get an update on
what's coming up before that this video
is brought to you by be quiet and it's
straight power 11 series power supplies
the straight power 11 PSU is shipped
from 450 Watts up to a thousand watts
accommodating most of the gaming PC
build requirements you'd encounter and
focuses on delivering a higher quality
power supply that doesn't sacrifice on
efficiency or stability noise is also a
heavy point for the straight power 11
using a 135 millimeters silent wins
three fan that can spin as low as 200
rpm for quieter low load operation learn
more at the link in the description
below I'm gonna steal a line from Jay
here and say this is basically going to
be a talking head video so if you want
to have away and listened go for it so
growing a business is hard and GM's done
very well I've been running it since
roughly 2007-2008 I so I think
officially we started 2007 but didn't
really actually get doing stuff until
2008 website format entirely for a long
time didn't get serious in YouTube until
many years after that so as we have
grown we've obviously had to shift focus
constantly and this means that lose
we've lost track of a lot of timelines
on things we've wanted to deliver all
kinds of content and have fallen behind
on some of it in in exchange though
you've gotten a video every single day
for the most part we've missed a couple
every now and then but mostly video
every day we still publish articles so
we're obviously net positive here but I
would very much like to regain control
of our schedule and so for the past
couple of probably
past two months now I've had an internal
roadmap we haven't talked publicly about
it and we stuck to it pretty damn well
and before I woke I posted a public when
I wanted to make sure we had the ability
to stick to it
so I'm very confident in the dates we
have here today and just a couple of
examples of things that we had fallen
behind on that we've gotten back up to
speed with the r9 290x revisit that we
did I don't know maybe a month or two
ago now was something that I had
originally promised maybe like one to
two years before that and it just it
just disappeared just fell through we
had so many other things you have to
realize that like behind the camera
there's a shelf called things that need
to be reviewed and we have to add
another shelf and we're just it's
there's there's a lot of obligations so
anyway we eventually got back to the
290x
having the office has really enabled us
to start kind of steam rolling through
some of the content that we've wanted to
do for ages I'm still behind on a couple
of other deliverables that I promised
and some of them we finally have on the
roadmap so thank you for your patience
but let's go through a couple of these
things today I feel like going forward
my my hope is that now that we've kind
of gotten comfortable in the space we've
added to the team so Josh one of our
team members is relatively new maybe I
don't know six months now or something
like that and he's helped a ton with
video editing production so we're really
starting to to catch up here number one
thing that's important you're probably
going to see in the next couple of days
so CPU workstation bench overhaul we've
never really done workstation testing
we've done a couple of premiere tasks we
always do blender but we haven't
explored it too much and we're still not
going crazy with it but we have over the
past couple of months patrick has been
silently working on building an entirely
new test methodology test suite for us
for CPUs and I worked with him on this
but he's done all the implementation
work and we validated the numbers things
like that so it took us a few months to
kind of push through and figure out what
tests we want going forward what we're
getting rid of and I'm feeling pretty
good about it now so the workstation
bench over
morick station bench coming into
existence I should say is for CPUs only
part of our CP reviews and this is built
on top of a lot of requests from you all
so thank you for sending those in we do
listen sometimes it takes us six months
it might take us a year to add your
request and that's because the way we do
our content and this isn't the only way
you can do content of course there are
lots of channels to do it differently
but the way we do ours is we build a lot
of data we work off of kind of one
methodology for one type of testing for
a long time we trust that methodology
and we don't really get rid of it until
there's a substantial change maybe a
Windows Update for example has been a
common reason there's a there might be a
reason that we no longer trust the data
maybe we we started noticing like hey
this sip six great example we might
start noticing after the last update
this game performs 50 percent better
what the what happened and that actually
happened by the way we had to at one
point we did scraps of six and we had to
rerun everything and it sucked but and
actually to happen to get a few days a
couple weeks ago so anyway we stick with
them for a long time but that's why it
takes us so long to come up with a new
one and and we might take a while to add
your request but we've added several of
them so the workstation benchmarks we're
very excited about I've gone through all
the numbers Patrick's done a lot of work
on it we've both worked to validate each
other's work and make sure that
everything looks accurate that's
obviously the number one concern that's
why things take quite a while for us
because we're sort of just I mean I'm
personally overly paranoid about making
sure we have good data you can't always
hit that mark but we're pretty good
about hitting the mark so anyway tests
add a GCC compile so we've had the new
compiler collection to the testing those
of you who have wanted programming
benchmarks and air quotes they're
programming we have added a compile
benchmark for you so thank you for the
suggestion it was an excellent idea and
we have it in the tests we're very happy
about that all of this is still in
Windows I know a lot of you work in
Linux I'm sorry we just we don't have a
fluid way to work that into the bench in
right now so forgive me on that we're
work with me there but we've added
compile testing in Windows we're using a
flag in it that allows the maximum
threads to be spawned as allowed by the
CPU so we see some really interesting
scaling with things like Rison with h
EDT Intel and so forth and that's one of
our new tests we also Adobe Premiere has
been consistently added now we've done
premiere tests in the past but we have
always dropped the ball on it where
we'll do it for like the 31 75 X thread
Ripper we did those we might have done
it for like one of the I 9s before that
I think the 79 80 X E but we were never
consistent and it's because of a lot of
while issues with the project files were
may be inconsistent where they would
crash and that would happen enough where
the renders just we couldn't get them
done in a timely fashion for review so
we fixed that we have a very streamlined
adobe premiere set of benchmarks now
including 1080p 60 show floor coverage
so that's a realistic use case it's all
a roll and b-roll and we have shot on
the UX 180 we also have a charts
benchmark it's getting scrapped but it's
still really used in for interesting
data and we'll show you why in the
workstation benchmark video and then we
have a and charts benchmark is just it's
literally just all of our charged with
the animations and everything it's it's
really intensive and then we also have a
final one that's a 4k 68 roll and b-roll
shot and they are currently all h.264 if
there's popular demand we might add age
to 65 it's it's really slow I don't know
if it scales linearly with h.264 but we
do have h.264 and then we've added Adobe
Photoshop consistently 7-zip compression
and decompression really interesting
data for that one especially
decompression it behaves differently
from compression in terms of the the CPU
hierarchy so that's really cool and then
we've also added v-ray and I think
there's a couple of other ones that I am
presently forgetting but yeah really fun
workstation benchmarks coming up target
release date for that we're looking at
hopefully April 16th or 17th so that's
gonna be this week and definitely look
forward to that
after that we have Ajit GP sorry CPU GaN
CPU
benchmark overhaul we've been running
the same games for a long time now in
CPUs it's time to change that and that
is getting updated target date for
publication before end of April so most
the tests are done at this point I need
to personally go through them and and
validate and make sure just just like
look at the charts make sure they look
accurate and see if we need to rerun
anything and once we feel good about
that we'll finish the script you know
and get that up so that has now 15 total
combinations of games it's not that many
games we're still sticking with the
approach of just I mean the size of the
operation and and the amount of stuff we
try to do and very content stuff like
that
we just we try to restrict the games to
ones that we think provide a pretty wide
view of what the gaming landscape looks
like so we have RTS we have grand
campaign we have turn-based strategy we
have first-person shooter style games
and they're racing games so we've kind
of got one of everything in there and we
we try to pick most of the api's as well
so we have dx11 dx12 for sure so we
don't go too crazy on them but there's
15 total combinations which is more than
we normally do occasionally we'll drop
games as we go so a little bit of behind
the scenes knowledge for you part of the
secret is that because of how games
update these days you there's really no
offline gaming anymore if the most part
because of how they update throughout a
lifecycle of our bench we will drop
games as we go if it gets to a point
we're like oh I don't know 6 updated and
now the numbers are no longer accurate
to gameplay and when we run a new CPU
for that might be a worse cpu
objectively than an old one we've run
it's performing better and that's
because of the update if that happens we
drop the game and we don't bring it back
until we can rerun all to get all the
CPUs on that bench so that's part of the
secret for why we start with a lot of
combinations cuz we do drop them as the
bench ages because we keep our data for
as long as possible and and that's part
of that so 15 total combinations by
combinations I mean we're doing two
resolutions at 1080p 1440 and one of
those games only tests on one
resolutions sip 6 because doesn't matter
turn time case testing methodology
updates this one is tricky I'm hopeful
that we can get the first update live
like public by end of April and this is
we've had two things we're adding here
one of them is we're adding noise
normalize testing this is a very popular
part of our CPU cooler reviews it's well
liked it's a popular part of our GPU
cooler reviews and what we do is we we
set it so that there is a fixed the
noise level for every device that goes
through the bench CPU coolers and GBS
are the best examples GPU coolers and
when we set a fixed noise levels
typically about 40 DB it's gonna be
different for cases and what that does
is it allows us to eliminate some of the
concerns so if we test two CPU coolers
seeping cooler a a CPU cooler B let's
actually it's just picked some real ones
EVGA c LC series has like 2000 2500 rpm
fans that there's 2500 rpm fans on the
CL c 240 that's ridiculous I don't I
don't remember the exact noise level off
top my head but it's it's well over 50
DBA and that gets loud I think it's a
one of the coolers for sure as
approaching 60 and so the problem there
is a CLC 240 now is going to look like
one of the best products on the bench
it'll look better than two 80s and
technically it is from flat-out
performance but in reality it's you
might have something that's a little bit
warmer but not that much and is
operating at like 40 DB a and then the
EVGA SCLC 240 might be more than two
times perceived to the human ear noise
level higher that's not fair
so it's not it's not fair to the quieter
one to say the louder one's better
because duh like that's how it works so
that's why we have noise normalized
testing where we set a fixed noise level
we test it at that noise level and
everyone's leveled for the same
efficiency how well do you push air
through radiator and how well do you
move liquid at a given noise level level
playing field how does everyone do it's
a great testing methodology we're really
happy with it especially for GPU coolers
it's hard to do for cases and we'll talk
about the reasons why in that video but
there are a lot of challenges with this
we've gotten it worked out reasonably
well for cases we're still kind of going
through the numbers right now running
new tests on new cases or well old cases
that were retesting so anyway we're I'm
sure of how that will work out but we
will have data for it nonetheless and
hopefully this is a reliable testing
metric for cases that we can keep going
forward because that bench has been the
same for a while now our last change was
to add blender change before that was to
add firestrike and that's on top of the
torture testing so we already have and I
I think this is fair to say the most
thermally comprehensive testing for
cases but we want to do more I know you
all requested so no noise normalizes
next you've also very frequently
requested normalized fan solution
testing where we take a case and we have
a set of maybe three fans let me put
those in like every single case they
have to fit all of them otherwise it's
no good they have to go in the same
spots or it's no good and and do the
test and see who's got the best like
design if you if you normalize for the
fan that's hard like really difficult
because you start anything up with
scenarios where just it's not fair like
the age 500 be mesh great example in
order to fit one fan to all cases we
need a 120 or 140 you start using cases
that come with two hundreds the reason
people buy them is because they come
with two hundreds and you replace the
fans if it performs worse now that's
it's really not fair it's not realistic
and it's not a great test but there are
a lot of cases where that is a fair
thing to do the fractal mesh the five
cases are a good example of this where
they come pretty bare-bones
and there are plenty of other mid-tower
competitors that NZXT age 500 is an
interesting one because if you change
the stock configuration as we showed in
our review you can actually make the
performance a lot worse this is the same
for the Q 500 l as well by the way but
anyway we're adding that in it might be
a one-off test piece it might be
permanent methodology it'll depend on on
how the cases look and if they are if
it's like it may well come out where the
test results are me on camera saying
look this is why we haven't done this
and let me just address the request
here's the data here's why it doesn't
really make sense
or it could be like this is awesome we
have some really cool tests and we can
add to cases so we'll see how that goes
target date for that end of April for at
least one of those two things and then
GN storage overhaul and compression
server build this will be short end of
April is the goal for this we have a
dual slot duo like 79 socket server sort
of that we've been working on and it's
going to be used for video file
compression we're doing a video on it
just kind of for fun so you'll see that
end of April that'll be more of an
internal change than an external one but
we will have a content piece on it PC
build live stream and OC live stream so
we do have a PC build stream we're doing
in the next couple of weeks
OC streams we're in talks with Joe step
on Z again computed hardware who's who
was our special guest overclocker but
liquid nitrogen with him last time we're
hoping to hit a first week of May for a
live stream with him and if he can't do
it he's in Florida so if he can't do it
because of logistics then we'll
reschedule and I'll do something that
week instead so we'll have a stream a
couple of them in the next few weeks
it's just a matter of is anyone there
with me on the stream Patrick's likely
joining me for the stream of the PC
build and we're probably going to open
whatever fan mail we have left in the
box while we do that stream so that's
all first we can may hopefully and we
might end up before it if we're ahead of
schedule getting back into closed-loop
liquid cooler agree view is we already
started this we do this with the H 159
Platinum it's been a while since we've
done CLC reviews we have a big chart of
them and it's just it's time to update
so we started this one already but we're
adding the Alpha cool unit the Ice Bear
is it extreme the name escapes me right
now but we're adding that new alpha cool
unit and we're also testing our first
Swift AK product we've ever tested by
the second week of May for CLC reviews
more quality checks added for GN
the target date for this to really start
happening as June so the way this the
pipeline works videos get finished and I
watch the whole video and in that
process will often make chain
there are issues we've run into where
depending on where I watch it there
might be something on on the YouTube
side of things after processing we've
had really weird issues in the past that
it's theirs
I can't replicate them it's happened
twice well upload a video and then just
like one clip is missing audio is just
gone and then in the render file it's
there so we have no idea what hat it's
only happened twice it's a low percent
one of the times the video was published
and it was actually the principal
technologies video was taken down within
like 30 minutes was one of the hardest
decisions related to content that I made
that year because like oh my god this is
a huge piece and I have to delete it and
everyone's gonna think that it's like
some threat from PT so anyway that was
an issue so quality checks happening I
currently checked the videos when
they're done and make changes or require
or a request that the video editors make
changes and that's kind of it but this
pipeline has become really burdensome
for me because my time is limited I'm
the biggest bottleneck in the operation
and I would like to resolve that as much
as is realistic and part of what we're
going to do is I am requesting the video
editors to look over each other's work
more going forward as well so not just
we've kind of learned that instead of
the person who made the video going back
over it for quality checking to have the
other person do it and vice versa
because then it makes sense you're not
sitting there looking at like the same
damn thing for the whole day and then
then you have to look over it again
you're gonna miss the things that you
missed the first time because your
brains filling in the gaps kind of like
if you're typing and you leave out a
word and you do a proofread you might
not even notice it you need someone else
to do that pass so that's one of the
changes we're doing it's an internal
change Keegan has been the longest
standing active person working with GN
working for GN and in June when he has
some more availability he's not
full-time but in June he's going to be
more full-time and
that will be a big move so he'll be in
part of a quality checking role and his
job will be look through the video make
sure it meets our guidelines for
accuracy to whatever degree he's
knowledgeable in and primarily his job
will be make sure it meets the editing
guidelines we don't have any uncovered
Clips that need to be covered we don't
have any like poorly scaled hardware
news screen grabs or something or once
it's uploaded to YouTube make sure the
processing looks good stuff like that so
that'll be part of his job mine will be
more on the accuracy side but he'll do a
bit of that and then that'll be good
just for improving the quality of the
content it can always be better it's
it's like I think it is fair to say the
content quality is pretty high but there
are definitely things like one of the
recent news videos where it was just the
resolution was terrible on the screen
grabs and that wasn't on us ultimately
it was captured at 8k but it was on us
because we didn't catch it when we
uploaded it to YouTube it got killed and
in the in the processing I guess and
when we reload it it was fine but it was
too late because it's public so we're
trying to prevent that type of thing
going forward a new product launch
Gyan new product launch similar to the
mod matt in that it's very custom I wish
I could tell you what it is right now
but I need to I need to quality check it
first before I make an announcement on
this one so we're really excited about
it this thing has the the product has
taken us about a year to get done a lot
of kind of like the medium mod Matt took
us about that same time period I think
it's it's a lot of samples and working
with the factories we had to customize
this product a lot more than expected so
the factory did some unique tooling work
for us we'll talk about this more later
but anyway it's a new GM product we're
hoping to launch this one in May it
should be it's it's already shipped from
the factory it is coming to us now so
we're hoping for May and again this is
kind of like in terms of being a custom
product it's it's mod matte level it's
it's not like we took a shirt and
printed on it
we have those really cool custom shirts
too but this was still even more work
those were their like custom sewing
shirts and stuffs it's more work than
that so we're very excited about it I am
I'm nervous in my excitement because
with the new product like this you
always are you know these are big orders
this one in particular is the the
biggest order I've ever placed because
the minimum order quantity was very high
it's the most amount of money I've ever
in my life spent in a single transaction
it's a little scary but I'm very excited
about it and that will come out in May
is our goal for the new product newbie
role set this is our set we have another
set kind of right there and that is the
live-streaming set you've seen it before
likely in our live streams and we've
done some builds there too the SGI
system with patrick that was done there
it's just it's better for two people but
we have kind of a dead corner in the
room it's over there not that that
necessarily means anything but there's
there's a corner over there that doesn't
really get used it's got a tall table
and two chairs and I've sat at it like
twice I don't only use the table in the
kitchen when we like sit down to eat or
something so that corner is just not
really used and I kind of realized at
this table that table to end up with
just stuff on them all the time from
projects we have and it would better
enable the video team it's it's two
things here to take shots when these
tables are filled on a special table
only for them that I never fill with
stuff and two it's good for for the
video team because it gives them a new
location that's different and aesthetic
then both of these are like workshop
style industrial style sets with a lot
of electronics so we're doing something
a bit different in the other corner this
is partly a creative move I've allowed
the video team to take control of this
project it's one of the first times I've
done that where I basically I said okay
Josh and Andrew you guys are in charge
figure out what goes in the corner send
me links within a budget I'll buy it and
then we'll build it together so the
first time I've really done that I'm
excited about it they they count with a
great plan and I'm hopeful that this is
a move that will allow
the people who work here to have some
more creativity take some more unique
shots you know prevent things from
becoming stale so that's part of that
move that target is this week we're
gonna build that this week and you'll
start seeing it probably next week maybe
we need some shots obviously first no
let's see next one helping our
distributor move into his space for a GN
product fulfillment so our distributor
is the person who ships all of our store
merch so the store documents Nexus
dotnet website that has shirts it's got
the mod mats the mouse pads I'll just
plug a few things while I'm here beer
glass is all that stuff there's one guy
who does that and he's a good friend of
mine and we did a video before of
helping him build out a house that he
works out of it worked out of as of last
week builded up to a point where he
could do more efficient product
fulfillment and he mostly just does it
for us but he's expanding trying to add
new clients so this is really cool it's
it's to small businesses that both
started in a house were friends and
start working together and now he's also
moving out of his moving into an office
so we both had the same path it's really
cool to see that he is moving and we are
helping him move in in the next week or
two we might have a video on that
there's already a video on the patreon
behind-the-scenes section so if you want
to see what the new warehouse looks like
it's not mine it's not like jion's
warehouse this is our distributors
warehouse he's paying for it but but we
are occupying a significant space of it
and so it's kind of cool and we'll help
him move in moving back to two to four
patreon behind-the-scenes videos we have
been inconsistent in the past couple of
months with these but we've gotten
consistent again in the last three or
four weeks now so we just I just today
uploaded it behind the scenes video of
that warehouse I uploaded one 10 days
ago with Patrick on a do like 79 system
build I uploaded one a week before that
so we're finally getting back into
things with the patreon
behind-the-scenes videos you can go to
patreon.com/scishow
would like to get access to our discord
with all of the other people like you in
it or access to our behind the scenes
videos so thank you for bearing with me
we've gotten consistent on it again it's
just been a lot of growing pains and
we've as we've gotten some help from
Josh and others it's it's really started
picking back up only a couple more here
growing the side channel so there's
another channel we have called GN Steve
which is names because I wasn't sure
what to do with it and other than being
used for patreon behind the scenes stuff
that's unlisted unless you're a backer
and sometimes we'll set one public every
now and then but other than that I've
been uploading some viking videos to it
so downhill mountain biking is a big
thing in my life
it's or local mountain biking if I can't
go downhill on a weekend that is what
allows me to continue working hard helps
keep motivated stuff like that so doing
some videos over there of that and of
the bikes I've done custom bike builds
much like custom PC builds so that
channel is something that we're growing
it's not gonna just be biking right now
it is but like I have a video review I'm
going to do of snowflakes that you know
the cat from the house of snowflakes
water fountain high water and so she
will star in that video but that'll be
on the GN Steve side channel so
definitely subscribe to that if you're
interested in less technical well not
like electronics tech content but bike
tech or biking or I don't know cats and
that stuff will go over there so GN
Steve is the side channel for that we
are focusing hard this year on growing
that one
I'm not diverting time from G n so I'm
basically taking like six hours a week
and working on that channel and that's
my time budget if I can't do it in at
that time then I have to figure out
something else like bring it on some of
the help internally for GN to that one
but anyway that is the current plan so
we're posting we I I guess really
posting every Sunday for that one
clearing the review shelf needs to
happen there's a lot of stuff on there
we're working through a bunch of
products right now it'll take us a
little while but we're going to clear it
off and then start getting back into
into other content so I just I want to
get all those obligations out of the way
lots more planned so have to get
organized and tackle all that stuff and
then rebuilding the website in the forum
I almost have this done every time we do
a website update I do it on December
24th 25th and 26th and I work on the
25th to really get the new server and
the website dialed because I know that's
the day when the fewest people are
accessing the website historically so
close so close to getting it done and it
just it was like almost ready to go live
there were a few more things I was
unhappy with and so then we hit CES and
that was it like schedules ruined so I'm
there's a slope point in the year every
year for about two weeks in December
that's my time to work on updating the
website and we're update methodology or
whatever and we missed the window we
almost got there but this is something
I'm taking really seriously at this
point so the websites what started us
YouTube is a much bigger part of our
business now at the merch store is a big
part of our business but the website has
has remained a place to post scripts to
post written reviews and the post Eric's
news roundups things like that I would
like to get it back into full operation
it's not been as much of a focus the
last six months or so as I would have
liked because YouTube's grown so much
for us but we need it there
one for a safety net because YouTube is
scary - I really like written content
personally I like writing it and I like
reading it and so I would like the
website to kind of be in full operation
it can do a lot more than it is and the
other thing too is if you kind of look
at the market a lot of technical writers
have left they've gone to companies
Intel mostly Andy to some extent and
with this exodus of writers there's a
big a big demand that's being filled by
fewer sites so we would like to meet
that demand to the extent that we can we
can't fill the shoes of a lot of these
people but we can fill some of the shoes
and they might be the wrong size but
we'll fill them nonetheless so the ho
is to get the website really back up and
running the forum we it kind of hurt but
we had the forum for you it was the
first thing I made was the forum since
like two thousand seven or eight we had
it for over a decade and then I
deactivated it last year because the
spam was getting so bad and we didn't
have moderators and I wasn't checking it
because the website is is such a
band-aid mess the way it's held together
because over a decade old that it was
just it was difficult to maintain
so I disabled the forum because the spam
was getting bad and we've rebuilt it I
have like an internal version of the new
forum that works better and it's very
similar to the Linus tech tips forum
it's the same back end just in our style
the website has had a template rebuild
but it's stuck I'll do it but I just
need time so end of July is my hopeful
target for that one all these other
dates I've given you are very realistic
that one is the biggest question mark
I'm gonna try hard to that date I really
hope we do would like to add a a
graphene engine as well so we can
generate the charts in the site and not
do pngs anymore to just I mean just to
make the charts better so anyway I know
there's a long video this is really only
meant for people who really like our
content and want to know what we're up
to you you really like our stuff and for
that we are eternally grateful thank you
and for people who have donated money to
us have purchased from our store anyone
who's supported us in any way watching
the content you know commenting even
something as simple as retweeting or
buying merch from us paying on patreon
to help us we are just trying to keep
you in the loop so that's a road map for
the next couple of months all the way
through July couple small things will be
at Commonwealth small things this is not
a small thing we got coffee tax the
biggest thing actually the next couple
of months will be a copy tags so just
got back from China Taiwan for the the
trip so we did Taiwan first then we did
China
back to Taiwan and then we left we did
that for all those factory tours and I
have more still that we can publish but
it started feeling too much like this
coverage how so he went back to testing
content
we're going back to Taiwan and China in
late May early June for Computex and I'm
gonna go with Keegan over to Shenzhen
the other guys will stay in Taiwan
Keegan I'll make a video there that we
have planned it's gonna be really fun
that video and we're making some more
stuff like while we're traveling of the
locale and I'm really excited about that
so it's just it's fun and it's
interesting and it's all electronics
related so anyway we have a lot of stuff
LTX after that and there's gonna be the
next two big ones so yeah thank you for
bearing with me through this for those
of you who watch this far I don't I'm
not gonna recap this you got the idea
there's a lot of cool stuff coming up I
greatly appreciate your patience and
support
I know we've missed some deadlines in
the years as everyone does but we are
finally getting a handle back on things
again I mean you you have to realize
like just how hard it is to manage time
of other people especially and try and
hit all these these targets so we got in
there
get in there I'm still doing like I
don't know 70 to 100 hours a week
depending on the week for realistic
range so time management not the only
problem physical allowance of time is
the other problem we're working on it
thank you for watching subscribe for
more I'm sure you are if you watched
this boring video if you want to support
us directly go to store that gamers
Nexus dotnet and consider purchasing at
one of our shirts or if you feel like
spending a bit more on something custom

about 10 days thanks for watching I'll
