on the Massif IC and its success by
taking an existing case design which
took an existing case design and
iterating upon the iteration so the
fractal define that's to match finds
what we're reviewing today it has a few
improvements over the existing s2 which
had some tweaks to the existing r6 which
uses the same base chassis and this is
sort of what fractal does they find
something people really like and then
they just don't really deviate from it
in fact just changing the front panel
the the mesh front panel was a huge deal
for the mesh if I see when that first
came out so we are now looking at that
application to a different chassis
slightly different the s2 instead and
just gonna see how it improves or
changes versus the s2 non mattify that
we criticized when it launched before
that this video is brought to you by the
EVGA CLC 280 liquid cooler people ask me
how I keep cool during the summer with
all this hair well I've tried a lot of
different products and few do exactly
what I need many of them cause tangles
or worse EVGA CLC 280 helps keep my core
temperatures lower they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
so intro pretty much got you up to speed
this is like stated it's it's an s2
which is an r6 with some changes and if
you want the full details on what the s2
is you can check our s2 review and then
that review will refer you to our hour 6
review for the full details of the
internals but the very basics here this
is a $150 enclosure it's like 140 if you
don't go with the glass panel it has a
dark tint option it's got a white color
paint option a black paint option and
then a steel panel option but basically
$150 case and all variants are this
except just different types of colors
and side panel so clearly it's got mesh
on the front that's kind of the whole
deal if you already know the s2 then you
know this just it's the front is
different so not really many other ways
to state that I think the top still has
the sort of
Thayne except now it's mesh instead of a
big piece of steel and this is all part
of the design where fractal is trying to
sort of accommodate a slightly different
market and they've done a pretty good
job at this with a mesh if I see two two
fractals credit and it's a bit of a
reach out into the airflow market
without deviating too much from fractals
core philosophies which very clearly
seem to be no-nonsense and just about
all of the the cases fractal makes it's
very strictly business and that remains
true with this case it's just that it's
it got a bit more breathing room in the
front so we have some pretty unique
tests here we for example take the new
lightweight filter out of the front
there's a really fine mesh filter behind
the steel mesh and it adds another layer
of filtration we don't really like
doubling up on filters because it
affects their flow negatively but this
one is so thin that it's worth testing
separately to see how well it does
there's really not a lot that I can do
here on camera we typically kind of go
through this segment of like walk you
through all the things on the case but
it's the s2 we already did that and then
we did it before with arsenic so it'd be
the third time we've done that now let's
just let's just go straight into the
testing we've got some billed notes from
Patrick to talk about first he talked
about the changes that have been made to
the case structurally or in terms of
panels things like that I'll talk
through those and then we'll get into
the performance testing and the
conclusion we wrote this section for the
define our six back in 2017 and added
some additional comments with the s2 and
2018 there's not much else to say in
2019 so limit ourselves to more
meaningful changes check the original r6
review or well the s2 review to read
additional information on the build and
the internal layout almost all of the
changes are in the front panel here it's
exactly the same front panel as on the
mesh of IC but scaled up slightly the 50
larger s2 and when we say exactly the
same we mean it
other than the USBC port on the i/o
panel even the decorative geometric
design is identical to the measure of IC
is just a bit larger that's not a bad
thing but it is strange that factor
would gear up to make what is it from a
manufacturing point
of you an entirely new panel without
updating the design at all that I guess
says that the design was popular the
duplication means that negative features
of the massif icees panel have carried
over to the mesh of 5s to the i/o is
built into the top edge so that removing
the front panel pulls the cables with it
this is sort of an old legacy way to do
front panels and not something we like
to see in the non mesh define s2 or see
the front IO is built into a separate
unit that's then screwed into the
chassis
since unclipping the front filter must
be done from the inside of the panel and
the inside of the panel is difficult to
reach without removing the whole front
of the case it adds a minor layer of
inconvenience to cleaning the front
filter one other subtle change was made
from the older Meza Phi which is that
the layer of filtration foam backing the
steel mesh has much wider pores and is
it less restrictive to airflow this foam
is held against the uneven steel surface
with spacers built into the plastic
frame which is a thoughtful touch the
top panel is exactly the same as the
front but without the decorative pattern
of the bends in the normal s2 the cover
is a steel plate that can be removed to
leave just a filter so in a way the
Metro Phi's cover is less versatile but
it doesn't look better than the defined
s twos Bayer filter filter and exhaust
is sort of counterproductive and users
who don't intend to use a top intake
configuration should consider stripping
the foam off for this cover but it's
nice to have the option of using it the
springs if you can call them that on the
top fan mount that lift the top cover
appear to be bent upwards further than
they were in the r6 and define s2 so the
panel actually does pop up a bit more
when the release button on the rear of
the case is pressed this still is in two
great systems and sit marries a nice and
presumably expensive spring-loaded
button with crude Springs punched out of
the case material that don't work as
well as they really should still we've
talked about this twice already and the
slight improvement in this version means
that there's a chance fractal is
listening to feedback we'd still like to
see this mechanism work better though
other than that the final minor point of
interest was that the fans were not
connected to the fan hob out of the box
we don't use fan hubs or controllers for
testing anyway if we can avoid it but
users will
to make sure to sort of fruit around for
the fan cables and plug them in before
tying everything down moving into
thermal and noise testing now for
additional tests we removed the mesh
section of the front panel effectively
removing the front panel we tried
putting the seal the top cover from the
define s2 on top of the case and it did
fit and we did a test with the layer of
foam removed from the front panel just
to see if it obstructs air intake in any
meaningful way when compared to just the
mesh front panel without that foam we're
not too enthusiastic about layering
filters on top of filters but this one
is at lighter weight than the original
mesh if icees was and the metruff IC did
fine and testing there was nothing
unusual about the vertical GPU mount and
Fraxel doesn't include a PCIe riser
cable so we didn't really bother testing
it to be honest we know how these
perform at this point you've seen the
numbers and if you haven't been checked
almost any of our previous case reviews
they're bad if you run a vertical GPU
that is air-cooled it will not do well
in this case if it's liquid cooled
that's a different story though starting
with only the relevant fractal cases on
the charge the S to mattify and the r6
which use the same base chassis are
within margin of error for testing
without a front panel and the error here
of course keep in mind is also
influenced by the fans because there's
some variance between fan production
runs stock CPU temperature was fifty
point seven degrees Celsius over ambient
during the torture test which dropped
down to 46 point two degrees with the
front cover removed that's a significant
change but we see much more dramatic
improvement on cases with sealed front
covers like for example the original H
500 P which went from acrylic to well
being open running with the defined s
twos a steel top cover resulted in a 50
degree Celsius measurement within margin
of error of stock the ventilation on
this top cover won't to offer any
meaningful advantage unless a radiator
or other active cooling solution is
mounted at the top of the case for
radiators obviously this is a major
improvement if you had a downdraft
cooler there might be some improvement
there to because it's got an escape path
it's going to depend on the cooler
selected but for one similar to ours no
meaningful benefit without extra cooling
mounted up top taking just the
sheet of foam out of the front cover but
leaving the front cover on we saw an
impressively large improvement down to
forty six point one degrees Celsius over
ambient effectively exactly the same as
this has tooth no front panel at all
we're within error here this second
layer of mash is obstructing and take
partially although the theoretical
benefit has reduced dust and dig so it's
a trade off there and the trade-off
isn't so bad ultimately but it is an
interesting one and if you wanted some
extra performance removing that filter
would assist it's just filters on the
top of filters make sure you keep the
steel mesh clean and don't let too much
dust accumulate on top of it you should
be fine comparatively fifty point seven
degrees Celsius over ambient is a pretty
respectable spot on the chart for a
stock case overall it's it's fine
especially since the mesh of icy landed
at fifty four point three degrees and
the define that's two was at a actually
kind of uncompetitive 57 degrees keep in
mind that we have some error baked in
here for testing so there's variance and
fan manufacturing and fan rpm run to run
which is only really relevant here
because we're looking at cases that use
effectively the same tool in the same
chassis and sometimes even the same fans
but there's about a 10% variance in
maximum fan rpm so if testing the same
style of case from one to the next like
the r6 versus s2 or the s2 burrs that's
to mattify there's going to be some
extra variance baked into there beyond
it normal so the fans and internal
layout of this s2 are the same as the
older one and most of the credit overall
to the improvement for the s2 mesh pie
goes to the new front panel design and
the lighter filter layer on the front
improving the thermals overall removing
the foam layer puts it on par with the
age 500ms close to the top of the chart
and at 46 degrees over ambience the s2
match of i stock configuration is closer
to the 1/2 x the h 500 match $100 cooler
master case and the 570 x corsair case
from a while ago GPU torture testing is
next again starting with fractal first
with no alterations to the case the
massif is two hits 55 point one degrees
over ambient GPU temperature removing
the front panel had less impact compared
to the CP attempts but lowering the
temperature a couple of degrees down to
53 degrees celsius is still noteworthy
it's not
nearly as impressive sealing the top
panel had greater effect raising it to
56 point 6 degrees over ambience there's
still not much outside of the range of
normal variance here but it could
indicate that the mesh top allow some of
the radiative heat off the backside of
the GPU to escape more readily again it
would take some top mounted fans to
really take advantage of the mesh cover
and we're sort of within error here
removing the foam layer didn't benefit
the GPU temperature at all
leaving it within variance of stock
temperature at fifty five point four
degrees Celsius taken together with the
sepia temperatures it seems like the
foam is light enough that it can do more
good than harm overall again considering
CPU performance but our preference
generally is going to be to remove it
from maximum cooling performance and
then just be diligent in your dust
cleaning for the steel mesh
comparatively 55 point one degrees GPU
temperature is just average when
considering our whole database of
results we're only showing a very small
fraction of them here for size reasons
of the chart but it's significantly
better than the defined s to 69 degree
results and better than the low fan
count stock measure of ICS with the 7.8
degree result and also better than the
define r6 is 56 point four degrees
Celsius results in that context the s2
match by is a success versus its
predecessors this removal of the front
panel doesn't wildly improve things as
we saw already it seems that the
obstacle to better GPU cooling is the
positioning of the fans the relatively
low speed and then the proximity of the
bottom of the case for instance we've
seen this before as well
comparatively again this case is just
sort of in the lower third of our
truncated list of results place it
around with the level 20 MT and age 500
piece it it's really not great overall
particularly for the mesh front but this
comes down to static pressure fans
fractal is still using fans that overall
favor silence to performance and that
shows here we'll look at that in the
noise section as well to see if it
balances out it's better than fractals
previous designs are cooling but this
does show us that a mesh front doesn't
really mean that it's instantly good
other design elements still have to line
up and power supply shrouds or krantz
GPU chambers do limit cooling potential
even when the mesh is present you see a
trend where generally larger cases with
some
hopefully higher static pressure fans do
better just because what want it takes
longer to reach steady state with that
much volume and to there's less sort of
well obstructions surrounding the GPU to
trap or reduce air and its ability to
pass through the area fire strike
extreme raise the GPU temperature to
fifty seven point seven degrees Celsius
over ambience a couple degrees higher
than the torture test that's about the
same as the throne will take g21 TG a
case that genuinely did have problems
with multiple restrictive filters lay it
on top of each other just as in the
torture test though the Mastiff is -
outperforms the define s - it
outperformed the r6 and the metruff IC
stock and it's really it's it's still
bordering on bad when stock but the user
is fortunately given enough tools to
work with the performance right out of
the box and you just have to make sure
you choose the right coolers and the
right fans to really bring this case to
its full potential they asked to mattify
set up for you to go it's just not
really the best out of the box despite
having a full mesh front there are
better cases for a pure coin but it's a
bit smaller and that does factor into
the cooling abilities our blender tests
are real-world workload and should be
representative of temperatures that will
be seen during single component load use
the CPU temperature during the CPU
render was thirty seven point one
degrees Celsius over ambiens which
compares favorably to the rest of our
chart but not any better than the
defined s2 and r6 we are within margin
of error of both of these with the
defined s to mattify ranking close bytes
that divine s2 and the r6 again this is
one a limitation of the reduced heat
load generated by this task because it's
not using the extreme heat of the
torture test where the differences of
well-ventilated and sealed front panels
are highlighted more sharply but also
it's potentially an impact from the fan
variation from run to run so in this
single device workload for demonstration
the define s2 metruff is entrie aliy
impressive in any way it's not it's not
outperforming the previous cases but
it's also reduced heat load and it's not
bad either the GPU render a verdict Rees
on the GPU again that's better than any
of the previous fractal cases in turn
gpo temperatures but not exceptional on
the whole fractal deserves credit for
improving the thermals of their existing
case design and the case isn't going to
do any harm to GPUs but it seems that
the stock metruff is - isn't the best
suited enclosure for air-cooled GPUs
acoustics have the case at 37.7 DBA
which is about where the SL 600m sits
and that was a sort of silence focused
case it's really not bad for a more open
airflow oriented case fractals doing
well here to balance out some of the
performance numbers we saw with a lower
DBA measurement than some of the other
cases that are opened in the front and
that's largely phan twice by fractal the
company is trying to find that balance
between its profile as being sort of
no-nonsense and quiet and then
performance which is desirable at this
point this is ranking on the acoustics
chart reasonably well overall it's not
extremely impressive but it's got the
decent balance and so for that we can
give it a good mark the case overall
it's really not bad it's a pretty good
step for fractal it achieves what
fractals set out to achieve which seems
to be on average slightly at least if
not significantly in some cases better
performance than the original as to
which we really genuinely didn't like it
just it didn't have that much of a place
yes it had some things that it did kind
of uniquely kind of well like a bit more
water cooling support but overall it was
not a new case it felt very familiar to
all the other cases so this improves in
a lot of ways over the s2 non Meza Phi
it is a modified version of the r6 which
we actually quite liked so the problem
we had with s2 was at the end of the day
our conclusion was well you should buy
either the r6 with s2 whichever one is
cheaper because for the most part they
were about the same yeah there's some
differences and we can show some of
those but overall the cases weren't all
that different that remains true here
but the front panel is a significant
change and the thermals show that now
the thermals aren't always better in low
heat load scenarios like just running
blender on the CPU we end up with
differences that are completely within
margin of error completely within
variants for the fans you have to
remember that the fans that come on
these cases aren't identical they are
all plus or minus about
10% rpm it's a pretty wide range for fan
manufacturing this normally doesn't
really matter all that much until you're
testing cases from the same manufacturer
with the same fan that are the same
tooling because then it's not really
strictly like for like it's pretty damn
close but in cases where in instances I
should say where you have low heat loads
the differences don't quite emerge in
the same way as in high heat load
scenarios like the torture loads we do
so is the case actually worth it well at
$150 that's pretty fierce competition
that's a high asking price it comes with
three fans that's not particularly
impressive on its own and the fans
aren't really the best they're not bad
they're better than most stock fans but
they're not impressive either so that's
not enough to set it apart to set it
apart a mesh panel also isn't enough I
guess it's the combination of things
it's the combination of if fractals got
a specific audience that they target and
if you're part of that audience well
then there's a new match case for you
and if you like that there's really not
much we need to say to change your
opinions because fractal has that core
audience and so we're we have no reason
to really communicate with that core
audience if you like it that's fine you
can pick it up if you want if you're in
the middle though it's a bit difficult
because that's sort of the larger end of
things you can look at maybe the H 500 P
mesh which is a same priced case that on
average is better in a lot of scenarios
or minimally tied and it's it's a bit
more space to work with
it has uniquely the two 200 millimeter
front fans that does kind of have some
other restrictions you can check our
review on that but it's bigger and
that's either a positive or a negative
depending on your viewpoint of those
form factors other cases in the price
class that are extremely competitive
would be the NZXT h 700 which is
actually that case up there you can get
the non aversion without the smart
device and it's cheaper it's about 150
bucks so it's a direct competitor to
this price varies of course depending
when we fill them but in terms of strict
features the h 709 i then the dumb
version does have more features overall
than the fractal case it's got some
pretty cool cable management
capabilities it's more advanced in that
department something NZXT specializes in
the aesthetics very different so that
it's going to be subjective but it kind
of makes this look very just sort of
standard standard issue there's not much
special about it and that's fine that's
practicals audience but if you're
looking for flash and for flavor you're
really not gonna get it with this case
so to give you a firm conclusion it is
fine it's thermally it's improved over
the s2 on average if it's you know with
the high heat load scenarios where it
matters it is improved significantly it
is on average improved over the r6 these
are good things
the acoustics haven't changed all that
much it's a bit louder but not
disproportionately so it is actually if
you kind of wait the the thermals versus
the noise it's improved in Cadi both
categories reasonably with the noise not
really increasing all that much so the
case has done well iteratively it is
just we would have no problem buying it
at 150 bucks if not for the very stiff
competition at this price point so this
is a case that is pretty easy to buy
probably in the 120 130 dollar and 150
it's it's not unreasonable you have to
remember fractal there's lower volume
and these other companies their MO their
prices are going to be a bit higher
because they're not ordering as much but
yeah I mean there's just there's a lot
of choices on the market so in terms of
cases to consider we would consider this
one among the top sort of maybe five to
six in the $150 price class along the
NZXT HS 700 and the coolermaster h 500 p
mesh so those would be really good
considerations in the same price class
it's just you know once you kind of
narrow it down to those three foster -
maybe one more it's just up to you to
figure out what you like looking at
because it can be sitting next to you
