nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
the revolution of virtual reality
technologies including a are
technologies which after decades of
advancement they are finally starting to
break into the consumer market and this
video serves as a roundup of the
emergent technologies on the consumer
end right now including the head mounted
display oculus rift physical input
device the omni treadmill and one-to-one
motion tracking device the stem system
I'll also briefly cover the other side
of the coin augmented reality in the
form of cast AR for a history of virtual
reality and Industry Analysis hit the
article link in the description below
where I talking great depth about the
history of VR and AR up until now let's
start with introducing different devices
that are out right now and as shown on
the screen you can see the major three
technologies being combined to create a
more immersive gaming experience what
you're looking at here is the fusion of
the Omni that'd be the the treadmill
component the rift which is the head
mounted display or hmd and the stem
system which is the motion tracking
technology attached to the demonstrators
peripherals his legs his arms and so
forth let's talk about each of these
systems at work starting with the Omni
the Omni or omnidirectional treadmill
was kick-started at 1.1 million dollars
and is being developed by virtuix and
the Omni uses custom shoes on a low
friction grooved surface to track the
user's physical movement as input the
device can be tuned for individual games
so you can set the input speed and it's
in game translation if you wanted to do
a one-to-one conversion of physical
movement to effectively WASD why is the
movement that could be set up the idea
here is to replace the tried-and-true
WASD with physical movement so it's not
exactly ideal for competitive play and
if you're the type of gamer who wants to
come home and sit down and relax it
might not work for you either but it
makes for excellent immersion
opportunities and exercise opportunities
the Omni is equipped with a support bar
and harness to keep the user in place
when fully head mounted and can be
easily dismantled and stowed away it
costs around five hundred dollars far
cheaper than a traditional treadmill if
you're making that compares
and is natively supported by any game at
sports traditional keyboard input when
speaking to a mere Reuben of six cents
the company that's developing the stem
system he stated that quote the Omni has
potential to revolutionize the home
exercise equipment market and I think
he's got a point my question to him was
you know is this kind of expensive it's
500 bucks and personally yes it's it's a
fair price in terms of what you're
getting it is actually fair but it's
about half the cost of a high-end gaming
machine and so relatively speaking of
this it is fairly expensive the problem
with this line of thinking Rubin said is
that I'm making the comparison to
strictly gaming devices when I should be
comparing it to other more equivalent
examples like a treadmill the Omni uses
software to convert physical steps into
keystrokes but is also an open
development platform so game developers
can work more closely with the Omni team
virtuix on a software level if they
wanted to the Omni consists of shoes
special shoes the octagonal platform
itself and a support harness and moving
to the stem system now the stem system
is a it's being developed by six ends
first of all and it's a series of motion
tracking modules that produce a one to
one real world to virtual world input
conversion if you move one degree up and
one millimeter to the side with this
device in your hand it'll track and
convert that to in-game movement the
system is comprised of a base which
handles all the logic and processing and
signals the wireless tracking modules it
also includes up to five individual
stems which are modules that can be
equipped to peripherals the users legs
arms waist head all of which serve as
points for more accurate in game
movement the stem modules am stem system
support full six degrees of freedom
tracking so it is six axis tracking the
stem module contains a battery and
wireless transmitter and can be
connected to custom peripherals so if
you've got a 3d printed plastic gun with
a slot for a stem the stem can be
inserted and the gun will now be
movement tracked and and relayed to the
game so when you move your gun up and
down it will move appropriately in game
six senses the original supplier behind
razors Hydra interface so they've got
some experience the Hydra was wired but
the new stem system will be fully
wireless and modular which is a pretty
big deal when you're looking at
combining it with other tech like the
Omni and finally oculus rift I'll talk
briefly about cast they are after this
the rift is likely already known by most
of you it's a modern head mounted
display or hmd that allows full
immersion and a wider field of view the
rift has a diagonal fov of 110 degrees
pretty close to our full human fov of
around 180 degrees and will ship with a
1080 display in the full consumer
version special lenses are used to help
create the wide fov effect and give the
appearance that the game world sort of
wraps around the consumers peripheral
vision providing better overall
immersion and player presence within the
game this is in contrast to old HMDs
from more than a decade ago in some
cases back to the 60s which I used a
more square for the three type aspect
ratio or similar and it was kind of a
the display was off in the distance so
it was really sort of isolating and
oculus rift has arguably champions the
resurgence of VR technology in modern
times given it's almost too perfect
feature set and expansion on hmd
technology which has sort of been a dead
space for about a decade now and HMDs of
course being the head mounted display
with the actual visual component are
naturally a bit more popular because
that's kind of what science fiction has
popularized so that is now going to be
available it looks like about next year
sometime it's already available for
developers as with the stem and omni the
rift is an open development platform and
the oculus VR team is working closely
with game developers to properly
integrate their VR solution there are
several development obstacles with VR
including nausea and UI design
complexities but these are discussed in
more depth in the featured article below
one of the hurdles though is that the
rift much like most of VR is very
isolating that's ideal for gamers who
want immersion and don't want to be
interrupted but poses issues for gamers
who prefer same room local gaming with
friends or land events or something like
that this is where AR technology kind of
signs or augmented reality technology
for its preference of augmenting what
already exists rather than immersing in
a virtual world alone effectively I our
tech has been used in psychiatry and
medical fields for a number of years now
helping stroke victims and those who are
paralyzed by phobias but kast'ar is
really the first bit of gamer focused AR
tech to hit the market at an affordable
price so it's it's very
consumer-oriented rather than medical
oriented and being developed by X valve
employees kast'ar is basically a pair of
glasses that uses holography techniques
to produce a 3d holographic op a special
reflective cloth surface the glasses use
tiny projectors above each eye to
project the image onto the retro
reflective surface that ships with the
device kast'ar is also networked which
is pretty cool so if you're playing D&amp;amp;D
on a tabletop with friends and building
a dungeon for the players to explore as
a DM someone in a remote location could
network in and view the same dungeon on
their own cast AR cloth and system from
another location and as for VR it's very
impressive right now very promising
technology and I really do think that
oculus especially oculus rift has some
promise in the gaming industry and will
be fairly globally adopted as for prices
they are all very affordable given what
they offer so the prices are fair it is
about a thousand dollars to buy the
entire kit if you wanted the Omni oculus
and stem system if you just wanted to
oculus in the stem system it'd be much
cheaper by be somewhere in the five to
six hundred dollar range somewhere in
there go hit the link that description
below if you are more information on
this it has links to all the
technologies as well on page two of the
article so you can check out each
individual technology and we'll try to
follow these technologies as they begin
to hit the market next year maybe get
some hands-on videos with them and
that's all for now guys I'll see you all
next time p</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
