tectum demos and the purpose of this is
to talk about how graphics are cheated
so we'll be looking at it's some of the
technology that Nvidia showed and then
I've brought with me Andrew a your 3d
artist he does the video production and
editing for the channel yes a lot of
film work but also has significant
experience with 3d modeling 3d art and
game graphics so we're going to be
analyzing the technology shown in those
demos but also we'll be talking about
can you do these things with traditional
graphics methods and if so what's the
benefit so that's what we're like if
there is one that's what we're looking
at today
well we looking at battlefield 5 and the
global illumination demo in Metro Exodus
a couple of other games as well and
hopefully provide some insight as to
whether these things are actually
impressive or not before that this video
is brought to you by the Corsair strafe
RGB mark 2 mechanical gaming keyboard
the strafe mark 2 uses Cherry MX which
is available in MX red and MX Island and
uses the elevated key cap design that
has become part of course there's
keyboard identity elevated key caps make
the keyboard much easier to clean with a
blast of compressed air and limit dirt
build up the keyboard use a metal body
design of have received praise from us
in the past in old reviews for high
build quality learn more about the
Corsair strafe mark 2 at the link in the
description below ok so for our first
one this is a global illumination room
demo at the Nvidia event the launch
event at Gamescom Jensen's on stage and
what we have is what they're calling
traditional graphics r-tx off and before
actually know what let's just let's just
show the next frame just before I even
get into why this is not a great
representation here's what they go from
this our TX off to this so what we
different what fuck it's like it's a
cement look at the look at the objects
first of all there's some transition
there too from the slides changing so I
mean what do we where do we start with
his Andrea the object starting the same
materials yeah so he claims that or for
right now he claims that the red ball
whether the white ball of cement and the
green and video ball is like metallic
with a clear coat on it okay and Johnson
says that on stage yes something about
how the white one is supposed to be
cement material Reds leather leather ish
and material if you're not familiar
matters a lot for reflections just like
it does in real life so that's important
and then the next frame and he compares
it with a ball that's made out of glass
and while it's made of metal and adds
two more lights into the scene in which
kind of destroys the point of global
illumination in the scene and adds an
area light to the top yes so these two
are effectively non-comparable at this
point yes they are
it's not a fair comparison so everything
changed you all have seen our
benchmarking videos when you compare
things you keep as many things the same
except for the one aspect you are
comparing which here is supposed to be
global illumination and I mean that
first all the the material changes
probably most egregious change because
you're going from leather to glass which
now is involving caustics faked or
otherwise I feel like the lighting
change might be the most egregious
change because it's you can't do they
have a point light or an area light
before they had a white one panel so
they have a 60 watt bulb in the ceiling
and then they coat you six fluorescent
tubes for some reason so this is called
the point light up here yes okay and the
other one is called an area light yes
and what is the distinction why do we
you can see point lights on the stage
too
so why do we why do we call so point
light it would just be a singing their
source of light and an area light would
I guess you can't see any of the lights
it's like our diffused lights that we
have on the set I guess right an area
light is at least when we try to
calculate it digitally it's it's a lot
of point lights crammed into a space so
this area light is a lot of point lights
and and they added two more colored ones
on the side yes so what is why
what what are they trying to show I'm
really not sure they're trying to show
to be completely honest because what you
should be trying to show is the light
bouncing off of the walls onto the
objects that would be global
illumination but since there's lights on
the wall that kind of overrides any of
the bouncer that beat coming off of them
right because instead of having the
light bounce so the lights coming from
the ceiling light comes down hits the
wall isn't a typical gie demonstration
the light hits the wall bounces off the
wall in the color that the wall is
because I guess the idea is the wall
absorbs every other color right in the
spectrum so that red should be
reflecting onto the object which is now
no longer red leather it's glass but
whatever and that light is no longer red
because there's a blue light in front of
the red wall so it just makes everything
in that area
blue there's nothing really between them
that you can specifically point out and
be like give it that does look better
it's just oh these are two different
images that I'm looking at and they also
call this traditional graphics oh yeah
that is a big problem as well and I
guess the questions of the audience is
when have you played a game with quote
traditional graphics that looked this
bad when's the last time you played a
game
make it like a triple-a game making it
an honest effort to put in realistic
graphics when have they looked this bad
yeah everything is bad I feel like the
shadows are the worst part to be honest
right there's even reflection and shadow
anti-aliasing at this point - and
there's post-processing filters you can
apply to stuff right so and then the
next one I think is just jumps into the
different I think the next one he they
make the cement ball in - oh wait that's
super weird so now we have multiple area
lights what do they do this first then
we go from multiple area lights to
reflection so now we're changing the
surface material it's really kind of a
shy stayed away to try and make it look
like the material change and light
changes were all completely just a
consequence of demonstrating everything
else and not at all intentional then we
have the final refraction demonstration
we have another set of images that is
actually much better at representing
this where they have the Quadro card in
the same room right that one didn't I
couldn't be used that comparison for
this actually I think they did show that
one of the press day but not on stage I
don't think and videos big thing with
this was showing flame reflecting in the
car here and I don't know does this have
to do with screen space and plane or
reflections or what's going on yes the
thing is that this could technically be
possible with plane of reflections if
you had a large plane like right in
front of this car here that it can
sample from but otherwise if most games
just use screen space reflections
because they're a lot cheaper to
calculate and you get a bit better frame
rate that way and if they turn r-tx off
and you can see that once it's turned
off anything behind the tread gets
hidden away from what the car can see
and it's your collection just to give
everyone a primer here so planar and
screen space reflections they're not new
it's not like part of our TX or ray
tracing or anything like that it's just
different ways to reflections screen
space correct me if I'm wrong I think
the primary thing there is that what you
can see on the screen through the view
frustum is what is reflected yeah that's
accurate so if you start and I if you
look at for example an object or a
character in a mirror and the camera is
pointing towards the mirror but the
objects back is to the mirror you might
see the front of the object reflected in
that mirror instead of the back of the
object whereas planar reflections would
would sample the I guess it's got
another camera in it right it's yeah
that's the way that that plane thinks
but anyway so it's almost as if there's
another camera inside of the plane
rendering the entire scene again a
second time and then when you look at
that plane it looks at what that camera
would see from that perspective so
that's a plane of reflections work but
there are a few limitations with planet
reflection so that they can't be mapped
onto curved surfaces and also you would
have to place a plane
in front of everything that you want to
have that reflection for ya and they're
very expensive to render to in terms of
hardware requirement also Patrick
brought up an interesting point about
the windows reflection as well because
we also saw in the comments section some
people are saying like this grand theft
auto had this why is this impressive but
really if you look at grand theft auto
as Windows it's just a it's just a cube
map mapped onto all of the windows in
the game so if you so if you stand in
front of one window and look at the
reflection you'll see a building and if
you drive two miles down the road and
look into Wonder you'll see the same
building just because it's using one
image texture for all of the reflections
in all the windows but which goes into
how you can fake and cheat the graphics
right but that also goes into if someone
thought that GTA had that then it's like
well it's like is it really even a point
to putting in the real or Frek
reflections if no one even notices that
they're fake yes if everyone is fooled
by it and thanks GTA had this and
whatever other games in the past had
this I was just a cube map yeah and no
one knows any better than I don't know
what does it matter or entering a point
of just complete diminishing returns
when they show an example of the plane
and the cars reflection I've well
looking through the comments on this
video saw a lot of people talking about
how the car looks too shiny to be
realistic like they feel like r-tx is
making V is making it less realistic
than it used to be but I think by making
it look perfectly glassy right yeah and
I think that is the problem that it is
too perfectly glossy but I don't think
that's RTX is fault it's more of the
fault of the textures because it has its
roughness is too uniform so it just
looks like so it's not a roughness map
or is it the texture I guess I'd be the
same thing okay did the roughness map
would be a texture at it so that might
not be an RTX thing the shininess but
you can see that it has some like some
ripples in the surface that would be
more of like I guess would be a normal
map that they'd put in there
distort the reflections in that way and
it's possible too that they made it
overly shiny to illustrate our TX yeah
that's true until the games really out
actually I saw it one of the developers
on this game on battlefield 5 so that
they turned down the RT X for more
realism which doesn't really make any
sense because real life is 100% rate
race but whatever I'll just I thought of
a weird analogy in my head and I don't
know if it'll sound right but it's
imagine if nobody washed their clothes
they all took their clothes to a
laundromat okay
and all the laundromats wash their
clothes by hand yes I feel like Nvidia
made a tool for developers and they're
trying to sell it to gamers so it's like
they made the world's first washing
machine but no one washes their clothes
so they don't need it but the
laundromats are very excited right okay
so in other terms Nvidia has made a
business-to-business development tool
and they are trying to figure out how to
market that to gamers but we're probably
unexcited or don't understand why they
need it but you also the new washing
machines don't work with your old
clothes so you have to buy new clothes
why yes that is a common problem with
graphics hardware and with clothes yes
often often clothes and washing machines
are incompatible this is something we
need to check every time we write a
washing machine review doesn't work the
old clothes yes I feel like for the
end-user it's like like my clothes are
clean both ways so is it then is this
demo impressive
it's impressive from the standpoint of
the things that you don't have to do
when setting up light sources now so
this demo is kind of weird because it's
kind of it's it's like what I said
before it's difficult to quantify really
what's different about about this and
how it was before this is the the
biggest problem I have with all these
demos but to developers I feel like this
is this is like
it's like a new world or they don't have
to wash clothes with their hands anymore
so you can see this is a good example
like this route this short one second
part you can see right here the corner
behind the bookshelf right kind of
lights up it you can see the light
bouncing like in between both of the
walls here like back and forth and makes
a whole corner bit brighter than it
normally would be for a second but you
can also see that it's pretty noisy from
various disease er yeah so let's try to
work out what's going on with only one
sample per pixel right yeah and that is
in an video limitation - so how much
back it up so we're gonna play this one
back again and if you look closely in
that corner you'll see a decent amount
of noise and just grain and we can pop
it up on the screen and editing but and
that is from we think probably the
denoiser and the limitations how many
samples it's taken because if you played
very even if you've seen trailers of
something like the last of us even
you'll have already seen environments
that look pretty close to this so it's
it's difficult to tell really what the
difference is but we even in the
previous metro games they've done
lighting effects like this yeah like
time of day lighting is right time of
day lighting is not new right and like
coming in through windows and God raised
they're also not næss also in the
editors day they showed it off so they
did Andris off and the off demo didn't
really have any effects whatsoever so
there's kind of our TX global
illumination or flat no lighting effects
which isn't really fair right because
you can all these things with our TX you
can cheat them so to not even atleast
show like a good faith effort of here's
what we would normally do versus here's
toggle switch and boom our TX is Han
right which I feel like is what they did
also for that global illumination demo
in that green in Red Room it was just
everything off or everything
RTX yeah and yeah and when we say
everything off it's like including
everything developers would previously
do to achieve an effect as close as they
can to what our TX is showing so it's
not the most fair comparison it's not a
fair comparison it is not a fair
comparison okay so next one is control
this is another game at Nvidia showed at
their press day and has posted online so
control I mean is this how does this
compare to the metro demo does this feel
like it's a more more convincing way to
show r-tx
yeah also the metro demo didn't really
have reflections it was just trying
global illumination and a very wide
environment which and all the just as a
total side note most the developers had
fewer than two or three days to work on
these implementations I didn't know that
yeah no one knew that so there you go I
was told by one of the developers
privately and I won't say which one it
was but one of them told us that they
had the hardware for a fewer than 70
hours I guess that speaks to how quickly
can be implemented although we don't
know how many hours they worked on it it
could have been 70 times 10 artists we
don't we don't know but anyway so they
don't have a lot of time to implement
this stuff which means that who knows
how this will change in the future but
this is control so control what are we
what do we want to focus on first year
there's reflections obviously right one
thing they don't want to point out that
we briefly mentioned in battlefields 5
about how its roughness is too uniform
here they do a good job of varying the
roughness which is why it looks more
realistic even though it's just as shiny
as the car was before right yes it's
very glossy but it has but it has a lot
more texture to it
imperfect detail right Oh kisses I
thought that this is pretty interesting
there's a lot of I don't know if you can
but you can see it in this monitor
there's a lot of noise happening like
everywhere in this image yes in these
frames yeah a lot of lumber floor
there's a lot near the top which would
you rather have
with what the noise drive you crazy
while gaming that's a good question
yeah I don't know it's kind of like if
we blast the body so on our camera or
something okay this is the water noise
right here as well I've been thinking
about this I don't know since in videos
denoiser is all deep learned in AI based
it I guess it can only get better as it
learns how to properly interpolate from
its low sample counter to what it should
be in theory yeah so this one is called
project Sol this is the one Nvidia did
their cutesy dancing robot with the
music at the end and then again at GTCC
Japan and at least two other times and
it was hilarious every time as all of
the demos and jokes they make at every
event are the same ones this is project
so this one I think we see some retraced
reflections in this if I remember
correctly right yeah there's the why the
thing that that was interesting for this
one is that I think they deliberately
tried to hide their subsurface
scattering they never get too close to
the human and even when they do you can
see that there's no subsurface
scattering even though I know that it's
possible with in RTX they've had other
examples of it right but for this for
whatever reason they decided that it was
either too expensive or they had to cut
it out for some reason yeah and so
subsurface scattering if you're not
familiar you could kind of take like a
flashlight for example and just shine it
against your skin you'll see like the
red light bouncing around underneath and
so that would be an example of
subsurface scattering where the light is
entering the surface in this case the
character on the screen their hand or
ear or something like that those are
typical places for subsurface scattering
where you have really thin skin the
light can get in and bounce around and
change the color is how it was typically
it describes me and called duty has had
that for a long time so it's not that's
not new either but it's all about the
method of how you do it I guess and they
they don't do it at all here so for some
reason they made the visor completely
opaque maybe they're just trying to show
off
flexions yeah they're retracing and
they're reflections but I do feel like
that no I guess some space visors are
completely opaque like when they put on
that protection from it would it would
be more interesting though to see it
semi-transparent right I think it would
be more impressive they showed off glass
earlier right so so as a tech time it
would be more impressive if it were
semi-transparent so we're not sure why
it's it's opaque if that was a design
choice or if it was to hide capabilities
so in this scene you can see an example
of Ray traced reflections you see the
lights in the background as it reflects
off of the armor it's my question then
can you do that with traditional
graphics technology do you have to do
this with our TX you really do have to
do it with our TX be honest it's I feel
like it's something that games either
heaven like a special way of faking or
just try to avoid altogether like if if
you really want to do a scene similar to
this you could set up an environment map
with all of those lights and then use
that environment map as a texture in
your shader to say what it should be
reflecting but not actually be
reflecting the environment right and
that's a lot of manual work or you pre
render something and shove it in as a
video file - which then you might have a
cut to load or something like that so
neither way of doing this in the past
has been optimal so it looks like this
is actually something that our TX
benefits the developers with and then
coming up next there's a decent example
of global illumination with the red
light that turns on towards the end of
the elevator ride I'll be right here so
you can see that is that is that GI or
is that a reflection it's it's kind of
both yes like you could like these this
sharp reflection would just be a
reflection but the light around it would
be global global illumination coming out
from the walls okay the light is shining
on - and you that you can't see the
lights anywhere in this shot so they'd
be do it very difficult to pull off with
traditional rendering tech
as well so those are the demos that
NVIDIA has at their event and elsewhere
we talked a lot about so we criticize
decent honest stuff we showed some of
the upsides just to be fair to Nvidia
here make sure we cover all angles of
this what aspects of our TX on versus
off are the most impressive in these
demos and what what actually brings
value to the industry at this moment or
what's the most immediate value I think
the most immediate value is like what we
said earlier is to developers being able
to save time not having to manually
incorporate these lighting techniques
like Jensen said it just works it just
works except definitely not there's
definitely some work involved but it
works I suppose more readily or easily
there's not quite as much tuning like
you said for that one demo project Sol
if you wanted to get those lights to
reflect off of the character's armor
without having them in the scene that
would require it sounds like an
environment map and then you have to
screw around with that manually map it
for that specific environment so that
does not apply anywhere else in that
instance only in that environment and
doing it with ray tracing would be
significantly easier in that I guess you
could have any environment like that and
the lights should just reflect once it's
implemented so in that regard I suppose
it just works even though I hate that
phrase because it sounds like he's
trying to be like Steve Jobs a little
bit too much it's definitely where
they're going with it but the idea
remains so what's what's another upside
what's something metro it's I don't
think we were really either of us were
really impressed by Metro yeah Metro is
Metro is weird Metro is weird
there's one corner where he could CGI
working
I was very noisy it would be easier to
tell the difference if if they did flip
on and off in this demonstration but
like Patrick said earlier if you can't
tell a difference without having a
side-by-side comparison then what's even
the point
yeah yes and if they're going for the
Apple audience then everyone's just
going to be amazing
regardless like wow that does look
really good
not not wow that looks better but wow
that looks good
so yeah Metro not super impressive the
battlefield 5 demo so that will feel 5 I
guess first commentary too shiny to be
real comments that we saw on YouTube and
elsewhere that's we think not our TXS
fault that's probably just how I feel
like it's the materials fault
rather than what exs fault be dice
whoever the developers so that would be
the material which is not an RT X thing
and it might just be shinier than
necessary it's a illustrate the
difference but battlefield does have a
tendency of they have a lot of materials
in the game and a lot of them do look
bad in previous games
so especially cars and objects like that
that aren't really important and post
battlefield and I made this point a
couple a week or two ago in a video
that'll build a competitive game and I
mean I get what they're trying to do as
a high fidelity game but in reality
you're trying to kill the other players
and at some point like the the
reflections not really something I pay
attention to but it's still an okay demo
I guess they did bring up some
interesting points out if you wanted to
peek behind a corner if you want to look
at a reflection to see a player coming
up to your location then I guess that
would be an advantage competitively RT
ik and that is definitely something that
would be banned and turn on and play
unless everyone had it I guess unless
they have it in which case yeah I mean
it's that gets that's been a discussion
for a long time to like I mean I
remember the original CS 1.6 or CSS 1.6
I think had smoke grenades that were
sprites oh and if you lowered the
graphics settings enough you could start
turning off some of the density of those
sprites or something to that effect
that's cool it's been like two decades
almost but and and that was just a
graphics options debate and all that
stuff is controlled in tournament play
so right but it is a potential advantage
I guess into
Pub matching and then a GI Dan what we
didn't like so think that recaps all of
them will be talking about this a lot
more soon we might do some of our own
demos with Unreal Engine or something
like that in the future so check back
