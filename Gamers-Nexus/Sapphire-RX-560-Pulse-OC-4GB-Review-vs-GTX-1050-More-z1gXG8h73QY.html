gigabyte versions priced at around $100
and four gigabyte versions around 115
we're reviewing the Sapphire rx 560
pulse
Oh see today a 4 gigabyte variant at
$115 the gtx 1050 is the most immediate
competition and previously out ranked
the RX 460 and the majority of our tests
with similar pricing the RX 560 returns
in an attempt to change that hierarchy
continuing and these at line of polaris
refresh cards flanked by the 1050 and
1050 Ti with the rx 570 at the higher
end before that this content is brought

place to order with their online

cost $25 end up and are installed via
magnets and can be seen in some shots of
the cards reviewing that lately used
code gamers Nexus 5 for five dollars off
your order or click the link below this
review will be pretty quick and easy by
our standards anyway the 560 isn't
anything crazy new it's so Polaris
architecture just like the 580 was it's
a refresh of an existing line of and the
architecture from last year and with the
560 the main change here rather than
just going with frequency and voltage
changes like we saw the 580 over the 480
or 572 the 470 what we have here is a
fully unlocked 560 so the 460 previously
had a some locked cores that had to see
use that were unavailable to the user so
it was 14 rather than the full 16 on the
chip this one goes for the full 16 s he
used which means you're not only getting
a frequency difference depending on
which card you buy or look at but also
getting a core count difference so the
differences here in performance are more
than just frequency changes basically we
do have some chord changes as well as
for this particular card the post OC is
a $115 model which makes it one of the
sort of borderline limit cards where you
start bumping into territory where other
cards might make more sense and the
lower end to gigabyte models around $100
directly competing with the gtx 950
where previously the RS 460 was
competing this model is pretty
straightforward about half of the PCB
doesn't even really long about a third
of the PCB doesn't even really need to
be there it's basically blank and what
you end up with is a very tiny GPU die
it's one of these smallest set AMD is
shipping right now with a couple of VRAM
modules and a three-phase VRM for the
vrm and we as you can see by the
thermocouples did test thermals on the B
around the vram the vrm is using magnet
chip semiconductor fats so they're using
MDU
1514 and mvu 1517 fats they're not
amazing it's a three-phase it's pretty
basic but this isn't really an
overclocking card anyway so a pretty
basic card very cheap and it's just
targeting an ultra budget build and
we're going to test it today versus the
GTX 1050 primarily 1050 T I look at the
previous rx 460 a couple of our tests
have a bit of everything in there so you
can see the full stack up as this
compares to things like a 475 70 and up
for full testing methodology as always
check the link in the description below
that's the complete review written
review we've got 3d mark tests in there
that we won't have here but otherwise
most of stuff will be here in in
addition to the normal testing
methodology one quick note some of these
cards somewhat annoyingly have OC and
their name which means that in the
charts when we list OC it means either
it's actually overclocked by us or the
card is named OC an example would be the
MSI GTX 1050 OC card which is not really
overclocked it's one of the cheapest ten
fifties that is out there we're testing
it because it's cheap it's a hundred
dollars normally $80.00 after rebates
right now MSI just tags the letters OC
on it so we're going to put quotes
around OC if it's part of the card name
as opposed to actually overclocked just
a quick note starting off with total
power consumption as measured at the
wall our RX 5 60 pulse configurations
are 6 to 10 watts on idle with the
overclocked
Varian's mostly equal to this this is a
lower power consumption than the rx 460
for two reasons one and the tune to the
500 series of Polaris cards to draw
lower power one Idol this is really just
a BIOS update and to the RX 460 we test
it anyway has LEDs and extra hardware on
the board like another fan which
increases power draw for comparison our
MSI GTX 1050 model which MSI calls the
OC unit but we're running stock as the
equal power consumption in our test to
the rx 550 pulse moving to 3dmark
firestrike the RX 5 60 pulse faces a
total system power job 148 watts lower
than the RX 460 nitro only because the
460 hosts two fans LEDs and different
volt frequency curves otherwise as we
saw in our RS 580 versus our X 480
results which we can highlight here the
500 series has generally been drawing
more power given the same PCB in cooler
this one is a bit different though
regardless 148 watts for the pulse 4
gigabyte card jumping to 172 an
overclock the GTX 1050 configuration
draws 139 watch with the MSI card and
the 1060 SSE for reference sits at
around 219 watts total system power draw
in real world gaming workloads starting
with 4 honors the RX 5 60 pulse runs a
power consumption of around 170 to watch
total system power draw the RX 460 nitro
is at around 180 watts and both fans are
cranking in this case but 560 pulls
overclocked card the hovers around 193
watch total draw below the gtx 960 SSC
at 218 watts total system power draw the
msi 1050 card hovers at 153 watts total
system power job marking it about 11
percent reduction in power consumption
from the pulse 560 playing Ghost Recon
wildlands we observe a total system
power consumption of around 170 to watch
for the RX 560 pulse that's a reduction
about 5.7 percent from the particular rx
460 that we tested with the overclocked
pulse build to draw in 194 watts this is
about an 8% reduction from the GTX 960
SOC at the low end the 1050 MSI card
runs at 152 I've settle system power
draw moving now it's a thermal test and
we start with a simple frequency versus
time chart to plot GPU core stability
under a power bi
scenario clocks are enumerated
differently in these torture workloads
than in gaming workloads meaning the
clock is lower than in gaming of power
consumption and thermals are higher
given the low-power cooler on the
Sapphire 560 pulse we expected wears
cooling performance than what was output
in our torture workload
it seems that thanks to the relatively
low power consumption of the GPU
compared to its larger counterparts
things are kept under control relatively
even with the heatsink that is similar
to an Intel stock cooler we're looking
at an average GPIO to reading of
approximately 75 Celsius put the target
seeming to be about 73 to 75 C GPU clock
maintains just below 1200 megahertz and
we see some clock dithering at this
point ideally to observe a perfectly
straight line for the clock but our
range is still about 20 megahertz which
really isn't bad to maintain this clock
and temperature the fan ramps up
maximally to around 36% fan speed for
1600 rpm on this particular cooler the
next question is how the vrm and vram
components hold up to the small cooler
fortunately because this card isn't
driving much power the vrm is actually
do okay with our thermocouple testing we
measured one of the hottest MOSFETs at
around 63 Celsius which is well within
any reasonable operating temperature and
we're so far below the 125 C threshold
that that temperatures are completely a
non-issue here at least for the stock
card the top left the vram module is one
of the hottest vram modules on the card
and measures about 75 Celsius or still
well with inspect here that would get a
bit warm in a higher ambient environment
with restricted airflow TV is io
temperature remains steady at around 73
to 75 Celsius and we'll move on to
gaming next but for 3dmark results check
the article into the description below
starting our game testing with for honor
the Sapphire rx 560 pulse
OC operates at 43 FPS average with this
in-game test course with GM's coined 1%
low frame rate and 0.1% lows we see
thirty two point seven fps and twenty
eight foot seven fps this position sorry
560 poles below the GTX entity from MSI
which despite its name is not actually
overclocked and above the rx for 64
gigabyte card we've got a lead of about
5.7 percent over the previous RS 464
gateway card running with the slower
clock rate and fewer cores and the GT
extensively produces and a lot
point six percent lead over the RX five
six people's OC to compare versus other
nearby cards the $140 msi gtx 750ti runs
out to the seven FPS average 49 fps 1%
lism 47 FPS 0-100 in for some blows this
place is the 10 50 TI approximately 19%
ahead of the $100 GTI 1050 and 32% ahead
of the rx 560 RX 570 at $180 around 35%
faster than the GTX 1050 TI while those
cards aren't the focus of today they
help us understand if and when the extra
money could be worth while frame time
consistency isn't cane for the rx 560 in
this particular title as we can show on
the frame time plot on the screen now
although the GTX 1050 does reasonably
well when compared to the 560 moving on
to Mass Effect Andromeda we start with
higher settings past to get some
comparative numbers for the higher end
cards and we'll move on to tests with
medium settings the $115 Sapphire rs5 60
pulse runs an average FPS of 37 with
loads of 31 and 30 trailed by the rx 460
nitro 4 gigabyte card which runs 834 FPS
average the 560 weeds by about 8 point 8
percent over the 460 next card up the
msi 10 50 100 dollar card operates an
average of 46 FPS with lows tightly
times as on the previous cards the 1050
Ti runs a 51 FPS average out matched
quickly by an Rx 570 at 63 FPS average
let's look at a medium result although
more limited as we've only just begun
testing lower end GPUs
we get a better idea as to relative
performance on these cards with me
setting the GTI 1050 is able to hit 61
FPS average with the RX 560 stock
running 53 average 45 FPS 1 percent
lower than 42 0.1% lows this landed
about 6.6 percent better than the rx 460
nitro 4 Giga card with the overclocked
560 pulse running at 8.8 present faster
than the stock rx 560 moving now to doom
with Vulcan and async compute the RS 560
finally begins to pull ahead of the gtx
950 in fact once overclocked it also
pulls ahead of the more expensive 1050
Ti
this is in line with what we've seen out
of this particular game in the past or
doom tends to produce more favorable
results for AMD with its Vulcan
integration
and the msi 10:50 OC struggles a bit
maintaining an average FPS of 44 with
lows dipping to 25 and overall produces
less consistent fame times than the RX
564 q a card
the 560 a vertically took up PS which is
about 6.5 percent faster than the rx for
64 gigabyte nitro card overclock the 560
moves up to 74 FPS average which is a
13% increase over its stock performance
irreverence the rx 574 gigabyte card
averages at around 120 FPS or 60% faster
than the rx 560 postcard a quick note
here this is what doom configured to
ultra graphics at 1080p not bad
performance for these low-end devices
even a 1050 and although we wouldn't
really recommend it for this game we now
move to Ghost Recon wildlands where
we've got tests at very high for
comparison and then medium for more
realistic representations of the cards
we've got a fairly complete view of
performance from top to bottom with this
chart with regard to scaling the RX 5 60
pulse operates an average FPS of 33.3
followed by the RX 4 64 gigabyte card at
32 FPS average the GTX 1050 is able to
sustain a higher average FPS at 36 with
the 1050 TI running about 42 average for
perspective the RX 570 runs an average
FPS of 51 leading the rx 560 by 52% it's
not until the RS 5 75 80 and DK 1060
territory that we start reaching numbers
where it be possible to play on a mix of
very high and high settings the gtx 1060
is the real Victor of that stack but at
more than two times the cost of the 1050
or the 560 it can't really be considered
as an alternative in the price point
instead of trying to make that work
let's run the test with lower settings
moving down to 1080p medium hears medium
where you'd more reasonably be playing
on these $100 class cards we've got
fewer cards on this chart but enough to
start building an understanding of
performance the RX 560 pulse now runs an
average of 43 FPS about 10 FPS higher
than previously landing it around 7.5%
faster than the rx for 64 gigabyte nitro
card overclocking gets us to 46 FPS
average which is about on par with the
MSI 1050 card stock performance that was
IG tier 10 2d stock card operating point
6 percent faster than the RX 5 64
gigabyte card for reference the GTX
hunted the GI stock card runs a
the three FPS average makes it 12.8%
faster than the 1050 and 15.3% fastened
of the RX 560 sorry 570 is about 50%
faster than the RX 560 for reference and
finally we've got Sniper Elite 4 which
is another game where we've only just
started running at low end card tests so
it's not as populated as our 4k test
charts looking at 1080p high the RX 5 64
gigabyte card runs an average of 52 FPS
with the overclocking producing a 9%
performance improvement over baseline
the RX 460 runs a 49 FPS average making
the gap between the 460 and 560 about
6.7 percent the GTR 1050 is led by all
of these links to its 43 FPS average the
overclocking nearly gets its averages on
par with the 460 despite lower
performance and frame time consistency
overall as illustrated by GM's low
values these performance numbers plot
the 560 close to 1050 Ti with the RS 570
hitting 100 FPS averages at times just
for reference so it looks better than
the RS 460 did at launch with the 460
especially the 4 gigabyte pricing for
the units that we received initially it
was hard to justify the purchase first
of the 1050 because the 1050 was really
just either performed equally or better
in really all cases that we tested at a
time and it was about a $10 price
difference at worst when the 1050 was
honored $10 and that was cheaper $200
sometimes you get them with 80 if you
consider a rebate as part of the price
but these cards the 2 gigabyte models
are at $100 we're planning to do a 2 V
for test 4 gigabytes
bit more this one is 115 from what we've
been told so it's really not too bad in
the testing here today the 560 makes up
some ground where the 460 was losing
finally the rx 560 is competitive with
the GTX 1050 in about half the title be
tested and by competitive it's either a
head or tied and on the other half it's
a bit behind the 1050 still but when the
560 is ahead it's ahead by a good deal
so that's the real difference here with
Dumon Sniper Elite 4 being the main
titles here the seminal examples of low
level API is being done correctly the RX
560 takes the lead with the DX 11 titles
we tested the gtx 950 takes the lead or
is pretty close to it anyway so what you
need to do for these cards is look at
the type of games you're playing figure
out what API they're on apparently and
from there you should be able to figure
out which one's worth the buy more
realistically what you do is you look at
the price and you see if there's more
than a fifteen dollar difference between
them at which point it's time to just
take based on price for the most part
because they're not hugely different in
performance once you get above $120 for
any of these cards ten 55 60 or whatever
they start quickly losing value the 1050
TI is still in that really weird
position it was when we first reviewed
it where it's an okay performer but it
sits between really strong performers at
the low end which would now be the five
six pm at ten fifty and pretty good
performance at the mid-range which would
be VR x4 70 or now the five seventy with
of course ten sixties and 40s after that
so the ten fifty TI is still in a weird
spot it's worth buying for those really
specific use cases where you have one
hundred forty dollars and you can't
possibly budget an extra twenty to
thirty for a better card like the five
seventy at this point or you just you
have ten more dollars then you can spend
on something like a five sixty or ten
fifty that's the only time the tentative
DGI makes sense it's always been a
weirdly positioned card as for the low
end though ten visi still does really
well it is getting older at this point
by standards in the GPU market so that
means it's harder to recommend the five
sixteen does just fine it's not terrible
it's not impressive it's just fine so
these are not the most exciting cards to
look for reviews for but if you are
buying them hopefully this helps you
make a decision we've got the numbers
