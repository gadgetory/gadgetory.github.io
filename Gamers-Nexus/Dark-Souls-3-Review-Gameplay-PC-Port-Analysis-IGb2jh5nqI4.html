challenge and abuse that games of your
put us through there was this
ever-present concept that the core
experience was sort of a reward mechanic
fulfilled by player gratification
yielded from self-improvement an
acquired skill rather than items given
to you throughout the course of the game
and information conveyance helped with
obstacles and level navigation for lack
of high resolution details and finer
object placement like we have in today's
games and those games were hard to it's
definitely something that feels like
it's gone away where the games have
gotten easier with time but a lot of
that is really a byproduct a difficulty
of older games as a byproduct of an era
with significant technological
limitations mostly a lack of storage
capacity on things like cartridges where
you couldn't fit savegame files and a
few modern games resurrects the design
psychology of challenge reward
progression as experienced with those
older titles but some of them have
definitely made a bit of return if we
look at games like Super Meat Boy on the
platformer side that certainly was one
of the hardest games made in recent
years on the RPG side it's been dark
souls which has established itself as
one of the most prolific titles of its
ilk in recent years and it's been taken
down a few notches
only by shaky PC port history but other
than that gameplay itself has been
generally good and in today's review of
Dark Souls 3 we'll be talking about PC
controls first gameplay mechanics and
replayability we're starting with those
PC controls and the state of the port
which as a full disclaimer is the most
negative aspect of this review because
the rest of the game is pretty good and
so the tone is generally positive but PC
compatibility and the controls of Dark
Souls have been a systemic issue for the
last few games and it remains the case
with Dark Souls 3 the first game of the
series never made it to PC and the
second was rushed to the PC platform by
the publishers something that from
software themselves explained when
noting that Namco Bandai cared less
about figuring out how to make the game
work and more about just getting it out
the door and observing the market
consumption on the PC side Dark Souls 3
was poised to improve but still shipped
with a number of issues default input is
completely utterly nonsensical and our
first greeting upon booting the
game is a giant legal disclaimer screen
that requires an accepted declined
button press and that's kind of okay but
the accept and decline buttons are
unclick Abul until you scroll through
the entire legal document and the best
part is the scroll wheel doesn't work
and neither does the scroll bar or the
scroll arrow is on the screen and the
only way to get through it is with the
arrow keys or just a little bit of
infuriating because someone with
frontpage could have made a better
scroll bar than what was made in Dark
Souls 3 so we're forced to hold down the
arrow key which eventually unlocks the
accept button and that's sort of the
first puzzle in the game is figuring out
how to scroll down we're then met with
the splash screen that says press any
key to continue and well it's really not
any key because enter doesn't work
escape doesn't work and literally any
other key on the keyboard does not work
so there's no way to get through this
without just clicking on the text that
says press any key and then you get to
the next puzzle of navigating the game
menus and settings again enter an escape
do nothing it's actually e and q to
navigate the menus by default cube e and
what's naturally of course escape for a
menu in the eyes of the developers from
software and that's before talking about
framerate which is again locked to 60fps
like the previous title which was fixed
only through hacks made by users that's
a major issue for owners of high refresh
rate displays and vsync is not present
or toggleable in the menu system and
trying to force it off through the
Nvidia control panel and these control
panels just simply doesn't work it seems
as if the framerate is tied to the
engine timing as we've seen in games
like fallout 4 and it'll research this
more for a future peace but for now all
this said we just were stuck to 60fps
for the playthrough we also had some
issues with game pads and keyboard input
but these were resolved with a day one
patch or actually a pre day one patch
and it's clear that the team is at least
trying to make these different input
devices work properly with Dark Souls 3
but enough of the controls bash and
that's easy to do with Dark Souls and it
always has been let's look at the
gameplay itself Dark Souls drops us into
a game world that's secondary to the
mechanics but still well designed and
important to overall cohesion of
delivery the world is ending and thrown
into chaos and we've been resurrected as
a quantity or equality solution to that
problem Dark Souls 3 is what we
all an offline multiplayer game and it
doesn't really try to hide the fact that
there's really no heroes here only
thousands of actors within its landscape
death is common and is accommodated for
in the design mechanics and notes left
behind by dying characters ie other
players in the offline online fusion
make this pretty clear monster ahead for
example is something that someone might
write on one of the notes and that would
be followed by a timely discovery of
murderous aberrations it's all just
background to the gameplay focus though
and gameplay in Dark Souls 3 is more
complex than the average pedestrian hack
and slash game combat is comprised of
dodging timing and attack speed all of
which rapidly outpace character
development in terms of battle advocacy
and the importance of just being good
rather than having a good character the
game takes a skill based approach to
progression and uses player betterment
as the primary reward mechanic still
Dark Souls 3 has deeper role-playing
elements than just battle mechanics and
this is one shown by classes in Dark
Souls 3 which are basically a construct
of stat point assignment meaning that
classes are entirely just characters of
points pre assigned for different
equipment advantages and layouts and
proficiencies characters start around
level eight to ten giving the players
some established style and a fighting
chance but hardcore players can start at
level one and build from the ground up
if they so choose a skilled player can
do a lot with a low-level character and
its really all about navigation of the
battlefield so there's less reliance and
fallback on the raw power level of the
player character the souls games have
always had this focus on gameplay
characters and story work as supporting
casts to the mechanical star of the show
combat is technical it's about the
details and there's no allowance to get
lazy in any combat event even against a
mob tier foes timing of blocks and
attacks is paramount in preserving the
scarcest resource in Dark Souls and that
is character Health Dark Souls has never
handed out checkpoints and they don't do
it in the newest game either a death can
set progress back measurably which means
that this type of game is one that's not
easily exploited deciding to charge
fourth and Explorer on the contingency
that you can just load it for example it
doesn't really translate into dark souls
and will get punished pretty
fiercely you can set you back a good
amount of time in real world time
sometimes this means that combat can
feel tedious or means that a death
causes you to turn the game off for the
evening just because it's been taken too
long to get past something but the
reward is getting better at the game
learning the animations and telegraphed
attacks of enemies and it's worth the
investment if you like that type of game
Dark Souls 3 is a very personal game in
this regard and it's all about giving
the player a distinct feeling of
advancement in progress and learning
rather than items and all this is to say
that while everything in the game serves
the gameplay there is still somewhat of
a plot so the plot isn't really
something that you're there for it
certainly exists it's in the background
you've been returned to life or on life
as it were to save the dying planet and
the game never really pedals this beyond
that sort of basic foundation as players
story advancement was never our
motivation to take the controls getting
better was and that's pretty unique
levels are semi linear and that's clear
in the end point of the levels but
designs sometimes create sprawled side
paths that build upon the atmosphere
information conveyance is used adeptly -
this direct players in the right
direction and that allows for these side
paths to exist without imposing a
feeling of being lost or overwhelmed
this sometimes happened with dungeon
games Dark Souls 3 is seriously worth to
pick up if you're able to tolerate the
summer awkwardly ported nature of the
game it's challenging and the challenge
is intensely rewarding in terms of
personal gratification from skill
advancement and if you want to read more
