and today we're talking about Kingdom
Kingdom is a 2013 flash game originally
developed by Noah but expanded upon and
brought to PC in cooperation with fellow
developer licorice and the game is being
published by Rob URI this is the
company's first published title Kingdom
is a two-dimensional side-scrolling
kingdom building and expansion game with
inspiration taken from capitalism of
course and in the game we take charge as
a king or queen of a soon to be built
kingdom within the two-dimensional
randomly generated landscape which does
have bounding boxes effectively on the
sides there is a limit to how large
landscape is and in the game our set of
actions is fairly minimal it is
definitely a minimalist inspired game
your actions include movement left to
right sprinting on your horse and
throw-in money around and that's the key
thing really the whole game revolves
around this concept of using money to
compel peasants archers what have you to
complete the various somewhat limited
tasks in the game but that minimalist
approach doesn't doesn't mean a bad
thing it does not take away from the
design in fact it adds to it and that's
sort of where Kingdom gets its charm
Kingdom sort of reminds us of Majesty in
one key aspect and it's important to
note that Majesty and Kingdom are
nothing at all alike but the game
Majesty uses in direct input to control
NPCs within the game so this is not a
game where you can micromanage your
followers your peasants your Knights you
use indirect input through the form of
coins to compel your soon-to-be
followers to do different tasks so you
can turn them into builders by giving
them hammers which you buy at a shop
with your coin that hammer is dropped on
the ground someone picks it up they then
go on to build towers walls castles and
other things like that economy
generating buildings like farms all of
these things cost coin and in the case
of the economy building
generate coin so it is very important to
build a strong economy early on and then
use that money generated to expand your
kingdom in the form of walls knights and
archers to help defend the kingdom
against assault assault happens every
night by sort of lovecraftian style
Horrors they're not really zombies but
they're they're weird things they live
in the woods they have masks and they
chase you very quickly and if they catch
you if you're not within the walls of
your kingdom safely if you don't have
your archers and knights defending you
then these creatures will seize your
crown at which point you've either got
to retrieve it very quickly or you lose
and this is a permadeath game so should
you lose your crown and fail to retrieve
it immediately then that's it game over
you've got to start a new Kingdom as a
new king or queen from scratch from a
new randomly generated map Kingdom is
exceedingly easy to pick up and play
because of its minimalistic place I'll
but there is actually a decent level of
depth to it and that feeds from its
addictive charm as what was once a flash
game there's very little in the way of
tutorial other than the first couple
seconds of the game and this is all
overall a good thing but at times the
minimalism can get a bit frustrating
especially when it comes to the lack of
micromanagement which is a core design
choice and does work out to be pretty
good in the long run but as a new player
it is a frustrating design choice
because sometimes it's you're watching
your archers walk around on the wrong
side of the village contributing nothing
to their dying hordes of friends who are
being mowed down by hell spawn on the
opposite side of the village and there's
also no way to cancel orders so should
you decide that building an extra wall
where you chose to build one is no
longer a good choice because night is
falling there's no way to stop that from
happening this does feed into the game
strategy a little bit and that's why we
think that the game is making good on
its choice of minimalism but you have to
get past that initial barrier of
frustration to fully enjoy it the game
is ten
it's a true indie title at true indie
price and everything you see in the
trailer everything you see in this
gameplay footage over the voice-over is
basically all you get there's not much
more to it you wander side to side you
build stuff you try to survive as long
as possible and eventually you probably
die and then start over now there is
technically a wind condition in the game
Patrick who wrote the review put in
about 30 hours of gameplay and never got
to that wind condition so either he's
terrible at it what she actually seems
to be pretty good or it's actually kind
of hard to get to so there's a wooden
condition you're mostly going to be
dying permadeath style and then just
repeating until you get a good process
going and you can develop a strategy for
progressing on the game that is kingdom
overall we like the game we found that
it was worth the ten dollars in price
and you can read the full review links
in the description below or Patrick
lengthen talks in a great depth about
how the game plays through its gameplay
mechanics and what type of player should
be buying the game there are a few small
caveats and they are mostly rooted in
the core design of the game which means
that either you get used to them and
grow to like them or you will never get
used to them and you can't stand it and
those caveats as discussed are primarily
to do with the lack of micromanagement
so it's either good or really annoying
and that is up to you to decide it is
worth looking into for sure though if
you want a quick pick up and play game
that has some level of depth to it and
will give you more than your ten dollars
worth in terms of hours that's all for
