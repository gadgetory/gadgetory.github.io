that's this thing this is the
introduction of Polaris at 10 the new
GPU architecture from Andy it's
available on two models four gigabytes
for $200 and eight gigabytes for $240
and the card is being accompanied by the
RX 470 and 460 available respectively
mid-july for the 470 and end of July for
the 460 that's the other important news
revealed today for today we're reviewing
the RX 488 gigabyte card and before
getting to this review all of this
coverage is brought to you by Origin PC
and their new origin a Kronos small
form-factor PC which is customizable
upgradable and now shipping with the RX
484 high end that home theater and vr
gaming back to the content the RX 4 80
has 36c use and 2304 stream processors
it operates at a boosted clock rate of
12 is 66 megahertz and the 8 gigabyte
model cards use 8 gigabits per second v
round that's gddr5 while the 4 gigabyte
cards operate at 7 gigabits per second
the table on the screen also shows the
RX 470 and RX 460 specs or what we know
of them now anyway or have extrapolated
and a lot of architecture changes have
been made to Polaris 10 the new GPU
architecture and that includes a
doubling of l2 cache size and the
introduction of a heuristic circuit
which is used to prefetch instructions
and reduce sort of wasted time on
underutilized cycles Andy has also
updated its geometry processors which
now perform additional primitives
calling to remove geometry from the
pipeline that won't visually impact the
scene this is especially useful where
AMD might be dealing with tessellation
tasks this is done with a primitive
discard accelerator which looks for
orphaned primitives basically that's not
really exactly but they look for
primitives that don't have sample points
and it's different from the usual Z
calling which all Z calling does is it
looks at a scene and if it if I've got
this card in front of me the Z calling
process will look behind the card say ok
we're not seeing any geometry right here
it's obscured by the card so we're not
going to draw the geometry this is
different from that this is
specifically calling unneeded triangles
primitives that would tessellate scenes
in ways that might not be perceptible to
the user now the block diagram that
you've seen drills down into ACU that
looks pretty much the same as what we're
used to so there are four texture filter
units per Cu or compute unit and we end
up with 144 TMU is on the arcs 480
there's also a CES you have a couple of
those four of those for the RX 480
this architecture has some pretty
similar terminology to previous
architectures but it's been updated in a
lot of ways and if you're curious to
learn more about architecture
specifically for Polaris 10 hit the link
in the description below where we've got
the fold pretty big written review and
we go into full depth on that now as a
quick aside there's also Polaris 11
which is different from 10 it's a lower
TDP chip it operates closer to 2
teraflops rather than 5 teraflops and
Polaris 11 is meant more for laptops and
low-end DGP use like the rx 460 and will
be utilized in those low power
consumption cases that really only want
to focus on getting as much performance
as possible out of something that's more
similar to low-end chip power draw let's
get into the thermal benchmarks first so
these thermal charts show the
temperature of the RX 4 80 subtracting
out ambient that's delta T over a mate's
you can read more about how that works
in the article links in the description
below which also contains some new
endurance charts and one of those that
will be showing you here includes the
fan rpm versus frequency versus
temperature but we have some more in the
article linked below so let's just dive
into this straight away this first chart
shows peak average GPU temperatures that
the number is averaged at the same point
in the over time a graph for every card
so we wait until the temperature
asymptotes and stabilizes before
averaging the output for an equilibrium
value the MDR x 480 runs about as warm
as the gtx 10a TF e and and these are X
480 cooler lands the chip at 50 6.33
delta T over ambient and that Celsius of
course went under load when idle we're
seeing temperatures of 7.58 Celsius and
the reference GTX 1084 comparison
runs at 57 point 5 1 Celsius
load and 7.9 6 Celsius Idol both are
handily beaten by a IV partner coolers
which we won't see for a few weeks for
the RX 4 80 but that's sort of how the
industry usually works anyway like the
GTX 1080 and 1070 the and ER x 480 seems
to peak around 80 to 82 Celsius absolute
when under the stock auto settings and
we'll look at fan rpm versus temperature
in a moment along with throttle checks
but first we're looking at the thermals
overtime chart and this chart possesses
the same data as in the chart we just
looked at for peak average thermals but
represents it against the entire test
period the RX 480 is represented in
bright yellow the GN hybrid 1080 our DIY
project is the lowest temperature on the
chart and the dark blue line colliding
with the 480 is the GTX 1080 EFI card
and now here's the first endurance chart
this one shows frequency versus
temperatures with a tighter zoom on the
frequency left axis as the card hits its
peak stock temperature of about 82
Celsius just like we saw with the GTX
1080
the frequency occasionally throttles
back to lower temperatures and the range
of frequency fluctuation is a little
less than 100 megahertz maximally on the
RX 480 and even that higher 90 to 100
megahertz range is very uncommon for the
most part this does not manifest itself
in perceptible FPS changes it's not
really chaotic enough to cause any
serious issues like we've seen with some
overclocking stability tests and it's a
big enough change to see a very brief
hit 20.1% low frame times but they're
infrequent enough that it's pretty easy
to overlook this is similar to our
conclusion with the GTX 1080s f:e cooler
at its stock clock this next chart
includes the fan rpm in order to sustain
its stock out of box max temperature
target of about 80 Celsius the our X 480
fan spins between 1800 and 2200 rpm on
average the frequency line is relatively
stable as shown at the bottom of this
chart and if you're curious to learn
more about these tests hit that link in
the description below now the next
obvious question is how much noise does
that 1802 2200 fan rpm range make for
the actual user sitting next to the
system and we've got some numbers for
you here for that the decibel testing
out first
this decimal test is a total system
noise chart so it's not just the noise
that this thing makes we've got a noise
floor of the power supply and the CLC
pump as well to include in there and
also we have some subjective comparisons
of the volume that this this fan outputs
coming up in a video about an hour after
this videos publication you'll find that
on the channel if you want to hear what
this sounds like at 50% hundreds on
tidal and auto and so forth and these
fan spins at just 780 rpm went under
no-load keeping the card in these seven
to eight Celsius delta T range while
maintaining the 37.3 decibel noise
output the auto fan speed finds its
resting point in the 2000 to 2,300 rpm
range and produces a total system noise
of thirty nine point four DB not a huge
gain over a thirty seven ish DB noise
floor we hit forty two point eight
decibels at 50% fan speeds overtaking
the 1080 and ten seventy F E which have
a 41 point 9 DB output and this is
because the Andy fan is now spinning
faster since it has a faster rpm total
at 5200 maximally 100% fan speed is
utterly unbearable at this point the
rest of the system noise becomes
basically irrelevant because it's all
drowned out by the GP blower fan and
realistically you'd never want to
approach this fan speed anyway you can
hear this hen speed in comparison to
normal speech and 50% fan speed in our
video that's posted after this one but
it is pretty loud at the 60 to 65
decibel range depending on what you've
got going on in the system alright so
enough of the non FPS content now we're
gonna move on to frames per second and
frame times for all the standard games
we test with a couple things here first
of all we have power consumption tests
on the website in the review hit the
link for power consumption analysis and
then we've also got more games tested
then we're going to be showing here and
that's also on the website including
Mirror's Edge and a couple of other cool
games that we use for our normal
analysis of these video cards doom is up
first this is an OpenGL game and at
Forte doom is unsurprisingly not
playable on the RX 480
but it's still worth testing to see the
performance at baselines the R X 480
outputs 29.7 fps at 4k ultra in Doom
with the 390x operating 4 to 5 fps
averages at 1440p the RX 40 runs at 50
6.3 FPS average with tightly timed 43
and 42 FPS 1% and 0.1% lows the RX 480
is 23.6% faster than the gtx 960 for
gigabyte card and 33% faster than the r9
380 x the r9 390x is 10.1 percent faster
than the RX 480 and the gtx 970 is 17%
faster than the RX 480 and videos at new
gtx 1070 runs approximately 43% faster
than the RX 480 which is pretty massive
but it's also twice the price at 1080p
the RX 4 80 lands between the 390x at 89
fps and the gtx 960 at 67.7 FBS with the
RX 480 at 80 4.7 FPS the GTX 970 runs at
101 fps so that's a speed increase of
16.1% over the 480 and is consistent
with the 1440 tests moving on to shadow
of mordor at 4k the RX 480 is
effectively equivalent to the GTX 970
and the r9 390x is approximately 27%
faster than the 480 which is the same
for the 1070 it's about the same average
FPS output as the 390 X and is therefore
also about 27% faster and it's averages
at 1440p the our X 480 has a 58 FPS
average 35.7 fps 1% low and 31.7 FPS
0.1% low the r9 390x is approximately
fourteen point seven percent faster than
the 480 at 1440p average FPS values GTA
5 is having some severe stuttering
issues occurring on the our X 480 right
now and the average 3 past results don't
really tell the full story so we're
gonna be showing some raw FPS data from
our tests after each chart to help
illustrate just what the problem is
here's the normal 1080p chart the RX 40
operates at 83 FPS average for this test
but it's 0.1% low metric takes a serious
dive in one of the test passes that
we'll show in a second the average frame
a technically exceeds the 390x at 7.6
percent faster and 380 X at twenty point
five percent faster and is seven percent
behind the 970 so we're behind the 970
in this test the playability on the and
the RX 480 is hindered by these stutters
and framedrops and this is part of why
the 970 is a significantly more stable
card for GTA 5 at this time here's a
look at the three different test sets
for this data the first set is 1080p and
shows that GTA 5 takes a dive in the
third test pass and as we conducted this
more it was pretty much the same story
this stuttering occurs most frequently
during lighting changes and time lapses
sunset sunrise things like that at 1440p
the RX 40 manages to hold strong at
60fps average but thanks again to a low
0.1% value 5 or 6 fps and 4k is just as
bad but it's really not meant to be
played on the RX 480 to begin with these
stutters are noticeably jarring during
gameplay but we talked to Andy's at
scott watson about this issue and we're
expecting a resolution sometime soon
call of duty black ops 3 has
historically shown a little bit of
advantage towards Andy which is okay
because it's one of the best optimized
games we have on our bench right now and
it helps to balance out some of the
results since we have other games like
Mordor where there's a swinging 4 and
video so it really just depends on what
game you're playing and what video card
you're using the kind of frame rate
you're gonna get at 4k the our X 480
runs 41 FPS average and sits below the
60 FPS mark for this FPS output so the
card is outperforming the 970 but that's
kind of a moot point
because the general unplayable nature of
both the 970 and the RX 480 make it such
that you'd never plan on 4k anyway
moving to 1440p the our X 480 isn't now
operating that 83.3 FPS average with
tightly time to 1% and 0.1% lows which
remain above the 60 FPS threshold and
that certainly deserves praise
this makes the arcs 480 at 14 point 7 7%
faster than the GTX 970 so the to do
trade blows here in this game and that
does help to nearly tie the 480 with the
980 but again if you look at other games
it goes the other way so it really just
depends on what you're planning to play
with the 480 970 what have you the r9
390x outperforms all these cards with
its 94.3 FPS average and the gtx 1070 fe
106.7 FPS which is 28% faster than the
RX 480
well put up 1080p briefly and highlight
the RX 480 so you can see the
performance but the stack is more or
less the same and the RX for 80 could
probably hit 144 FPS with some settings
reductions if you're ok with that if you
have a 144 Hertz monitor or something
like that but it is exceeding the 120
Hertz range and that's also worth no
ashes of singularity is just here for a
quick show of dx11 to dx12 scaling on
the new polaris architecture at 1080p
high we see that the RX 480 is similarly
poor-performing in the x11 as its other
and the predecessors but it benefits
architectural eon dx12 this brings the
our X 480 closer to parity with the GTX
980 similar to the black ops test we
just looked at but now with a DX 12 spin
to it 4k on high it shows similar
results with the R X 480 between the 390
X and GTX 980 and the GTX 970 is just
below 30fps
more interesting though is this frame x
chart so this is not an FPS value chart
this one shows frame times in
milliseconds at 1080p high and we're
looking at the average milliseconds
between frames on the x-axis the our X
480 sees a massive improvement in DX 12
over DX 11 though is still about even
with the GTX 970 in its average frame
pacing this is a trend for Andy's
architecture as made obvious by this
chart and is further illustrated through
our percent change graph on the screen
now the rx 480 and Polaris 10
architecture benefit nearly 77 percent
from dx11 to the X 12 and this is
similar to what's seen on last
generations r9 390x the fury X looks a
bit exaggerated here but that's just
mostly because the x11 performance is so
plainly dismal that any gain will look
massive overclocking on the RX 4 ID has
improved it massively over previous
generations of Andy's software so
previously you've been able to overclock
through things like afterburner pretty
well but Andy's in-house software was
called overdrive and that's dead now
it's gone and has been replaced with a
tool called wot man
wot man allows management of
core clock memory clock beat core memory
voltage power target and fan speed so
it's respectively powerful for OC softer
made by a GP vendor and it works well
for the most part the only trouble we
had was that was when the driver crashed
from an unstable overclock which is
really not something to be that upset
about I do wish that the software would
recover from a driver crash but we dealt
with it for now just by restarting or
logging out here's our stepping table
that shows that the RX forties
overclocked progression we ultimately
drove voltage up to around one point one
to five volts power target up to 150%
and manually configure the fan speeds to
between thirty eight hundred and forty
three hundred rpm to dissipate all that
heat the resulting frequency was a
stable thirteen forty megahertz for the
core and we bring that in for two hours
successfully and then we have a 2200
megahertz memory clock and that means
we've offset memory by 200 Hertz and
we've offset the core clock by about 74
megahertz or so here's a look at the
clock rate stability chart for that
burnin test if you're curious this shows
our OC benchmarked at 1440p and Metro
last light for a few hours and it's
similar to previous and the over clocks
in that the core frequency is already so
close to its limit that additional OC
Headroom is pretty small right now as
for fps these charts show some
performance gains for the overclock
except for in Clarke sensitive games
like shadow of mordor we generally see
an increase of a couple of frames for
the games within the range of 3 to 6 FPS
and that creates a 4.8 percent gain in
Doom depend on resolution at 7 percent
in GTA and 8 percent in Mordor and then
there's a 9 to 10 percent gain and
Mirror's Edge catalyst the rx 480 is an
interesting card it is sort of treated
like a flagship product and that it's
the first of a new architecture Polaris
10 but it's not the high-end and it's
not at a high-end price and to this end
the rx 480 is pretty much the start in
the end of Polaris the Polaris 10 chip
will be in 480 there will be the rx 470
the rx 460 will have Polaris as well but
there won't be a big Polaris chip there
will be no sort of top high-end RX 4 90
or something running Polaris if such a
thing were to exist that will be saved
for the next architecture which is Vega
Andy has invested heavily into the
performance per watt argument with
Polaris and that is evident in the move
to 14 nanometer FinFET from 28 nanometer
planar process previously with the last
generation and the RX for 80 as a $240
card trades blows with the GTX 970
Nvidia's last generation card and the
970 can now be had probably at about 250
to 280 dollar price ranges depending on
what Mir is and things like that you
apply so if you've already got a GTX 970
the RX 480 is an upgrade but if you're
considering buying a fire-sale 970 EG at
$250 over a 480 we'd actually push you
towards the RX for 80 right now the AMD
card has 8 gigabytes of vram and in the
past that's been a marketing thing that
hasn't really mattered that much but the
game is changing and these games were
benchmarking today especially at higher
resolutions like 1440p which this is
geared toward the vram does actually
matter that's why you see cards like the
fury X sometimes falling off charts in
0.1 percent lo metrics where they
otherwise should be fine the rx 480
performs pretty well at 1440p you won't
be playing 1440p at absolute max
settings that's not what this card is
for but you will be able to play it
fairly reasonably towards the 60 FPS
range if you're willing to drop down too
high from say ultra and you're kind of
average game the RX 480 is not really an
exciting architecture it's not bombastic
it's not this new top-end flagship and
in that way it's it's sort of it's a
card that accomplishes its objectives
well but those objectives are already
being accomplished by things on the
market that's not to say that it's less
valuable because the RX 480
does bring down the price point for
things that can play 1440p and it's
forests of course the 970 down in its
own price point and the RX for 80
actually is now our go-to recommendation
for these 200 ish dollar graphics cards
that Nvidia does not have something out
today that I would recommend over this
except for in very specific cases where
you might want CUDA or you might want
shadow play the 970 is still a very good
card if you have one don't sell it and
buy this there's
no reason for you to do that if you're
trying to buy a new card today and you
don't want a 1070 because it's too
expensive the two main options I would
provide to you are one if 1440p is not
something you care about or you don't
care about high frequency 1080p gaming
then you can look below this card and
probably buy something the 150 range and
be okay depending on what you want to
the second option is if you are willing
to wait the gtx 1060 will eventually
exist and in such an instance it would
be worth comparing the two so there are
X 480 overall is an improvement over
existing product offerings especially at
1440p gaming I do generally recommend it
but I'm going to make one contingency on
that recommendation it's the same that
we did for the gz x 1080 and 1070 and
that is not to buy the reference card
unless you really want it for some
reason maybe you want a blower fan for a
small form-factor case it makes sense in
those instances sometimes but if you're
building a normal Tower we'll call it I
would still recommend waiting for the
AIB partner cards those will not be out
for a few weeks most likely but a IB
partner cards always almost always cool
better and that should really be the
case for this thing the thermals are
acceptable but they are not good and the
thermals will be pretty good under
something like a dual FEM setup or a
larger copper heat sink or a low heat
sink and that is something that is
important to consider so I would wait
for those now that's not to say that
those cards will be priced the same as
this that's the big question I have and
I don't have an answer to is what price
will the AIB partner cards that land at
and if it's above 240 then maybe this is
actually the way to go but if it is at
240 then I think that's probably what
I'd be looking at for a card of this
specific GPU so I have some plans for
the RX 480
yet we'll get there and other than that
