access dotnet and i'm joined by chris
Roberts from cloud imperium games hey
everyone how you do it and today we're
talking about the FPS module so we we
spoke about a few times now have gone in
depth a bit and I think the initial
launch window was a couple months back I
saw your letter from the chairman you
cited technical and gameplay issues so
one is sort of the networking aspect of
it and you know various kind of player
like issues that were sort of dealing
with because if the FPS were trying to
have 16 verses 16 to 32 so it's a lot
more than we have in the arena commander
which right until now is only I think
being a 84 vs for the new version 1.1 5
which we're going to put on the PTU at
the end of this week will actually be 16
players now a v8 so we've actually made
some pretty good strides and fixing
stuff but we've you know the the FPS is
always plan to have more I mean
basically the issue is the spaceships
are so complicated they have so many
different moving parts that are much
heavier in network traffic and say an
individual person running around so
that's why you know we can have more on
the the FPS i but we're still having
some sort of network backend and sync
issues although I think we're in the
we're doing pretty good and ironing
amount and then the other aspect is just
the the animation and the smoothness and
the responsiveness of the animation so
we're trying to do something with
stammering there's a little different
than you normally do with most
first-person shooters because most post
person shooters really keep you in first
person and then if you're fighting you
know a lot of times you're fighting a I
so they're not the players they do their
own different animations and if you
notice in a lot of first-person shooters
that do multiplayer the fluidity of the
animation of the other players is not
actually as good as well the AI players
are and that's partly because first
person for most games is kind of
achieved the cameras base is you know
like the arms are right in front of the
eyes here and the guns there and but
because because that like with star
citizen it's different
normal FPS because you it's essentially
a whole world simulation so it's not
just running around with a gun it's
interacting with stuff it's you know
flying around and shit and it's also
doing with other people cooperatively so
if you're sitting in your consolation
you look over to the person sitting next
to you and he's in the controls you need
to see him that he's in the controls and
so some cheats that you can do in the
first person game where like it's all
different I think you know people have
all seen like they've had like what
crisis really looks like if you get
outside the first person view and you
see the guys all stretch it covers all
faked and stuff so we made a conscious
decision very early to do it correctly
so we don't unify I mean we don't we
don't separate between first and second
it's all unified it's essentially the
third the proper animations the third
person animations drive the first person
so when we are looking around in first
person that is actually where your eyes
are looking where you see your hands
that's actually where your hands really
are if you look down and see your legs
that's where your legs really are and so
it makes things harder because you can't
cheat in a lot of different ways and and
then you and we also want sort of a
fluidity of motion so like a lot of
light games would be like you go
straight left and strafe right and you
stop you instantly stop where you know
we want to have this kind of sense of
like what has you really do if you're
moving you kind of it used to be our
foot stuff so it's like you don't
instantly stop you just have a bit of a
nourishment come back if you were
sprinting really fast you're not going
to stop on a dime you'll probably have a
bit of an ocean come back so there's a
lot of sort of transitions that we've
been working on that we call Jukes which
means going this way and I drew back
it's sort of like did this on the FPS f
but so if I got the gun and I'm going
like this it's like back so my feet
stepping back over each other and you
don't normally have that level of
fidelity in the first because you don't
need it the first ones you just move it
back and forth and it's all pretty
procedural but we've we've been working
it so like in third person view
Washington character you'll see this
fluidity and you'll see it for other
people the downside of that is that
there's a certain amount of like
responsiveness
that that effect because obviously we're
cheating in first person and you go to
go right immediately you can start going
right whereas with us we've got to make
sure the Fox in the right place and the
animation starts playing backwards and
there's lots of bridge and transition
animations to do that and those
animations getting all that working
fluidly getting that to be as responsive
as part as possible and fighting you
know general things inside the animation
system CryEngine which is a really
powerful animation system but is pretty
complicated have just been sort of
taking a fair amount of time for us and
it's mainly because we're trying to do
it at a fidelity that you haven't really
seen before and blend the sort of you
know unify first and third person so
we're pretty you know we've made you
know when I did the update you know I
didn't give a day because well we didn't
we did an update in May which we didn't
hit hi there and when we showed it pax
east we said we hoped it was going to be
out sometime towards the end of April
but don't hold me to it was actually
what I said because nobody bets before I
quoted that and and so you know i think
uh you know everyone's being fairly and
we do the update in May and now you know
obviously people have been waiting a
long time for it we are mean there's a
large amount of the you know company
especially now is helping working on it
like all the animators are really
working on it and we've got some extra
help from the German studio which is a
bunch of CryEngine experts that we you
know joined us recently to to get it out
so we're trying to get it out as quick
as possible ever build up my machine
over here of both the FPS and what we're
doing for games car so I'm actually in
there doing helping out with some of the
coding stuff but we didn't want to give
a date because well you know sort of
don't get burned by that because if we
promised a day when they say no more
gether so but for some reason this last
round everybody someone said it's been
delayed indefinitely the next thing you
know people are saying oh was it
canceled that no it's not council then
and you know in reality would probably
know weeks off so we're shooting to try
and have
FPS on the PTU roundabout games carnal
slightly after the games gone and based
on where we are I think we're kind of
close to there there's just some polish
stuff so whether it's plus or minus a
week there but you know we're really
talking about people getting to play
around with FPS in you know a matter of
three four maybe five weeks we're not
talking to this cancelled that it's
delayed definitely or any of the other
stuff and and really you know the other
thing is it's about trying to make it as
you know we want people to play it and
give us feedback because that helps make
the game better arena commander to be
made better by people playing giving
feedback and that's an ongoing process
that is part of our goal but there's
always a point where there's no point in
sharing it until you think internally
that it's got enough of the base bits
working that the feedbacks going to be
useful right so if you've still got bugs
or glitches in the movement going left
to right and it's kind of annoying when
you're playing it's just going to be
annoying experience to play so those are
can it so so just because we're open
development doesn't mean that as soon as
one programmer get something up and
running that we instantly share it
because we sort of need to go through
make sure a whole bunch of different
things work and then we go yeah what
this is in now this is in a state that
we want to have a larger feedback and we
do that internally anyway like we don't
share our stuff with QA right away like
the song working on the game system
works on it for a bit i think this has
been the fucking let's have QA test
there and then really we have the next
level is ok let's have the backers give
us some more feedback so once QA has
gone through and got rid of we've banged
out a bunch of the more annoying bugs
and glitches and we think the experience
is still going to have bugs it's still
going to need feedback it's probably not
me balance right but it's not really
annoying right then we when we share of
it and that's kind of just the process
and I think unfortunately the you know
you know the delays and the aspect of
having to wait for that for everybody
backers or even us internally it's it's
it's sort of the nature of having such a
kind of open raw development process
because we don't we don't have any
buffer we basically sort of tell people
where we're at you can read our monthly
report
Watson you can see you know everybody
reports on exactly what they're doing we
get more detail than I ever gave when I
was working you know an origin or EA are
you know working in digital anvil and
doing stuff for Microsoft and is so we
don't really have any kind of room to
maneuver in the way that a publisher
won't give a date until it's got the
game to a certain level and I think
that's fine i think most of our backers
understand that but you know
occasionally some people don't and and
then you occasionally you know people
you know can read things like delayed
indefinitely and think things that
council which it is it so I mean we're
working hard and it's going to come out
and I think it's going to be you know I
mean it's going to be the first stage
but I think it'll be something that you
know p it's definitely going to be
different than say call of duty or
something like that right but it's
definitely the sort of fundamental one
of the major glues of star sister
because you can wander around the first
person you can get involved in combat on
ships you can either a across to them
and do all that kind of stuff so so with
the some of the changes you're talking
about from a traditional FPS like the
viewpoint of the camera is that stuff
you're having to go onto a CryEngine and
sort of rework some things to implement
all that I guess it's yeah i know we've
actually done that I mean we because
that we've been working on the FPS for
quite a while so we showed it back at
pax Australia and we were working on it
for we started working on sort of the
beginning of that you know the well just
before so in 2013 towards the end of it
we started working properly on the FPS
aspects and then we showed the first
iteration of pax Australia which was
believed November first or something in
Australia last year and then we showed
sort of an update to it pax east which
was in March so we've been doing a bunch
of work under the hood to the system
because inherently CryEngine is sort of
built to be separate between first and
third person so we've done a lot of work
to unify it we've also done a lot of
work to add these sort of extra sort of
bridge animations in there in a way that
you know I mean they didn't have you
know like the Jukes and all that kind of
stuff hasn't
been in crisis and stuff like that so
there there's a lot of work that's gone
on the hood so and hopefully when people
get to play they'll sort of appreciate
and see there but yeah it's a big
challenge and then the other issue is we
have to do that in such a way that I
mean the systems not stand alone so it
works inside the game so when you get
star marine it's got arena commander and
flying around in space and all the stuff
of moving around is the same stuff
that's used for when you're in your
spaceship and get up and walk around
your spaceship or get out an EV a so
it's all one system so it is always more
complicated because whenever we were
doing the FPS stuff we also have to make
sure that it's not breaking the other
stuff like this space flight stuff and
it does occasionally because stuff you
say we do it the characters can then
affect the character say in the
spaceships and then we have to fix that
so it just it just it just takes time
but you know with most of the technical
stuffs being done now and now it's
really sort of the polished level and
the polish level is very much that's
kind of a feel thing and that's kind of
that's hard to sort of say oh well we
can polish it in two days or five days
because sometimes you get a rate on the
animation and the feel of it and you
know you can have something that you
know you solve in a day and then you
have something that takes you weeks to
get the feel right because we're sort of
at the point now where it's a bit
subjective so you know once what's the
blend between sort of realistic movement
inertia and play a responsiveness right
you don't want the player to feel like
they're you know sort of drunk because
of you hang around and so those are all
the things that we've been sort of
focusing on so but you know I mean our
goal is to make you know make it as good
as we possibly can and you know like
everything in star citizen it's not you
know it shouldn't be a second-class
citizen it should be you know up there
with anything else that's a sort of
contemporary of it so those are all the
reasons why star marines taking a little
longer than we wanted to but at the end
of day I think it's you know I'm hoping
it'll be worth away especially once yeah
down the road we get you know all the
rest of the elements the game in
the persistent universe stuff squadron
42 and all comes together I think you
will ever will see the results of
getting these different modules out and
then iterating on a man doing it better
because even when we really start
worrying that still that's like the zero
and we've got lots of work and feedback
and we'll keep on improving and making
them better it's just the it's just a
process and we're building a really big
game it will take a long time to get all
working properly and to everyone's
satisfaction and probably longer than I
would like and you know a lot of our
backers would like that one wants to
play it now but the end of the day if it
works well yeah and the other thing at
the end of the day if you want to you
want to play a good game right he's
usually back something and you know so
yeah that you know i think you know
there's a pretty famous quote says
something like you know adelaide game
will be eventually good and the rush
game will always be bad as yeah but yeah
i mean that's the that's you know that's
the fundamental you know goal behind is
we want to release something that we
like that we think is going to be good
and other people will like and then we
can build on it from there right it
seems fair to me so but the immediate
future it looks like you're a couple
weeks out in the least and then
obviously there's no hard date right now
I kind of going through everything and
trying to get it fine tuned so that it
works though you want yeah let me wait
like as I wish we're shooting to try to
be on the PTU which is our sort of pre
release publicly to everyone so backers
can't get on the PTU but it's basically
a more unstable version sort of you know
enter your own risk sort of in the
game's con or slightly after games con
time frame and that's kind of where
we're we're looking to track so if we r
plus or minus there by a week too that's
kind of where I would expect us to fall
out and that really just depends on you
have trying to knock out some of these
last sort of polish issues that we're
trying to do for the base FPS right so
that is the FPS module update will have
another video on a multi crew
and so the headline could be now FPS is
back up FPS is not indefinitely it's not
definitely delayed yeah FPS is in
progress so there's the headlines
written for me check the channel for the
next video on multi crew and of course
thanks as always for your time Chris
you're welcome we'll see you all next
time you guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
