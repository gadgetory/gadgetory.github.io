hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the asrock x
570 Taichi motherboard so I'm not really
sure what the price point is supposed to
be for this board but it does look like
a pretty solid board so we'll go over it
and when it when it comes out you can
you know look at this video look at the
price decide if this is the board for
you before that this video is brought to
you by us and the GN store the best way
to support our independent reporting is
through store gamers nexus net this is
made possible with your purchases of
merch like our GN medium mod matte in
stock and shipping now and designed with
GPU teardown diagrams and grids our 100%
custom-made two-tone shirt is also a
great way to help and it's currently on
sale the shirt uses 95% cotton and 5% to
last in for a sporty fit with vibrant
colors and was designed entirely by the
GN team learn more at the link of the
description below or go to store
documents access net so let's get right
into it and we'll start with this
because this is the first relatively
high index 570 motherboard that I've
seen that doesn't have an entirely
unnecessary extra a pin fun fact
even if you have like the lowest over
the the cheapest lowest current spec
version of an 8 pin power connector it
can still handle 384 watts of power
unless you have a risin risin 3016 core
you're not getting even close to this
amount of power consumption and even on
the 16 core like this would very likely
be you would only hit that kind of
current draw on voltages are that are
not safe for long term usage so really
not a concern the like so so basically
you know the the fact that this board
has an 8 pin plus a 4 pin does not make
this motherboard any in any way inferior
to the motherboards that have to eight
pins because you're never gonna need the
second 8 pin while okay maybe on liquid
nitrogen it might be beneficial to like
plug in an extra 4 pin but for daily
usage definitely like the boards with a
single 8 pin or 8 pin in a 4 pin or a
pin and another 8 pin doesn't matter one
8 pin is more than enough especially if
your power supply comes in actual like
16 gauge cabling because if the the
motherboard uses the high current
version of the power connector then one
of these connectors that can handle
actually well in excess of
waltzes you end up with 13 amps per pin
pair for the high current term for the
high current version of the connector
and well at 13 amps per pin pair you can
do the math I haven't actually written
it down in my but now it's about 13
times 4 times 12 and you're gonna arrive
at the the kind of power you can push
through one of these 8 pins if your PSU
is up to like it is up to the task but
um yeah really not a like for daily
usage this is just a not a concern on
something like X 299 or X 99 or x79 it
becomes more of a concern because those
CPUs pull far more power than like
mainstream Intel or mainstream AMD CPUs
but uh yeah here like that the the extra
4 pin even here is unnecessary it's just
that I appreciate that we have a you
know motherboard where they don't go all
the way to 2 full like a whole
unnecessary a pin because I think it's
just silly and I also leads to like some
really dumb comments on the internet
which is the main main reason why I
cover a lot of things is just like when
well I as soon as I don't have to read
those comments anymore I'll stop talking
about those kinds of things so anyway
moving on we have a BIOS flash back
button then we have a clear CMOS button
back here so this is obviously super
handy if you have your motherboard
installed in a case like a normal person
and not like me I use test benches but
if you have your motherboard installed
in a case you know obviously having the
the clear CMOS button on the rear i/o
makes it much more convenient to recover
from any kind of major overclocking
fails because you don't have to open up
the system just to get at the clear CMOS
jumpers which you do have or the clear
CMOS button there's both here you also
get a postcode and a power button and a
reset button there's no dual BIOS
there's no real like advanced extreme
overclocking features on this
motherboard so you just kind of get the
bare minimum for well not the mayor
minimum like this is for an ambient
overclocking target a focused
motherboard this is more than enough as
far as I'm concerned this is not while
there's motherboards that are better
equipped if you wanted to actually go
for like liquid nitrogen overclocking
because you you start getting some extra
requirements where you run into issues
where you know if you clear the BIOS on
some other
that means you also have to go and pull
the whole system up to warm temperatures
because you won't be able to post at low
temperatures so yeah this board
obviously not meant for that but at
least you do have the the minimum for
sort of you know hit well it's not
minimum but the standard for like proper
ambient overclocking support the only
real complaint I have for the postcode
here is that it is under the last PCIe
slot which like the tons of boards do
this and it's always in my like the
postcode should be somewhere where you
can see it even if you have all your GPU
slot like all of your PCIe slots fully
populated right if you put three GPUs on
this motherboard or you buy like one of
those adult 2's SD cards with a fan in
it and you know there's a few of them
that are actually quite long it'll end
up covering of covering up the postcode
and then it's just like well you won't
be able to read it so that that won't be
very helpful then will it so yeah but
anyway we do have those kinds of
features here so you know at least
they're present even if they're not
implemented to my expectations but
that's mostly because asrock is actually
keeping this motherboard in the standard
ATX form factor so there really isn't
any space like in the usual area for you
know overclocking features there there's
just not any space because as Rock
decided that they want to have better
case compatibility so this board ends
right after the ATX screw hole whereas
there's a lot of boards that even at
this sort of praia suma this sort of
price range which actually end up being
like this this wide and with some cases
that can potentially be an issue so yeah
like you know it is a cult-like
as far as I'm concerned it's still a
compromise that I'm not a fan of but I
can kind of understand why they're doing
it anyway let's move on to the VR m and
the VR M is a 12 plus 2 phase
configuration which is actually less
phases than what you would get on like
an X 470 Taichi or an X 370 Taichi as
those were twelve plus four if I
remember correctly but uh that really
doesn't matter because the plus the the
SOC vrm right that power like it is only
really a concern if you're running a apu
and not a cpu so obviously this board is
meant
or probably merrily meant four CPUs and
it does have an HDMI output so you can
run an APU on it if you want to but it
like it just doesn't make sense to put
an APU and a board like this and then
actually use the a GPU of the APU to
like render your 3d like games right
like that that's the main thing is like
if the IGP if you're not actually using
the I GPU then the SOC vrm is kind of
irrelevant
so the SOC vrm really only matters if
you're gonna be really pushing an eye
GPU so very hot well not even really
high clock speeds it's just like if you
really want to max out the eye GPU you
need a you could benefit from having a
more powerful like a higher phase count
SOC VRM but like the this board's really
not meant for that so I don't really see
any issue with with what has rock has
done here and in terms of the control
scheme for the whole VR I'm we are
looking at a is l69 one four seven which
is actually a new chip I've not seen
this chip used on any other motherboards
yet and this is a seven phase voltage
controller from Intersil it's AMD
specific which is just kind of
interesting because most other boards
will go with like an IR three five two
zero one which works on AMD it also
works on Intel this chip is AMD
exclusive it does not support the Intel
voltage regulator standards at all which
might make it a little bit cheaper I
guess but anyway so here it is running
in a six plus one phase configuration so
the method that you know asrock uses to
get this 12 12 plus two-phase vrm is of
course a array of doublers on the back
of the board and we need to wait for
GIMP to do its thing otherwise it's
gonna be laggy there we go I don't know
why it why it's doing that it might be
just how did to open for too long but
anyway so we have one doubler for the
SOC vrm over here and then we got one
two three four five and six for the
vcore all of these doublers are the same
chip so these are all is l6 6 1 7 s from
inter silicon and the cool thing about
this doubler is that this actually does
current balancing so it gets you
slightly better efficiency than if you
just use a non current balancing doubler
because basically these will monitor the
current going through each phase and
they will extend or shorten PWM pulses
depending on which phase is doing more
work than the other phase so yeah that's
really really cool they also have the
option to run as to run both phases
synchronized so no doubling whatsoever
which it's not really doubling at that
point it's like the not really phases
it's like run the power stages
synchronized so you basically have one
phase except with like there's no III
can't actually think of a single reason
why if you have a six six one seven why
you would run it in that mode because it
doesn't really achieve anything if you
run it like that but if you are running
it as a doubler you can also have it as
doubler without the current balancing
enabled so as a bunch of configuration
options it's a it's a far more advanced
doubler than what you get with like a IR
3599 which you know the main focus of a
3599 is the fact that it can also
quadruple it's not that it's the the
best smartest doubler ever created so as
far as like doubled 12 phase vrm schemes
go this is one of the well basically the
the best one that i'm aware of like you
can't I can't really think of any
doublers that do what these do there's
other doublers that will do things like
fea pulse skipping to try to regain
current balance but nothing that will
actually extend and shorten your PWM
pulses in order to get proper current
balance and like you would if the
controller actually supported 12 phases
on its own well there's some limits on
how much they can extend the pulses but
still more better than what you'd get
with a lot of the other doublers out
there so control scheme in my book is
perfectly good here there's nothing to
complain about
and then for the actual power stages so
this whole vrm seems to be kind of a
really like bang for buck solution
because with the the power stages that
Oswalt has opted for they're using si
c63 4s from vishay semiconductor and
these are 50 amp
dr moth's parts and what dr moss stands
for is driver mosfet these are as dumb
as it gets when it comes to power
stages because there's literally all one
of these chips is is two MOSFETs and a
driver I see and actually it's not even
an IC at that one yeah a driver I see so
basically they don't do current
monitoring they don't do temperature
monitoring they don't do anything
internally which does make them really
really cheap you can get the SI c63 for
for like a dollar a piece in bulk
actually a little bit less than that but
it's round a dollar whereas some of the
smarter power stages you're looking at
you know two three four even five
dollars for something like an is l99 22
seven B and then there's you know the SI
c63 for you get a really powerful 50 amp
you know is rather powerful at 50 amps
current uh current output handling
capability but it's also really really
cheap because it's a bit dumb
note that that's a real issue it's like
honestly things like over current
protection and over temperature
protection being built into the power
stage as far as I'm concerned is that it
like those are things you need if you're
vrm is not quite big enough to power
that like is borderline able to power
the thing you're powering right if
you're vrm is significantly more
powerful than the highest power
consumption you know you're ever going
to be actually running through it then
you don't have to worry about an
overcurrent event because there's not
gonna be one because you're never gonna
overload the power stages right like the
OCP is there if you exceeded that fifty
50 amp current draw but this is a 12
phase that's 600 amps total current
output so you know with the rise in 3000
series CPU you don't need OCP on a power
stage like this because you'll never
ever get close to that kind of current
output in this kind of erm now if there
was four of them you know it might be
actually useful to have over temperature
and overcurrent protection because you'd
be running really close to the limits of
what these power stages can actually
handle but as it is it's just like yeah
you've got great efficiency and they're
a bit dumb who cares right you can still
do like the current monitor the voltage
controller still has current monitoring
because that like basically what happens
when you don't have the current
monitoring and temperature monitoring
built into the power stage you just have
to build your own circuit externally
somewhere on the board which isn't as
accurate as some of the current monitor
systems integrated in some of the latest
power stages but it's a lot cheaper so
yeah bang for buck kind of erm solution
here and the end result in terms of
efficiency is that for 1.2 volts out
output and 500 kilohertz switching
frequency this vrm is going to do a
hundred amps output at about 10 watts of
heat dissipation then 150 amps output
it's gonna do about 16 watts so heat
going up to 200 amps output it's gonna
do about 24 watts of heat and going up
to 300 amps so the the thing is is
basically this is the range in which a
risin 3000 series CPU might actually run
so like the 16 core is probably gonna
max out approaching 200 amps a little
bit below that with all probability and
then if you're looking at like a 12 core
or an 8 core you're gonna be looking at
150 amps or lower because in fact like
even on a if you took like a 2700 X
which up until like the 2700 X is the
highest power consumption CPU on am
before until we see the 12 core in the
16 core and the 2700 X if you actually
ran 150 amps into a 2700 X for an
extended period of time would degrade
very rapidly so yeah this vrm you know
covered like within the normal operating
range for risin 3000 series of CPUs like
this is more than enough right actually
for any rise in CPU you're basically
looking at ambient cooling you're gonna
be looking at sort of not even the 200
amp range like this is like 16 core only
everything else is going to be 150 amps
or lower and so there this vrm does
really really well right you don't even
for even for the 150 amps output this
vrm wouldn't necessarily need a heatsink
as that's only 16 watts of heat coming
off the entire vrm it has a good amount
of power stages right it has it takes up
a good amount of surface area so it
should be able to shed that heat all on
its own as like even without a heatsink
potentially depending on your case air
flow conditions right and of course as
Rob does actually ship this board with a
heatsink that heat sink
actually rather substantial so it
doesn't look like the the worst heatsink
I've ever seen but uh yeah I don't know
maybe the Steve will get a review sample
of this board and he'll do a test or
somebody else will do a test but on
paper that this looks rather solid and
in the current range that I would expect
a CPU like horizon 3000 series CPU to
run at on ambient this board has you
covered like it's really not a problem
24 watts does actually need a heatsink
but again this is a 12 phase it's spread
across a good amount of surface area on
its own so it's not as bad as when you
have like because there's 24 watts on a
like a four phase motherboard which is
not that uncommon on a lot of the X 470
boards especially the cheap racks were
seventy boards you'd be looking at
actually 24 watts at a lower current
output as well because this vrm is far
more efficient but there you really
really need a heatsink cos it's a four
phase know you know a 12 so still so
basically this is a really solid vrm for
just your day-to-day overclocking it's
just not the most insane one that we've
seen on X 570 so far now going up to 300
amps output which is like ln2
overclocking territory for like 27 I'm
not even sure 2700 X can hit that I
think it barely scrapes into that like
barely does over 250 amps I don't think
it even quite reaches 300 amps on liquid
nitrogen and then if you're looking at
the 16 core I'm not actually sure what
that'll hit but it might be able to do
300 or maybe even more than that but
this board would not be the ideal
selection for that kind of load as it
would be producing about 44 watts of
heat at that point and that's heatsink
and air flow required territory and then
going up to 400 amps you'd be looking at
about 71 watts of heat and 500 amps
about 86 watts of heat so basically you
know like in the theoretical range this
board is not ideal but for where I
assume like obviously as welcoming and
like as far as I can tell Ezra intends
this board to be sort of like a lower
like major it's basically a really
mid-range board right it gives you a
really good mix of basically everything
and yeah they're the vrm is perfectly
adequate and really really capable and
then it's like of course it's not gonna
it's not gonna compete with some of the
you know 14 phase of VR M's that we see
on like the the flagship x5 70
motherboards so yeah really not about a
not a bad VR I'm the as rocks gonna for
here I don't really have any complaints
it's not the most powerful but it's also
definitely not the worst I mean there
are like yeah this is a solid of erm
there's not much else to it now the SOC
vrm uses more of the 50 amp fish ADR
Moss components and we're not really
gonna talk about the SOC of erm
efficiency this this voltage regulator
doesn't need to push anywhere near as
much power as the V Corps so this is
going to be fine
this is quite frankly overkill you can
build significantly weaker phases and
still run an SOC v like still run the
system of a system on a chip portion of
a rise in CPU just fine so no concerns
with that for me and that pretty much
covers the the CPU power delivery I mean
it's not the best but it's definitely
not the worst it's actually you know I
think it's kind of the sweet spot for
what you want to have in terms of a VR
m4 for a Rison 3000 series CPU because
you get really really good efficiency in
the sort of current range well 200 amps
pushing it a little bit but definitely
in the sort of reasonable end of the
current range this this is really really
solid so yeah
nothing no complaints from me for for
this VR I'm right here considering you
know what I assume this board is
targeting in terms of its especially
like in terms of it's sort of like
target audience or whatever I don't know
anyway moving on to the memory of erm so
asrock is one of the manufacturers that
just insists on doing two phase memory
power so we have that the MOSFETs are
dual n FETs from a Fairchild
Semiconductor so those are fdpc 50 30s
jeez they're not the best duo line if
that's ever created but ddr4 really
doesn't pull that much power so it's not
an issue the controller for them is
a yupi 1647 i meanwe 1674 p and that's a
two-phase so this is a real two-phase
memory of erm which yeah like there this
is more than enough memory power for
really anything the main concern with
ddr4 is basically what happens between
the C key the CPU socket and the memory
slots and in that department I mean if
we look at the back of the board we can
actually see it which right it has to
load Mike my daily system is a pile of
garbage anyway but if we actually look
at the back of the board we can actually
can we oh that's interesting I thought
this was gonna be a daisy chain board
but it looks like they're doing teach
apology because you can just about you
can just about make out this trace how
it goes here and then it goes one back
and one there and so there's your
there's your teach apology tea right
there now that's interesting because as
far as I know as rock really likes their
daisy chains at least on Zee 390 so I
did not think yeah so we can only see
this memory channel here and yeah that's
a that's another tea right there right
you can see that trace comes in doesn't
actually connect to anything there's a
little Junction and splits like that we
can so that's a teat apology that's
really really interesting I did not
think anybody would run a like even
gigabyte has gone to like freakin daisy
chain so I thought it was just gonna be
everybody doing it now what seems like
Al Roker decided they want to be special
so well that that doesn't make me wonder
so the the thing about the teach apology
memory layout because I didn't know this
was a teach apology I was convinced this
was a daisy chain I'm writing that wrong
so t-top so the the thing about the date
like the the teach apology layout is it
works really well if you're running for
sets like four sets of memory
well four memory sticks not four sets of
memory sticks that doesn't make any
sense that'd be like eight memory sticks
or something but yeah it works really
really well if you actually well it's
optimized for fully populated
motherboards so I guess this might be a
really good board for like for like age
in theory
this should be really good for like four
by eight gigs for by 16 gigs and for by
32 gigs which I guess makes sense cuz uh
well no because this isn't the creator
board right like asrock has a different
motherboard that's like targeted at
content creators and it's just like
there it makes sense to have support for
the biggest baddest amount of memory you
could possibly have because the thing is
teach apology straight-up sacrifices
some memory speed on to 2 by 8 2 by 16
and 2 by 32 configurations so yeah that
is that is interesting I really thought
that it was a good abuse teaching and
then I look at the back and it's like
wait what
that's a teat apology so yeah basically
like the so with teat apology
I've already seen somebody do on a good
T to apology memory layout like thirty
six hundred megahertz across 32 gigs of
ram on Rison 2nd gen so with Rison third
gen this could actually turn into like
making this board really really good for
people who want to run you know 32 gigs
of ram or like high quantities of memory
at relatively high speeds this should
work really really well for that because
daisy-chain tends to like daisy chain
biases towards to dims only so yeah that
is that is very interesting though cuz I
was like I would have thought gigabytes
decided to go daisy chain than I ever
thought asrock would do like everybody
would at that point because gigabyte is
like the only one on x4 70 that runs
teat apology actually I wonder if that
might not oh man okay and end of like no
more tangents yeah so memories uh memory
configuration is cheese apology so you
like it shouldn't hurt too much on to
dims but it's definitely not gonna be
ideal on to dims and the difference you
can see on to dims with unlike at each
apology board is anything from like you
can see something like say 4000
megahertz on to dames versus 40 200
megahertz on for dames or 40 40 300
megahertz on Fordham's depending on how
the teat apology is implemented on also
what the memory controller can do so
that example I just gave is from like Z
390
I'm not sure how it works out with the
new memory controller on the Rison 3000
series CPUs it might turn out to be
absolutely terrible under all
circumstances but I'm expecting so yeah
that is still interesting so this is a
tea topology board and I'm pretty much
covers everything I wanted to talk about
in this video I mean we've done the
we've done the vrm the memory the little
various overclocking features so yeah
that's it for the video thanks for
watching like share subscribe leave any
comments questions suggestions down in
the comment section below and if you'd
like to you know support gamers Nexus
you can like support gamers Nexus more
direct whatever there's stored gamers
Nexus dotnet if you'd like to pick up
some gamers Nexus merch and if you'd
like to support us directly and don't
want to buy anything there's the gamers
Nexus patreon so there's links to both
down down below the video and those do
help out with the channel immensely and
if you'd like to see more content from
me I have a channel called actually
hardcore overclocking where I do
overclocking things that's literally all
the content on there is just
overclocking things so yeah that's it
for the video thanks for watching and
