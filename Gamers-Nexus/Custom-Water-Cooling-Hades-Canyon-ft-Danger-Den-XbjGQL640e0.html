our Hades River content and we were
gonna do a stream but ended up getting a
note via email from the founder of
danger den if anyone remembers them they
made a lot of really cool acrylic case
parts and things like that and they
messaged me and he said hey we saw your
video on Hades Canyon actually we have a
way better solution than 30 zip ties and
a closed loop liquid cooler our solution
is this so this is a custom made as far
as I'm aware it's it's either one or
very close to one off but I'm gonna I'm
gonna call it a one-off it's a custom
made basically a torture rack that'll
fit Hades Canyon I think and then
there's your reservoir and the more
important part is that he shipped over
this custom block for it so it'll fit
the vrm the GPU the CPU and I think
probably the HBM as well but I'm not
sure so what we're gonna do now is put a
custom loop on Hades Canyon see if we
can get it up to 5 gigahertz for an
overclock at which point it'll be better
than a lot of desktop CPUs before that
this video is brought to you by I fix
it's brand new man 2 driver kit the
iFixit Manta kit is a universal repair
tool kit that includes 112 steel bits
redesigned from the ground up with
longer necks four four millimeter bits
allowing more precision when working on
components the $60 iFixit Manta kit has
everything from pentalobe drivers to why
drivers and standard bits
learn more at the link in the
description below so for the parts this
is pretty straightforward this block
it's just a coward block acrylic on top
and there are a couple not really micro
fins but just copper fins in there and
either way it's going better than our
solution here because even though this
solution is a pretty good liquid cooler
280 silently cooler from be quiet even
though it's pretty good on its own we
don't have enough vertical like straight
down shear mounting pressure to really
press the cold plate against the the
components and what that was causing an
our Hades Canyon overclocking results
where we pushed it really far past what
it could be handled on the stock air
cooler we pushed way past what this
thing could do because that's what was
on there originally that versus a 280 mm
cooller that's bigger than the board
itself so we pushed way past what it
could do stock but still ran into
thermal problems eventually up towards
the four point seven gigahertz range on
the CPU and stock it's between four
point two and four point three gigahertz
four point seven is pretty respectable
if I say so myself and the GPU is
something like thirteen twenty two
thirteen fifty megahertz
there was one test we do thirteen
seventy it's a it's a Vega GPU so quite
good as well but we still ran into their
own problems and that's because the
mounting pressure so first thing we need
to do is take apart my old solution and
start prepping it for the danger dam
solution which by the way the danger dam
folks now have just basically a I think
a hobbyist modding website that you
should check out I think it's moonlight
mod calm if you want to check them out
that's what they're up to these days
so pretty simple to start out here I'm
just gonna snap one of these per side
just so we don't like destroy the the PC
because already kind of bending and in
fact when I got the email from the
danger done folks it basically said
please don't destroy your Hades Canyon
system let me send you something better
so anyone who saw the first one you
might remember I put a ton of thermal
paste on here a lot of it ended up on
the outside the reason I put a lot on
there was because we knew this plate
would be sliding around while
mountainous we'd obviously to have a
proper mounting solution so that was
expected and it looks like it still
needed more thermal paste than what we
had like those it actually just we only
got one shot at this better make it good
all right so what we're gonna do is a
test alignment I actually don't oh they
did ten screws over there okay so they
said screws for this not sure how this
line up but let's figure it out I guess
these are interesting are these
different heights that might explain
something I think these are different
heights so this plate that was sent in
this part over here is very slightly
higher than this part over here and
looking at the Hades Canyon stuff it
looks like the GPU is actually a
slightly raised over the CPU so if
that's intentional then this part needs
to be on the CPU ok well that might
explain why the GPU is doing so much
better
thermally than the CPU in our follow up
testing with this thing because it looks
like the CPU is slightly lower than the
GPU and HBM which I didn't notice before
didn't notice until this didn't seem
level and now it makes a lot of sense so
if that's genuinely the case and to my
eye it looks like it but I'm not sure
then we should already have better
results from this so what do we need we
need thermal pads and we need thermal
paste and some screws and I think
that'll be most of it up until we get to
the liquid part right I I have plenty of
thermal pads myself but the the folks
who sent us this cooling setup sent a
separate letter later and said oops
forgot to include the thrown pad sorry
so we're gonna go ahead and use those
since they did actually bother to send
us out pad specifically for this I'm
gonna have to cut them the size so we
don't have any chokes coverage but that
should be okay i think i think the
chokes will be fine
they're just giant copper coils anyway
so that should be fine
all right so thrown pads are going on
top of the MOSFETs which will get
reasonably hot but they can take a lot
of heat so that's fine and airflow for
the chokes this vrm is not particularly
powerful it's pretty good for what it is
but we have a vrm analysis of this up on
the channel by builds I'd if you're
curious about how good the vrm has
checked it out he also because we don't
know full details on this particular vrm
just because it would be hard to get a
lot of details he ends up using that
video as it means to explain and teach
what his vrm analysis videos look at so
you check that out alright so now we
just need thermal paste I'm just gonna
pull I think some cryo not off the wall
probably a lot of people previously
we're asking us why don't you use liquid
metal which we have some up there or we
have actually we have some right here to
conduct or not so asking why why don't
you just look good medal for this well
it's already direct eye contact so
that's doing most of the work you're not
really gaining a whole lot once you're
already direct I by going with liquid
metal and more importantly it's
conductive so it's a huge pain in the
ass because I'd have to paint over any
SMDs we don't want to impact and it's
just kind of annoying to get the
coverage I would need with liquid metal
and the gains are going to be basically
zero this is not conductive I get this
all over everything so I'm actually
going to apply too much here because I
don't know how much that block is gonna
move around while I'm trying to install
it I'd rather have too much that comes
out of the edges then not have enough
and have beared icon or a bare die with
no no interface what you saw when we
uncapped it I put a ton of their own
paste on there last time and taking the
thing apart just now it still wasn't
really fully covered so this should be
good for us it is on the heavy side but
that's fine
that's the whole point
not can I hurt by having too much
because it'll get pushed out the sides
hey we're gonna do a quick excursion and
I'm gonna run hot water through this
block just to clean it out and it's got
some dirt in there just from shipping
and we're going to scrub the bottom too
what now
another tweet stop it stop tweeting at
gamers Nexus you're messing up my videos
alright so this is pretty clean now
condensation but that's fine it's a
water cooler there's still some dirt in
there I'm gonna try and hit the bottom
of it with rubbing alcohol and then
we'll be good to go I think that's
reasonable ok so it's not the most
perfect piece of copper in the world but
it's a prototype it's a one-off that's
fine so we're gonna put this down and
give this orientation a shot for
building this loop and you also need to
make sure do these actually thread into
this thing someone just tweeted at me
again this video is not even live yet
and they're doing it turn it just to
spite me
okay so we definitely have contact now
the PCB is not bending I think not
bending too much anymore not like he
used to be bending so I would definitely
better overall and I think there's
contact and I don't think it's excessive
I know there's contact I don't think
it's excessive so now you need to start
filling the loop and get it doing a test
run so we can see if it looks like it's
actually pulling properly but we've got
the V RMS taken care of so that's cool I
think the next step here is probably
mount it to the danger den chassis or
the danger den successor the spiritual
successor to danger dead and moonlight
mods chassis and see what we can do with
a pump set up at that point so we're
gonna start mounting this into the new
frame so this is gonna mount up here I
guess or is it gonna fit okay I need to
get there we go how to magnetize a
screwdriver step one of ten magnet step
two one more screw to hold in the PCB
this is gonna be really cool so I'm
pretty excited about this cuz basically
we've turned the haiti's Canyon nook
into a proper desktop computer and if
the overclocking goes as I want it to
it's gonna be just about as powerful as
one where you're gonna be limited by the
power adapter so that's a big question
mark right now is if we're getting
limited to 230 watts out of that thing
is that gonna be enough to power an
overclock on this once it's all done
being be stood out for this mod ek water
blocks pump I think I have an adapter
that will allow us to mount it right
here
second route the liquid under so here's
our dilemma right now if I were on a
stream I just asked everybody as soon as
you keep tweeting me even though I asked
you not there I guess he can hear me
anyway but the thought is can either
take this is from the titan v-- stream
it has a suit on fan a Vardar and a bag
that fan it was used to get us one of
the top four World Records for time spy
I think so we've got that that's a 360
it's a good performer but this thing is
not built for a 360 millimeter radiator
so I could do it 240 here and the only
reason I like the idea of a about 240 is
because it fit really cleanly down here
I put this on top of the mounting
bracket on top of the radiator and it'd
be pretty good
there's not really a downside to that
except I would have to go get it ha ha
that's waving downside so alternatively
we put a 360 in and I can even just kind
of stand it next to the thing in which
case our radiators bigger than the
entire case holding the device or maybe
we like to stick this through here and
and then all the same principles would
apply
it's just gigantic so in this instance
either way fans will push air up and
through the rest of the board so the
rest of the board will have cool and if
your items will have general coolness
this will be a bit of a hot spot up here
but that's fine
so the question is what do I do
it's Who I like the idea of a 240 and
how compact it would be because it feels
true to the Hades Canyon nook and you
could still argue that you can take it
places even though no one ever would but
also I like the idea of having a 360
millimetre radiator
that's like three times the volume of
the entire PCB cooling Hayes Canyon
components to be fair I mean
theoretically they're almost be a bit
lower with this and theoretically for
every 10 degrees drop in temperature we
should have about a 4% drop in power
leakage that would give us some more
power back against our 230 watt wall
adapter so I'm gonna say we try this
tube routings gonna be kind of kind of
gross I think another thing yeah okay so
I think what we're gonna do is probably
like I want to run tubes under here I
think if I wanted to be clean and I want
to use the reservoir on the front I
still have some blue fluid so that would
be really cool to use as well if I can
make it like purple I would be like a
blue and red that would be cool so okay
I need to figure out the tube route in
here so we jump ahead in time a bit this
is what we came up with it's if we
time-lapse that you'll see after I kind
of figured out what to do it didn't take
too long but basically I'll walk you
through what's going on so first all the
skull in the Front's really cool and the
way they built it the the moonlight mods
guys the way they did it is basically
there's a tube coming in here and the
tube is it enters into the chamber I
guess I don't know if it's an acrylic
housing but it enters in and pushes it
up on an angle up against the wall at a
trajectory inversely proportional
basically like equivalent to the angle
of the skull so when the liquid goes up
and hits the top of the skull it spins
in a circle it shows up really well on
our timeline or in our footage of
filling the the pump and down side was
that the I didn't go through and double
check that everything was tight so that
the cap that was in here originally was
not tight all the way fortunately only
leaked a little bit I'm leak testing it
so what that means is this system is
completely off right now the only thing
that's on is a power supply powering the
pump which is obviously running liquid
through it so we're gonna let this run
for about 24 hours full
and I'm gonna put paper towels
everywhere if there's any sign of I've
marked where the liquid is roughly on
the reservoir so if there's any sign of
leakage we'll know but if it's not
leaking we can go ahead and attach the
system as far as the loop goes that I'm
really happy with it the way I routed it
in the end as you can see in our
time-lapse footage is basically I did
the outtake straight into the block
obviously the block for the CPU vrm and
hpm and GPU then goes into the skull
reservoir and it goes in on the right
side which is important because that's
how you get that spinning effect nearly
did it the other way and I'm glad I
didn't and then we're using some of
these bent fittings from ek so we've got
several of these some of them are
90-degree some are just kind of soft
angles so that goes into the radiator
which is a 360 I'll remind you comes out
of the radiator goes under the Nook and
back into the reservoir the pump and
reservoir so it's really cool the I
think the ideal use for this would be a
240 radiator in the bottom and then just
a pump and then use their reservoir it's
not a lot of liquid but you only have
one block in there and if you've got a
240 radiator there's plenty to go around
so that'd probably be the ideal way to
do it it's not I think we'll get a bit
more thermal Headroom for sure with this
setup because I've got three
high-powered fans on here there's a ton
of liquid way more volumes and then the
CPU could ever hope to need and saturate
so we'll be good there it'll give us a
bit more overhead and it's just kind of
cool because I mean the radiator is
bigger than the entire thing so that's
fun too plus it's the radiator that got
us top 4 ish in the world record
rankings for time spy vs. lioness in the
rip ltte stream so yeah that's the loop
over all basically pump and Rose combo
reservoir in the front which seems to no
longer be leaking so that's good thing
360 rad which is the LC solution cool
stream PE need to work on that name EK
the the cool stream p on the bottom and
then we've got the custom block from
danger
folks or former danger den folks I
should say and I think for the fans I'll
just do a mixture of soon on maglevs
which are soon on and maybe a Vardar or
something and I think that will wrap up
our fans pretty well so other than that
our next objective is to see if this
goes past four point seven gigahertz
this time and if we run into a power
limitation so now the plan is run the
leak test and we're gonna do a live
stream for this so we're gonna basically
go through all the benchmarks again and
just try and see if we can stabilize but
I don't know over four point seven
gigahertz I hope before hitting a power
wall and for that we're looking at
probably mid next week so that would be
maybe the 23rd or somewhere around there
23rd 24th Wednesday Thursday we'll
announce this on Twitter so twitter.com
slash gamers Nexus or on Facebook as
well and we'll also try to announce it
in one of the next videos but looking at
doing the livestream of it sometime next
week basically so yeah next possible
bottleneck is gonna be power 4 which I
don't presently have a solution but
we'll see how far we can go with this
setup and then maybe try and solve it so
that's it for this one
thank you to the folks that moonlight
mods aka danger den for sending this
over it's a lot of fun to work with
looks really good and the skull has
darkened now so for those of you who are
who are more familiar with open loops
I'd be curious what your thoughts are on
why that's happened I don't think it's
dirt because the rest of the loop is not
dark but either way it looks pretty good
so now we just need to see if the
performance is good and that's it for
this one subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow next stops out
directly go to store documents nexus net
pick up the GN mod mat it's on backorder
if you order soon ish you will
definitely get one for the next round I
I have to say that I like the mat even
more after working with it with liquid
cooling because I got a lot liquid on
here and it's held up like a beast so
check that out on the store store that
gamers ex has done that thanks for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
