history museum and I'm joined by Jim
Vincent yes who it was out here at GGC
with us and now we've been shooting some
cool stuff inside the computer history
museum in Mountain View California and
what was some of the coolest stuff we
saw give us a quick run-through well I
thought the coolest thing we saw was the
first disk drive which was the RAM Mac 5
megabytes of storage for renting a
machine with it was thirty thousand
dollars a month and I guess in our day
we're going to see the end of the disks
or in the next few years so yeah this is
the beginning and we're gonna see the
end we saw some of the first fast
transistorized computers like the IBM
stretch which was millions of dollars
and they only built nine of them in the
crane wine we took ray 1 and the
ten-million-dollar be seriously I wasn't
here this time but previously we saw
something called the Babbage machine
which is as the mechanical a mechanical
computer from the 1800s they tried to
build the one that was a full computer
but they never managed the manufacturers
to heart called the analytical engine so
we saw a simpler version which was
called The Difference Engine right and
then there's a PDP machine really the
PDP one which was the game made the
first computer game Space wars and it
actually actually if you go here at
certain times they'll actually demo
space where where you can actually play
it on the hardware from 1960 damn cool
so there's a whole I read a history book
on this not long ago and as you were
saying basically first computer game de
pana how you look at the oscilloscope
games yo and then I multiplayer to it
was multiplayer two-player game yeah and
that was I mean that's a big deal i was
a sort of smash hit on college campuses
and things like that and that machine
had a whopping nine kilobytes of memory
yeah and was how expensive was it doing
now they had the price it was a hundred
and twenty thousand dollars something
something right for a nine kilobyte
machine in 1961 right I took him a large
amount of space yeah how big a lot of
electricity here you would he would pay
big Bill's on that one yeah yeah we were
not allowed to use flash or any
additional lighting because none of the
artifacts
can they don't want any the artifacts
damage but any ambient light so it was
pretty damn old I mean we saw like
analog computers in there yeah we saw a
memory from computers from 1951 there's
pieces of an even older computer called
Nene ACK but because it's privately
owned we were not allowed to photograph
it but if you come and see it for your
own personal purposes you can actually
take a picture of it we did see the
univac now we saw parts of the universe
ya know part of whatever part of what's
ever left yeah went through it mercury
memory well I had mercury delay memories
one where they sent sound waves done
vickery tubes and with cycle rides a
refresh was how long it took from the
Mercury's wave to get down into its own
there's an movie too yeah and I sent
some waves down it right vibrations and
then well you know one ball you know
vibration be a 1 &amp;amp; no vibration be 0
right based on the timing and it would
have to recycle it and it would cut you
have a copy it back right moving they
would have to resend it again right
unless you changed it and we also want a
vacuum tube stop yeah so vacuum tubes
predated transistors yeah everything's
on transistors now have billions of them
and some stuff like the new we just saw
that past is a Pascal Tesla p100 yeah 15
billion trends writers write and then
vacuum tubes were sort of physical
actual tubes like glass too yeah i think
the sage is one of the biggest vacuum
tube computers i believe it had 40,000
tubes and it had a whopping 256
kilobytes of memory our kilobytes to
infants kilobytes on a huge unit and
this thing took four stories of a
building yessum family buildings I know
is the most expensive computer ever made
they don't even really say what it costs
but it it's in the tens of billions of
dollars through those devices yes I
think they built above 23 of them Andy
is the four stories right and then they
had the the one thing that stands out
the most to me there's like console that
had like a cigarette lighter yeah every
day every console on the sage came with
a ashtray and a cigarette lighter like
you'd see in your car you know you press
it in and you get that yeah so that's
convenient for 1950s the convenient from
the time at the I'm assuming everybody
that worked on the MERS is dead
he's a very serious smoking being one of
them right so that okay that was the
that was yeah I'm sage and say it stands
for something I was used for defense
right it's a big defense from it was a
big defense to for Russian bombers
coming with nuclear weapons once the
Russia had all these missiles it was
pretty obsolete but they did run that's
crazy thing 458 into the early 80s I
think the last one was turned off in
1983 so they ran this thing for a long
time let's talk about some of the
earlier supercomputers so the Cray one
cray one was 76 I think something like
that the we saw the stretch which was
nineteen sixty one right it was the
fastest computer in the at the time yes
stretch model 70 30 i believe yeah I
worked on a Cray 1s by the way back in
the 80s and I thing was running at a
whopping 70 megahertz they've got about
a hundred and seventy mega flops so
you're getting what I out of a flop out
of a Pascal you're getting a double
precision talent Precision's not as much
fun yeah three three and a half yeah
teraflop versus 150 gigaflops on a 10
million dollar machine from 1976 FP 32 I
think 10.6 teraflops if you care about
FP 16 and 20 teraflops Cray was FB 64
was it yeah it have it did indeed well
and it was sort of like a VX that you'd
see on a modern Intel the vectors read
where they were 64 long instead of I
think they're smaller on on a navy X but
of course that was single core and
across from the Centers stretch too cray
and then we saw some of the older pcs to
with so the apple one yeah well on what
it spawned from the Xerox machine that's
right the Xerox PARC right so we saw the
Xerox PARC and that was 74 74 and next
to that in the computer history museum
was the first prototype of a mouse made
out of wood yeah that was from the 60s
applicant technically it was a it was a
copy but it was in the early 60s it made
out of water had one red switch on and
that was your mouth
spot yeah look like a it didn't look too
comfortable yeah it's literally holding
a wood block it's what it is and I did
have a ball in it how did it yeah it had
a with a wheel in each direction so they
actually had wheels she'd roll it this
way and when was just XY just XY I never
would have to calculate their the
diagonal and near that we saw something
earlier mice that were there's like a
three-button ugly beige thing that was
from the Burke I was really yeah the one
that was a rapist said the wood mouse
was from the park so that was the park
we saw the sum of the first Windows
machines along with a half of one they
had original IBM PC right from 1981 they
have them lots of they have a lot here
it's worth visiting yeah quite the place
yeah absolutely they had a lot of
consoles to the original you know that
Terry 2600 which probably there's a
thousand of them for sale on eBay right
even though they're from the 70s there's
plenty of modern stuff I definitely
considered modern I think yeah compared
to some of the other stuff we saw but
the Atari 2600 there was I mean they had
everything up to halo basically it which
is yeah how does modern as a cat so a
very cool place that computer history
museum this is in mauve you my mule
California right so if you ever out here
it's worth a check and then intel has a
museum to it's a lot i think sort of
personally less impressive on this one
wait less impressive but that's all
intel but it's free it's busy this one
you gotta pay like fifteen dollars yeah
which is really not bad not bad if
you're nearby the check out the intel
one as well because you can see some of
the old wafers and stuff yeah a couple
waivers in here there's some city and in
the original microprocessor the 4000 for
right and then which became the eight
thousand eight and then the 8088 which
was the pie BMP see ya 286 486 yeah all
derivative yeah so that's in the
mountain view area as well but as always
if you liked this coverage at the
patreon link the push for video check
out the Computer History Museum online i
believe they
youtube channel as well they have a
youtube channel and thanks for watching
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
