History Museum and I'm joined by Jim
Vincent yes whoo it was out here at GGC
with us and now we've been shooting some
cool stuff inside the Computer History
Museum in Mountain View California
and what was some of the coolest stuff
we saw give us a quick run-through well
I thought the coolest thing we saw was
the first disk drive which was the RAM
Mac 5 megabytes of storage for renting a
machine with it was $30,000 a month and
I guess in our day we're gonna see the
end of this or in the next few years so
yeah this is the beginning and we're
gonna see the end we saw some of the
first fast transistorized computers like
the IBM stretch which was millions of
dollars and they only built nine of them
and the crane line we saw a Cray one and
the 10 million dollar machine wasn't
here this time but previously we saw
something called the Babbage machine
which is a mechanical computer from the
1800s they tried to build the one that
was a full computer but they never
managed the manufacturer it was too hard
called the analytical engine so we saw a
simpler version which was called the
difference engine right and then there's
a PDP machine the PDP one which was the
game made the first computer game space
Wars and it actually actually if you go
here at certain times they'll actually
demo space where where you can actually
play it on the hardware from 1960 damn
cool so there's a hole I read a history
book on this not long ago and as you
were saying basically first computer
game Japan how you look at the
oscilloscope games yeah and then a
multiplayer - it was multiplayer
two-player game yeah and that was I mean
that's a big deal I was a sort of smash
hit on college campuses and things like
that and that machine had a whopping
nine kilobytes of memory yeah and was
how expensive was it doing now they had
the price it was a hundred and twenty
thousand dollars something right for a
nine kilobyte machine in 1961 great I
took him a large amount of space yeah
how big it's a lot of electricity here
you would he would pay big bills on that
one yeah yeah we were not allowed to use
flash or any additional lighting because
none of the artifacts
they don't want any of the artifacts
damaged but any ambient light it's
always pretty damn old I mean we saw
like analog computers in there yeah we
saw a memory from computers from 1951
there's pieces of an even older computer
called Nene AK but because it's
privately owned we were not allowed to
photograph it but if you come and see it
for your own personal purposes you can
actually take a picture of it we did see
the univac now we saw parts of the
universe yeah you know part of whatever
parts of what's ever left yeah when
mercury memory I had mercury delay
memories one where they sent sound waves
down Wickery tubes and with cycle right
it's a refresh was how long it took from
the Mercury's wave to get down into it
yeah and I sent sound waves down it
right vibrations and then well you know
one by you know vibration would be a 1 &amp;amp;
no vibration be a zero right based on
the timing and then it would have to
recycle it it would cut you have to copy
it back right they would have to resend
it again right unless you changed it and
we also want a vacuum to be stopped yeah
so vacuum tubes predated transistors
yeah everything's on transistors now
have billions of them and some stuff
like the new we just saw that past
pascal tesla p100 yeah 15 billion
transmitters right and then vacuum tubes
were sort of physical actual tubes like
glass - yeah I think the sage is one of
the biggest vacuum tube computers I
believe it had 40,000 tubes and it had a
whopping 256 kilobits of memory our
kilobytes to infinity of kilobytes on a
huge unit and this thing took four
stories yes I know it was the most
expensive computer ever made they don't
even really say what it cost but if it's
in the tens of billions of dollars
through those devices yes I think they
built above 23 of them is the four
stories right and then they had the the
one thing that stands out the most to me
there's like console that had like a
cigarette lighter yeah every K every
console on the sage came with a ashtray
and a cigarette lighter like you'd see
in your car you know you press it in and
you get that yeah
so that's convenient for 1950s I'm
assuming everybody that worked on the
MIR
smoking being one of them that was the
sage and sage stands for something that
was used for defense right it's a big
defense from it was a big defense to
four Russian bombers coming with nuclear
weapons one silly Russia had all these
missiles it was pretty obsolete but they
did run this crazy thing 458 into the
early eighties I think the last one was
turned off in 1983 so they ran this
thing for a long time now let's talk
about some of the earlier supercomputers
so the cray-1 Cray one was 76 I think
something like that the we saw the
stretch which was 1961 right it was the
fastest computer in the at the time yes
stretch model 70 30 I believe yeah I
worked on a Cray 1 s by the way back in
the 80s and I thing was running at a
whopping 70 megahertz they've got about
a hundred and seventy mega flops so are
you're getting what out of a flop out of
a pascal you're getting a double
precision talon precision it's not as
much fun yeah three three and a half
yeah teraflop versus 150 Giga mega flop
on a 10 million dollar machine from 1976
FP 32 I think 10.6 teraflops did he care
about FP 16 and 20 teraflops Cray was F
P 64 was it yeah well and it was sort of
like a BX that you'd see on a modern
Intel the vectors rather where they were
64 long instead of I think they're
smaller on an on an AV X but of course
that was single core and cross front so
there's a stretch to Cray and then we
saw some of the older pcs - with Apple
one yeah well on what a spawn from the
Xerox machine that's right the Xerox
PARC right so we saw the Xerox PARC and
that was 74 74 and next to that in the
Computer History Museum was the first
prototype of a mouse made out of wood
yeah that was from the 60s it was a it
was a copy but it was something there
early 60s it may have one I had one red
switch on and that was your mouse button
yeah look like it didn't look too
comfortable yeah
it's literally holding a woodblock it's
what it is
and I did have it ballin it how did it
yeah it had a wheat wheel in each
direction so they actually had wheels to
roll it this way and when so just XY
just XY and that would have to calculate
the diag no and near that we saw
something earlier mice that were there's
like a 3-button ugly beige thing that
was from the park
yeah the one that was a rapist said that
would Mouse was from the park so that
was the park
we saw the some of the first Windows
machines along with a half of one they
had original IBM PC right from 1981 they
have lots of they have a lot here it's
worth visiting yeah quite the place yeah
absolutely they had a lot of consoles to
the original you know that Terry 2600
which probably there's a thousand of
them for sale on eBay right even though
they're from the 70s there's plenty of
modern considered modern I think yeah
compared to some of the other stuff we
saw but the Atari 2600 there was I mean
they had everything up to Halo basically
it was yeah that was modern as a cat so
a very cool place though Computer
History Museum this is in Monrovia
montréal California right yeah so if you
ever out here it's worth a check and
then Intel has a museum - it's a lot I
think sort of personally less impressive
than this one way less impressive but
that's all in town but it's free it's
this one you gotta pay like $15 yeah if
you're nearby the check out the Intel
one as well because you can see some of
the old wafers and stuff yeah a couple
waivers in here there's some city in the
original microprocessor the four
thousand four right and then which
became the eight thousand eight and then
the 80 88 which was the bipm PC yeah 286
486 yeah all derivative yeah so that's
in the mountain view area as well but as
always if you like this coverage at the
patreon link the post roll video check
out the Computer History Museum online I
believe they have
YouTube channel as well they have a
YouTube channel and thanks for watching
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
