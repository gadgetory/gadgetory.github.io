Donette and today we're making an ESD
grounding cable so ESD as many of you
likely know stands for electrostatic
discharge and that's a bad thing that's
when if you touch something in cold dry
weather for instance and you feel like a
shock to your card or that's that's ESD
that's electrostatic discharge and if
you do that to a computer component you
will definitely damage it if it's a high
enough voltage and to give an idea of
thins when we emit a charge that is
something you can feel as a human it can
be thousands of volts and a CPU for
example can take about one maybe two
volts depending on the manufacturer and
the CPU so it's not going like a couple
thousand volts that will kill it or
severely damage it and to reduce the
chance of ESD when system building you
can use things like ESD wrist straps
they're not perfect they're a nice
gesture but if you utilize them
incorrectly if you don't connect them to
true ground on the grounding end then
it's not going to do anything so for a
surefire way to ground yourself before
working on a system we can make our own
grounding cable and this only requires a
normal power cable that you get with
your power supply so if you have an
extra one then use that and require some
wire cutters and this also has a part to
strip the gauge of the wire once we cut
through so you'll need those two
separately if you don't have one tool
that does both this is what we do for
use in our testing environment to make
sure we're grounded properly before
rotating GPUs and things like that so it
is something that I trust a couple of
notes this is done entirely at your own
risk I can tell you how to do things you
should probably use a multimeter at the
end to check just for 100% certainty
that everything is good to use but don't
at your own risk because if you do it
improperly can definitely give you a
shock and this is just a normal power
cable we're using 115 volt outlets
because we're in the US and what you do
is you need to bend the two prongs on
the power cable you cut the the
receiving end of the cable that goes
into the computer and then as you can
see once we've cut through the receiving
end all that's done at this point is
stripping the gauge of the wire to
expose
the copper for the actual cable for our
power cable and any American power
cables that I'm familiar with you'll
want to expose only the green copper
underneath the housing so the black and
white which is what we have in this
cable are the two wires that we don't
want we want only the green and then you
strip the green housing off of the
copper to expose it and to strip the
housing you might have to as we did cut
into the housing slightly not all the
way through but maybe a quarter of the
way through and do that on each side and
then just pull it off with your hands
and the same is true for the black
housing on the cable itself once you've
exposed the copper wire inside of the
cable you should twist the ends of it so
that it remains intact through use and
with the two prongs bent and the single
fatter circular prong remaining that
effectively means that we are only
connected to ground through the outlet
the third prong means ground for safety
purposes you can cover up the other two
wires the black and white in our case
with electrical tape and if you wanted
to you can cover up the tube bent prawns
with electrical tape although if those
don't go in the outlet they won't draw
any power or current through them we
don't do this for our cabling we're
pretty confident that ours are safe but
for safety reasons if you want to it
won't hurt anything to cover those bits
up with electrical tape so you do not
want the smaller prawns connected that's
why we bend them if they snap when you
bend it cover the snapped part with
electrical tape just for safety to make
sure there's no current going through
they're received from the wall and then
before you work on your system whether
it's open air or in a an actual case
just tap the wire the copper bit at the
end that's exposed and that will ground
you definitively and obviously things
can happen you can still damage
components of latent ESD or other types
of ESD but this is a a much more sure
way to ground yourself before working on
it and if you want it to be even more
sure you can connect your ESD wrist
strap to that exposed part of the cable
and then wear that on your wrist and
that will keep you grounded throughout
the process of building so that is all
for this video check the channel for
more helpful videos like this and our
patreon page which is linked in the post
roll video if you're interested in
helping us make more of these again at
your own risk but this is what we do in
the lab it works really well for staying
grounded and keeping all the components
protected so I will see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
