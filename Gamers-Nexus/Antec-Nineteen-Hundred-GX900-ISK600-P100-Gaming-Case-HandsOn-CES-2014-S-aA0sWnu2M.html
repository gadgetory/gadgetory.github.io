Nexus Donna and I am joined by Justin
Chow we are here at antic suite for CES
2014 they have a couple cases that they
are unveiling here today including and I
will be roll this in a massive case that
I think you'll all be pretty interested
in let's start with the smallest though
first of all what's it called what are
the specs sure let me run it through you
guys by the way thank you so much Steven
really really excited to be here and so
this is our isk 600 this is personally
one of my favorite cases that we're
showing at this at this booth at this
suite so you're gonna see exterior it's
completely aluminum the faceplate is a
very nice matte black and this strip
right here is not just for show it's
actually a slight LED strip so it kind
of glows it tells you you know is your
hard drive working things like that and
so if I just open the cover here you'll
see that inside we have several goodies
for you guys you're gonna be able to fit
two 2.5 inch drivers you're gonna be
able to fit a slim DVD drive right here
we were just discussing whether or not
people still use DVD drives so if you're
interested you go ahead and comment
below comment let us know and so we've
actually included vibration dampers on
this it's not really caged but you can
put your 3.5 inch drives over here so
you get a 2 2.5 inch to 3.5 and then
another 3.5 on the side so you're gonna
get enough storage space for all your
movies and whatnot
and the best part about this case is the
fact that you can use the standard power
supply a lot of the times cases of this
form factor they're gonna incorporate
power supply in there for you so it
might not be 80 plus gold it might not
be the wattage you want
we've made it so that you can put in
which ever power supply you like and
finally we've included FDB fans on our
all of our new setups Steven asked me is
this a real FDB fan I said yes they are
real FDB fans that's a good part so
that's it for the is K 600 and we will
move on to the next case so right here
we have the P 100 which is a smaller
version of our Ord winning P 280 now the
B 280 is very well known for it's very
sleek very simple cover
you're gonna get two fans in the front
whether it can be either 120 fans or 140
fans you get a mesh filter in front to
5.25 drive bays in the front so you can
use your DVD drives your memory card
readers hard drives hard drive readers
if I take off the sight pound you'll
notice a couple things you'll notice
that on the side over here there's all
it's all sound dampening material so
every single section of this case is
built for silence whether it be this
panel is covered the top panel the front
panel the only panel that's not covered
is the rear panel because you have PCI
use and so you're gonna get plenty of
dry base to 5.25 on top as I mentioned
earlier and then you're gonna bet let's
see one two three four five six seven a
lot a lot enough that is the key and
you're gonna get a huge CPU cut out so
we're really excited about this case if
you're looking for a smaller form factor
its fits standard ATX and everything in
between
and you know it's built for silence and
we're very excited to be showing this
one so a very good mid-range case
finally this one reminds me a little bit
of the the GX 700 I already reviewed hit
the link below if you need that what are
the specs here so the GX 900 we were
just talking about it looks a little bit
like a punisher for me it looks like a
jeep let me know what you think and so
on top you're gonna get two you're gonna
get two fans on top and yet two fans in
the front as well and so you're gonna be
able to see one 40s on in the front one
40s on top you're also gonna get USB 3.0
fan controller on top power and reset
button what's really cool about this
case is how much space is in there so
the one thing I was telling Stephen is
there's nothing worse than knowing that
you just finished doing all your cable
routing and the side panels don't go on
so we made sure that you have enough
space there's over 1.5 inches of space
in the back you can literally stick your
entire hand back there and if the reason
we did that is by or the way we did that
is by punching it out it's just it makes
it a little bit wider without making the
case look super fat very cool and now
we're gonna move on to the 1900 yes I'm
excited for this one let's roll this way
so now we are at the 1900 it comes in in
both red and green accent options this
is this has a lot going on I didn't have
time to memorize it so I'll let you tell
us what's what's in here I don't knock
security I've never ice everything the
1900 is one of our most interesting
cases that we have available right now
it's gonna come standard out of the box
six fluid dynamic bearing fans three in
the front two on top one in the rear you
also have an additional option to add
two more right here to create a nice
wind tunnel effect or just pull the air
from the front all the way to the top
now you're gonna have three 5.25 drive
bays up here of course everything is to
lists you're also gonna get twelve drive
bays you can ask where's the twelve
drive bays they're actually down here so
what's really cool about this case is
the fact that you can put in two power
supplies so I don't know if you're gonna
do it it's a little crazy you could
potentially put in two thirteen hundred
watts the HDP 1300s and OC linked them
for 2600 watts that's kind of insane
just just watch your watch draw from the
actual outlet there because you might
exceed that yeah so just don't blow your
don't blow your pieces right now one
thing I want to tell you guys is how
much how much space is actually in the
back for a cable routing there's over is
over an inch so it'll reach everything a
lot of people have been asking when you
have two power supplies how are you
gonna reach the cable all the way up and
there's actually no problem so far I
built it myself I know that it works as
far as distancing one really cool thing
that I want to point out is not just the
dual color options you we have it in
green as well as red one really cool
thing that I noticed when I was just
deconstructing it was that every single
piece every single panel is a dual layer
the front has dual ear plastic the side
right here has mesh a sand dampening
foam over here on the side panels
there's actually 0.8 secc steel in
addition to that we have another layer
of plastic on both side panels so again
the only place that does not have
dampening sound dampening material is
the rear very cool and we have a MSRP
and release date on this everything that
you see in this suite today we wanted to
say and we're very proud to say you can
buy right now pretty much everything -
the GX 900 you can go ahead and buy
right now so we want to make sure when
you see these videos that they're ready
for you and right now the MS
RP is 269 and there will be some
promotions coming up so keep your eyes
peeled and we look forward to seeing
what your comments and feedbacks are
very cool so as always keep an eye out
for further review and thermal
benchmarks and yeah thanks again Justin
we will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
