discussion about remakes and things like
starcraft HD potentially if you like
brood war and the old game of starcraft
before two came out master of orion
talking about a.m. to our and pokemon
uranium before getting to that coverage
this is brought to you by I've a power
and their new element PC which has the
large tempered glass side panel window
that you're looking at now the first
item in game news for the week is Master
of Orion this is a game we covered at
PAX East earlier this year or gaming
dotnet announced the release date and
price of the forex franchises relaunch
following an extended early access time
with the company targeting a thirty
dollar launch price on August 25th this
year we've previously talked about some
of the new features to the master of
orion series with this release including
espionage economic victories and other
items we've detailed in our packs
coverage and then we also have talked
about the games all-star voice cast
which if you haven't heard by the way is
pretty impressive it includes Mark
Hamill recently also known to be working
on star citizen Alan Tudyk known for
firefly and John de Lancie Star Trek of
course Michael Dorn Star Trek and Nolan
North who seems to be in every video
game on the planet our next bit of news
moves us to the fan remakes of a.m. to
our first which is another metroid to
remake i got traction for the launch of
the metroid to remake for the pc and was
designed to bring the game to pc without
use of an emulator and update the
graphics to look and feel more like a
modern Metroid Indy type title as it
might be expected the remake hadn't been
online lawn before all the hosts for the
downloads and am to our proper receive
dmca notices from nintendo most of em to
our site is still available sends the
download and media pages and a new blog
post discussed Nintendo's actions so far
and to our has not received an official
cease and desist order and the creator
is still planning on updating the game
and fixing some of the bugs that players
have reported but whether or not those
will be publishable is yet to be seen in
other fan made that game
news Pokemon uranium has finally
released and the title features a
brand-new region and over 150 completely
custom-made Pokemon like the official
Nintendo titles this game has eight gems
in a new region called tandoor and the
game was made with RPG maker XP it uses
entirely custom Pokemon in an attempt to
bypass the same issue that am to are
faced with CMDs and things like that
though it's still using the Pokemon name
so we'll see how that works out and
there are rumors of yet another update
on an old title this time however it's
supposedly being made by the original
publishers according to Korean news
outlet I news24 Blizzard is going to
reveal Starcraft HD this year either at
blizzcon in November or at the starcraft
2 World Championship in September
according to I news24 the source of this
rumor is someone with quote knowledge of
blizzards internal plans really no way
to validate that and again according to
that rumor the gameplay will be the same
but with updated graphics and a better
UI is similar to pretty much every other
HD remake we've seen recently including
those for age of empires and age of
mythology and anything else you can
think of in that genre the last bit of
game news today comes from Nvidia the
company announced that they plan to
leverage the resources to support indie
game developers with their indie
spotlight and videos going to begin
packing indie game developers with their
hardware the same way they do with
triple-a games and have done for years
now in addition to this there including
indie titles on an nvidia now game
streaming service which is available on
the shield and maybe elsewhere in the
future and the titles will be supported
on social media the implementation of
this plan by major company in the gaming
space shows another sign of how indie
games have grown in recent years and we
also saw this with coolermaster packs at
least maybe a year ago where they were
showcasing a bunch of indie games in
their booth so there's definitely some
real hardware support for the indie
development community now and it's a
good time just looking at the current
titles out there starting value as one
example of a successful title so that's
