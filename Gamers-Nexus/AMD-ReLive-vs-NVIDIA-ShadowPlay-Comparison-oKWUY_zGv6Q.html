gaming evolved integration the incumbent
utility that dismayed us on a number of
occasions today with the AMD relive
updates to the Crimson brand drivers and
these implemented its own solution to
software capture for gameplay and
retroactive gameplay capture this is a
direct competitor to the shadow play
software from Nvidia's GeForce
experience suite and performs many of
the same functions and has the same end
objective years ago we did this
comparison with shadow play versus fraps
versus GVR which is and these previous
utility before it was subsumed by raptor
and the gaming evolves platform and
we're back now that there's a new tool
again we live under an these latest
Crimson brand update and this tool we
have side-by-side comparisons for we've
also got some benchmarks of the
framerate impact from doing live capture
with shadow play and with the new relive
tool and then finally we have some
storage capacity requirement benchmarks
between the two to look at the per
minute data consumption of each software
solution and these announcements for
today contain a whole lot more than just
the relive update but that's all we're
focusing on here because really it
deserves the most direct focus check
back tomorrow for more analysis and
discussion of oak at the overlay and
benchmarking tool that couples with
presentment and for discussion on other
tools within the AMD suite like an
update to the chill platform but again
today's focuses on relive let's start
with walkthrough the interface which
should be immediately apparent that the
utility is in fact capable of desktop
capture Andy is using an overlay similar
to shadow play for capture of
screenshots and video relying on even
the very same hotkey that shadow play
uses alt Z by default though that's
changeable the hotkey pops up the
overlay through which you can easily
modify capture settings toggle capture
without a hotkey
or begin retroactive gameplay capture
and broadcast and the relive at solution
plugs into twitch directly as well so
that offers customizable streaming
settings for the platform onto which you
may be streaming your gameplay in many
ways this is similar to shadow play
identical really and we've highlighted a
few of the key differences between the
quality settings and other options in
the interface in this quick table map
so I'm supported bitrate is where we're
starting this was checked using an rx
480 gaming X for the relive option and
shadowplay was checked with a GTX 960
gaming X because we figured those cards
would be the best for creating scenarios
where will later see any potential
performance loss and better represent
the current end-user market with
shadowplay were able to output a level
of quality that rapidly enters into sort
of placebo territory maxing out at 130
megabit per second data rates and again
that is limited primarily by your upload
platform like YouTube GFE used to be
limited to around 50 megabits per second
depending on how you configured it
previously but that's been expanded
Reliv seems to max out at about 50
megabits per second again and that's at
least with this card the RX 480 it uses
similar low medium high quality presets
to shadowplay but with different tuning
for the bitrate and for convenience
we've listed the data rate for each
preset in this table for each device or
software though it's not an indicator
which is better just the preset encoders
for Reliv can be switched between ABC
and HEV see while nvidia uses its own
encoding solution both relive and
shadowplay our hardware accelerated
encoders with designated GPU components
responsible for handling all that
encoding on the card this moves the
workload off of the CPU and is something
that was really emphasized in our
original video on shadowplay because
it's critical to performance and
retaining that performance while
capturing video moving down the list
we've got a default audio bitrate of
about 184 kilobits per second when
captured with shadowplay without options
for customization so that's a fixed data
rate and it was inspected when we looked
at the files and he gets points here as
the tool allows customization of bit
rates up to 320 kilobits per second for
the audio there's minimal Delta between
the higher bitrate audio captures when
using Reliv in terms of the file size so
running with higher audio bitrate isn't
really going to impact your performance
in an exponentially negative fashion
both tools enable custom audio input
device selection and choice between
push-to-talk are always on microphones
and in-game audio recording and as a few
interesting side points Reliv has
multiple overlay options when recording
so one of them is overlaying your own
image on the captured screen or game or
what
ever and that could be something like a
watermark so this is a pretty simple
feature that I'm actually happy to see
as content creators because this means
if you were a gaming channel and you
wanted zero editing involved in terms of
post process stuff like that and you
just want to record your game and upload
it this will allow you to still
watermark that footage to make sure
you've got your branding on there and
that it's not easily lifted so that's
added in relive and they've also gotten
overlay that's just kind of interesting
but not necessarily that functional and
in the bottom-right or whatever corner
you select there's a little slide out
when you start recording that list the
system information that so that'd be the
CPU and the GPU basically if you wanted
that present in your video so it's not
quite as advanced as something like
xsplit or OBS but it's also not trying
to be for example there's no way to do
scenes or overlaying multiple of your
own images and graphics with relive or
with shadow play it's pretty basic
you've basically got webcam overlays and
then the other options that I just
listed let's get into the benchmarks
between the two first here's a
side-by-side captured comparison of an
identically executed benchmark scenario
both captures were at 50 megabits per
second despite being able to go higher
on shadow play and they had roughly the
same audio bitrate though shadow play
was slightly lower
video playback basically looks the same
it's really up to you to compare that
though and granted YouTube will compress
this a bit but it should look about the
same because they're both using Hardware
encoders and they're both capturing at
the same bitrate when we look at the
file size comparison per minute of the
capture this chart is what we end up
with for reference our old data from
fraps benchmarking is also present here
since that software hasn't changed in
years or even been updated and we're
looking at file sizes of nearly 5
gigabytes with fraps for one minute of
recording or about 4,700 megabytes which
records effectively losslessly and
without GPU acceleration that's a bit
rate somewhere in the range of 638
megabytes per second weigh in to placebo
territory and that's assuming no
compression plays which with fraps there
probably are none shadowplay the newest
version anyway is capturing at about 366
megabytes for the entire one-minute run
and Reliv is capturing at about 370 6
megabytes with the same pass that's a 10
megabyte difference and this is a
repeated benchmark so we know that the
data is about the same for each pass
though we do have a
bit rate difference in audio that we
can't control for regardless relive and
shadowplay are effectively identical in
storage requirements and should it
really be a heavy point between the two
of them next we'll be looking at the
impact on gaming performance when using
either shadow play or relive this is to
say an analysis of the framerate loss
when using either tool because the way
these work you're inherently going to
have some loss now that could be i/o
bound it could be in the software side
it could be GPU or CPU bound it really
depends on the solution you're using it
with fraps given that bitrate obviously
you run into a storage bottleneck pretty
quickly it's way faster than what most
hard drives can reasonably handle and
fraps also doesn't really do GPU
acceleration at least not like these do
where you rely on individual
custom-designed encoders on either AMD
Hardware or Nvidia Hardware to perform
your encoding of the live captured video
so both of those solutions for these two
cards natively will be far better than
what something like fraps can do but OBS
things like that do have integrations
with encoders that work with hardware
we're just not looking at them today so
as stated the full testing methodology
is defined it for this in the article
below if you're curious about what
hardware was used or how we tested a
particular game or captured the gameplay
starting with dirt rally at 1440p with
ultra settings using an RX 480 gaming x4
AMD or gtx 1060 gaming x4 nvidia these
are the results were seen note first
that this is all relative performance
scaling since raw FPS means nothing to
us given the difference in video cards
used for testing the GTX 1060 using
shadow play is losing approximately ten
point nine percent of its performance
with dirt rally when capturing gameplay
and that means it's moving from 98 FPS
average to 87 point 3 FPS average and
with compare ibly reduced 1% in 0.1%
lows the RX for 80 using Reliv is losing
approximately 3.9 percent of its
performance with the game and the same
capture settings or a shift from about
eighty six point seven to 83.3 FPS
average and note here that the
performance on and video with shadow
play is a bit worse than what we see in
other games for example moving on to GTA
5 we see that shadow play is now
performing better than relive and also
obviously better than it did in dirt
this is certainly something we saw
previously in our lab
set of tests fraps and GB are and in
those tests gbr was doing worse in some
games than in others and a lot of that
varies based on how a particular game
interacts with the overlay provided by
the vendor so it's not necessarily a
hardware level thing anyway the
performance differences peg shadowplay
and the gtx 1060 at a performance loss
of 3.3 2% moving from ninety nine point
three to 96 FPS average basically
negligible and the arch 480 with Reliv
loses three point six five percent of
its performance I moved from 93 to 87
FPS average and this is all really good
news it didn't used to be the case that
you could use these hardware accelerated
software solutions for recording desktop
or gameplay footage and you had to rely
on things like fraps which was either
well both CPU intensive and storage
intensive in ways that would have your
frame rate sometimes depend BER you had
underline so that is where we're moving
and where we've been moving for a while
it's all going towards GPU acceleration
it makes a lot of sense that's what
these are built for and they have
individual components as I said for the
encoding process of the video so you do
always lose some performance that's the
nature of this it's just a matter of how
bad it is and with both of these tools
it's really negligible it's not that bad
at all now dirt was an interesting
scenario where we saw a worse
performance with the 10 60 and
shadowplay but that's not reflected in
every game and the same will be true for
this if we expand its test scenarios
again depends on how the software the
game interacts with the overlay the
biggest takeaway here is that where
shadow play was already really good at
what it does Andy now has a competitor
in the form of relives so you don't need
to rely on third-party solutions like
OBS and xsplit to get the same
functionality that Nvidia offers
natively now both vendors offer native
gameplay and desktop capture solutions
again a good thing and both of the tools
are low overhead so you're not losing
too many frames again dirt rally a bit
of an outlier here but not losing a lot
of frames either way and then in terms
of storage you're not really consuming
much of that either 300 something
megabytes or less in some cases
depending on what you're capturing for
about a minute of footage really not
something to complain about especially
when we look at where we came from which
would be
raps at 4 gigabytes per minute so that's
good news overall the compression is
good and not that lossy you obviously
lose some of the data you always do or I
should say you lose some of the quality
of that data but it's not bad and
YouTube will compress it more anyway so
if that's your end goal who cares
both perform well they produce about the
same visual quality now it's just no
longer really a point of comparison if
you're considering buying a card that's
something you can mark off the list
because they both have a solution that's
similar so we're happy that Andy finally
has its own software solution for this
task because that was kind of a driving
reason to get an Nvidia card if you
wanted really easy to use software
capture for whatever you're doing and
now they're level on that playing field
and in the future we'll be looking at
okat which is basically an interface
that Andy built for the open source
present amount projects which is what we
use for dx12 and vulcan testing it's an
important thing to have but it's not
easy to use it's all command line driven
so we'll talk about that probably
