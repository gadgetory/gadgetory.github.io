recap we're gonna talk about the last
week in hardware with an initial note on
some coffee like follow-ups so when I
did the review we talked about how we
didn't really know what the pricing and
availability would be yet because
reviews are obviously films before the
thing goes up for sale so now we know we
can talk about that a little bit I've
got some news on t 370 motherboards in
o3d has a 768 cuda cores GTX 1060 that's
kind of interesting
it's normally 1280 CUDA cores for
reference and then some other industry
news like the death of a hotel instant
messenger before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below so let's start with a
note on thermal testing and coffee like
we had thermals for coffee like lidded
and deleted and one of the things I've
seen online is people citing different
thermal numbers from different review
outlets hours and minuses and so forth
where one outlet like Linus I think got
in the 90s 90 92 degrees Celsius and
some of ours were era they're anywhere
from 60 something to 70 mid to high 70s
depending on what test the part that I
want to pick a bone with here is that
some of the Comets I've seen online
today that we filmless the day of coffee
lake release have been things like Linus
got 92 degrees Celsius where gamers
Nexus got 68 degrees Celsius that's not
really how it works
well like you can't just say it's not a
score it's not like a fire strike score
it's not a number that's assigned to you
based on some one click benchmark if
thermal as I'm sure all of you know
depend on basically everything what
frequency was used what molded was used
what motherboard was used we published a
whole video on just motherboard with
different Auto settings can impact the
temperature but more importantly what
cooler was used and I'm not sure what
every
reviewer uses four coolers I don't
really check but we used a crack in X 62
with max pump and fan speeds that's what
we always do for these thermal tests
just because it's we know it'll
accommodate everything for the most part
and that means it's easier to check
scaling because what you don't want in
our situation is to encounter a CPU that
runs hot enough where your standard
means of benchmarking in terms of
coolers is not adequate because if that
happens then you lose all that
comparative data so we don't like that
we use an X 62 I don't know what Linus
used I don't know what anyone else used
but the point is that all the numbers
can be correct
it's just how did they test it and even
workload matters so testing in prime95
28 point five or twenty nine point two
versus twenty six point six that alone
can have massive differences because
your ABX workload versus non AVX
workload produces a different amount of
heat you start doing things like hyper
threading on CPUs and now you're
spinning off more ABX threads per core
and so your heats gonna be higher per
core whereas something with no hyper
threading would be lower temperature in
that instance because it's doing 180 X
thread per core instead of two or
something like that so application
matters all that stuff matters so the
point being that when when quoting
temperature numbers online please try
and keep the parameters somewhat in the
quote because seeing things like line of
Scott ninety degrees Celsius or gamers
axis got 68 degrees Celsius drives me a
little bit crazy because it means
absolutely nothing if I put it under
liquid nitrogen and benchmarked it and
said that we got negative 100 degrees
like it does is that still a valid
number to share does that mean coffee
like has phenomenal cooling because
realistically of course the answer is
well if it's under a different cooling
element then it's going to perform
differently from what other people see
that's all I wanted to say about that
but another quick note so
going through some of the charts and
stuff we noticed that in our coffee like
temperature numbers for the blender 4.9
gigahertz overclocked with I think a 1.4
v ID or peak or rather one point 4 volts
4.9 gigahertz in blender the data
referenced was in the incorrect column
so the correction to that is one we'll
put on the screen now the difference is
4 degrees Celsius so sorry instead of 24
degrees Celsius cooler with liquid metal
it's actually only 20 degrees Celsius
cooler so of course that completely
changes everything except not at all
because it's still 20 degrees Celsius
cooler with liquid metal and actually on
that note so I did some more looking
into this the we show that Intel still
uses Tim obviously as evidence PI at 20
see difference in this particular
heavily overclocked test 20 see
difference going to liquid metal where's
Tim they're still using Tim I'm not 100%
sure if it's the same Dow Corning's
stuff as always or if it's slightly
better one thing I do know is that the
die size is larger on coffee lake on the
8700 k and that means you're spreading
the heat out over a larger area now of
course it accommodates two more cores so
that die size isn't wasted but it's
still larger and that plus a
questionable change in thermal take in
thermal tea and thermal paste
questionable meaning I'm not sure if
they did those two things together would
account for the the slightly better
thermal performance in the 8700 k than
we saw in the 7700 k that i talked about
in the review where basically it seems
like it's just at least marginally
better and they're bauer and i thought
maybe there was a change in thermal
compound where maybe they're using the
hcc stuff that they use on i-9s on 8700
k but we're not really neither of us is
really sure about that or at least I'm
not maybe he is by now but he wasn't
yesterday so that's all for the the
coffee like stuff basically temperature
comparisons can't be done cross site or
even inter site if they use different
coolers and things and and the number 20
20 degrees Celsius difference inside of
24
still worth doing liquid metal one more
thing I guess I saw a couple quotes
online where people were kind of I was
talking with Patrick about this as well
who works on a lot of our testing and
we've seen some quotes online where
people will take like data from deleting
or like noctua versus other tests things
like that and use it as a bludgeon to
hit people over the head with and one of
the things I've seen recently was
deleting numbers for the 8700 K being
used to say you need to deal with the
8700 K for it to be any good thermally
no you absolutely do not in fact it
actually cools pretty well comparatively
and deleting it really helps obviously
we would recommend it for really heavy
overclocks even just getting rid of some
of the silicon adhesive and replacing it
with better Tim you'll be in pretty good
shape doing that and we're going liquid
metal you get our twenty degree Celsius
reductions and that helps in a few ways
you get about a four percent power
reduction for every 10 degree Celsius
reduction in temperature and our 20 C
versus a 10 to 20 watt reduction and
power leakage scales with that model
exceptionally well so that's a reason to
deal it and do liquid metal heavy
overclocks our reason 1.4 plus volts
that's a reason if you start running
higher power
it's also worth deleting and doing
liquid metal because if noise is really
important to you you can use lower rpm
fans to achieve the same cooling I with
a 20 degree advantage and an overclocked
test it's not always 20 C to be clear
this goes back to like you can't just
say the number and call it a day not
always 20 degrees all these it was 20
degrees Celsius in that test four point
nine gigahertz one point four volts in
blender and if that's the kind of
workload you do doing liquid metal means
you can use a cheaper cooler a lower rpm
cooler or something in between and end
up better off overall but you absolutely
do not need to deal it to have a
thermally sound 8700 K it's actually
quite good but that doesn't mean you
can't improve it so just kind of get
that stuff out there next topic on the
coffee Lake CPUs pricing and
availability micro Center
I've got a I've got a bone to pick with
Micro Center now what the heck $500 the
8700 K every micro Center we we put out
a tweet saying what's the pricing and
availability of the 8700 K in your
region got dozens of replies from all of
you thank you and every micro Center
screen shot I got $500 apparently it
worked just fine cuz they sold out of
them but man that is awful this is like
there's this like Intel Intel is kind of
in the Vega bucket right now we're
pricing is insane and availability is
nil and who's to blame for it it's
probably a mix of retailers distributors
suppliers and Intel just like a.m. these
issues are a mix of AMD distributors
suppliers and and retailers I guess so
yeah basically we dug into this a bit so
I don't know how many units were
available I don't know if it was just
like this thing was tremendously desired
and so sold out immediately or if it was
genuinely Lois stock everything I've
heard from the industry is low stock
part of the leak we got a couple of
about a week or two ago when we
published that leak of the the h-series
300 motherboards coming out quarter one
next year
that was sent to me part of that I got
information from a supplier we're a very
small percentage I'm like let's let's
just go with well yeah 10% basically so
10% of all CPUs going into the country
that originated that email to me 10% of
their CPUs it was a non-us country we're
going to be eighth generation coffee
like CPUs in quarter four so meaning 90%
our KB Lakes kylieqq whatever's left and
we also heard that allocation was pretty
small and some retailers and some
suppliers were only allowing coffee like
sales with the rest of a system sort of
like an SI deal where you you see it
with Vega to where you get you might be
able to get the part
easily more easily by going through it
with someone like iBUYPOWER CyberPower
or one of them because there's more
allocation to them as opposed to
stand-alone part sales so available that
he's definitely not great but I don't
know how bad it is or if it's just
genuine super-high interest what we do
know is the pricing Newegg had it for
about $20 over the 1k unit pricing which
was I think 3 350s 360 something like
that
so Newegg was selling at the 370 380
range and a $20 uptick on 1k you pricing
is not unreasonable that's pretty normal
actually so there Bryson was fine but
they're out of stock Amazon has some
high fives in stock they didn't have
8700 K s when I checked but they sold
out of everything by now for sure and
generally pricing was plus or minus a
hundred dollars globally from the US
$370 price ignoring micro centers
absolutely absurd pricing but yeah so
pricing seems more or less okay within
what you normally see I if some of you
have absolutely outrageous prices in
your region let me know below obviously
I can't keep an eye on every region but
from what I've seen it's more or less ok
it's just there's no availability and oh
this might be of interest I called the
few retailers posing as a customer
including Micro Center a couple micro
Center locations around the US and all
of them told me to expect inventory in
about two weeks
Newegg told me a window of two to four
weeks and obviously they think they're
talking to a customer here so they're
gonna say more but I emailed Intel as
well and asked about available at in
pricing and Intel provided the following
quote on your question the eighth
generation Intel Core desktop processors
and systems are on sale globally we are
actively working with our retailers to
fulfill a strong interest from customers
on the Intel Core i7 8700 KS q so
absolutely nothing of use which is
basically every statement I ever get out
of Intel yes
it's some of the people that are great
to work with but when it comes to
getting a statement it's always as
tight-lipped as possible so that
statement is exceptionally useless
basically they're saying
we're trying to sell the products we
just made so a big surprise let's move
on to the next topic
the next topic vendors are readying Z
370 motherboards EVGA is on the list
they have the Z 370 classified K Z 370
ftwe 370 micro and as for evey J's
boards the FTW and micro boards are both
ten plus one phase designs neither has a
RGB and the classified K has an RGB it's
also got a killer NIC and it has a 12
plus one phase V RM so that's the
difference there the FTW is $1.99 or
$200 MSRP and to be determined on the
other two for differences between the
FTW and classified K other than the vrm
we can kind of toggle between the images
and it's basically playing the game of
spot the difference there aren't many
but the classified K does have an extra
four pin power header and some other
small changes across the board other
than these asrock issues and gigabyte
have also all of course shown or
released their boards at this point the
reason for 300 series chipsets as we
published previously is that they have a
different power delivery subsystem for
the high core count chips and just for a
coffee like in general because I mean
they're different they have different
needs to date asrock issues gigabyte MSI
and biostar have all outed some of their
z3 sony motherboard offerings and we can
kind of go through the pictures here but
for the most part they're not there's
not too much we can talk about yet until
we can actually see the VRMs of these
things or remove some of the heat sinks
and look at them the next news item is
from no.3 D no.3 D has a new headless
video card they're trying to release
which headless means in this context
that there's no display out on it so
they are looking at doing headless gtx
1060 s no display out they're gonna have
GP 106 the GPU but it's modified it has
the same 192 bit memory bus however it's
going down to 768 CUDA cores from 1280 s
that's actually really interesting to me
and I'm not sure what like where they're
getting the the GPUs I don't know if
it's like they can buy these GPUs from
Nvidia that have more or less been
thrown in the trash bin that have
functional memory bosses but
half their cores are not working if
that's the case they should be cheaper
but otherwise basically they're
targeting miners who want the memory
bandwidth don't care about the cores can
run a 75 watt TDP instead of whatever
the original was a bit higher for sure
and then get rid of display outs and
reduce cost overall so that's really
pretty interesting but it's not really
my market so we'll see I'm most curious
about how they get the GPUs the chips
and if they're actually cheaper from
Nvidia that way or if they're buying
proper GP 106 is and then that's
disabling stuff which doesn't seem like
it make a lot of sense next one is some
industry stuff say USB i f published
their USB 3.2 type C specs recently
that's targeting a 20 gigabit per second
bandwidth and it was originally
announced back in July the USB
implementers forum now published the
newest version of the USB specification
3.2 will double the bandwidth of USB 3.1
gen2 for a maximum bandwidth of 20
gigabits per second or 2.5 gigabytes per
second the new USB 3.2 hosts and devices
will use a multi-lane operation using
existing certified 10 gigabit per second
type C cables to achieve the new speeds
and in product news coolermaster is
debuting a new budget family of power
supplies in the mwe series these new
supplies will offer capacities from 450
to 650 watts with five models in total
all models are 80 plus bronze certified
and non-modular the PSU is adhere to the
ATX form factor have a 100,000 hour mtbf
minimum and offer over voltage over
power over temperature over current and
short circuit protections the price
range is 50 to 70 dollars finally
SteelSeries has a new keyboard the apex
150 that's aimed at those who like
membrane keyboards and want to be able
to spill coffee on them the apex 150 has
water resistance and two drainage
cavities built into it so they've gone a
bit hardcore with that apex 150 uses
SteelSeries proprietary quick tension
system to deliver membrane switches that
are rated for 20 million key presses and
deliver a quick actuation and tactile
feel the apex 150 also has 24 key role
over RGB lighting and discord
integration whatever that means
apex 150 should be a
fifty dollars sometime in October and
then finally a while Instant Messenger
is dead
so that's sad I guess it was it was
truly pretty revolutionary back when it
came out but yeah that one's gone other
news star citizen has a 3.0 alpha out
for the evocati at this point so the the
very early beta testers now have access
to 3.0 alpha I'm sure a lot of you at
this point have no idea we've ever
covered star citizen for probably since
about 2012 we've been covering it
originally in articles only we have a
whole playlist on the channel with
probably like 40 videos in it almost all
of which are interviews with different
people at the company and we've been
covering it over the years it's gotten a
lot less coverage this year because it's
basically impossible to get a hold of
Chris at this point Chris Roberts or
anyone else because they've had their
heads down working on the game so you've
heard about 3.0 alpha a bit now if you
watched our previous reviews or
interviews rather which were at
citizencon and it looks like it's
finally rolling out to early beta
testers so we're alpha testers in this
case so yeah I don't know we'll try and
follow it it's it's kind of hit a slow
down lately but once there's something
more substantial to do with star citizen
and we'll be doing it hopefully
benchmarking that's all for now you get
a patreon.com slash gamers Nexus to help
us out directly as always or you can get
a story that gamers Nexus not net to
pick my shirt like this one we also have
hats now or we'll have them back in
stock soon there were only four or five
originally got more made so there's a
leave back on the store and subscribe
for more I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
