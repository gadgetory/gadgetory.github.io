back it might be back okay yeah the
extreme computer crashed but it still is
it frozen no okay it's not frozen
okay ma'am of all the things to crash
you actually the stream computer didn't
crash OBS just straight froze I don't
know what was going on okay let me tweet
out louder how we're back it wasn't even
the overclocking machine that's in a
bucket of ice the streaming computer
it's supposed to be stable stream is
back up stream at PC had an issue with
OBS sorry about that check the link here
okay so we're back man that was a huge
pain I think I lost a chat record of a
super chat stew sorry guys
okay anyway what a pain so we lost like
everyone of tile like 1400 viewers from
over 4000 all right guys let everyone
know we're back I guess the issue with
the so someone says 360p yeah if you're
seen in 360p refresh or check the bottom
right and manually set it to 1080 that's
a bug where when it crashes it'll it'll
do something it'll do that okay all
right let me just tweet one more time
stream is a back sorry about stream PC
crash okay alright so everyone should be
aware again that we're coming back sorry
about that
alright let's get going okay I think I I
think it killed the record of super chat
stew it's a huge pain but I'll look
through I'll see what I can do okay so
we're just gonna go back to this
straight away we had some kind of crash
I think it was from it was in GT one I
think so that means it was a memory
likely memory issue so we're gonna step
down the memory clock a bit because
apparently that was too ambitious you'll
know it work previously so let's just go
down to 1180
and get it to pass something and then
we'll go from there so I need this to be
I'm gonna check chat in a moment to see
what everyone's saying I need this to be
165 1180 that's good
so that will be our profile 7 and then
we'll do 175 and 1180 that'll be profile
for now we're gonna do 1161 65 that's
profile 6 and I'm gonna read chat after
I set all these and then we need one
that's 11:30 and 140 and that will be
profile 1 ok all right so man what a
pain to drop the stream like that that
sucks
let's let's get this going again time
spy profile 9 start okay then we'll
boost it let me check chat yeah sorry
guys all right so we're running again
it's a damn damn stream machine we're
actually on different circuits - I'm
running the stream PC to a different
different circuit in my office to make
sure we didn't draw too much power for
one trip the breaker so it wasn't that
but that was of course I first thought
while we're working here okay so yeah
got a good amount of people back let
everyone know we're back streaming again
if if you know people who are watching
and thought it dropped ok
so super chats datafile 5 bucks that's
the analogy I made for my dad and his
friends it's the nerd version of drag
racing which I love talking about
systems yeah I didn't hit the right
profile so that scores gonna be low
because I'm not used to having to like
micro my benchmarks so I normally just
read super Jets whatever score will be a
little lower than it should be ok let's
get back to super Jets then deal 5 bucks
I knew this overclocking stuff reason
why am I asking this question why aren't
AMD CPUs used for this type of
overclocking and these CPUs are
perfectly fine of course actually
extremely competitive and good in the r5
class especially these days but for this
type of overclocking specifically with
3d mark x pi it really likes frequency
and I like scores so getting both of
those is difficult even Intel of course
who has a frequency advantage has a
pretty hard time doing that so the
reason
is we don't use them four times by
because times pi really likes to have
the frequency and and these CPUs just
can't get there even though they're
completely just they're too good they're
fine for game and stuff like that it
does not mean they're not good for
gaming or anything it just means that
for this particular type of benchmark
the Intel high NCP's are advantaged so
that's why we do that I got to hit some
hotkeys for this one so I'm gonna try
and keep it an eye on chat and hit the
hotkeys all right so we got a Tim Howell
2 box thank you very much Tim for that
ob has decided to hit the hotkeys F and
you are absolutely right OBS gave us a
big fu and if it happens again we'll
come back I hope it doesn't I don't know
what's going on with the stream PC
hopefully it does not freeze but we'll
see we'll see it's not even in a bucket
of ice so it shouldn't be freezing but
uh let's let's get this okay so next
sake I'm boosting 10 megahertz on the
core right now and keeping memory at 11
80 megahertz offsets low we should be
able to 12:40 but we were freezing so
let's just let's look at some times I
just want to get a benchmark done before
we you know try to push it all the way
just cuz you want some base numbers so
there's the artifact and I was talking
about that specifically if you don't
know is called memory artifacting if you
see flickering with multicolored lines
like that but you're still getting all
of your geometry your meshes your
textures the scene is clearly the same
so this is a memory artifact where the
memory is running probably a bit higher
than where it's perfectly stable it
could be a strap issue you can just be
timings and I'm dropping the memory
clock now so it will survive because
this part hopefully it'll survive
shouldn't speak too soon yeah that just
dropped a lot of frames like this will
drop score so what happens is in that
last scene right there it's loading a
ton of geometry and particles from
everything on the ground floor so when
you're not on the ground floor in this
time supply benchmark and you're kind of
shooting over the balcony it will be
less intensive so the the current
requirement is lower than when we are in
that ground floor looking at all the
geometry and the display cases and stuff
so something going on or what
mm-hmm Oh why'd you print it then this
cuz I can't load the site 8360 thank you
thank you oh yeah yeah okay that's what
I was asking for earlier so this just in
I guess done a new show now hahaha
so Linus's score final because i
couldn't load 3dmark earlier it's 8360
as I said which is beatable for sure
their graphics cores 8001 and their CPUs
11,000 to 21 so we're we're about 1200
points I had in CPU and I just need this
thing to survive I don't know what's
going on with it
the cards are unhappy today how does the
reservoir championship
three point six so we should be it
should be fine
that's uh we could always switch to the
ACS card maybe that one's that one might
be more stable actually now let me give
this one one more shot then I'll switch
to the ACS card if it crashes because
all I have to do is toggle which slot is
active and that's doable on this this
EVGA dart board pretty easily so alright
11:6 you gotta type all this in again I
want to keep five and we might even want
to bring this down even lower for for
that final scene if it's gonna have
memory crashes like that last one so I'm
gonna bring it down a little lower even
though I really don't want to because I
know it should be able to survive it did
for the dual card then alright so 135
111 60 let's do a 165 and like I think
1130 it's a big drop but I think about
140 just straight crashes but 1130 seems
to be a strap so we'll do that for
profile three and then let's do 1180 I
guess even a 12 2012 14 should be stable
a lot but if I get a stable I'm not
doing the voltage on the power
yeah well up but after I get a stable
1180 170 okay
and then we need a 11 60 or 11:30 and
140 all right I'll check super chats in
a second so like I said if you buy stuff
during the stream that's what really
helps us out with live stream because
these obviously this whole setup takes
forever and it's not even fully
functional apparently because it froze
so if you want to help us out you can
grab something on stored I camera's
Nexus tonight I'll try and shout out the
purchases while we go live today and I
need to re-up some of those profiles to
have the correct voltage and power
offsets one okay apply so we're gonna
get a profile one forget their profile
three that is not good that needs to be
up so the placebo slider actually seems
to maybe do something here profile for
needs to be up on the power target and
the Festiva slider profile six up oh
okay okay I'm not saving it again am i
okay six and then four and then we have
a couple more and then we're gonna
launch again and see if it will work
this time hopefully three okay three and
then profile one okay we're good there
so one three is what I'm dropping
through for the last scene four is when
I'm dropping or I'm boosting to before
that six good seven is good actually it
six needs to be yep six is good seven
needs to be higher here so there's seven
and then eight is good but low and nine
is good okay let's do it one more time
hopefully it works this time pressures
on when it randomly decides to not go as
smoothly as it was the previous three
days who knows hardware is getting a bit
beat up now I probably should actually
boost that CPU vcore just because I
don't know if it's if it's having issues
there but like previous class crash was
clearly memory and this can be valuable
to learn anyway if you do if you're
interested in this stuff you can grab
3dmark we like their software they're
not an advertiser or anything like that
in fact it's the opposite they just they
just give us the Psalter and we use it
we barely even mentioned them but if you
like it it's free but what you can know
what's useful to know is the crash we
just had where it was all artifacting
and flickering and then froze that was a
memory crash on the GPUs so that means
if you're trying to figure out what's
too high you know a dial it back in that
instance it would be the GPU memory and
then if you're not getting a memory
artifact and just straight crashes it's
probably core maybe CPU but Seaview
times the crash and the CPU test okay so
like I said we lost some of the super
chat messages I think when it crashed
sorry about that I don't know how to get
them back but I will I'll keep an eye on
it if there's a way to super chat from
xes two bucks we thought you'd
electrocuted yourself oh by like sinking
my hand in the water no we're good thank
you though
issues Canadian $4 na production law
okay
jaegun 12 $4.99 you should add nitrous
directly to the CPU to make it go faster
is this going back to the drift the hid
the drag racing car analogy we're going
to profile 7 now Cory bought her $5 says
I wonder if the 32 quarter TR 2 would be
able to compete with Sony 1980 XE you
know the clock is lower not in times by
extreme that's why you don't see them
all the top I actually haven't run it we
have one here on loan but I have not run
times by with that with that CPU so I
don't know where it lands obviously
spent on is out there but it definitely
competes in things that aren't times 5
extreme like and you know what you'd use
it for production and a blender or
something all right so we're gonna boost
to the clocks we're not artifacting this
time what's good can you see any of the
screen or now in this a little bit okay
so anyway we're looking good right now
this is where we died last time so let's
see if we can push past here I don't
know what take my hand off a keyword and
turn the probe on but we'll wait wait
till we get through this part so here's
where two artifacts and pretty much all
those top scores are gonna have
artifacting as long as it's drawing all
the geometry which it is looks a lot
better so far this time it's gonna start
freaking out in a minute once it gets to
the display case and so this is all
based on the current load if you put a
current clamp on the 12 volt cables hang
on sec let's drop that okay okay we're
dropped a bit please survive I didn't
drop all the way down got a bit greedy
but apparently the greed paid off okay
we've survived now I'm gonna drop the
GPU down into its easiest possible
setting actually that's not true
but into a very easy setting just so we
can only worry about the CPU and if this
isn't stable it's gonna be a V core
thing I need to boost it by about 100
millivolts okay oh hey - donated 8360
hello friend it says thank you lioness
for the 83 Canadian dollars Wow we got
an overcurrent protection
what is going on I might need a second
power supply or something over current
protection on that one maybe more
voltage is not what we need so you might
need a second power supply but we have
in the last few days so we'll see
all right so 8360 though I think that's
that is in fact their scores thank you
lioness for sending a super chat so I
can have it pinned there to the top you
know I'm gonna switch GPUs I think I'd
have to reinstall drivers let's wait I
think I might have to reinstall drivers
to switch GPUs let's just let's just
tone everything down and get it to run
profiles what do I have here 15:42 is
good for sure so that's what God has
1542 points and let's leave that there
but let's just drop this 250 it's fine
come back to it later really want one
score submitted first and oh that
increased some of our timings as well so
that should loosen those up a bit but
that was definitely no CP okay you just
want the GP as well yes I am going to
try and wait a little bit because I
think if I switch the GP that's active
it will it will probably need a driver
wipe and install and that time I don't
really want to spend on it right now
all right so anyway we're booting up we
got a couple stupid shots here
Corie Vata I've got yours data file
Linus posted it we broke the wrong
record nice yeah so if you missed it
Linus is posting single card scores I
don't think Linus if you're watching you
guys ever get a nun be linked in or
bridge in so I think they didn't have
one when they posted that but that's
fine it's still still a good place to
compete so it crashed in the CPU this
time which is probably OCP which is very
annoying so 111 81 165 for that type all
these numbers and again we didn't make
it through the GPU benchmarks though
that's good that's good news it's 1180
165 that's gonna be our seven we're
gonna do a 170 and I'm keeping it low
eleven eighty four eight and then we're
gonna do 175 and eleven m80 1680 1184
profile for any profiles six at 165 I
think profile for should actually be
eleven sixty if I remember correctly
what I was doing earlier and 140
and 1184 the boot profile so this one I
keep the first one low because if it's
unstable and you're trying to launch the
application it will definitely crash but
you can start at a lower clock and boost
it higher later and that helps that a
lot so that's why I'm doing that if
you're curious and we need to set up a
few more here but 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 ok
and ok so we're good on 9 kid profile 9
with good profile 9 right 11:30 ok 9 and
we are good on profile 8 I think 11 8170
yes profile 6 11 8165 yes sure
yeah that's fine and then profile 6 will
be 11 60 and 165 and then 4 is 1180 175
one is okay we're good look it
everywhere let's run it I think it was
Linus who crashed our stream earlier
pretty sure it was ok so alright so yeah
thanks for your patience has that crash
really looks like it's kind of working
now so if it goes down we'll come back
but it's it was an issue with the stream
PC for whatever reason I'm gonna get
some of the store orders here so we had
one from Nathan and Lansing Hoover just
a graph logo shirt thank you very much
late Nathan for that and that one we
have right back there on the wall we I
think we have a decent out of those in
stock right now I'm not sure though so
thank you for the graph logo shirt
purchased Nathan and keep trying to keep
an eye on the store bridge this is while
running hotkeys for the stream we'll see
how this goes
Oh a keychain purchase from Jennifer in
Downey California thank you very much
for that we got a video card components
poster purchase in where is this UK in
the UK thank you very much for that ROM
for purchasing that and that one I don't
know if it's got glare on it can you
even see that poster there's all cleared
out
anyway that's the video card components
poster so I'm watching for the memory
test now and we are going to drop the
memory clocks actually no we're not
driving them till later because we're
running low on the memory clocks right
now
but it's it's not artifacting nearly as
much as it was in this test earlier when
it was acting weird so hopefully things
are stabilizing a bit one degree in the
bucket that's good
that's what we need let's change
profiles hopefully it works Randy from
Wyoming purchased a one of our ceramic
mugs Thank You Randy for that and our
stickers and decals will to see those
going out as well okay that's the one I
need to watch no funny business times by
please please work like you were the
last three days
Jay was actually having this issue too
by the way mr. Jays two cents so he
posted a score around if it's changed
but pose the score earlier that was ten
points behind ours I think he was
playing around with dry ice was pretty
cool we want to get there eventually but
not not right now and he was having
issues we're just like we're having
right now the GP is just kind of acted
funny and every now and then they'll be
perfect every now and then they're not
so I don't know what the deal is but so
be it
sometimes you just push it so much on
the edge that it's not quite stable and
then seemingly randomly it will be and I
think we'll probably switch cards if it
doesn't survive this one without
physically switching on we just switch a
hit a dip switch okay so I'm gonna have
to drop the clocks a bit coming up my 20
megahertz on the memory and 10 megahertz
on the core and that'll help us
hopefully get through this but I will
see let's see what it does it's been
having trouble here and I start the cpu
test so this is where if it's got
artifact it's like crazy right there
actually didn't really well that time so
that's good and I think that's because
there's a lot of particles and there's a
lot of really complex geometry around it
shoot I need to switch down and so now
we're gonna look at oh you know what I
should do if it is OCP here's the trick
I could use
so if we're having OCP crashes on this
overcurrent protection if you don't know
it depends on if it's on the EPS rails
or not or if it's just like over power
protection I don't think we're over
power though I could actually drop down
the GPU power offset in this benchmark
via hotkeys and then that would reduce
our power consumption they're not doing
a ton right now but they're doing enough
where they'll run against the full power
consumption if they're allowed to so we
might we might be able to do that to
save some power if we have a power issue
without an additional power supply so
please please pass I really just want a
baseline here I got all right so where's
snowflake snowflakes not allowed in the
live streams she well she she will kill
it she'll jump in on the bench or
something
it looks like it's survived so maybe we
can start pushing the clocks back to
where they belong after this so Linus's
score 80 360 listening - eight thousand
one GPU 11,000 on the CPU we've dropped
two hundred oh did we just beat it that
was unintentional
sorry Linus actually didn't mean to do
that right now
I was genuinely trying to wait a little
bit until the memory was stable on the
GPS so that's awkward anyway we got to
beat our own score after this so he
still got more to do and I want to get
high so anyway man did they post that
video is that on their channel that's
super awkward man I'm sorry about that
guys I didn't mean to interrupt your
score so quickly we had some fun in
there we had some drama some excitement
some crashes OCP water that's too hot
because it's one point two degrees
Celsius but still beat it by accident
eighty four seventeen let me just save
this to the external drive because we
are having weird issues with the system
today just in case everything dies
so our GPU is low at 79 79 and his was
8,000 won we can get it higher than that
we definitely got higher than that
because I want to make sure I want I
want Linus's team to be six feet deep on
this one I want to make sure they don't
get up until there's a new GPU launch so
we didn't get a little farther on this
CPU score is 200 points lower that's
because I dropped the core by a hundred
megahertz I'd really like to get that
back but we're gonna focus on getting
back the GPU where it belongs right now
because setting these hotkeys is really
a pain in the ass so let's do that first
I'm gonna try I don't think it's gonna
work cuz they've been they've been funny
today I'm gonna try back where it was
for dual and go 12:40 we might need to
switch the Aces card for that I have a
feeling that aces card is the one that
was pulling all the weight previously so
okay we're good there we're good on that
profile or get on that profile we're
good everywhere let's go to profile 9
apply that and then let's run the
benchmark again and see if we can really
make sure we bury Linus to score as much
as possible - tech no that's not -
that's someone someone with the name
that looks very much like Linus type
this but it's not anyway feel free to
tweet an F or a rip at that Linus I
guess you get to donate 84 are they
streaming right now let me know chat
what's is line of streaming right now
I'll donate to know if they are
are they streaming let's see youtube.com
slash Linus tech tips
I missed the hot key we're just going to
abort this
all right are they streaming I don't see
them as streaming right now let me know
if they they pop up I think they have a
wank show today right so let me know if
they pop up streaming and we'll donate
some money to them I'll make sure I'll
send them back more money than they sent
us actually will be anyway because it's
conversion but just to send a message I
don't need your money Linus I'm gonna
send you more take that shrewd
businessman that he is I'm sure sure he
will appreciate that all right now with
our key we're good there okay so they're
not streaming yet yeah so I've said this
before but anyone in chat if you see
like J or lioness running youtuber
supposed to comment just kind of like
pasted a bunch when you see me
addressing chat because I won't see it
otherwise because I'm looking between
two things and okay Jin doesn't need
your charity that's right we're giving
charity apparently okay so we got a note
from okay it's up Andrew Cruise two
dollars twenty nine ninety wx6 gigahertz
Alan to please you might want to check
with their Bauer on that one I've been
talking with Roman though with their
Bauer about bringing him out here or me
going out there or something
which right now would be Taiwan's that's
what I can I have and realistically but
but talking with him about doing some
kind of joint thing even with Jay you
know I I don't think it's gonna happen
right now we have a lot of launches this
month that we're all gonna be focusing
on but what I'd like to do is get there
Bauer Roman out here and work with him
and get like I don't kingpin out to Jays
office and do pro overclock or plus
wannabe versus each other you can see
really it's if we're being honest that
would be their Bauer versus camp in but
you'd have the added variable of Jay and
myself to screw everything up so it'll
be a lot of fun I think so if you're
interested in that of course let us all
know but that's what I'd like to do I
think we can make it happen
it's just it's not gonna be immediately
because travel planning takes a little
while and they're launches this month
that are already public for the most
part all right so we're in GT 2 this is
a memory intensive
so i driving memory hired will help with
the score but driving memory higher in
this test is bad because it'll crash
because memory intensive so i actually
dropped the memory clock
contrary to what would otherwise make
sense so let's drop the memory clock
here and then we'll boost it all back up
in a little bit where he got some
artifacting but like builds i'd said
from actually hardcore overclocking
jokes is in chat apparently hi joker
thanks for joining I'll try and scroll
up and get your message after I hit this
hotkey so like build Zoid said this
artifact in I mean yeah realistically
you don't want that you're gonna drop
your clocks in the game realistically
you don't dump 30 pounds of ice into a
cooler an extra computer before you play
games so we're beyond realism here and
the rules of times I show that's gonna
hurt that dropped a lot of frames it's
gonna hurt our score a lot the rules of
times by if it even survives are as long
as it passes and it's not going to and
and validates then it will I'm gonna
kill this manually before it crashes bad
actually that might have been roped bad
time into you so as long as it passes it
will and validates it will be a valid
score okay so it did not like that's
weird because we had a really high
memory clock I think I need to drop
memory and GT to a little bit but we had
a really high memory clock of at 12:40
offset and GT 1 which is 60 megahertz
higher than it was in our first run
where I accidentally beat Linus to score
so we will we'll have to I have to drop
the GT 2 clocks a bit and we see my ok
on GT 1 so I think we're kind of finding
equilibrium here where it'll be stable
and not crash anymore ok that looks like
a blue screen out of my peripheral
vision but it's just windows same thing
though ok so watch all that stuff let me
check super chat and all that so first
of all like I said if you buy anything
from the store tonight during the stream
I'm going to try my best to shout out
first name where you're from I can't
guarantee it but oh you know what you
know what we should do we should do
something special or be meeting line has
to score by accident let's do this if
you if you pick up one of our video card
posters it seems appropriate a video
card benchmark after all pick up one of
our video card posters tonight
for all the video card poster orders
tonight
I'm going to write and I'll do it in
like a bottom right corner so it won't
be on the poster
bottom right corner alright something
like hashtag repel tt-to and sign it or
something so be a commemorative poster
so you pick one up on store that context
has done that one of the posters tonight
will check the time stamps from like
when this stream ran and any you think
any posters purchased during this dream
I'll just go sign them tomorrow and
write a repeal TD commemorat
commemorative signature on it
just so we could all celebrate and so
that Linus is accidental loss can live
forever that's too high eleven sixty I
got to do all this again
165 fortunately this gets faster and
faster as we go but 165 11 six we're
gonna set that a 6 and then I'm gonna
set an emergency one of 11:30 and we're
gonna set that as 3 so if it looks
really bad I'll drop into the emergency
you look super low o'clock let's try
12:40 again I don't know if it'll hold
we'll see and 170 and that's going to be
our primary score getter on the gt1
that's where we really need to get some
points because we're gonna lose points
on GT 2 with the memory and then let's
do 1180 and 165 for the start of the
memory test so that will help us
stabilize at the beginning I won 40 we
got to do some low ones Ness 140 1160 no
1180-1186 s
of them 34 our CPU frequency which
should help prevent any potential OCP
issues as well nine eight seven six five
but we do need a four this time in a
three to one okay actually I don't think
we need it for this time and that's Save
button man I wish it worked but three
okay three is our emergency clock
let's go with that okay swab GPU yeah
okay
he just tweeted GG hit us apparently
someone says on Twitter
did they where is it rip now it's
awkward gamers Nexus beat your score by
accident yeah I really was trying to
make that last a little longer okay
where did he tweet at us I'm looking for
it I'm looking I don't see it okay
anyway someone study tweeted us Steve be
SRD my PC without OSC I would be as
hurdy our own pcs via so did the stream
PC remotely it's over there and it made
this one shut down I don't know how that
happened
transmitted the instability like six
feet Hey
oh he's on a super chat that's how what
he did I don't see it I don't know okay
let me check super chats that while
we're talking about it so that's running
gt1 what CB are you using again 79-80
xee maybe he just didn't tag me on
twitter that's why I didn't see it I
didn't get the make the letter got lost
in the mail so who where'd we stop the
hunters five bucks thank you very much
said because the stream stopped while
you were putting more ice in my first
thought was oh no that's it riff Steve
did it electrocution there's no
electricity in there thank you very much
though freakinstinkin probably wouldn't
be enough to kill you anyway for being
honest might might make funny noise that
so it's some sort of surviving 12:40
offset man that was a close one though
it almost died so that's great
gt1 our score is really solid cuz we're
surviving at 12 40 megahertz offset of
memory which is insane because we're
stuck at 980 before we went ice so
that's great and it's also funny memory
straps as part of it too so we have four
and six here for as many boost sticks
can be dropped
threes an emergency drop if it really
looks bad just cuz I want to actually
pass the benchmark and because I know GT
ones good so that might carry us so we
beat Linus to score with I think in 84
17 I need to go on their super chat and
give them some money in a bit
to show them that I don't need their
money and also rub in the score but I
would like to give them more money than
that you know - I'm a generous person
I'd rather give you more money so
instead of giving you 84 bucks and 17
cents I'm gonna try and beat that score
and give you a bit more than that maybe
85 bucks
artifact again let's see if we can
survive its so this it really reminds me
of playing an RTS and I missed those
games a lot they're not as big as they
used to be but we're yeah yep so in an
RTS just like situations like this you
get into a scenario where at some point
you have to make a call and I just
dropped our clocks to try and stabilize
so if it closes gracefully I won't have
to reconfigure everything RTS you know
you get into a scenario where you have
to decide if you want to be greedy or
not and push push on the enemy where
maybe you shouldn't overextend and
that's exactly what this is where it's
all about how greedy do you want to get
with your score do you really want to
push that extra ten megahertz is it
worth it and the answer I think is yes
but we got a we got a push a little a
little bit more Anna or something maybe
colder okay
zeg that you're off CDG ten dollars OBS
is held together with the verge of
tweezers I think you might be right as
much as I like OBS for what it does it's
free I have to appreciate it
man it really does some screwy things
sometimes and I hope it does not do that
anymore
I think we probably need complete clean
install on the stream system all right
have to i want to drag this over towards
me do not gonna be able to get to well
but i'll be able to type it faster so i
won't be looking at it from an odd angle
i'm 65 okay what's our water temperature
right now
one point three degrees man that's hot i
won 150 for 165 eleven sixty okay what
is that even
that's gonna be profile six I kind of I
want to drop it a little more but you'll
see and then I'm gonna do 175 and let's
let's do lower let's let's stay eleven
sixty so this will help us hopefully
pass this time now to put that as
profile for then I need to switch back
to profile seven eventually so 165 I'm
trying to figure out like how much
greedy is too much greedy for these
scores by the way our GPU temperatures
eight degrees if you're curious I
haven't mentioned that yet which is
pretty damn cool twelve forty one
seventy okay that's gonna be profile
eight my phone is making noises is its
own we know
oh man I think there were a lot of
poster orders okay well so update on the
posters we have a lot of them in stock
so that's good oh yeah and just trying
to point it can you see it okay so
that's the post right there I cut it to
size but it's 18 by 24 that's our video
card Anatomy poster that we made and we
liked a lot but anyway I said that if
you buy a poster during this stream
because I accidentally beat Linus a
score I wanted to do something special
and that something special was going to
be in the bottom right corner
I'll just alright like rip LTT - oops or
sign it or something like that
so during the stream I'll get that for
you I'll go sign them tomorrow okay
so what do I have set and not set I
think we're almost ready to run the true
ripping in once I can find a damn stable
memory clock without being overly greedy
about it we need a 144 profile nine and
one
so there's profile nine in eleven thirty
here okay profile one
okay so profile wine 140 eleven thirty
alright cool right get their profile
nine one forty
no that's wrong Gopal nine that's not
right 140 this is why I'm checking
before I want to crash some stupid
reason later eleven thirty apply save
okay so one is 140 offset 1139 is eleven
thirty 140 cool that should actually be
eleven eighty though and then
eight should be higher its nine is good
eight is 12:40 on the core or the memory
excuse me which is a lot 170 on the core
which is pushing our stability I 165 I
live in 80 good well Evan 61 75 that's a
greedy profile and then we'll go back up
to 7 after after that I guess I was 6
what's 6 ok cool and then forest okay
got it got it
I think we're good let's see if it'll
work so okay that's thank you very much
for the poster orders I hope I hope you
will be okay with me not trying to read
every single one of the posters I'll see
if I can spot a few of them and read
them while I'm managing this but you
will definitely get a signed one with
the rip ltd commemorative right not it
we got to do that I didn't mean to beat
him so early the stream No so Roman sent
you his voltage control agenda he no he
actually didn't but in Roman if you're
watching they'll take it from you I
definitely use that okay
Hall of Fame is still lagging apparently
laddus does not have an Envy link bridge
right which is why we are using a single
card right now I've disabled the second
one physically and hardware so we're
going for a single core first score
because that looks like you crash to me
single score first and then we'll go
back to double at which point it's
impossible to catch their bearer with
what we have and probably at all so I'll
see what we can do though I would love
to revisit dual cards one more time and
give this thing a proper send-off
because I I got a Tarrytown I mean that
ice tank is on top of our set table we
can't shoot a bolt right now so we got
to tear it down that means we have to
give it a proper send-off tonight max
like beating Linus is a good start to
that we'll revisit
maybe our own score a bit later Jay got
super close to our score I think he can
do it he's 10 points away so Jay I
believe in you but I also completely
appreciate the cutoff point where you
like I got to do other stuff because
we're getting to that point here this is
so much work if you ever watch build
Zoid they're bauer kingpin you all the
respect for them because just doing this
with the ice is a huge pain it's
disassemble everything you put rags on
everything and insulate it all clean it
all after it's gonna really suck to
clean this stuff but we can restore it
all the original state it's just not
gonna be fun so respect to them all
right so I need to boost here we've
really don't want to crash this time so
I drop the memory clock 20 megahertz for
mine on greedy profile so we're gonna
boost to the greedy profile here where
the current draw is low as it's it's
elevating into the top there's not a lot
of complex geometry you can see in the
top now we're going to start getting the
complex geometry very fast so once you
see the first few flickers assuming it
doesn't into crash I'm gonna drop down
see where am I going I'm going to
profile 6 for that to be a bit less
greedy on everything if we see flicker
in
okay there we go got some flickering so
some memory artifacting I don't know
it's the fact that it's not doing it as
much this time is almost concerning okay
we're gonna drop dropping it there
hopefully it's enough please do it a
drop 20 megahertz off of the memory and
turn off the core so that if I didn't do
that right there that's why the hotkeys
are so cool and he'd shout out to Richey
from our patreon group and build Zoid
for alerting me to those trip this tips
and tricks and so now we're dropping it
a lot not completely because we're in
the CPS core part of the bench and I
don't want to go over power and and shut
it down like we did the first time which
is when I think I forgot to set the
profile so that's why I shut down at one
time oh man all right let me check the
chats and stuff greasing your GPU and
Vaseline how much okay I'm not gonna
read the rest of that but I start we're
always going tracing your GPU though and
Vaseline will actually help insulate it
when shows live apparently let me go
donate to them hang on is it where is it
stay with us though because we're gonna
we're gonna push it further do they
stream to YouTube these days I think
they do I don't see it yet all right
add salt to the ice water yeah so we I
mean I'll show ya I guess let's show off
some of this system for the people who
just got in and I guess we'll be careful
not to actually own plug-in you get over
there
all right oh yeah I guess we should
check the score first good call
so what's the score line us be stream
and everyone be prepared to send your
either notices to them of the score 83
17 is where we were when I accidentally
beat a score there we go
84 46 wasn't even though 84 17 that's
where it was 84 17 I think is where I
was so 84 46 beat our accidental score
beating Linus by an additional couple of
points 20 30 looks like about 30 I think
I think we're 84 17 before so that's not
bad either more we push the CPU another
200 points higher we're at 12,000 200
over there so let me save this that you
know what let's plug into the internet I
can't do that the Internet's on the
stream in DC maybe I'll use a wireless
adapter I want to upload the score while
they're live just to make sure they get
the memo because they didn't about the
duel cards apparently and they were so
happy that they beat everyone 84 46 a
446 okay let me grab a wireless adapter
and upload that score assuming
everything's stable I'm going into the
other room hang on say whereas there's
one that'll work as long as the drivers
around there hopefully this will just
straight work
okay alright so we'll see if that
detects if it doesn't then I'll get
another one do it later or something
because this is a super stripped-down OS
for benchmarking so it looks like it has
no driver's
that's what's it also this is really old
so they might not have drivers for that
anyway Patrick do you know where our
better wireless adapters are the ones
with like the antenna 90 degree angle on
looking for a USB you wanna all right so
anyway 84 46 is what we got
and Linus talking shit apparently
according to chat well you know what
we're gonna give Linus money to shut him
up normally works so 80486 that's what
we're gonna give him $84 46 cents until
I run it with a 5.1 gigahertz CPU and
like I said if you if I we're doing a
special thing here tonight
commemorative repel TV poster it's
actually just our video card Anatomy
poster except I'm going to I'll sign it
that'll write like rip LT t2 or repel TT
oops or something like that because I
did not intend to beat him that quickly
alright I someone tweet me a link to his
stream tweet out gamers Nexus please
with a link to his stream so that I can
go give them money
because I don't I don't think you can
send them in chat anyway like I said
stored on cameras next to Stata net and
that will have the posters on it I'll
paste that in chat one sec man serene
something crashed for a second okay cool
so let me check the Twitter links here
see if anyone sent that to me thank you
very much so some of you sent me the odd
it's twitch can't even give them money
on twitch how does twitch work I have an
account that's low again let's give
Linus some money I know I don't know
what they're saying either they're
opening the score site we haven't
submitted it yet I don't know that they
realize that so we have definitely have
wireless USB adapters somewhere I'm
gonna thinking over here in this bench
maybe anyway maybe it wasn't in the
adapter bin okay all right well we can
um we can do something about in a bit
let me get their twitch page open and
what is it is it subscribe on twitch is
that how you give them money none of us
alright
bits I don't see how to do it whatever
I'm not a twitch user sorry guys hey
he's talking about kingpin and four-way
SLI someone saying yeah so a previous
score 84 17 someone's asking alright
you give them bits everyone saying okay
I will try to do that so the those he
battles been good we have a lot more we
need to do though and more paid options
yeah I see okay Oh get bits oh man
that's a lot of worry a bit later
all right so anyway someone's saying
find a stock and get shit about the
community yeah so I'll do the same this
has been a really fun battling we're
gonna keep it going right now with dual
card that's next but it's been fun
because the art here is launched I don't
can chat agree like I think we're all
pretty disappointed in RTX in general is
that a fair statement I'll check I'll
check the chat but uh yeah so I I think
this has been a good way to get some fun
out of it okay can vibe it's fine fine
we'll do it ten dollars for a thousand
bits if I can just use PayPal that'll
make this easy we can give them money
and nope nevermind sending a code to my
other phone I can't do it alright let's
do it let's do more of this so what I'm
gonna do now is I think can we get a
little higher here 8009 guess we can we
can push the CPU score and I'm gonna try
you know what Patrick if you can
download the drivers for this one I can
plug this one in it's just the system
doesn't have drivers on it get the name
of it off of the sticker on the side and
then I'll upload our score
so hopefully Linus can see alive if some
of you can spam them with it once it's
up do so kindly don't break any rules
I'm just gonna push the CPU another 100
megahertz we're going for 51 on the
first two cores I'm gonna check chat
everyone's saying this is the most
interesting thing about r-tx okay tell
you your phone won't work because
there's no wireless device on it yet
that's not what I want but Patrick's
grabbing drivers for me for the one
wireless key we have here and we're
gonna see if that's that's good enough
what was I on for my profile you know I
should walk you guys see the profile too
so I named this profile 15 to 42 and
this is the one that we used to post our
original 15,000 242 score which J is now
just ten points behind he's really hot
on our heels so a lot of our score comes
from careful tuning on the memory which
is now in ice and we'll probably need
more at some point temperatures 1 point
3 in that ice bucket it's getting a
little warm two point seven in the loop
degrees Celsius so getting us under ice
allowed us to push to five point one
gigahertz on the first two cores then 50
on the remaining 16 it's an 18 core CPU
and we have a 34 mesh mesh is huge year
that's driving a lot of our score we
have not touched BC LK might have a
little more room in there it's really
not worth it to be honest and then what
I really spent a lot of time on was the
memory and this is the the most
important thing I've learned in this
whole process and I think Linus was just
saying good things about this too it has
been a very educational process for all
of us because this informs our future
reviews so memory I tuned it down so we
got CL 15 pretty stable I kind of had a
wrasse tier ass of 26 sort of but it was
more stable on 28 and also view Titan
times too much they start having they
actually degrade in performance in some
benchmarks been on the benchmark for
latency versus everything else and for
active window Tifa for active window we
have that at 38 build so it tells me I
should be able to get it lower but I
really can't get it stable
20 on see wrt RFC so this is a refresh
cycle this is an important one to
understand as well thank you and refresh
cycle is going to be how quickly the
memory is able to refresh for its its
data in the cells whereas refresh
interval our efi
is the time between refreshes so one is
how quickly it takes to refresh once a
refresh has been initiated and the
that's this one you want this number to
be lower the other one is how long it
takes to initialize a refresh and you
want that number to be really high you
want the number to hold the data as long
as possible
leftmost the rest to auto I think you
can push some of these down to even one
I think Richie did that we can push
these down to like seven but it's it's
kind of unstable so I don't really want
to fight instability right now we've got
there and we're cke what do we have ck
yet we've got that at 6 that's fine okay
so let's try this this is 5.1 5.00 is
disc or as a builder it's saying
something TC WL should be TCL minus one
okay thanks spelled Zoid
he says that t4 is way too high I know
but like I guess we can mess with it on
the stream of it let me push one more
score without screwing with the memory
settings but I had it was crashing when
I dropped T far earlier WL should be TC
l minus 1 TC WL should be TC L minus 1
is what he's saying WL TCL 15 hours
there should be 14 okay thank you very
much girls would see if it works how
most people get really bored of memory
och I think you're right it's important
to learn I'm glad we learned some of it
I'm I'm not any good at memory
overclocking but it's it was really just
a patience game for me anyway I changed
one number I would do I would test it
I had logged the previous number the new
number for the score and log of percent
difference and if it was an increase of
at least 2 percent then I kept the
number the change all right so let's
keep this going let's see when shows
live on YouTube cool I wonder if they
launched it there specifically so I can
give them money well I just couldn't
turn down an opportunity for more money
so he's gone live or hey what was our
score 84 or something I saved it
results load 80 and 84 46 okay where is
okay super chat there we go I can do
this one send super chat we're gonna
give them 84 dollars and 46 cents and
I'm gonna say I don't need your charity
hashtag rip LTT - all right
hashtag Ron benchmark hashtag oops
okay bye and sans there we go oh hang on
hang on
I got a type in a number should we pull
a line us and like expose the credit
card to the camera like he did that one
time
they're on number all right
okay thank you all right let's do that
84 46 incoming
all right so your message has been
delivered it says there we go there you
go Linus enjoy it if let me now stay on
chat let me know if he says something
about that cuz I'm not gonna be able to
hear him obviously say you'll have to
keep us mutually informed okay so let's
do this let's do this one more time
let's see single score one more time and
then then we'll try and upload after
that and then we'll switch to cards and
I'll show you what this thing's really
capable of when we're competing in the
benchmarks
it was meant to compete in that single
card we just had to bounce back and he
threw out this one last time
of course we very much appreciate
lionesses team participating and -
himself it's very good for the community
I think it's a lot of fun and everyone
enjoys it so all good things from us so
we need 175 once 1160 that is going to
be our six actually so let me put this
in five for now we're gonna load six so
six 165 offsetting eleven sixty that's
what we want to go to okay I know we're
gonna do so 1161 25 that'll get a four
and then we'll do a 170 and 1184 our GT
to test that we'll go to seven and then
we'll do twelve forty this is by the way
great trick now to really get a higher
score what we should be doing is
something else like getting better cards
or using Ellen's whoo or dice or
something
dry-ice but for purposes of our for our
limitations this is gonna be about the
best we can do is is manually setting
the clocks and each part of the
benchmark and
I mean we got big differences it's 60
megahertz difference in the memory
depend on which part of the benchmark
we're looking at so that is a huge gain
I'll check super Chad's and all that
stuff in a moment thank you for your
patience while I said all these clocks
and I also I'm gonna check so give me
about give me a second here I'm going to
check and see if line has said anything
and pasted and chat spam our chat with
it if if you said something ok so not
give me one second about nine eight is
good seven is good for is wrong let's be
175 and eleven sixty so that's four and
then six should be eleven sixty and 165
for is eleven yep okay good
seven is 170 and we'll have an eighty
okay alright we're good to go let's
launch this and then I'm gonna check
chat right now and see if anyone has
anything I need to see Linus is salty AF
salty Linus is salty - too much arrested
apparently yeah he doesn't know that it
was a joke I don't know he's just trying
to get me to give him more money
honestly let's do it anyway I'll wait
for this score let's get more money
after this score apparently he didn't
get it tell him that it tell him that it
was that's what I even say I don't need
your charity that's right alright so
we're gonna bump that know he laps at
the end apparently okay I don't know I
never know if I can trust chat or not
cuz chat sometimes miss reads liest here
so wonder wonder if his phone is on
oh wait I got a text from so on
okay we're gonna go out see how it
crashed
who is this ha Edd's all from LTT sent
me a message said about stars star
boughs down
let's call Linus and see if he'll answer
Linus
all right
I don't think he's gonna answer tell him
to answer his phone so ok they're saying
he knew it was all fun here's Plan C
already cool
tell them to answer his phone though
seriously I think we crashed from GT to
answer Linus I know you're busy it's too
ashamed the answer no he's too busy to
answer you streaming I want to say to
answer your phone
damn alright well I tried maybe he'll
call me back I don't know I'll leave it
there so I'll turn the volume up so I
can hear it alright
did I miss a number I probably did oh
wait are we in GTT right now know that
Erik scores gonna be lower that's fine
better finish call Luke someone's saying
all right so I've got a one of our other
guys saying Linus was fine ignore chat
all right cool yeah I figured he'd get
it so I think I was in the wrong
frequency for the first part of this
test I'm just gonna abort it while it's
stable
and we're gonna place that I'm focusing
I'm trying to call Linus
we're gonna go ahead and place one more
single card score with five point one
gigahertz I see uh like I said the if
you purchase one of our video card
Anatomy posters during this stream we
are going to assign it specially with
the rip ltte and of course in case
anyone didn't get the memo none of this
is actually literally a beef J and I had
a lot of fun with it we were talking
constantly about like you know trying to
help each other beat the other score
talk about our results I got dry I saw
how far do we really want to go spend a
lot of fun Paul I was talking with him
about it and he's been pushing his
system as well so fun to see Paul get
involved with that I really want to fly
out there and see if I can fly out there
after this next series of launches and
do something with all them and we've got
Paul Kyle J on the same area and EVGA H
Keys out there and we go over there and
do some L&amp;amp;T overclocking with kingpin or
something that should be the conclusion
of this kingpin beats our scores but
submits it under each of our profiles
with the same number so the top four
it'll be kingpin proper they'll be
gamers Nexus Jay Paul and Kyle or Lyle
all tied and kingpin will have achieved
them all but will log into our own
accounts to do it I think that's the
proper way to end the battle it was Paul
Paul's Hardware what do you mean who's
Paul haha
calls Hardware on YouTube then we check
him out J's two cents of course on
YouTube check them out - I didn't
mention his name because he wasn't in
the duel card thing but - we we did have
a lot of fun working with on our earlier
if LTE he was of course a great sport
about it all and we went out to LTX
visited him which is by the way it was
probably the best event I've been to
genuinely LTX as opposed to convey texts
we like a lot for different reasons but
LTX is fun just because it's direct fan
engagement and viewer engagement so we
talk to people and like I get to put
faces to the numbers and see this is
what our audience is and and talk to
people so I like del TX a lot for that
just in case anyone was unclear that we
don't actually hate each other just
sometimes people are alright I'm
promoting his shit and giving him money
I don't actually hate him okay so where
we might survive GT - this time I
dropped it a bit I'm going to look at
some of the orders check your ice bucket
yeah it's probably a probably getting a
bit melty I can hear it people talk
about Paul's solar - that was a good
video sneeze we're at 1.5 degrees in the
bucket we're good i supply melted but
we're definitely okay alright so this is
where this is the point of greed how
greedy do you want to be how far do we
want to push our clocks before dialing
it back and as I said earlier with the
guys build so I'd said to me the
artifacting is like bits of your car
falling off during the race but as long
as we finish the race it's okay I'm like
earlier when we blue screened which is
it gets cool into your car flipping over
or something alright so we're gonna drop
everything on the GPS this is the new
change so this is what I put it to 5.1 I
don't know I hope it's gonna survive
so hopefully hopefully it survives
though he had his phone in his hand
everyone saying his his phone in his
hand right now for the shownotes I guess
he's free to call me back I'm not gonna
bug him multiple times during stream
though he's trying to make actual
content call now man guys are so
demanding I hope to call him after the
stream and apologize for calling I'm so
much
dammit we crashed in the CPU test we
need more voltage on B core it's in his
hand again you there so first of all I
have you on speaker don't say anything
that you don't want to reflect poorly on
your image I was just calling cuz our
chat said that you you read our message
and I wanted to make sure you knew it
was in jest you mean the one that you
guys pulled out the one you guys pulled
out and when you drop the mic on Twitter
I'm so sorry lioness is there is there
anything I can do to make it to stop the
bleeding
negotiations next year hey thanks thanks
for keeping it going I think it was good
for the community and you were streaming
so you missed it but I actually just
before you called plug the hell out of
Al TX so I'm glad to hear you're you're
joking because I'd have to take it all
back no we there's too much going on
yeah sounds good yeah all right have fun
with your stream really all right we've
got chat telling me cinema poster I
think I'm gonna do that so there's the
Linus from Linus tech tips that's cool
of course thanks Linus for answering if
you watch this later so yes I did read
some of the super chats I haven't for
the last couple minutes that on the
phone with - let's check some of those I
will I'll send them a poster sure we can
do that
okay and I'll be at LTX of course I like
their event and it ended up being an ad
for Linus anyway so he took the
opportunity where he saw it but I'm okay
with that cuz I did very much like
healthy act Richard good said it
scrolled down
I got a scroll up alright let me scroll
back up to the super chats here it is
Richard good five bucks thank you very
much for that helps us of course with
streaming it's it really does help a lot
with these streams really excited for my
autograph mod Matt now I just need to
clear some desk space where it yes they
are quite large it's four by two and
that's big I'm aware but we are working
on a medium size it's just I got to wait
for the samples to be perfect at some
point so okay next one Motorsports exon
we get back to ten twenty in a second
374 thank you much
the exact amount needed for mosquito
spray is pretty bad here right now
we'll put five dollars are any of you
all going to catch froggie fresh and
Chapel Hill tomorrow do you even know
what that is I don't think so but have
fun Linus tech tips of course 8360 hello
friend saw that one oh did we get the
old super chats back maybe we did Dez
Jones $5 Steve you should do a OC
competition again next year with seven
an Amir Vega and done - I would be happy
to do something with either one of those
products crack on PCH k-25 what would
happen if someone tries to OC with
liquid helium is that possible yes
liquid helium overclocking is possible
and it's incredibly expensive what ha ha
it's really expensive I forget the exact
amount it's like well I know the amount
it's 4.4.4 point $4 per unit of time I'd
have to look at my own website to see
what that was
let's see liquid helium there Bauer CES
gamers and actually his contacts I think
I talked about it okay gigabyte used
$20,000 worth of liquid helium
previously to get a score and let's see
what was I forget the exact cost I'm not
gonna waste anyone's time right now but
it was it's a lot of money it's I mean
gigabyte use 20 grand worth of liquid
helium for overclocking so and speaking
with
and speaking with Roman their Bauer
about this previously it was pretty
clear that using using like what helium
just wasn't worth it but for the most
part alright let me get back to
benchmarking after maybe two more of
these Motorsports five dollars I'd like
to thank Linus for the four dollars you
yes my stands by Matt five dollars my
other SC got lost
Oh super chat yeah I'm sorry it all
crashed I'm really sorry for everyone
who sent it in then what I will do is I
think I can see super chats after like
two days later when all this processes
and what I'll do is I'm gonna try and
get through those and include them in a
mic and ask Gian or something so we'll
try and do that okay five dollars per
litre from Google thank you very much
for that see where we're getting a black
Gian mousepad yeah I probably eventually
and your muscles by Matt the rest of
your question what's the best thermal
paste on pads to replace old stuff on a
1080 TI FCW three the discord is worth
the $5 month thank you very much so good
paste so paste ultimately it doesn't
matter a ton as long as you eventually
replace it because a lot of stuff they
use is like dow corning or what are they
called
it's I can't run any of it there's a
Chinese company in Shenzhen that makes a
lot of the thermal paste on video cards
all of them I mean if we're being honest
or they're but so those are commonly
there they often cure that's the real
problem but of course our current ad for
the streamer response for the stream is
thermal grisly so I'll mention that they
make cryo not and hired or not it is
genuinely good paste that's why we have
them as an advertiser I wouldn't
recommend liquid metal even thermal
Grizzly's like a novel for GPUs just not
worth it too much risk doesn't do much
so thermal Grizzly's high-end stuff is
good but you don't need to go that
high-end either there's plenty of
options
there's gelid extreme kingpin makes his
own paste which is more or less the same
their own performance as the other
high-end pastes like cryo nah it's just
blue and then there's plenty of other
Arctic MX series there's pretty good for
a cheaper option of case as well
what you're looking for though is non
curing that's looked like specifically
look in their marketing language or in
reviews for non curing because that is
what causes problems down the road is as
it as it ages
they'll harden and crack and and all
those high-end pace that I just listed
do not cure so they're good for a long
time once you replace them what are we
doing right now oh yeah that's right I
think I boosted the or I was going to
boost the beak or I missed it because I
called - okay so I'm going to call Lyle
now what are they live or something why
is everyone telling me to call J no
thanks build Zoid cryo not has a
tendency to fail below a negative 120 C
that's good to know we're not there
though our ice bucket doesn't get that
cold but good to know nonetheless let's
do this one point four six and try and
just close out the single scores a call
with Linus is pretty funny though okay
everyone's freaking out about call J why
are we all freaking out about call J
all J they say I guess I have this on
speaker are they streaming why is chat
spamming me to call you okay you're on
you're on a speaker by the way yeah
another there told me to call you and
Lyle as if you two are together or
something but I guess not I haven't even
met while have you met Lyle weird it's
weird how none of us have met Lyle yes
yeah we had that we had earlier I would
have been I would have left it there you
score I can't I can't quite match you
I've got 12,000 300 PP you a real one I
think it clearly
I saw your wig though I'm looking
forwards if it is a week if you didn't
just grow your hair out for that video
so that I'm looking forward so now Oh
gotcha okay okay
so close windows and then closed down
okay okay yeah and I will I'll try and
fly out there towards the end of the
years here a little you know next month
or two so well what's the opt I'll try
and visit all you guys yeah
yep kingpins the next goal yeah all
right
all right thanks Jay see ya okay not
calling anyone else
I saw people telling me to call their
Bauer and various presidents and prime
ministers I don't actually have everyone
okay we're gonna try what he said I've
never tried that before call yourself
okay all right so let's uh I almost
don't even want to run single oh wait
that's right we boosted vcore
you might as well might as well do one
more single single benchmark so let's
just do one more of these and it'll
switch the duel and eventually shut it
all down eleven sixty one sixty five so
like I said I said a thing up there in
the corner of the window of the stream
but if you grab one of the posters will
sign it as a commemorative thing and of
course thanks to all the youtubers who
joined in it's a lot of fun for this but
we have more to do yet and more to learn
about overclocking while we do multi-gpu
so 1161 65 that's going to be our
profile six and then we're gonna do a
greedy version of that 175 offset that
will be profile for then we're gonna do
165 and 1180 and that's gonna be profile
whatever it was that I was in earlier
seven and then we'll do 170 and 1240
offset on the memory which is really
crazy and that will be profile 8 and
then we need a 140 and 1180 profile 9
one more profile make and then a 1130
and 140 profile 1 which will help
prevent overpower issues that we had
earlier where it just shut down 9 8 7 6
6 7 5 4 3 2 1 okay all right let's give
this one more shot so he's saying J said
try this he said close explorer.exe so
close Explorer where is it even details
explorer.exe eat kill that go for Tana I
don't know that's Cortana it's not I
think we don't have Cortana running so I
think we're good there I already killed
it I think although is that it right
there let's try it anyway
nyeh Cortana no one wants you alright
lets you see if Jays trick works for
anything so this is a single card still
we're pushing single card hashtag kill
Cortana hashtag rip no so II actually
Explorer shouldn't reboot itself that's
that was Jay's point search UI adducts
II thank you very much I need it later
I'll look for that figures Microsoft
would try trying to hide it alright so
let's see if I stay over five point one
now
sometimes what I'm really lonely I
talked court ah my god that's so sad
J is sabotaging you hashtag it's a trap
Oh someone says my anniversary sure it
came today check this cord I don't know
which one you if you got the photo one
awesome because those are gone that's
that one in the middle there's the foil
anniversary shirt we sold all those they
were limited we had to work with a new
supplier to get the bin we did custom
size and custom everything so all the
measurements on the shirt are completely
custom but those are gone you can't buy
those anymore we will probably revisit
that that exact same shirt style in the
future maybe with a different design on
it because that design we're not gonna
do again in foil
but thanks for picking those up so we're
waiting on GT to service is someone
saying disabled services yes so I
already I didn't get all of them but I
ran several scripts from the over talk
on that forums from Richie c77
and and disabled a ton of services
already I'm positive there are more of
them Windows has a lot of stuff but we
turned off a lot as is
all right so let's run gt2 can you mount
the motherboard upside down so the
condensation drips off off it's a really
interesting idea it's probably safer to
just try not to have condensation the
problem is I mean imagine trying to
mount this thing upside down I don't
know you do have a point for sure but
you have to like build something special
I mean honestly just wrapping it all in
paper towel seems easier even though
that is a pain but we should go over the
hardware again though let me hit these
hot keys for this and then I'll head
over there and we'll go over the
hardware so that everyone can see what
we're working with and we checked the
ice levels I'm gonna go for the greedy
profile now higher-frequency
we're at 2 degrees now in the and the
water color is actually pretty hot
comparatively so we got to be careful
about our temperature there we have more
ice though and we'll go dual GPU and ax
I guess so hopefully it passes and we
can also see what J's tricked it if
anything for our score and single GPU
although we should be higher anyway cuz
I'm at 5.1 if it even survives for two
cores 5.0 for the rest I need to check
super chats momentarily as well but this
is a more involved process now than it
used to be since I'm hitting hotkeys 10
we just jobs a ton of points on that if
it even survives now it's I guess the
point yeah okay I just drop the
frequency to the floor so we'll see if
it survives sometimes that'll save it
but not this time I don't let it go how
to see if it launches the CPU test
without freaking out and if it does then
we can at least see what our score is
there but it does not look like it
actually because I killed Explorer and
everything I don't even know if it's
just on the desktop or if it's trying to
close
okay well let's um let's watch the dual
GPU I think have you thought about a
walk-in freezer thought about yes doing
no Shawn $5 thank you very much here's
five bucks for hair supply it's keep
your hair awesome
it'll get used pretty quickly aleksander
5 euro here's more pizza money thank you
hopefully OBS doesn't crash again by the
way which cpu are we using data file two
dollars lgt coming in with the DDoS yeah
I think that was probably them Chi Chi
Yu ketsu ninja 5 euro
I wonder what if the CPU heatsink is
used as a water block just drill some
holes in it and solder copper pipes onto
it that seems like a Linus tech tips
project that seems right up their alley
I would love to watch them do that I
don't want to do that that sounds
difficult and like it wouldn't do much
but it'd be a fun experiment just Chris
$5 how much of a difference would it
make changing the thermal paste and pads
on my EVGA 1080 ftw2 with cara knott and
minus 8 pads the pads you probably don't
really need to change because erm just
get really hot like I mean they could do
125 C plus 150 C a lot of times is where
ATP is over time for protection so
unless the pads are like covered in dust
from age or when you remove the card
replace their own pace maybe the pads
tear then I would replace it but unless
that happens honestly you're probably
good with the same ones
aleksander t GG easy $2 that your macho
Alexander Jennifer Roger five dollars
for food drinks and toys for snowflake
throw them pays for your hair a rubber
mallet for Keegan oh we've got all the
memes in here and please tell Andrew
he's the best cameraman and 3d modeler
well I guess we can we can tell which of
the patreon backers I've been a cop for
a while thank you very much for that and
you got your message and we'll stretch
the five bucks for a rubber mallet for
Keegan too they are of course his
favorite I don't know what he thinks
they are but he uses them for everything
the slowest slave is $5
looks like they donated their score oh
yeah we did that cut that already
$84 17 set it onto line SF thank you
catalogs for that you funded
I guess $1.99 can't send more it
triggers LTT over currency production
though because Canadian currency yes
Mario my $10 I'm gonna get back to this
in a second I just purchased an
autograph mod Matt a few minutes ago
would love to have it signed with RIT
badly dear Jared Paul to commemorate
this epic week I don't know if I can we
don't technically do like what is it
called personalized signatures because
then the pipeline my distributor to have
to find yours and then give it to me
then I have to drive out there
specifically sign that one and make sure
someone else doesn't get yours because
then that'd be weird
I will however be signing it you can be
sure of that and we've got the posters
which I'll be I'll sign all of them with
the same repeal TT thing alright let me
do the next three here and then we'll
move on to the benchmarks David 5 euros
have you received enough feedback to
create a mouse mat rather than a pad in
the near future or the black/white theme
you mentioned preferably both I think
for this one we'd probably do blue and
black next instead of instead of white
and black it's like this one we like
this mouse pad a lot it is on Startalk
and resides just on that of course but I
totally hear you some people want a
black instead of a white we can do it
and then we're also we do have some
ideas for Mouse maps that are larger we
just haven't made them yet I have to do
design you know all that stuff first
validation okay let some dual GPU I said
we're gonna do so what we're gonna do is
shut this down water temperatures
getting kind of warm now it's at 2.2
degrees Celsius and 3.9 degrees for the
GPU loop so I'm gonna shut this down and
I'm gonna take a something small to push
the dip switch into the on stat our
state for our second GPU I should turn
this off before I stab it with the
screwdriver
okay so there's just a dip switch in
here on the X 299 dark board that
physically disables the PCIe devices so
now they are all enabled which will
enable our second card and I'm gonna
have to install drivers for that I think
you know what we should do we should try
that EVGA bridge - I haven't tried it
yet but
I can't do it without like ripping the
cards out but it's kind of holding
everything together right now okay
please don't please don't fall over
let's let's see that this thing works
like I'm not sure if it's gonna be
cringe or cool
I want chats let me know because last
time I saw people saying it looks like a
Cylon saying it looks like a Protoss
ship so we're gonna switch on B link
fridges and I also saw a lot of people
saying it like portable so let me know
how what your opinion is certainly my
feelings won't be hurt there you go
that's what evj sent out it does kind of
look like a scourge from starcraft from
brood war I could see that I could see I
could see it potentially looking like I
don't know like some some carrier ships
from the Starcraft okay there we go
that's awful do sick and it's okay
cringe better than the silver one that
looks dope AF looks bad looks like a
fortune cookie Batman and space invader
okay got a good mix there does it fit I
hope it's the right size
okay all right please click pretty hard
when you installed on any env like
bridge so oh I didn't think about where
I had this position there we go
let's get this thing going again do we
need ice how's the ice level doing I
think we need some ice
let's get some ice in there hang on one
sec guys I'm grabbing some ice for our
dual GPU tests so that we can keep this
going all right no ice
someone asks I saw where's the fantex
evolve X we just got one of those in and
it's on loan from a viewer so thank you
for sending that on loan and I'm
breaking up huh and we're going to be
testing it pretty much immediately I
mean this weekend so we're working on it
we've seen your requests we got one end
for someone who pre-ordered one and
we'll be sending it back to them after
we review it so that will be part of our
normal content that we're going back to
after all this is is over with let's try
not to get it on the test bench
I'd rather spill it on the floor than
somewhere else
I was getting kind of hideout I'll be
careful Splash Damage
okay okay we're good to go
the stream died again that would be
appropriate every time we put ice in so
that should help us get back down
towards zero we'll be hopefully about
0.8 all right
so do I need to reinstall the dryers
it looks like I do so it's here's what
we're gonna do our own install that
video drivers get envy link working with
two cards now so this is gonna be it
this compute last chance to see this the
whole thing that you just saw the ice
bucket in action and so probably the
next architecture launch if we do them
what I like I said I have to get back to
reviews let's get back to new products
coming out so and so does J and everyone
house so we're all like okay how do we
let me conclude this is how I'm gonna
conclude it with one more send-off of
benchmarks while it's all built and then
our next thing we would end up doing if
anything would be dry ice and that's not
gonna be in the immediate future though
I would I've got stuff I want to buy
special for that and we'd probably wait
for another processor or GP or something
like that anyway alright so let me check
all the super chats while this installs
drivers I'm gonna do a clean install on
this so fee $1.99 builds Lloyd said high
score equals always GN or jz2 cents I
don't know what that means I'm sorry
I'll check this card and see if you
messaged me nope alright I don't know
what that it's get some compressed
liquid co2 just do it no no this is it
right now it's just ice that's enough
for now
custom clean install no 3d vision next
okay alright I just ordered a poster
great stream thank you like I said you
know I'm gonna read some of those orders
off the posters will be special
commemorative ones but it'll be the GPU
and I don't Eve hoster except I'll do a
commemorative note on it I only read a
couple these at random here Jacob from
Illinois picked up a poster Thank You
Jacob
and we got let's restart that we have
this is just doing drivers right now
andrew from canada picked up a poster as
well thank you representing I think
Ontario it said Vilnius from Australia
nice
that is a poster as well thank you
Vilnius we got Jason from North Carolina
actually it's not going to go far and
that's gonna get you're gonna get a
poster as well thank you Jason
then we have Marc from Colorado picked
up a poster okay so this is booting
remember the CPU is still kind of
questionable oh yeah if anyone saw the
the sticker earlier the good luck stick
around there that's from ek ek
waterblock sent that with their - 560
rads that we have in the in the tank so
I stuck it there to make sure it
actually works and they did offer to
send ln2 pots so we're not gonna do it
immediately but it may be in the future
for us we do have to do some normal
heart hitting reviews though we're
filming the fractal s21 actually films
that what 70% of it today I did the
recording for and we'll film the rest of
it so that should go up over the weekend
if you're looking for a case for U of S
- we have it going all right so it's
booting
what's billed they say billed soit says
I'm gonna be benching the 99 100k on
Ellen to this month nice
so a check actually hard core
overclocking I guess if you don't know
who he is you'll maybe be able to see
some of that okay super chats atom two
dollars is there a discount code for the
live stream not this time but we do have
that special poster we're just gonna
check the time stamp starting under the
stream and send them out Tim how old $2
J that's it no message thank you Tim
James Wallace 20 bucks Chuck Jesus teach
us your magic how can you overclock so
well teach us how to be LTT in any
instance I don't overclock well I'm not
good at it but I guess there's there's
enough competitive feelings there and
enough patience we're just like so the
magic for the memory timings was to sit
down and change them all day and
according to build Zoid they're still
not very good but they're there let me
give you an idea though
so as a novice memory overclocked or
versus XMP with the same frequency so
4,000 I grits know timings tuning at all
versus what we have now is just timings
to me tuning and 4000 megahertz the
point difference in CBS core was about
400 so it took us from 12,000 to 12,000
400 or in the previous instances 11,500
plus you get the idea so memory is
really important for this kind of
benchmarking and it does impact your
game performance as well so everyone
knows that memory has had a big impact
on Rison it does have a big impact on
Intel too it's just I think less
discussed and less explored but it does
impact both platforms it's just you know
it kind of at some point you get into
territory where you're you're not really
sure if it's even worth doing timing
tuning anymore if you're just playing
games and you're trying to avoid
spending the whole day doing that if you
don't know what you're doing like I
didn't that's C as for the CPU
overclocking so I've gotten a good feel
for that of course know where don't get
me wrong know we're close to someone
like their Bower builds with any of them
but all I did for that was just read a
lot and a lot of overclock dotnet guides
they have really good guides on this
and that's that's why I would recommend
starting I think we have to enable SLI
manually is it the TAC team no let's try
a restart it's not an SLI right now so
let's try or you start see if it picks
it up since we just installed those
drivers all right where is a good place
to learn how to overclock and tighten
timings let me give you some basics here
so learning how to overclock the things
you need to be concerned about are not
pushing the voltage too high so don't
like the voltage you want to increment
everything so you want to increment like
the voltages by 0.1 0.0 something never
go don't don't ever type in like 2 volts
the increments are really small so be
careful of SRC voltage on AMD be careful
of Si and IO voltage on Intel be careful
of V mesh on Intel
if you push those too high you can start
degrading performance and the scary
thing with voltages is you won't really
know that you're too high on it unless
it's overheating until maybe six months
or a year down the line when you can't
sustain the same clocks anymore because
it'll just slowly kill parts of the chip
but there are safe voltages and you can
just Google search for safe voltage on
insert processor here and I would check
guys on overclock dotnet or something
because they tend to be pretty good and
detailed
why are we not detecting the second one
or what it sees two cards maybe it's not
maybe the bridge isn't fully connected
let's switch back to the other bridge I
guess I don't know if it's maybe a piece
of tape got stuck in there or if it's
the bridge we're using it's not
detecting or something so let's just
switch the bridges okay oh it was not
the bridge was not fully seated but I
know this one will fully seat so let's I
think the EVGA I want spine to be clear
is there any tape on the back of this
the pins
you see any tape on that okay because
that would have blocked contact as well
I think it's fine it didn't feel fully
seated on the first card but I know this
will work I don't wanna waste time so
we're gonna go to that I mean walk on
the other side here and just
double-check that the card seated so for
the first card
it's an XC ultra and we have it in a
riser which you might be able to see but
we have that in a riser and that's to
make it tall enough to reach our a Seuss
card it's a little janky
but it was the only thing I could really
do because otherwise I was stuck with
the F II card which Eris kind of doesn't
overclock that great okay see if that
does it
someone saying I had to move jumpers
change speeds and multiplier II that was
definitely it's a lot easier now yeah
for sure
okay nice builds Ord says he should be
getting a XIII 90 dark to play with I
think that's long where they moved the
8-pin connectors to be next to the 24
pin connector for cable management
purposes so I'm curious to see if people
actually care about that moving the
eight pins it was apparently very
difficult to do from an electrical
standpoint
mr. pointless traces way across the
board now oh that's right if you're
watching that we need to see his envy
link detecting yes we have envy link
cool I've got two cards we're back in
business so let's get that enabled Linus
tech tips Canadian a one dollar what's
that for her
did I like give him a dollar too much to
the points or something why why a dollar
thank you though I'll be sure to give
you a dollar when I'm back in Canada
okay so I need a good there need
precision open and oh he need battery
for the camera can you like plug it in
and then switch the batteries nice we
might lose camera for a second if he
does that we'll see all I'm gonna do
though is set some clocks and then I'll
read some super chats and actually we're
doing that for two cards now so I'll
wait a second okay
why - gave a dollar
why why does treating you all like
strippers oh he is he's just throwing
ones at us right now well I missed
actives one dollar Linus tank there's
one dollar I like stake there's one
dollar - tech tips one dollar Linus
Texas one dollar
thank you I don't know who you are I
don't watch your channel but we we
appreciate it I wish you a lot of luck
on YouTube it's it's hard but I think
you can do it you just have to have to
try but thank you you should really you
should be keeping your money for
yourself you know if you're a startup
youtuber it's expensive to get going and
you might need those dollars later to
pay for electricity or something six
bucks I think a less six seven now -
Texas one dollar whoo-hoo alt THQ went
to Linus during their LAN show and said
can I have the company card it's really
important that my detectives Canadian
two dollars sorry I can't hear you
I don't know if it's Ed's Alif it's
Linus if it's Luke Canadian Tire they're
just
he shut off stream abruptly just to come
here yeah all right
you gotta wonder hire missed actives
next next in the news later this week
why does tech tips goes bankrupt after
giving gamers Nexus all their money one
dollar at a time
- exits one dollar again
I'm 40 I can't even see the clouds
around we're doing two cards now and I'm
gonna check super chat again because
apparently it's a thing now 165 so we're
going to give this one good run actually
if I watch how many probably a few good
runs of dual card so eleven sixty 165
165 this is two cards so I have to do it
twice eleven sixty max power target give
me one second to check chat what do we
want is that eleven sixty that's going
to be profile six and then we're gonna
do I 175 eleven sixty and 175 eleven
sixty you have to apply at each time
that's gonna be our profile for greedy
profile speaking of greedy one dollar
Linus tech tips one dollar Linus tech
tips one dollar a stack tips gamers
Nexus is now a stripper question mark
they're trying to distract us from
beating their scores that's what they're
doing maybe they've maybe Anthony's gone
and hooked it up to something uh
something better to try and beat that
one we just posted 1180
170 that what we do 165 that's what we
do
165 so that is going to be
profile 7-eleven 80 of an 87 I'm gonna
do 170 a couple more numbers to do here
1240 170 why I can't believe Linus is
just throwing ones at us right now
12:48 the final 140 I got two ones to do
you do less than a dollar I feel like
that's what he should be should be
throwing change at us 140 or d11 80 this
is gonna be a boot frequency 140 1180 so
meticulous 1130 last one I'm 30
okay why one getting like tendinitis in
my hand from typing at this angle it's 7
6 5 4 3 2 1 okay apply save doesn't do
anything when I click it anyway and
we're gonna start at 9 and then launch
it and let's see what happens I'm a kind
of unstable CPU frequency is he still
doing it he's still doing it
when Tyler well I detectives $1.00 line
is Texas one dollar Alliance actives one
dollar one dollar one dollar okay - I
owe you whatever costs like twelve
dollars now - sectors two dollars chat
glitched out for a bit there I'm back
is it Linus that's what I want to know
you know what we should do is I think
I've enough time and before this gets
the night expansion I have like a
minutes is this it
nope that's my shit that's mine this is
you know what I have to say to you line
us whatever this means I don't know what
it means you guys made it you have your
telling about the arrow means but that
that's what I have to say to you he
crashed
I think they sell that I don't know I
really want it you can check it out I
guess I guess I'm promoting - the store
now because he keeps giving me money
okay so that was a GPU crash that's good
we can recover from that time spy
extreme hotkeys even working yes cool
what is it still written on there oh
yeah it's still written on there this
episode brought to you by heist active
anyone remember that the Titan V it's
been out of commission since we did that
stream I'm gonna wait for their next LAN
show and I'm gonna give them all this
money that they gave me back
okay all right I got to try and read
other super chats Linus is friggin
flooded it yeah let's see Carl J I did
that already please call him the LAN
show from WC Karen got that what is it
someone said the arrow means you have a
big ray is that what they said that
sounds so much like Linus Actives Linus
is trying to trick you into doing the
same amount of $1 donations back in USD
so he can exchange all his kinetic money
it's all a big scheme he knows that if
he gives us twelve bucks and I give him
12 bucks he ends up with 20% more than I
do
I'm on to you Linus it's a good one
it's the master the master schemer
nice I'm gonna try and get some super
chats 1000 Norwegian kroner thank you
very much I don't know if that's a lot
but if it is thank you very much and if
it isn't thank you very much
of course we always appreciate it helps
a lot good luck have fun that is from
Simon
yeah cobson from something I know okay
and thank you for that it's it is a big
help though has ate some chips before
this and I'm starving
I'll go spend that money on fried food
later all right
so I'm I got a focus for a second I'll
check the super chats in a minute 1000
Norwegian 120 USD wow thank you very
much like I said it's that's a lot and
we appreciate it and it certainly won't
go to waste
okay we got a got to make this stable
Rio will change batteries oh nice so
Andrew behind the camera you may have
well you wouldn't have noticed but while
all this was while Linus was throwing $1
bills at us and now sergeant Zeta is
doing it to you while Linus was throwing
singles at us Andrew plugged in the
camera into the wall because of the the
battery was dying switched batteries and
then unplugged it so nicely done got our
own own skills show over there
$1 charging Zeta why is the thing
everyone's out there like
the arrow means you ignore it at 1000
Norwegian donation I did not ignore it
and I'm still I've directly addressed it
and I'm still getting through all the
others CPU tests my past looks good why
not just leave it plugged in because
it'd be tethered then and we move it
sometimes to see the other system and
the battery has life in it so we're good
all right so I'm scrolled back up to
where we were finally let's see got
those got those got that question got
that question
Declan Gallagher two dollars thank you
they have that Dyson money though that's
true
I will say I'll take the opportunity to
say so out of all the Dyson videos
genuinely I like the Linus is the most
because he was like doing a studio tour
they walk around and show all their
stuff and every now and then it'd be
like oh yeah and then go back to doing
the tour so it was like the most the
most real content not a fall account
even though we made fun of it hey that's
good that's better than a previous one
15 to 49 nice let's save that in a few
places in case it dies I wasn't even
really focusing on that
what happened margin of error I guess CB
scored twelve thousand for xx that's our
highest score yet so ripped GN
officially everyone everyone a F for
respects for GN because we just beat our
own score of 12000 242 so hashtag ripped
again that's pretty cool first dual card
test that passed
and we managed to beat our own score so
nice that I did not try J's trick but
I'll go ahead and do that of disabling
stuff so let's kill explore and then
someone's holding it told me it was like
search something vxe explored I searched
nope let's services search UI dot exe
nice let's give it a shot
we're kind of borderline and stable even
right now so it might take a few tries
all right yes Cortana is dead that is
what search UI dot exe is okay show us
the ranking let me see if it'll load
let's see this Hall of Fame working now
okay had to hit our hotkey there Hall of
Fame time spikes dream I don't open it
in a new tab in case it's changed and it
doesn't work anymore and thanks again to
everyone who picked up the mugs tonight
the GM oh he did restock those recently
we also restocked the Raglan hoodies
these two-tone hoodies that he missed
them they've been out of stock for like
two months and a lot of sizes we finally
brought them back in so they're two-tone
it has a GN logo tear down logo on the
back is that visible yes and then it's a
lightweight hoodie so it's good for kind
of like spring type weather or fall
maybe that's got hair on it
sorry then the chest logo on the front
but those are back in stock do you
wanted one this one's all bunched up
because I use it to sleep on when I'm
flying
well three mark is not loading sorry
three marks Hall of Fame is not loading
but I do have an old window here from
probably a couple hours ago so I'm not
gonna pop it up on screen but if you
can't get it to load I've had this open
for a few hours now it might be out of
date but Roman of course in the first
16,000 248 I'm not gonna beat him today
or maybe ever without his own help he's
offered it
we've got 15 to 49 now it's not uploaded
J 15 to 34 super close and sounds like
we might both be taking a break after
this one but I don't know JJ's not the
kind of person to back down either but
also he and I both I think are feeling
the the stress of having a lot of things
we need to review build up from having
like our crazy OC challenge set up for a
week plus now but he's very close he's a
he was eight points away from that score
and a bit more from our newest score of
course but so hopefully this will
survive this time gonna focus on this
one and hit the hotkeys at the right
time and then check some of the super
chats and stuff
I think I'm gonna be assigning a lot of
posters tomorrow I take a while for the
commemorative posters
but I'm gonna have to send a lot of the
proceeds in the form of $1 donations to
align us on his next LAN show be part of
his his scheme that convert his Canadian
money into US money while both of us
give YouTube 30% of it works well for
everyone if your YouTube
okay it's that is very uh Narda facti
interesting I think that a C's card is
carrying here we might be able to push
those clocks a little but I don't know
if it's worth it really
mmm that Mouse is backwards Oh No drop
okay hopefully it dropped the GPU clock
some time looks like maybe if it shuts
down ya know we hit over power at that
point YouTube gets 30% rip yes I believe
that is accurate last time I checked
like I kind of get it because they're
hosting 4 hours of content every time we
stream every time anyone streams and
there's a lot of like I don't even if
you know what we're doing
look I love the content I think a lot of
you love the content but they're storing
it basically forever so I kind of get
the the 30% cuz there's not I don't
think those Adsense play like do you
guys get YouTube ads dollar
if Adsense doesn't play then I get it
oh my god - I have this I have to go up
and reads on these hang on uh there's so
many - things it's one dollar one dollar
one dollar one dollar sorry I can't hear
you underwent ollie Linus tech tips
Linus tech tips
why does tech tips two dollars good luck
refunding all of these trying to make it
hard for me now I'll sit there and do it
lines during your live stream - tag
that's one dollar one dollar what wait
wait - Texas 100 dollars Canadian nice
shirt
well that's for a higher that's lower
well if you if you like for the r-tx
shirt with the arrow pointing down at
the crotch area I guess they have it on
their store I'll plug it since he gave
us 100 bucks
anyway he kept doing it to you - Texas
one dollar
well this one's good he sent an MJ link
in on what is this a virus
intercom slash
I have to make sure I can show it
because sometimes Linus actually shows
his credit card number on Twitter don't
hang on yep okay that's good we're clean
there's what Linus sent in card declined
did I just give him a free ad he tried
to send us a hundred bucks that I gave
him an ad I take it back
tried to client it's what you get for
sending like $31 charges so we did not
gain any points from disabling an
explorer or Cortana our graphics core
I'm pretty proud of though this is lower
than previously our last one was higher
I think let's let's try like a bigger
push here for maybe a closeout see what
we can do at the very high end I'm gonna
try that's not what I wanted to do okay
cool
it's still good yes okay I am going to
try c8 we're pretty much maxed out here
we maybe try 180 megahertz but I'm
thinking that's not gonna work I can try
to push the memory clock our it's been
very good lately so that'd be a good
opportunity to mess it all up seven
we're at 11 80 megahertz for that test
we're dropping to it we can bring this
up to 1180 let's try that and we can
brain for up to 11 actually we can bring
for up to 1180 oh I have two cards now
so I'll have an 87 80 125 so that's give
me the new 4 and 6 we're gonna do eleven
sixty one sixty that one's good eight I
think we're gonna try
I want to try a higher everything really
but let's try 1260 and just see if we
ins to crash on this I'm thinking yes
that is quite high for memory offset and
I have two cars 1260 fly that's eight
and then there we go
okay profile 9 to launch so I'll get
back to super chat and stuff in a second
but while I'm while we're doing some
actual overclocking here for a second
not actually hardcore overclocking the
actual overclocking I will note if you
missed it I'm just setting profiles I'm
changing the frequency as we tab through
all the tests and times fly based on the
current load and our GPU water
temperature is now four point two
degrees that'd be that bottom-left
number on the thermocouple reader and
we're at one point seven degrees for the
tank temperature for the cooler itself
so that's actually relatively warm
compared to the numbers that we were
pushing earlier before the stream and
the content where we were we posted the
upload instead of a live stream with
that a fifteen thousand to forty two
that was zero point eight degrees for
that one so that was quite a bit higher
wet 1260 megahertz in the memory now
we're gonna see some artifacting some
pieces of the car flying off but as long
as we make it over the line it's okay
and we're not gonna make it over the
line the car exploded and we died so
that's twelve sixties a bit too
ambitious for that and twelve fifty we
might twelve eighty could work it
depends on what are the straps on like
the landings for memory stability but I
don't that was such a graceful crash I
don't want to push it and have to
restart everything to reprogram all this
so what I'm gonna do is push for higher
core clocks in the GT to test and maybe
in GT one let's try setting a number
five profiles we're gonna go to eight
that's a twelve forty offset and 170
we're gonna set an extra ten megahertz
on the core and we're gonna call that
profile five which hopefully is programs
yes
and then I'm gonna try and hit that when
the current load is lower in the
benchmark I don't think I applied that
both cards five
nope I do not 180
and I try to kill times by manually if I
can tell it's it's gonna crash because
it's just such a such a pain if it fails
ungracefully
can I just do nope it's not a system32
folder so it doesn't know what that is
and that didn't seem to really affect
the score anyway so we're just gonna
leave that back on
all right
let's do this one more time nine so now
we're gonna push for slightly higher
core in that GT one has the heat turned
up turned on in the office it does
there's there's enough space in this
room where I think it just kind of
dissipates without impacting this room
temperature too much and we have AC
blasting anyway but the other night when
we were running tests the the the glass
in here had a condensation on it from
running such that we pushed our air temp
there a C down so low that there's water
condensing on my class so it's gonna be
an expensive bill for all the AC is what
I'm saying
but Linus is apparently paying for it
with all this $1 donations
okay when I hit a five up here
and like that his card got declined
okay here's a lot of tessellated stuff
so this is pretty intensive we have a
higher current draw here typically
typically I crash if I try to push the
frequency at this point and I'm gonna
push for a higher frequency right now we
might we're probably gonna get
artifacting but I don't know we might
have a stable core
so let's see what its gonna survive I
think
yes it's rice let's go down to seven
and now we need to make sure this one
makes through so this is gt2 this is
memory-intensive as I said earlier yes
their barrel ran on ellentube someone
was asking Roman was on Ellen too and he
was at a C's HQ so he might put some
higher scores I don't know he's been
he's been going for a while now he
posted like a 15,000 and called it just
validating with a smiley face just
showing off how much better he is
because that beat our score at the time
then we posted a slight a higher one
than him and he posted a higher one by a
hundred points and then he posted his
final score and I think just called it
being the jerk or something like bags
like I said there Bowers a jerk for
joining the race and ruining it for hit
Jay and myself all right so it's
surviving we're slightly higher on the
core and should I shouldn't have clocked
down yet let's go back up drop some
frames there that's gonna cost us a bit
I clocked down too early because I
thought we were closing in on the gallic
sign but actually just rotating and
let's get to the glass on hit six okay
and it might survive so this is where if
there's a crash it's typically been but
we survived
one to drop down everything for the the
CPU test so that we preserve our power
availability for CPU testing see if the
survives
well maybe if this one typically crashes
at the very end so our ice is mostly
gone now we have some more on the fridge
if we really need it our water
temperature is 2 degrees getting pretty
warm I want it to be about a 11.2 lower
and then we're at 6.8 and the reservoir
did that that might have crashed
looks like a crash yep graphics was 15
804 so that's all we really care about
that was that higher than previously
previously we were at I don't think it
was think we're fifteen thousand eight
something 886 so we're actually going
down and score now so we could use the
rest of the ice and see how that drives
the temperature down another degree or
two but that is pretty much where we're
gonna be I think for for most of the
settings we have now and uh thanks and I
think let me get through some super chat
and we'll drop drop into BIOS and I'll
walk you through all of that gamers
access add some salt your ice bass that
path yeah so it would drop us with the
salt we have it probably drop us about
it's a negative eight degrees but I'd
have to add some kind of antifreeze to
the loop I don't know if it's warming up
it might not freeze but I don't really
want to push it so uh can't go lower
than one degree that's your degree I
mean yeah man I said one to one point to
lower than 2.0 which is not lower than
zero it's not that hiss okay still got
Linus's card decline up here well I know
it's five dollars alright that was fun
got to go home and see the kids good
night everyone thanks Linus I'll send
him a poster so where is oh here we go
here's I'm trying to get through some of
the super chats chat asked five dollars
how much impact is doing this type of
content have on your regular workflow
and doesn't have a negative impact on
your income impacts on regular workflow
is very high because I mean as you saw
the the a role table is not even usable
right now we can't film a role until
this is done that's what I'm trying to
finish it tonight because we have a
giant cooler with like at this point
3040 pounds of ice and it water at this
Brian and we can't film a role there so
it puts a hold on other content we we
filmed enough ahead where we've got some
so we're good but definitely this guy
needs to be wrapped soon so I can get
back to filming like the S to review for
the divinest II review
definitely big impacts on workflow but
if we make a lot of content out of it
then it kind of just becomes part of the
normal workflow because we got like the
the build-up video that went live
earlier today you got the live stream we
got the the initial stream so we're
getting a lot out of it impact on income
I don't know it really depends like a
lot of stuff I don't plan it out that
much it's just kind of do what it seems
like
we'll make sense be fun to do and what
the the audience enjoys and you know as
long as we're not losing a lot of money
then that's fine and we're not here so
clearly because line is just threw a
bunch of $1 bills at me see we got a
check Jay's Twitter I did not check his
Twitter yeah that was from Tim Howell $2
a while ago
Kiowa hammer all five dollars and I
don't know what our means for currency
but five are thank you very much Steve
isn't the 29 t WX faster than the 790 DX
e enjoying your stream from Brazil so
like I said earlier it depends on the
application for this no but for stuff
that's core it or threat intensive
absolutely yes
seniors cheap dog $10 Steve you're my
hometown hero thank you very much
DJ e four three two one five dollars
here's an extra five dollars to make it
to 90 thank you very much
Animesh sane forty bucks
sorry we broke your wrong world record
is that what they said on the stream
that's fine
Norwegian twenty bucks this is my
first-ever donation great show thank you
very much glimpse that is from Klimt
Douglas M 499 just got here what cpu is
it
it's the 79 80 XE haha datafile 10 bucks
have you seen kin of randoms youtube
channel he has a video where he shows
how he made his system to make his own
ln2 said it cost him fourteen hundred
bucks
I have not I'll probably watch out of
curiosity though WC Kern two bucks
please call in the wine chair we did
that cut that one earlier dynamically
add $2 here's $2 so you can buy some
bits to give the lioness
we gots lavis $2 what's the average
times by 4k score 420 atti non OC
I think I will not overclocked with a
single card and times by extreme I think
I was hitting probably like 6500 points
and then we overclocked and got 7400 it
might have been 6,800 but it was 65 to
68 okay so we got a serpent to xsf five
dollars thank you serpent compared to
the previous generations performance per
dollar the r-tx launch is disappointing
is there a V bios update for the normal
28 or just the ti I'm not sure I don't
have any 20 ATV bios's at this point I
might have one but I don't think I do
let's see and you might be able to find
some actually so V BIOS updates let me
just go over this for some technical
content while we do the questions v bios
Nvidia's locked it down pretty hard
Andy has locked there's down a good
amount but you can still kind of do some
stuff so you can't really do custom V
BIOS is like you used to be able to with
Nvidia at least but you can still kind
of do it
bye-bye well special XOC bios's will
work like the ones we have but if you
take like a hex editor and you compare
the values of the original bios and then
like patched bios like if they release a
patch to change something in their bios
you can get a a comparison look at the
differences between the to find the line
where the power target changes or
whatever it is and then try and change
it in a hex editor and save it and apply
it now hopefully you're doing this with
a card I see I see more donations I need
to read hopefully if you're doing this
with a card it has to bios's because if
one dies while you're trying to flash it
then you can still recover it but if it
has one v bios there's much bigger risk
Norwegian 1000 I got that one already
from Simon good luck have fun again
thank you I'll point that again and then
we have a mark perk in $2 l TT on
YouTube it now a tweeted user link thank
you got that earlier Adam Schumann $2
Linus said you were getting salty that
was during their stream the wine show
Sam Landis $1 no message thank you
combat wombat one of the best names on
YouTube $2.00 Linus said you need that
charity ha corporal Kendall wank $2 is a
de ban me from discord
and he'll link to crashing iphone to
crash i/o banned you for crashing
iPhones the link I don't know I guess
all I can do it later cross mission five
dollars this is the most fun I've had on
YouTube since I found out about you two
calm also Linus got it well that's a
even over the numa numa song and what
are the other ones from a decade ago
leave Britney Alone because that's I
appreciate it thank you data file $5
youtubers think it is they who
influenced chat but in reality the other
way around
given the phone calls to line us and Jay
earlier yes Robert mal five dollars LD t
IRA oh yeah we got that one Neal
McDonald five dollars high from the UK
been a sub for a while I've all attacked
keep up the good work thank you I do a
couple more and then we'll see what we
can do over here
Skyler Wallace I had no idea you guys
were in North Carolina I can't believe
one of my favorite tech youtubers is
located 25 minutes for me being more
tech enthusiasm in NC thank you most
instrument by Matt $2 then preach what
Ben pre-shredded cheese I don't
understand
Oh make America okay I'm not gonna read
the rest that but it's a it's a pun I'm
gonna leave it there it's a good one but
I'm not gonna read it Todd Vance $5
awesome stream tonight look forward to
the sign poster thank you and let's do
one more
Nuria Rivera $10 you should include bit
wit and your hashtag rip in case he
catches any ideas seriously have any of
the waterblock manufacturers reached out
to provide they blocked yes give me one
second I'll bring it back over to the
camera I'll bring it over there so we do
have this one from ek unfortunately they
sent it a little too late because they
and they did sensed up really fast
there's like one or two-day shipping but
this block I'll just we'll just show it
off here because I have anyone looked at
again it came after I destroyed our
cards basically they're reclaimed well
but after I took them all apart and and
put the waterblock supremacy blocks on
them put the VR at the vram heat sinks
on man there was a lot of work that
really sucked to do that be rampant heat
sinks keep saying that after I did that
we got this
like man I'm not gonna do it all again I
thought this would probably have it
better and leave me a bit less concerned
about the pretty nice about the be
around some stuff so let's see someone
was asking out water blocks from ek and
like I said we got him in we have one
coming from alpha cool as well the plan
is to test both so I'd like to see how
they do versus each other but this is
it's a full-coverage block padding this
what it kind of sucked
he probably to use Vaseline for that
because I'm below I'm below ambient so
connotations a big concern on a big
metal plate like that we'd have to make
sure everything that has contact
anything that doesn't is coated or
something but for a normal actual
water-cooling I mean it looks like a
good block I just haven't tested it so I
don't know well find out how it does
soon in a wet bench what wTF is that
it's a water block for an RT x20 atti
so this is for the founders edition
that's not the reason this would work on
our XE ultra card because the founders
edition PCB it would not work on our
issues card because it's too tall and
it's a different PCB layout different VR
arms all that stuff so they're pretty
specific but anyway for the people
asking WTF is that do check out check
out J of course who were ripping earlier
J's to sense he does all the waterblock
stuff I mean they're like you know like
this this is one on a Titan beast that's
what it looks like installed with an
acrylic plate on it so you can kind of
see the fin stack and there the micro
fins over the core but most do you have
seen this of course okay
what-mon are you using on your test
bench some 4k acer monitor it's pretty
old I don't know it's is one of the
first 4k g-sync monitors I'm not using
g-sync of course for this but it's just
easy to haul around okay so give it
another run I guess and I'll read
through what super chats are left and
we'll see see the score gets any higher
before Connick quits on this rig but we
did beat our previous score so he ripped
jihad and successfully which is great
all right as dear bear are still helping
he hasn't yet he he has not provided any
direct assistance yet but he shipped
something to me and probably I won't get
around to it until after the next
immediate launch that recovering but I'm
hoping to and it's it'll get crazier
than what we have now so he he will be
providing some stuff but I was talking
to JT it gets to a question where you're
like okay when is it not just a funny
youtuber thin anymore I think we decided
basically exotic cool and but I think he
tried dry ice okay
we're running the test now I'm gonna
have to keep a loose eye on it
Daniel little $2.00 call Jay did that
David $2.99 thank you very much
Caleb Mackenzie $5.00 called Buster's PR
Captain Planet 150 and T thank you very
much
did you change the windows performance
settings to adjust for best performance
yes that is one of the tricks that
kingpin taught us last time
Andrew crew is $2.00 service tension
plus backup socket condensation flaw
surface tension plus back of socket
compensation flaw I don't
I need more words than that we're fine
if you're talking about our cards they
have kneadable eraser on the back of the
socket back of the core so that
insulates them we have paper towels
attempts were good and that was from
before I open the water box it's not
about that okay cool I'll get a couple
of those in a minute
oh shoot it dropped clocks but it was
stable for a second with the higher
clock here so maybe I should push memory
higher for that test that might give us
a higher score let me hit a spot check a
couple more of these orders shouts them
out while I'm looking at it
stickers and decals and a video card
poster - Guillermo in a Sacramento thank
you very much just click through them
kind of randomly like I said no
guarantee I'll hit yours but do my best
while doing that Scott from Calgary
thank you video card poster very much a
lot of those I think video card poster
from Erina and Belgium thank you
I got a hit this one if we're gonna drop
some points from that damn screw-up at
the beginning but might as well let it
finish since it hasn't crashed and like
I said we have those Ragland hoodies
finally back in stock it's it's probably
my favorite apparel that we sell out of
all of them we also have the blue print
sure it's like the one I'm wearing today
that's back in stock too so we talked a
lot of stuff right before the stream
he's gonna pick stuff up on store that
gamers Nexus done that
see if it's Rives
we got to review some of these cards too
I have some interesting thermal data on
some of the stock unmodified cards that
will be going over eventually but the
finest two reviews first and then those
we got the fan tax evolve xn from a
viewer on loan be hitting that pretty
soon so we got a lot of stuff we can
start working on as soon as this is done
and frees us from the overclocking virus
builds Wade had a pretty good point
about this too when I was in the middle
of doing all this work it crashed I told
him how yeah how frustrating it is to
get to this point where it's actually
working and functional and he said
overclocking it's like you said it you
progressively feel worse and worse as
you do it until you finally feel great I
guess if you actually if it actually
works out otherwise you just feel bad
forever but it's pretty accurate like
doing it's really cool and then you
start getting into the grind of like
fine-tuning ten megahertz increments
like I've done all night here and did
pre before the stream and that part kind
of sucks and then it's a lot of fun once
it works so totally agree one more I'll
read off on the store store Denver's
access dot net purchase from coal burn
from Illinois who picked up a poster and
a teal logo shirt thank you very much
Colburn for that all right so I'm gonna
do a bunch of super chats here fill it
with isopropyl alcohol and put dry ice
in it let's see Wow just looked at a
video about GP waterblock stuff that
looks really beautiful never thought I
would say that about tech stuff but
seriously it's cool yeah I mean water
cooling is definitely is it it's a lot
of looks involved for sure
here it's performance because we
couldn't do these anything without water
claim even without the ice bucket this
stuff got our score significantly
improved over our previous scores so
like to imagine all the blue all that
crap there doesn't exactly look
beautiful he's hey but it's it's huge on
performance side of things
then of course people like Paul and Jay
do really good-looking builds - I don't
do that though so let me walk you
through some of the parts water over
here I'm going to go through the rest of
super chats start winding down on this I
think 12 - or sorry 15,000 - 49 s
probably about our highest score so we
beat our own score which is great it's
great way to end the wow that is so much
water do you see the condensation on
that side it's a great way to end the
usable life of this bench rig check that
out so that is why we insulate
everything on these because if you like
hit that with a fan and blow it around
it would kind of suck but I think I'm
doing the sideways is that an R that is
so much water
then an elf does that look like an L to
you t.t all right so we have a lot of
condensation clearly so components for
the bench have you been curious it is
yes in fact sexy for the processor 5.1
gigahertz on the first two cores 5.0 for
the rest memory is really heavily tuned
for me someone else could do a much
better job of course but I've got the G
skill tried NZ black kit which is a 3600
CL 16 kit down to CL 15 at 4000 mega
Hertz with T falls drops we have our FC
dropped our EFI is increased so that
stuff's been mostly manually tuned
almost entirely we have ek Furious fans
which I've never used before
at 2500 rpm on both sides so that's cool
in our VR M&amp;amp;V ram that was my biggest
concern with this is if i'm coating the
the board in eraser and then taping over
it with paper towel i was really worried
about thermal insulation and getting
those components hot but because they
share a PCB with the GPU and the water
block that's on it we actually get some
spread effect where the the surrounding
components around the block are actually
lower than ambient as well and then we
have not much but a little bit and we
have the V RMS hit with fans from both
sides so this is pushing air the NOx
with 3000 rpm fan it's forcing air
through all the shop towel and hitting
the bottom V RMS and the vram excuse me
on the left half of the VRM then this
band is our exhaust pushing it that way
but this air never gets hot even when
it's benching because all the heats
really in the loop and that's clearly
getting soaked by the ice because the
loop temperature is still 4.6 which is
the highest I've been all night
and we're 3.2 for the bucket temperature
which is 3 degrees higher than well not
quite it's one point it's two point five
degrees higher than it was when I post
that first 12000 242 score so that's
what's left of our ice bucket we have a
pond pump in there that's really cold
from Richie and then we have Q DC's that
we put in here today for the CPU so we
get to 560 rads flat and that's
that's what these are so that's the
batter of the 560 I think that's a Cee
then we have the SE next to it these are
ek rads so they just so happen to fit
perfectly in the ice bucket which is
pretty great for benchmarking and that's
our rig we have an ax 1600 I for the
power supply and a fan controller as
well for the fans and that a dual pump
so that is the machine alright let's get
through some super chats so like I said
12 15 to 49 is probably bout our final
score therefore dual GPU I forget what
we hit for single what will upload that
tonight to and then we've got some super
chats here so ek drum Oy $5 gnj devour
and builds oh I need to form a Voltron
and be evil beat the evil that has
kingpin it might take all of us to do
that yes major chip hazard $2 just
bought a sine mod matte crystal and
poster wow thank you very much first of
all hugely appreciated that that does
definitely it helps the stream a lot the
crystals
we have right here I'll just pull that
one out it's got a 3d explosion - hi
graph our logo in it with like fake
prm's and stuff can you see that okay
but uh next Super chat fee 199 call me
I'm Windows incorporated tech support I
will fix you okay site called $5.00
control delete run task Explorer run new
task Explorer yeah I think it got that
earlier player won $5 would you be able
to test a Windows versus Linux benchmark
now that steam sports gaming on Linux
I'd love to at some point I'm not a
Linux expert so I'm like Wendell from
level 1 tech certainly is Rob Williams
from tech gauge he does a lot of really
good Linux benchmarking and I can
recommend his comment he's content he's
he's sort of just started on YouTube but
his website tech age comm has some good
Linux stuff in it we will eventually go
that route but it'll probably be in
one-off pieces and that's cuz all the
research a lot first I'm not a Linux
expert I built our web server with Linux
but I only not
with it once every few years to do that
Lisa Murkowski $5 could using the same
setup on the F II get even close to
these results or as a partner card the
only way to go so even with partner
cards without the mozz we've done
they're really not that different but
the difference is the the power offs
that we have so we have a vape a V bios
mod on these I don't have a V bios mode
for the EFI cards I don't know if the
actually ultra on would work on an EFI
card I'm not willing to try it because
failure would kill the card so that's
because it flashes the bios there's one
bios on it once you flash it that's it
you can flash it again if it survives
but otherwise no so we could use the
same setup it would not get the same
results unless we had a power offset as
well okay so we got a I'm going through
these one by one and I'm at a 908 p.m.
right now we're working forward we get
through them pretty quickly though so
give me a second I'll get through all
the super chats thank you for your
patience as we've been benchmarking
quick update for anyone who hasn't seen
it our single card score is like what is
it 84 something 49 something like that
and we're at a not 49 but 8400 something
and then we are at 15,000 249 for dual
card Adam the Shuman looks like a Borg
implant 2.0 talking about that EVGA
bridge earlier
Jason Kristoff 1999 is impossible to run
a script that automatically activates
the hotkeys without pushing buttons ie
okay yes so ie asking Barclays to make a
script to beat J than making Barnack Lee
sign an NDA for a year about the script
I guess he could probably it gets into
the territory where if you're using like
a Auto hockey or something that's the
way I would probably do it is that
eating CPU cycles and up that it lowers
your score more than it boosts it so you
could though in theory yes I haven't
done it though chord Martin 20 a $2
million GN is doing unboxings now why
did I open earlier it wasn't the EK
thing apparently I opened something else
earlier maybe the ice blocks I don't
know OHA NB lang
mounted patrolmen $2.00 can we get tech
Jesus plushies no current plans for that
$5.00 from South egg no no message thank
you very much so on
it's a Hall of Fame page down probably I
don't know you guys have been killing it
all night
Chad five dollars how much impact does
this type of content how it got that one
Michael Anderson SEK 50 thank you very
much no message Eric Jackson $5 snagged
an anniversary shirt while when you had
an extra stock how did it my week
probably my month well then get watch
Eric I'm glad you got one and you liked
it
the only ones we have left at this point
are mine I took a few of the shirts for
myself and and and that's about all we
have left it burns when Internet

$5.00 I like this ice bucket challenge
better it just works Michael Anderson 50
SEK den first message disappeared wanted
to say I'm playing Starcraft 2 while
watching the stream love from Sweden
well thank you Michael and I haven't
played Starcraft 2 since the dead game
jokes were going around but I used to
watch Starcraft 2 GSL gstl
I can't run Ames of some of the other
leagues but all the time I wake up at or
actually I'd stay awake until 6 or 8
a.m. to watch them because they were in
Korea now we got about 20 donations from
from Linus all in a row that I got
earlier though the site is undergoing
updates right now for 3 Michael of Fame
apparently see we're getting close to
the end of the super chat so thank you
for hanging out with me while I get
through these geo centricity $1 no
message Thank You Adam Goss $5 hey Steve
loving content especially in-depth
reviews we'll be reviewing the 9900 K
and doing a price performance comparison
with the 2700 acts yes definitely we
will definitely be working with the 900k
as soon as we have one
we got a Simon I've got you sergeant's
$81 James Fox $2 guest Linus without the
strip club
Irish jehanne till eyes what CP is Linus
he is in probably a 79 80 XE although
being him he can go of it bit harder if
you wanted to a bunch more from Linus on
our own mr. dr. chi is $1 thank you
caillou katsu ninja one down I'm getting
better at your saying your name every
stevarino and I use it again caillou
cuts to ninja one dollar what was the
last score someone in the the normal
chat said so we had 15,000 249 duel card
our previous high score which we beat
our own score was 15,000 242 J was
couple points behind us he uploaded a
new squirted a great job by Jey where
both of us are at a point where we
really can't get much more out of it
without dice or dry ice or Allan's here
or something and then single card I
don't remember exactly I can load it up
though we got a pretty high score there
too that's coming in documents and
so we were at 80 4:17 for a little bit
and then 8429 that was our single card
score where i stopped i originally
accidentally beat lioness with in eighty
four seventeen apologized for it and
then said we'd do a repeal TT special
pose or so have you got one of the video
card turn on posters during this stream
it will say hashtag repeal TT or
something to that effect
okay hey two dollars from Lowell WTF LDR
three come on Steve take that shirt off
guess that's cuz everyone's throwing
single dollar bills at has crazy local
five dollars there a tariff on Canadian
salt if there is lionesses paying a lot
of import on it right now
cattle walks one dollar Thank You Brett
Armstrong two dollars he's really
throwing three quarters at you had a
time that's true
I wonder how you kept to ninja Linus
tech tips to box good luck refunding all
these got that one earlier five dollars
from name in a different language
five dollars well pcie 3.0 x8 bottleneck
twenty et eyes we did can't thank you
for the tactical question we did content
on this and so pcie 3.0 x8 is the same
as pcie 2.0 by sixteen and I'm either a
few like a few standard changes but no
performance changes so if you look at
our envy link tests you can see some by
eight benchmarks and I think that'll
help get your answer but the answer is
basically no SLI if you're doing two by
eights in SLI or envy link and you do
not have the bridge and it's a game that
uses explicit multi-gpu which long I can
think of his ashes of the singularity
then it'll bottleneck but anything that
uses the bridge which is to say
basically all games should be fine on by
eight from what we've seen and what tech
power-ups saw as well slave us two
dollars donate one point three if you
want to donate an actual one ty USD he
saying that the Linus and then line is
proceeded to give 2.2 one dollar
donations ganga genghis $2 take off the
shirt no you guys are weird
my monkey chips steal ours rip ldt rip
JS two cents
Matthew Bower is 199 I'm helping -
this is a bad influence and $2 if ldt
tried to buy a pre-roll ad would you do
it I don't know maybe James Luther $5
gracias por la diversión esta noche I
don't I don't I don't speak Spanish
sorry brand films $1 brand films $1
Michael be $1 sorry to say $1 okay got
it
James be 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 $10 take it easy
partner
I see gamer 35 $5 here have some money
to get some food I also ordered a poster
to support you guys at GM thank you very
much $1 from Linus that was declined by
his card like us he he over drafted or
something nice shirt
got that one earlier okay stop with a
super Chancellor he threw the last them
I want to get through the rest these
aren't many left so we can get
everyone's and maybe we'll do one more
thing with this then close out Nikko
step on Linus's toes and key Jake our
data file $5 bro they're sending dollars
because they want you to deal with the
CPU on that system let's see that die in
the nude well I already deleted that one
and you can see the content on that bet
in quickly $2 please make a GN a
long-sleeve jean shirt we have
lightweight hoodies but not long-sleeve
shirt stand alone but we do have
lightweight hoodies like the Raglan one
but I have a non zip one I would put on
the store yet so you'll find that one
soon Linus card declined a brand Vega
Linus by a poster on their store have
him sign it zdg gray GN sweater winter
sweater when we have not sweaters what
we have we do have some of the winter
hoodies coming out soon ok I'm getting
almost to the bottle these but Linus
really spanned the chat Corey Holland $2
I think this counts towards ltg's
marketing budget JM just Eleuthera $10
we have to break up the LG G spam also
I'm amazed at the determination well we
beat the score is including our own so
Dave hours dealing went ahead of us as
far as my knowledge this instant but 3d
marks been down on the Hall of Fame so
I think he'll remain ahead of us though
Indrajit sin 1621 thank you very much
just bought my GN shopping list and this
will make it a nice round number could
you do an a4 sheet of stickers
I would like to tag some aircraft that's
cool with some GN goodness and have
multiple jets in mind do you own these
or have access to them legally because
if you are going to sneak out to an
airfield and tag things with my sticker
I would be a little concerned we don't
have them to a4 sheets but I mean we saw
him stand alone of course rob has two
dollars that's worth at least cord in
five dollars poster order thank you
looking forward to I said stop with the
super chance can we get a single page
with all the case benches probably post
are ordered looking forward to
representing my love for GN and LTT at
the same time on my wall cute with a
good work man thank you very much Tom
scoffs $2 almost to the end of these
what a snowflake doing on top of the
tool wall snowflake is up there as I'm
glad someone finally noticed that we put
the snowflake plushie up there I think
I'm almost through all of these but it
keeps it just scrolled down on me there
we go
and I'll have snowflake and some more
b-roll soon I'm setting up the studio at
the house to get her and so their shots
Sonya leave $5 thanks to you and
everyone for the Battle of the week
entertainment what was your first OC
probably the i7 930 the Intel Nehalem
chip I overclocked that thing I ran it
hard without really knowing it for years
two years got lucky then no degradation
didn't I definitely didn't know what I
was doing so got to start a bit late
with it with ISO 930 no fancy bios for
that really hot chip I think it was
running over a hundred fifty watts for
most of its life
that was my first overclock to answer
that question couple more here
Brian Vegas end - the signpost we got
that quad-core Punk $5.00 hey Steven
when you said you're doing fantastic I
didn't think you meant testing and
gladiatorial combat that's more or less
what we've done at this point yes zooks
$5.00 just bought a poster can't wait
for the inevitably lengthy explanation
on why it's signed by OC Jesus shade the
rapper $5 hello from Alaska hello
shade the rapper what's the rap scene
like in Alaska Drive tear $2 ordered
poster and a cube to support great
content thanks thank you very much a
couple more I think yes I'm almost
rolled down to the bottom of this and
thank you of course for all these I am
trying to get through them though so we
can finish up the content over there
Julian I am $2 have you thought about
doing a fan meetup I've thought about it
but I'm gonna stick with Linus as LTX
for now that's a great place to find me
if you're over there and then maybe
we'll do something here later what
oh yeah andrew has a good point we
actually do have a fan meetup so that's
Fred this is Jay that's I don't know why
I start with Fred and then I switch to
you through another Paulette's lioness
I've been having a great time all night
it's how you missed it how can I get the
ecstasy BIOS please give me you can
probably find out overclock net Cameron
taught Hill cent use some MC love from
Mooresville thank you very much Cameron
Scott ass 648 it's great content the
sort of the poster awesome scene you
guys are having fun in this battle it
was a lot of fun and good for the
community I think couple more get in
there okay
Vignesh two dollars do a little cold
meat up wishbone two dollars beetle
Adventure Racing is the last true test I
guess so I know that's been a bit of a
thing lately
Ferdinand philosophize ours that
overclocking made ray-tracing actual
photo over realistic at 60fps good work
enjoying the that battle week greetings
from austria greetings to you as well
for an end I want you to vitalize did I
miss it it's sort of at this point yes
15,000 249 was the score of a duel
and that's probably gonna be about it
I'll do one more walk through the system
before I tear it apart John Kruse $10
just purchased a mug thank you very much
slave Asst char our storage keeps saying
he's going to rob you I don't know what
that is is that
someone on YouTube apparently chained
potato or $5 can I get a mod Matt and a
job you can get a mod Matt I'm all I'm
all full on jobs right haha Justin OH -
I've Starcraft still the best wannabe
one game ever made I agree with you but
alas dota seems they rule these days we
got a one shoe $5 what conditioner do
you use thermo grizzly shampoo what
softens it that would probably be the EK
cry of fuel is what i use after that
slippery Johnny liners can we get a
single page with benchmarks yes so that
was the last one that's the one where I
said I would stop her you them a little
bit before that actually all right so
let's close out here final scores 8429
for one card I think it was on 5.0 for
this what's my own fuck yeah 5.1 for
first two cores that boosted our score
by 200 points / 5.0 weed 5.0 for the
remaining 16 cores graphic score was so
926 that's one card again that was not
with the AC Scarlets the other and then
our other score was a fifteen thousand
to forty nine dual card which beats our
previous scores to rip TM for that and
that one was fifteen thousand 886 which
I have to say I'm really happy with that
graphic score I know what devera has a
spike quite a bit there he's in the
sixteen thousand s now I think his CB s
course 13,000 plus we're at 12,000 428
he's on liquid nitrogen I can't really
get much more out of this and he's more
skilled so that's gonna be it for the
overclocks
I'm just curious what start temperature
at some point this will have to go off
but we're still four point six degrees
in the bucket it sells he has an 5 point
something in the reservoir so let's go
over the system parts one more time just
cuz it'll be gone after this so we might
as well walk every three everyone
through it one last time before I have
to tear it down
and this is going to be LC Oh builds
ahead says 84 wait what
84 46 not 8429 8429 Oh builders right
thank you builds wide builds were just
correct to me our best single card score
was actually higher than what I said
I'll show you in a minute I guess it was
84 46 so it was about 20 points higher
than what I said it was and I'll walk
through that in a moment
thank you builds right back if you don't
know who he is check him out actually
hardcore overclocking his YouTube
channel which is really good work does
some piece of the analysis for us as
well and we really like his content so
if you want something a bit more
in-depth than what we do on the PCB and
electrical so I'd definitely check those
out always have you plugged his channel
on his work so here's here's a final
walkthrough
alright go through right to left my
right to my left what we have is a
Rubbermaid bucket that I bought the
hardware store when I asked them where
was I in fact did not tell them what I
was planning to do with it because I
think that would have confused everybody
and we switched to that's really cold
two to five sixty radiators instead of
the original three whatever I had it was
at 360 a head yes fat 360 Thermaltake
Rainier the reason I did this
so it's bigger but also because it's
less dense it's not as thick it's easier
for this pump underneath to circulates
on the water through it I shouldn't be
doing that towards the system and
getting the warm water away from the
radiator so that was why we switched
this large one also they fit really
nicely like that other ones another 560
it's thinner for the GPUs I've got a lot
of drip and a lot of condensation all
the way down the tubes up into the bench
and so that's our tubing we have EK z mt
tubing i chose this because it's it's
better insulated so condensation takes
longer to form and it keeps the cold in
a bit longer you can see these clear
tubes are how well you can see it on
camera but they have a lot more drip on
them
then there's EMT 2 and then for the
bench we have an EVGA X 299 dark board
our CP is running pretty hot right now
at 41 degrees and that's because we
don't have enough ice in there anymore
but we're not been cheating or extranet
dark could do the exercise I was some
time for the 290 arc but I didn't do it
for this one
g.skill trying to see memory at 4000
megahertz see all 15 tighter timings all
the way down the line for the most part
we have furious car fans for these VRAM
VRAM you have to eat EK nacht to a fans
for the front in the back forcing air
through in a tunnel fashion you jxe
ultra asus strix 2080 TI and those both
have shunt mods on them so they have
liquid metal on the shunt need to clean
that off later for the power we have a
Corsair a X 1600 eye and then on the
front end I was big stupid wood block we
put together that's clance to the table
that's how kind of Jerry rigs this is we
have a large ek reservoir an ek dual
pump which has been great because a huge
loop so needs to help we have an EK pump
reservoir combo that's for the cpu and
it's like frozen at this point and then
we have I think that's it
I think that covers all the parts so
that's our bench needs to be taken apart
and chilled out at this point does it
leak no it actually does not so I think
that pretty much wraps it all up let's
see
where is builds right got it
so 84 46 that's what I said we got that
there so that score was eight thousand
nine and then twelve thousand to twenty
seven for the CPU score so it actually
was lower so I could push this higher by
200 points on the CPU with the current
overclock but I'm not gonna do it right
now
so give us some Headroom if we need to
come back but that's gonna be it so like
I said store that Cameron taxes down
that if you want to help us out that's
the best way to do it for the streams
