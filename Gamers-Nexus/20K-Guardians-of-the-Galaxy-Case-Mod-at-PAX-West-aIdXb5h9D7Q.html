$20,000 assist on that they're giving
away in part with make-a-wish Foundation
here at PAX West 2017 we just had a
chance to check it out and have some
cool b-roll of it
this system was contributed to by a
number of companies issues being the
main one they're here showing it off
using the Maximus 9 extreme motherboard
but also got to give a big shout-out to
PC junkie mods and blue horse studios
who did the modification work
introducing the very cool guardians of
the galaxy theme with little Groot
little groots up there there's a tape
deck with the awesome mix of volume
water to is in it which is of course a
reference to the movie it's a pretty
cool stuff before we get into that this
is coverage is brought to you by our
patreon backers at patreon.com slash
gamers Nexus if you'd like to help us
directly with this type of reporting you
can get involved there you can even join
us on discord to talk with the GN
members and other members of the
community alternatively check out gamers
access squarespace.com to pick up a
shirt basically the component layout I
was going to walk you all through it is
they've got to 1080 eyes they are
presiding cards to their liquid-cooled
for open loop and those have I think a
mirror to RGB effect on the top those
hook into the rest of the open loop
which cools a 70 700 K which is again on
the Maximus 9 board that Maximus 9 board
has a full cover or a mono block on it
covering the BRM and the CPU so there's
full coverage on all the hot components
and then outside of that they're running
a bunch of corsair parts for the fans
and the psu in the memory and then primo
chill parts for the liquid cooling so
that'd be your tubing and i think
they've got a 240 and a 360 rat on there
as well core shares got 32 gigabytes of
vengeance RGB LED memory in the system
and then they also have an HX 1000 power
supply in there again powering the to
1080i poseidon's which are of course in
sli the cool part though is the mod so
the mod originally was a Corsair I think
460 x case which is one of their crystal
series cases that we showed at Computex
or CES a year or two ago so that you
can't even recognize it anymore it's
been completely overhauled the front of
it
is an old cassette player it does not
work unfortunately but it looks like one
and it's got an actual functional
cassette player door that opens you can
pull the tape out so that's the front of
the case and then the top of it is
mostly just a clear glass so you can see
into the components and there's a groove
on top with two buttons that do not
press buttons one of which is I think
power I'm not sure what the other one
does but there are two buttons up there
in terms of components if you're adding
it up in your head going $18,000 I can
build a dual 1080i and 7700 case it's
number way cheaper than that the reason
is because case mods are not free and
the liquid cooling components aren't
either so it's pretty expensive to get
all those parts together add up all the
MSRP plus the cost of the mod you arrive
to that number pretty easily so a pretty
cool project we wanted to highlight it
because case mods are always cool and
seen them at PAX is just especially
interesting we don't see a ton here we
see the mosaic copy tech so there you
have it that's the heat winning and so
far the only mod we've seen for the show
and that one goes to a good cause so
basically the idea I think they're doing
a make a donation to make a wish and
then you get entered into the raffle
something to that effect
we'll try and leave a link below if you
want to get involved with that and it's
basically a raffle for a good cause
everything the person who gets drawn
gets the system it's a pretty cool stuff
wanted to highlight it as always you can
subscribe for more coverage from PAX
West and other shows that we go to thank
you for watching patreon.com such game
as an accent stomps out directly I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
