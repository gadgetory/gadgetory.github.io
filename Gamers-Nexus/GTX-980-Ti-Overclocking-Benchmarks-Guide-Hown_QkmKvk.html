next astana and today we're talking
about overclocking the new gtx 980ti
this is a maxwell card on the GM 200 GPU
I've already got a review online from
yesterday or the day before where we
talked about the card it's performance
on the whole but we're doing here is
looking strictly at overclocking and
Maxwell over clocks a bit differently
from previous architectures primarily
Maxwell introduces something called
power percent target and this is the
percentage of watts over the native
wattage provided to the card that you're
allowing for overclocking so in in the
case of GM 200 and in the case of the
gtx 980ti which is what we're looking at
here the power percent targets max
setting is a hundred and ten percent
other cards will allow 120 percent even
125 percent in the case of some gtx 960
s but for the reference card we're stuck
at 110 so we can set it to 110 that
allows an additional 10 percent of power
over the native power provided so the GM
200 that's on the 980ti has the same
memory subsystem the same architecture
as every other gen 2 maxwell card
meaning after the 750ti launch and that
would include the gtx 980 and the titan
axe the titan act uses the GM 200 GPU
the 980 uses the GM 204 960 is GM 206 in
terms of overclocking it's the same idea
for all of them but your results will be
different
the 980 for instance I can push a bit
higher than the 980ti
but the performance obviously is much
greater with the 980ti so we got about a
19% performance gain as you'll see in
charts momentarily from the overclock
and I was able to push the base clock
and boost clock 14 to about 14 44
megahertz which is 40% higher than the
native clock rate the native clock rate
of the gtx 980ti
is 1,000 megahertz and boost is only
1075 megahertz so nothing too impressive
stock but after overclocking we can
easily push pretty close to 1500 I did
lose stability once we started hitting
about 1450 though and we'll talk about
that momentarily
so what you're looking at right now is a
chart showing our ink
mental jumps to the clock rate the
voltage things like that and we do this
in a way that's it's very specific for
test methodology purposes I set the
memory offset to only plus 500 megahertz
you could easily set this to much higher
potential you hundred megahertz or more
but we are more focused on the core
clock for overclocking in this instance
so I've sort of ignored the memory clock
we set it to something that's decent but
not the maximum available voltage was
maxed out immediately and then we just
increment the core clock slowly voltage
pushes about one point one eight seven
volts on the gtx 980ti reference card
and it is thermally limited with the
reference cooler so we'll see much
better results once we move to action
market coolers liquid cooler seems like
that as the the board partners come out
with their own cards for our
overclocking methodology we move things
slowly for the core clock it starts out
with bigger jumps like 25 megahertz at a
time and then once we find instability
that would be in the form of visual
artifacts like red flickering or texture
tearing or we find a driver crash which
happens frequently when you're
overclocking then it's time to step it
back down so I do two passes of
endurance testing one is a very quick
five-minute check just to see if there's
any artifacting or failure of the
drivers and then if that's fine I move
forward and do the next step in the
frequency and we just keep repeating
that until a point at which the first
five-minute past shows a failure and
then it's time to step it back down I'll
step it down a bit and then do two tests
the first is the five-minute pass the
second one is a long endurance test 20
to 30 minutes using msi combustor which
is just firm re skinned it pushes about
a hundred percent GP load to the GPU
even the gtx 980ti
and that should provoke a failure if it
doesn't provoke a failure then we found
our stable clock rate in the case of
this the offset was about 255 megahertz
so it's just below what the Titan X is
generally capable of that tends to push
1450 to megahertz or somewhere in that
range
this card pushes about fourteen forty
four megahertz so very close and the gtx
980ti and Titan X are only different in
their core count
so the Ti has 28 16 cores in the
gix has 30 72 course that's where your
major differences in performance pre
overclocked after overclocking as you
see in these charts the Titan X is
actually left behind a little bit by the
gtx 980ti and we see at 19 percent
performance jump over the 980 i base so
it's a pretty big gain it's a massive
gain over the 980 non ti card and it's
reasonable over the tight neck so if
you're willing to overclock you can push
your gtx 980ti beyond the
thousand-dollar tight necks for
performance which is big that's a big
deal
note that overclocking over long terms
can cause damage to the semiconductor
just extra heat is not great for it so
you'll really want to adventure with
this outside of the reference cooler
which is what we have here the card is
thermally constricted with the reference
cooler it's pushed completely to its
limits EVGA has got a liquid version
coming out I believe Asus might have a
liquid version coming out and there's
all kinds of aftermarket options from
MSI they're doing a liquid cooler as
well partnered with Corsair so plenty of
options for 980ti overclocking it is
definitely worth your time to try it out
do be careful when you're doing the
clock right stepping because you can
cause damage to the device by
overclocking it so just do it
incrementally be careful and do five
minute and then endurance passes and
check for instability I would also
recommend logging the temperatures to
make sure the temperature is within the
safe threshold this should not exceed 92
Celsius ever it is designed to thermally
shutdown when it hits that temperature
but you want to be below that anyway
probably in the 80s out of max so that
is the overclocking guide for the 980ti
pretty impressive stuff
definitely a 19% gain for performance is
a big deal and is worth trying if you
have a 980ti check out our patreon page
linked at the end of this video and the
end slate as well as the 92 TI review if
you haven't seen that already and i've
got some cool Witcher content all that
stuff on the channel do check out the
channel for more information subscribe
as always and for those who are posting
comments on the previous video I do read
most the comments so it's it's great to
hear your outreach and hear feedback
some people were saying that they wish
they could donate to the patreon page
but they just can't that's totally fine
the best thing you can do for us anyway
is to share the content tell
people doubt us and if you like it then
leave a comment or it like or something
like that I will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
