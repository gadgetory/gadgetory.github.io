dotnet and this is our first video
review we actually have hundreds of
article reviews on our website that's a
gamers nexus net if you did not catch
that earlier so what better game to
start video reviews with an aurochs must
die it's just it's so simple but it's so
crazy awesome at the same time and the
game has gotten a lot of attention from
us over the past week yes we did have
early access to it for pc so if you go
to our youtube channel you will see a
couple of videos already i will be
uploading more still and maybe a few
walkthroughs for some of the more
difficult levels that said Orcs Must Die
is a really simple game all you do is
defend your rift your rift is
essentially the what you're defending in
the tower defense game which is going to
be the very end of the level as orcs go
into it is actually going to lead to
your doom so you want to keep them out
of there the rift is just a big blue
shiny ball of magic and this magic as
far as the story goes which isn't hugely
important in a tower defense game but
the story just says that the risks are
the source of magic in the world and we
as the war mage and that is our that is
our class by the way a war mage we must
close off these rifts and make sure that
the works do not proceed through them
and destroy the villages and hamlets of
whatever our world is now of course in
the story this leads to the inevitable
removal of magic I won't spoil too much
but that's just story it's not really
going to affect the game too much so
keep it works out of the rift that's
your first objective and really your
only objective other than maybe not die
so as orbs go in you do lose these
things called rift points which are
essentially how many orcs are allowed to
go through the wrist before you lose the
level and each level has a couple some
of them have a couple different doors
that works and come in through which
really encourages complexity and
encourages your trap design so if they
can come in from two sides and have two
different hallways that means one
hallway might be better for example too
late dozens of arrow traps in and just
as the orange move through they get shot
to ribbons by arrow traps another
hallway might be better for depending on
the construction of the hallway might be
better for ceiling mounted
mashing traps that smash them as the
floor so pretty cool stuff now there are
a lot of traps I don't know the exact
number I can check that for you but it's
a the trap so sadly are relatively
underpowered for the most part that you
will end up using the same four or five
traps throughout the entire game that's
what I found out anyway and as you
unlock more traps you unlock one each
level as you unlock more you'll find
that some of them are more or less
effective and never used some of the
older ones again which to me is really
sad because when i saw this game i was
hoping that trap combos would be highly
encouraged by more points or more
something to reward the player with for
example comboing maybe i don't know a
steam trap that launches or it's into
the air 10 feet for example with a
ceiling mashing trap that smashes them
back down into the floor and kills them
or something to that extent that's kind
of cool and and perpetually amusing for
you to watch as a player but they're not
really rewarded in the way I want so
it's normally more effective to just use
for example this is the staple trap for
the whole game tar pits which slow works
down immensely so you put tar pits at
the entrance of the door then you put
archers up on a cliff which aren't
really traps they call it Guardians but
they're in your trap book and then the
archers can shoot that works in the tar
pit as they're slow slowed down and you
can also use explosive barrels in the
middle there which are basically powder
kegs the archers will shoot that on
occasion just from crossfire and that
will kill all the words it's a really
boring way to win the game
and unfortunately it does work on most
levels but if you're the kind of person
that can look past those types of combos
and make yourself use new combos and new
trap groupings then pray for you you
will love this game if you're the kind
of person who once you figure that you
figure out an overpowered or cheesy
strategy you may have trouble getting
through this game without beating
yourself in the head a few times for
using the same tactics over and over now
that said the level design is pretty
fluid and very very good you can each
level is designed to encourage as many
trap types as possible despite
everything I just said some of them are
very open so that does lend itself to
more archers or guardians but the ones
that are closed and condensed and all
hallways and typical traditional
stereotypical casa castles there you go
that was a lot of words that mean the
same thing right there just basically
castles and hallways are my favorite for
traps because they really really push
you to do new things that are cooler and
you'll see in some of our gameplay
videos we have stuff like swinging maces
coming from the ceilings that are
synchronized or even asynchronous
combined with things like I don't know
maybe arrow traps in the walls so any
orgs that get past the swinging maces
will get shot up by arrow traps and then
you can have spike traps in the floor
that poison them so if they get past
those arrow traps they will be poisoned
and then die by the time they get to the
rift and all awesome stuff like that so
some more sweet stuff about this game
the art style and art direction is
amazing it's just normally I'm not a
huge fan of cartoony games and this game
is cartoony but not to the extent that
wow is for example it's really Orcs Must
Die is more of a cell shaded comic book
cartoon style which i think is just
awesome because you don't see a lot of
that even though a lot of game companies
have done that kind of art style orcs
must die just really takes it to a new
level and really puts you in this
fantasy world and in this more of a
fantasy comic book really so our
directions awesome the action is very
very fast-paced so this is a tower
defense game mixed with hack and slash
or hack and
shooter I guess because you do have a
crossbow if you are a fan of hacking /
or of games were using magic and
crossbows and spells to kill things you
will probably like orcs must die if
you're a fan of strategy and powered
events you will probably like or it's
must die if you sort of like both of
those you will love orcs must die that's
just how they designed it and I think
it's brilliant personally because then
they get to genres and tower defense is
sort of a smaller genre in comparison
and hack and slash is more of a blanket
one so they really really tried to
appeal to everyone there and I do it in
a way that combines and doesn't feel
forced or sloppy so that is great on
them huge props for that the
replayability is another fantastic
fantastic element in this game they do
have two modes they have an apprentice
mode which is essentially beginner or
easy and they have war mage which is
normal or medium and those you know
their normal more modes there's nothing
nothing special about them at all but
you do unlock nightmare mode at the end
and normally guys I'm the type of person
that never replays a game after I beat
if I beat it I'm just I'm done that's it
I don't want to see it again unless it's
multiplayer or something but this game I
actually did go back into nightmare mode
and start playing it again and it is a
lot harder of course the reason I went
back is because as you go through the
game the first time as long as you don't
force yourself to restart every level
over and over you will learn new traps
and you or a new trap combos and new
effective ways to kill or so and it's
all about efficiency in this game how
rapidly you kill ores so as you learn
those throughout the game you really
want to go back and try those initial
levels over again which you can do in
media mode but might as well just do it
in nightmare mode and get more points
and more kills and more awesome in
general so that's why i'm replaying this
game because i can reuse those new
combos i learned and that's what I love
about it so replayability is
huge in this great great job on robot
entertainment for that more concerns I
have as I was sort of saying many of the
traps are useless or very very cost
inefficient so you might if you want to
do trap combos that are like I was
talking about like a steam trap blasting
aurochs into the air and then shooting
them off over a cliff into lava with a
master trap or even in one of the
earlier levels I had set up a spring
trap which pops up from the floor and
springs them on sort of an arched angle
towards wherever you face the trap I set
one of those up and it shot them over an
acid pick and only want to shoot them in
it but I was shooting them over it onto
another one of those that shot them back
and then they shot back and landed on
the first one and shot back over again
and then I spilled I put spike trash
around its origin mr. bounced a rag doll
too much they'd hit a spike trap and
died so it was a lot of fun but I could
have killed them way faster just by
doing era walls or Archer traps or
explosive barrels so really not a ton of
encouragement to do fun stuff like that
especially since those fun setups
normally take longer and taking longer
does take off your points the faster you
are the more efficient you are the more
points you get the more upgrades you get
and on that note upgrades in this game
are sort of lame and sort of let down
really if I'm honest there's essentially
just as cheaper traps or slightly
stronger traps nothing super innovative
like I would have loved to see the wall
blades upgrade to be visually different
a new model or something to that extent
when i upgraded them but alas they were
not that special they were just slightly
more effective and the same goes for
almost everything else they might be
have a slight stylized difference very
slight but known not really any new
models or any new effects from them
other than maybe more damage essentially
you can get poisoned but it's basically
all just comes down to more damage so
those were kind of this
there is no level editor either so once
you finish the game and if you play
nightmare mode once you finish that
you're done that's maybe so it took me
nine hours to finish the game on medium
mode with restarting the levels multiple
times over and over because I wanted to
get the perfect score or the best score
I could so nine hours is probably going
to be the average if you're like I am if
you're a fast player and you just want
to get through it or you're incredibly
talented of these games then it will
probably take you i would guess seven to
eight hours and if you're going to
replay you probably get probably 15
max's around is around where you taper
off there so i'd say 15 max on the
outlier end so level editors would
really free that up and make it so you
could add a lot more they did say
there's some discussion but no plans of
release yet and I guess really one of my
final complaints is probably no
freestyle mode I wish you could just go
play with no time limit and with endless
waves of Oryx coming in on all the basic
levels just no objective really
obviously you know maybe have no rift
points that way you just like Oryx go
through and not have any penalty and not
lose because I would love a freestyle
mode to set up traps so they can just
kill or works on the coolest ways
possible even if it takes forever to
kill them you know because it's a lot of
fun to watch those traps work and the
art style really makes it even more fun
to watch the word die as horrible as
that sound but it's just missing a few
core elements that I would have really
loved to see in this type of game that
does not mean it's bad game there's a
very very good game and there are lots
of levels probably 23 I think I counted
maybe 24 somewhere around there so lots
of levels lots of replayability great
gameplay mechanics
general fluid level design fast-paced
action and all that great stuff that you
want in a game the only reason you would
not like it I would say is if you are an
orc but beyond that it is a pretty great
game especially for 15 bucks you get a
minimum of eight or so hours and maybe
probably in a max of fifteen to twenty
if you really really replay it heavily I
would say much more if there were a
beast out loud but alas there is none
maybe DLC my wish will be granted you'll
see anyway orcs must die is available
now for xbla and for PC so check that
out we will have a written review up for
those who for some reason want to see
even more about this game and I do not
blend you because it is pretty awesome I
would say check out the demo there is a
demo available so play it if you don't
like it in their problem you didn't
waste any money if you do like it then
