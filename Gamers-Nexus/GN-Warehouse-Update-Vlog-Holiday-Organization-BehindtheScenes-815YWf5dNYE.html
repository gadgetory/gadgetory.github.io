shelves this is gonna be like Kitchen
Nightmares except with gamers Nexus and
the fulfillment and storage facility for
our store what we're doing is upgrading
it because currently this is our shirt
storage system and you can see that most
of the bins actually a lot of them are
completely empty so first of all thank
you you all clear this out for the Black
Friday and Cyber Monday sale really
helpful it's what allows us to remain
distant from manufacturers to keep our
journalistic integrity and keep the
critical approach to product so in
stores really important for that because
it allows us to be more independent in
our finances but we do have a bit of a
problem in that the story's gotten
really popular so it's a good problem to
have but we do need to upgrade the
storage facility and how fulfilment gets
handled and so what you're gonna see
today is going through here and problem
solving so kind of fun there yes so we
need to really upgrade the system I
think what we're gonna start with is
probably clear off the shelf behind me
to my left there's like the Raglan
hoodies are extremely popular but
they're kind of they don't quite fit in
these so we keep them in boxes on the
floor and it's all really organized and
it works really well but we can improve
it and that's part of the fun of what we
do on the channel so that's what we're
doing and I mean other that I'll just
one more time say thank you again for
ordering so much stuff during the Black
Friday and Cyber Monday sale because it
is incredible support to the point that
just the other day I turned down an ad
that I thought was slimy and we can do
that because we have financial
independence and thanks to viewers so
thank you for that let's get started
with upgrading distribution center
so for this this this kind of work is
actually really fun for me
organizational and and sort of like
figuring out spatially where you can fit
as much stuff as possible because if you
saw the house we came from we managed to
store as much stuff as is in the larger
present the office we work out of in
that house I don't know how we did it
but it was fun doing it so we're gonna
try and do that in a more effective
fashion here and I think what we're
gonna start with is trying to probably
figure out we bought a bunch of bins and
shelves and things like that from a
local hardware store so we're gonna try
and figure out how to best deploy those
to store things like the these are going
out soon because these are the foil
shirts the limited edition shirts so
these are already sold but we need to
find a good solution for storing things
like the larger hoodies like the winter
weather hoodies and the pullover hoodies
things like that because those take a
lot of space and and we have some good
storage solutions now for those so let's
I guess let's get started on
reorganizing all this stuff and
hopefully find a good way to optimize
the story
so far we've relocated several a couple
of shelves to make more efficient use of
this floor space and that includes just
shifting them around and kind of mid
maxing every every square foot we can
here I'm just going through and doing a
safety check on all the bolts on this
shelf because we installed it a while
ago and it's time to just do a check on
it because you know this stuff gets used
every day it's going getting a lot of
torque on it all right so we just kind
of finished the distribution area so our
distributors stand about here and he's
got now all the packing materials here
just so we have like all the GM stuff
kind of in one area and then the boxes
we use for if you order like a for
example a poster and a mug or shirt
something like that we've got those here
than larger medium small packing paper
is extremely easy to access the bed to
previously we pull it off the top and
crumple it so that's way better of a
system which is like pulling off the
folded papers and then pulling one out
so that will speed things up
significantly
easy access envelopes for the t-shirt
shipments we have the poster tubes down
here so there's the to skew if you
bought two posters a lot of them are
prepackaged and they're one SKU by one
poster can stick them in there and so we
need to finalize kind of the actual
packing table that needs to be cleaned
off and that was still but then off to
the other side and behind the camera
there's some other cool improvements so
like we stuck the hoodies in these bins
these large stackable bins that we
picked up from a local hardware store so
there's the pullover hoodie and then we
also have the zipper hoodies stacked in
a separate
just vertical stack of bins so really
easy to access those as well that'll
speed things up significantly it's all
about efficiency improvements because
previously these were all folded into
each other so to get one out you have to
take out the whole stack from the shelf
behind me and then unfold them pull the
shirt out and then pack it and then put
everything back so big improvement there
so the Raglan hoodies are now also in
stackable the same black stackable bins
that we had for the other hoodies so we
just put those in and kind of like I
don't know cannon style they're sticking
out just kind of reach down and grab the
appropriate size stick it in the order
that's good to go so that was also a big
improvement for these ones which you can
pick up on store cameras XS necks
they're really cool and they're very
popular so that was much more accessible
the zipper ones are there we have the
mugs here so the ceramic coffee mugs are
pretty easy to pull out as well and we
just act much of those all at once so
you want to pick one up we also have the
beer glasses here so the cobalt blue
glasses all the drink wears next to each
other which makes a lot of sense and
then we have the blue and white mouse
pads here we're getting the black and
blue in at some point so let's go over
here somewhere easy pull boxes for
keychains better in there and for the
medium GN crystals and a large GN
crystals all next to each other so those
are also much faster to get access to
and all next to each other so it makes a
lot of sense logistically to keep all
those here and then the t-shirts are
where they were before so
and posters are up there so that's the
that's the upgrade for this part of
distribution now we need to work on
just overall bulk storage and things
like incoming shipments stuff like that
mod mats are always a question mark too
because these are very large and bulky
required special parameters to do it
sorry to work on building some shelves
and get the rest of the storage solution
sorted out but we happy with how the
shipping area came together now we're
moving on to the more difficult room to
conquer which is going to be storage and
we already built one shelf previously
off-camera so we've ruined the aesthetic
it used to be just all on the floor but
now only 95 percent of the stuff is on
the floor so we're gonna build shelves
and figure out a storage solution kind
of similar to our storage room in the
office and hopefully just get everything
really nicely organized for overstock
and for product organization and things
like that so time to build five more of
these shelves which are not fun to build
there's gonna be a big jump in the
time-lapse and we just want to get work
done so we have three of the shelves in
here we have two more sort of off stop
behind the camera off the sides of
camera and there's a lot of inventory to
deal with so I don't know like these are
these are our mouse pads so this is bars
of blue and white mouse pad we just got
these in a forest the new blue and gray
two-tone shirts so those just came in
and there's a lot of these eyes on the
shelves probably why we did this today
and they are also on this tour come on
let's pick one up but so we kind of have
a home for those two for the most part
we have some of our old school like Gian
original logo shirts down here we have a
bunch of the crystals the 3d tear down
cubes over there and then for the rest I
mean packing materials so tape storage
cart posters so view I've seen our video
card and madami posters on the store
that's what those are so just been
organizing everything at this point
and we still have a couple boxes
obviously like just more of the 2-tone
shirt and bugs mugs and then twos for
the posters it's getting pretty clean
there's not a lot more left that needs
to be done and everything should be a
lot more efficient it's just a matter of
sort of optimizing where the stuff goes
on the shelves at this point so if
nothing else all this stuff today should
show that when you're supporting us
buying through the store through store
decades next assignment you are
supporting two small businesses because
I mean we just built all these shelves
it's not like it's some massive
gigantic operation so some behind the
scenes for you but as always thank you
for your support and otherwise you can
subscribe for more go to store like
Aaron's Nexus dotnet to pick something
up from this place
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
