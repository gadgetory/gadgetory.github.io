significantly since we defined its
naming scheme in 2014 since then the
company has expanded into SSDs has
reduced rpm on some WD blue drives and
has all that killed the Western Digital
green series drive today we're defining
the differences between WD blue black
red and purple hard drives and I'm
looking into the new WD green blue and
black SSDs every now and then we do a
naming convention content to go through
manufacturers and their numerous names
that don't always make a whole lot of
sense like the msi video we did not want
to go and the h1 prior to that today
we're focusing on WD and the rainbow of
colors for hard drives again red blue
black green purple for the most part and
then some of the same for SSDs Seagate
has another hard drive vendor uses a
similar naming scheme but there's all
creature name so Skyhawk iron wolf and
barracuda would be theirs look at those
in the future this content by the way
has already been published on the
website so if you want the tables that
were to be talking through here you can
hit the link in the description below
for the full article where Eric Hamilton
has done all the legwork to define these
differences the briefest overview
possible of each Drive is that WD purple
probably the least known of all of these
is used for meant to be used for
surveillance systems WD red is meant to
be used for network attached storage or
raid configurations within at your
desktop and then WD blue is kind of a
mainstream Drive and WD black is the
mainstream posh one it's a little bit
higher end than the mainstream drives
but we'll talk about these specific
differences as we go through them now
when it comes to hard drives you can
still use these pretty much however you
want you could use WD red as a
standalone Drive in your system if you
wanted to even though it's meant to be
used in a raid you could use WD purple
as your game storage drive and he really
wanted to so there's no hard limitation
to what these can do it's just where
they're geared towards and what
technologies are inside of the drives
how the controller is configured things
like that there was a brief period that
some folks may remember where WD Reds
were a better buy than WD blues because
they were the same rpm same capacity and
in some cases we're cheaper that's not
really something that exists anymore but
it shows that if you do some digging and
you
don't need exactly the feature set in a
particular Drive you could get away with
using one of the other ones often for
cheaper or at a greater capacity than
might be available in the whatever
series you were originally hoping to buy
WD blue is the most common Western
Digital Drive that we recommend for
gaming storage alongside Seagate's
alternatives but we do so carefully with
the WD blues these days the previous WD
green line has been consumed by WD blue
it's dead for hard drives you won't find
WD green anymore and that means that
Western Digital now offers both 5400 rpm
and 7200 rpm WD blue drives at one
terabyte and up it is technically a 500
gigabyte capacity but those are being
phased out everywhere because the
platter density doesn't much make sense
for 500 gigabytes these days so we need
blue at 7200 rpm is what we'd recommend
for most game storage or higher density
media like RAW files but you'll need to
be sure that you're not act as a heli
behind a 5400 rpm variants because they
exist again in several capacities the
one terabyte WD blue Drive at 7200 rpm
is sort of as far as Western Digital
offerings the go-to for gaming storage
we would recommend the archiving your
games there rather than a 5400 rpm Drive
at a higher capacity because the speed
difference is noticeable particularly
with certain types of media and then as
for potential downsides the blue drives
really only lack a few features one of
them is the vibration protection which
the usefulness of that is sort of
debatable unless you really have the on
off times and needs a longer service
life of a WD black drive and then there
is time limited error recovery or TL er
that is also not found on WD blue so if
that's something you specifically want
don't buy a blue as for capacities the
7200 rpm version is limited to one
terabyte so if you want more than that
you're going to have to go to WD black
unless you're okay with getting the 2
terabyte and higher 5400 rpm Drive which
we generally would not recommend for
gaming storage or for any type of media
that needs to be accessed more quickly
now for long-term archival storage it's
just fine the more noticeable difference
is the 2 year warranty on the WD blue
drives and the fact that they're
significantly cheaper per gigabytes as
nwv black at around $50 for one terabyte
of
200 rpm versus 1 terabyte 7200 rpm black
for $77 so you've got a $27 gap there WG
Blue is available up to 6 terabytes for
$200 but these capacities only spin at
5400 rpm again are for both storage the
WD blue drives have historically used
Marvell controllers and then Samsung
chips for the cash on those drives
getting into WD black now the difference
again 5-year warranty out the gate is
the biggest most noticeable one and then
they primarily differentiate themselves
in speed so they're all 7200 rpm from
500 gigabytes up to 6 terabytes and the
six terabyte model was just sort of the
flagship of these WD black drives has a
higher amount of platters in it so it's
5 platters at one point 2 terabytes each
which is how you get your 6 terabytes
give or take and the black drive also
has 10 total read or write heads in it
and that maximizes the data density per
platter and it also minimizes the travel
required of the heads in the unit the
previous WD black 4 terabyte drive had
half the D Ram cache as the current 128
megabytes with the cash provided by Nana
na nya accompanied by a dual-core
controller from LSI or what's left of
them anyway
WD black folks is less on noise and WD
blue but does include vibration
protection features with that 5 year
warranty the only two hard drives left
the WD red drives are meant for nasty
usage so your network-attached storage
we actually need three WD red 2 terabyte
drives are a couple years old now in
raid 5 in our render machine which we
showed when we were rebuilding the thin
and they've been great for that kind of
usage the largest capacity WD red is 8
terabytes at $330 and the 8 terabyte
models interestingly use helium to seal
them rather than air there's a lot
heavier and so using helium means that
they can fit an additional 1.2 terabyte
platter within the chassis of the hard
drive totaling at 7 platters which also
encounter reduced resistance because
it's spinning through helium rather than
spinning through air this features only
on a few of the WD red drives like the a
terabyte model and in general is useful
because lower friction from our
resistance means lower heat and
consequently reduce power draw the Helio
CL Tech is only in that a terabyte unit
and other specs of WD red drives
includes significantly faster load and
unload cycle ratings I've seen it an
hour table that we have on the site
we're hopefully on the screen now and
they've also got better service life
expected over there alternatives from WD
they terabyte read drives have fourteen
read and write heads as opposed to for
example the six terabyte black drives
with ten another lfi controller within
them and 128 megabytes of cache WD red
drives also critically have some error
recovery for raid configurations which
is important if you actually want to use
a raid and they have Nats we're included
and a three year warranty so a bit
better than blue in that regard they do
tend to spin a bit slower though
depending again on which blue you're
looking at so that we use WD purple
which is all that's left this is the one
that's meant for survelliance is again
the least popular so as a surveillance
drive it is of course going to be
running writes pretty much non-stop
doesn't have much other purpose in life
than running writes for whatever camera
system it's configured to work with and
that means mostly steady-state runtimes
and as such there's custom firmware and
caching built to handle those non-stop
right WD purple drives have an
annualized workload of 180 terabytes per
year backed by a three-year warranty
because these drives write non-stop and
then overwrite footage as they go this
rating is critical for the nearly 100%
of times for security purposes the
drives also used something WD calls all
frame technology which theoretically
reduces pixelation and frame loss and
video capture so that's not our
specialty so we can't really count on
how well it works
TL ER and 80 a streaming command sets
are also supported in the WD purple
drives pricing of WD purple is
comparable to other Zen WDS lineup with
four terabytes priced at $135
moving on to Western Digital SSDs that
we see a parallel arrangement of the
drive colors to the hard drive
counterparts Green is the low end blue
is the mainstream market and black is
sort of the performance market and it's
currently pre-order only so we have an
act
test one of the black as a sea chest yet
the pricing for these is also in the
same hierarchy green blue black with WD
green starting out about $75 for 240
gigabytes blue filling the mid-range
market one terabyte for $260 or 250
gigabytes for $85 and then the W black
SSDs on pre-order for $200 at 512
gigabytes the WD green SSD is a dram
list configuration on 15 nanometer TL
seen and supported by SMI controllers
the SSD is rated only for 37,000 IOPS
for K read and 63,000 to 4k write
significantly slower than most
competition on the market and falling
into WDS weak points which is SSD
competitive price positioning vs.
performance because it is a heavily
saturated market at this point that we
be blue uses the SanDisk X 400 as a
foundation but with custom firmware and
different drive capacities on SanDisk's
offerings GG blue also uses 15 nanometer
planar NAND which is something we
described in our what is NAND animation
and video previously and deploys a
Marvel controller with micron be Ram on
the drive blue drives focus on higher
endurance aiming for better than average
as their targets positioning and push
endurance as a more critical aspect of
the drive than speed the blue warranty
stands at 3 years and might be more
competitively positioned at than the
Green Drive WD blue SSDs are rated
around at ninety seven thousand IOPS
read at 250 gigabytes or seventy nine
thousand IOPS right form factors are
available for 2.5 inch and m2 2286 both
on the SATA 3 interface and the
interface isn't completely saturated
here but it's getting close
finally WD black SOC is sent at the top
of the stack again and are going to be
available in 56 and 512 at capacities
immediately they're not out yet
pre-order right now at time of filming
and a time of filming again those
commuters are at 110 dollars with 256
model and $200 for the 512 gigabyte
model the difference here with WD black
versus blue and green is that doubly
black uses the PCIe interface
says it's transfer medium rather than
theta and that is on PCIe by four lanes
this shifts only in an m2 2280 stick
form factor and it's rated for two
gigabytes per second read tremendous
improvement over the WD blue SSD with
700 to 800 megabytes per second write
random ratings are 170 K IOPS read and
130k IOPS writes for 256 gigabytes with
an increased average power rating of 135
milliwatts over the setting milliwatts
of WD blue w black SSDs includes the
same 5-year warranty as WD black hard
drives leaving some parallelism between
the two and that pretty much wraps up
the differences between the Western
Digital hard drives and solid state
drives
so hopefully the colors make more sense
now the hard drives are once you
understand those everything else is easy
basically again blue is mainstream black
is high-end green is avoid and there
might be some validity to green SSDs but
the price of the same is not great right
now for their performance and then red
and purple are sort of these special
outliers red bean raid 4 will be in
surveillance probably no one in our
audience really needs that for the most
part but it might be a good buy if you
can find them cheap just because they
are a lower volume at least in this
market type of product so article links
