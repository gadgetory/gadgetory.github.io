episode of ask a GM this is our first
post packs episode so I mostly recovered
from being sick at PAX but it did happen
this year after six years of going they
finally got me we're back another
episode there so as always leave your
questions in the comments below if you
have a question for the next episode
Hardware related ideally but if it's
games we'll take that too and we'll
hopefully address in the next episode so
a few things housekeeping to get to
before the questions first of all this
is the rose we'll : in case we saw this
at Computex you may remember it has been
impossible to get and basically vanished
after Computex but it's here now so we
have one of the first models of the case
and we will be reviewing it this week so
do check back for that the case is from
I guess just looking at it from a
perspective of Rose Welles case history
this is one of the most exciting ones
that they've made recently and it does
actually kind of keep at the front end
of some of the industry trends with
tempered glass on the both sides
actually left side I'm not too sure
about but right sides good fronts good
kind of like the Iowa power element this
would be the DIY version of that in some
ways so we'll be looking at that this
week just wanted to bring that up
separately and that's because a lot of
people said they liked it in our
Computex coverage and that it never was
heard from again so it does exist this
is just cuz it's cool we got one of
these at PAX so they give USB keys to
media with a media kit on it that
normally has b-roll gameplay footage
photos screenshots this is the one from
the Warhammer team for Dawn of War 3
which we already posted that like the
channel but it's just a chainsaw sword
basically they're chain sword so just
kind of a neat thing that we're gonna be
putting on the shelf in the background
of some of our DIY video shoots we do so
that stuff aside cool stuff aside the
first question is from exiled storm
definitely seen you around before exiled
storm says hey Steve would you ever
consider testing with lower end CPUs
occasionally to see the effect that they
have on your results in a more
real-world scenario not
x99 system suggesting an i5 or FX chips
and then says I understand it's a lot of
work so yes we have considered it and we
have done it generally let me explain a
few things here so first of all the
reason we use high-end CPUs for GPU
tests is because the basis of test
methodology when you're looking at one
component is to eliminate potential
variables or limiters or throttles or
bowel X whatever word you want to use
with components so one thing variables
you if you're testing GPUs every other
component needs to be the same 100% of
the time doesn't matter if it's low
under high-end just needs to be the same
now the part where it matters if it's
low under high end is when you start
running into issues where the GPU might
be bottlenecked by another component in
the system so when we say this the idea
is that the GPU say you have a 1080 pair
with a g3 2 5 8 obviously the 1080 is
not going to perform that well when
you're looking at the FPS numbers and
that's not because the 1080 can't it's
because the CPU can't keep up
CPU and the GPU both do work for every
frame process so what happens in the
charts and this may be kind of old news
to some of you but what happens is if we
did that scenario everything from a 1080
to maybe I don't even know maybe a 970
g3 to 5/8 pretty weak but we haven't
done that specific test definitely 1080
and a 1070 would look the same and a GP
benchmark if you use a low-end CPU like
that now that's a very extreme example
so the question here why not an i-5 same
thing you just were trying to make sure
that in as many cases as possible black
ops 3 is a really good example where we
sometimes hit in excess of 200 FPS that
wouldn't show up with a lower-end CPU
now there's a valid point here to be
made and it's that the real-world
performance of a complete system is
still important to look at
so the here's here's the decision point
we run into as media there's a time
budget there's a money budget of course
time is the biggest one and with the
benchmarks we'll normally do a GPU
benchmark and then a CPU benchmark with
a high on GPU so they're opposites and
you kind of look at the two and
extrapolate where you need to be as a
buyer the other option and occasionally
we do this is a complete system
benchmark with a very specific set up
normally do that for a size but doing
something like benching every card on an
FX or an i5 I was actually I was just
talking to Luke about this from from -
tech tips so the problem with benching
every card on two platforms for example
maybe a m4 in the future and x99 is
we're literally doubling the amount of
work and it's just not feasible but it
is possible to do something like a
standalone CPU test per game Sandlin GPU
test per game and maybe a one-off system
build quarterly or something like that's
that that may be something that I look
into because obviously the limit is time
it's this is something I would love to
do just to give a better understanding
of where does a certain CPU and a GPU
fall on a chart when paired it would be
good for that even though we can
extrapolate a lot of that from the
standalone GPU and CPU specific
benchmarks still good to look at so
something feasible maybe a quarterly I 5
plus whatever build or an i-5 GPU
benchmark or whatever not something that
would we would be doing for every GPU
benchmark definitely but something that
I will look into because it is requested
frequently it's just a time thing and we
need more exposure to the content to be
worth that investment so you can help
out there by sharing it next question is
Chen kegui who says as high bandwidth
memory being the fast fastest memory
that exists today will we ever see a CPU
with HBM in the future where I have this
in mind but is there a possibility that
we can see HBM RAM in the future or how
fast how does fast memory is HBM affect
PC performance or what benefit can we
see from it so Intel Intel's Knights
landing is using the closest thing to
HBM we've currently seen on a CPU so
that would be MCD Ram that is Intel sort
of bird
of HBM it's not called HBM it's a
different technology it's made by micron
which is Intel owned micron also makes
the gddr5 X as you may be aware used in
the GTX 1080 and the Titan X Pascal
cards so they don't what they're doing
with memory but MCD Rams different from
HP M first of all it operates at 400
gigabytes per second for the bandwidth
whereas HP M 1 &amp;amp; 2 are a bit higher than
that - especially is approaching one
terabyte per second depending on what
you're looking at for how many stacks
you have and things like that because it
is per stack secondly the Intel Knights
landing stuff for MCD Rams looking at
about a 16 gigabyte capacity and it
doesn't exist yet it's been delayed a
good amount of times finally coming out
but it's not a consumer product so
that's not something on consumer side
but it is coming in two CPUs and it's
not just a sort of on paper theory thing
that this will actually exist so that's
important now the question where I think
this gets interesting and we talked
about before actually is HP m in the
future
so this Chen says HP MRAM I think the
more likely thing that will happen is
you'll see CPUs even on consumer
mainstream sides start building HP m to
the chip this makes the chip gigantic or
I should say makes makes the package of
the cpu gigantic as we've seen with
Knights landing because now you're
accommodating maybe four or eight or six
or whatever multiple of two or three
banks for the stacks so it's got to be
larger for the socket in that way and it
works for server boards but not really
consumer but in the future I think what
we'll see happen initially on the very
low-end stuff at least would be a move
away potentially from system ram and a
move toward memory on the cpu package
and that would be interesting because
for low-end consumer stuff obviously all
this scales as we look into the future
eight gigabytes won't really be that
much to us in a few years sixteen
gigabytes after that will not seem that
much that's just how things go but for
consumer oriented tasks you don't need
huge amounts of memory and
hbm's fast it's not cheap but HB m and M
cd-rom are fast they're close to the CPU
package that means I'm theory you could
even shrink the board so this benefits
the really sort of use case specific
deployments of PCs where it might be
used for some sort of pre-built box by
ZOTAC or whatever they make their small
pcs something like that would make sense
so it doesn't exist yet but the theory
of something like that happening I think
is something that actually could be real
not just the crazy talk and the move to
HP M or MCD Ram or whatever on the cpu
package will start to sort of pull the
necessary pull the need away from having
dedicated system RAM which is much
slower it's physically farther from the
chip and that physical distance adds
latency that adds access time to every
every single transaction it's painting
back and forth the memory that takes a
lot of time you're painting storage and
things like that to depend on what's
going on in the system at the time
definitely the future it's just a matter
of can it be done affordably when can it
be done and is it going to be in a
capacity that whenever this rolls out is
something that we as consumers see as
acceptable for our high high capacity
applications you're always going to see
at least for now some form of DDR ddr2
RAM media productions a good example
where we want 32 or 64 gigabytes or
whatever we can get our hands on that's
not gonna happen in HP I'm affordably
anytime soon but the rest of it I think
we'll start seeing this rollout with
Knights landing so if you're interested
in more research knights landing that is
an Intel product that is the first one I
know of CPU side that will have some
form of very high speed memory whatever
they want to call it next question is
from Henry Silva who says amazing
channel thank you I was watching your
Corsair MSI Seahawk X benchmarks as well
as the EVGA hybrid benchmark videos I
noticed the Corsair and MSI model the
GPU craps out for one second after being
endurance tested over the one hour mark
so he's saying we have charts of that
after the one hour mark
the Corsair Seahawk model card basically
the clock rate looked like that and then
I slammed down to about 135 megahertz
and come back up and recover and do it
again repeat and we talked about that
actually a couple cards now not just
that one so he says this does not happen
to the EVGA model do you think this may
be due to the EVGA model cooling the
vram but while the corsair model
overheats that's a good question
this is a boost 3.0 issue to my
understanding I've been talking to
Nvidia about this for a few weeks now
we've decided to start just benchmarking
cards on our own and try and figure out
if there's a pattern
I have duplicates of cards now so we can
start collecting multiple data sets for
one card so here's the here's the issue
at a top level first of all the question
is at the vram cooling I don't know I
don't think so but I don't know secondly
boost 3.0 works a little differently
from boost 2.0 in how the clock rate
responds to different variables so the
variables it looks at our thermal power
and voltage which I guess is part of
power but mostly thermal and power so
when we see the Titan X Pascal card we
liquid-cooled it and the clock rate
increased by 200 megahertz in every
application we tested that happens
because there was a thermal limitation
on the Titan X Pascal by using its stock
cooler so it was operating within spec
so operating that is defined by Nvidia
but the spec could be higher if you put
a better cooler on it
ie a liquid cooler so 200 megahertz gain
that megahertz gain is because of boost
it's because the GPU is no longer
sitting at a fixed clock rate throttles
down very low it should be never below
150 megahertz when idle that's basically
off no 3d clock there but when you cool
it with this better solution suddenly
you get more free more sort of megahertz
out of the clock the other issue is
power so once we got that extra 200
megahertz on the Titan X Pascal then
actually what we were hitting was power
availability or voltage for stability on
the overclock if overclocking so those
two factors are the
contributors to how a clock responds to
boost but as for the drops we're seeing
they are dropping too low
based on the nvidia specs so on video
assign us should never drop to the 135
115 numbers we're seen in some cases
like that Corsair Seahawk card that's
far too low that is visible in game and
it's normally in the point 1 percent
lower than 1% lowest minimally because
it is about 1 second so you're not gonna
see it averaged out over a 2 hour period
of course it just gets smoothed over so
what does that mean well it means that
and videos answer to us was every GPUs
different now even if it's even if we
have 4 gtx 1080s all founders Edition we
benchmark all of them there will still
be an FPS range maybe 1 or 2 FPS on
either side of an average between the
cards and that's because GPU boost 3.0
looks at all these different variables
on the silicon itself silicon's made
differently some of its made better than
others and those small changes now are
dictating and clock rate differences so
that means if we review several models
of the same card it may benchmark
differently marginally but differently
and that's important the next thing is
that Nvidia was telling us that because
of this and because GPU boost dictates
that the card throttles down they don't
want me to use that term throttles
because I guess they define that
differently than than we do but let's
use let let's use the phrase down clocks
the GPU down clocks whenever it can
because it's trying to save power this
is a big deal with Pascal it's a big
deal with Polaris but AMD approaches
that much differently and they can't be
compared with Pascal and videos
approaches every time we can save a watt
we do it so they will down clock and
that is reflected in the charts a little
bit you can see some of our charts are a
little spiky they're not perfectly flat
lines like the RX 480
when we increase the power target but
they are spiky within about 100
megahertz range not a big drop couple
percent sometimes so it's those huge
drops to 135 that really matter and that
were researching the answer to your
question is I don't think it's just the
vram plate
because we've seen this behavior on a
few cards now at 1060 included the titan
acts Pascal didn't drop this hard it
drops but not this hard so I need to
research it more and video was helpful
to a point and there was a limit to the
help I was getting that I could I could
sort of I guess integrate into a heart
content without just testing myself so
we're testing it ourselves now to
validate everything once I have a big
data set I'm gonna go back to Nvidia and
say ok I've done what you suggested now
that we're clear that this isn't a
software issue or whatever can you tell
me more because there's there's only so
much that I can figure out obviously on
my own there's just there's a lot going
on with Boost 2.0 so we will have the
report back and see what we find
based on their further support hopefully
next question FD says hello Steve great
video as always I was wondering whether
or not a window on a case could
significantly impact temperatures and if
their material along with the number of
windows made a difference do fall glass
cases have advantages or disadvantages
so alright should throw this into you
know FD also says I know you don't
review cases often but any insight would
be appreciated we used to review cases a
lot I'm getting back into it just a
there's been non-stop video cards for
six months so we are getting back into
it with this one soon and then
Silverstone soon after that so first of
all different types of glass and
different glasses this is tempered there
normally you're using acrylic so the
tempered glass here is four millimeters
thick that's significantly thicker than
acrylic does the the glass or the window
impact cooling though the answer is not
really so couple factors where it will
impact cooling and where it does is if
we have a setup like this where the
front is completely glass you cannot
take air in through that I know everyone
knows this so there's no air intake here
in this case like in a lot of modern
cases they have moved the intake to this
mesh sort of on the Sun or grill I
should say on the side so as long as
this is thick enough going that way away
from me
as long as it's thick enough that the
fans can still pull air in through the
sides and then pull it into the system
the coin will be fine it's not going to
be it's really it's it will be worse
than if the front is mesh but it will
not be that much worse that you'll
really notice it in most use cases
depending on the case so that's the
first answer to that question
the second answer does the amount of so
if you have more more windows that are
glass is it going to impact the the
temperature only insofar as you will
have fewer places for mesh and fans so
if your option is to have a glass side
panel or a steel one your temperatures
are going to be mostly the same I'm sure
a materials engineer could tell you that
technically one material or the other
would potentially conduct a bit more of
the sort of ambient temperature within
the case but or maybe even seal it in a
bit better but for our purposes as users
I would be very much skeptical if you
saw more than a 1 degree Celsius change
if they had probably talking tenths of a
degree for the most part so the answer
is no unless the alternative is glass
versus a mesh window so on side panels
especially there haven't been a lot of
side intakes lately the 1/2 X this was
very popular that case is basically gone
now but and I think the Antec 900 did it
as well when you have a side intake that
is the best possible GPU cooling setup
that can exist from our testing even all
this front intake it's not better than a
side and take straight into a GPU if
it's positioned correctly the only place
that's not true is with the silverstone
raven our vo2 but the reason they're
good without side intake is because they
have 3 180 millimeter fans on the bottom
that are just blasting air straight into
the video card or straight up into the
system I'd say it is an inverted layout
but straight up into the system that
it's just a lot of air to compete with
380 millimeter predator fans but yeah I
think the answer to that question hidden
short is now there's no real difference
that one contingency aside
stand up or shut up s-- as seems like
there's a lot of work put into this
channel how do you and everyone else
find time the game I don't find a lot of
time the game lately I've been trying to
play more City skylines on the planes
for years I have tried to get into DS
gaming or mobile gaming it's not worked
for me I can't keep my focus on it I
would almost always rather work instead
but lately I've been playing Age of
Empires 2 on the D s and that's kept my
attention so I'm playing a bit of that
on planes which there seems to be four
of those at least a week for plane trips
or her week a month although a week
lately I guess it's kind of accurate
with packs and all that stuff but yeah
it's a city skylines Age of Empires and
maybe one day I will get into overwatch
but other than that that's about it so
thank you for watching as always patron
like the post roll video if you want to
fund our efforts to buy more time and
use it to play games otherwise subscribe
for more content comments below for
questions next week I'll see you all
next time
