ckase we gave it pretty high marks
overall we gave it an award we noted
that we liked the build quality the ease
of installation features the cable
management but our one complaint was
that it was quote warm and I mean it's a
closed-off front case it's gonna be
warmer than its competition with a mesh
front lo and behold the fractal has now
responded to that criticism with a mesh
front version of the define C so for all
of those who said or who took issue with
our use of the word warm to define
something which was objectively warmer
than its competition looks like fractal
at least somewhat agreed so this is the
define the define C's counterpart the
mesh of Phi C and we're gonna review it
today it's the same case as a define C
aside from a few smaller features and
then the one major feature the mesh
front so we don't need to go through the
entire thing and mostly just thermals
and noise before that this coverage is
brought to you by our patreon backers
without whom we may not have even
ventured into this case review by
supporting us on patreon comm slash
gamers Nexus you can help out with
contributing to the upcoming reviews and
voice your opinion in discord to let us
know what you'd like to see us test
learn more at the link below the
functional aspects of this case and the
build process are exactly the same as
described in our review of the window
defined C which we gave a quality build
award it's compact
well made and carefully designed if you
want to know more about those aspects of
the case check our review of the defined
C or accompanying video for more detail
the only real difference here is the
front panel which is black metal mesh
backed by a thin foam filter and a
plastic frame the foam will hopefully
act as a very fine filter preventing the
open design of the case from blasting
all the components with dust for some
reason the front IO is also a bit
different
rather than being attached to the
chassis as it is in the define C it's
now built into the front panel which is
an inconvenience we experienced in our
Antec p8 review the removable plastic
top panel included with the define seat
is now missing from the Mesha Phi but a
magnetic filter is still included
again there's none of the noise damping
that padding found in the defined models
as the target audience for this case
cares more about cooling than anything
else and that's how it comes down to
this is basically for people who like to
define look but want air to get into
their case and so we have the measure
Phi we're gonna run through the thermals
in noise today that's really the only
focus of this review if you would like
more information again on ease of
installation build features things like
that check our define see review it's
the same case aside from the features
already noted just like with the be
quiet dark bass pro 900 we're starting
with standalone test first and then
we'll look at comparative numbers our
standalone testing will focus on the
define C and the Mesha Phi C and the
stock configuration our torture test
pushed the CPU 54.3 Celsius above
ambient on the Massif I see there's an
unobstructed path of airflow from the
front intake fan through the heatsink
and out the rear exhaust but there's
definitely room for improvement
replacing the intake with to 140
millimeter fans for instance decrease to
the Delta a full seven degrees to forty
seven point three Celsius since the
stock fans and configuration of the
define C and mesh Phi C are identical
the only advantage of the match by C is
that it's got more air available in the
intake area not only does this make its
baseline temperature three degrees lower
than it defines fifty four point three
versus 57 point three but it also means
that the Mesha Phi benefits more from
the extra fans 140 millimeter knocked
was only lower that defines at Delta
four point one degrees compared to the
seven for the Massif IC widening the gap
even further as a sanity check we
removed the front panel of defined C to
make a pseudo mesh of Phi and this
resulted in a CPU temperature Delta of
46 C over ambient this is one point
three degrees lower than even the Mesha
Phi because there is no layer of mesh to
get in the way of the airflow fractal
has done a pretty good job of designing
a front panel that cools nearly as well
as not having a front panel at all it's
pretty difficult to do and they've done
it
comparatively we can look at other cases
we've tested for the same torture
workload seen a fifty four point three
Celsius as a decent delta temperature
competitive with the SD 40 elites and
270 are but outperformed by
Silverstone's mesh
fronting our l06 at 47.8 celsius this
case has remained one of the best value
cases for a cooling and performance
oriented mid tower PC and that remains
true here with the added fans however
the mattify has the lowest CP delta
we've yet seen but again you've probably
achieve similar on many of these cases
but I also put into naktu a 140
millimeter fans in them the point is
just that the mesh fi has plenty of
headroom for improvement and that's what
you want in a case of the mesh front the
GPU tortured temperature Delta was fifty
seven point eight degrees and the Noctua
fans only lowered this by one point six
Celsius the center of the stock intake
fan is level with the backplate of our
GPUs so most the air is pushed over it
and sucked out of the exhaust even a
dead zone between the card and the
shroud this is part of the price of such
a compact case our 140 millimeter fans
or we're as high as possible in the top
two slots but users should experiment
with different fan placements for
instance consider putting a lower fan
flush with the PSU shroud to cool the
GPU you'll lose some air into the shroud
but overall the GPU does need some air
as we found out with these top oriented
fan configuration there's also a section
of the power supply shroud that can pop
out to fit a third front fan of these
smaller sizes particularly an either way
this is still a big improvement the
defined stock GPU temperature Delta is
about one point seven degrees higher but
worse than that it didn't benefit at all
from additional fans one of the master
PI's biggest strengths in comparison is
its ability to scale temperature as fans
are added completely removing the front
panel resulted in a fifty four point
five degree Delta and that's cooler but
still encouragingly close to the mesh if
I compared to other cases on the chart
the Mesha Phi is a GPU Delta is near the
bottom and even additional fans don't
really give it an edge here not unless
you were to relocate the center fan down
to the bottom and that's what we would
suggest doing we tested with a top t
configuration and clearly a more optimal
setup for this type of build would be
one a fan at the top to direct air into
the CPU cooler and one fan lower down to
direct air into the GPU cooler the RL
zero six is Delta is more than 10,000 so
lower with its stock fans with no
Changez and playing around with phantom
placement using a radiator cooled GPU or
maybe just differently sized graphics
cards would help out here
but these temperatures aren't dangerous
they're just again relatively warm 3d
marks a fire strike extreme tests with
stock fans put the GPU close to its
temperature limit at 60.3 Celsius above
ambient and the define at C was the same
with invariance that's just under the
Antec PA to which we sort of knocked
recently for its cooling more
directional airflow would once again
help out and you can solve that because
we've now shown clearly that doing to
top fans is not the optimal
configuration for this type of build
blender offers a realistic test for CPU
and GPU workloads Delta's remained well
within the limits for the CPU rendering
workload we were at 40.2 celsius at
delta T over ambient with the mesh of IC
and for the GPU rendering workload we
were at 30.3 celsius for again GP
rendering without the extreme stress of
a torture test the stock define C and
mesh if I see you had C be Delta's that
were roughly equal let's move on to
noise we originally reviewed the plastic
windowed version of the define C which
may be louder than the original case but
still has enough insulation to keep
things pleasantly quiet the Metro fire
has none and its stock configuration
there's only one fan behind the front
panel but it's directly exposed to
anyone sitting in front of it as our all
fans added to the front or the top this
is not ask you to buy for silence that
define C is 38.6 DBA is technically
noisier than any of the other cases on
our charge other than the Corsair 570 X
and a Silverstone are l06 both of which
have three front fans but it's audibly
on the same level as the SD 40 elites
one top and one rear fan and the defined
C with the old front measured at 35 to
36 DBA just for a point of comparison we
liked fractals defined C when we last
reviewed it and we still like it now the
difference is
fractal has resolved our one complaint
which is that the defines he was warm
and for the type of site we are type of
outlet we are warm is one of the main
things we don't like in enclosures we do
a lot of cooling tasks we are
performance oriented and so this is a
good turn for fractal it introduces them
or reintroduces them into a market way
oddly a lot of the competition has
vanished over the past year or so as the
trend in the case market has gone more
towards an attempt at sleekness and
attempt at following trends and things
like tempered glass which of course this
still does but it's got a mesh front so
it's nice to see some case companies
paying attention to the fact that
cooling matters and you can actually
lose clocks and lose FPS with poor
cooling and ventilation to GPUs and
things like that the real takeaway here
thermally is that the mesh fic isn't
inherently that much better than the
define Z at least not with our
configuration the way to really take
advantage of this case and the
conversion that fractal is done is to
add fans to the front with the stock
configuration in blender GPU tests we've
seen about a 2 Celsius difference
blender CPU tests they're effectively
the same temperature 3d mark the CPU is
better by 2 Celsius with the Mesha Phi
the GPU is the same torch or GPU test
we're two degrees Celsius better in the
mesh by torture CPU test for 3 degrees
Celsius better than the mattify but none
of those numbers are that big of a
change for how big of a change the case
has gone through so to get the most out
of this you have to add fans as you can
see in our two fan comparisons from the
earlier benchmark tables it's clear that
the mesh to fight taps into the
potential of those more than the defined
C does which makes sense given the front
configuration so for this case what we
learned here of course we only have so
much time to test so many configurations
so the takeaway is if you buy this and
if you add a fan to the front we would
recommend going with one lower down so
that you can direct it at the GPU it'll
really drop temperatures and our testing
we did one fan up here one here and
obviously that ended up sort of skimming
the backplate of the video card didn't
help it a whole lot so that would be the
takeaway there you can learn from that
configuration for competition
Silverstone's redline 0 6 Pro is now
directly competing with this it's got
three front fans it is one of the best
cool the cases we've worked with lately
it's a mid tower as well it comes in
white and black and
I think there might be one other color
and 75 bucks so it's not too distant
from this price there's a tempered glass
version for a hundred dollars so if
tempered glass matters to you keep that
in mind as a whole though we hope that
fractal continues to mattify if I their
cases going forward a mattify ass would
be pretty cool and welcomed I think by
most of the community so fractal well
done thank you for venturing into the
ventilation focused or cooling focused
case market while still retaining some
of their core design elements it's nice
to see a company that can try to resolve
some of the criticism of a case while
also not detracting from what they're
known for and in this case if the only
element that gets anywhere distant from
sleek and flat is this sort of
tessellated mesh you've done pretty well
so yeah we like this case overall and if
you're interested in this case where
others you can check the links of the
description below patrick wrote the
review did the testing and yeah
subscribe for more you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and razaaq's
establish out directly we bought this
case because it was highly requested by
folks in our patreon backer group on
twitter and everywhere so having that
support helps us to buy things like this
when you all want to review and we can't
get a sample so that's all for this time
I'll see you all next time
