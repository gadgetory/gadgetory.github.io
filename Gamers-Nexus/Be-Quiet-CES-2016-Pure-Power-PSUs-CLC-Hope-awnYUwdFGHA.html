gaming PC be quiet didn't have any major
updates this year at CES but they did
have a few small increments in their
power supplies and a little bit with
their cooling fans from the power supply
line up they have a series called the
pure power series and the pure power
series is getting a few changes made one
of the things in the US market that was
different than the German market is that
us fans be quiet asked for all black
cables instead of the standardized color
schemes so be quiet is going to make
that change you'll see that in a little
bit another change in that same series
the pure power series is they're gonna
do an 80 plus upgrade right now the pure
power series is 80 plus bronze they're
going to go to 80 plus silver on that
one the other small changes they're just
going to change the naming schemes the
pure power series is going to go from
pure power l8 to just pure power 9 from
there you can take a look also at the
previously released dark power pro 11

called the silent links 3 the salad
links 3 was supposed to be available for
cases air coolers and from just retail
sale and it was going to be available in
80 90 to 120 m 1 40 millimeter but we
