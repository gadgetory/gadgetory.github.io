Nexus tonight and today we were looking
at a game called
SCARA the blade remains please avert
your eyes from the image to the left of
the menu it is uh this game is currently
on a Kickstarter there are no other
players online and we're gonna have to
play with BOTS this is effectively think
of this as a sort of like quake or
unreal except with melee combat in its
current form and more of a fantasy
environment so more similar to the likes
of fury and scope and there are a couple
other games out there that were like
this but they're not very popular and I
really wish they would be more popular
so we have only two maps we can choose
from this is only in Kickstarter right
now it is not really ready for the
public yet and we've got free-for-all
and team deathmatch
let's do FFA first so we can choose our
character we only have two options I'm
gonna go ahead and set every other one
there to der no all right so we are
loaded in the game this is it it is
running on Unreal Engine 4 which is why
some of the lighting effects and the the
I guess I suppose that might be bloom
but I'm not sure it looks kind of pretty
it looks a little nice not too bad for
you efore and ue4 of course now
available for $20 a month which means
you're gonna be seen a lot more games
like this but that that doesn't
necessarily mean a good thing because it
actually makes the game market more
saturated so let's look at the gameplay
you can see here things are pretty slow
paced in terms of movement I've got a
shield I can hold it up with control and
we can swing with click now here's
here's where you're gonna hear me
starting to tear this game apart the
game has a very interesting combat and
that I excuse me an a very interesting
idea and that I want it to be quake or
unreal accepts melee and fantasy but
it's so slow in terms of movement and
that's about that's about as fancy as it
gets right there so our swings
that's a swainton two three four that's
a swing so pretty long space in between
them you really only have those two
attacks I just showed there that is
right-click and left-click and then they
can interrupt by hitting you with one of
those one thing I have discovered is
that once you hit an enemy one time if
you keep hitting them while they're I
just I just died that was a little bit a
little bit strange but if you keep
hitting them after that first hit lands
they're never gonna be able to retaliate
because of the way the cooldown works
with the place that we start I was
laughing because uh my camera went into
the wall there so yeah this this is this
Escarra it's uh it's definitely
incomplete
truth be told the mechanics need a huge
amount of work because we've got two
types of attacks movement is very slow
as you can see here I can just keep
swinging he's never going to be able to
retaliate can you imagine how
infuriating that would be as a player
and a server it's it's just not uh it's
not very balanced it's what it comes
down to here cuz he's never gonna be
able to move as long as I keep hitting
him and then we get the killing blow
which is very violent never uh never a
bad thing in video games I suppose but
that's I that's really it you've seen
the game now deathmatch or team
deathmatch rather also exists as you
would expect at whoa whoa whoa what is
that
oh that guy is breakdancing
so it's team deathmatch same thing
except with teams of four so
it is built for multiplayer it is a
built with servers in mind you can host
a server but right now of course no one
has the game except for a handful of
media and maybe some Kickstarter backers
I'm not sure on that the game currently
has I believe $25,000 toward it on a
kickstart like at that but look at that
rag doll 25 grand I think they want
another 10 I think they want 35 at total
and it's got a couple it's got about 10
more days maybe 11 more days of the
campaign so here's what I think I quite
honestly I think the developers should
have waited a bit longer before
unveiling this demo to the public
because as you can see I've already
grown tired of it oh that's that's
Pleasant
that is excellent right there sir such
BM trying to try to give an overview
he's using my strategy against me by the
way
so it was released little too early
because it's it's a really the concept
is cool it's just it's not there and I
don't know that it will be there this
this demo doesn't really instill
confidence and that's why I think it's
ok to wait through these a demo because
of I saw something with a bit more
mechanical intuition I would I would
perhaps feel a bit better about this but
just the way it feels feels everything
in a game of this type it does not feel
great actually I think getting away from
this really slow brawler combat and
moving toward something more twitchy
would be better suited for this type of
game and I actually would really like to
see that fury did that and unfortunately
fury
I suppose the match is over
unfortunately fury died very early
because I had tremendous amounts of
defects in the game so there's a gap in
the market and it should be filled let's
let's just get a really quick look at
Team Deathmatch and then we're gonna
close up this review okay so team
deathmatch on the other map this one is
a bit prettier
Unreal Engine 4 is capable of doing
phenomenal things with very little
effort to get started of course it takes
a good deal of effort to get something
really truly optimized and and pretty
but this is an indie title on ue4 it
looks pretty damn good it's just all in
the gameplay at this point so we were
gonna try it and right click there we go
got a good right-click in there and now
he will never be able to hit me again
and he's dead so this is team deathmatch
is for before I believe I don't think
these do anything I tried earlier they
glow from the outside maybe pickups in
the future maybe it's just a box I think
I think red is bad so we're gonna hit
red it's very violent and and I mean
really that's that's it that's all there
is to it so this is SCARA if you would
like to read more about this game hit
the link in the description below I'm
just exploring right now excuse me
hit the link in the description below
you can read a little bit more see some
screenshots you've seen everything there
is to see if you're interested in it you
can back in on Kickstarter I am
personally going to say that I just
don't I don't see it right now it needs
more and and should have been withheld a
bit longer by the developers so that's
what I think you can disagree with me
and give them the extra $10,000 if they
need if you so please I will not stop
