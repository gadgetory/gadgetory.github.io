GN as always leave your questions in the
comment section below if you have them
there were a lot of good questions last
time we're not gonna be able to get to
all of them but hopefully get through a
good amount of these and the very least
before diving into the sgm content it is
again brought to you by and the free
synced devices including this lg monitor
which is a 34 inch display 34 40 by 1440
and has the usual assortment of letters
and numbers that is difficult to
remember but I think I got it I think
it's 34 um 88 - P nailed it doesn't even
have the check haha that is a that's an
$800 display 34 40 by 1440 with free
sync will have a link in the description
if you're curious to learn more about it
so let's get to the first question first
one is brought to you by foreigns gaming
tech who says Steve a new question
concerning a high performance cards on
low resolutions where you see a
performance ceiling we saw this in your
Titan XP review and you talked about
this in tgw which is tech gaming weekly
that is hosted by Joker productions I
was on there a couple days ago
I'll be on there again on Wednesday this
week so he's foreign Gaming taxes could
you explain why a Titan XP and a gtx
1080 have the same performance at 1080p
IE why even a 69 50 X maybe bottlenecked
in this situation so we were not using a
69 50 X I don't know how that would
perform exactly the reason that 59 30 K
it's a bit lower around than a 69 50 X
but ignoring that in our specific test
case where we had a 59 30 K I don't know
what game I was talking about at the
time but may have been GTA 5 at 1080p
probably with a Titan X and a GTX 1080 I
think with GTA 5 we hit somewhere around
the same 134 FPS range or something like
that so that could be a few things one
depending on well the obvious point is
that there's obviously a bottleneck
elsewhere in the system this is almost
always the CPU some games very specific
ones like I think f1 2012
does actually have some memory
bottlenecks to some points which is
pretty interesting but not
and normally CPU bottleneck and the
reason that happens is either you've
enabled a CPU intensive setting in the
graphics maybe the game does its physics
processing on the CPU or something like
that or some other thread management job
allocation function and the engine is
not really particularly friendly with
the CPU you might be stacking one thread
or one core a lot more heavily than
anything else in the system and that
could cause a choke point things like
that which are just optimization items
on the game side normally that can cause
it but most commonly it's something
where because the CPU has to do work for
every frame created there's going to be
a limit at which the CPU can effectively
no longer keep up with the GPU so you
could put a Titan X in there you could
put maybe three Titan X's in there if if
I had them I do this to demonstrate it
but if you have like say let's keep it
single cards for easier demonstration
you have a Titan X versus a GT X 1080 we
showed that maybe even have other ten
80s at varying frequencies in there they
might all perform within a couple frames
of each other which shouldn't really
happen at least with the Titan XP and
that is I mean obviously demonstrated
when you increase the resolution to 1440
or 4k it starts becoming more GPU bound
and so now you can see the differences
between the GP is more easily this is
also why we try to use as high and CPU
as possible for VP benchmarking but
you're still going to run into limits
and when the CP is trying to keep up
with the GPU and creating these frames
one of the things that it most commonly
does fall behind it is the draw calls so
every time for DirectX 11 OpenGL old
your API is basically that are higher
level and have these abstraction layers
between the components and the software
you have these abstraction layers in
between every time primitives need to be
created or Poly's or whatever the GPU is
effectively it's communicating with a
CPU for every one of those draws that's
called a draw call and that's a problem
that's why low-level API czar promising
we still need to see better
implementation but you get the idea
where level API is can bypass some of
that so that's normally where the
bottleneck
but there are other reasons as well like
physics or something like that if it's
cpu-bound next question is from Ryan
Razer who says would you consider
putting the gtx 1070 micron vram issue
out there none of youtubers say anything
about it whereas forums are filled with
posts every review on YouTube has
Samsung version of memory could you do a
comparison of the 10 serie Samsung
versus micron so I don't have both of
those that's that's why we haven't done
a comparison it's as simple as that
as far as talking about it I suppose the
the issue that's in reference here is
basically a supply-side change so some
gtx 1070 is shipping now have micron
memory whereas the ones that shipped out
initially had Samsung memory and this
happens pretty regularly it's not new to
the 10 70s and the reason it happens is
just the suppliers and manufacturers
trying to keep up with demand
so in this specific instance Samsung
doesn't output the same quantity of
memory modules that is required to
produce the GPUs in demand by the buyers
and so Nvidia or whomever EVGA a big
partners have to source their memory
from multiple vendors in this case
they're introducing micron to the mix so
they have two sources of memory they can
try and keep up with a stutter step of
the supply basically it's pretty as more
card so that's the idea now as for the
performance difference I don't know the
technical reasons why this is happening
at a low level but basically as I
understand it and I don't have one of
these cards as I understand it the
micron memory doesn't overclock quite as
high as the Samsung memory and that's
kind of the crux of the issue
Ryan razor here is saying that some
people report stuttering checkerboarding
BSO DS I think that's mostly happening
with overclocking but I really can't
validate it personally so let's just go
on that for now there is a BIOS update
out there if you apply it from what I've
been told by partners and by some of our
users
the BIOS update should resolve the issue
where you can get those overclocks
without the same stuttering or BSOD or
checkerboarding issues basically
artifacting that's being seen on the non
bios updated cards so that's as much as
I know that's really that's the start in
the end of my knowledge of this right
now until I have a device in hand I will
not comment any further on it there's no
point because I can't test it so if we
get a 1070 device with micron memory
maybe we can test it do a BIOS update
see if this is actually an issue or if
it's resolved with that BIOS update but
that's the idea that's what's going on
if anyone's curious as far as I
understand it though it's not a huge
issue if you are not doing memory
overclocking but if you've had issues
with it please feel free to leave a
comment let me know because I'd be good
for me to know about next comment is
from Alex gray who says hi Steve you
mentioned in previous videos that 18
inch MSI laptops are the same design as
fan books is MSI buying fan books and up
in the specs are the fan books tab stack
them aside machines or are they just
using identical third-party chassis
what's the relationship between MSI and
fan book fan book is a brand but or a
model I should say by CyberPower
CyberPower is a system integrator or an
SI they compete with origin high power
folks like that so they're the si si is
often source their notebooks from
somewhere else they don't generally
actually make them so origin and cyber
power and IRI power just as three kind
of larger companies all use MSI for one
of their suppliers for laptops so MSI
makes the actual unit generally they do
actually have supply the masalas 2
though by MSI is effectively the the OEM
and is rebranded by CyberPower origin
whomever the reason you might buy one or
the other is because as I think is
pointed out here is sometimes there's
different specs that are only available
through one partner and maybe not
through the source and the other reason
is add-ons so in the case of some of the
SIS
like cyber power and Iowa power and I
think also origin blast I tested they
don't really do all the bloatware that
you'll get straight from MSI so there
are some value-add
to be had but that's the relationship
basically MSI makes the units and
CyberPower the other is buy it and sell
it as their on model laptop Cleavon Sega
are also really popular supplier or om
is for notebooks next question brand new
tracks do you get bored of reviewing
products I mean like does it get stale
until you get the next latest and
greatest not really to be honest because
it's such a crunch to get all of the
production done and testing every time
we are I'm normally writing scripts for
videos and right up until we film it and
then I'm writing the review for it as
it's being edited so it's pretty fast
paced I don't really get bored of them I
would probably say I wouldn't want to
review 410 50s for example that would
maybe get a bit boring or at least
uninteresting if not boring
but there's almost always something you
can find whether it's a really cool
design or a really bad design or
something like that so there's always
something to look out for and that's the
fun part the part that would not be fun
is if you are running into a lot of
issues with a product that are not
easily explained or again with a low end
like a ten fifty hundred dollar card the
manufacturers you know they're cutting
corners they have to it's a hundred
dollar card so they're not gonna have
that interesting cooling solutions but
they can still have interesting flaws
and that's always fun to look for so no
I don't really get too bored of
reviewing things I would say more
overloaded worth reviewing things is
more of the problem than bored next
question I would Kurt says hi Steve a
while ago the pump of my 980 I broke
down after fiddling with it seemed to
start working again about it roughly 50%
speed I wanted to the RMA the card temp
seemed fine pumps less audible basically
what should I do
so I don't know how you're reading your
pump rpm because the hybrid cooler the
pump is connected straight to the video
card and there's as far as I'm aware no
way to read the pump rpm maybe if you
plugged it into the motherboard but you
need something to adapt the connector
because it's not the same fan connector
as you'd find from a fan to a board so
that
I'm not sure where you're seen your
speed maybe if you're going based on
noise but I think what's more likely the
case is I don't know maybe some air
pocket got sucked through the the
radiate of the pump and you had noise
reduction after that one through if you
have your radiator with the tubes
mounted at the top flip it around that
would help but if you think there's
actually an issue I would definitely
warranty it before it runs out because
you don't want it to fail again later if
you don't think there's an issue which
it doesn't sound like there's
necessarily an issue but yeah check the
the radiator orientation I guess is
probably what I would do first famous
killer 5 says do you know or do you test
your how do you test your GPU overclocks
is vally enough I've read everywhere on
the internet and you've set it to that
synthetic benchmarks are not real-world
scenarios meaning that some overclocks
will pass some benchmark can be unstable
in games how do you test yours so we
test ours by I've shown this in the how
to overclock your rx 480 video I
normally launched the stress test for
3dmark and let it run while I tweak the
clock settings and frequency voltage all
that stuff and see if it fails during
that process and it will eventually fail
and then from that point dial it back to
where it's stable in 3dmark and then
start testing in games so I'll do a
couple test passes in like shadow of
Mordor The Witcher things like that
where you get varying boost and load
levels on the cards and then at that
point after just a couple passes of
those normally you've got a pretty good
idea of if it's stable or not now
ideally if you're a user applying the
clock for effectively permanent use you
might want to do an in-game benchmark
like dirt rally or something and let it
run overnight but that's the basics of
it yeah I would not use just a synthetic
test basically because it'll look a lot
higher than what it's actually capable
of often times and especially that's
true with fur mark next question Josh
Orenburg says is a big question you guys
always say there's no such thing as a
good or bad company like a good or bad
product so to clarify that the reason I
tell people tell writers the
that phrase is because I don't want
people writing in articles things like
we trust company a company a is a good
company because they everyone can screw
up in the industry so products I go buy
this product is good this product is bad
not the company that makes it so that
that stated that clarified the question
is is there a koala variance in quality
lifespan of a product like motherboard
video card memory for different
manufacturers or they all pretty much on
level playing field can you trust all
Strix cards for example or EVGA cards
from any lineup any company to have
similar build quality or lifespan among
their line of of components so is it
even possible to make accurate estimate
of probable lifespan for each product
type it's sort of not really um not for
us that's that's more of a validation
lab thing to do like something they
would hopefully do internally where um
TBF numbers not from media outlet though
we don't have enough sample size but uh
the question well except for things like
pumps where you know the liquid will
permeate the tubes within five years or
something like that but the question
there is variants and products they use
different suppliers for their components
you might have one video card just
taking this if you have like Strix card
versus a higher-end hall-of-fame or
classified card or something like that
just the supplier of the vrm alone will
be different and impact how things play
out and there's plenty of examples of
where that's a good or a bad thing
depending on what brand or what product
you looking at motherboards there so
much has moved to the CPU these days
that they are less important than they
used to be a lot of stuffs integrated a
lot of controllers are integrated you
don't need to solder them onto the board
anymore but they're still variants it's
still possible to buy a board that's
more likely to fail then or more likely
to overclock better than another board
and that's generally dictated by things
like the power design the components use
pastors used I look just again on
motherboards you might have killer
networking versus Intel something that
makes your life miserable
versus Intel's networking solution I've
had bad experiences with killer so yeah
there are differences but there is
definitely a point where something like
memory which is more of a commodity at
this point is is not quite as varied in
what you're buying especially for gaming
where it's not going to be as much of an
impact or any way to your performance so
that's the short of the the answer last
question I'm amazed this channel isn't
bigger after seeing subscriber count
just join the ranks by the way what do
you think about the NX so first of all
stand up or shut up
which is the name of the user by the way
and not me same head to them the user's
name just and appreciate up uh it is
called an antenna switch okay it's not
an axe anymore everyone knows that get
with the program
so my thoughts I think the Nintendo NX
is pretty interesting will from a
hardware perspective alone its Tegra I
said it'll be Pascal will see I'm fairly
positive that's right but it's been in
development for a while some folks are
suggesting Maxwell and videos text on
their blog did say that the switch will
be using something I don't know the
exact quotes but paraphrase is something
like the best or the latest architecture
used in the world's most powerful gaming
GPUs which is what NVIDIA says to me in
Pascal so that was my assumption either
way it'll have a Tegra SOC Pascal or
Maxwell I'm leaning towards Pascal the
the portability will be interesting from
a battery life testing standpoint I
think it's a very risky move and I think
that's what Nintendo needs right now
because they're getting a lot of
pressure from PlayStation and Xbox in
the traditional market and they hold the
handheld market there's really not much
out there for competition so merging the
two means they can merge their
development and hopefully have better
output for the two types of player bases
on one device with one set of coding so
it's interesting we'll see how it
actually works what the battery life is
stuff like that but I've got more
thoughts in the original NX / switch
announcement specs video we did so check
