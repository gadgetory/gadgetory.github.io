with more ups and downs than roller
coaster tycoon world's production and
release schedule or at least you
couldn't use roller coaster tycoon world
to build it because the game has been
delayed so far into oblivion that now
all we have is quote early 2016 for the
launch date nonetheless three developers
deep Atari continues to push the project
forward the result of Ataris most recent
delays is today's announcement which is
really more of a re reveal or RIA
nouncement that roller coaster tycoon
world will take advantage of the Steam
Workshop something we discussed on
camera with Atari at PAX Prime last year
users will be able to use unity
compatible 3d editing programs to make
their own content and features for our
ctw and some examples from Atari include
quote a new type of tree very exciting a
tiki idol a rocket ship or a whole
volcano which rules out any Polynesian
space program theme parks or the launch
product but hopefully someone will
eventually make all that now key item
here back when we talked to atari
previously new rides in their entirety
we're not actually in the plans for
multiple content so in games like cities
skylines and other games skyrim what
have you where the modders are able to
completely add new gameplay elements
with mechanics or whatever is connected
with the new rollercoaster tycoon game
that is not immediately in the plans for
our ctw it's more the modding of
aesthetics varieties and it's all just
new sort of prefab objects and elements
not necessarily full rides which is of
course the thing that everyone is
actually interested in beyond just
making objects however players who take
advantage of the system will be able to
post them the Steam Workshop and this
would allow anyone to download them and
place them into their own theme parks
ugc will also be compatible with the
games piece-by-piece custom content
system quite a mouthful and that allows
players to combine multiple features
into one larger feature like a volcano
rocket I suppose not really sure what
they have in mind there however Atari
has also stated that this feature won't
be available on launch this isn't the
first time we've seen user-generated
content
some games like city skylines and dota 2
have certainly made it work a steam
workshop and cities skylines very
closely resembles what our ctw is trying
to do but has done it first obviously
and we've made plenty of comparisons to
this in the past with other videos but
city skylines approach allows fairly
plug and play object and modded asset
placement within the game and that makes
life easier for players who want to
change up gameplay without committing to
complete overhauls and sort of getting
locked into a particular save file
Ataris blog post did not provide
commentary on whether the content will
be monetizable by the modders but given
the fiasco with steam workshops skyrim
attempt that seemed a poor choice for
any game at this time in the same blog
post it was suggested that the launch
date would be announced soon again and
that is unless they have to bring in
another developer or delay and host
another willfully criticism riddled beta
or just cancel another beta altogether
the bold the brave and the very
interested can pre-order the game
through the official website but with
multiple changed launch dates and the
utter absence of one of the plan to beta
periods who knows what you'll end up
with or when you'll get it third launch
dates the charm I suppose subscribe for
follow-up coverage of roller coaster
tycoon world and hit that patreon link
