motherboard at CES equipped with what
one could assume is an AMD x4 70 chipset
given information from AMD on its own
launch timelines it would also be
reasonable to assume that the new
motherboards can be expected for roughly
April of this year alongside Andes rise
in CPU refresh this is all information
learned from Andes public data as 4
gigabytes gaming 7 motherboard the new
one with an AM for socket the first
thing we noticed is that it has real
heat sinks on the VRMs and that it's
actually running what appears to be a
higher-end configuration for what we
would assume is the new rise and launch
what we've been calling risin + or some
have called risin 2 before that this
coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the flow liquid cooler
the flow is a 360 millimeter radiator
with three ring RGB LED fans you can
program the fans our custom lighting
through software and then of course
benefit from the larger radiator size
and cooling performance learn more at
the link in the description below
started with the heatsink gigabyte has
taken pride and listening to media and
community concerns about vrm heat sinks
over the last year and has now added an
actual thin stack atop its 10 phase V
core vrm to give an idea we saw a
significant performance improvement on
the EVGA X 299 dark motherboard with
just the finned heat sinks not even
using the built-in fans so it's
definitely worthwhile
we saw upwards of 20 degree improvements
over the fat blocks in some cases with
EVGA s board since there's blocks don't
provide any actual service area the vrm
on the new gigabyte board is a doubled 5
phase using international rectifier 3 5
9 9 v core drivers with 3 5 5 3 MOSFETs
and ir35 to 0 one is used for the PWM
and the board is comprised of a 6 layer
PCB a doubling scheme is used to create
an effective 10 phase and an additional
2 phases are allocated to memory on the
gaming 7 Wi-Fi board these MOSFETs are
cooled with direct touch copper heat
pipes or one of them anyway at 6
millimeters in diameter which contacts
be a thin thermal pad for maximum heat
transfer potential the aluminum fin
stack takes up the rest of the heat
spreading process and
still managed to get some visual
elements in there as well other keyboard
features include an external clock Gen
which is really useful for dialing and
over clocks to smaller intervals than
whole 1x jumps additional overclocking
features include a dual BIOS useful
recovery and targeted support for up to
4,000 megahertz memory from what we've
found out anyway about Andy's new CPUs
it's unclear how well the target will
work out for 4000 megahertz but that's
what we're expecting as of now the board
has two BIOS dip switches present for
dual BIOS or single or dual BIOS mode
and for PCIe slots the board has three
PCIe x16 length slots which are wired
for x16 x8 for the first two and then by
four for the third one based on the
backside of the motherboard a couple of
PCIe x16 all over the board perimeter
which is welcomed and an integrated i/o
shield the rear i/o panel includes a
CMOS clear switch and a power button
both of which are also welcomed along
with some digital RGB LEDs that I guess
will take at this point and finally it
is named the gaming Sun Wi-Fi because
it's got a 2 by 2 Wi-Fi module on there
as for release timelines and price given
the presence of the am for socket and
Andes event at CES for the rise and
refresh we can assume this is x4 70
release is targeted at roughly April
based on Angie's own schedule and we
think the board will be in the $250
range plus or minus a couple bucks
briefly gigabyte also has a new mining
motherboard we won't go too in depth on
this one but it's a b250 chipset for
Intel LGA socket CPUs LGA 1151
as for PCIe slots the mining board has
12 of them one of which is a full by 16
length which is also electrically wired
four by sixteen and it's using two molex
headers on the board for additional
power to the PCIe lanes the motherboard
also will include a 3-way splitter for
power supplies so you can piggyback
multiple power supplies for the single
board and that's about all we know about
this one for now so as always you can
