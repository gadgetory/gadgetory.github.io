to DTI notebook GPU which is ultimately
a desktop GPU in a notebook with some
changes to things like clock speed this
has been the trend for a while now with
the end of the M series or at least see
me in the end of it today we're using a
GE 72 7r e apache pro notebook from msi
which has a four gigabyte version of the
1050 TI though there are also two
gigabyte versions and that's got an i7
7700 HQ cpu adds 2.8 gigahertz with no
changes otherwise the GE at 72
seven-hour a Apache pro is coming up in
a separate review for us soon
but today we're just looking at a 10 2 d
TI GPU performance rather than reviewing
the notebook as a whole before getting
to those that this coverage is brought
to you by EVGA and their 1080p is c2
which we've recommended fairly highly
for its build quality and the icx
sensors which are kind of fun to play
with you can check our full SC 2 review
for the 1080i if you're curious to learn
more or you can click the link in the
description below to find the product
page for the 1080i st to look at the gtx
1050 TI GPU alone rather than reviewing
the entire notebook helps us because we
can establish baseline forward weight
where you should expect the tendon TTI
to perform for all the notebooks now
because notebooks have differences in
CPU and other spec it's not like we can
just swap the one part that means you'll
see some variance from one notebook to
the other but for the most part they all
pretty much use i7s they're very similar
hardware other than that GPU component
so this will allow us to establish the
baseline
the review is coming up separately we've
got some thoughts on the notebook to
talk about in that dedicated review but
before getting to the testing a couple
notes on methodology notebooks are
tricky because notebooks in the review
world are all basically loners we don't
keep them like we do with a lot of the
other parts where you keep it because
you want to do regression testing has
drivers iterate as there are changes to
games game patches new games whatever
all that stuff changes so you want to
hang on to it so you can do regression
testing it's called
where you revisit an older piece of
hardware or you try and figure out
things as they iterate in
update notebooks aren't the same way
because there's such an expensive unit
to loan out for review manufacturers
generally don't give them out that means
that we are going based off of some
older tests here we've got some new
tests like Sniper Elite Four and
overwatch for the 1050 Ti but those
tests don't necessarily include things
like b gtx 1060 notebook GPU because
that one was on loan to us as was the
1080 notebook GPU we only have that for
Mordor and Metro last light and the same
is true for a couple of the others
however because we're mostly looking for
scaling anyway we can still rely on
those older game benchmarks which are
fantastic for the reason that they do
not update they are done with
development so we can trust that they
haven't changed there haven't been
driver changes because they're old
enough so that lets us look at scaling
and then we can look on an overview of
all results just for a baseline of where
the 1050 Ti is we're starting with the
chart over viewing the 1050 Ti laptops
performance and all the games tested and
we'll then move to the comparative
charts versus other GPS after testing
overwatch at 1080p with ultra settings
we land at around 92 FPS average in a
match or 105 average in our deprecated
training mode benchmarks these are only
caps for comparison versus the old data
since the scaling is still linear our
recent overwatch graphics optimization
guide discusses the new methods we use
for match testing which includes a
several minute long test pass for
another modern title Sniper Elite 4 with
DirectX 12 asynchronous compute enabled
and the high settings with 1080p
resolution places the tentative DTI at
54 FPS average those are at 43 and 40
FPS respectively 1% and jehan percent
this is reasonably playable given that
we're on a laptop grade piece of
hardware and have at different
tolerances than desktops looking nice to
GTA 5 we're nearing 60 FPS average on
the 1050 TI notebook
lo-lo's don't scale quite as well here
as another game so that's more of a game
level difference than a hardware level
difference something that we'll see when
we get to the GTA 5 standalone
benchmarks Hardware ultimately execute
the game though so we can draw some
limitations there as to how much the
game is responsible for but let's move
on to some comparative charts for the
older game this is one of the few games
where we have every relevant laptop GPU
present so we'll spend some time
here shadow of Mordor is a bit of a
throwback it gives us the most data 4%
of scaling comparison since we've used
it heavily for benchmarking dating back
to really a couple years ago at 1080p
with ultra settings with 1050 TI
notebook covers around 58 FPS average
that place is at approximately 22% ahead
of the gtx 970m notebooks the 970 m is
from before Nvidia's moved to a drive
desktop GPUs notebooks hence marking a
larger difference than you might see
between a desktop 970 and a desktop 10
to DTI the 1050 Ti does well in this
regard and the gtx 1060 msi ge62 v our
notebook runs at least 32 percent faster
with 77 FPS average which is also faster
than the mobile 980 m and the fan book's
corresponding cpu the GTO is 1070 is
next at 114 FPS average for a 48% speed
increase over the 1060 and about a 2x
speed increase over the 1050 Ti the GK X
1080 cleveo notebook is at the very top
with its 139 FPS average and we haven't
been able to get hands on with a 1080
notebook since the launch so this is the
only set of numbers that we have for
them
we've got more tests - but before that a
quick discussion on the numbers with
laptops the big question as is always
the case of laptops is how much you
really need it's not like a desktop
where you've got effectively unlimited
power you're not worried about battery
life and you can upgrade things like
your monitor to be more than what ever
comes with the laptop for instance so
with a laptop you're looking at if
you're stuck on a 1080p screen how much
do you need because as you increase the
GPUs capabilities so to decrease the
life of the battery if you're trying to
do any kind of actual gaming while
mobile or portable although that is
hopefully somewhat uncommon because
you're you're just going to murder the
battery in a matter of an hour or less
in some cases so the 1050 Ti so far with
our baseline overview results looks to
be doing pretty well it hangs on around
60 fps for the most part if not above by
this amount or slightly under and if
you're not concerned about hitting the
highest possible graphics quality
settings with a high frame rate it's not
a bad performer because with a notebook
ultimately you care about
other things as well like form factor
and battery life and the 1050 TI will
enable both of those better than some of
these other notebooks GPUs will so
that's one of the big things to consider
as we roll into the next set of
benchmarks we're down to games where we
have fewer devices present but can still
start showing differences between at
least the 10 60 and 1050 Ti with a
splash of other 900 series laptops the
1050 Ti runs Metro last light with an
average FPS of 51 outpacing the 970m
system by 26% the GTX 1060 unit runs
nearly 48 percent faster than the 1050
Ti putting out a frame rate which is
almost always above 60 fps with some
exceptions in the low department black
ops 3 is next and has always been fairly
well optimized this game places the 1050
TI notebook at 76 FPS average when
running the high settings with FXAA that
makes the tender DPI about 22% faster
than the 970 m notebook and makes the x
60 about 44% faster than the gtx 950 TI
notebook there's decent scaling here but
it again becomes a question of whether
or not you need the power when
considering other items for e notebooks
consideration again like form factor
cooling &amp;amp; noise and this is our
deprecated overwatch test we've since
replaced it with laun matched benchmarks
which we detailed in our overwatch
graphics optimization guide and in the
summary of results for this benchmark
because we're comparing against laptops
we no longer have access to you we're
looking at the numbers on the screen
here they're still accurate with regard
to scaling just a bit higher than what
you'd see in a match the tendency I
place is about 19% ahead of the 970 m
and 5700 HQ build would be 1050 at 40%
ahead of the gtx 750ti
this is fairly consistent with our other
numbers and isn't anything too exciting
and really any department but 1050 Ti
does pretty well with overwatch all
things considered so that provides the
baseline of where the GTX tension TTI
performs in notebooks obviously there
are some differences because not all
notebooks are going to be created equal
to 1050 Ti so the things to keep in mind
here are that our model had an i7 CPU so
if you're looking at something with an
i-5 which is pretty rare in notebooks
but can happen then the performance will
be different overall though this gives
us a baseline it was as percent scaling
to the 1016 the very least in some games
17:10 eighty we are testing the 1070
next and we'll be adding that so then
we'll have 1050 TI 1060 and a 1070 to
compare to
which is a pretty good set of benchmarks
for laptops the other immediate content
to follow will be our review of this
notebook so this was the GE 72 7r e
apache pro and we've also got another
ge62 to look at but the seven RT will
come first because it's there are some
interesting things with it we're
expanding our notebook testing a bit
