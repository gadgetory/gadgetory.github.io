nexus net and today we are looking at
the neverwinter mmorpgs gameplay
mechanics and the depth of play we first
looked at the game in our previous
character creation video where I walked
you through the basic classes races and
the tweaking of your appearance but now
that our team of three editors has had
time to play for the entire weekend I am
confident enough to voice opinions on
gameplay the game itself is based on
current Dungeons and Dragons the 4th
edition rule set which was purpose built
by Wizards to be easily accessible to
players of both tabletop and of course
online gaming experiences and while all
of the classes Paragons which are
effectively subclasses and abilities are
not yet integrated with neverwinter
online it did have much of its framework
in place for this past beta weekend and
a quick disclaimer this was a beta this
was the first beta weekend so I am not
really going to spend a lot of time
mentioning things that were bugs because
I think they'll be fixed but gameplay I
am fairly positive is set in stone so we
can talk about that for a crash course
on the background the game is based in
the Forgotten Realms universe and
specifically takes place and neverwinter
the city and its surrounding provinces
this is the same universe where baldur's
gate those games if you remember those
they took place in the Forgotten Realms
universe and of course the city of
baldur's gate and never wonder is
actually located just slightly north and
a little west of baldur's gate on the
sword coast as soon as you step foot
into the world of Neverwinter online
after the tutorial of course you're
greeted with a setting appropriate
really just entire city the architecture
is all setting appropriate there's high
fantasy style structures floating masses
of Earth up in the air with Citadel's on
top of them all kinds of crazy stuff
that is really just perfect for the
universe so I commend the developers
we're doing a good job aesthetically and
setting wise and the games overall
aesthetic is cohesive and matching the
they're even watering NPCs that breathe
a bit of life into the city you don't
always see that in most
was nice the controls feel mostly fine
animations are smooth and the basic
elements of combat are all fluid enough
but there's a major flaw that we noticed
immediately just on character creation
all the way through to whatever level we
played to this weekend and it kind of
grew and concerned us more as we
progress because we were noticing that
the problem was continual it was not
subsiding anytime soon so here's what we
noticed character customizations and
specifically ability options pathways
subclasses all the stuff overall depth
is what we're talking about of
development and are all incredibly
shallow and weak all of that stuff is
very weak from the get-go unlike the
tabletop game and unlike many other MMOs
out there neverwinter sort of drops you
into a universe with a flat template
race class appearance that's it then
sends you out on collection quests
courier quests and kill X of Y quests
almost immediately I think this is sort
of catering to the more novice audience
I feel like it's it's really appealing
to the people who need to be handheld
quite frankly all of us are fairly and I
say Azmi and everyone who is familiar
with gaming and RPGs especially we know
what we want to it comes to a character
you can come up with the concept very
quickly think of something really cool
and then just execute and you figure out
the rest as you go right as you level up
you learn about the game that's just how
it works but this is completely
templated so you're not different from
anyone else when you start here I mean
you're every other fighter so do keep
that in mind there's no hesitation when
it comes to getting right into the grind
either not even a honeymoon stage with
an alluring veneer sort of like rift has
a very cool looking introduction that
doesn't exactly follow through the
entire game although separate topic this
is I think this is likely due to the
games beta stage I feel like this will
change in terms of the introduction
that's probably a placeholder for now
but still kind of disconcerting quests
are nothing original honestly it's all
stuff that we've all seen before they're
really just used as an excuse to grant
additional XP when you're killing things
anyway it happened to be in the area
and in some cases I suppose it's a way
to force players to explore so there's
that I guess ? so yes the quests are
rather boring and bland but I can look
past boring quests if the gameplay is
there if there's enough character depth
heck yeah I'll play those crappy quests
all day long if I have a really cool
character to look forward to in the
future that's just--that's these games
are a trade off like that you can't have
it all but this game has neither right
now so first of all you're limited to
somewhere around eight or ten total
abilities on your bar including passive
abilities that to MMO gamers is not a
lot right you're used to three hot bars
or more at mid-range this is fixed
you're stuck with those and I can see
that working I could see myself playing
through rift with five abilities and
nothing else obviously not competitively
or anything but I can see it working if
it's done right the problem is it isn't
not neverwinter anyway so you have for
example I I'm not going to go to into
depth how this works but they're our
encounter abilities at will abilities
and daily abilities in fourth edition
some of us know how it works daily user
once per day encounter once per
encounter at will anytime okay very
simple in Neverwinter they have to
bypass some tabletop to desktop
logistics issues and instead just make
daily a effectively a charge up I hate
to use that phrase but think of daily as
you work toward it progressively as you
deal more damage so that's that
encounter is based on charges like a
magic wand might have three charges
before needs to be recharged okay so
it's just like that you deal damage it
recharges over time that's that and
that's that's really the end of it so
that's what you get you have a couple of
slots for each of these on your bars so
you might have two slots or encounter
abilities two slots right we'll of the
abilities and so on if you think about
this mechanically what that means is as
you progress through the game when
you're choosing between one ability or
another you really do not have a whole
lot of options you have to make choices
effectively based upon what number is
higher that's not too dissimilar for
most MMOs but most MMO
will at least disguise that in some kind
of other Shroud of story or cool
abilities for instance in Neverwinter if
you want to be a damage dealing fighter
vs a high hit point fighter tank fighter
the difference is it's really just stuff
like you have two percent higher health
or you have two percent more damage
that's so boring I can't even begin to
express it in thoughts partially because
it's 8am and i stayed up writing the
full article linked below all night but
it's just crazy boring so where do we
see the difference in normal MMO as well
for example you might see something like
if you wanted to make the fighting type
the damage dealing fighter you would
maybe see something more along the lines
of deal and extra two percent damage
with slashing weapons and have a chance
to inflict a bleed damage over time
wound on your opponent much more
interesting right because suddenly you
are now a slashing weapon focused
fighter so axes and swords which
differentiates you from the pack and you
have an ability that is useful in
certain situations bleed against
humanoid guys when you're trying to kite
or something like that so instantly
gives you a lot of options in combat and
separates you from the pack a bit more
which is what it all comes down to in
the end because otherwise you get stuck
in that why am I playing this game oh my
gosh did I just spend my whole weekend
playing that right so that's what I'm
talking about and it's all accentuated
by the fact that combat is so easy I
can't even express how easy it is for
the first I don't know a couple hours we
put maybe each put 10 hours into it this
weekend to collect them somewhere 2234
half of it you don't even need to use
most of your abilities you can get
through just holding down left click and
then as it does get harder there's no
actual difference between your enemies
it doesn't register in your brain I'm
fighting an orc or I'm fighting a
halfling they're all freaking the same
because they're all equally easy to kill
and equally unimpressive you're not
nothing psychologically ticks that may
she say I should run away from this guy
where I should be scared of this guy
because you know you're going to kill it
and your party is going to be fine
because the game is so really just
scaled I think a little bit geared
toward the low end where they're holding
hands too much maybe this is a beta
thing okay so I'm not going to like
eviscerate it because it is in beta so i
will granted that but if we're honest
you know at this point in the game it's
almost done so so just you know keep
that in mind we do have to look at it
fairly though so it's it's not
challenging you don't have a lot of
depth of customization all of your
customization options are just increased
numbers and one stat or another there's
not really any flourish to it there's no
really added like it's not fleshed out
you're not fleshing out your character
you don't feel like you're being super
awesome and different from everyone else
it just feels very templated and bland
and I think that's that's sort of the
statement for today and further a lot of
the skills that are specific to classes
for example Dungeoneering is fighter
specific thievery steve is a rogue
specific excuse me and religion is
cleric specific stuff like that those
skills which are class specific when you
encounter items that require them in the
dungeon it is often boiled down to its
trivialized to the point where it's a
difference of getting a piece of leather
or not it's a it's a crafting material
that you gain from using that's that
skill as opposed to what I'd like to see
like indie do dungeons dragons online
for example is something that requires
the party to work together to maybe use
their skills to unlock a secret door yes
we did encounter one secret door by
using Dungeoneering but that I mean that
was it compared to all the countless
pieces of leather I got for using it so
there's nothing really compelling the
player to use those skills and use them
together there's it's just not as
cohesive as I would like it to be I do
encourage you to read the full article
below it's it's fairly lon it goes into
depth on all of these thoughts and in a
very organized manner that lays out the
arguments cleanly so I highly her
that at the end of the day do I
recommend it sort of I think it's
actually a fun game if you're a novice
to MMOs or if you don't mind being
treated like a moron because it does
hold your hand quite a bit I I think
that sort of the novices to both D&amp;amp;D and
mmos will be that small niche where they
will be most entertained because it
doesn't feel overwhelming it doesn't
throw a ton of complexity at you it's
just like hey here's a character go have
fun you're not really going to see
anything you haven't seen before as an
experienced player so i don't think i
can honestly recommend it to experienced
MMO to the veterans out there if you're
a massive fan you know of Forgotten
Realms absolutely try it I think there's
like some I think it's all you can still
sign up for beta so definitely go do
that give it a shot don't take my word
for it but personally having played
thousands and thousands of hours of MMOs
and having played many years of tabletop
RPGs and having played far too many
games i'm looking at my shelf and just
seeing like hundreds of games it's kind
of terrifying far too many games to
count my thoughts are that this game has
a lot more a lot of potential can take
advantage of but it hasn't yet it hasn't
tapped into it and frankly I think it
may be too late to tap into it until
perhaps a further patch down the road
that's just what I think checked it out
for yourself if you would like to I i
would encourage getting your own opinion
on it read the article below for the the
more laid out arguments and structured
argument and with that I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
