Blow released popular puzzle platformer
braid on the xbox live arcade since then
he's been working nonstop on his second
game the witness which was recently
released in January on the 26th so what
is the witness well first of all we have
a full review on the website if you hit
the link in the description below that
will take you to the review but judging
from screenshots alone it would look
like a combination of missed with some
team fortress 2 ish art style thrown in
in reality it's less missed and more
Rubik's Cube the player starts in an
underground tunnel which then emerges
onto a colourful island filled with
mysterious buildings and machinery in
order to activate the machinery however
various puzzles must be solved so it is
sticking true to the puzzle element of
Jonathan blows games there are an
impressive 650 of these puzzles in the
game at least and in each one the player
is required to trace a path across the
screen usually through an obstacle
filled grid a big chunk of gameplay
however is just figuring out how these
obstacles work using clues from the
environment and from other puzzles in
fact it's difficult to describe the
game's mechanics without spoiling the
game but for example the player might
have to separate some colored squares
while outlining specific shapes simple
ideas like this are combined to become
increasingly complex throughout the game
and sort of per mutated on top of itself
becomes more and more complex as you go
in spite of this the game's greatest
strength is that it's practically
impossible to become one hundred percent
stuck the majority of puzzles are
optional since only a certain number of
areas need to be completed to reach the
home stretch and our reviewer Patrick
lathan had a total count of only 369
puzzles by the end of the game so that's
a bit over half of what's in there
clearly a lot of effort was put into
making the witness challenging enough to
be fun but not so much to encourage
cheating and that's a good thing too
since cheating would turn the whole
experience into a 30 minute stroll
around a pretty island and instead of
googling for an answer the best solution
is to find a simpler puzzle that
explains the rules of the more complex
one they sort of build on each other in
this way and that is very solid game
design that we
think underscores the value of a good
well designed puzzle game Jonathan Blow
estimates it would take about 80 hours
to solve all of the puzzles honestly
with no cheating and that's probably
conservative considering he made them
the ha moment of finally solving a tough
logic puzzle is the game's primary
reward and it's in a similar sense to
coding or plain su doku there are a few
hidden gems to be discovered but puzzles
are really designed to be solved for
their own sake and it's worth mentioning
that all the gameplay is made up of
these puzzles for those who don't enjoy
them if you don't like puzzle games and
don't even buy it it's not the right
game for you what lies beyond the
puzzles is really a matter of opinion
anyone who's played braid will be
familiar with Jonathan blows method of
storytelling which leaves plenty of room
for audience speculation in the witness
the bits of story that are revealed to
the player are never direct instead
they're delivered as sort of snippets of
philosophy Jonathan Blow even chose to
not include music in the game and
instead decided to create the perfect
atmosphere for the mildly sinister
deserted puzzle island without music the
downside is that anyone who found braid
sort of quoted what pretentious or
boring will probably think that the
witness is ten times worse so that's
just the downside of that the one it
should run okay at minimum specs thanks
to the new engine that Jonathan Blow
created and it uses a nifty dynamic
resolution feature which scales
resolution to down class for lighter
weight hardware like idps but it is
continuing to get regular updates with
patch notes like quote graphics drivers
are the worst thing in the world so I
don't know that I totally disagree with
that sentiment either I can totally
understand why developers would struggle
with graphics drivers because they are a
mess we are ourselves experience with
problems with AMD display drivers in
this game particularly the r9 285 but
hopefully that'll be taken care of soon
the witness is available now for the
fairly modest price of forty dollars
it's on Steam and elsewhere and has
already far outperformed braids first
year of release in just a single week so
it's certainly worth looking into if you
do like these kinds of challenging games
