we're looking at API performance between
DirectX 11 DirectX 12 on GPUs from both
vendors some of which are not shown here
and part of this look is to determine
whether or not DX 12 actually improves
performance on the whole with
battlefield 1 because as you all know
it's not always a positive gain before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by an tech and a new cube many
ITX case as designed by Razer and it's a
small box that supports a full custom
loop liquid cooling solutions in today's
battlefield 1 benchmark we're looking at
GP performance between the GTX 10 series
rx 400 series GPUs some of the 300
series GPUs and we've also got a couple
of 9 and 7 Series TVs one of them anyway
the 750 Ti this game as with all EA
origin games does have an activation
limit when you're dealing with Hardware
swaps for 24 hour periods 5 cards per
game code we have three game codes to
maximum of 15 cards we can test assuming
no screw-up so we are more limited on
what we can do because of the EA origin
de nouveaux stuff
let's talk methodology first since this
is always a question this will be more
intricately detailed than the article
linked below if you're curious about why
or how we did something check there
first because it probably answers the
question partner cards were used where
available and tested at for out of box
performance frequencies listed are
advertised clock rates we tested both
dx11 and dx12 using present Mon by Intel
Microsoft for the DX 12 testing and we
execute present mod using command line
then use our own in-house Python script
to rip out the average the 1% loan the
point 1 percent low FPS which
illustrates stutters as we've explained
before please note that we use on
present to measure frame times and frame
rate and methodology of course is
important so make sure you understand
what you're comparing results to if it's
odd present on display or even measured
using the same tools at all we use on
present and present Mon for DX for
benchmarks also note that we are limited
again on the activations for game code
so keep that in mind that battlefield 1
has a few critical settings that require
tuning for adequate benchmarking except
where otherwise noted we disabled the
GPU memory restriction for testing
because that triggers dynamic quality
scaling
creates unequal tests and we set
resolution render scale to 100% fields
of view was also changed to 80 degrees
to more appropriately fit what we think
a player would generally use on average
and that's from a default of 55 so this
impacts FPS of course and that's also
important vsync an adaptive sync are
disabled presets are used for quality as
defined by the chart titles game
performance also swings based on test
locations that matters to if you're
comparing generally a good idea by the
way not to compare benchmarks between
multiple testers without really
understanding where and how the things
are tested we tested in the Italian
avanti savoia campaign level sorry for
the pronunciation that's single-player
and we also tested on Argonne forest for
multiplayer you can view our test course
in a separate video already on the
channel the campaign was used as a
primary test platform but we tested
multiplayer to determine the scaling
between single-player and multiplayer
thankfully two are pretty comparable in
performance depends heavily on the map
as always but even 64 player account
servers assuming the map is arranged as
usual where you never see everyone I
want it's not too abusive on the GPU
here's some of that preliminary data the
game actually scales fairly linearly
between our test cases single-player and
multiplayer and note that as always
specific game events or the introduction
of a lot of geometric complexity at once
like multiple tanks on screen at a high
LOD will impact FPS similarly flying up
in the vacant sky or staring at
low-density objects will impact FPS in
the opposite direction for our tests we
have a planned mix of geometry effects
crepuscular rays and in-game events the
chart we've been showing reveals the
scaling between our multiplayer
non-repeated real gameplay benchmark and
the repeated single-player gameplay
scenario raw performance looks like this
table on the screen now if you want to
see a couple of raw numbers and that
sort of spoils some of our performance
results so let's just jump right into
DirectX 11 with 4k at high settings we
briefly tested with 4k at Ultra settings
as well to compare versus our final use
of high settings with 4k the two are
actually pretty similar in this scales
to 1440 1080 as well generally only
producing a couple of percentage points
difference a couple frames different but
still we settled on this chart for 4k
high testing EVGA is GT X 1080 FTW
hybrids to the top of the bench pushing
an average FPS of 69 with 1% low
63.1% loads of 56.7 and that's an
indicator of consistent frame times with
low latency and variance the gtx 1070 SC
operates at an average of 54 FPS for 4k
high with lows dip into 44 fps the fury
X is not far behind on these charts and
following these the msi r9 390x and gtx
1060 gaming x cards are effectively tied
in their averages and 1% lows with the
r9 390x imperceptibly favored in the
0.1% blows rx 488 gigabyte gaming X is
operating at 37 FPS average at 4k high
and these three cards the 1060 390 X and
480 are bordering on unplayable for a
higher speed shooter like this one if
you really wanted 4k gaming on these
devices which is probably not common you
would want to dip the settings closer to
medium let's look now at how the same
settings perform under dx12 with DirectX
12 enabled and using the same settings
otherwise the GTX 1080 is now operating
at 59.6 FPS average or about 10 FPS
lower than TX 11 and was significantly
worse 1% in 0.1 % lower values in DX 11
this is precisely why we use this
testing methodology because those
stutters would not appear in the data if
we just used averages you'd be relying
on subjective analysis and the stutters
by the way our perceptible and gameplay
a sudden hitches and frame latency
you'll feel a delay frame the frame
occasionally in the test passes but not
always and in this instance DirectX 11
should provide a smoother performance or
experience overall looking at the next
card down the gtx 1070 sits at about 48
FPS average with similarly low 0.1%
performance trailed next by the r9 fury
X and r9 390x the fury X has the worst
frame time performance on this chart we
suspect that this is at least partially
a result of its more limited vram both
390x is really not much better and we
believe that some of these frame time
hits are a result of dx12 memory
management falling more on the is of
ease then on the IH vs or the difference
of basically software vendor versus a
hardware vendor the ISPs are still
learning how to deal with memory
allocation for games with DX 12 Vulcan
and other low-level api's
so there's likely some performance and
optimization issues in there to be
worked out
but we don't know the full extent of how
battlefield
was built on dx12 let's move back to
DirectX 11 with 1440p and ultra settings
this time not high the GT X 1080 FTW
hybrid is chart-topping with nearly 120
FPS for those of you with 120 Hertz
displays if that's relevant it's running
1% in 0.1% low values north of 60fps and
has followed most immediately by the gtx
1070 SC at 91 at seven FPS average also
with tightly time to lows really almost
everything we're showing on this chart
is fairly playable at 1440p with ultra
settings including the RX for 80 gaming
x the RX for 70 isn't really the best
option but you could I guess tune
settings down too high to hit that 60
FPS marker if it's really desired and
granted again most rx 470 owners
probably are not running 1440p displays
in addition to their mid to low end card
I guess mid-range would be more
appropriate anyway the r9 fury X
outpaces the 1060 by about 8 FPS or
about 12% with the r9 390x following the
gtx 1060 by a few frames the cards
performing in these 60's will
occasionally dip when major in-game
events happen but should generally
remain playable at 1440p bouncing back
to DX 12 at 1440p ultra we now see the
GTX 1080 FTW hybrid is performed about
22% worse and it's averages than with
dx11 when we tested the same card in the
same settings in the same location the
lows also take a big hit dipping down to
22 FPS and the worst few frames of the
benchmark not the minimum but the worst
selection of the 0.1% lowest frames and
this is true across the board with
Nvidia holding slightly higher low
performance than Andy but both are
disagreeable so really it's irrelevant
who is higher than whom because you're
dealing with just poor performance in
the lows across the board the x12
performance in this case is not
beneficial to either vendor at least not
for the early stages of level we found
that once you kind of get into gameplay
and multiplayer things do smooth over
and performance improves a little bit
but you will have to endure a couple of
hitches in the first couple of minutes
the x12 performance remains poor all the
way down the stack when looking at
beyond present variants and then on
display would be a bit different but not
too much not every single test run
exhibits the variance but it happens
minimally four out of five times the rx
40 for instance had one pass pass with
1%
values at 61.5 FPS in 0.1 at 69 FPS both
completely agreeable though the other
test passes each exhibited at least one
or two noticeable stutters outputting
six FPS and the point 1% blows in about
30 and the 1% low is 1080p is still the
market Dominator with more than 80
percent of the market still on 1920 by
1080 displays as we understand it with
DirectX 11 and ultra settings 1080p
resolution debuts larger charts for us
that contain everything down to a 750 Ti
and an Rx 460 and the GT X 1080 FTW
hybrid is beginning to approach the
game's 200 FPS frame recap before
console modifications trailed by the gtx
1070 at 125 FPS average then the r9 fury
x at 100 FPS average all devices on the
bench have tight frame x from both AMD
and NVIDIA other than of course the
really low-end cards and as for those at
lower end cards you're looking at
basically a 750 Ti sub or around 30 fps
you'd want to drop to maybe medium
settings and the RX 460 and the 40s or
so so again probably drop to medium or
maybe mix of medium high settings up and
what you're going for and if it's a 2
gig or 4 gig our rx 460 as for cards
closer to a baseline 60 FPS for 1080p
ultra you'd be able to get away with an
Rx 470 pretty easily with its 75 FPS
average or a GTX 960 if you've got one
already right around 60 FPS average
here's the 1080p dx12 benchmark chart
you're looking at more of the same where
DX 11 is outperforming in the one 47.1%
low values and depending on which men
are you're looking at maybe even in the
averages generally we are recommending
DX 11 right now for battlefield 1
although again if you play for a bit it
will smooth over at least slightly and
as for one final chart this is a scaling
chart showing the performance gain or
loss from low medium high and ultra
this is Amalgamated from a couple of
cars but we didn't test on all of them
so it just gives you a way to
extrapolate performance if you're trying
to run it to lower setting for a certain
card as for the best cards for
battlefield 1 we're happy to report that
with this game with the drivers that are
out by the way all game ready drivers
the frame time variants is really not a
major issue with DirectX 11 for AMD or
for Nvidia so both of them are pretty
similar in that regard and DirectX 12 is
really the only place where it becomes a
variable but the low performance is
really technically it's worse on Andy
but they're both so bad
that it just doesn't matter some apps
are less bad than others sometimes it
gets smoothed out etc but because
averages are effectively identical for
AMD between the x12 and D X 11 and
because they're better for NVIDIA with
the X 11 and as a third point because DX
12 has more variants will be basing this
conclusion on dx11 performance again
even without the variance the average
framerate is effectively equal on AMD
between the two API is in a slightly
negatively scaled on nvidia this will
make the performance and dollar
arguments a little bit less complicated
for 1080p with ultra settings owners of
last gens at gtx 960 and r9 380 x will
be able to play reasonably well with a
few small tweaks down to high of 60 FPS
is strongly desired the RX 480 and gtx
10-6 these are both more than capable
performing at 1080p with the RS 480 a
few frames ahead in DX 12 though with
worse stutters and the gtx 1060 ahead in
the x11
both of these $250 cards scale well in
1440p and are fully capable of 1440p at
Ultra settings where we see frame rates
north of 60fps for each vendor if you
wanted to go cheaper for 1080p than the
RX 470 or RX for 84 gigabyte cards would
both be capable of handling 1080 ultra
with FPS greater than 70 FPS average and
videos GT x 1050 and 1050 Ti are also
worth considering but we can't post
through his reviews or benchmarks just
yet aside from the DX 12 variants the
game is fairly well optimized for either
vendor with again dx11 it's really not
bad on either vendor you could use a gtx
970 or up for 4k high or an r9 fury
accent up for 4k high if you've already
got one of those and then we'd suggest
looking at your ideal card's performance
and other games obviously if you're
buying a new one today for this game
check out performs with other games to
make your decision because for this game
really they all do pretty well and
they're really not too far apart from
each other but against recap 1080p is
easily done with an RX 470 gtx 960 one
could speculate that a 1050 TI would
probably be okay on 1080p but we don't
know just yet and then 1440p fine on a
1064 84 K 10 so DP reacts and that's
really all for this benchmark so as
