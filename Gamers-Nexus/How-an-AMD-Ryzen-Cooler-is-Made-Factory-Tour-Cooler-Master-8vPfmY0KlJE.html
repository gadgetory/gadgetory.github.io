have been made by Coolermaster for a
long time now and these recent revival
with its Wraith and spire class stock
coolers so our return to Coolermaster
for manufacturing and as part of our
recent trip to Shenzhen and donjuan we
visited the cooler master factories
responsible for making those and these
coolers today we'll be following an AMD
cooler through the process of assembly
and we'll be looking at some of the
machines used to manufacture the
different parts of an AMD stock cooler
if you've enjoyed our factory tours the
absolute best way to make sure we can
continue to afford these expensive
international trips is to support us via
the GN merch store you can pick up GPO
artifact in shirt designs for $20 g ends
critically acclaimed mod mats now
available in both large and medium GPU
teardown sizes blue tinted beer glasses
with gold rims and 3d laser etched glass
statues with g ends anniversary teardown
logo each containing a high detail
design with MOSFETs fans and VRMs hidden
within support these tours at store
gamers Nexus dotnet or click the link
below our factory tours allowed us to
see every type of machine used to make
the AMD coolers
although note that some of the machines
were busy making different parts
depending on what was going on that
particular day to make a single Andy
stock cooler is incredibly complex
before even getting to the final
assembly line where each part is put
together coolers have to travel through
many steps prior service mount
technology or s-70 lines are needed to
make the pc b--'s for RGB LED and fan
speed where the PCB will go through
pick-and-place machines conveyor belts
through ovens filled with lakes of
solder and automated optical inspection
fin stacks have to be stamped by large
machinery but they need tools builds
first fans must be built and assembled
plastic has to be injected to make the
shroud and heat pipes have to be filled
with liquid and sintered powder then
bent to size let's start our journey
with the aluminum fin stack tooling
before the fin stack itself can be made
a tool for the fin stack has to be
created cooler master has shell
upon shelves of tools some dating back
to about two thousand three or four but
solve these tools costing upwards of a
million dollars for a single case each
tool is good for a product lifecycle
without meaningful degradation of the
material tools are made by skilled
machine operators and technicians who
use large drills to pour holes into
metal slabs Machinery is also used to
cut holes out where the staff needs to
impact the sheet metal to shape it and
tooling can take up to 60 days to
complete depending on complexity of a
project and how many revisions are
required with cases taking longer this
is one of the biggest costs of the
entire operation case tooling can cost
in the hundreds of thousands of dollars
up to $1,000,000 for instance and CPU
cooler tooling isn't cheap either as for
what a tool is if you're not quite sure
a tool or tooling when referring to
something used to manufacture a case or
a cooler component it's really just a
large piece of metal with a template
stamped or drilled out of it that then
mounts the bottom of the large machinery
that does stamping or other work with
sheet metal to shape the final product
so a tool is just a large piece of metal
they can weigh hundreds of pounds and
it's tens of thousands if not hundreds
of thousands of dollars depending on the
complexity tooling often goes through at
least two iterations before final
approval although three is common these
are referred to as T 1 T 2 T 3 and so
forth
the first tool is typically a rougher
design with the second one fixing most
of the underlying issues once the tools
are done they're mounted to the multiple
stamping machine so that mass production
can begin Coolermaster uses largely
automated stamping for this process with
a tool mounted to the bottom of the
press to stamp out the shape and rid of
excess material aluminum is fed into the
machine and sheet metal form and from a
flat reel stamped by the tool and spit
out the other side as a thin stack after
traveling through the stamping process
multiple times this particular machine
was making GPU cooler fin stacks as
cooler master is the supplier of most
stock G view coolers on the market as
well but it also makes stock CPU coolers
like the one for the AMD r8 series
schoolers that come with rising
processors coolermaster has many of
these stamping machines across its
numerous factories with this particular
area this one shot of the factory
containing at least ten of them and as
for all the waste that you see spewing
out all the excess metal that's not used
when it's stamped from the sheet metal
that goes into the machine
that's recycled it's sold to a
third-party company that can bring it
off to get recycled in a different plant
that Coolermaster has only a third-party
relationship with so the metal can be
melted down and reused once the heat
sink is spat out it gets carted over to
a separate assembly area that we'll look
at later PCB manufacturing is also an
important part of this process and one
that's easy to forget this process goes
through an SMT line which we showed in
our gigabyte motherboard Factory video
the process is the exact same as every
other SMT line including that gigabyte
Factory the PCB is first well designed
of course but then it's sourced from a
third-party supplier then it gets run
through a solder paste machine with a
silkscreen
the solder paste applies to a surface
mount device mounting points on the PCB
after this the PCB goes through
automatic optical inspection or Aoi to
ensure the solder paste was properly
apply it next goes through
pick-and-place component placement which
uses a reel of up to ten thousand
capacitors resistors and other small s
of these to populate the board rapidly
some components can be in reels of even
a hundred thousand but the average is
kind of about ten thousand individual
parts per reel and those reels contain
one specific model typically a PCB as
simple as AMD's would only take a few
seconds to fully populate in one of
these whereas a motherboard would take
17 to 20 seconds just for this one part
of the line the board next goes through
a reflow oven and eventually is fed
through a piping hot furnace where
solder isn't melted down from a bar that
dips into the lake of solder and then
the PCB is fed through the molten solder
in such a way that only the exposed
contacts underneath come into contact
with that Lake of solder and these
machines or these furnaces run upwards
of about 250 260 degrees Celsius
depending
if relevant the PCB would also go
through dual inline package inand in
circuit testing but it depends on how
complex the project is and what the
customer has required for its Quality
Assurance or for its mandated checks
some of cooler masters factories even
dip PCBs manually and to solder hot
plates as shown in some of our footage
here but it all hinges on what the
design is how advanced it is and what
the customer calls for to learn more
about SMT line specifically watch our
gigabyte factory tour from a couple
weeks ago when we showed how a
motherboard is made heat pipes are the
next part on the roster we already have
a dedicated video on how copper heat
pipes are made they'll recap parts of it
here copper heat pipes have to be
shrunken on one side and welded and then
filled with copper powder and baked at
1,000 degrees Celsius for eight hours
this bonds the copper powder to the
inner walls of the heat pipe to create a
sintered copper heat pipe liquid is
later injected into the heat pipe in
quantities amounting to a few drops per
pipe at which point the heat pipe is
vacuum sealed and cut to size
after this the heat pipe gets bent by an
automated machine which holds and bends
the heat pipes then grabs them with a
robot arm to drop them into the bin we
sped through this section in this video
but if this process interests you
further we have a ten minute long video
exclusively dedicated to the creation of
copper heat pipes at color masters
factory we'll link that in the
description below heat pipes are now
ready to be delivered with the heat sink
to be assembled and soldered together in
the meantime fans have to be made for
the cooler cooler master also supplies
the fan here as shown in our other
content where we look at the and the
cooler but we have some footage from our
deep pool fan factory tour and because
these processes are largely the same and
automated we can look at the previous
footage to see how a fan is made fans
first have their wires soldered to the
small PCB that's internal this is done
by hand and by workers at the front of
the assembly line after this soldering
process the PCB and motor are assembled
into the hub and at the facility we've
previously filmed the fan blade assembly
is set upon the conveyor belt and then
fed into the machine with the fan frame
moves by robotic arm from one carrier
next a series of robotic arms can grab
and insert the bearing and bushings or
other parts into the fan using hoppers
that vibrate to move small components
around a track and toward a laser-guided
automatic arm and then another arm grabs
the blade from the opposite conveyor
belt moves it to a carrier moves it to
the fan housing the fan housing is fed
back into the center of the machine
briefly for an arm then pushes down to
secure the hub and the blades to the
housing although we're technically
showing case fan manufacturing here the
same steps for the most part are used in
all fan manufactures it's just that some
factories are less automated than others
there are a few differences though and
those come down to assembly particularly
with the blade which isn't the same in
the Andes stock puller so we need to
look at that too we've finally made it
to the actual and the cooler assembly
line the assembly line is just under 80
feet long for one of them and is
actually fairly straightforward the
assembly line starts with workers
loading individual pieces onto the
conveyor belt workers on opposite sides
will load the heatsink while others load
the fan and then others still load the
fans plastic housing the PCBs and so
forth next the LED diffuser and the fan
housing are loaded into a small press
that briefly vibrates and generates some
heat to bond the housings of the LED
reen more firmly for final assembly the
next worker grabs the fan and the fan
housing and secures the fan cable to the
housing with an electric screwdriver
after which another worker pins through
the four corners of the fan into the
housing and apply the metal retention
kit the cooler now goes through an
isolated room for a simple acoustic
check all they're looking for is whether
there's a catastrophic failure like
whining and the bearing and that's it
this quality check is used for all AMD
coolers through the line and again it's
not a specific decibel level or DBA test
that's done separately it's really just
to make sure there's no major issue
going out to the customer the more
detailed acoustic testing for DBA
measurements happens in cooler masters
semi anechoic chamber with a noise floor
of about 6 DBA
but only during the design and
validation phases of the product once
the spec is set and the variance is
known this room is no longer needed for
mass production products and can instead
be used for upcoming designs and new
products and the pipe
one after the small testing room the
heat sink fan assembly has come back out
via conveyor belts and are tested for
RGB functionality and fan rpm
performance there is a usual rpm
variance in most fans of about plus or
minus 10% from one to the next so
workers look for variance defined by the
spec and pass or fail the device we
should note that the fans have already
undergone previous quality checks during
the initial manufacturing so this is
really just to make sure it still works
after all those assembly steps prior
software is used to measure performance
of multiple fans and pass or fail each
cooler and next the stock thermal paste
is applied to the cooler from large tubs
using a template and acrylic spreader to
apply a uniform layer of paste to the
bottom of the cooler some companies like
ASA tack use silk screens for this but
cooler master just uses an acrylic and
metal template that fits cleanly over
the cooler cold plate and then they
spread it over the cold plate as
necessary the next station is a taping
machine where the cooler is packaged
into the plastic carrier and where its
companion cables are taped to the
carrier finally the coolers are boxed in
the Andy black box and eventually
palletized for shipment out of the
factory and to wherever they may go next
that's it for this tour as stated some
of these clips we've shown are from
technically other products being made
but the way it works is each day
different parts of the line or making
different products so there's never a
point where you've got one product going
through every single step in the line in
order to keep things efficient companies
will move maybe thin stack a through the
stamping machine today and then they'll
move fin stack B through it tomorrow
meanwhile assembly is happening already
for product C and so you never quite
have everything line up especially since
we're only at each factory for one day
but the same steps apply we got to see
all the machines used in making the Andy
coolers and in fact these are the same
steps to use to make just about any CPU
cooler but we did get the excellent
opportunity of seeing the specific
assembly line for those AMD coolers that
are used in the rise in processors and
of course we're sure many of you are
interested in specifically that part of
things so thank you for watching
