well last year for the 1000 series it
was really the r5 series that ended up
taking all of our awards and critical
acclaim the r5 1600 X and 1600 were some
of the best CPUs put out last year I
think we even called the 1600 x2 the
best basically for anything in kind of a
gaming build price class so we like
those a lot and that's why this review
the r5 2600 X and 2600 is the one that
we think you should be paying attention
to for a non-production focused build
that might still be doing some kind of
streaming with gaming alongside it
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal Grizzly makers of the
conductor hot liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures Thermal Grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds were
used on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydronaut pastes learn more at the link
below there's some required watching for
this one go check our our 720 700 X
review before we get into this there are
a lot of things that we talked about
there I'm not going to go over them
again go watch that one if you want it
the basics here the 2600 2x is a 3.6
gigahertz to 4.2 gigahertz part the 2600
9x comes down to three point four and
3.9 gigahertz you can overclock them two
equivalents and we're not going to
bother overclocking both because they're
the same thing so if one is at 4.2 and
the other is at 4.2 their performance is
equal the 1600 X in the 1600 just frame
of reference maxed out at 4 gigahertz
roughly and beyond that again very quick
recap the biggest advantage Verizon to
over isin one was not raw performance
that's kind of boring if you're looking
for huge gains because that more or less
mirrors intel's gradual stepping over
the years for raw performance but that's
okay what I am the improved on was not
FPS really that much they bit yes but
what they really improved on was the
minimum required voltage to sustain a
fixed frequency ie 4 gigahertz
where it's significantly lower and power
consumption at that fixed voltage and
frequency is significantly lower that's
the improvement watch the other video
for it so get it into this one then
we're gonna start with streaming back
marks you can check the article for
additional information if you have any
questions about this stuff will go into
blender some games and then we should
pretty much have a good idea of where
the 2600 series falls we're gonna open
up with streaming benchmarks for these
CPUs today quick explanation again most
of its in the previous video are in the
article but we're taking a baseline
measurement versus streaming
measurements so we're looking at
framerate
during a stream at 10 megabits per
second with faster for the h.264 preset
or 12 megabits per second which is less
relevant and h.264 medium for the preset
which is functionally a stress test
using medium is basically a synthetic
test
just in case we deliver 100% of frames
which is our target with h.264 faster so
that we can still see which CPU is
better in an objective forced
environment where they are demanded to
push harder than they need to otherwise
the goal is to deliver 100% of frames
encoded successfully to the viewer while
also maintaining a playable good quality
framerate for the streamer so we have
two charts the streamer side chart and
the viewer side chart where they need to
come together and meet a good medium
otherwise the products no good for that
particular task we are streaming pub G
and dota 2 for our first round of tests
we use gigabit internet we log for any
kind of network or packet issues there
were none and then we do all the other
measurements including power and thermal
measurements as we do the testing so
we'll get to some of those as well for
streamer side fps and pub G the if5 8600
kaise baseline stock performance
permitted a 138 FPS average frame rate
which butts it up against the FPS cap
and the average would stretch it a bit
higher without that consideration those
are well times insofar as pub G anyway
which has issues with spurious frame
times than the 0.1% low range the r5
2600 ax stock operated a baseline
performance of 127 FPS average with lows
function equal or indistinguishably
different from the 8600 kalos the 8600 k
technically maintains a lead of 8.7
percent but again this is only half of
the equation and arguably the less
important half at 10 megabits per second
and faster h.264 the ad 600 k only drops
10 fps and the same is true at 12
megabits per second with the
much more intensive medium and code
setting this would indicate that
scheduling is keeping the entire gaming
workload on the Intel CPU with limited
resources made available for streaming
we'll check back soon on that the r5
2600 X drops much harder and framerate
so the loss as an offset from baseline
is greater at a dip of 30% reduced from
the non streams performance but we don't
know what that means yet what we know
for sure for now is that the player
would likely be satisfied with the
performance on either CPU for the most
part of live streaming
although Intel holds an objective
streamer side frame rail advantage one
left stock without priority or affinity
tuning moving on to the viewer side
chart here is where those numbers
manifest Andy is 30% drop for streamer
side performance proves a worthwhile
sacrifice because it's able to
successfully encode 100% of frames for
the stream the 8600 K which maintained a
much better framework for the streamer
completely crumbles went under the load
of even faster settings for encoding
which is not that intensive you can get
this to work but it required dropping
the encoding quality further and tuning
some affinities and priorities for
example you'd come down to ultra fast
lose some quality speed up the encoding
and then maybe play around with the
bitrate just in case at our reasonable
realistic quality of faster at 10
megabits per second baby 600 K struggles
to keep up one left stock and untuned
and just to be clear affinities and
priorities help as well for media we're
looking at a synthetic tests as we noted
to illustrate outside of margins at
which CPU is clearly superior if that
hadn't already been made clear MD claims
the flag for this test managing to
deliver 26 percent of its frames under
the strain of a medium and coding speed
while Intel gets clobbered down to a
handful of frames delivered it's not
even a slideshow it's just a picture
now as for how useful this is that
depends what you're seeing on the screen
right now is a video playback of both
streams at 10 megabits per second this
is about the quality we stream to
YouTube when we're being conservative
with our own live streams and the six
core 8600 K has a hard time managing
both the stream and the game
simultaneously
again capping the game and prioritizing
resources would certainly help
but the 2600 X doesn't require any of
that treatment it's just good to go out
of the box the 2600 exa has
substantially more headroom to sustain a
higher quality stream with pub G both
are capable of streaming it just depends
on how much quality you want and how
much you want to be under the hood to
work on the 80 600 K it's a bit of a
project car in that regard which is
ironic for reasons we'll discuss
momentarily power consumption while
streaming pub G especially is also
interesting clamps at the EPS 12-volt
rails the Intel i5 8600 K only ever
draws between 37 watts for baseline non
streaming performance and 65 watts for
streams output there are five 2600 exit
baselines at 62 watts with streaming at
111 to 114 watts that's a significant
increase over the Intel CPU but it's
also accomplishing the tasks that we
asked it to do and that's fair the i7
8700 K drives about 48 watts baseline or
98 to 105 when streaming the r7 2,700 X
poles between 68 watts baseline 135 for
a heavy stream this is also why AMD is
TDP rating will confuse people it's not
the same number as straight up power
consumption as we explained in the 2,700
X review from yesterday for dota 2
streamer side framerate positions the r5
2600 X baseline at 141 FPS average led
by the 80 600 K at 182 FPS average this
isn't uncommon for dota which tends to
favor frequency at least somewhat or on
the face of it intel has a substantial
lead but again we have to defer to the
viewer experience chart for more
streaming on the 80 600 K doesn't hurt
our framerate too much beam us down to
20 FPS average to 161 FPS average total
as for the viewer experience here's what
it looks like when left completely
untuned by the player it's not so good
for the ad 600 K as illustrated plainly
here even though these streamer is
getting over 160 FPS average during this
time period the viewer gets one frame
every now and then one FP and 80 as we
affectionally college it's our new
metric one thin at it's equal to one
frame every now and then the upshot is
that when it does eventually come up a
frame it's 58% while you need to be
within 16 window in milliseconds its
delivery window not very good actually
the r5 2600 X at 10 megabits per second
faster doesn't have these problems and
delivers
hundred percent of his frames it may
sustain a lower streamer side framerate
but the stream itself is perfectly
delivered outside of a ten percent
variance frame delivery timing and these
frequency deficit contributes to the
lowering of its heart FPS but its threat
advantage is what grants at the outright
lead in streaming while gaming
specifically those two things at once
for what is worth we did try setting OBS
the high priority on the a 600 K that
helped but you're entering into
territory where the player has to do
more hands-on tweaking before something
to work it's a bit ironic really since
this is the situation AMD was in just
one year ago with rise ins messy lineup
of launch biases and motherboards now
a.m. these platforms relatively mature
and stable but Intel's i5s requires some
help to pass the test moving on from
streaming to production blender is one
of rise ins at strong points like we
showed in the 2700 X video the in-house
3d rendering scenes that we used for
blender starting with the jeon
monkeyhead
show that the 2600 and 2600 x do quite
well they are 6 cores 12 threads and
blender really cares first and foremost
about threads and then a little bit
about frequency after that the
monkeyhead render finished in about 28
to 29 minutes on both the 2600 and 2600
2 minutes behind the r7 1700 x stock CPU
this is serious performance considering
the 1700 X runs two additional cores and
that's significant in the world of
perfectly scaling at render software
overclocking is again completely
pointless here XF r2 does the job mostly
for us and we had no Headroom to get a
4.3 gigahertz on our CPU for comparison
the 8600 K at 5 gigahertz it barely
manages to finish it surrender in 33
minutes granting the 2600 x8 13% time
reduction not bad at all perhaps more
impressively our gianna logo render
applies a different type of load and
stress to the CPUs going to gaming next
Assassin's Creed origin starts us off at
1080p for this one the r5 2600 x stock
CPU plays is at 102 FPS average with low
is at 77 fps and 66 fps these numbers
are all reasonable and scale from the
stock 1600 X
placing at 94 FPS average by about 8.6
percent from last year's model that's
with both stock overclocked
2,600 X at 4.2 gigahertz pulls a lot
more power and gains negligibly in the
FPS Department at 103 FPS average a 1.5
percent increase and just outside of our
error margins for this game
the overclocked to 1600 ex lands at 95
FPS average are also gaining negligibly
the r5 2600 9x CPU which operates a
frequency of three point four to three
point nine runs the test at 97 FPS with
it low is about the same as every other
rise in five CPU on the chart compared
to the r7 2700 X stock CPU operating at
107 FPS average performance uplift
versus the stock 2600 X is about 5.7
percent of course at 1440p all of that
equalizes like we demonstrated in our
2700 X review the difference is
primarily thin down to just Intel and
AMD where we see about a 10% gap between
them maximally other than that once
we're intra architecture there is
functionally zero difference in a GPU
bound benchmark moving on to watch dogs
- we measured the r5 2600 x stock CPU
using X 470 as performing that 1 to 3
FPS average with gns found in 1% and
0.1% low is at 80 fps and 62 FPS
respectively overclocking gets us an
increase of 1.6% and is entirely not
worth it a result of X of our two
functionally being as good as a manual
overclocked when pushed against the
limits of ambient cooling the 2600
operates a couple percent behind the
2600 X as expected the stock 1600 X runs
at around 93 FPS average allowing the
stock 2600 ax an 11 percent lead before
overclocking but again they can
overclock to the same frequency
basically the competing i-580 600k
outperforms the 2600 X by about 3.1
percent on both our stock overclocking
gets the 80 600 K up to 116 FPS average
a lead of 10.7% over the overclocked to
2600 X at 4.2 gigahertz while also
retaining higher 1% in 0.1% low frame
time performance as expected 1440p for
watchdogs to equalizes this to some
extent just like in our 2700 X review
that you should definitely watch the
Intel processors retain a bit of a lead
but all the intra arc CPUs that remain
close in performance that's Intel and
AMD project cars - at 1080p plants the
80 600 K 5 gigahertz overclocked right
alongside the 5 gigahertz 8700 K
illustrating that project cars favorites
clockspeed over nearly all else this is
further demonstrated when overclock
scaling the 2600 X doc CPU operates at
110 FPS average with an overclocked
granting all of one FPS within test
variants and function equal in
performance the 2600 operates at 106 FPS
average granting the 2600 X doc CPU
elite at 4%
this vanishes when overclocked in the
2600 which is trivial compared to the
1600 X stock CPU the 2600 X stock
operates at one time fps to ninety seven
point eight FPS average or a twelve
point seven percent lead generationally
between them each 2700 X doesn't offer
much of an improvement in this
department with its efforts more
noticeable under blender or streaming
applications project cars at 1440p
mostly just shows more of the same
scaling primarily vanishes between the
same arc CPUs with Intel holding a bit
of a lead both our GPU bottlenecks so
we're basically reviewing a GPU at this
point more than anything
conversely to project cars ashes of the
singularity can actually leverage
additional cores although it does like
frequency to some extent for this one
the i7 8700 ka 5 gigahertz leads the
charge at 56 FPS average followed by the
overclocked r7 2700 except 4.8 gigahertz
with 51 FPS average the overclocked 1700
isn't far behind
let's trade in why we'd suggest sticking
with Rison 1 if you already have it and
the I 580 600 K at 5 gigahertz runs at
47 FPS average about equal to the stock
r7 2700 and with frame times also
equivalent the 2600 ex stock Seaview
pushes 43.9 FPS average with an
overclock providing not ena value the
2600 is a single digit behind and can be
overclocked to make up that ground
finally further down the 80 600 k stock
CPU operates at 41 FPS average similar
scaling is what we've seen elsewhere we
test turn times for civilization 6 but
the game recently got a huge update that
completely upended our previous testing
and we had three tests as a result of
that the 2700 AK stock CPU finishes each
turn at 11 point oh five seconds with
all five turns taken about 55 seconds
for this particular round overclocking
reduces the time requirement to ten
point eight eight seconds for a 1.5%
time reduction the 8700 K stock CPU our
rates at ten point seven five seconds
not a huge change with the overclocked
variant at ten point one seven seconds
and neither is really particularly
game-changing here civilizations update
has tightened term times to a point of
limited usefulness in benchmarking at
least with these kinds of parts although
it's still highly consistent and a
unique benchmark for the CPU so we kept
it the 2600 x performs similarly to the
80 600 k and everything else really
there's not a lot of difference in these
tests GTA 5 is our last one at 1080p GTA
5 post the 86 hundred K stock CPU at 136
FPS average with a significant
performance uplift of 11% whatever clock
to 5 gigahertz the 2600 X at 116 FPS
average operates about 4.7 percent ahead
of the 2600 9x and about 11.5% ahead of
the original 1600 X and it's 104 FPS
average granted overclocked into for
0.05 nearly ties that matchup 1440p for
GTA 5 demonstrates again that we hit a
GPU bottleneck at 130 FPS average with
the overclocked 8600 kt 700k both within
margin of error of one another the 2600
X runs close to where it did at 1080p
around 115 FPS erage which is what you'd
expect for power consumption we plotted
the r5 2600 9x at 81 watts at the EPS
12-volt rails for Cinebench
multi-threaded landing it between the
1600 x stock and 1700 stock from the
first generation the 2600 x draws about
113 watts at the rails and our tests
with the 2600 x overclocked at 130 watts
a completely unworthy Linde ever given X
afar to it'd be more worth it for the
non X CPU to overclock for frame of
reference the 2700 x stocks if you
measured 1 45 watts or 192 and
overclocked this is largely because AMD
its board partners are blasting the 2700
x the more voltage is unnecessary when
stock as you can see in our first video
the 2700 x review again then we're
getting to a point where rise ins
generational improvements in terms of
raw numbers for framerate
other metrics of performance time are
not necessarily all that impressive
that's because the reference point we
have is going from FX to Rison
so of course that was gigantic FX was
not very good not at these kinds of
workloads that we're testing that's an
objective fact so to move from FX
Rison obviously it's gonna be a huge
jump performance for everything
IPC multi-threaded performance the
architecture is completely overhauled so
you're not gonna get that again for a
very long time and that's okay
stability is good anyway so the games
are not impressive enough that if you
have Rison one you should feel bad about
buying it if it was recent or verizon -
there's you should do neither of those
things if you have verizon one unless
you're on like an r3 and you want to go
to an R 7 then do it I guess
but if you don't presently have a rise
in CPU or a current Intel CPU these are
worth considering the r5 2600 much like
the r5 1600 falls in basically the same
place as the 1600 did for us which is
it's one of the best CPUs strictly in
terms of the value $200 plus or minus a
bit if you go the extra out and that's
good price
it does reasonably in games it's not the
outright best all the time but it
doesn't need to be and it's very
competitive in multi-threaded benchmarks
that are more production focused so if
you do any amount of that stuff blender
or perhaps streaming as we showed
earlier in the video then the 2600 is a
very good consideration we would
recommend you buy the non X version that
we just showed you and then overclock it
and it will basically become an X maybe
you you are a hundred megahertz lower
not a big deal
you still get most the performance so
that's throughout we'd recommend taking
if you're just building a straight
gaming PC Intel still has value in that
department Intel's high fives have
weakened a lot in the last year or so
and they got helped a bit with the six
core version of the i5 but AMD does have
a bit of an advantage in the I 5 r5
equivalent Department it's not until you
go up to the 8700 K that Intel's
basically the very clear and obvious
winner we'll call it in most of the game
benchmarks but that doesn't mean it's
the best for everyone so watch the 27 rx
review if you're considering the 87 hard
K pick between them based on that and
the r5 2000 series is every bit as good
as r5 1000
with a couple of improvements that are
significant primarily in the minimum
voltage required to run a fixed
frequency department that we talked
about in the first video but otherwise
not that exciting in terms of raw
percentage increase for frame rate so if
that's what you're looking for you
didn't get it but there are plenty of
other cool things that we got out of
this so thank you for watching subscribe
for more we have a lot more of these
videos coming up very soon
lots of them go to patreon.com/scishow
given axis house up directly so the
story I came is excess net to pick up
