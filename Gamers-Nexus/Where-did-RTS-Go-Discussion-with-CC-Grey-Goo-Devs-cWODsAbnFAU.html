nexus that we were at the grey goo booth
here at PAX Prime 2014 i'm joined by pat
one of the lead designer on gray goo and
that you worked with westwood studios
you worked with a lot of RTS in the old
days and coming up to now absolutely and
so there was a lot of RTS in the 90s wat
r GS in the late to late 90s early 2000s
where did it go so RTS gotta split in
two directions on the one hand you have
the ultra complicated micro intensive
you know unit abilities a whole lot of
stuff to keep track of and it kind of
turned a few people off there's a lot of
people authors are really good at it but
for the more casual crowd they just
couldn't get into it because it was just
too much the other direction when it was
mobis a lot more simple single character
unit abilities and upgrades through
itemization a leveling but it gets a
little repetitive after a while because
you know you got your characters if you
want to try something new it's the same
map over and over again the original RTS
County got lost in there somewhere and
so we just to give the viewers an idea
of what you worked on what were some of
the earlier RT has titles you worked on
my original starting design position was
tiberian sun i was a lead designer of
the firestorm expansion for that game i
worked on a few other tunnels for west
with students before it closed down and
started working for petroglyphs so i've
been a designer on empire or forces of
corruption universal war and now Bray
goo where do you see RTS as a genre
going in the near future um I think RTS
is here to stay and it's really up to
the player to pick what kind of star
they're looking for grey goo is more of
a simplistic old-school kind of feel to
it no unit abilities all the things that
units can do are built in you don't have
to worry about not a lot of micro it's
still micro there there isn't any RTS
you don't have to have uber micro to
actually play the game what is it you
think that makes RTS such enough healing
genres have people like us who played it
for whole lives so when I first started
history has explained to me by bretts /
he was the president of Westwood he's
like RTS is like toy soldiers that you
play with as a kid that you can move
around in real time and that's really i
mean the ultimate fun of RTS is getting
a whole bunch of stuff and attacking
your friends blowing stuff up and having
a good time big big giant battles lots
of explosions and cool stuff to play
with and it sounds like you're sticking
to kind of that philosophy or three gear
yeah definitely yeah i gue is something
I haven't personally seen anywhere else
it's just a big giant ball protoplasm
that rolls are on the screen eat stuff
splits into new units and ssf breaks all
the rules you can climb up the sides of
cliffs and mountains the only thing
can't do is build aircraft so that's its
one weakness and as a genre with RTS do
you feel like there's a lot of
competition out there right now do you
feel like it's a kind of open market for
you guys um well there's always the big
behemoth Starcraft and they're not going
away and we don't want it to because
it's an awesome game but for this level
our chest I don't think there's a lot
out there right now there's been a
couple that are in the works on steam
machine but I don't think there's
anything really that kind of scratches
that bread beer at Brussels kind of
feeling so you comparing between
something like Starcraft
grey goo fall on the difficulty spectrum
do you see that's a little easier for
users to get into or yeah I think so we
tried aim somewhere between the original
command conquer and starcraft so it's
not nearly as fast pace to starcraft is
you're not going to be measuring actions
per minute when you're playing but for
those people that are new to the game
they can sit down get into it have some
fun if you're a skilled player you're
going to find those little tricks and
tips that you can exploit and become a
really good player in terms of macro and
a great do what's the what's the macro
play like so it's the basics of RTS
right you have your resources you have
your unit production and then you have a
combat the there's a lot of map control
and grey goo we have elevation we have
line of sight and then we have factions
like the goo that can actually break the
rules they can climb over things that
break line of sight and look down on
anyone you can't see them so it depends
on the faction matchup is how much macro
you're going to have to worry about
were you able to borrow any design
elements from your command and conquer
command conquer experience it's a great
year oh absolutely i mean always call
Artie has experience right so when we
were building the factions we wanted to
build a play styles rather than just a
mill defection from scratch so we looked
at the play styles of RTS players and
there's your turtle guy you got your
rusher guy and then you got the people
that are somewhere in the middle so we
built the factions around those ideas
the goo is a massive aggressive rushing
style the humans are very much a turtle
defensive style and then the beater some
kind of somewhere in the between where
where can viewers go to learn more about
it what's the release date all that
information we're looking at early 2015
on steam it is steam multiplier and
lands so those of you that wanted is to
LAN parties offline you can go ahead and
do that you can visit w WG I am to find
