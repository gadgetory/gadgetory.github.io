manufacturers to differentiate a top of
a suppliers product like the ASA tech
Gen 5 pumps but you'd be surprised at
how much goes into them behind the
scenes and the XT for example was the
first manufacturer permitted to build a
fully custom and complex PCB for its RGB
eliminated cracking coolers followed up
in short order by EVGA who dropped price
significantly for the same sized
radiators while still instituting RGB
we're reviewing the new EB GAC LC 240
today following up our previous CLC to
80 and 120 reviews and we'll be looking
at the noise normalized performance
along with total performance overall
this video is brought to you by the be
quiet dark bass pro 900 white Edition
the DBP 900 marks a return to full tower
cases equipped with ample harddrive
support effective noise damping foam
high performance fans and the option to
be inverted into an alternative layout
the tinted tempered glass window and Qi
charger at a high untouched to an
already well-built case
learn more at the link in the
description below to quickly recap the
first two reviews of EVGA CLC units the
CLC is named because they're closed-loop
coolers came out earlier this year the
120 and 280 were first and both use ASA
tech John 5 pumps to get you up to speed
something like the courser h 100 IV 2 is
also an ASA tech pump as is the entire
NZXT kraken series the fractal Celsius
series and basically 80% of coolers in
the US market if not more at this point
so the CLC 240 is new it's a smaller
radiator obviously than the 280
it's priced at 110 dollars you can get
about 100 with a rebate if you count
those and that's the exact same price as
the H 100 IBT which is also priced at
$110 also with a $10 rebate if you count
those if not they're both 1/10 the CLC
280 we originally liked for value
proposition versus other 280 millimeter
coolers a lot of this comes down to the
fact that unlike NZXT EVGA CLC's are a
lot more simplified in terms of the LEDs
and the illumination and software and
things like that
but it allowed
them to compete right in between where
the Corsair h-series coolers h1 15i and
the NZXT crack and X 62 coolers landed
and the 280 at $130 was and remains a
good value the EVGA CLC 120 we didn't
really like at all it was pretty poor
performing overall it really made no
sense to buy it because you could spend
a couple dollars more and get a 240
millimeter H 100 IB 2 which offered
significantly better cooling performance
with better noise levels so the EB J now
has its 240 millimeter option which will
more or less kill the 120 except in
specific use cases where you can't fit a
240 and that's what we're reviewing
today so we'll look at the 240 versus
the kraken and Corsair cooler is along
with everything else we have on the
bench just as a reminder here because
it's been a while since we've gone
through some of the testing methods we
account for ambient temperature every
second so that's that goes into a sheet
we can monitor it second a second we
account for power consumption by the CPU
at the EPS 12-volt rails which means we
can monitor if the CPU draws more power
and one test versus the other because if
it does it's an invalid test because
power equals Heat at the end of the day
and we also account for voltage and
frequency locking them to be the same
thing so it's fixed it's not automatic
it doesn't change and then after that
point we run the standard test at max
rpm and then we run a noise normalized
40 DB a test where the cooler is tested
for noise levels at 20 inches away from
the cooler at which point we determine a
40 DBA rpm and test again at that rpm
for thermals starting with the torture
test that's just max rpm for everything
EB GAC LC 240 cooler performs
exceptionally well it lands at around
two cooling levels of the slowed-down
rpm for the kraken x 62 or slowed-down
c LC 280 the advantage of course still
goes to the larger coolers by operating
at 1500 rpm X 62 can match the maxed out
CLC 240 perforins thermally but at
significantly lower noise levels we'll
look at those in a mo
the same is true for the CLC 280 page
115 IV 2 and so forth these roughly
matched the CLC 240 performance but with
lower rpm at thirty four point nine six
Celsius over ambient the CLC 240 place
is marginally cooler than the ek fluid
gaming with course there's H 100 IB two
fans compared to the max rpm H 100 IB
two at 2500 rpm the CLC 240 manages
about a one degree Celsius advantage
that was awfully close to our tolerances
for error considering even just a plus
or minus 0.5 degree Swain would equalize
them these are pretty close to the same
that EVGA does hold a lead here strictly
in terms of noise at the peak rpm which
is what most of our previous charts and
numbers were based off of EVGA manages
to lay claim to the loudest cooler on
the charts at fifty eight point one DBA
the CLC 240 is rivaling 100% rpm noise
levels out of blower fans from reference
GPU coolers at this noise level we're in
in tolerable levels of whirring but we
obviously have full control to reduce
that noise level as necessary well we
have now our numbers representing peak
their own performance and worst case
noise performance for reference the CLC
280 at 1500 rpm matches the 2500 rpm CLC
240 in terms of thermals but operates at
45 DBA verses 58 DBA that's what you get
with a larger cooler this is more than a
two times perceived reduction in noise
as decibels are a logarithmic scale so
as far as the human is concerned to the
human ear you've dropped more than 2x
the noise by going to the 280 with the
same thermal performance the crack
connects 62 at 1500 rpm is in the same
boat achieving lower noise and
equivalent performance that's again the
value but let's move on to the noise and
normalize thermal chart where we can
figure all coolers the output at 40 DBA
and then thermally bench them normalize
that 40 DBA on all coolers plus or minus
about 0.5 the 280 millimeter and 360
millimetre coolers predictably land at
the top of the chart this consists of
the 280 millimeter NZXT X 62 at 1200 rpm
leading at 35 degrees Celsius delta T
over ambient it also consists of the 360
millimetre Celsius at 1350 rpm at 37
degrees C over
ambient and the 280 millimeter H 115 I
at 38 degrees Celsius I over ambient we
next hit the 40 C mark with the ek fluid
gaming 240 open loop kit cooling only
the CPU and then we encountered the CLC
240 at 1250 rpm from EVGA the ek fluid
gaming kit and EVGA CLC 240 are
functionally equivalent in our noise
normalized cooling test as 39.9 C and
40.3 C fall within usual variants of our
test and we can't really determine at
that resolution which is better anyway
so they're functionally the same in this
test Corsairs competing 240 millimeter H
100 ib2 falls behind at 42 degrees
Celsius one noise normalized and as the
closest thing to competition on this
newer charge age 100 IB 2 is the same
price as the EVGA CLC 240 so EVGA does
command a small victory here but a two
degree difference isn't much of one to
phone home about you can buy either
cooler knowing that they perform
reasonably at 40 DB a particularly given
that they're the same size and about the
same price but be aware obviously though
there are differences in other aspects
for example EVGA has its led options
whereas the H 100 IB 2 is a plain and
doesn't have RGB LEDs in it whether
that's good or not is up to you so this
comes down to the price then which is
$110 for the H 100 IV 2 and EVGA CLC 240
they're about the same price they're
pretty close and performance EVGA
outperforms a bit when noise normalized
EVGA has or we're not fully sure if the
fans are better just the solution as a
whole works a bit better but either way
it's it's marginally better they have
small victories where they might not
have victories comes in the looks the
appearance this block is probably a
little bit polarizing it's it's kind of
fat it's got LEDs which not everyone
wants and it's EVGA branded LEDs so if
you like those great you get it at the
same price as the h1 heartbeat ooh
if you don't like them you get the H 100
B 2 and it's just a plain block that I
think says Corsair on it and has really
no LEDs or anything like that so that's
what it comes down to at this point is
do you want those LEDs or not in terms
of installing them on things they are
a Sutekh gen-5 pumps they have the same
mounting kit they both fit and four they
fit thread Ripper they fit everything
you just need to have the right bracket
for it and thread Ripper comes with an
eight a Sutekh bracket you can get an T
and Intel brackets in the box so they
are both pretty much compatible with
everything and then installation wise
same process same procedure so
temperature is about the same just comes
down to how much you care about our one
ish degree difference which is pretty
close to error and how would you care
about the LEDs so that's all for this
