piece how we disabled multi-core
enhancement for a CPU benchmark to make
sure things were fair and one of the
higher uploaded comments was about why
did you do that
that's unfair it makes the CPU better
you hate the company that that makes the
CPU well the thing is that I explained
then and we're gonna do it more depth
now molten core enhancement is not a CPU
feature it's a motherboard feature and a
lot of people don't even really seem to
understand what it does when they
criticize the disablement of that
feature so we're gonna go over that
today we're going through the coffee
lake turbo boost table just because it's
kind of a good time to do that and we'll
be talking about the different features
of aces and gigabyte what they do and
when is it considered stock versus when
is it kind of just cheating at the
benchmark results before that this is
brought to you by the EVGA 240 c LC
which is a $120 MSRP closed-loop liquid
cooler the EVGA 240 c LC has an RGB
illuminated pomp plate uses a thermal
probe within the lower pump chamber for
liquid temperature monitoring and allows
customization through software learn
more at the link in the description
below so multi-core enhancement then
first of all it's called a few different
things but basically means the same
thing on every platform this is a
feature that is either auto or disabled
on ACS boards it's Auto enabled or
disabled on gigabyte boards or some
variants of that on MSI and asrock and
the feature more or less just says lock
the CPU and its maximum turbo state at
all times on all cores regardless of
whether the application is single dual
quad or six threaded and in the case of
the 8700 K to give you an example the
turbo tables for this processor just to
go through them if you're running six
core applications six cores engaged that
will output a 4.3 gigahertz speed per
the Intel spec so that's that is as
stock as stock gets now the word stock
it gets a little confusing with CPUs and
motherboards because the to directly
influence one another as far as the CPU
is concerned as defined by Intel the
specification is 4.3 gigahertz six core
4.4 gigahertz for four to five core
engagement 4.5 gigahertz for three core
4.6 for two core and 4.7 gigahertz for
single core or single threaded
engagement with the 8700 K and E has
something similar they have XFR extended
frequency range which more or less
dictates that with the more thread
limited applications you get maybe an
extra one to two hundred megahertz out
of the clock which is why with the 1950
X sometimes if you do an all core 4
gigahertz overclock performance is
actually worse than out of box because
out of box with a limited thread
utilization application you end up with
4.1 4.2 gigahertz whereas your book
gigahertz all core overclock is worse so
that's where these come in just to get
everyone up to speed the 8700 I seven
CPU four to six cores 4.33 core is 4.4
gigahertz to is 4.5 single is 4.6
gigahertz the 80 600 K 5 to 6 core turbo
is 4.1 gigahertz speed 2 to 4 quarter Bo
4.2 single core 4.3 and then down the
line the 8400 cuz we also have that one
that's five to six at 3.8 2 to 4 at 3.9
and single at 4 gigahertz the i3 CPUs
just have one speed there's no turbo so
that's the turbo table as distributed by
Intel to its motherboard vendors the
motherboard vendors can then take that
information and change it it is up to
the vendors to decide whether their
motherboards auto multi-core enhancement
defaults with auto meaning on or off and
what it does is again locks the CPU to
its maximum turbo speed regardless of
the Intel specification this isn't
breaking any rules with Intel as we
understand it it's just that's they can
do it if they want to and so then of
course from
morgen standpoint you disable that cuz
it's not a stock out of box CPU behavior
you were no longer benchmarking the 8700
K as the stock 8700 K you can't call it
in your chart for example 8700 ka stock
if it's got multi core enhancement on it
because when you start running games
that are let's say six threaded
applications or something six core
applications rather than running four
point three gigahertz like it should it
might run four point seven so at what
point does that become disingenuous at
what point does it seem like it's sort
of cheating at the results and from a
motherboard standpoint if as a vendor
you realize you can push an extra three
hundred megahertz with this multi-core
enhancement then it makes your board
look better maybe ten percent in some
cases then the competitors because they
might default to the Intel spec so that
can get confusing wanted to point that
out to explain a few things one if you
see a disparity in some results for CPU
benchmarks where for example we talks
about our board hitting four point four
and a lot of applications with the
gigabyte ultra gaming Z 370 that's
because that board follows the Intel
spec I spoke with the gigabyte about
this and they're pretty hardcore about
being in line with the Intel spec and
not playing any trickery with the
multi-core enhancement or whatever it's
called
unless the user enables it so one thing
that Asus does is a see also defaults
this option to like it's technically
Auto and if you enable XMP it will ask
it'll prompt and say do you want to
enable multi-core enhancement and if
you're not paying attention or you just
think hey that sounds pretty good and
hit yes
it'll do that 4.7 gigahertz all cores so
that can well that does influence
performance results which we'll go
through in a moment so the two
discussion pieces here are how is
performance influenced in terms of a
simple Cinebench score power consumption
and thermals and then is it better to
default to on or off from a user
perspective
and from a benchmarking perspective I'm
just gonna tell you now off is better
you benchmark stock stock to stock it
does not change there's no stock
modified division of CPU benchmarking
either you call it stock or it's
overclocked so that's kind of how I look
at it but let's get into these so
Cinebench first off gives us a pretty
quick look at this we're gonna be
focusing on the combined average results
for enhanced multi-core on versus off
with two different motherboards the
difference from all quarter bow
enhancements is immediately visible in
Cinebench disabled with the clocks
locked to the four point three gigahertz
all core Intel specification our multi
pass average sits at 14 48 CB marks
enabling multi-core enhancement options
boost that to about fifteen seventy
eight marks for an eight point nine
percent performance uplift as a result
of the four point seven gigahertz all
core turbo that gain isn't free though
there are a couple of things attached to
one for the next set of tests with
thermals and power we actually wanted to
use blender for something real world the
problem is with the Asus z3 70 board
using the auto multi-core enhancement
setting we actually were crashing in
blender so it would hit 4.7 gigahertz
all core per the ACS setting but
something was off in either voltage or
just something wasn't quite configured
properly when you let the motherboard do
its thing and that meant blender crashed
prime didn't but blender did and blender
kind of has that effect lately we
noticed that it's it's a bit more
voltage intensive or perhaps a better
word sensitive voltage sensitive than
prime prime is intensive but it's not
quite as sensitive as some of our
blender tests so that means that
enabling this straight away you're in a
situation where as a user if you enable
XMP and then say yes I would like this
multi-core enhancement thing some
applications might crash it's less
stable which is kind of why it's better
to ship with it default it to off which
both ACS and gigabyte do though as a
user it's pretty easy to to just hit yes
to all the boxes that pop up so be
careful of that I said the gain is not
free in terms of that 9ish percent
performance uplift by enabling
multi-core enhancement
less than stability the non-free aspect
is the power consumption and thermals so
we're measuring at the EPS 12-volt rails
here this is not wall power and is
representative almost exclusively of the
CPU power consumption with the complete
stock Intel specified configuration
power consumption measures at about 102
watts during Cinebench testing with the
Asus board enabling the 4.7 gigahertz
forced all core turbo pushes us to 145
watts a substantial 42% increase in
power consumption for about a 9%
increase in Cinebench score this thermal
test we're about to show uses prime95
28.5 with L FFT is to quickly burn in
the CPU blender was again crashing so we
couldn't use that as we wanted to and
another note here this is after we've
deleted an applied liquid metal to the
CPU and just to address the question yes
all the gaming and production tests were
done and the stock configuration before
deleting but now that we're into
thermals obviously were deleted at this
point this overtime plot shows the
temperature behavior as power cycles
ramp up and down enabled multi-core
enhancement was placing us at around 57
degrees Celsius or 50 degrees Celsius
with enhancement disabled meaning the
4.7 vs. 4.3 gigahertz difference was 7
degrees Celsius but it's not because of
the frequency alone this also brings in
a voltage change because clearly thermal
behavior is influenced heavily by
voltage tables assigned to each
enhancement or configuration and
ultimately it is volts times amps gives
you power so with the ACS maximus board
Otto voltage ID plots high in prime95
when using multi-core enhancement
measuring at one point for two to one
point four to six voltage ID again on
the Maximus with enhancement enabled
reverting to intel's stock out of box
spec but still with XMP puts us at one
point two six voltage ID average across
all cores as for the three hundred
megahertz lower clocks 300 to 400 anyway
it's probably about four point three
versus four point seven gigahertz and
that's where our power and thermal
difference primarily comes from
so hopefully that explains the turbo
behavior with coffee lake
bringing this up again because clearly a
9% difference in Cinebench is pretty big
you can definitely see that and for
anyone who buys the cpu and feels like
their performance doesn't match
something they've seen online I would
suggest checking that option first
the next question though is with this
option there does it make more sense to
enable it by default or to disable it by
default we're disabled might mean Auto
and what we generally see motherboard
vendors do now is default to an auto
state which is off and then if you
enable things like maybe change a
multiplier that tends to basically just
enable it overrides everything once you
start playing with multipliers if you
enable XMP on some boards it'll ask to
enable it and what motherboard vendors
want to know from you after speaking
with some of them today is do you want
this type of feature on or off by
default I have my own opinions on it I
will share them but just pause here and
leave your comment below
answering the question of enhanced
multi-core as a feature boosting your
clocks to all core turbo-bean maxed out
given the data we've just given you
should that be on or off by default by
the motherboard vendor so my opinion of
it is it should be off because this is a
feature that in blender with the Asus
board is clearly unstable we're crashing
can't even really get the render going
and yes it's faster it consumes more
power but it's also crashing so it's not
really a stable product and if it's on
by default a lot of the people who buy
these types of boards aren't going to go
digging through BIOS and finding options
and names things like Auto multi-core
enhancement because why on earth would
you disable that if it were on by
default it just it isn't something that
a non savvy user might think of and when
i say non savvy i mean this is still
someone who probably built their own
system but it's it's really easy to lose
sight of just how many people go into
BIOS and it's not that many you get
people who maybe enable XMP and that's
about the extent
and that's perfectly fine and perfectly
normal and I was there too but because
that audience is so big I would say you
appeal to the stability of the Intel
specification and run it stock the next
point to make from a review standpoint
although motherboard vendors don't make
motherboards for reviewers specifically
from a review standpoint you really want
to test the CPU as it's made by Intel or
AMD you don't want to test the CPU as it
performs with the motherboard that's a
motherboard review not a CPU review so
it starts really screwing with result
and makes it hard to compare numbers
between your own tests if you change
motherboards or
vs. other reviewers and that leads to
confusion in the market either with
readers with reviewers just in general
confusion so my vote goes to off but
they were curious about your thoughts
and so leave them below that said
ultimately just a really quick thing you
know it's it's 90% better performance
with it on and Cinebench for like 40%
more power and some instability so just
if you're wondering how turbo works with
Intel now that was the answer in the
very beginning where six cores different
from four to five different from three
two and one
they all different speeds Andy is doing
kind of the same thing but less extreme
they're just doing XFR and turbo which
makes it a bit easier to understand
Intel's doing it all the way down from I
mean just every single core account
basically has a different turbo and that
means they can min max their performance
more it also means it's a little bit
more confusing so hopefully everyone can
keep that in mind when you look at your
CPUs performance and you're like why is
this running at lower than spec speed
it's because the spec is probably
different based on what application
you're using so that's all for this one
