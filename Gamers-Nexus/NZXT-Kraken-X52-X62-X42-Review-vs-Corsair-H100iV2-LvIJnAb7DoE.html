in 142 forty and 280 millimeter sizes
and primarily differentiate themselves
from the market with aesthetics the
coolers are accompanied by infinity
mirrors and an RGB LED light pipe built
on an ASA Tech m5 pump with heavy
customization by NZXT this includes a
custom-built PCB internally and
theoretical improvements to pump noise
today we're looking at MDX C's X 42 X 52
and X 62 liquid coolers versus
competitors we're testing in depth the
thermals and the noise but before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by AMD freesync devices like the
LG 34 um 67 - p ultra wide with free
sync which is actually affordable at
$400 link in the description below for
more on that the X 42 is priced at $130
the X 52 which is probably going to be
the most popular unit at 240 millimeter
radiator is priced at 150 dollars in the
X 62 is $10 more at 160 so the price
point is high but it's really just their
way of saying this is a new product and
it's got the RGB LED pump plate and a
Gen 5 cooler the most comparable
competition would be the H 100 I v2 from
Corsair it's also a Gen 5 pump from ASA
Tech as well but it's less refined in
terms of the electrical and NZXT you
have this whole PCB custom designed and
built and they also have control over
the firmware so they can issue firmware
updates to their new coolers in the x2
line so 60 - 40 - 50 - so that's some
level of the validation for the price
point I suppose we'll look at thermals
and noise and see if that's any further
reason to pay as much the H 100 I v2 is
one hundred five dollars so it is pretty
competitive it's been out for a little
while at this point and the difference
between the X 52 which is 240 and the H
100 IV - which is also 240 really stems
from the custom electrical design which
ace tech hasn't previously allowed and
the LEDs and then NZXT also uses
different fans but we'll look at
Corsairs and the z-axis
whose is better starting off with the
specs the 120-millimeter fans spin up to
about 2,000 rpm with NZXT Corsairs spin
up to 2500 rpm the 140 millimeter crack
and cooler fans are specified for 1700
rpm max more or less and the pump speeds
at around 2600 to 2800 rpm with the
variance of plus or minus 300 rpm unit 2
unit this a Sutekh gen 5 pump is
controllable through cam software NZXT
is a solution and if you'd like to
reduce pump speed and fan speed
independently up from one another for
better control over noise output you
could do that internally the unit is
pretty familiar to most ASA tech cooling
solutions there's an in and out valve
connected to Barb's that have double
elbow bends for poseable tubing rather
than the tubing that juts out at the top
of the corsair unit for example and the
tubes are made of the same permeation
resistant rubber found in the previous
crack and coolers it's got a braid now
so I guess that's somewhat similar to
EVGA is Jenn and four point-five coolers
internal design uses the usual copper
cold plate with micro fins to increase
surface area through which propylene
glycol flows to bring the heat up to an
aluminum core radiator and the only
radiator on our bench that we're about
to show without an aluminum core is the
ek predator 280 it's still pretty
uncommon and I use a copper core which
we think might benefit EK and the
predator at the low end of fan RPMs cam
allows the usual mix of breathing wave
spectrum and custom led colors split
between the logo and the white pipe and
the cooler connects to the motherboard
via USB 2.0 cable so owners of mini ITX
motherboard may have to buy a 3.0 to 2.0
adapter and then connects to power via
SATA so these cables are modular unlike
the previous kraken and that's a nice
touch for cable cleanliness cooler
installation is the same as any other
ace tech pump of the last two
generations x99 uses a set of four
standoffs and then some cap nuts which
takes less than five minutes to install
outside of a case and 11 5 X or AMD
sockets use a backplate in addition to
the other mounting hardware so not too
bad overall just make sure you do the
installation prior to mounting the board
in case time to test this stuff all the
testing methodology as always is defined
in the article review of these coolers
in the link in the description below
that includes the overclock the
components use CPU fan RPMs pump RPMs
all of that stuff software used
and will probably answer any questions
you have cooler test benches do take a
good deal of validation to deploy
properly we've tested these multiple
times and have a pretty good idea of our
range of uncertainty between devices in
terms of temperatures and noise also in
the description in that link if you're
curious and our noise testing parameters
are defined there including other
components used during thermal
validation versus noise validation
because we do use different components
some of which have passive cooling let's
start with strictly head-to-head
comparisons versus last generation this
chart shows only the x61 a popular
cooler from last gen to 80 millimetres
versus the X 62 from this current
generation the thermal difference alone
rpm to rpm is actually somewhat
substantial NZXT has managed to reduce
temperatures at a somewhat silent RPM of
1050 by roughly 5 degrees C from 42 to
37 C load the high end performance isn't
as gapped with the X 62 at 1700 rpm
operating at 34.6 Celsius load while X
61 is at 36.9 assal seus load note that
the X 61 can run its fans at 2,000 rpm
have really desired where the X 62 caps
at 1700 so this is a change with the new
generation and here's a look at the
noise results on a scatter plot for
something a bit different the X 61 at
10:50 rpm is approximately equal in
noise output to the X 62 at 10:50 rpm
also with the newer cooler performing
imperceptibly louder but with a 5
Celsius temperature reduction in
exchange for that 0.3 DB noise increase
so it's well worth the trade and can
most likely be attributed to the Gen 5s
tech pump and the new fans that NZXT is
using probably more so the fans at 1,700
rpm noise levels for the X 61 are around
50 1.4 dB where the X 62 is one-tenth
the decibel high or 50 1.5 with the 2
Celsius reduction in temperature not
quite as good as the previous test but
we're at the high end of performance
here anyway that's a good start for the
new coolers but we need to compare them
outside of a vacuum this chart looks at
a few more devices we've introduced the
coarser H 100 IV to the direct
competitor at three different RPMs 2500
the max 1500 a middle ground we're using
for pretty much
everything we're testing and 1050 RPM
for more of a silent setting we've also
introduced the NZXT crack and x52 which
is again that direct competition to
coursers h100 ib2 it's the same sized
radiator and that's at 2100 RPM its own
max and 1500 RPM for the middle ground
with two low rpm outputs of 800 and 400
and we've removed the X 61 from this
chart for ease of viewing NZXT in
Corsair used the same generation pump
but NZXT is is heavily customized
including that PCB customization I
talked about and NZXT can patch the
firmware in the future and Corsairs pump
is basically a stock a stack unit with
some Corsair badging and SP 120 fans
that coursers designed in the house the
X 62 naturally sits atop the charts it's
bigger surface area radiator and larger
fans aided in this regard but Corsairs H
100 IB 2 sits just ahead of the crack
and X 52 the direct competitor which
also costs a bit more about $35 when
comparing at max RPMs we'll get to noise
in a moment but the difference between
the devices at their max rpm is
approximately 1 Celsius so not
noticeable really and very no impact on
CPU performance in the real world
rpm for rpm both devices at 1500 we see
that the X 52 is superior to the H 100
Ivy 2 by approximately 1 C again so not
really significant but definitely
measurable as for the X 52 with its
lowest quietest fan speed settings 400
rpm is completely pointless don't set
your fans that's low if we stop using
Delta values for a moment and add
ambient back in it reveals that the CPU
temperature is nearly 95 C with 400 rpm
they're really not moving air at all
why NZXT allows a PWM signal to detect
and output a fan speed that dangerously
low is beyond me it should be capped
closer to 800 rpm even there though
we're getting a 75 to 77 C output or 55
dots 6.2 T and the noise levels are at
32 DB so that does make them unbeaten
with our current lineup that we've
listed but again you're at a higher
temperature so adding in DB for the rest
of the devices to see which is truly
superior the DB accounted for we now see
the coarser h100 IB 2 at 1500 rpm is
operating at the decibel level of 41.8
where the NZXT crack and X 52 is at 1500
rpm and runs
forty-two DB so there's difference of
0.2 again not really significant or
observable to the human ear but if all
that matters to you is cooling a noise
and the LEDs and aesthetics are
valueless then the H 100 IB 2 is clearly
a much cheaper option for those two
metrics and performs about the same but
there's a better mix still if we ignore
price temporarily we're seeing the X 62
at 10:50 rpm operating with a lower
temperature than any of these devices
excluding only the H 100 IB 2 at 2500
rpm or a borderline intolerable noise
output of 53 9 DB the X 62 at 10:50 RPM
outputs 37.4 DB with a load temperature
of 37 C versus the H 100 IB 2 and X 52
devices both at around 42 DB and 40 C
for their 1500 rpm performance time to
add more devices to the charge though
we're staggering them to keep it a bit
legible here's a look at performance
with the next competitor added the ek
predator to 80 X LC know that this 210
dollar cooler is meant for creating semi
custom open-loop / closed-loop liquid
cooling it's a bit unique in that regard
uses quick release valves to couple with
prefilled water blocks for GPU cooling
in this scenario we're only testing the
predator CPU cooling ability and have
not hooked up a GPU to the loop ek is
using a copper radiator that's fatter
than its competition alongside two
custom 140 millimeter fans the predator
maxes out at 1,400 rpm but has a much
lower bottom line of 600 rpm while still
remaining under operable temperatures
the predator also as the third best
performance temperatures on the bench
only marginally behind the ex 62 from
NZXT though not exactly linearly
comparable given a significantly higher
price and more customizable loop
formation still at 35.9 to see the
predator 280 is off to a good start the
predator 280 is still able to
impressively operate at 49.3 celsius
with a 600 rpm fan speed which if we
move now to the noise chart outputs 29.2
DB the predator at 600 rpm is the
quietest on the bench while still
remaining capable of cooling the CPU
reasonably its 1,400 rpm performance
lands at at 41.4 DB or about the same
volume as the Corsair h 100 IB 2 at 1500
p.m. but with five celcius cooler
performance on the ek predator it's also
about 0.4 DB louder than the X 62 again
really not that noticeable at ten fifty
rpm which is effectively equal in
cooling performance overall and finally
let's add all the devices to the charts
this new thermal chart adds the be quiet
dark rock 3 at 2,000 rpm for a look at a
50-dollar air coolers performance but it
also adds the X 42 140 millimeter Kraken
series cooler the X 42 is able to keep
up with the 240 millimeter coolers only
when Maxine its rpm which lands the 140
millimeter device at 40.6 see the X 52
is about 1c cooler with a 200 rpm
reduction of fan speed and also runs to
fans obviously and a larger radiator
which helps the X 42 at 10:50 RPM
operates at 46 to see really damn close
to the H 100 IV 2 at 10:50 rpm that's
the bonus of a larger radiator and fan
though the price is unfortunately still
higher than Corsair is cooler if the X
42 are priced below or around $100 it'd
make a whole lot more sense as a product
based on these results versus the
Corsair offering the thin is 9 C cooler
though than the dark rock 3 air cooler
if you wanted to have more of a baseline
reference to sort of traditional options
and that cost $50 these days this noise
chart has undergone some kollene we're
looking at the nearest competitors so
the H 100 IV to the Kraken coolers and
just a few of the most relevant RPMs
listed for each alongside the dark rock
3 the be quiet cooler sits at 55 Celsius
load with a 37.7 DB at 2,000 rpm while
the Kraken x42 at even just 1050 RPM
sustains 835 DB and 46.2 C output still
the X 42 is readily beaten in noise and
temperature by the H 100 IB 2 and other
crack and products so that was a huge
amount of data hopefully it made sense
when laid out like that just sort of
sequentially once the next overall what
we're seeing is that the value
proposition favors something like an H
100 IV 2 over the X 42 right now that's
purely on a price to performance level
on the other hand
the X 62 the largest unit that we tested
here other than the predator is looking
like the best offering in terms of a mix
of noise to performance because we can
run it at 10 50 rpm and still have some
pretty low thermals along with obviously
the reduced noise of running a more
limited fan rpm and of course at 1,700
rpm it's unbeaten on the bench even by
the predator 280 xlc which is a really
well designed and built radiator with a
copper core and cold plate but it's just
outperformed by the X 62 at the higher
rpms now the X 62 is $160 so 55 more
than the H 100 IV to with most of that
cost going to the RGB LEDs and the pump
block you basically have to ask yourself
if you want to spend about 50 dollars
more on LEDs because that's the most
dividing factor between the H 100 IB 2
and the X v 2 or X 62 m x 52 performs
that a good-enough mixture of noise to
performance especially at 1500 rpm that
it's neck-and-neck with coursers h 100
IV to the X 62 meanwhile has performance
favored over Corsairs H 100 IV 2 but the
X 52 is effectively tied other than
aesthetics and other small value adds
that's really what you're building your
purchasing decision on if looking at a
240 rad is do I want the aesthetics and
the modular cables in step with a higher
price the new kraken series is a
much-needed refresh to the slow product
cycle that NZXT seems to have been stuck
in for about a year now cooling
performance is better than the last
generation noises about the same and the
RGB LED lighting effects are presently
unmatched in the liquid cooling market
just no one quite does it like NZXT does
right now
the cooling performance isn't good
enough to justify a purchase on its own
given the price range again of 130 to
160 dollars but it is if you want the
LEDs if not there's really no point to
buy the crack in coolers over something
like the H 100 IV - and it all really
does come down to price with these if
NZXT ends up dropping their prices by
maybe 10 max 15 dollars per unit they'd
be pretty easy to recommend over course
there's H 100 IV - even if the LEDs
aren't the top of your priorities but
they're still kind of cool to have
now if LEDs are the top of your priority
is
all your choices obviously made for you
these are the only things that do the
LEDs on the pump plate quite like this
really well done effects cam interacts
and as far as lighting pretty well with
the pump and with the lighting effects
that go on so easy to use and setup in
that regard if cooling and noise are the
top of your list then you're basically
left looking at age 100 IV to over
something like the X 42 or the X 52 over
the X 42 because this is an odd man out
product it's maybe okay if you have a
really restrictive scenario where you
have to fit a radiator that size in your
case but it is the outlier because it's
at a price point where it feels like
just $20 more you do end up with the X
52 and that is significantly better
especially with regard to noise you can
keep your fan rpm as a bit lower output
slightly lower noise and your
temperatures will be minimally the same
but most the time better depending on
what you're doing with your fans so this
one does make the least sense of the
three the X 62 it seems the best in
terms of a mixture of noise and cooling
performance at 10:50 rpm you get a noise
level that's really pretty much unheard
considering other components in the
system and that's hard to get while also
maintaining good cooling performance
which the X 62 does and does well so
that's the one that is the most
impressive to us anyway and it is just
$160 so you have to look at do I want
the LEDs and the performance if you
don't and if a lower price is important
the H 100 IB 2 is a pretty good product
still maybe slightly older but it's
still a Gen 5 pump it's just the RGB
LEDs and therefore is cheaper so that's
what you have to work with we've given
you all the objective data at this point
it's a subjective thing do you want LEDs
or not the NZXT products I do think are
better designed but they come with the
cost obviously an ek is predator by the
way 280 exile C is a really cool device
I want to look at that moral probably
review it shortly properly with a GP
waterblock but it's really not something
that's meant to be used standalone it's
got the quick release for a reason so
that is all as always patreon like the
