up to the cpu's inevitable launch at
this point it's not too far away so for
today we'll be recapping some of the
news on the rise in stock CPU coolers
which we've sort of independently
validated looking at the ACS X 370
boards and then some rise and die shots
for a deeper dive of some of the
architecture before getting to the
proper review which will eventually be
posted where we'll have more of the
details fully explained but for now we
can look at what is out there and what
has finally been to some extent
confirmed because it's all done rumors
and leaks up until now before getting to
that this coverage is brought to you by
raw fury publishers of Kingdom a
side-scrolling city builder that we
previously reviewed and the new
tormentor X Punisher he'll an up game
where everyone has one HP click the link
below for more information on those in a
previous content peace we talked about
how some motherboards at CES have the
text s3 radiator support printed on them
at the AMD CES suite and of course no
one from AMD would talk about that text
but we've already shown that we talked
about what that probably means which is
going to be likely a stock cooler for
one of the AMD rising SKUs it would
probably be a higher-end one or an
overclocking targeted SKU so S 3.0
radiator support we already know that's
going to be a thing and it will probably
be in the line of these stock coolers
for Rison what we haven't talked about
in the past is that there is probably
also going to be an s-1 and an s2 I've
heard two types of names on these I've
heard s1 2 and 3 and I've heard SR 1 2 &amp;amp;
3 we're just gonna go with s4 now and
drop the are the s-1 stock cooler from
what we've been able to gather is
supposed to be a 65 watt TDP CPU
targeted cooler so that would be the
lower end of the coolers I don't have
any images for any of these right now
that will fly out the wait until launch
but s2 is supposed to support 95 watt
TDP CPUs and is also equipped with some
form of RGB lighting whether that is
through an MCU or not I'm not clear on
right now but some form of RGB lighting
probably not too different from the
Wraith cooler although that was just a
white LED
I would think it would be something
similar to that just with the RGB since
that's basically a requirement at this
point the s3 cooler which we know thanks
for that motherboard I think was a
Biostar board or max on one of them but
thanks that board we know it is probably
a radiator so liquid cooler and a IO
which actually conveniently this also
ships with a IO is back in the day so
it's not the first time
AMD would be doing that s3 is supposed
to be rated for 125 watt TDP and it's
also going to include some form of LEDs
hooked up through an MCU from what we've
been able to gather and that MTU
would be theoretically controllable
somehow now what we also know is that
some of the board vendors from what it
sounds like will have their own
applications that will allow
modification of the s2 coolers or sr2
coolers and their RGB LEDs not 100% sure
exactly how that's going to work just
yet but that's kind of what what we know
based on some information gathering as a
side note from what we understand the
package height of the horizon CPUs will
be a bit taller than the FX series CPUs
and that would explain why at least in
part there are new mounting kits despite
looking kind of the same if you just
were to eyeball the board the packet
right as we understand it should be
higher though so that would of course
missus pay a different mounting kit
moving on to motherboards we've already
detailed gigabyte MSI Biostar and a
couple of other motherboards for the amp
or sockets but now we've got some news
on Asus that they actually posted
themselves the immediate horizon line up
for ACS will be championed by the
crosshair six hero and the prime series
X 370 board both of these are actually
70 chipsets the prime one lands about
where Strix lands on the marketing stack
as though it looks like Strix has
potentially been replaced in the AMD
series board with the word prime
starting with the prime X 370
motherboard we see that ACS is running
the three full-length PCIe slots with
two of them at dawn in the ubiquitous
armors that we've seen taking every
marketing box lately the top PCIe slot
on the prime xc70 is wired for x16 with
the lower two wired four by eight
configurations looking over the board
closely we can spot the multi
GPU marks chips just above CMOS and
that's something we've seen on most and
the amp or motherboards thus far
including MSI's boards at CES 2017 and
we've already created an Andy rising
block diagram from previous content that
explains the lane assignment but we'll
bring that back on the screen now you
can check our an for chipset differences
video and article for a full breakdown
on the a B and x-303 chipsets and the X
370 looking to the far right of the
prime xc70 board there are eight total
SATA 3 slots rated at the usual six
gigabits per second with one m dot 2
location above the top PCIe x16 slot it
appears that this M 2 slot can run by 4
PCIe or SATA both of which are supported
by the chipset near the CPU socket are
the large inductors from the vrm and
those appeared to be accompanied that by
an actual heatsink for once it has fins
rather than a just a big block of
aluminum that doesn't actually really
cool all that efficiently there's also
an RGB header adjacent to the chassis
and a IO pump headers all near the CPU
sockets
we're expecting the prime xb-70 to land
between 150 and 180 for price point in
the u.s. anyway the other model the
crosshair 6 hosts the same PCIe
configuration that there was different
marks positioning on the board and it
also has the same SATA 3 slot
configuration the m2 port has also been
relocated just south of the chipset out
of the way of the GPUs with the RGB
header located just below the m2 slot
near the water pump and USB 3 headers
last of these we see ln2 mode pins and
then a set of troubleshooting and boot
buttons that are always nice to have and
generally on these higher-end my boards
we're expecting between 200 and 300
dollars for the crosshair board iOS are
also officially announced their
motherboard lineup the other day but we
already detailed basically all of their
major board offerings in our previous
content from CES so they're curious
about that you can check that content
we'll link one of them and the cards or
something like that for the video in the
other Rison news for today there are
some new die shots of the horizon
architecture and these were posted by
a Japanese site PC watch have been
reposted
a million times at this point but
basically there are shots with dye we
can see individual cores one of the
individual cores and then a CC X
complete diagram the dye shot mostly
details things we already knew like the
presence of a single floating-point unit
and single energy unit per core rather
than boulders there's old design of one
FPU ship between two integer units the I
shot also shows the layout of the core
complex modules which will contain four
cores each with their own l2 cache and
flexible l3 cache split between them
this is a particularly new information
but the images are so we can actually
see what the same looks like now and
that's of course important to really
just getting a better idea of how its
laid out and Andy plans to use this CPU
design going forward so get familiar
with it because there's a good chance
you'll be seeing this for future
generations following Rison and in terms
of process Andy has finally mostly at
parity with Intel at this point they're
both 14 nanometer process Intel's it's
technically denser packed than Andy's
version but they each have their own
characteristics and will obviously not
really be able to validate anything or
how performances until we've got it in
the hand so stay tuned for the Rison
