problem with extreme overclocking and
liquid nitrogen benchmarking and that is
it's all done with synthetic benchmarks
like x bi which are great for
competitive scoring and seeing how the
cards plays but what we're doing today
is gaming benchmarks so we were writing
the kingpin 2080 ti through our actual
benchmark suite for GPUs including real
games like Sniper Elite for F 1 2018 far
cry 5 shadow of the Tomb Raider and
we're doing it while it's under liquid
nitrogen so we're going to be mounting
an L n to pot to the card going through
the benchmarks trying to maintain the
pot temperature and see how much does it
scale in reality when you're at 25 65
megahertz before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds Thermal
Grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound
learn more at the link in the
description below the most common
complaint we've gotten in the liquid
nitrogen overclocking streams is that
apparently people think it's not
practical or something so we're gonna
show you how easy it really is all you
need is a three to four hundred dollar
liquid nitrogen pot ideally you also get
a $1,900 video card that is pre-prepared
for liquid nitrogen although you could
do some hard mod yourself you'll need a
giant tub of Vaseline a brush some good
paste for - 130 or below degree Celsius
temperature so we're using kpx for that
need a heat gun and that some liquid
nitrogen so this is actually something
everyone can do at home please actually
look into what you're doing if you if
you try to follow that advice so yeah
it's it's obviously impractical but what
we're gonna do is set it up and do some
gaming with L on to anyway and all we
need to do for this is clean off the
card get vaseline all over the memory on
the vrm there's already some applied
will heat it up and doing all of this
will prep us for running the card at
around minus 130 degrees Celsius
this one likes to run we're going to be
using settings of about 25 65 megahertz
or thereabouts for the core and we'll
have a setting of about 1500 megahertz
offset for the memory then voltage will
be in the range of about one point three
to five to one point four four V core
and we'll be running about one point
five for the memory voltage and NV VDD
OCP will be turned off and that should
be about all we need so then finally to
answer the comment of liquid nitrogen
overclocking is is pointless because you
can't play games we will now raise you
with actually yes you can and all we
have to do is have two people one to
manage the pot temperature and one to
play the game and that will be
everything required for the ln2
gaming benchmarks and then we'll get
into the numbers so what we'll be doing
is we're going to set Patrick up to play
a game I will be managing the liquid
nitrogen temperature and pouring more
ln2 between the two of us we should be
able to actually game while on lnto so
we'll have some numbers in the actual
charts in benchmarks the exact same way
as every other GP that we have on the
charts and they'll get you get you all
the information so we can see the actual
scaling while we're doing gaming
benchmarks on something that's at say
500 megahertz higher than the actual
stock cards are really meant to run
that'll show us once and for all what
kind of scaling there is if any in real
gaming workloads and not just in
synthetic workloads Sniper Elite 4
starts us out this game uses DirectX 12
and the best implementation we've seen
to date for a game and has known scaling
to avoid CPU bottlenecks on our platform
we also use asynchronous compute which
is well leveraged on modern
architectures the kingpin 20 atti at
twenty five sixty five megahertz core
and plus fifteen hundred memory putting
it about five hundred megahertz more
than most overclocked twenty eighty TI's
ends up at 148 FPS average with
extremely well times low performance in
fact the Ellen 2 K P card outperforms
the water
old KP overclocks 131 FPS average by an
impressive 13.5 percent moreover it
significantly outperforms the borderline
instability experienced in our
water-cooled overclock compared to the
stock kingpin card at 120 FPS average
the improvement with ln2 is 24% with the
frequency increase about 26% over the 20
40 megahertz baseline this is a fairly
linear scaling and shows impressive
gains although a large part of that is
attributable to the well-built nature of
Sniper Elite 4 interestingly the NV link
20 atti cards end up at about 210 FPS
average posting nearly perfect scaling
but the KP 20 atti splits the difference
when under l on - between the NV link
and the stock single card results not
bad here's where it gets interesting
this frame time plot shows the kingpin
20 atti stock card performance plotted
in blue with the ln 228 ET ikp card
reaching frame times closer to 6
milliseconds
that's impressive remember lower is
better here and the consistency is even
more impressive we don't encounter any
excursions from the mean equal to or
greater than 8 milliseconds so the user
gets functionally a perfect fluid
experience at around 150 FPS average
with good frame times for reference
sixteen point six six seven milliseconds
would be 60 FPS average which we are
well below but the KP 20 80 TI with
water cooling and a borderline unstable
overclock encountered more excursions
that manifest as small stutters in
gameplay clearly gaming on Allen 2 is
both very practical and objectively
superior and everyone should immediately
by Allen - Potts doers and switch to
Allen - gaming rigs with co-drivers for
pouring f1 2018 is next giving us a
DirectX 11 title to look at for this one
the only setup that beats our ln 2 KP
card is the dual card Titan RT x
configuration with NV link running a 175
FPS average with frankly abysmal frame
time consistency the KP 20 atti at 25 65
megahertz and + 1500 megahertz memory
runs at 138 FPS average meaning the dual
Titan RT axes lead only by 26% despite
having a financial requirement nearing 3
times higher versus the water-cooled KP
overclocked at 122 FPS average our
increase is an impressed
14% was a 0.1% low frame time
performance doubled compared to the
stock 20 ATT I can been at 113 FPS
average the increase is 23% and it's
about 31% faster than the 28 ECI XC
Ultra is 106 FPS average shadow the tomb
Raider's next swinging us back to
DirectX 12 for this one the ln2 cooled
kingpin 20 atti 2565 megahertz core and
again a boosted memory gets us to 92 FPS
average for an improvement over the
previous overclocks 82 FPS average by
13% this is a consistent uplift it seems
although the lows are much improved over
the previous overclock clearly we have
once again proven that liquid-nitrogen
gaming is in fact the only way to
achieve high refresh gaming and we hope
that all esports arenas immediately
change the cooling systems to ensure no
dropped frames to the credit of the NV
linked cards here the scallion is sort
of insane with the Titan RT X at 138 FPS
average and the xx atti at about 147 FPS
average when running on its higher
clocks and better coolers then we had to
tighten our tea ax running even with
Ellen to the KP 2080 TI has a long
distance to go to be a chart-topper but
it's certainly chart tops for single
card configurations GTA 5 is still one
of the most popular games on Steam and
so we thought the GTA v community would
be happy to know the completely
realistic and attainable frame rates
with liquid nitrogen gaming for this
game tested at 4k with to tap msaa
and very high to ultra settings we
measured the Ellen - Kane Ben 20 atti at
97 FPS average with it well timed at low
frame time performance the uplift over
the water-cooled xx atti kingpin
overclocked is about 11.5 percent moving
from 87 to 97 FPS average compared to
the stock 20 atti kingpin card and it's
20 40 megahertz average clock which is
already on the level of an average over
clocks 20 atti
we end up improves by about 21 percent
versus the 80 FPS average baseline far
cry 5 is last for this one tested again
at 4k the 20 ATT I can pin under liquid
nitrogen ends up at 103 FPS average
approaching the NV linked 20 ATT is
although NV length doesn't scale as
cleanly here as in a title like Sniper
Elite for the 103 FPS average puts us
improved over the h2o over clocks 92 FPS
average
by 12% sticking close to the improvement
we saw previously versus the stock
kingpin card we've boosted by 23% with
Ellen - Ellen - Gaming was a lot of fun
it actually the results were
surprisingly good - thirteen percent on
average improvement on - versus h2o
overclocks
and then we saw an increase of about 23
to 25 percent over the baseline stock
numbers for the already high stock
locked kingpin card so overall
successful and the actually important
thing here was just to see how does the
scaling apply to the real world and if
frequencies keep going up in a
hypothetical scenario we can now look at
how Torian would scale and potentially
future architectures but realistically
it's just kind of fun and this is not
something you should be doing at home
but if you wanted to get into liquid
nitrogen overclocking for competitive
reasons then there's plenty of resources
on how to do it you only a doer you'll
need Ellen - you absolutely need to read
up on safety it is fairly safe to do but
there are definitely things that I mean
you could die if you do it wrong like it
is a real actual hazard you could die so
just make sure you read about what
you're doing so you don't do anything
stupid but yeah a lot of fun to see the
results Sniper Elite had some very good
scaling and that is a common trend for
that particular title when we were
playing when Patrick was messing around
in GTA 5 we were we actually had to
increase the graphics settings because
we were running into the issue where we
hit the GTA 5 frame rate cap of 180 7.5
FPS at which point it will stutter back
really hard on specific CPUs it's way to
increase the graphics settings for that
reason and then frost build-up is was
not too difficult to manage you just
have to keep it cold and don't let it
warm up which means finding a stable
overclock quickly and leaving it there
and for the overclock settings we ended
up at about 1.3 1.3 to 5 for NV VDD and
then 1.5 fpv GD and we left packs alone
actually we did leave that one stock
elites at one point of 87 for the rest
OCP was off and any other setting oh
yeah we tried overclocking Patrick's
Mouse while he was using it - right
i did´t i don't know that he didn't
exactly ask for it but we did overclock
the mouse with on to so yeah that's a
that's gonna be it let us know what you
think we are considering doing a live
stream of this once we get back from
Computex so if that's something you'd
like to see let us know subscribe you go
to store like Aaron's Nexus dotnet to
help us out directly by buying a shirt
like this one this is the GPU
artifacting shirt which is particularly
relevant if you're doing liquid nitrogen
overclocking and you go to
patreon.com/scishow Nexus tell us out
there as well but the most important
thing is check back for our computation
coverage we will be in Taiwan for a
couple of weeks doing coverage in of the
show and of areas around the show thanks
for watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
