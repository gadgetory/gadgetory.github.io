hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the RT x 28 e
TI Strix PCB from asus and as you can
clearly see this is not an nvidia
reference PCB or a founders edition PCB
as they like to call it now it's it's a
bloody reference card you can stop
pretending it isn't it still doesn't
have more phases than any of the custom
models but yeah so this this is the
first of the custom PCBs and I rather
like it it has some pretty MIT like this
this actually has straight upgrades on
like every front compared to the
founders edition before that this video
is brought to you by Power colors red
dragon Vega 56 which is now below MSRP
on new I got $380 with a rebate from the
28th to the 30th of September when we
first tested Vega 56 we found the card
competitive and fun for tweaking and
modding and now that it's back in stock
it's worth a consideration
Vega 56 also comes with three free games
including Assassin's Creed Odyssey star
control and a strange brigade while
supplies last
learn more at the link below I'm gonna
say that you're probably actually you're
never gonna notice these improvements on
this PCB over the founders edition
unless you're maybe doing lnto
overclocking there you might notice or
maybe even maybe even with dry ice you
might notice a difference but unlike air
cooling water cooling and you know
without any physical modifications of
the card you're not gonna see a
difference between this PCB and the
founders edition that's not to say that
this isn't a better PCB this definitely
is better so let's get right into why
this is better so first of all same as
the founders edition asus is using the
vcore vrm sort of on either side of the
GPU core so you have one block of ecore
vrm phases over here and you have the
other block of phases over there so
that's your recore and as usual the
memory vrm is located right above that
so that's the MM up there over here in
the top we have five volts and 1.8 volts
so
1.8 volts is for things like the bios
like the BIOS chips that nvidia uses and
i just realize that the circle goes into
the vcore there but there's a fight so
you have a one regulator for 5 volts and
1.8 volts right here and this is for
basically things like the BIOS chips
that nvidia uses this is for actually
powering the RM itself because the vrm
run like these power stages they don't
run off of 12 volts or 3.3 volts they
actually need to run off of 5 volts so
that's why there's a 5 volt regulator up
there down here we have the PEX rail so
that power is the PCIe interface as well
as some internal PLL's of the the GPU
core and over here we have in a rather
odd location we have the the USBC power
so that's for the USB type-c port on the
card right here on the rear i/o so
that's what power is that and yeah that
pretty much covers the the major V RMS
scattered around actually all of the
theorems scattered around the card you
of course still have the power balancing
circuitry same as the founder citation
so you have 12 volt balancing over here
and that's still controlled by the same
chips all as on the founders Edition so
the controller for this is again AUP 7 6
v 1 q and that's a two-channel 12 volt
power management IC basically it just
switches where some of these phases
again I'm not sure without the card in
hand I don't like if I had the card in
hand I could actually check how that is
wired but without the card in hand
I just know some of the phases in this
block of in this part of the V curve erm
are gonna be able to basically switch if
they pull their power from this
connector or this connector and maybe
between the PCIe saw as well I'm not
entirely sure
again like without the card in hand I
can't see the internal power planes and
how they're interconnected I I wish I
had that kind of power that would
actually be really also
but I don't so yeah unfortunately I
don't know how that is specifically
wired up and the same goes for the
12-volt balance right here so I'm just
gonna put about ei L for short there so
yeah that's the balancing circuitry so
same as the founders Edition and other
interesting things is asus has a bios
switch up here which basically puts you
between a quiet mode and a performance
mode so that is an actual bios which
because that's really the only way to
implement any kind of like multiple like
profile system on a GPU is you need
multiple BIOS chips because you can't on
the fly change a lot well yes you could
maybe change the fan profile with a
switch but you couldn't really do
anything like change clocks or power
targets with a switch on the card that
didn't actually just straight-up change
which BIOS chip you are on so you do
have dual BIOS on this card just because
aces ones in that feature which is
pretty neat dual BIOS is nice if you're
into like tinkering with flashing
different cards biases onto your card
which can be useful if you're trying to
find like if you've come across a BIOS
for a twenty atti that has a much higher
power limit than what your cards and
normal BIOS would normally allow this is
gonna be useful for like trying that out
without running the risk of completely
breaking your card so now that's a nice
feature to have and then another feature
that ace has put on this card and I am
very surprised that an Nvidia still lets
them do this are these voltage mod
points right here I'm a huge fan of
these things but as you can clearly see
Nvidia didn't actually let them label
these properly but I hope that Asus
because well I'm hoping that Asus will
put down some ln2
you know scores with a twenty atti
and when they do that they'll hopefully
release to the public
released to the public how like how
these are specifically wired up and I'm
gonna assume that like in typical Asus
fashion the only way to get these points
to actually be enabled is to short these
pads right here
and they've been doing this on their
cards for years like all the way back to
at least the 500 series of nvidia gpus
they've been doing this you can also
find it on their AMD GPUs and it's in my
opinion a really really cool feature I'm
really surprised that video still lets
them do this but at least you know
apparently they're not letting them
label these anymore because normally
they'd be labeled something like V core
v mem V PLL and it they would give you
voltage controls for like the pecs rail
the V Corps and the memory rail but yeah
that would that would be far too that
would give you far too many control
options for your you know $1200 GPU that
you just bought from a store
so yeah the the the can't actually tell
you how those work so that's a pretty
cool feature then they have some LED
on-off stuff which I don't really care
about and yeah asus is still only on
just two eight pins which I'm kinda sad
about which but on the other hand for
like your daily usage like air cooling
water cooling it really won't make a
difference the cards not going to pull
enough power to really well unless you
do like physical modifications the cards
not going to be able to pull enough
power to overload to eight pins so for
normal users I completely understand why
they didn't bother with putting like a
third eight pin or something cuz really
$4.99 like for everybody who buys this
card that would be completely bloody
irrelevant it wouldn't actually do
anything so yeah that kind of covers the
minor intrigue interesting feature stuff
around the card let's take a closer look
at the actual V RMS so for recore asus
is going from the thirteen phase that
you find on the founders addition to a
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
fifteen sixteen phase so three phases
more than the founders addition but
other than that they've made
other changes for example asus has added
a whole bunch of extra bulk capacitance
which I assume ends like that so you
basically get a bunch of extra bulk
capacitors for the vcore and you
actually still have the like if you the
these capacitors on the back so these I
assume these are going to be aluminum
polymers a lot of people would say like
a lot of people that called like think
these are tantalum polymer capacitors
but that's most of the time like well
they can be but a lot of like this this
would be a this is a probably a tantalum
polymer but these are almost certainly
aluminum polymers and the reason why
those are uses they're actually in terms
of sort of output filtering for a
switching power supply like a vrm these
are actually superior to tantalum
polymer capacitors so yeah and there's
actually the same number of these
capacitors on the on the 20 80 TI Strix
as there are on the 20 80 TI founders
edition so Asus actually managed to
literally just like add more capacitors
on top of what you would normally get on
the founders edition which is kind of
interesting because initially you'd
think oh they just replaced all the
capacitors that Nvidia had in aluminum
as like in the SMD package in the flat
SMD packages now they kept those they're
all on the back as well as you have some
on the front here and then they added
all of these on top of that I don't know
how much of a difference that actually
makes probably maybe like 10 20
megahertz on like if you tested a
hundred cards you might see like a 10
megahertz 20 megahertz difference
generally speaking extra capacitance
helps more as you crank up your power
consumption but considering how power
limited these cards are and the fact
that they probably don't scale with v
core again you know it's nice like it is
you know definitely an upgrade it's just
I don't think you're gonna notice that
there is a difference it's kind of like
shaving 10 kilograms of weight off of a
off of a supercar it does like yeah it's
lighter by 10 kilograms it's not
actually gonna make a difference in it
to like not make a noticeable difference
to the user
so those are some of the upgrades Asus
has done but there's more upgrades so
not only have they gone from the the
weird thirteen phase to a weird 16 phase
and what the reason why this is a weird
16 phase is that yes indeed the voltage
controller is still the same MP 2888 so
ten phases 500 megahertz switching
frequency not 500 that would be
ridiculous and this is actually running
in 10 faves mode so they do actually
have like 10 phases interleaving the
thing is there's gonna be some phases on
here which actually have multiple power
stages hooked up to them which means
this is like this is not really a 16
this doesn't have 16 phases interleaving
it has 10 but some of the phases might
be coming and going depending on how
much load the card is under so you know
it's it's kind of this weird hybrid
thing where it's like it's not really a
16 but it's not really a 10 either
because it it does kind of dynamically
change how many phases it has so yeah
and that's that that's the same
monolithic Power Systems chip that you
had on the founders Edition which
actually interesting sidenote
apparently there's founders additions to
any a TTI's with a you p90 512 which is
actually an eight phase-- controller not
a 10 phase so that's kind of interesting
you can actually get two different
variants of the founders Edition but I
think for the the asus strix card you're
gonna always get the mp-28 88 just
because if you'll notice that like if
you look if you saw the founders Edition
PCB analysis then you'd notice that that
PCB looks almost like it's a prototyping
card because there are so many
unoccupied solder points like there is
tons and tons of unused SMD component
mounts and that's basically because
Nvidia wants to be like I assume that's
done because they switch voltage
controllers between foundries additions
like they do two different variants with
one with the U P UPI semiconductor chip
and one with the monolithic power cyst
chips like chip like this card anyway
the next upgrade that asus has done yes
the they're upgrading all the things a
small amount but a noticeable amount is
that they've actually upgraded the power
stages themselves as well so on the
founders edition you to have Fairchild
Semiconductor Zeff DMF 31 70 power
stages here you get Texas Instruments
CSD 95 4 that's not a five that's a four
ninety five that's not a five either 95
four 80s and these are also 70 M smart
power stages so smart power stages are
smart because they integrate things like
temperature monitoring as well as very
accurate current monitoring directly
into the chips and the cool thing about
the CSD 95 for a for a TS is that these
are actually unlike the fairchild chips
these are SPECT all the way up to one
point two five megahertz switching
frequency whereas the fairchild ones
were only up to one megahertz and
admittedly they're not particularly
efficient at that frequency but they can
do it like they will work up to that and
if you are you were so inclined as to
use them at that frequency you can and
the really cool feature that like is
just kind of insane is these have o
upped like these will do 95% efficiency
or better all the way up to 30 amps
current output so yeah at the the lower
current outputs that this fear like
parfaits this vrm is not going to be
pushing 30 amps for like a while like
you'd need to lift the power limits and
everything to get like average over 30
amps through each of these power stages
the end result is that this vrm is
insanely efficient because the these
power stages are like they're more
efficient than what you get on the the
founders edition so basically like the
founders edition of erm i like already
its massive overkill it won't have any
sir it shouldn't have any thermal issues
and in fact in the in the thermal
testings that Steve's done the the vrm
ran it like 90 degrees and we all know
that the founders editions cooling
system is just kind of terrible as far
as the vrm is concerned I mean it's
covered by a vapor chamber isn't really
making great contact with it so you can
already see how the ridiculous vrm
efficiency there pays off you don't
really need to worry about cooling the
vrm because it kind of doesn't get hot
to start with but this just takes the
whole not getting hot part a step
further because these are even more
efficient and actually capable of going
up to higher switching frequencies so
the end result is that this V curve erm
pushing current into the core and you
know from both sides and there are
benefits to the the the funky vrm layout
we have here that you don't normally see
and there are benefits and I've
explained them in the founders edition
video so if you want to hear about those
you can go watch the founders edition of
the video so for the actual current rate
while current versus vrm efficiency
capabilities where we still run into the
issue of the vrm is rated entirely at
1.8 volts output voltage so we're gonna
do be doing 1.8 volts out and 1.2 volts
out which this is scaled against a IR
3575
and that's just because that datasheet
is convened convenient for me to use I
use the 35 75 also for scaling down the
F GM f31 70 s so this is very like that
like the the ratings under the 1.2 volts
are gonna be very like very it should
probably be around something like that
they're not accurate they're not dead-on
because they're just scaled off of a
different chips different chips of
voltage output voltage versus efficiency
curve and that may or may not be
accurate at all but it should be
relatively close and it's better than
just you know going with like yeah 1.8
volts expect lower which I got really
sick and tired of to uh which I like
because all of these cards are using
these 70 M power stages I've just kind
of gotten sick of doing that so it's
just like I don't want to do that we're
gonna scale them down according to the
3575
for the actual operating parameters of
the VR MMX going with 600 kilohertz
switching frequency because the texas
instrument datasheet is not
respect at below 600 kilohertz
whatsoever
and 5 volts drive voltage well power
voltage will just call it 5 volts VCC
naught V core that's 5 volts for the
power of the actual power stages because
that's why we have that 5 volt rail on
the card anyway so the end result is
that say 200 amps output current which
this so 202 sorta is 300 amps you're
going to be looking at that current
range for like stock settings and at 200
amps you'd be looking at around 17 watts
of heat for 1.8 volts output and at 1.2
volts it would drop down to about 14
watts of heat so basically this this
this will run pass if you have like you
know you have less than one watt of heat
per phase at 3 at 200 amps output now
when you go up to 300 amps start seeing
about 26 watts of heat at 1.8 volts and
about 21 watts of heat at 1.2 volts so
the interesting thing is actually 300
amps output 1.2 volts is actually the
same rating that the founders Edition
was getting for 200 amps 1.8 volts but
admittedly the different voltages so
there's there's minor improvements
compared to the founders Edition like
the founders Edition at 1.8 volts 200
amps was doing about 20 watts this is
doing 17 so you know 3 watts less now
1.2 volts this is doing 14 instead of if
I remember correctly something like 16
to 17 on the on the founders Edition so
really not a huge improvement in these
low current ranges and the reason for
that is basically the like as you keep
adding phases you basically in your
improvement in efficiency is much higher
what at like higher currents so at these
200 amp to 300 amp ranges there's not
that much difference but as we start
going up the current range you're gonna
start seeing major sort of major drops
in the like bigger differences in the
vrm efficiency from this to the founders
edition obviously you're not actually
able to push this much power through
these cards because NVIDIA doesn't allow
the board partners to ship the
cards with a high enough power limit in
my opinion at least I don't think
there's a single 20 atti out there
that's gonna have more than a 400 watt
power limit if even that so yeah and so
far that looks to be exactly what's
going on so anyway so for 400 amps and
at this point we're sort of getting into
like 300 - for em like 200 to 300 amps
is gonna be the sort of stock really
around 250 is gonna be stock on average
300 - sort of 400 amps I'm gonna say is
overclocking on sort of air / water
without any kind of power modifications
if you did some power modifications it's
quite possible that you might exceed 400
amps so 400 amps output you'd actually
be looking at about 37 watts of heat at
1.8 volts and about 30 watts of heat at
one point - so you know great efficiency
just across the board these power sit
like these more power stages from TIR
absolutely ridiculous now 500 amps need
to be looking at about 48 watts of heat
which is just like insane like that that
is like very little heat output for how
much current this vrm would be pushing
and still we're doing in like the high
night like you know close to that 95%
efficiency figure because yeah these
power stages are ridiculous and then so
500 amps you know 1.8 volts 48 watts I
won't point two volts you'd be looking
at more like 39 watts
600 amps output they're gonna be looking
at about 69 watts of heat at 1.8 volts
in about 55 watts of heat at 1.2 volts
and this is what basically I expect for
like extreme overclocking so dry ice or
liquid nitrogen you know especially a
liquid nitrogen towards the the bottom
end of that so and then for finally at
seven hundred amps you'd be looking at
about 96 watts of heat for 1.8 volts and
about 77 watts of heat at 1.2 volts so
the crazy thing is the founders edition
addition at 700 amps is actually around
125 watts of heat output so there that's
where you start like seeing a pretty
major drop in actual vrm Heat each
output and the end result is just like
honestly like up to around like 500 amps
output this vrm should be perfectly fine
if you just give it air flow in terms of
like cooling concerns so running this
thing like this card on like right the
founder's addition already I think you
could totally run that on liquid
nitrogen and not run into any major
issues as long as you give it enough
airflow this you know you might be even
able to just like run benchmarks for it
for like you could potentially finish
like stress tests on on liquid nitrogen
like the vrm here is insane and
especially if you still like if you
especially if you actually had some kind
of like heatsink on top of the RM and
had airflow going through that then yeah
this is gonna handle absolutely
ridiculous amounts of power and you know
it just it's not gonna get hot this is
it's so so damn out there like this is
this is one of the most powerful VRMs on
a GPU ever this right here like even if
you compare it to like a 980 TI
hall-of-fame or a or a 1080 TI
hall-of-fame which both of those had 16
phase v rms those were on 60 amp hour
stages these are 70 amps and those power
stages I think were actually like not
even capable of hitting that 95%
efficiency figure that these can do in
the lower current ranges basically at
all so these are like this VR M is
amazing it's just really unfortunate
that you know in in this in the stock to
the normal overclocking power draw
ranges you're not really gonna notice
that there's much of a difference with
it but yeah Asus has just gone above and
beyond and I really really hope that you
know we we see some extreme overclocking
results from them on this thing because
they have the voltage mod points it's
like hopefully it's just a matter of
time before somebody Isis decides to
take one of these I'll
- because it's equipped for it like
definitely really well equipped for that
now then let's move on to the memory the
RM for the memory of erm the controller
is a up9 512 and it's some kind of weird
variant of the 9 512 because this is not
the 8 phase version so there's a 95 12
that's an eight phase-- there's not this
one right here is actually only up to
four phases it's not the 8 phase flavor
and that's because it's been controlling
the memory of erm which is a 1 2 3 phase
and again we're seeing the same you know
ridiculously overkill CSD 95 480 power
stages so this this memory of erm
basically ends up in the same situation
as the founders Edition even if it was
pushing 40 amps which it won't the GDD
are 6 really shouldn't pull that much
current you're gonna be looking at about
3.5 watts of heat on that and this
straight up doesn't need a heatsink
at all like this really shouldn't need a
heatsink whatsoever under basically any
conditions so yeah asus basically took
everything the founders edition was and
and they just made it better so though
there's not that they've not really
worked on the memory VR I'm much more
than only what you saw in the founders
Edition but yeah this is absolutely
freaking ridiculous compared to the
while compared to really any card ever I
can't actually think of a card that has
a more powerful VR I'm off the top of my
head right now and I've looked at a lot
of graphics cards and I can't think of
it like yeah I straight-up can't think
of a stronger vrm so yeah
and I think the for a lot of the custom
cards were like what when the custom
cards start rolling out this we will be
seeing more 16 phase VRMs for definitely
we're gonna be seeing more 16 phase VRMs
we might even see some higher phase
counts but I think at that point they're
gonna start running it like straight up
running out of space all in the PCB and
Asus already ran into that because they
had to extend the PCB a bunch just to
cram that 16 phase on there so the this
might be the limit and you
what if this is the limit I'd say the
limit is is great this is a very good
limit to run into so yeah absolutely no
complaints for me for the Strix card
it's just a straight upgrade over the
founders edition though it is worth
noting you're probably not gonna notice
now then what to do if you don't like in
videos overly strict power limit while
Asus makes this really easy because
you're freaking shunt resistors for the
eight pins are right next to the actual
eight pins unlike the founders Edition
where the shunts are somewhere in this
corner of the card for no apparent
reason I think it's actually to
accommodate blower fans that they do
that well no that doesn't make sense
shunts are low-profile they could have
stuck them anywhere so yeah if you want
to lift the power limit lift it off of
the eight pins don't lift it with this
shunt down here that one's hooked up to
the PCIe slot these are five milli ohm
shunt resistors you can't actually read
it but it says are zero zero five on
them and that basically tells you
there's zero point zero zero zero five
ohms and in my the best way to lift the
power limit on the 20 like if you want a
permanent solution for lifting the power
limit on a twenty series and you don't
want to do the liquid metal thing
because it may or may not dissolve your
solder and cause other issues as well as
just being a liquid metal on liquid
metal being kind of a pain to clean up
in some scenarios actually in all
scenarios it's a pain to clean up if you
actually really like one to do your
power limit drop properly my
recommendation would be to just solder a
0.003 milli ohm resistor right on top of
the existing shunts and if you do that
you're gonna end up with a power limit
that's about 2.6 times higher well now
we're like 2.7 times higher than stock
if you want even more of a power limit
increase then you're gonna want to go
with like a what 0.001 5 ohm resistor
and then you're gonna get something like
a 4.4 X increase in power limit at which
point you really shouldn't be hitting
the power limit at all even on like
liquid nitrogen you shouldn't be hitting
the power limit
for the power monitoring actual chips if
you want to do your power limit
modifications the hard way as in like
disconnecting the stock power limit
monitoring circuitry and rewiring it
you're gonna have to deal with these
guys right here and those are the same
chips as on the founders edition these
are NCP four five four nine ones I would
not recommend this because these have
much smaller SMD components around them
than what you would find on like a 10
series card with the eye on a 3-2 to one
it's much easier to just deal with the
shunts directly so yeah that covers the
the 20 atti Strix I really really like
this card it's just really unfortunate
that you know Asus I mean Nvidia won't
allow the board partners to let the
cards uh stretch the vrm so to speak
because yeah this is gonna be some stuck
around like somewhere in this current
range just because of the power limits
well hey if you want to you can lift it
and at least you know that if you do
lift it you're don't have to worry about
the vrm here at that point you might
have to worry about your power supply
and possibly if you I also wouldn't
recommend like if you do lift the power
limit to that two point seven times
level I would recommend not using a
daisy-chained eight pin like if you
don't use one of those cables that is
like one cable to the PSU and then to
eight pins on the end because at that
point you're gonna run the risk of
actually melting the cables because the
card could actually go as far as pulling
something like you know 500 Watts down
the down the daisy chain and that can
end very badly so yeah that's it for the
end said for the board analysis here and
thank you for watching like share

that in the
description below as well as in the

this card is sitting on and the one
you'll be getting won't be as dirty as
this one so yeah check that out and if
you'd like to see more of my stuff I
have a channel called actually hardcore
overclocking where I do a lot of
hardcore overclocking so yeah thank you
