Donna and I am joined by Matt Greene
from Logitech and today we we just did a
pretty cool tour of the entire Logitech
acoustics facility so behind us behind
this closed door we've got an anechoic
chamber which is actually somewhat
disoriented being in there it's a little
bit weird but could you could you give
us an overview of what it is what its
purpose is sure so an anechoic chamber
is basically a room designed for
measuring sound and you can't just
measure sound in any room because the
walls and the floor and the ceiling and
all the objects in the room will reflect
the sound back at you and what you end
up measuring is more of a measurement of
the room than the speaker the headphone
or whatever it is you're trying to
measure so we build an anechoic chamber
which is isolated from the outside world
it has its own foundation separate from
the building it's got a spring bed on
the ground to isolate it from vibration
and then inside of the room the entire
room is covered with four-foot deep foam
wedges and what those do is absorb sound
so if I speak in that room my voice goes
out and gets absorbed into the wall and
doesn't bounce back and in that's a bit
why you can feel a little weird in there
because you're used to having echo
around you but it allows us to put a
product in there and measure it and just
measure what it's doing without any
reflections and you have a special da
man there named hats what is what his
hat stand for again yeah hats stands for
head and torso simulator and he's
basically a mannequin built to simulate
us our ears our torsos so that we can
put a headphone on him and measure how
that headphone will perform in a real
life situation as if it were on a person
very cool so the anechoic chamber is
something that we did get to see earlier
and there's some b-roll of it like you
said spray me floor and it's it's all
very interesting I think for for this
you kind of have to be there
understand just how much sound it
actually does absorb the other thing
we're looking at was the new driver for
the new headsets yeah which I've just
launched or been announced rather so
what can you tell me about the pro g
driver why is it different than the
previous drivers ok for artemis spectrum
we really wanted to bring up the
performance of the audio and you got to
start at the heart of the system which
is the driver and so for the pro g
driver we focused a lot on what we call
the diaphragm and that's basically the
material in the front that moves and
vibrates to create sound you need a
really light material because it has to
be easy to move and yet light materials
are not very strong and so they can bend
and when when it bends you get
distortion and eventually the sound
quits being accurate and eventually
quits coming out altogether because it's
bending so much it can't push air
forward and so the engineering behind
the procede driver was really taking the
material that's usually just kind of a
sheet stamped out in plastic and weaving
it instead so that you have a cone now
that's just as light but it's it's
better able to move without breaking up
and bending and crackling and distorting
and there was in the demo one of the
things we saw was a sort of playback of
the speakers and drivers in action and
there was on the screen there was a
video showing how the driver responded
to the different I guess outputs mm-hmm
what was it we were looking at there
yeah so that's a picture that gets put
together when we put a laser on the
driver and observe its behavior and the
laser can piece together how it's moving
so when it's all moving up and down
uniformly that's nice that sounds good
it sounds correct when it starts to rock
back and forth or even ripple like waves
if you were to splash in water that's
bad that's when there's distortion and
the sound isn't coming out properly and
so what you saw was that when the laser
scanned a traditional headphone driver
it's not very uniform when you go high
in free
1c but with the pro G driver it remains
much more uniform as you go high in
frequency so the all the detail and the
clarity from the pro G driver is much
better than from a traditional driver
what sorts of things go into the
engineering of that that particular test
what are you trying to do to resolve it
so that it's more uniform in the driver
movement well we need to study material
properties and understand how materials
will behave we need to understand the
the physics behind how the driver will
move and then we need to understand how
the motion translates into sound waves
and so it's it's a lot of steps along
the way and some of it we model some of
it we just build and measure but we need
to be able to piece it all together very
cool stuff so the the new headset give
us can you walk us through quickly the
MSRP and the two new models yes so
Artemis spectrum has the sick g 633
model which is a wired version which
will sell for 149 in the US and then the
g9 33 is the wireless version which will
sell for 199 in the u.s. so that is the
new logitech hardware and a quick look
at some of the labs that we walked
through for a more detailed look at
everything hit the link in the
description below and we've got all the
photos another video that may be of
interest to you thanks again for your
time thank you and we will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
