products in a world where MSRP acted as
an infallible decree handed down by
Galactic overlords the GT 1030 would
cost $70 the RX 560 would cost $100 and
the G 45 60 would have always been $60
in this world the real one the GT 1030
has now used served both the GTX 1050
and rx 560 in price landed at 110 to 120
dollars for a really low end graphics
card and the G 45 60 has actually fallen
in price oddly down to 60 from an
overpriced $80 previously and then the
our 320 200 G and r5 2400 G entered the
market priced at 100 and $170
respectively before that this video is
brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below to recap our
previous coverage of Raven Ridge
basically we bought the APS and we
immediately did some d lid and extensive
thermal coverage if you want that go
check the previous videos today we're
focusing only on gaming benchmarks no
power no thermals no nothing other than
gaming because ultimately aps are meant
to go in gaming machines that are
low-end so ap use the argument is that
it is for price conscious users this
means that there's no room for the usual
wishy-washy this part's fine except if
you have $20 more you can buy this one
or $20 less you buy this one there's no
room for that you either buy it or you
don't because when it's cut when it
comes down to these cheap parts the
alternatives are a G 45 60 and a GC 1030
for some price or an r3 and a GT 1030 or
something like that so a GT 1030 should
be $70 it's presently at time of filming
a 110 to 115 which just really
because that's what the 1050 in the 560
were priced originally but that's the
world we live in the are the G 45 60 was
$80 it's now 60 and the R 3 CPU is about
$100 so ultimately you're looking at an
r3 plus a GT 1030 they'll just pick that
one for now because it's what we tested
those come out to about $200 kind of
insane
a G 45 16 a 1030 thanks to the new in
4560 price reduction comes out to about
170 to 200 depending on where and when
you buy it the R 3 and R 5 ap use are
$100 and $170 which is what makes the
argument sort of tempting and
interesting especially for the our 320
200 G we think that's the rock star that
you should be looking to because it's
$70 cheaper than the r5 and it's pretty
damn close to it in performance as
you'll see today so for that previous
coverage check the thermal content
otherwise today we're talking about
overclocking and gaming performance and
we also previously talked about DRAM
scalability where we tested memory
scaling for frequency for cache latency
and for channeling and you can find that
content elsewhere but starting out we
did a lot of overclocking on these AP
years please note that the gaming k5
gigabyte motherboard we used exhibited
some variability in the base clock so
although we would set a multiply of 39
point five or 39 we would often see
clocks that were a bit lower than 3900
because the base clock would fluctuate
between basically 96 point something and
101 to pay on how it felt so what that
means is that in the charts when you see
three point nine five gigahertz it's set
to that but it's possible that it was
dithering between whatever 96 times
thirty nine point five is versus a
hundred times thirty nine point five
let's just quickly put one of the memory
tests on the screen from previously as
well just to recap everyone we didn't do
fire strike or time spy or something
like that
we saw some decent scalability on the
APU as part of what we were testing was
how do these perform with different kits
of memory and we can cycle through a few
of the previous charts to show the
differences ultimately what we found was
that our Trident
the thirty two hundred megahertz seal 14
KITT seems to play better with the
motherboards we used and we tested
multiple of those and the AP use and so
that's what we're using for the main
testing and for the G forty five sixty
we're using twenty four hundred
megahertz Ram you can learn more about
why we made these choices in the test
methodology section linked in the
description below please click that link
before you ask questions it's probably
answered there so with all that said
articles below if you need more info on
previous content otherwise let's get
into the charted data for gaming today
getting straight into the eSports titles
we're starting on overwatch at 1080p
medium as discussed in our previous
bench Theory test duration content we
run five-minute test passes for
overwatch as its dynamic nature
introduces a lot of variants the
five-minute passes smooth this out you
can learn more about our overwatch
testing methodology over in the bench
Theory Series previously the GT 1030
results are close to margin of error of
one another there's some overlap and so
we can call the GT 1030 with a forty
five sixty and twenty four hundred
megahertz Ram as appreciably equal in
performance to the overclocked are 329
33 megahertz memory and GT 10:30 the and
the r5 2400 G overclocked to three point
ninety five gigahertz and sixty hundred
megahertz on IGP performed respectively
close to the discrete devices the part
lands at 60 FPS average with lows
similarly scaled to its competition the
apu ends up within margin of error of
the GT 10:30 and 3.9 gigahertz r3 1200
with the g 45 60 and 1030 running a
couple percentage points ahead stock the
r5 2400 g with 32 hundred megahertz CL
14 Ram performs at 54 FPS average
resulting in its overclocked granting a
12 percent jump over the stock apu stock
the 2400 g doesn't impress in this game
but it's overclocked changes the stack
significantly the are 320 200 g operates
at 50 FPS stock with a 2400 g leading by
about 7% for a $70 price increase that's
not a big jump in performance our 2200 g
overclocked the IGP a bit higher than
our 2400 g and ended up at 55 point 5
FPS average it seems that there's some
inherent
- these 2400 G over the 2200 e4
overwatch it's just a question of
whether that's worth $70 to you for an
extra couple percentage points of
performance and that depends on how much
you care about this one game
rocket League has the discrete parts
placing in the top of the chart plotting
within margin of error of one another
this is an instance where we've become
bound by the GT 1030 and not by their
partnered CPUs and illustrates why we
eliminate bottlenecks and discrete
component reviews this however is not
one of those integrated GPU testing
requires a more value driven method
rather than a perfectly clean test
method the are 524 G lands at around 61
FPS average when overclocked placing
it's average FPS within our error
margins for the top two discrete results
these are functionally equivalent an
average framerate they are not
equivalent in lows however we noticed
that the apu underperformed in 0.1
percent lo metrics something we can
better show with this frame time plot
the harder stutters are rare fortunately
but they do occasionally pop up and get
noticed
overall the are 524 G is doing well to
keep up with two dedicated processing
components but the two discrete
components are still doing a bit better
back to the chart the our 320 200 G
stock apu who places at about 54 FPS
average led by the stock 2400 G by about
7.5% once again for a $70 difference
this gap doesn't seem worth the jump
even low-end frame time performance
isn't all that disparate between the two
AP years overclocked in the 2200 g
pushed it to 60 FPS average impressively
within standard deviation of discrete
component performance and highlighting
again that the 2200 g is really the part
to look at here again the low-end frame
time performance here isn't impressive
not in this game but for $100 part we do
have to remark again that this is
hands-down very impressive AP is in the
past things more similar to this one for
example have not done too well it's
basically always come down to really
wishy-washy like well you could use it
in this specific HTPC build I guess but
ultimately a lot of the time you can buy
a discrete component when the whole
shortage thing didn't exist and as cheap
CPU and you'd get better performance for
gaming that's changed
Eisen and Vega together have really done
a lot for the APU discussion for Andy
the 2400 G however really struggles to
look valuable in the face of its own
alternative the 2200 G its brother
basically so in this testing so far and
we haven't gone through all of it the
$100 2200 looks really damn good because
it's $100 a GT 1030 with a G 45 60 which
is also incredibly impressive and
performance for the price it doesn't
come close in terms of price to
performance even though the 2200 G is a
bit behind in some scenarios you can
always drop settings a little bit to
recover some of those frame time
differences so quite a good show so far
but we do have a couple more charts to
go through let's move on to Sniper Elite
Four this game is sort of a best case
for AMD hardware whereas something like
Source engine games can be more of a
worst case tonight for at leats
asynchronous compute and proper dx12
implementation are well leveraged on the
APU first note that this is 1080p high
the settings are aggressive for an APU
and you should drop to lower settings if
you're actually going to play this game
the point however is to use the higher
settings because we already have a lot
of GPUs tested with this game so we have
some extra data we can show treat this
more like a synthetic test though know
that the scaling is linear as settings
are reduced so all scales relatively
equally anyway we just like this 4 d GPU
data one more note the D GPUs if not
otherwise listed we're tested on our
7700 K GPU test platform so you get an
unrestrained to look at lower end GPU
performance but not an equivalent look
in terms of price obviously we still
have the GT 1030 and the cheap CPU for
that the are 524 G experience is at 10%
uplift when an overclock from baseline
the GT 10 30 and 45 60 using the slower
memory mind you at 2400 Hertz end up
with a stock r5 leading by a noteworthy
17% the overclocked are five leads the
GT seven thirty and forty five sixty by
29% with again no overclocking on the
1030 and none can be done with 45 60 the
2400 G does well in this game and would
clearly be the better option to the GT
10 30 and 45 60 we don't have data on
this one for the 2200 G though our
civilization 6 benchmarks use turn time
as a metric for performance rather than
frames per second this is for a few
reasons one of which is that FP
analysis terrain sieve is largely
irrelevant and the other is that it can
often be invalid the longer a processor
takes to complete a turn the higher its
framerate in other words slower
processors perform better in fps value
depending on how you test which is
because they spend more time staring at
an unchanging screen to process the turn
because this doesn't rely upon GB is
retesting we can show all other CPUs
we've tested lately any CPU with
unspecified memory speeds is running at
3,200 megahertz in our testing we found
that over clocks are 524 G to perform
roughly equivalent lead to the r5 1600 X
and turn time processing
planning at about 19 to 20 seconds per
turn for five players it would take
about one point six minutes to complete
a full round until your next turn stock
the 2400 G completes its turns
approximately 2 seconds slower than
overclocked granting the overclocks
2400 G at 9% turn time reduction the
overclocked 2200 G completes its turns
in about twenty four point seven seconds
with a stock 2200 G distant from the
pack down at twenty seven point five
seconds the stock 2400 G does hold a
meaningful time reduction of 22 percent
over the stock 2200 G and the
overclocked two variants put the 2400 G
as 21 percent reduced we haven't yet run
the G 45 60 in his bench but the R 3
1300 X runs between the stock and
overclocked r5 2400 G CPU entries csgo
was one of the more sensitive games to
memory changes as we discussed
previously we're still using the tried
NZ kit as our baseline as it worked the
best with the gaming k5 and the AP use
the r5 2400 G stock CPU performs at 95
FPS average with lows reasonably in
lockstep the our 320 200 G operates at
86 FPS average permitting the 24 energy
a lead of 10.5% the discrete components
land between 111 and 120 FPS average
which is a substantial lead over the
overclocked and similarly priced between
0 and $20 different our 520 400 G the ro
322 energy is the real winner here at
$100 it's providing 83% of maximum
performance as rated relatively versus
the chart-topping combo
to achieve 83% of performance at 58% of
price plus or minus the impact of $10 is
pretty damn impressive granted this is
after we overclocked the r3
APU but overclocking is not particularly
hard on these CPUs anyway rise and
master makes it more accessible than
before despite a preference for bios
overclocking for this title specifically
we'd recommend either the 2200 g4
something ultra cheap or the discrete
component combination the r5 2400 G has
limited usefulness in its price bracket
for this particular title dota 2 will
likely mirror csgo given the same roots
but let's take a look we've become GPU
bound and dota 2 with the G 45 60 and
overclocked r3 1200 both maintain in 63
FPS average either would be a suitable
choice for our settings the our 320 200
G with a 16 50 megahertz GPU overclocked
roughly ties the overclocked r5 2400 GE
both at 52 51 FPS average joining 4G it
does manage to maintain advantaged 1%
low frame times though stock the 24 of G
holds a 45 FPS average with a stock 2200
G not meaningfully different it would
seem that we are bound elsewhere in the
stack total war hammer at 1080p medium
at places the overclocked AP use and
commanding positions managing to take
the top two slots with the IGP overclock
there are three 1200 and GT 1030 follow
in third with the are 320 200 G
outperforming this discrete combo by
roughly 6 percent the r5 leads the r3 by
about 10% thanks to the game's actual
utilization of additional resources as
for stock the AP has run behind the
discrete components our r5 24 energy
stock apu operated at 35 FPS average
with overclock in the 24 g granting a
significant 20 ish percent uplift we
also have some 1080p high results in
Ghost Recon results for scaling
performance in the written review linked
below
so that recaps the performance a couple
things here as always if you're new with
any kind of game benchmarking we can
only speak to two things the game as we
tested and the games related to the
games we tested that's why we choose a
smaller suite of games that uses known
engines ideally something a little bit
different for each one while still being
popularly played titles so with the
games we've tested and ignoring all
other factors focusing strictly on
gaming performance what we're in is a
situation where if you're buying a 100
to $170 product you probably don't care
about things like necessarily
consumption or thermals although we
covered that extensively and they're
fine or things like that we care about
is game fronts for the dollar for the
dollar the APU that hands down gets our
recommendation if you're really
struggling to piece something together
would be the our 320 200 G you have a
lot fewer expansion options going
forward with an r3 2200 G it's more
limited on the CPU side if your plan is
to fill what I would assume is a more
limited use case but one that is still
somewhat common if your plan is to fill
the system with a DGP later a discrete
card and upgrade and keep the other
thing as a CPU then you're gonna be more
limited with a 2200 that's just how it's
gonna be
so that's your use case you can or the
recommendation but if it's not if you're
just trying to build something cheap
that games pretty well we like the 2200
G a lot at $100 it's really good value
it's within single-digit percentage
points in most cases of the 2400 G and
it's behind yes the discrete components
but it's $100 and the 4560 with the GT
1030 which we also really like by the
way those two parts are closer to 170 on
a good day plus or minus a bit so either
way you look at it you're at least
seventy dollars cheaper with the 2200 G
now of course you would want to go with
faster memory we did some memory
frequency and kit scaling and a previous
content piece if you're curious about
the impact of 2429 33 3200 whatever
check the content will tell you there
how much it matters to buy the kits I
believe our conclusion was something
along the lines of 29 33 is perfectly
fine it's not a huge performance
disparity if you can save another $10
there or what it depends on your region
then do it because ultimately if you're
buying a $100 part saying well but going
up to 3200 from 29:33 is only $13 more
no stop it
no it's like bad because what you're
doing that game when you're saying it's
only $13 more that's a 13% increase on
what you're spending on the APU when
you're spending that much more money
you're getting close to just doing
either the higher-end APU and then still
spending $13 more or doing discrete
components because if you buy a 2400 G
at $170 or whatever it is and you're
spending an extra couple bucks to go
from 29:33 to 3200 depending on your
region and where you live then you're
entering territory where the price is
now at equivalents with the discrete
components and 2400 megahertz of RAM so
consider that keep that in mind that's
why the 2400 G doesn't impress enough
frequently enough in these titles mind
you to really get an outright
recommendation it's fine
but there's nothing special about it the
2200 G is quite special in that it's
very affordable it's surprising how well
it performs with reasonably high
settings and you can stick 29:33
megahertz of memory in there and be
quite happy with it in the US the memory
prices aren't as disparate as in other
regions we've looked sometimes going
from 29 33 or 2666 to 3200 can be a big
jump so you don't necessarily lose a lot
by going with slightly slower memory
it's not as crazy needed as just going
with two sticks of it that's important
but the couple hundred megahertz jump
not quite as much and if you're value
driven then keep the value in mind spend
the money on something else that's also
important for your system like cooling
or whatever it may be so yeah recapping
this briefly from a games we've tested
we quite like the 2200 G the 2400 G we
don't really feel like there's a good
spot for it that's as clear of a
standout like screaming by me spot in
the market it's one of those things you
look at and more or less way the options
at the time what is the discreet
combination cost what is the 24 energy
cost it might be better to buy the
discreet combination in a lot of these
tests the GT 1030 and an R 3 or a G 45
60 and the the latter being more
comparable in price were decently better
than the 24 energy
for not withstanding and games like
sniper doom would likely be factored in
Wolfenstein would likely be factored in
so those games notwithstanding if you're
looking at eSports titles and you're
trying to spend about two hundred bucks
the discrete combination still looks
better but if you're trying to spend
less we do like the 2200 G is worth
buying so those would be my two choices
based on the data we've collected it's
2,200 G and cheap discrete combo not a
lot of space for the 2400 G until it's
price drops and it will it'll eventually
come down once it's 150 that'll be a
really compelling argument but at 170
not quite so much so that's it for now
