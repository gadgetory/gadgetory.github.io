color sweet looking at their new gaming
station external graphics enclosure and
the new red devil fifty six eight hey
don't mind me I just need this for my
money Greek joke joke shirt
so that was Joker productions by the way
link to him in the description below but
power colors got a Vega 56 variant of
their Vega 64 card that we talked up
previously and they also have an updated
external graphics enclosure following
their devil box previously I'll start
with this because it's really easy the
Vega 56 card is literally the Vegas 64
cooler so you already saw us to a tear
down of that cooler same thing they've
addressed the thermal paste thing that
we talked about when we first took it
apart so that should be addressed I have
not opened this one but it's gonna look
the same power components are the same
everything's the same
so it's Vega 56 basically is the only
change there and pricing availability is
still kind of a mess with GPUs in
general across Nvidia and Andy I'm sorry
I don't have an actual price for you
because it goes up to X the minute cards
hit the market but we can talk about
this one so this is an external graphic
enclosure they're calling a gaming
station the basics of it it's got a 350
watt FSP power supply in the back and
that is it's a smaller form factor so
they do include it with a box
interestingly from a thermal perspective
the enclosures basically set up so
you've got this mesh panel on the GPU
fan side so if you have I guess a blower
or dual axial fans or triple axial fans
in this case and it should be able to
breathe through there there's no actual
direct intake though so there's no
intake on the front no intake on the
bottom the only fan in here is actually
an 80 millimeter exhaust in the bottom
front so that's pushing the air down and
into this undercarriage under the unit
at which point it graphs out of the case
or drafts out for the power supply that
one is currently installed in a way
that's facing right against the video
card we talked to them about that
perhaps this type of mesh panel will go
on the right side in the future so that
the power supply can just breathe
through one of these if it's facing
outward that would definitely be an
ideal setup for that graphics cards
supports
350 watts - the efficiency concerns and
obviously keeping your power supply
within spec so most of the cards on the
market until you start doing power play
tables which you shouldn't really be
doing with an external graphic started
anyway connects to be a thunderbolt as
expected and here's what they have it
connected to your so behind the V vagin
56 is an Intel nook so they just have
the Box plugged into the knife there's
no CPU in here nothing like that it's
all hosted here and then running I think
just synthetic heaven or Valley
benchmark for the demo show the card
operating at significantly more frame
rate than what the nut can handle that
pretty much wraps it up though I think
this one will have to loop back with
after seen if any changes happen for the
the sort of thermal configuration but
that's what they've got for power color
stuff
the big news sadly on video cards is
just that it's gonna stay difficult to
get them power color gigabyte sapphire
none of them really have any control
over that if you want video cards you
just kind of have to wait right now or
get lucky cuz I'll go into mining so
that's it for this one Joker was in the
beginning of the video just to list it
