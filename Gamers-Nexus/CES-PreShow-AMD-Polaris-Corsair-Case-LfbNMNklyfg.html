and we are here in las vegas for CES
2016 the Consumer Electronics Show got
some news out already the show hasn't
officially begun and won't until
Wednesday but a lot of meetings are
still going on today tomorrow all the
way through the week all of our CES 2016
coverage is brought to you by I by
powers revolt to small form-factor
gaming PC so a couple major news items
for today already would be AMD's at
polaris which is the next generation GPU
architecture 4am these video cards that
will be effectively stepping over Fiji
that's already out now on the fury X and
fury nano fury devices so polaris has a
new iteration of the gcn architecture or
graphics core next that will be the
fourth generation now in addition to
this it's increasing or improving its
geometry processor improving a couple of
the other processors coprocessors on the
GPU architecture and l2 cache is being
increased we don't have specifics or
numbers on any of these just yet but I
hope to have them when our AMD rolls
around which i think is on wednesday or
thursday so check back for that content
other news today includes an MLG
acquisition so MLG major league gaming
was bought by activision and that was a
46 million dollar acquisition most of
the money is going towards paying off
the debts incurred by MLG during its
operating lifetime and the business will
actually be shuttered going forward so
MLG is effectively no more and
Activision may be turning it into some
sort of new esports endeavor further
news from the virtual reality Department
oculus rift pre-orders will be opening
on wednesday no price is yet announced
but there will be one on Wednesday
certainly so check back for that and
this is just the pre-orders for the rift
the oculus touch handheld device the
controller is still delayed so that is
delayed until sometimes second half 2016
and we've already covered that in the
channel if you click the link the
description below the last major news
item for day today is Corsairs spec
alpha case this is the next case in
their spec line so there's the spec
Owens back go to some of those cases
they're big in Asia in the u.s. they
were rebranded as the
hundred series so the 100 are was the
main one and that is very similar to
silver stones ps11 B which it's actually
the same chassis just slightly different
exterior so that has been revived in the
spec alpha which uses three fans all 120
millimetres to 120 millimeters in the
front do an intake and there are no
optical drive cages so no obstruction
there coarser calls this direct flow
something rather some marketing term
that frankly all it means is that the
air goes straight in the front not the
back it's not special but ceasing to
intake fans with one exhaust fan then
they've got a side window which they
call a panoramic window another
marketing term I wasn't too happy with
because it's just a square window so by
definition not panoramic and a bit
overdone in the marketing because it's
just a side window but that is the spec
alpha some photos going through now
articles already on the site if you want
to read more about it and we will have
video and in-person coverage of course
there's booths in a couple of days so
check back for that that is all for this
quick recap of the news for CES 2016
pre-show and as always subscribe to the
channel if you like it hit the patreon
link the postural video and I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
