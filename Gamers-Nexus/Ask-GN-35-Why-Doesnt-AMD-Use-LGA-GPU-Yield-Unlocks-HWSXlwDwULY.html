ask GN as always if you have questions
leave them in the comment section below
I'll try to get to them for the next
episode we're trying to do one of these
per week now pretty consistent lately so
before getting to this episode which has
a couple of pretty interesting CPU and
GPU questions this content is brought to
you by Roseville and there : encase
which is right here
I just revisited this as an aside to the
570 accent to Sony are the two new
coarser cases that we reviewed on Monday
which is the day of filming for this but
we talked about those and revisited this
in that coverage this is a tempered
glass case tempered glass on the side
and on the front and also on the right
side from the perspective of the camera
it's got a tint to it which some of the
other cases don't and then as far as
price it's on sale this week for $120 so
that's pretty significant drop from the
original $150 asking price if you're
curious the original vendor of this case
actually also makes the Anna DS AI
crystal so you've seen the AI crystal
which for a brief while was one of
really the only new tempered glass cases
on the market right after Computex after
this was shown they came out with theirs
and they actually come from the same
source they're both from Jones bow which
is a sort of OM designer company and
they put together a lot of cases like
this so really comes down to the logo
that's in it and then things like
warranty and price which right now this
one's cheaper so that's the sponsor
first question that this time is shoot I
don't have the oh this is from an older
video but I finally got an answer to it
so I don't have the contours name
written down but they asked hey Steve I
just wanted to know if there's any
particular reason for Andy to stick with
the PGA style of stock sockets for a m4
instead of LGA
so this question was asked a while ago I
thought it was a pretty interesting
question I sent it over to AMD and had
them paint a few different people
internally and figure it out so the
feedback the answer from the tactical
marketing team which is the only group
that really provided an answer is as
follows direct quote PGA packages
generally provide a thicker
processor package that is more resistant
to bending under the forces of a mounted
heatsink PGA's sockets are also less
expensive than LGA sockets which can
help reduce the cost of a motherboard
and for those who don't know
basically the options LGA is what Intel
pretty much uses for every socketed CPL
does use for every socket at CPU the
alternative being something that's
soldered to a board which it's not
really applicable here they use LGA
that's where the pins are in the board
in a socket and the CPU just has the
contacts on it with am these processors
as many of you likely know the processor
itself has the pins like AMD saying it's
a thicker package of the processor as a
result of that but the motherboard is
now less prone to potential damage like
bent pins so the motherboard socket
basically the pins feed into a cluster
of the holes for the pins and then
there's the contacts underneath hidden
under a plastic protective and mounting
layer so that's the socketing setup for
both devices and and the uses pga and
their answer to me it was that it's just
because the resistant to heatsink
bending and that the cost is lower both
valid answers so I didn't get more than
that but that's that's what we got for
now next question is from smoky dots 500
spoken
says I have a typical AMD or Nvidia
question regarding releases of different
GPU architectures with Nvidia's 10
series of GPUs we are seeing releases of
GP 107 106 104 and 102 do these
represent different architectures or
unique dies or do they represent the
common adage of flagship architecture
with components on die that failed
Quality Assurance question goes on for a
bit but that was the the basics of it so
this is kind of referring to for those
who don't know instances where you end
up with a product that is a or was
originally meant to be a higher end
product and has been sort of locked or
restricted because it failed in some
ways validation it's not a hundred
percent how it works with GPUs that is
how it works in some places
an example would be some of the older
AMD GPUs you could actually unlock and
get some more power out of them and that
was really more of a thing where there
was demand for a certain type of product
more than another and so Andy would
release more of those to fill the demand
that's it's kind of how it works in
general this also happens else from the
industry but for GPU specifically this
is another one where I reached out to
the vendor so ask them Vidya you know
the obvious thing to kind of point out
here is that when you look at the cards
like this is the EVGA FTW that we've
been working on for vrm temps that's got
a couple thermal probes still attached
with adhesive when you look at that dye
the dye package is a pretty visually
different size from what you would see
that's a 1080 for example on a 1050 Ti
GP 107 is much smaller so in that regard
if this concept were true what would
happen is you'd see something like this
a GPU 104 or whatever 102 package in its
full large size being placed onto
something like a 1050 Ti and then it
would be more limited in its performance
but the die would look the same size as
that that's obviously not how it works
you've all seen the tear downs at least
the ones that we've done if not
elsewhere and they're pretty obvious
smaller size as you go down the listing
the tearing of cards so then what
happens well when I reached out to
Nvidia they basically said for their
cards their GPU specifically if they are
underperforming or if they for some
reason don't function just from normal
yield yield is not 100% perfect for
really any electronic device especially
silicon so there's always something that
fails and what happens is they recycle
them somehow so not in a product as far
as I know but recycle them as in normal
recycling where you try to reuse stuff
and I actually go off-camera somewhat
have one I just remembered that I got
this years ago I think it's got the GPU
identifier rubbed off of it but this is
a failed NVIDIA GPU and I got this at
their silicon failure analysis lab we
toured it
probably 2013 or something and the guy
there is pretty pretty damn smart was
talking about how all their equipments
used like scanning electron microscopes
and things like that and magnifying
silicon to 1.5 million X so they kit
like mil a whole into the service middle
hole down into it and look at almost
basically a transistor level what's
going on when something fails pretty
cool stuff but I got this from him and
it's basically from Howard Marks his
name so it's a failed chip in this case
they just have a bucket of them and give
them out to visitors so that would be
one place that we used as opposed to
again in a lower to your card so I hope
that answers that question there are
places where parts are I won't use the
word recycle because confusing but are
reused in a lower tier product but the
current ski series of GPS is not one of
them with the 10 series I did ask and
I'm waiting on a response what about the
GTX 1060 s because there's two SKUs of
1060 s so in that specific case it's a
little unique because a 1060 you've got
the base model and then the 1063
gigabyte model which has ten percent
fewer SM so the question is 10 percent
fewer sm's is it a higher skew is it a
1066 gigabyte that's been restricted or
is this a separate line and
manufacturing that's producing these 10%
lower SM count chips specifically for
the three gigabyte cards have received
an answer die yet but I only asked a
couple hours before the video so next
question
Wesley Runyon says Steve why is it the
different benchmarks ultimately give
different answers for instance passmark
versus fire strike hash mark rates my
score with a 1070 from MSI gaming Z
better than a 1080 or even a Titan XP
then very similar pcs with less speed
ram clock so you see outperform mine
it's impossible to cheat the system or
software yeah yeah I know turn off all
the background apps etc etc not buying
it times blah blah not cutting it
that's kind of rolling over a lot of
what we do I monitor my hardware closely
and that excuse is nonsensical I am
curious to see what your opinion is of
synthetic benchmarks so synthetic
benchmarks are tough even just 3d mark
on the same system ignore all the other
systems you're talking on our cards you
run it a few times on the same system
there is variance and that can be the
difference between a card with one clock
trading places with card with another
clock and that's a problem so there's
reason we don't use 3d mark scores and
our reviews that may change at some
point but right now I just don't like
the very incident and I don't like the
idea that I have to run it several times
to average an answer that seems
reasonable because it's just it's as
extra work and it makes more sense for
me anyway to spend that time
benchmarking another game instead so we
can spend that time doing that but
that's three mark so past mark things
once you start mixing and matching tool
you can really can't look at these
things outside of their vacuum that
they're in so a pass mark 3d mark fir
mark they really are not meant to be
compared one against the other when
you're looking at scores it's sort of
look at it in a vacuum everything passed
mark everything 3d mark whatever as far
as why your card might outperform others
I don't I don't know specifically what
you're looking at but like I said
because the tools are so different it
could actually be the case that there's
a difference in memory or in the memory
clock on the GPU or something like that
well that might actually be significant
to the particular tool that you're using
an example of this would be fir mark fir
mark and combustor the MSI benchmarking
tool combustor contains variants of fir
mark that are branded by MSI I find them
to be a bit more abusive fir mark is
behaves like a power virus it burns the
vrm so basically that's what I've been
using on this thing it sort of sits
there and incinerates vrm to a point
that is not realistic for what you would
get in a game and the testing as you'll
see this week from this card will see a
difference of sometimes 20 Celsius and
vrm times probing the VRM the MOSFETs
directly when using a game like Doral
a Metro last light any number of modern
games battlefield as opposed to using
fur mark for mark always being the
hotter of the two so that's an instance
where when you're comparing two
different cards temperatures do actually
matter quite a lot because if you've got
as a better example maybe an AMD card
where there are different throttles in
place than on that video cards running
into those temperature limits with fur
mark would produce results that may look
worse for a car that's cooled worse at
like the Sapphire Platinum Series rx 470
which is a reference cooler that would
look worse than something like maybe a
gaming X even if both have the same
everything else and that's just because
of the cooling and because of boost
limitations as well so on the 10 series
cards because of the way Boost works if
it doesn't have thermal Headroom you're
going to get a lower clock and that will
impact your score so I don't know that
temps blahblah uh cutting it really
understand where you're coming from but
also temperatures are pretty important
depending on what you're testing now
once you're looking at the good cards
like a bunch of me a CX twin frozer
whatever else is its tricks those types
of coolers that are all pretty much
always below 80 Celsius then the
difference comes into play from things
like power target and power availability
so again an example might be if you're
testing over clocks or if you're even
without over clocks just because the way
GPU boost 3.0 where it's on Nvidia
you've got more power Headroom because
the vrm is designed to supply that power
like this card we can toggle to 130%
offset and that gives us something like
i'll top my head I'm not sure I think
it's like 245 watts total available
power something like that anyway that's
a pretty good impact also again on the
clock rate and on the clock stability
specifically so the clock rate may look
about the same in terms of the maximum
number but the stability of that number
will be greater as you reduce your
thermal Headroom as you increase your
power availability and as you increase
your voltage and those three things to
some extent are done automatically by
the card so this isn't just you going to
the MSI
after burn or whatever in changing it in
general synthetic benchmarks are not my
preferred way of testing things to
really put your question to the test
you'd have to kind of take one of each
device put it in the exact same rig and
test it because you don't know how
there's those tools or programs what
they care about in terms of system
resources like again is another final
example 3dmark if you're on the full 3d
mark test it will run a physics test in
there and that's not graphics processing
for the physics that's system physics
processing that goes on the cpu and so
you've got to graphics tests and one
physics tests three total test passes in
3d mark you're running a lower M CPU or
one of the different clock or maybe the
temperature was different this time
or maybe the voltage was different this
time because of all the C states and all
the ist and all this crap that's in BIOS
they have to disable to really get an
accurate run to run test something
changes your physics result could be
lower and that drags down how the card
looks and the same is true with these
other tools so that would probably be
your answer I think after going through
the rest it but I think that gives
everyone a bunch of different
contingencies to consider next question
is by the way that was a good question
because I think that is one needs to be
discussed but next question Peyton
Pringle says how comparable is
performance sustained at SSA a or super
sampling anti-aliasing at 1080 to 4k
assuming all other values are the same a
game settings computer hardware etc and
then Peyton Rangel goes on to elaborate
that super sampling and anti-aliasing is
basically rendering the game at a higher
resolution than sampling it down to the
display resolution for 1080p monitors
have the same resolution as a 4k monitor
so yeah 4k monitor if you got 3840 by
2160 something to the tune of a bit over
8 million pixels I think it's the same
number if you do 4 times 1920 by 1080 in
terms of raw pixel count so to answer
the question which is how do they
compare native 4k vs. super sampled I
did a test of that when D
sar &amp;amp; VSR were first posted the AMD and
NVIDIA techno and videos DSR and AMD as
VSR so those were their super Sandler
they're scaling examples where the game
would be rendered at the higher
resolution that you specify which could
be over the native monitor resolution
and then fit to the screen so you end up
with what appears to be AI or pixel
density and greater quality of image
this reflects itself mostly in things
like textures so if you look at a ground
texture or a cloth on an arm and
something like The Witcher 3 it's a
really good example where with DSR or
VSR you'll see greater detail in that
texture normally to the tune of things
like a more clear line in the fabric
rather than sort of a jagged line or
maybe you see lines and cross hatching
that you couldn't really perceive before
so that's where you see it performance
or I should say visible quality when we
took screenshots side by side years ago
they looked pretty much the same I'm not
sure if that's changed I don't think it
has but back last time I tested it they
did look in terms of like one screenshot
1080p sampled rendered at 4k down
sampled to 1080p screens whatever versus
a native 4k screen
they looked about the same so I I
haven't actually used as a user dsrvs
are I always just use the native
resolution but I'm sure there are good
reasons to use either one it's just not
something that I've done but it also
depends on what kind of hardware you
have so if you end up with this is a
good use case if you buy say you want a
10 7 8 10 80 whatever now or even an RX
480 and you have a 1080p display with a
480 and up all three of those devices
you could easily do 1440p so no harm in
rendering the game at 1440p and fitting
it to your 1080p display it will look
like there's greater pixel density and
quality will improve detail improve
mostly so hopefully that answers that
basically the answer is they look pretty
much the same to me last time we tested
it which
years ago also the the scaling
performance was about the same as
well.there within and percentage point
or support less being point one percent
one test last question is this yes
let's get techy asks Steve have you ever
considered growing a beard maybe not a
full-blown hillbilly beard but a beard
at nonetheless I think it would match
your hair like a boss hashtag of beard
life I'm going to stand very still so
that Andrew can mask in a beard on my
face and we'll see how it looks and
hopefully it is a full-grown hillbilly
period so thank you for watching I will
see you all next time
on we remain right here so that the mask
doesn't break and a subscribe for more
patreon like the postal video see you
next time
I'm the bad man</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
