by our team for use in tear downs PC
builds and enthusiast projects the mod
mah is an anti-static rubberized
material that stays in place and
protects your components from
electrostatic discharge using an
included common ground point to end
grounding strap the rubber surface
prevents components from slipping and
protects the table underneath from
cosmetic damage during builds and the
surface of the mat includes a screw
sorting grid for video card tear downs
an accurate ruler for millimetre
measurements CPU thermal paste
application guidelines based on hundreds
of hours of GN testing for optimal
methods and power cable pin outs and
wiring diagrams this high-quality mat is
our first truly custom product and is
built for use by our own team the mod
mat is table sized at 4 feet by 2 feet
and the quality speaks for itself at
nearly 4 pounds so this met it comes
with the common ground point comes with
the anti-static wrist you have to make
everything pretty easy on you which
allows you to ground the mat around
yourself to the common ground point and
then this terminates at the wall with a
loop that hooks around a ground pin for
just anything going into a ground socket
then the mat itself is a sturdy
rubberized anti-static material on the
top and the bottom and we have a custom
paint job on it and because these are
expensive to make and we're doing a
smaller order quantities to start
pre-ordering that means that you'll be
able to get yours during the first
production run pre-order now at the link
in the description below or visit store
dot gamers nexus dotnet slash mod matte
pick up one of these when they come out
they should be shipping in late January
to early February the factory we're
using to produce the mod matte make
stuff for cleaner so when you need to
make sure you're grounded you can use
our common ground point wrist strap and
the mat to protect the component
we're really excited about this product
because it's something that we will
actually use and everyday work in the
lab and we hope that you're excited
about it as well thank you for watching
