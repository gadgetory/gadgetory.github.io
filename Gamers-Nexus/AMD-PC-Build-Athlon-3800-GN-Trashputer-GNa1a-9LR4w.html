much of a joke this is our trash pewter
test bench I guess that Patrick Layton
built for the site so the plan here is
to use this to validate parts that we
don't necessarily trust with a real set
of components and not to down talk
what's in here but they're not really
mission-critical at this point so the
trash pewter
I basically asked Patrick to build this
because he recently became very
interested in purchasing with company
money lots of parts from Aliexpress that
are absolute garbage and reviewing them
to see if they are competitive in any
way with their real alternatives so
there are a lot of counterfeit mice a
lot of counterfeit or even I guess real
depending on how you define that LED
strips and stuff like that there were
plenty of Razer DeathAdder knockoffs
plenty of SteelSeries sensei knockoffs
all kinds of stuff and sometimes we've
had good luck with those other times not
so much so we decided to buy a couple of
those not too expensive of a project to
do kind of fun and different and then we
we received all the stuff and came the
question of wait a minute do we trust
plug in these things into systems either
because electrical problems or because
root kits and things like that and we
did previously run a couple of scans
with a low value system on our two
terabyte flash drive that we did a video
on so this is the trash Peter let me
walk you through this it's gonna be our
test bench for some upcoming projects
including one involving all kinds of LED
strips to see if those $50 kits like the
Gila plus or the BitFenix whatever it is
and the corsair RGB kits we're basically
trying to see can you just buy strips
for like a dollar from Aliexpress and
get the same quality and so we'll
that'll be interesting we'll be working
on that probably next week but anyway so
what we've got here this is an Andy PC
build it has an Athlon 3800 plus that's
an Athlon 64 which means it is fully
ready for 64-bit computing and the 3800
plus I believe was two point something
gigahertz I don't
2.4 off top my head and that was a 2004
part so I go back to 2004 3,800 plus
here for the CPU with four sticks of
memory by the way is that socketed one
of them is oh it is socketed he socked
it correctly it's just they're different
different sticks of memory so they're
not all for the same stick four sticks
of memory I'm not sure how much how to
ask them and we've got a GT 440 video
card which I recognize this this is an
Asus design GT 440 the probably the most
the highest value thin here is the K is
an n1 303 and the Corsair SP RGB fans
which we really only plugged in so we
could see how they compare to other RGB
things that we've purchased for cheaper
a lot cheaper so as you see they're
functional got lotsa LED strips we have
I think three different types of LED
strips in here we'll be testing those
out to see how they perform there's an
appeal power supply of sorts it has two
fans in one of them for intake and of
course one for exhaust because you can't
just have one fan in a power supply and
it even has a speed control on the back
so that's that's pretty high-end stuff
now one thing that I know you're
probably looking at and saying wait a
minute that's not a stock part I know
what you're thinking it's the CPU cooler
that is actually from a phenom 2 so you
are correct that is a very high-end
upgrade from what probably came with the
Athlon 3800 plus haha so this is our
trash peter it is a garbage test bench
and should be pretty fun for testing
things that are that don't require
high-end hardware
oh I you know and I should mention
operating system it's got Windows Vista
on it Thank You Patrick for that
surprise Windows Vista and there's an
NZXT century I don't know mx2 or
whatever it was ages ago they sent us
three views many years ago as stuffed
back in here somewhere so that we can
control other LED or
fan controls I believe it's therefore on
with an LED control it so we've got a
lot of work to do
LED PCI card in the back here is a PCI
is it actually PCI no this is an
expansion card that goes into an
expansion slot so that's pretty sweet I
kind of feel like that's gonna blow if
to use or something but yeah keep an eye
out for that content I hope everyone has
it these in April first because
apparently that's the thing we celebrate
in this industry if you look at the
likes of course they're Nvidia fractal I
don't know if fractals was actually a
real thing or if tech report just made
that case look up fractal furry case
you'll see what I mean thanks for
watching and subscribe for more we've
got news videos for you tomorrow and we
have a whole lot of in-depth benchmarks
coming up this week some stuff with VR
lots of stuff with Rison and likely some
10 a DT ia IB partner cards that's all
next week so stay tuned for that thanks
for watching I'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
