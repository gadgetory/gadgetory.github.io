recap at the end of what has been and
will continue to be the busiest week of
our careers here we've been working on
some Andy stuff lately as everyone knows
Andy is also dropping the prices of Navi
already so super has had its impact on
AMD before
Navi even came out horizon 3000 series
of course has been in the news a lot
lately and will be launching on tomorrow
when this video goes live said B Sunday
July 7th unless we upload earlier there
was a power outage in Japan that
resulted in the loss of a lot of NAND
game consoles dodging some price hikes
which is a good thing and some reports
on Sampson and Nvidia partnering up
along with other things but mostly are
focusing on some preliminary Rison and
Navi discussion before that this video
is brought to you by the EVGA gtx 1660
XC black video card EVGA gtx 1660 XC
black uses a fat heatsink to allow the
card to run at lower noise levels for
longer capable of sinking more heat
before the fan kicks in and also has a
day one game ready drivers for game
launches the 1660 XC black is short and
compact for installations a small
form-factor PC builds but if you need
one that isn't extra thick it's also
accompanied by a dual fan counterpart
with a thinner heatsink for standard
dual slot support learn more at the
links in the description below
quick Jeon reminder the GN toolkits are
on store documents Nexus dotnet so if
you've wanted one there up there we
still have a couple of the numbered ones
by the way we held a few just because
the way the shipping logistics worked so
you might be able to still get one if
you pick one of the sign ones up moving
on to AMD price drops so Navi the four
150 dollar 5700 XT the original price
that will now be $400 bringing it down
more on par with the 2060 super and a
hundred dollars below the 2070 super
rather than fifty dollars below it the
5709 XT and the often calls the XL is
$350 now instead of 400 and then the
anniversary edition the XT 50 is coming
down to four hundred and fifty dollars
instead of five hundred dollars for
basically the bin
version of the 5700 XT so those are the
new prices they're $50 slower each and
based on what we've seen on wine because
we we can't we can't comment on anything
yet until reviews go live but based on
what you've probably seen on the
Internet's these price drops were more
or less necessary at this point because
super did actually force a in these hand
it would put an D in a tough position
so it's interesting it's it's
interesting specifically because if AMD
had come out with these $50 lower prices
the situation would look different it
would look more like AMD forced Nvidia's
hand into creating super and bringing
down the relative performance versus the
price or the relative price whereas the
performance I should say but instead
because and the allowance its price is
first and Vidya came to market now in
AMD before even launching its product is
dropping the prices it makes it look
like Nvidia is the one big competition
to the market and bringing down the
prices so it's an interesting play if
only from a PR standpoint where AMD has
now put itself in a position where it
looks like it's on the defensive it's
it's backpedaling it's almost like an
admission of our products not that good
like it's they they looked at the super
forints and then 100 yes okay well guess
we gotta drop the prices so purely from
a PR and a visual standpoint doesn't
look great but the fact that prices came
down at all are obviously good
regardless of performance so we'll be
looking at that more one could assume on
release day but yeah anyway moving on
rise in 3000 and Navi reviews are in
progress for just about everyone in the
industry at this point you've probably
seen teasers from some people and I will
note that this has been probably the
most difficult week in my professional
career working at cameras and axes and
running it because basically to give you
an idea AMD is launching something to
the tune of
maybe eight CPU skews on Sunday plus
they've got ap use those are mixed in
there too they've got the two GPUs and
then Nvidia just had two GPUs the same
week and so the end result is that
Patrick and I have been working shifts
so he'll do like eight to ten hours and
I'll do the rest of the hours in the day
and that allows us to cover the whole
day so we have test benches running
literally 24/7 at this point and he and
I have been managing multiple of them
across a 24 hour period every single day
for about a week now and he's been doing
more hours I've been sleeping at the
office so we're getting the reviews done
there's a lot of them and it's an insane
so to give you an idea of just how
difficult this review cycle has been and
videos launch for us we weren't really
expecting before na'vi we're expecting
an afternoon Abbey and because of that
we ended up with in a situation we're
probably publishing like a month's worth
of silicon component reviews in a day
maybe a day and a half depending anyway
yeah that's what we've been working on
but the navvy price drops are the big
news item for the show $50 off of each
one is the summary and it it is an
interesting optics position for Andy to
be in Japan power outages so six
exabytes of NAND have been lost WD and
Toshiba suspending production as a
result of these power outages an
unexpected power outage in the youkai
Ichi region of Japan has affected
facilities operated jointly by Western
Digital and Toshiba memory the power
outage lasting roughly 13 minutes
happened on June 15th and has forced
Western Digital and Toshiba to partially
suspend operations operations are
expected to resume as normal by mid-july
according to Western Digital assessment
of the incident at least six exabytes of
NAND will be lost the quote the company
currently expects the incident will
result in a reduction of Western Digital
Flash way for availability of
approximately six exabytes the majority
of which is expected to be contained in
the first quarter of fiscal year 2020
that was in a Western Digital press
release
so Sheba didn't disclose how much of its
own and was affected but some estimates
pegged the number to around nine
exabytes revenue and profit loss aside
trend force points out how this will
impact client confidence in the
company's quote a fallout to that
Toshiba and Western Digital can expect
is some loss of confidence from their
downstream clients the reliability of
their production lines is now under
doubt as the base is not resuming normal
operation as quickly as can be
reasonably expected for a leading edge
semiconductor plant and that's on trend
forces right up andy filed a new patent
On June 27th entitled quote texture
processor based ray tracing acceleration
method and system and quote the patents
abstract states the system includes a
shader texture processor and cache which
are interconnected the texture processor
includes a texture address unit a
texture cache processor a filter
pipeline unit and a Ray intersection
engine the shader sends a texture
instruction which contains ray data and
a pointer to a bounded volume hierarchy
or PVH node to the texture address unit
the texture cache processor uses an
address provided by the texture address
unit to fetch BVH node data from the
cache the Ray intersection engine
performs ray bvh node type intersection
testing using the rate data and the BVH
node data the intersection testing
results and indications for BBH
traversal are returned to the shader via
a texture data path or data return path
the shader reviews the intersection
results and the indications to decide
how to traverse the next BVH node and
video uses BVH traversal and Ray
intersection test for its own rate race
and implementation but also has some
added denoising features and scheduling
and a bit different hardware Nvidia
shaders launcher ray probe with RT cores
fetching and decoding while performing
ray or tray and triangle intersection
testing and the appears to be
engineering a fixed function solution
for rate intersections the technology is
details as well in the patent
application if you're curious to learn
more but that's about all we have right
now we've been talking about the tariffs
price increases with especially US
imports lately because that does affect
the wider industry and how you can
expect a lot of computer products to go
up in price if they haven't already some
of the computer
cases have already gone off about 18% in
price as a result of the tariffs which
isn't even a one-to-one increase they're
taking a bit of a loss on margin on that
the new information the updated news is
that the most recently proposed 300
billion dollar tariff proposal in
addition to the existing tariffs has
been suspended for now of the existing
tariffs remain unaffected those those
would include ones that impact for
example case pricing power supply
pricing GP prior video card prices and I
should say all of that stuff that's
still in effect it's just that there's
the new proposal the 300 billion dollar
extra tariff has been suspended Huawei
was placed on a so called entity list
and saddled with a trade black listing
that has seen most major US tech
suppliers being forced to retract their
business with the company without access
to u.s. IP and chip technology as well
as operating systems like Android
Huawei's business in the western part of
the world is uncertain to say the least
however the Bureau of Industry and
security granted companies a special
license to continue supply in Huawei
although it was intended to be temporary
Intel and Microsoft have also pledged to
support Huawei devices with critical
security updates for the foreseeable
future something we talked about last
week just exactly how much the u.s. is
relaxing sanctions against Huawei is
unclear at this point the u.s. stated
any network equipment affecting national
security wouldn't be sold and anything
5g related is almost certainly off the
table and holding off additional tariffs
game consoles are able to avoid a
significant price hike when the 300
billion dollar tariff proposal was
announced the one that would affect
electronics like consoles console makers
were very quick to issue a joint
statement all working together not
something you see ever warning of how
they could affect consumers the tariffs
that is and the industry alike for now
it seems like the situation between the
US and Chinese economies has at least
stopped advancing with the tariffs we'll
see how it progresses but the major news
item that we care about here on this
channel being technology related is that
the tariffs that were recently proposed
that Nintendo Sony and Microsoft joined
together to oppose have been suspended
so those concerns of the price hikes on
consoles and other electronics they're
all affected those those prices will not
be going up for import right now for at
least for the foreseeable future the
next one is a report on Samsung and its
manufacturing the Korea Herald is
reporting that and video will partner
with Samsung for its 7 nanometre ampere
GPUs expected sometime in 2023 Ford
cites Korea leader yoo jung joon as
confirming the switch from TSMC in a
statement to tom's hardware Nvidia
neither confirmed nor denied the
veracity of the report but we do not
comment on rumors or speculation we
already used both the SMC and Samsung
and qualify each of them for every
process node we can't comment in any
further detail on future plans but both
remain terrific partners and that
phrasing is so familiar to us that we
could probably pinpoint the exact person
that Nvidia who wrote it that's a very
common response we don't comment on
rumors or speculation so anyway the
reports interesting the reports last
month that serviced on Samsung sure that
Samsung was working too aggressively
undercut TSMC with seven nanometer
process fabrication so that's been a big
news item as 7 nanometre has begun to
take the the forefront and new product a
PCIe for Gen 4 SSDs have been showing up
one terabyte as well starting at about
230 dollars and these horizon 3,000 and
updated am for platform with the x5 70
chipset will support PCIe generation 4
there'll be the first mainstream
platform basically a reference platform
for PCIe John 4 at this point which is
an interesting play a good place for AMD
to be with Gen 4 there at the front of
it and with that comes the first
consumer oriented PCIe gen 4 devices
including SSDs technically there's also
the navi side of things where those are
PCIe gen 4 enabled so there is actually
something on the GPU side you can't take
a Titan RT X for example and expect it
to have Gen 4 bandwidth by just plugging
it into a Gen 4 slot so it would kind of
make sense because the CPU ultimately
dictates Gen 4 support and then the
motherboard after that
but unfortunately the the GPU also has
to be compliant so Navi is the first of
the GPUs and then the SSDs are the first
that actually matter the GPUs frankly
Navi is not going to be fast enough for
Gen 4 to be relevant in any reasonable
use case that our audience would be
involved in so gaming production doesn't
matter for the most part Navi is just
not it doesn't push enough data down the
pipe for it to matter but for PCIe for
SSDs that it will matter Gen 4 actually
is significant if you're doing something
with those higher-end SSDs that is going
to be transaction intensive so the news
here is that there are two available for
order there's the sabre and rocket and
the corsair force MP 600 gigabyte has an
ARS model coming but it won't be
available at Ryan's launch of the two
available both used toshiba's 96 layer
TLC NAND and are based on five zones at
PS 50 16 a 16 controller currently the
only PCIe for SSD controller on the
market is Phi's on Z 16 controller both
say burn to end courts are offering
capacities of either 1 or 2 terabytes
and both offers similar performance by
the marketing text so we haven't tested
them and probably won't but hopefully
someone will pick up Alan Melvin tantos
testing regimen so sequential reads are
marketed at 5 gigabytes per second the
sequential writes 4 gigabytes per second
for 1 terabyte prices start at $230 for
the saber and rocket courses MP 600 will
start at $250 for 1 terabyte another
patent filing for AMD in this one this
one's really interesting - Andy filed
for a patent that outlines a
thermoelectric cooling solution for 3d
stacks memory this is becoming more
interesting as well because in towns
been talking about 3d stacking more of
its products going forward this was
something that was more or less proven
as doable with NAND and now it's moving
into other parts of the silicon industry
as well the patent describes a solution
for p-type and n-type semiconductors
using a an integrated Peltier effect for
cooling and the drawings associated with
the patent essentially illustrate
inserting a Peltier device between the
memory die and the lodge
Claire of a chip this patent makes sense
as Andy has been looking into embedding
memory onto processors for a while and
this is similar in some ways to what
Intel is doing with its Favreau's
technology something that we talked
about in about December so of last year
Silicon lottery will offer been to rise
in 730 800 X and 3900 exercise 9 chips
for the immediate future Andy is
continuing to gain some ground in the
enthusiast segments with well-known
binning and overclocking service
providers Silicon lottery offering
bender risin 3,000 chips Silicon Lottery
has updated its website with
placeholders for the r7 3700 x r7 3800 x
+ r9 3900 X and the 3950 acts according
to the website availability for the bins
chips is July 13th roughly a week after
isin three thousands July 7th launched a
quick side note here to the 39 50 X will
not be included among those that is
releasing later in the year I believe it
was September 4th at 1 risin 3,000 chips
will be using a soldered heat spreader
soldered IHS this time so we're not sure
if silicon lottery will be extending its
delayed service to the chips that is
something that the company also provides
technically you can get a bit of an
uplift in performance if you deal it a
soldered chip Intel AMD doesn't matter
and remove the indium which is kind of a
pain but you can buy a solvent to do it
look it's basically a liquid metal and
then you could apply liquid metal to it
and improve the thermal performance not
really worth it in our opinion generally
we haven't done this with rise in 3000
obviously but for past processors on
average it's not super worth D lidding
once it's already soldered that does
take out a lot of the issues but you
could still improve performance so we
don't know if they'll offer that but we
do know that they're bending them that's
it for this one subscribe to catch a lot
of reviews coming up make sure you check
back with us frequently on Sunday on
July 7th because we're posting a lot of
videos that day and they'll be a bit
staggered just so that the each video
has space to breathe and we'll post
stuff on the website as well alongside
of those videos but youtube is going to
be where it's at for the deeper parts of
our content
make sure you check back regularly on
Sunday and on Monday of this week so the
7th and the 8th for all of the coverage
because I don't we're not sure how much
will get pushed to your sub boxes if
we're publishing that many things that's
it for this one thank you for watching
