hardware news recap to the past week the
last couple days have been very heavy in
the Vega Department we've got Vega Fe
right here review just went live so if
you haven't seen it check that out
so Vega dominates a lot of the news
cycle for the past couple days there
aren't too many other topics but there
are some important ones for example the
rise in proline from AMD and then an on
AMD news there's also a new Western
Digital 96 layer NAND coming out and
then Toshiba's new 4-bit Purcell flash
we'll be talking about those along with
some product launches for this week's
recap before that this coverage is
brought to you by the core G 21
enclosure from thermal take a $70 case
with two four millimeters thick tempered
glass side panels mesh ventilation in
the front for breathability a rarity in
cases these days and a power supply
shroud with top mounted SSD sled learn
more at the link in the description
below before getting started a couple of
notes about the Vega EFI review the
written review had a couple of extra
lines in the conclusion that were
important and I wanted to bring them up
in video form as well for the video
audience first of all for as stated in
both forms of review Vega EFI is not the
best tool to try and extrapolate
performance of RX Vega there are too
many variables still it's best as I
stated in the video review to just have
no expectations for rx Vega wait for it
to launch and then we'll see if it's
surprising or not at that time but
ideally no expectations going into it
for example there are still a lot of
comments out there that are like RX Vega
is going to be 30 to 40 percent faster
it's just just maybe let's temper those
a little bit so that there's not a big
wave of disappointment because people
have hype themselves up really based on
no official information other than kind
of speculation rumors and things like
that so just a note on that again we'll
look at our x-ray go when it's time to
do so but until that point no no real
point in trying to speculate how it will
perform other notes on Vega F e again it
is in need of some driver updates with
blender I wanted to point this out so
blender we had issues with it crashing
initially and the crashes were not the
desktop it was just it was a system
pain and then either a blue screen or
just a black screen basically a shutdown
event where you have to do a cold do
from that point and we were able to
somewhat work that out by working with
the blender foundation one of their
cycles coders through reddit messaging
and kind of work it out get it working
on time for the review got a render done
the numbers are in so we have all the
data but it still seems a little bit
buggy in our work with it and it's
really I really can't say if it's
blender or if it's drivers at this point
because a system hain could be a kernel
event or a crash could be a blender
event it's it's really hard to say right
now but we're still having some issues
so the point being that as stated in the
review the blender testing could improve
going forward at least instability we're
not sure about performance performance
could very well be the same but there
are a lot of different things that you
can render and with some specific types
of rendering processes within blender
for example the tracing transparent
shadows and working with that fur on one
of the monkeys that we render could be
causing a challenge for Vega
specifically and that might be leading
to a kernel level crash or system hain
so we're still looking into that still
talking with the blender foundation
hopefully AMD will we'll be able to
provide some official information as
well at some point once they've gotten a
chance to look at it on their end it is
a long weekend though but that's kind of
updates on all that stuff otherwise we
do have initial numbers for you in the
review if you're curious for more about
blender but hopefully we can do a lot
more with it soon once it's more stable
so next topic the first real topic for
the last week of hardware news micron is
a set to discontinue the XR brand
probably haven't heard Lexar too much
lately but it's been in the industry a
while and micron owns it and they're
looking to discontinue it Lexar was
bought from cirrus logic in 1996 and
subsequently acquired by micron in 2006
the discontinuation of Lexar is part of
micron strategy to increase quote
opportunities and higher value markets
and channels or said in another way
focus on products with higher profit
margins micron has vowed to support
existing LexArts
during the transition but it looks like
the company will be going away also
interesting Toshiba has started
producing qlc or quad level cell 3 diene
and chips these will have 16 charge
levels so that doubles what a 3 bit PLC
module would have or NAND flash and many
news outlets are saying that this is an
alternative coming forward for TLC for
dust cob use it's still a bit early to
say if that's actually going to be the
case but either way qlc is in production
and research from Toshiba at this time
and the biggest thing to look out for
will be more limited PE cycles or
program arrays cycles which are
estimated to be between 100 and 150
quite a bit lower than what we've seen
with mlc for instance moreover qlc will
require an advanced controller different
monitoring and error correction
initially Toshiba sat qlc will focus on
worm or write once read many tasks the
new flash dies hold 768 Giga bits or 96
gigabytes and a 64 layer stack so 1/16 I
stack could offer 1.5 terabytes of
storage toshiba has revealed plans for
qlc SSDs offering 100 terabytes of data
capacity and this tags along with really
everything else we already know about
flash which is as you as you add more
layers to the cell or more levels to
sell and you increase the charge level
you lose endurance but you gain capacity
at a lower cost hence the lower PE
cycles but the greater endurance again
looking at a 16 die stack being 1.5
terabytes or thereabout
so there's no word on endurance right
now no real word on performance either
in terms of the speeds but for the time
being the new flash will probably be
aimed at data center and enterprise
where again they are writing one time
and reading a whole lot so back up
basically or just very rarely ever
programmed and erased more than a couple
times so she was planning to give us
more information at the next flash
memory summit or MMS in August of this
year Western Digital alongside Toshiba
as part of their joint venture announced
BICS for NAND or bit costs scaling that
NAND at slash technology with new chips
using
96 layers Western Digital noon and will
include several configuration capacities
and we'll use TLC and qlc architectures
speaking of presently 96 layers is the
largest layer count in the industry and
WD plans to offer components that are
both TLC and qlc based with capacities
ranging from 256 gigabytes to one
terabyte as previously stated it's
reasonable to expect that the qlc
configs will be suited for data center
and enterprise applications more so than
consumer WD plans to sample select 96
layer B ICS for dyes by the second half
of this year with mass production slated
for 2018 like Toshiba Western Digital
plans to offer more information also at
flash memory summit 2017 in August with
Vega being the focus lately it feels
like it's been a long time since risin
came out but that's actually not the
case Rison pro is slated to be the next
align that Andy is pushing and this will
introduce six new SKUs and the risin
family they are business targeted as
indicated by the pro moniker and the
biggest changes here are advanced
security measures so they're for again
business is not something that a
consumer would make use of and then a
different hypervisor setup better
manageability for enterprise and b2b
type work reliability and extended
warranty and then what what AMD says is
improved silicon quality we don't really
have any actual measurements of that or
what exactly that means but basically it
sounds like more hand selected or at
least semi binned or tested chips for
risin Pro Rison Pro is expected to start
rolling out in fall and it looks like
the main chips of note that we should be
interested in are probably the rise in
three units because we haven't actually
seen those on the desktop side yet so
for risin three they've got risin three
Pro 1,300 announced and risin three at
Pro 1200 announced following the 1,500
1,400 of risin 5 and those are both for
core 4 thread parts they boost 2 for the
1200 3 point 4 gigahertz and for the
1300 unit they boost it boosts to 3.7
gigahertz with the rest of the units
being familiar so Rison pro 17
X is 8 core 16 threads as we know from
the 1700 X non-pro still at 3.5 3.7
gigahertz so familiar clock speed risin
pros 1700 3 gigahertz and 3.7 gigahertz
boost also 8 cores 16 threads and then
risin 5 is familiar here as well so all
the parts will be 65 watts except the
1700 X which remains 95 watts as the
non-pro unit does moving into product
launches that were announced in the past
week one of the big ones is intel's 545
series SSDs these are the first 64 layer
PLC 3d NAND SSDs coming to market and
they use a floating gate architecture
the Intel 545 series will use an SMI
controller or silicon motion and that's
the SM 2259 for the controller it looks
like it will be a 2.5 inch form factor
for SATA but m dot 2 variants are
expected to exist as well the Intel 545
s will launch in a 512 gigabyte capacity
for $180 and the drive will come with a
five-year warranty finally getting into
peripherals there are a couple of new
Mike's coming out MSI's got a new clutch
gaming mouse and Thermaltake has the
Nemesis switch these follows the biggest
Mouse launches of the year from a
Logitech coarser and Razer with a
Logitech using a magnetic resonance
charging surface that goes with the new
G 903 or whatever it's called that
follows the G 900 series that was one of
the biggest ones now for cheaper options
there's a TT eSports nemesis switch it's
called which is supposedly a $50 cheap
RGB entry-level MOBA and MMO Mouse
focusing on macros and switches for the
most part uses a BMW 3360 sensor and
that tops out at 12,000 dpi of course
that's not the only measurement you also
care about things like IPs but the mouse
uses a pretty standard 50 million click
on Ron switch they're used in a lot of
things these days really second to the
20 million switches in popularity for
mice and they have 12 programmable
buttons on the mouse with 5 profiles the
interesting thing is that although there
are 12 switches on the Thermaltake
nemesis switch Mouse they have four that
are sort of hidden within the
so these switches can be basically
rolled into place while eight are moved
round in the nice body and we'll have
some photos to show that off for you but
the other mouse the MSI clutch Gaming
Mouse is the clutch GM 60 it follows a
line that MSI already launched a Maasai
not necessarily known for peripherals
really at all but everyone has to make
them now so they're using a PMW 33:30
sensor and there's 10k dpi sensor and
its counterpart the GM 70 uses a pmw
3360 sensor both mice offer dpi stepping
and one hundred dpi increment and run a
1000 to 3000 Hertz polling rate no word
on price for the msi clutch mice but
they should be coming out in July where
thermal takes nemesis switch coming out
in quarter three of this year so that's
all for this news roundup as always you
can subscribe to catch more when we work
in order this card's throughout the week
and go to store doc gamers Nexus nice to
pick up a shirt like this one or
patreon.com/scishow nice to tell us that
directly thanks for watching I'll see
