the box tangles so this is an Intel CPU
versus an AMD cpu and the AMD CPU is
measuring that at a twenty one point six
which is a delta T over ambient of about
zero and the Intel CPU is measuring at
twenty one point six before getting to
that this content is brought to you by
the thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a three hundred
sixty millimeter radiator plus three 120
fans that are RGB illuminated if then
we'll take it ringing fans at that this
is a 4.5 done a stack pump which is one
of the faster pumps you can learn more
at the link in the description below so
as you can see when we get rid of the
heatsink that user last week was
actually correct heat sinks are
irrelevant when you get rid of the
heatsink and you just measure them out
of the box like a user would use them
just like this they are actually
completely identical in performance and
I think if we were to take a CPU cooler
just let that kind of sink the heat for
a second okay that should be enough yep
still 21.6 so they're completely
irrelevant
I apologize for last week I said
something about how CPU coolers were
actually very important to measuring
temperature for CPUs and how you can't
just disregard them but obviously this
test proves if it's 21.6 now delta T
over ambience of zero C and I take the
cooler off still 21.6 well I guess
there's no reason for the cooler
industry to exist anymore so sorry sorry
I knocked I didn't mean to put you out
of business
so that was our out of the box thermals
test that was requested by popular
demand last week you've now gotten it
you're welcome
welcome back to ask GN this is episode
61 I think we are going to be taking
questions from the comment section and
from our patreon discord you can leave
quite
in the comments below and I will dig
through all of your dank memes as well
as actual questions it gets harder every
week to find the ladder and you can also
post questions in our patreon discord if
you go to patreon.com/scishow is so
let's start with a question on streaming
and gaming or just streaming in general
this one was posted by otter wise in the
patreon discord and otherwise asks you
guys have a lot of content on gaming and
streaming but what kind of hardware
would be ideal for a dedicated streaming
machine this is a really good question
so most of our actually all of our
benchmarks at this point have been just
on a host system that games and streams
to use your twitch simultaneously or
records and clearly for those types of
workloads really it's just more chords
is more better for the host system
because as you burden it with gaming and
streaming tasks if your encoding and
doing encoding tasks on the CPU it's
just gonna get weighed down with
something like a fork or for example so
we know what to expect for the host
system if you're doing a standalone
streaming PC in some instances it might
come out to be potentially a little bit
cheaper the memory prices right now will
really screw everything up but basically
what I would do is just some r5 CPU that
can handle the encode no problem at all
you can buy the cheapest six core r5 you
could spend five minutes overclocking
it's a three point something gigahertz
maybe three point eight or nine I think
with 1600 work well for that and then
really you could if you if you don't go
too hard with the overclock you could
just use the stock cooler to keep cost
down further or throw some $25 cooler on
there like the thermaltake contact 12 or
the I don't really like the higher four
to twelve the thermaltake contact twelve
would be a better choice than the hyper
212 for that one but you throw something
like that together that's a really cheap
system get the cheapest memory you can
get that's within reason and throw a
light overclock on that as well
a couple hundred megahertz or something
slightly increase the mole
flyer and you'd be good to go then you
just need a capture card so I capture
machine like that it doesn't need to be
that powerful and you can either take
parts you have lying around or just buy
cheap r5 cheap board cheap memory and
let it do its work
the only thing to be careful of is if
you go with be 350 gets some kind of
cooling on the prm's if you do overclock
it but otherwise that's what I would do
and if you do that route for gaming and
streaming in theory the secondary
capture machine should resolve the lower
frame time performance where you get
spikes and frame time consistency during
streaming from the host system that
should be fixed by having an external
machine and also depending on what
you're doing it might be a little bit
cheaper or around the same cost so it
just comes down to do you have the space
to do it and this is also something
where you can salvage cases power
supplies all basically everything
because it's not like you're gonna be
gaming with it it's just gonna sit there
probably in a corner and then you can
grab something like either synergy which
they have they run ads with us right now
you've seen the ads most of you you can
run something like synergy so that you
can just use one keyboard and mouse to
interact with the host system that does
the gaming and a streaming system or you
could use that new Logitech keyboard and
mouse that we saw at PAX which has
Wireless and Bluetooth options and you
set it up for Bluetooth on one machine
and Wireless on the other and you just
toggle between them that would be a
software or a hardware solution to the
problem so then you can only have one
set of peripherals as well which would
be pretty nice next question is from
waffle who says I want to ask a question
that pertains to new motherboards like
the a C's crosshair hero six which come
with a IO headers but don't know how to
ask it it might go something like this
should we buy should we be using a IO
headers or not are there any performance
benefits if not what should we be
doing and should the consumers care if a
motherboard has an AI ou have header
what do you think I don't know if I
answered this one before but those
headers on motherboards are primarily
there for things like the motors so the
liquid cooler motors are generally
something like 8 pull as opposed to
4-pole on most fans so depending on how
they're set up and what motherboard it
is I don't know what the crosshair does
but they might have changed the math in
there so that it reads the RPM
accurately if you plug something like an
eight pole engine twenty seven or an
eight pole pump into some of the headers
on some of the motherboards like we saw
when we tested the engine 27 sometimes
those headers will read it as a four
pole motor and if it does what will
happen is you'll get two times the RPM
read out in BIOS as reality so it ends
in 27 it's been at 2500 rpm but our BIOS
was reporting 5000 which is enough to
take off your hand so clearly there's
there's a reason there just in terms of
making sure you have an accurate reading
of reality other than that it's there
are some different options on some of
the boards we've worked with where the
i/o headers will have different profiles
for their percent duty cycles for how
they're the pump behaves under different
conditions as opposed to a fan and I
think that pretty much is it there might
be one or two things I'm I'm not
familiar with because I've only really
used the i/o headers on the ACS boards
lately so if you know of differences
with the gigabyte board drama side
boards let me know in the comments
because I haven't really looked into
that beyond what I've just said next
question is from sir papa who says ask
Gian thoughts on testing cases with
water cooling alongside air cooling my
thought is that cases get bigger as
cases get bigger the air from the front
fans loses its speed and therefore
cooling performance do you think that an
would be an equaliser between big and
small cases therefore having purpose and
testing or would the work would become
through high the workload does become
pretty high a couple of thins to this
question it's a good one
so we did publish the age 500 peat
radiator placement guide after the
review which basically does this it also
tests the radiator in different mounting
locations to see which one's best but
first of all with regard to workload
becoming too high that age 500 Peter 88
replacement video I'm almost definitely
not going to make ROI on so you can see
why we won't want to do that for every
case review because we lose money on all
time the next thing is in terms of
thermal testing and cooling testing you
run into challenges where some cases
will support radiator mounts in
different positions than others
so it becomes a question of how do we
standardize this do we want to always
use it in the top position because
there's pretty much always gonna be one
or do we put it in the front position
and then you have a lot more variables
to deal with explaining to the viewers
or readers when you're talking our
performance because ideally you're not
doing what we did for the Aged 500 P and
testing the radiator in every slot
because it's just not I mean it's just
not sustainable as a business model but
if you test only one position there's a
chance of either the CPU is slightly
worse than it could be or the GP is
slightly worse than it could be because
based on where the cooler is one of
those components will cool better than
the other normally so that's a
consideration
another big consideration is that the
closed loop coolers are sort of big
equalizers in that as you start using
them to cool the CPU you lose some of
the resolution on the differences
between a really bad and a mid-range
case so it starts you'd start making
something like an Tek PA look somewhat
acceptable just simply because you're
using liquid to cool it and brute force
so you do lose some test resolution on
the differences between high-end or not
even high ends but mid-range and low-end
which is what we care about the most and
then other than that I mean yeah it's
basically it
down to how do you standardize placement
if a case doesn't support radiator
mounting in one spot where the previous
case did how do you reconcile that in
your testing and your review and your
notes because the performance is now
going to be contingent more on the
radiator location than on the case
design itself and then you have concerns
of obviously workload becoming too great
to make money off of the content because
you can't sustain an operation that
requires money to to continue if you are
spending more than you make
and finally it's just the the fact that
the CLC's do sometimes perform too well
in to the point where you can't see as
big of a problem with the truly bad
cases as you would otherwise and a lot
of the times the truly bad cases are
ones that would be paired with an air
cooler anyway so we wouldn't want to do
just liquid coolers because you lose
that resolution but doing both has its
own challenges a great question though
basically our solution to this is to try
and do stuff like the aged 500 Peter 88
replacement guide on a per case basis
with cases that people have clearly
expressed a lot of interest in so not
all of them but just stuff that we think
we could actually get the traffic on
like the H 500 P or something similar to
that next question is from Jonas or
Jonas Bjorklund who says follow-up
question to the radiator positioning
question you said that it is sub optimal
to have the tubes going up and not down
with a CLC I've heard this before but I
really don't get why this is the case
probably because of a lack of
understanding of how the inlet and
outlet to a radiator looks I watched
your video on ail coolers but as I
remember that particular detail wasn't
covered so we Vance I've answered this
one a few times over the last few years
but the very short of it is those a few
things but one of them if you haven't
seen our TL DR how liquid coolers work
watch that but as for liquid coolers and
orientation basically this comes back to
me saying mount with the tubes oriented
down not up so if you're mounting the
front of the case
see on the tubes down here even if it's
gonna look a little funny as opposed up
high
and that's just gravity it's because the
air in the tank will float to the top
and if the tubes are at the top they're
gonna be where those air pockets can
form and so what happens then is you can
get some gurgling and the pump every now
then when air is sucked through the
tubes because it's sitting at the top of
the tank and the radiator so as it gets
sucked through the tubes it gets pulled
through the pump and you got some
bubbling noises that people don't tend
to like theoretically there could be
some impact to longevity there as well
but I don't have I I mean we haven't
done any longevity tests like that but
theoretically there could be the main
concern that was just noise and then
after that longevity is a potential
concern that's the main reason you do it
that way though a big absolute no tell
with radiators is don't ever take
something like a hybrid card and mount
it with the radiator in the bottom of
the case with the tubes up because then
you're fighting gravity to a point where
as permeation occurs naturally over time
and you have less liquid in the loop
you're gonna have bigger air pockets
those will sit between the the barbs the
flanges and the tank and the radiator
and that'll cause issues with pulling
air through the loop and causing damage
in fact it's bad enough that EVGA is
hybrid installation guides that come in
the manual say not to install it that
way next question
Alex Coleman says Steve I've been
watching the thread Ripper review since
I want to get it for work 3d rendering
my question is why do you keep calling
it - blender rendering I know you guys
use blender to test performance but
that's not the point I'm trying to make
there are so many render engines out
there it might confuse newcomers to the
industry that it's only good for blender
wouldn't it be better when referring to
3d rendering performance or video
encoding performance to call it like
that instead of blender rendering or
premiere rendering you don't call
streaming performance OBS or xsplit
performance so as I addressed in this
was from discord and discord streaming
performance we don't call OBS or xsplit
because they're irrelevant to the
equation it's just
it's they're just rapping h.264 encoding
and then you apply some settings to it
so all you need to know is those
settings it kind of matters like we do
actually say we use OBS for this but I
don't say OBS encoding I say h.264
encoding as for the actual question we
call it blender rendering or premiere
rendering because we don't test the
other applications so I can't in good
faith just say rendering and think that
it will apply equally to all
applications because it doesn't premiere
is a great example premiere if you've
ever worked with it on a scale like we
do or greater you know how much fun it
can be to work with and how reliable it
is and premiere has very specific and
vigilia behaviors with rendering so for
us to say a cpu renders videos X percent
better than another CPU would be
disingenuous if our only data point is
Adobe Premiere because Adobe Premiere
has its own unique and complex behaviors
that even we don't fully understand so
and most other people for that matter so
you can't really just say you can't take
Adobe Premiere data for rendering videos
and say CPU a renders videos 5% faster
than CPU B so if you're using Sony Vegas
or a DaVinci Resolve I'd look up the
second one or something like that
they're gonna have way different
performance than what we do with
Premiere and also it varies based on
video file and codec and things like
that so AVC HD 1080p 60 on one with
certain parameters for rendering in
terms of bitrate warps and color
correction scales things like that it
will render differently and perform
differently in Premiere than software B
so it is not accurate just to just call
it video rendering as for blender
rendering we use cycles the cycles
renderer in blender and we use specific
settings defined in blender on the per
project basis for what's how it's being
rendered how many samples what size
things like that and same thing there
we're not
Steen 3ds max we're not testing Maya so
I don't know how they perform they could
very well perform differently if they're
not using the same renderer then
performance could be different and we're
not gonna say 3d rendering if all we're
testing is blender so that's that's why
I say blender rendering and premiere
rendering because I tested blender and
premiere and there are a lot of
differences potentially between software
that we can't account for without
testing it as well so that should pretty
much answer that one last question for
this week actually it's not really a
question cookie
King gaming says on our knock to a
liquid versus air coolers video that we
just posted gamers Nexus stopped using
charts these results are not tested or
proven so basically this is fake content
if you call stupid charts content
disliked okay anyway thanks for watching
you can leave your comments below for
the next episode hopefully their
questions I don't want to encourage
things like the last comment mostly
because I'm gonna have an aneurysm if I
try to understand what it means he could
