coverage now at the inland booth
so they have a couple of cases for us
one is more practical and one is more of
a showpiece we'll start with the
showpiece the practical case is a
finalization of the a1 small form-factor
PC that we saw at copy Tech's around
June of last year so that's finally
beginning to enter production should be
pretty much the final design at this
point we'll look at that one there's
also the in one nine one five that we're
looking at here and we'll start with
that before that this video is brought
to you by thermal Grizzly makers of the
conductor hot liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee like temperatures Thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below so for the nine one
five I'll just get the flashy piece out
of the way immediately there's a button
that has a mechanical raised for the top
panel so this is something we haven't
seen a lot of this I the last time I can
remember seeing a mechanical top for a
case was like 2009 or 10 for some
Alienware case when I worked at Dell I
don't even know if it ever made it to
the market so that's probably about the
last time I saw it so yeah it's just a
it's a button press raises lowers
automatically in the back there's a belt
drive so it's a rubber belt drive just
like you'd see it's a smaller version of
what you'd see for any other drive belt
and there's a motor of some kind back
here as well and it's just three
spindles with the belt wrapping around
it
push the button they spin and raise the
top the entire piece is one module so
it's semi modular and that if you wanted
to remove the top so that you can get a
radiator in there it's all one piece the
radiator secures to the chassis
rather than this top bit that raises and
lowers so they are somewhat isolated now
of course this is a showpiece it's not
really meant for consumer use but half
of in winds products are in that
category so nothing new for any of you
who've seen their stuff that doesn't
make it less cool to look at though so
yeah it's a I think an acrylic panel on
the top they've got tempered glass on
the side tempered glass on the other
side the other side is non-final so that
may change the design currently has in
logos all over it that's still kind of
in flux whether that's gonna be final or
not other specs for the case it does
have a power supply shroud and it's got
fan mounts that can be repurposed as SSD
sleds if you prefer in the bottom of the
case on top of the PSU shroud and then
the chassis wall for the motherboard
tray is presently not final either but
it's kind of looking like this is what
its gonna be so a couple more mounting
options there and it can fit EI TX
motherboards if you prefer just kind of
as a side note for components if you're
interested there's an ek Phoenix
quick-release cooler in here so this is
a QDC valve from ek and means that you
can make a semi open-loop if you want it
to cool the GPU as well for example not
really related to the case but just kind
of a cool thing to show and it's got the
HyperX memory in there as well that we
showed previously if you want to check
that out so that's the main feature for
the case we will move on to the a1 next
a bit more practical more affordable for
consumer but other than that there's one
more thing to point out I guess so this
is all aluminum it does have a lot of
space in front of the fans that's just
kind of empty space that's always good
to have static air just sitting there
ready to be used
the idea is you would do a full custom
loop anyway so not that relevant but the
intake port is basically just on the
bottom for all of the intake for the
front the back panel is about the same
design with a bunch of ventilation holes
in it and then they're both aluminum
panels is actually a 100% of aluminum
for the most part for the case and oh
yeah also the top panel when you shut
down the system it will actually stay
open for about 10 seconds before
shutting again so there's some time for
the warm air to get away from the
radiators in the top so let's take it
over to the a1 case now and look at the
small form-factor option now that's been
finalized so this one is more practical
the previous case the 911 five I don't
even have a prize for which should
pretty much tell you where it's gonna
land it's one of those if you have to
ask maybe not for you the this one
though this is the a1 it's the final
version of what we saw many months ago
and it's a small form-factor case it
fits Mini ITX motherboards in terms of
course specs you can see that there is
kind of an acrylic side skirt here at
the bottom there's a marginal amount of
breathing room underneath
and that gives some level of access
although not much but enough to the fans
for pulling in some air because there
are actually two fans mounted in the
bottom here they are 120 millimeter fans
they have them set up as in taking this
booth both of them basically push air
straight into the GPU so GB is gonna be
the heaviest component in the system as
far as cooling goes there's also options
to mount a 120 rear exhaust fan in this
instance and then 120 side fan which you
can configure however you want if you
have a cooling issue for your CPU you
just throw in a side intake and that
should pretty much circulate the air in
the side out the back and then the video
card just receives the air directly into
it video card pushes the air around the
case out of the heatsink as usual so
other features on it it's got a I think
this might just be an acrylic side
acrylic side that has push-button pins
to mount to it the power supply is
included so that's mounted top front of
the case and the PSU is a 600 watt power
supply 80 plus bronze it is in one
branded I don't know the supplier but
that's included and I guess the primary
reasoning for that was because it's a
mini ITX case so they want to make sure
they eliminate one compatibility
concerns with the larger ATX power
supplies because it does fit standard
ATX but not the big ones and then -
because installing Barriss wise into
small case is kind of sucks so they do
that for you
but yeah that's that's most of it
there's a Qi charger on the top acrylic
top acrylic side skirts acrylic pretty
much everywhere and then ventilated
steel side panel so that is the in win a
1 case and I think that wraps up in wins
