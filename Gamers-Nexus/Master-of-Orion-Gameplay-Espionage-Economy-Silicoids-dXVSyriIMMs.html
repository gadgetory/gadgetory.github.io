nexus dotnet and we are joined by the
wargaming team to talk about Master of
Orion which many of you are familiar
with as a Forex game from 20 years ago
now so it's got some history before
getting to that all this coverage is
brought to you by cyberpowerpc who are
awarded the reader's choice for best
gaming desktop pc by PC Magazine so
let's let's get start on the newest
stuff here so master but Ryan has this
whole espionage and economic victory
element where do you want to start today
well I can tell you that we've been in
early access for a couple of months now
and today we're launching early access 3
first which brings us to be feature
complete for our races and the rest of
the features in the product right so
we're super excited to bring that that
brings us to more races we've got the
DAR locks who are all about espionage
which is one of the features that we
brought with them and we've got the
silicones that have come into this so
that's all of the 10 original races from
Master of Orion one which is really cool
for us we've also got the collector
edition which offers the Terrans voiced
by Robert Englund which is really sweet
they're they're evil humans and they
live up to it alright so that's very
cool so the Espionage mechanic is
something that was really impactful in
the early games and we wanted to do
justice with and we knew that we could
tie that with this race the DAR locks
they're shapeshifters they have stealth
ships they have different technologies
like it's a very different playthrough
and so within master of Orion's
espionage system you can revolt planets
you can steal technologies you can cause
famine you can stop research from being
happening there's lots of really cool
things to do with espionage it creates a
very different gameplay experience which
which also happens with the silicones
because they don't need food they're
just huge rock things right and it
they're done really well they look
really cool they're compelling they're
scary and right now they're crushing so
there's a there's a couple bigger name
voice actors in here give us alan tudyk
yeah we've got alan tudyk he's voiced
one of the characters for us mark hamill
john de lancie robert englund and of
color of course nolan north right
that it got to have him so we've got
some really cool stuff going on very
cool and then on the economic victory
side so what'swhat's there that people
should know about right so that's our
fifth victory condition so this one is
really about kind of playing a
non-aggressive playthrough right if you
want to win it without crushing
everything and you want to win it
without being super diplomatic like the
humans and John delancey's character is
really good at this is a really cool
different playthrough based on economics
right so you've got to own the GDP and
you've got to own the shares in the
market we've got independent planets
that we brought in for this release and
those are like non spacefaring races
that you can make relationships with and
you can buy and sell stocks and all
sorts of different things so it creates
another victory condition which brings
us to 5 and it allows people to have a
different gameplay experience and the
the GDP and the stock so you have to
hold a certain percentage for 10 turns
right so you got to hold 51% of both for
10 turns which sounds easy but it isn't
it's very difficult because you have
people like me will just buy as many
stocks as possible and not sell them so
it gets very interesting and quick so
one thing here I was just reminded of
with the spine side of things there was
a spy tree we looked at what were some
of the different approaches the spine
that we're available well one of theirs
there's four different paths right so
you can deal with technology you can
deal with the resources you can deal
with the agriculture agronomy and you
can deal with the revolts in the
diplomatic part right so one of the most
fun things for me is to be able to ruin
people's diplomatic relationships and
then send their world into total chaos
and revolt show up with my ships and
call it mine right so that's a very fun
mechanic sounds cool so more information
on Master of Orion in the link in the
description below this is the early
access 3 yeah and you can check that out
on Steam yep it's on Steam and good old
games very cool so more information
below as always thank you for watching
