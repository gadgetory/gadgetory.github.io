we're talking about GTA 5 settings this
is a settings optimization guide I wrote
the full article links in the
description below it's been very popular
so far so I highly recommend checking
out the article for more depth than you
will get here but I'll give you an
overview with some visuals to emphasize
the points that I was making in that
article so GTA has a lot of graphics
settings it's got the usual anti
aliasing anisotropic filtering it has
some sort of newer things they've been
around for a while we don't normally see
tessellation in games as a setting so
that is one of them and it's also got
some more advanced settings like
distance scaling population variety and
things like that and I've discussed some
of these in the past in other YouTube
videos but we're going to go into more
depth here so this guide benchmarks a
lot of these settings not a 100% of them
because that is an insane amount of work
but we did spend a couple of days
benchmarking at most of these settings
to determine what you can tweak to
enhance your GPS performance so this is
entirely a graphics card optimization
guide as it pertains to grand theft auto
and by following these steps hopefully
you can tweak a couple settings to get
the performance gains needed a couple
FPS here and there to enhance your
playability to a point that it's more
fluid and closer to 60fps i've ordered
these from most critical to least
critical or negligible so following each
of these in step will give you the
greatest immediate gains and performance
the first is multi sample anti-aliasing
or MSA a and this has been around for a
very long time it is an anti-aliasing
technology that smooths out edges at its
simplest top level overview and it does
this by taking color samples of each
pixel equal to the count of MSA a that
you've set so if you have 4x
msaa it takes four color samples per
pixel and that would be one on each
quadrant of the pixel effectively and it
looks at those samples then determines
what color the taxol or the pixel or
whatever should be such that it looks
the most blended with the background to
reduce the jagged edges appearance that
we get in a lot of objects a good
example of this would be to look at a
blade of grass or a fence with chain
links or even your character in the
mirrors in Grand Theft Auto 5 if you
find a mirror
a house that has a big interaction with
MSAA but MSAA has a massive impact on
FPS and it is one of the first things
you should limit or disable if you're
having trouble running the game I know a
lot of people really like it in Grand
Theft Auto because it is implemented
very well for msaa
but it is also a huge hit to perform
it's about 20 fps and some of our tests
it was closer to 10:15 at 4k tests but
when you're talking 46 or so vs. 30s
that's a big gap in performance and it
needs to just be disabled for the best
output of frame rates post effects
quality is the next one these are
post-processing effects that are applied
effectively as filters on the screen for
things like bloom which is something
that you'll see in high heat situations
or with the Sun setting and rising
there's also high dynamic range lighting
which effects the the coloring and the
dynamism of the light and then there are
depth of field and motion blur settings
which are enabled with higher post
effect settings in the game we found
about a 6 FPS performance gain by going
down one tick in post effects which is a
pretty big gain and if you go down more
than one tick you'll get more
performance output gained as seen in
this chart but if you want just a small
gain without sacrificing too much in
terms of visuals because we do have to
make a little bit of sacrifice to play
GTA 5 with our video cards I mean I have
to do it with a tight net so it's really
not a big deal it's actually great news
that means the game will scale better so
if you want to get a quick couple FPS
gain drop it from the max setting to one
step below that and then you can get
even more if you have to by going yet
another step after that that's a field
does have a fairly noticeable impact on
performance depth of field is actually a
true filter that is applied to the game
and this is something that's in a couple
of other games Unreal Tournament the new
one included DOF is basically a layering
system and this exists in the
photography world it's the exact same
there if you're familiar with that if
you have a closer up object I have a CPU
cooler this is close up to me if I have
my in-game camera sort of focused on
this everything in the background
including the camera will become more
blur
with different layers of depth so it's
effectively levelling the depth based
upon distance so that would mean the
wall very far in the back is really
blurry cameras a little blurry and then
this immediate stuff is in focus
including the CPU cooler
so that's depth of field you can turn
that on or disable it depending on if
you like it or not it is a filter so it
does impact your performance pretty
heavily grass has yet another massive
impact but it is a situational impact so
depend on where your benchmarking the
game you might not actually notice this
at first this is a problem we ran into
when we were benchmarking the game in
order to see the impact of grass
settings you need to be in a location
like a hillside where there's a lot of
grass being in the city where there's
cut grass doesn't work because it
doesn't spawn there so the grass
settings effectively dictate whether
strands of grass spawn and then those
have an animation they move around
basically in the wind I don't think it's
dynamic with actual wind I think it's
just a repeated animation of some kind
but I'm not 100% sure on that either way
it is very draining on the GPU we saw a
performance hits up to 50% where we go
from 60 to 30 FPS in some instances of
the Titan X and the benchmark sort of
emphasizes that point so if you want an
immediate gain and performance in the
situations where you are on a hillside
if you're like why is my phone so great
in the city and dies on the mountains
then this is the setting to drop
immediately I would really recommend
considering just going up down to high
you can also go down to normal it looks
pretty bad but it's it's acceptable in
exchange for the performance gain
because grass is really one of those
settings that's not too critical to
getting played shaders are the most
notable at greater distances this is
something that has a high impact on your
performance the previous two were severe
and critical so with shaders if you're
looking at things like mountainsides in
the distance you'll see shading
techniques applied to the mountain to
the hills where there's some diffusion
of shadows across the surface where you
see deformation of terrain so this is
something that's fairly important to
create a real-world scenario as closely
as possible in the terms of lighting but
it does have a big performance hit in
fact it's about 12 FPS from the max
setting to the lowest and
you can gain a very quick four FPS in
our scenario I should heavily emphasize
by moving from very high to high so it
is one of those settings you look at
first to change because you can drop
from very high to high not have a huge
in game visual impact but have a
noticeable for FPS performance
improvement in our test case shadows are
different from shaders these are seen
best by looking at objects people things
like that in game and paying close
attention to the shadows at varying
distances from them in this scenario you
can look at the two characters here on
normal settings the shadows are more
pixelated and jagged and on the higher
settings they're more blurred and
natural and also you'll notice the
shadows continue up to the feet of the
characters in these games when you have
higher settings whereas with lower
settings they stop short so this is
where you see the difference there are
diminishing returns in our testing
between normal and high settings for
shadows so we don't really recommend
going as low as normal because there's
very little gain in performance but
there's a fairly big gain in performance
by moving from ultra to very high it's a
couple FPS and that's definitely
worthwhile if you really need if you
have PSID puter your game reflection
quality impacts puddles mirrors windows
things like that and it's really just as
the name says it's how good reflections
look in their natural environments like
in a car window so by lowering the
setting you lose some of that but it is
one of those very rarely noticed
elements when you're really immersed in
the game so if you do need a couple FPS
you can lower this by one tick and
you'll get get that couple FPS pretty
quickly particles quality we saw a 5 FPS
gain from very high to high so
definitely noteworthy and this includes
things like metal scraping if you've got
something scraping against the road that
impacts particles if you drive on dirt
and sand that will have a big impact on
particles and I actually can really kill
your performance more than we found on
these charts so lowering it would help
in those instances and it also impacts
smoke like from tire burnout or spinouts
and that's really all particle quality
does it is something that we recommend
tweaking in small amounts
you have performance problems
tessellation adds depth to services by
deforming the object in ways that make
it appear to have more depth when in
reality is still the original object for
the most part it'll split quads into
more tries and things like that if
you're getting technical but at a top
level one example of tessellation would
be to look at a flat two-dimensional
plane like a wall and that plane has to
have a texture like a brick applied to
it where the brick has a 3d appearance
in the real world but looks flat because
it's on a 2d surface in game
tessellation can deform the wall such
that the bricks now have an apparent
depth to them and this can impact your
visual immersion in the game because of
the nature of tessellating and object so
it is something we recommend enabling in
some form texture resolution and quality
is something I discussed in another
video you can see a quick example the
texture qualities here check the channel
for that video if you're curious in it
anisotropic filtering we generally
recommend it leaving at the max or very
high settings meaning 8 or 16 X because
it has effectively zero performance
impact on games anisotropic filtering is
not something that hits the GPU or
really even the CPU for the most part
and what it does is it'll help oblique
camera angles in displaying a more
realistic scenario for textures so you
can see here with the road it gets more
blurry as it gets further on the
distance with anisotropic filtering
you're effectively filtering the texture
application such that it has a more
trapezoidal application in this instance
where the road is going off to a
vanishing point
so because the the camera angle is
aligned with the road in this way that
you've got a vanishing point it doesn't
make sense to apply the texture as a
square on what is effectively a
triangular or trapezoidal surface so
that's what anisotropic filtering helps
with and we recommend leaving it at
higher settings there are more settings
like ambient occlusion which impacts how
light interacts with surfaces in the
game and these are things that we
discuss some of in the article linked to
the description below but we did skip
over a few of them like the Advanced
Settings it was just a time issue so if
there's something you're curious about
the answer is time
because we've sent a full week on GTA
content and it's very intensive and it
was a lot of work
check out the article for the benchmarks
for more information please on the side
of the page hit the new cards button to
look at the link to that article and to
look at our patreon page we're trying to
raise funding to do more of these things
so we can explore those advanced
settings in the future so that time is
less of a concern and thanks for
watching I will see you all next time
