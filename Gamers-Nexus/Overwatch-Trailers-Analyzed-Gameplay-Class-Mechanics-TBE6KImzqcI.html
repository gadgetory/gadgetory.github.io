nexus dotnet and today we're talking
about overwatch blizzards new action FPS
game it is a first-person shooter it is
very similar to tf2 in look and feel and
I think you'll figure that out as we go
what we were doing today is analyzing
the trailers there was a cinematic
trailer which has nothing to do with
gameplay at all it's just a generator
hype which is something blizzard is very
good at with trailers and don't let that
impact your opinion of the game you'll
want to watch the gameplay trailers
we've got here for you for that because
that is of course the thing that
actually matters overwatch currently
does not have a release date or a price
we imagine it as free to play because in
all the interviews what Blizzard has
consistently used the word quote-unquote
accessible which is code for free to
play and I think it's going to take a
model similar to maybe a hybrid of dota
and tf2 now speaking of dota this game
has the appearance of a mobo it's an FPS
but their individual characters for each
player so the teams are six versus six
there is a a unique character for each
of those six slots it is yet unclear if
players will be able to overlap within a
team or if each one will have to play
one of those different characters and if
it's the latter that would be more of a
mobile feel but we're not sure yet so
we're not going to speculate too hard on
that what we do know for sure is
everything about the classes in terms of
their abilities the gameplay and how the
game will play out as far as the classes
and how they interact with one another
so first of all over watch is set in a
quoting blizzard technologically
advanced highly stylized future it uses
a appearance that is somewhat similar to
the cartoon comic book-like cel-shading
like style of tf2 Wow basically every
game that's come out recently I'm not
going to comment on whether I like the
style or not that's up to you to decide
because it really doesn't matter what I
think it's just graphics and appearances
and aesthetics but that's what it looks
like overwatch is a group of elite units
they are heroes who are restoring peace
to the world naturally by killing one
another because that is how we restore
peace to earth is by killing everything
so
the emphasis here is on a sort of small
hint of twitch shooting but not too much
and accessibility which screams
free-to-play to me and the maps are each
based on the classes in the game so as
far as I am aware there should be 12
maps each one at least six anyway each
one being based on the unique units so
there are 12 total characters the first
one is a high DPS character called
tracer she is quick she's got a high
damage rate and she uses a couple of
different rift stalker or roguelike
abilities that may remind you of things
like shadow walking or shadow stepping
or whatever you want to call from MMOs
she has a blink that shifts forward in
time pretty cool and that's basically a
jaunt forward and then she's got a
limited time shift backward called
recall which will rewind your movements
back to where you were a couple of
seconds ago pulse pistols are her high
fire rate pistols they shoot very
quickly produce a high DPS but empty
quickly as well and only have 40 bullets
the pulse bomb is a sticky grenade with
a timed detonation you can throw it out
into the field hope someone runs into it
when it explodes or you can jaunt to
them with the blink and stick it on
their face and then recall back out of
there and watch as they detonate so a
sort of Halo sticky bomb plasma grenade
feel there and she has 250 HP in some
videos 115 others but I think 250 is the
base HP for all these classes except for
a select few moving on to the opposite
of tracer is Winston he is effectively
beast from x-men Winston is an armored
tank like gorilla who specializes in
deadly melee and melee combat and Tesla
cannons for ranged death-dealing and the
Tesla cannons are basically Tesla coils
they have some range but not too much
and it just charges up with a left click
and then zaps enemies who are in the
vicinity and sort of a cone in front of
your Tesla coil or Tesla cannon he has a
jump pack which does a large and far
hops so this is useful for closing space
in combat or leaping a top ledge is
basically closing in on the enemy or
escaping a shield projector is his next
ability he drops this on the ground
centrally and
it projects a shield outward you can
enter and exit the shield freely and so
can the enemies but projectiles cannot
primal rage is his special ability his
mode activated with Q and this one is
its it's like breaking his glasses
basically is the idea it lasts nine
seconds it does high damage and has high
moving speed which again helps closing
gaps and do that melee damage he has 500
HP base jumps to 1,000 in rage mode so
it turns into super tank and rage mode
symetra is our next character named for
symmetry she says welcome to my reality
pretty frequently and that implies that
she's some sort of extra dimensional
creature with the ability to warp space
and time which is backed up by her
teleporting abilities symetra has a
shield unlike some of the other
characters she does a photon projector
for her main weapon that is basically a
link cannon from unreal tournament she
holds down left click and it saps their
HP slowly within range as they move
around it walks onto them holding will
charge it in a large blast similar to UT
once again this uses 33 out of the 100
rounds of ammo quite a bit but does kill
and what appears to be one hit although
that could just be the editing of this
video and it does penetrate shields her
sentry turret is somewhat reminiscent of
the TF two centuries but not really
quite the same because you'll see
another character who is almost the same
as TFC centuries she gets three of them
they are short range high damage turrets
next the Symetra has got a shield that
will shield friendly units the shield
eats damage before HP functions just as
you would expect a shield would and she
can place that on allies teleporters are
her final ability she uses one
teleporter at a time it is the special
ability by hitting Q and it looks as if
allies can just spawn on it when
responding it is unclear if they're
coming from another destination or if it
they're just spawning straight on on the
spawning screen symetra has 200 HP base
from what we can tell moving on to
Bastion Bastion is a giant robot he's
sort of like gentle robot meets a
transformer or something and that's
because he can turn into giant freaking
cannons or Gatling guns and drop minds
and all kinds of crazy stuff his first
ability is a high powered assault
configuration that is called which is a
gun that has 20 bullets deal
high damage and has a medium fire rate
he can also reconfigure into siege mode
by hitting shift which activates a
gattling gun turns him into a Gatling
gun a top a swivel and that has a 200
clip magazine with a high fire rate high
damage and it deploys a shield in front
of the player character the player can
pivot about the axis but cannot move
when siege mode is active Bastion can
also self repair which pretty
self-explanatory and finally he's got
remote mines which are basically RC cars
with mines attached to them you can
drive them forward plant it into the
ground and it's similar to a vulture in
StarCraft in that regard the mine then
shoots up effectively like a bouncing
betty equipped with all kinds of
shrapnel that spews out and does the
area of effect damage this is activated
on proximity Bastion has 250 HP as far
as we can tell the Reaper is a grim
reaper that walks in the shadows very
original and Reapers can teleport turn
into wraiths deal death from dual
shotguns and things like that their core
abilities include sounding like a
stalker from Starcraft and hellfire
shotguns which is a seven bullet clip
high damage close-range shot gun and the
close-range works because he's got
Wraith form which terms turns him
incorporeal and makes him in vulnerable
to damage for a short time so he can
close distance very quickly and then use
those put those shotguns to use
shadowstep teleports the Reaper and a
long landing time I noticed in the video
may expose him to attacks from aware of
players so he's got an indicator that
will appear on the ground and show where
he's a where he's spawning after a
teleport and it's unclear whether the
players can fire at that preemptively on
deal damage to the Reaper while he's
still landing the teleport finally his
death blossom is a high damage caught a
flourish it spins and does damaging a
360 degree surrounding circle type thing
and kills lots of players he's got 250
HP base next we've got torbjorn I hope
I'm saying that right toriana is a
bearded dwarf suited up with armor
reminiscent of Warhammer 40k he uses a
giant hammer a riveting gun a wrench and
stationary turrets dish out damage this
might sound familiar because it is a
clone of the
team for just two engineer but that's
okay if it works he can be thought of as
as the nangi from tf2 with his rivet gun
he shoots 20 bullets at a slow fire rate
with high damage on high accuracy so far
as we can tell it is very cannon like in
use and right-click makes it shoots
lower use more ammo at once and create a
burst fire spread the forge hammer is a
melee weapon not shown in combat in any
of the videos the turret is built using
scrap which is basically a element on
your UI just like tf2 and you've got 200
scrap you can put toward one turret or
multiple turrets as far as I understand
and you can improve the turret by adding
more scrap to it up to level 3 armor
packs can be thrown to heal allies or
oneself and then he's finally got a
molten core ability which boosts a 500
HP crazy fast build times on turrets and
it is unclear if damaged Delta is higher
or not after him we've got the
Widowmaker an assassin equipped with
mines a grappling hook and a sniper
rifle she's got the widow's kiss rifle
which is a high fire rate rifle at 30
rounds in the chamber it can shoot
rapidly but right-clicking will turn it
into a sniper rifle which is effectively
one-hit kill to the head grappling hooks
have cooldown use and will grapple to an
object or ledge and then pull her a top
of it I'm curious as to whether the
grapple will be able to pull or do
damage the players have targeted she's
got venom mines which have a cool down
as well it is unclear how long they stay
if used if they're persistent or not and
they will shoot out toxin that kills
enemies quickly but not instantly and
that's on proximity finally she's got
infra site that lets her see through
walls for a brief period effectively she
works for the TSA and that can be
deployed in combination with a sniper
rifle and grappling hook to get
advantage and kill enemies efficiently
Hanzo is our next hero he uses a bow
with barbed arrows instead of guns in
mulan sq garb Hanzo can perform parkour
with Assassin's Creed like movement and
shoot from above he's got a storm bow
with a slow fire rate infinite ammo
and can be pulled back for more damage
as far as I can see his sonic arrow
reveals enemies locations through walls
and objects it has a very long cooldown
I think was 15 seconds but it does
reveal where enemies are so quite
powerful and that can be combined with
dragon strike while climb is parkour
climbing up walls by holding or pressing
space there is no cooldown on the
ability you just hit space to do it and
he climbs up a wall which will be useful
with a slow fire rate bow scatter arrow
is arc lightning with 10 second cooldown
hits multiple targets and those lots of
damage in a area of effect and then
dragon strike his Q ability goes through
walls has a very widespread and insta
kills combining with Sonic arrow very
well for maximum impact he's got 200 HP
base zenyatta is a monk who uses orbs as
a combat element very D&amp;amp;D 3.5 or 3.75
esque and he's a support class or above
destruction is zenyatta medium fire rate
orb with 20 rounds basically snowballs
right-click to charge them up and fire
several all at once minigun style and
all his abilities use the ammo from this
weapon as the main clip which is
somewhat unique from the others orb of
harmony heels and allies supplying a bit
of a support class role to get your
allies up to health orb of discord is a
high damage orb and it is unclear what
the effects are transcendence is his q
ability and it heals all allies in the
nearby area and he's got only 150 HP
base from what we can tell Reinhardt
uses a giant hammer and shield that gets
destroyed regularly throughout all the
class videos you kind of feel bad for
this guy being the test dummy his rocket
hammer is a giant hammer with a medium
attack rate does a lot of damage though
and his close range the shield is a
forward facing shield you can activate
and it slows down his movement pretty
substantially but blocks all incoming
damage charged charges enemies and can
be used to pin them to services and kill
them it is cool down based fire strike
will throw a flaming hammer at targets
with high velocity high damage and range
and then finally earth shatters the Q
ability that knocks back and knocked
down all enemies in a forward facing
cone and reinhart has 600 HP very high
the highest out of all of them next the
last two we've got
farrah who is a rocket trooper with a
jetpack she can jet back into the air
and rain Hellfire missiles down upon
enemies I know that sounds fun
specializes in concussion like a
marauder would do and is very paladin
like in her story her backstory Farrah
uses rocket launchers with six rounds a
slow fire rate high damage and some
collateral damage very similar to TF or
unreal rocket launchers in that in that
capacity she has jump jets that boost to
a location just like Winston did earlier
in the video hover Jets that get into
the air by jumping normally and then use
hoverjets to slowly feather across to
another surface too because of blasts
can knock enemies around it's a very
tactical ability it'll knock them off
ledges and things like that push them
away from objectives and then barrage
jumps into the air immobilizes and
immobilizes farah and rains missiles
down upon targets for a brief period of
time so she's more vulnerable but that's
very high damage finally we've got mercy
an angel of mercy virus on mercy is a
mix of a medic and a support unit
chooses a caduceus staff and can heal
with infinite ammo in a link similar to
the medic in tf2 actually identical to
the medic in tf2 and can also boost
damage of target allies in a link the
caduceus blaster is a medium fire a
pistol with 20 rounds and just just a
pistol that's it her guardian angel
ability boosts to a target ally of flies
straight to them that's pretty cool and
could be used strategically and then
she's got angelic descent which is
basically glide with wings that's a
time-based descent it'll get you farther
along the map hopefully overcoming some
obstacles along the way finally her
resurrect Q ability will bring all
allies on a target radius back to life
pretty crazy and very useful for sure
200 HP on that as far as the overwatch
it's too soon for me to comment if this
game will be any good it's too soon for
me to say if I think it looks fun I
think it has potential I'm scared of
saying much more than that it could
definitely go either way at this point
Blizzard has not had the best track
record for releases lately and they're
definitely trying with hot stew here's
of the storm rather and this game over
watch and overwatch has got a very
mobile like feel but it's still an FPS
I'm concerned that the mobile will be
too strong with this one but we can
hope that the FPS elements are enough to
offset that and get players from both
sides of the arena having fun and
killing one another so that is overwatch
