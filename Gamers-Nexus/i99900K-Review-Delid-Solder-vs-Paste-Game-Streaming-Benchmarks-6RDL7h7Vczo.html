feature in all marketing is its solder
or s Tim or soldered Tim worse Tim so we
decided to test their moles with the new
soldered interface then D live the cpu
and put the Roll paste back on it
because apparently we didn't get the
memo we'll be looking at soldered versus
paste tests gaming benchmarks blender
workloads overclocking and live
streaming benchmarks in our review of
the i9 9900 K before that this video is
brought to you by the be quiet dark rock
4 and dark rock pro 4 CPU coolers these
high-end coolers to focus on a smarter
approach to air cooling by adding a mini
fin stack on top of the direct contact
cold plate adding small bumps to the
fins for increased service area and by
using silent Wayne's 135 millimeter fans
custom-built for high performance
cooling without too much noise the pro
is a duel tower cooler rated for 250
watt TDP while the dark rock 4 is built
for 200 watt CDP's learn more at the
link of the description below very quick
note before we get started we have a new
limited edition shirt on the store it's
this graph logo shirt that's up there on
stored on Karen's ex's net once they're
gone we're not buying more of them and
it's a basically a quad foil shirt so
check that out on the store so the most
important pieces of information if you
missed all the other stuff the new CPU
of the 9900 k is an 8 core part it's got
16 threads it cost 500 30 bucks and it
clocks all core to 4.7 gigahertz with
single core about 5.0 plus or minus a
bit you can overclock it fairly easily
we pushed 5.2 without any effort really
whatsoever and we'll be doing a live
stream later which will put the date and
time on that on the screen where we will
be doing some more serious overclocking
so those are the absolute basics intel
is calling the cpu ninth gen they're
calling the whole well the whole series
nice gen and in reality it's eight gen
it's coffee lake
it's coffee lake architecture but it's
been updated a bit so the silicon's new
it's a new piece of silicon it's bit
larger thigh size which factors into the
thermals but it's not truly a new
generation so keep that in mind as well
other pricing for reference this is 530
bucks so the new CPU today you'll see
that we've taken hours apart already
and the 8700 k previous generation sort
of is 370 bucks present
the 8086 a bit over that the 2700 ex has
recently fallen and is now $300 and the
2700 9x is $250 and you could fairly
trivially overclock that to become a
2700 ex so basically you get a 2700 X
equivalent for 250 bucks so
AMD's most direct competitor is the
eight core 16 thread 2,700 X or 2,700
overclocked CPU and that's what we
looking at for gaming benchmarks
primarily the first thing to start with
here on this new CPU is definitely the
solder which we've replaced with thermal
paste we went backwards we did the
opposite what we normally do so in tell
us it's Tim we're soldered thermal
interface material is the company's
biggest bragging point for the 900k
they've been pushing it hard and
deservedly so this is what all of us in
the enthusiast community I've been
complaining about for years now
so we deleted the 9900 k we removed all
of the solder and replaced it with
thermal grizzly hydro not they're all
pasted to see how does a high-end
thermal paste compared to the solder
because not all solder is created equal
and it might not even be better than the
liquid metal approach we've been using
on previous generation CPUs so basically
we went backwards just to see what would
happen and cue the clip of talking with
Gordon from PC world we're in Gordon
says we can't complain about it now
right it's like we got it
you can always complain okay so with
that in mind let's investigate the 900 K
and see if these solder has been
worthwhile we did a few things for this
test in first we collected all stock
performance numbers and gaming numbers
without deleting it so let's just make
that very clear right away this was all
done after the other testing secondly we
originally had the clever idea to
disable two cores on the 900 K and fixed
the voltage and frequency to equivalent
value says he'd find out in 8086 K after
deleting the 99 hundred K and after
speaking with their Bower we learned too
that the 99 hundred K is not close
enough to the 8086 K to even fudge a
comparison not even if disabling two
cores
the 99 hundred K actually has a thicker
dye package atop the substrate which
impacts results in ways which we can't
or with our clever trick the dye is also
larger which means it dissipates heat
over a wider area and will run cooler
for this reason our 8086 k results we
ran are actually not as comparable as we
wanted instead we will compare the 9900
k with solder to the 99 RK with hydro
not if you'd like to see the results
with liquid metal
we'd strongly encourage you go visit
their borrowers channel and watch his
content he did additional testing with
the lidding and collaborated with us on
our results will be doing liquid metal
in our own testing later and that's
their Bower MIT's acht getting into our
results let's highlight the 9900 k
numbers only
so just highly all 9900 k numbers here's
the fun part first highlighting the 9900
k with solder clock to 5 gigahertz and
with all cores enabled and set to 1.3
for 1 volts after V group is accounted
for the results operated in an average
core temperature of 64 point 4 degrees
Celsius over ambience with ambient logs
every second we also logged currents
into the EPS 12-volt rails every second
which is very important for data
accuracy at 64 degrees core and 14
degrees over ambient liquid the most
direct comparison is the 9900 KD lidded
running 8 cores also at 5 gigahertz this
one operates at 69 point five degrees
over ambience for a rough 5 degree
increase over the solder that's 5 C by
switching from solder to hydro not the
thing Intel bragged about so much its
solder is not much better than a
high-end thermal paste it is worse than
deleting and liquid metal but again
their barrows got those numbers first
and we'll follow up later keeping just
the 99 100 K excuse highlighted we can
next look at these six core tests we ran
it's the same thing here with about 63
degrees over ambient for the D lid or
about 50 9.6 for the stock soldered
version the 8086 k tests are still here
but as we learned from Roman and our own
investigation it's clear that this data
isn't comparable enough to not bother
mentioning what we wanted to leave it
for reference as for power and voltage
during these tests
here's what we're looking at power
consumption for the 9900 k-6 core 5
gigahertz task was not 194 watts close
enough to the 180 9.6 watt power
consumption of the 1900 K 6 quart D lid
to be comparable the 8 core variation of
the nine hundred K measured 260 watts
put up against 269 watts and our D
loaded test
this is within reasonable control
although the deleted variants might be
marginally cooler if we were able to
drop at another nine watts voltage was
also logged and measured it's one point
three for one volts for all eight core
tests in one point three five volts Ross
six core tests there was a
viju fish you as a result of a C's of
BIOS and that's where those numbers come
from solder is a reversion back to the
Sandy Bridge era this is something Intel
needed to do even though it's not
perfect even though it's not better than
liquid metal because it's a thinner
sheet of it it's still better than what
Intel was using and this is important
and for that we praise Intel for at
least doing solder you know it's not the
best implementation the kind that we'd
like to see but it's better and Intel
this isn't a service of course to the
community they're not doing it just
because they got annoyed with everyone
Intel's doing this because Intel needs
the extra couple hundred megahertz that
the thermal difference affords them
Intel has a real competitor now and
suddenly having solder is just enough on
this 14 nanometer aging the hot process
that it can get Intel another one
hundred two hundred megahertz and allow
some more overclocking Headroom so this
was a necessary move and one that we are
at least mostly happy with it's not
perfect if you deal it and do liquid
metal you'll still get probably better
results based on what their bearer was
saying and we'll have our own numbers on
that soon but for most people we
probably wouldn't recommend deleting at
this point because the solder is good
enough it's just that if you're really
pushing the extreme then yes it might be
worth going that route still it's just a
hell of a lot of work to clean it up and
we'll talk about that more later in a
separate content peace stream benchmarks
are next we define this testing and the
article linked in description below if
you want more information I will play
some side-by-side clips without
revealing the CPU is while explaining
this testing for the basics we're
testing with OBS we're capturing
gameplay while streaming at various
quality settings generally faster is a
good enough h.264 quality setting and is
typically what we use in our own streams
fast and medium improved quality at
great performance cost but quickly
descend into placebo territory at medium
and beyond
still it offers a good synthetic
workload to find it leaders be
the most practical use cases because
these CPUs are powerful enough that they
have no trouble at faster and even fast
most of the time we are testing with
fortnight and dota 2 on the 9900 K and
the 2700 X when both are stock fortnight
is set to high as is dota 2 and both are
1080p and streamed at 60 fps we also
measure baseline performance without any
active streams to better understand
performance loss from streaming
streaming is heavily multi-threaded so
for people who want quote multi tasking
benchmarks this is it
starting with streamer side fps and
fortnight we observed a baseline
framerate of 258 FPS average when not
streaming at all note that this is
streamer side this is what the player
sees not what the viewer sees we'll get
to that in a moment and viewer side is
arguably more important we were hitting
GPO constraints at the top-end in this
benchmark the lows remained moderately
time that 161 fps 1% and 117 fps 0.1%
lows are 720 700 X is next in 2 operates
at 200 FPS average for its baseline
performance in terms of frame times
we're looking at about 3.9 milliseconds
with a 9900 K vs. 5 milliseconds or the
2700 X with the 9900 K streaming at 10
megabits per second and using fast h.264
encoding we lose about 27% off of the
baseline and land at 188 FPS average
loads remain spaced proportionately to
the average the 2700 X drops to 124 FPS
average losing about 38% off of its
baseline that doesn't mean its worst
necessarily because we also need to look
at viewer side frame throughput coming
up next
remember there are two pieces to this
and at 12 megabits per second for medium
encoding this increases the quality at a
huge performance cost with the 900k of
falling to 170 FPS average with low is
now entering worst territory at 43 fps
0.1% low the 2,700 X Falls to 118 FPS
average when using the 12 megabit per
second medium and code quality here's a
frame time plot of the 900 K at 10
megabits per second faster is 12
megabits per second medium and baseline
for these plots the most important
metric is consistency of the line
alongside the lower overall values lower
is better but more consistent is better
than lower we're looking at the interval
frames a frame with 16 milliseconds
equating to 60 fps the 12 megabit per
second medium result occasionally spy
close to 80 millisecond frame times
which can create a noticeable stutter or
latency difference between surrounding
frames and this is why these frame time
plots are really important they're not
used enough when we're trying to use
them more because it shows results where
sometimes they would get averaged out
even with 1% to 0.1% lo metrics here's
the 2,700 X plot performance is overall
lower as a result of the lower frequency
but the baseline and 10 mega section
fast results are still relatively
consistent although we don't see a spike
up to 80 milliseconds this time must
also note that a single frame at 80
milliseconds is not the norm on the 900k
either we've seen consistent frame
intervals of 40 milliseconds hit
throughout the test on both products
when streaming with the torture workload
of medium quality settings let's take a
look at some side-by-side footage of
fortnight at 10 megabits per second and
fast we won't reveal which CPUs which
until the end of this clip for the
streamer the takeaway is that the
streamer gets a good experience on both
platforms Intel is technically superior
here but the cost of the 1900 K is a
consideration as well we'll talk about
that in the conclusion for now either
platform looks playable to the streamer
what we need to know is if the output is
any good to the viewer as that is the
most important part of the equation
that's what you've been looking at here
in the playback as well let's reveal the
CPUs and then move on viewer experience
has boiled down to percent of frames
delivered at 1080p 60fps via YouTube in
our testing both the 2700 xn9 900k were
able to deliver 100% of frames at 10
megabits per second and fast encoding
which is perfectly adequate for any
streamer really the 12 magnet per second
medium quality setting is entering
placebo territory though still has some
benefits with fast encoding the 9900 K
delivered 87% of its frames within 16
point 6 7 milliseconds or 60fps the
2,700 X delivered 96.5% of its frames
within the same window we've seen this
behavior before and found that Intel
stabilizes its delivery when manually
managing process priority this has
something to do with task scheduling on
each device with medium settings in
solace 9900 K is impressive in its
ability to still deliver a consistently
good viewer experience at 98% of all
frames encoded the 2,700 X delivers just
68.4% of its frames in the same test a
result of its lower frequency let's get
a side-by-side of these two up again
with this quality setting it's leaning
into placebo tears
we want to emphasize that the 2700 acts
is still perfectly good for streaming
and gaming simultaneously you just want
to keep it to 10 megabits per second and
fast an adult can maintain higher
quality settings but it may be an
unnecessary level of quality overall it
just depends on how serious you are
about streaming ultimately a secondary
system would still improve low on frame
times and is probably what you want to
use if you're a professional highly
competitive stream or something like
csgo or dota moving on to dota 2 we
start again with streamer side fps this
is what the host of the stream sees dota
2 tends to favor Intel CPUs hard for
frequency dependence following Amdahl's
law well and positions the 9900 K at the
top of the chart the CPU output to 191
FPS average with low is mixed at 124 fps
n 55 FPS 0.1% the 2700 X manages 144 FPS
average baseline when we start streaming
those numbers dropped to 151 fps for the
900k with fast settings or 134 fps went
under medium settings the 2700 X drops
to 92 fps and 84 fps respectively and
here's some side by side of the 2700 X
and 9900 K when using 10 megabits per
second fast settings overall both are
reasonable performers for the streamer
the 12 megabit per second medium frame
times get a bit jumpy particularly on
the 2,700 X with a 0.1% low of 20 but
it's not terrible and ultimately you
should be using fast anyway
your site performance is where it
matters for this one the 9900 K and
2,700 X boats managed to encode 100% of
frames at 10 megabits per second fast
this means that viewers will see all 60
frames per second when viewing the
stream and so will not be able to
perceive a quality difference between
the 99 30 K and the 27 X they are
functionally the same planning favor to
the 2700 experts value proposition
although it is behind in the streamer
side performance if you did want more
quality each 12 megabyte per second
medium playback retains a lead for the
900 km functionally 100% of frames
encoded the 2700 X falling to 92% of
frames encoded you're looking at
side-by-side footage now of the 2790
900k at 12 megabits per second medium
will reveal them at the end of the clip
and again it's not terrible and can be
compensated for with a permanent
overclock or with a slight reduction in
settings for the 2700 axis performance
the 2700 X does better here than what we
saw in a fortnight part of this
down to resource allocation and how the
games work of course frame capping the
for either game on the streamer side
would also help and would pick up
performance on the stream side the
output as well although that may be
inadvisable for some ultra competitive
players if you need every single frame
on your end but maybe a secondary system
is better for you anyway let's review
all those CPUs before moving on power
consumption while streaming is an
interesting topic
this chart is for fortnight power
consumption with the ASUS Maximus 11
hero that we used for our 9900 Kay
there's a stricter adherence Intel stock
policies than with some of the other
boards this means we see a sharp
drop-off in power consumption when
testing under full stock conditions the
CPU Falls to 100 watts a load and stays
there measured at the EPS 12 volt cables
leaving more performance available if we
were to remove power targets and limits
some of the other motherboards shipping
today will exit these Intel power specs
and draw more power than what you're
seeing here it just depends on what
board you're using and how well they
follow Intel's policies the 2700 X
pushes closer to about 120 to 125 watts
power draw in town manages to achieve
better overall combined throughput for
both the player and viewer side
experience while maintaining a lower
power consumption for which the 9900 Kay
deserves acclaim Intel has done well
here to optimize their output maintain
high frequencies and not suck down a ton
of power until you overclock it which is
something we'll do later this is of
course at a significantly higher cost
than the 2700 X competitor and that's a
massive factor that will play into our
conclusion getting into the game
benchmarks we start with Far Cry 5 this
one runs on the dunia engine by Ubisoft
and is also used in our GPU task bench
at 1080 P V 9900 Cape which is 157 FPS
average 119 FPS 1% lows and well times 1
to 2 FPS 0.1% blows overclocked the 1900
K ends up at 163 FPS average for a
reasonable gain of 4.5% over these stock
to 9900 K the 8700 K ends up around 155
FPS when overclocked to 5 gigahertz
meaning the stock 9,900 cat in your
equivalents these stock 8700 case it's
closer to 141 FPS average when looking
at the i5 CPU we noticed a clear drop in
frame time consistency as the frame to
frame interval became more sporadic
represented by the i5 eight
600k 0.1% low metric the r7 2,700 at 4.2
gigahertz meanwhile ended up at 111 FPS
average within margin of error of the
overclocked r5 2600 at the same
frequency target and again the 2700 at 4
points you gigahertz and the 2600 are
within variance of each other at this
point and can be considered roughly
equal the 900 K has a clear lead in far
cry 5 and performance follows a similar
trend as an assassin's creed which
you'll see later both our Ubisoft games
but they are different engines although
those engines may share some code
I have 1440p performance becomes capped
at around 147 FPS average as the GPU is
that leaned on more heavily United I
heart ek maintains 146 FPS average the
8700 K at 5 gigahertz again meets its
performance and the 8600 K does the same
except its thread deficit does pose
problems for frames of frame interval
consistency the 2700 at 4 points you
gigahertz post roughly the same
performance as before as we'd expect
because it's almost fully CPU
constrained the overclocked
2,700 2,700 X are not fast enough to
keep up with the 1440p throughput under
normal settings with a 20 80 TI if we
were to boost options the high settings
and fully leverage the GPU then the
natural expectation is that all results
will be dragged down to meet the GPU cap
f 1 2018 runs on the ego engine by
Codemasters
and is our first representation of a
game of that nears 300 FPS it's at this
point that most people would probably be
happy with just about any CPU on this
chart even the r7 1700 and it's 183 FPS
result the 99 100k posts an impressive
284 FPS average one stock thanks to
coupling it with the 2080 Ti and the
overclocked pushes it to 291 FPS average
for the 8700 K at 5 gigahertz we see a
270 FPS average result that permits the
99 hundred KS stock CPU elite of 5.2%
if we compare the stock 8700 KS to 48
fps average to the 99 hundred K the
difference is closer to about 14% that's
with both stock the 2700 at four points
you gigahertz ends up at 212 FPS average
with Louis still reasonably times this
posts a 27% improvement and the
900k although it's sort of misleading as
a stat at this point to state the
percentage improvement fps scales
nonlinearly
a 27% gain at nearing 300 fps means a
whole lot less than a 27% gain at 60fps
the difference from 48 to 60 fps using
this example is often noticeable in
gameplay whereas the difference between
two hundred and seventy FPS and two
hundred and twelve FPS is really not
observable to most people although
certainly some pros could probably tell
the difference moving on some 1440p the
9900 k is now squished down to 240 FPS
average by the RT x20 atti bottleneck
this limits overclocking improvements
heavily and also caps the nine hundred K
stock see beauty 238 FPS average the
8700 K is just behind at 235 fps and the
2700 at 420 gigahertz manages to a 1 FPS
average this posts a slight dip in spite
of the GPU limitation versus the
previous round we've seen this in the
past with AMD CPUs like in battlefield 1
from last year's testing Assassin's
Creed origins uses the anvilnext 2.0
game engine by Ubisoft and runs on
DirectX 11 at 1080p and medium settings
we are minimally GPU constrained in an
otherwise GPU intensive game the 9900 K
leads the pack at 135 FPS average 1
stock and also illustrates that we are
hitting GPU bottlenecks at this point
the overclocked only gains us 2 FPS or
1.5% and so we can't see the
unconstrained performance in this game
still we balanced between realism and
proper methodology here and going too
far one way or the other doesn't really
result in a great benchmark going lower
than medium is unrealistic and so will
point toward our other unconstrained
tests for examples of the top and
performance like f1 2018
still the 900k leads the 8700 K is stock
CPU is 112 FPS average by about 21% on
both our stock overclocking the 8700 K
pushes it to 123 FPS average closing the
gap but only because we are limited by
the GPU on the 900 K this is a realistic
example of how even a 2080 TI can become
bound by 9900 K and so it's still
important to show when the gains of a
higher on CPU become CAF by even
and unrealistically or unreasonably
expensive video card the 2700 X was only
tested in Assassin's Creed origin and
ashes to illustrate that it is
functionally the same as an overclocked
2700 or just below it anyway so that's
here just as a reminder of that
performance in this game we see the 2700
X line between an overclocked 2700 at
4.2 gigahertz and a stock 2700 as you'd
expect there are 2700 post 104 FPS
average results this puts it ahead of
the stock 8600 k and led by the 9900 k a
stock CPU by about 31% this is also why
we recommend buying the non X CPUs in
most instances because it's so easy to
overclock and you save some money
the 900k holds a clear lead here that's
not unexpected at this point at 1440p
assassin's creed origins illustrates a
clearer GPU limit at 122 FPS average
where the 9900 case it's under both
configurations the stock and overclocked
results are tied with the difference of
being within margin of error 8700 K
isn't far behind at 117 FPS average and
the 2,700 at 4.2 gigahertz posts a 102
FPS average result differences
absolutely still exist at 1440p but they
do diminish for civilization 6 we use
the AI benchmark to analyze turn time
processing this is represented in a unit
of time not famous per second but rather
seconds and so we're looking at the
number of seconds to process a single
turn this is taken from an average of
five turns processed multiplied across
four runs if it takes a CPU ten seconds
to process one turn and you have six AI
players in the game that would be about
one minute per full rotation before it
is the players turn again that starts to
get noticeable a faster CPU reduces this
wait time resolution is also irrelevant
here the results would be the same at
1440p the 9900 K when overclocked posts
a turn completion time of eleven point
four seconds remember lower is better
and so it's leading the pack the stock
9900 K operates at eleven point seven
seconds per turn
with these 79 60 X overclocked to four
point six gigahertz tied at eleven point
seven seconds as well so a mistake seems
like frequency to some degree so we are
seeing a boost in the 79 60 X from
twelve point six seconds when pushed to
four point six gigahertz this statement
frequency dependence following on dolls
law is further reinforced when looking
at the 8700 K and 8600 k5 gigahertz
results both of which end up at around
eleven point eight and eleven point nine
seconds so our seven twenty seven
hundred four points u gigahertz ends up
at twelve point seven seconds per turn
the total time requirement to complete
turns is reduced by eight percent on the
nine nine hundred K versus the
overclocked 2700 which is the same as a
stock 2700 X it's an eight percent time
reduction in the most suitable
comparison GTA v runs on the rage engine
from Rockstar and is our oldest tested
title a popular announced remain on the
bench for now at 1080p and with high and
very high settings the 99 hundred K
operated around 172 FPS average boosted
by the five point two gigahertz
overclocked to 179 FPS average note that
we are running into engine limitations
here best illustrated by the dismal i5
results for the eighty six hundred K
this is a story we busted open about a
year ago but it's worth reiterating when
i5 CPU is bounced off of the 187 FPS
marker in GTA 5
they stutter insanely and instantly hard
to resolve this you'd actually want to
run a lower average framerate in GTA so
that it avoids the frame limiter at the
high end this issue seems to primarily
affect I 5 CPUs as we discovered
previously it's clear that Rockstar also
hasn't fixed it since the discovery
either way the primary focus is
elsewhere the 87 arcade stock CPU posted
a 159 FPS average with the overclocked
results at 168 FPS average that's a
market gain which puts it near the 9900
Kay's stock CPU like most games GTA does
it like frequency first and foremost our
720 700 are 4.2 gigahertz again
basically 2500 ax ends up at 143 FPS
average allowing these stock 900k about
a 20% lead this is about what we'd
expect at 1440p scaling remains the same
or about the same it's just the ceiling
has dropped down the 900 K now caps at
160 FPS average when overclocked or
stock as do the 8700 k + 79 60 X CPUs
this is a result of hitting the GPU
limit the r7 2700 at 4:20 gigahertz
still remains below that limit and so
posts a similar result to its result at
1080p we're at around 143 FPS average on
the 2700 X stand-in here blender
performance is up next for our in-house
GN monkey head Ren
that's built specifically for CPU
stressing the 9900 EK finishes the image
in 20 minutes marking it as 9% slower
than the stock i 970 900 x x 299 cpu
overclocking the 9900 k2 5.2 gigahertz
pushes us to a 17 minute completion time
roughly tying with a moderately
overclocked 7 900 x as for the 2700 x
that's represented by our overclocked
2700 at four point two gigahertz
remember and he uses the same cpus all
the way down the line
so overclocking a 2700 to this degree is
basically the same as 2700 x over fox
2700 ends up at 22 and a half minutes
for a speed improvement of 11% on the
stock 9900 k or 24% on the overclocked
at 9900 k our next render test is a
single frame from the jeon intro
animation which will just go ahead and
replay it back now for this one the 9900
k finishes the render in twenty five and
a half minutes compared to the stock 7
900 X and overclocked 9900 K at twenty
point eight minutes each overclocked
7900 X still manages a time reduction of
13% from its thread advantage the
overclocked 2700 at 4.2 gigahertz
completes the render in twenty six point
six minutes allowing the 9900 K
overclocked CPU a time reduction of 22%
to twenty point eight minutes well
that's worth the extra money is
dependent on how time intensive your
workloads are and now we bring it all
the way around back to the conclusion
Intel gets major credit for doing solder
it's not the thing that everyone dreamed
of when we look at the results but it's
still way better than the therole paste
until you used to use the dow corning
paste now technically the 9900 k is also
still the chart-topping gaming cpu so
Intel gets credit for remaining yes as
they say the best in quotes and it's in
quotes because we're at best means a
whole lot of things different people
it's not the best value it's not the
best price but it is the best just in
terms of raw throughput whether or not
that matters to you
depends on how neurotic you are about
your frame rate if you're the type of
person who absolutely needs to hit 240
FPS on that new monitor and you've got a
video card that can sustain it then sure
but a lot of the time the 2700 X or e
the 8700 K and Intel can't be mad for
commending their previous CPU are both
fine parts for achieving high frame rate
gain and that's what you have to look at
and figure out to you how much does
having the fastest really matter versus
having an extra couple hundred bucks
because Andy's a real competitor now and
Intel's not alone anymore in the arena
so we have to consider AMD as an
alternative these days when it used to
not be the case and as always thank you
