hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the gigabyte X
570 master motherboard so this is
obviously a you know a.m. for
motherboard based on the X of X 570
chipset meant for the new Rison 3000
series CPUs and I am recording this
video so far in advance of the actual
CPU launch that I know basically nothing
about the CPUs other than there's going
to be a 16 core and a 12 core and an 8
core so I know how many cores there's
gonna be I don't know when they're
launching how much they're gonna cost
how they're gonna clock how much power
they're gonna pull basically I don't
really have any information that would
really help me with sort of gauging how
overkill this motherboard in front of us
is though it should be pretty damn over
killed before that this video is brought
to you by drop and their HD 6 xx
headphones the 6 xx headphones offer
high-quality audio output with wide
device compatibility mouth drops 6 xx
also includes a 6 foot cable with 3.5
millimeter plug alongside a quarter inch
adapter for those who might want to plug
into an app the 6x axe focuses its
energy into balancing the sound leaning
toward warmer and base your audio
they're also easy to disassemble and
replace individual parts making these
headphones trivial to maintain for
long-term use
learn more at the link below this is not
gigabyte highest end board there's also
the X 570 extreme but this has a lot of
what made like this keeps a lot of what
makes the extreme so very extreme so
then let's get right into it starting
off with the most interesting section of
gigabytes new x5 70 series motherboards
at least in my opinion I think a lot of
people might be like builds like the v
RM really isn't that interesting but
damn it this is my video so I say the RM
is most interesting section so first of
all we have a V core
this right here is our V core erm next
to that we of course have the SOC v RM
so that power is the system-on-a-chip
portion of a normal rise in CPU I would
assume that for the upcoming rise in
3000 series this is going to be powering
the iodine also if you're running an APU
this does power
the eye GPU though this motherboard as
far as I can tell does not have any
display outputs so you know the fact
that this can power the eye GPU is kind
of irrelevant in this case now what
makes this v core VR the this VRM
configuration really really special like
right now you might be looking at this
and be like oh there's not that much
this is not that different from other
boards we've seen it before but this has
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve
phases and no doublers in the v core
section and then the SOC is just another
two phases so this is not you know these
aren't fake these these this is actually
twelve this is an actual 12 plus
two-phase VRM and the reason for that is
is like the X 570 extreme the master
uses this chip right here which is an
Infineon X do this this photos so
high-res that you can actually read it
right off of the chip but that is an XD
PE 1 3 2 g 5 C so part number worse than
ever before ir35 2:01 kind of rolls off
the tongue kind of rolls off the tongue
after you've said it often enough this
this never does this is just too damn
long but this right here is a 16 phase
controller from Infineon Infineon is the
company that actually owns international
rectifier so you know you can kind of
consider them interchangeable now this
thing is this thing exists primarily for
powering like insane server setups and
you know like non-consumer pc
non-consumer design silicon designs
where you have chips that are absolutely
massive and can pull easily as much as a
thousand amps like that's actually the
use case for this that that's like the
design that's the use case for this
controller right here is just like in
Finian's marketing is like this is the
first proper 1,000 amp
voltage regulator that like we've made
and it's really meant for servers but
hey that never said like that that's
never stopped consumer motherboard
vendors from you know
shoving super-high-end voltage regulator
components onto onto motherboards that
are never going to power anything with
quite as many cores or as much power
consumption as a server platform but so
still like this is not a new thing that
we have like high-end server grade parts
on a consumer board but it is a new
thing that we have an actual 16 phase
like this was previously not possible
there's never been a controller that
went all the way up to 16 phases there's
been like one or two controller well
there's more recently there's the mp-28
88 which goes up to 10 phases but in the
past there's also been some controllers
like I think UPI semiconductor had a 12
phase at one point in time but that
quickly became like nobody really used
it that much but 16 phases this this is
a first like this is the first time
there's ever been a controller that goes
up to this many phases so problems 2
gigabyte for just going right for it
what as soon as it arrived it's like oh
yeah we we like having a lot of phases
we would prefer not having to use
doublers for them and the reason why
you'd prefer not to use doublers to get
lots and lots of phases is that while
doublers have their upsides you know you
can get better vrm efficiency you can
get reduced output ripple because you
effectively have all your phases
interleaved the the downsides are having
a bunch of doublers is that you put a
bit of delay on to your PWM signals and
I can potentially make that basically
makes it more difficult to optimize the
transient response of the vrm which you
know for CPU is not really a huge it
like not really a huge priority because
unlike GPUs CPUs don't really power
cycle anywhere near as hard but still
you know it can make the different like
there there's ways to design around it
but ultimately hey if you can buy a 16
phase controller you can have all the
benefits of having 12 interleaved phases
and none of the downsides of doing it
with you know six six phases and a set
of doublers so yeah
awesome awesome controller to see right
here and the X 570 extreme also uses it
and actually uses it to further
capability of the the 14 plus 2
configuration the plus 2 of course here
is for the SOC vrm now the actual vrm
itself the the well
core and SOC vrm the the power stages
used our international rectifier 35:56
is which actually puts this x5 70 master
well above say the z3 90 master in terms
of erm power delivery capability which
is just kind of a interesting thing in
my opinion because well not well above
well it's 25% I'd consider that well
above so the 35:56 is a 50 amp power
stage whereas what you'd find on like
the z3 90 master is a 40 amp power stage
they both still have 12 phases it's just
that these phases are quite a bit more
substantial than what you would find on
the master so what that means for the
via vcore vrm efficiency here keep in
mind I have no idea how much power a say
overclocked 16 core rise in 3000 series
CPU is gonna pull just absolutely no
idea I've not been given that I've not
been given any reliable information on
that but we can still talk about how you
know the the efficiency capability like
the vrm power delivery capabilities and
just kind of once the CPUs come out we
can go okay well they pull this much and
then you can fit well with this
motherboard the this motherboards
efficiency well power delivery kit well
efficiency and power delivery like the
thing is if you're vrm is not very
efficient that just means you need to
put a bigger heatsink on it now at some
point your heat sinks just never gonna
be big enough so you need a very
efficient vrm to not to be able to
handle a lot of power without like
resorting to water cooling the vrm in
order to keep it from overheating so
anyway the RM efficiency we're gonna be
looking at 1.2 volts output because
that's the voltage that the datasheet of
these is spectin and it's just
convenient for me to use especially
since I don't know if we're gonna be
running these 16 like I don't know if
we're gonna be running the rise in 3000
series chips on 1.5 volts or one point
one volts right like it's 7 nanometer we
could be looking at very little voltage
we could also be looking at a ton of
voltage like who knows who knows how am
d-- decided to to go with the chip
design the 400 kilohertz switching
frequency because again that's where the
datasheet is specular also gigabyte
tends to actually like their gigabytes
recent motherboards that use the
various ir35 50 series power stages are
like 3553 35:56 is they all tend to
default to 400 kilohertz switching
frequency so I'm assuming they're not
gonna be changing that for this one so
400 kilohertz switching frequency and 5
volts Drive and the the reason why I'm
pointing out the 5 volts Drive voltage
is because the datasheet for these
actually has all of its efficiency
curves done at 7 volts Drive which is
not great for the reliability of these
power stages like you can run them on 7
volts they're just not gonna last as
long so essentially they're over voltage
for the purposes of the efficiency
curves in the datasheet to make them
look a bit better there's some GPUs that
actually like run these on like 6 volts
but gigabyte for their motherboards they
always go with 5 volts so 5 volts drive
for these ultimately it doesn't really
make that much of a difference to the
overall efficiency it's just a couple
percent anyway so 100 amps output at 1.2
volts so about 120 amp 120 watts going
into the CPU you're gonna be looking at
about 13 watts of heat dissipation so
yeah like the RM shouldn't even need a
heatsink at that point plenty of surface
area lots of phases you know you're
looking at a little over a watt per
power stage in the V R M so you
shouldn't even need a heatsink at that
point as long as you have even just
moderate airflow over the vrm section
now going up to 150 amps 1.2 volts
output you're gonna be looking at about
17 watts of heat coming off of the power
stages again so at this point you know a
heatsink might be advisable but it
doesn't need to be very substantial
especially considering that this is a 12
phase actually you'd probably be able to
get away with no heatsink depending
again on your airflow situation and
going up to 200 amps output we're gonna
be looking at about 22 watts of heat
coming off of the power stages and that
basically well at this point you you do
want to have a heatsink okay it doesn't
need to be the the world's biggest
heatsink ever but you do want to have a
heatsink airflow is kind of optional
still and especially considering that
like with the heat sink that gigabyte
house on the Z's
Oris Master if they go with like the
same style of heatsink for this board
like yeah this will be no problem and
will be no problem for this board to
handle now going up to 200 and not 250
at this point like 200 amps I think is
kind of unlikely for a rise in 16 like
even for the 16 Cory I think this is
like a worst-case scenario situation
that you would hit 200 amps on ambient
cooling because the thing is is like
it's one thing to say oh yeah you can
totally shove that much power into the
CPU it's another thing when you need to
actually cool that much power and
generally well I don't know how the
thermal density is gonna work out the
the cores are gonna be kind of offset
from Center so that might affect how
efficient various water blocks are so
yeah not really sure how this this is
gonna work out I kinda think this might
be the limit for a CPU in this package
sighs then again if we think back to the
effect well no the FX series CPUs were
right around sort of the 1.5 volts 200
amps like if you had an FX 8 core that
that's roughly what you'd be looking at
so yeah this is a huge upgrade over like
the best am3+ motherboard ever made this
vrm right here like it doesn't even
compare so yeah I'm just realizing how
like the am3+ motherboards were so
sketchy to rut like some of them are so
sketchy to run an eight-core on and then
it's like oh here it's like you know
just 22 watts yeah so you know like this
might be pretty much the limit if if
that's even possible but going up past
that you know just for the sake of what
the motherboard can do 300 amps output
you'd be looking at about 36 watts of
heat a good heatsink design a good
heatsink and some air flow should have
no problem handling that going up even
further than that 400 amps at this point
we're kind of going outside of where
you'd want to run this VR I'm like this
this one's really designed for sort of
the 200 amps that that's kind of the
sweet spot for this vrm is 150 to 200
amps and then going up past that if we
go to 400 amps output you're gonna be
looking at about 59 watts of heat which
is like that that's a lot you can
definitely do
you know we RM he thinks I can handle
that especially considering that this is
a twelve face so it's not all crammed
into just a couple power stages but uh
it is still like that that's not you
know an ignoring amount of heat luckily
I think four hundred amps is probably
only achievable if you're on a line to
cooling and even there it might not be
possible who knows like again I have no
details on the CPUs but if you know like
on lnto the thing is you're not gonna be
running that load for a very long time
so it doesn't actually matter that you
know as long as the arm doesn't overheat
before you finish the benchmark you're
fine so that there is like that's
concerning for like long-term usage a
lot long-term loads not necessarily for
you know even extreme overclocking and
going up to five hundred amps at this
point we're very much you know ninety
three watts of heat output the the thing
about like a lot of the power stages
when they're spec for 50 amps well
they're the the way that spec works is
considering a single power stage which
is okay like basically surrounded by a
great big square of just empty copper
and it's like yeah we can totally push
50 amps through that one power stage
under these testing conditions
it doesn't really consider what happens
when you put you know 12 of the 50 amp
power stages next to each other and it's
like well now we have 93 watts of heat
instead of just because this is a little
over this is a little over like eight
watts per power stage so if you have one
of them that's not really a big deal if
you have 12 well actually that's is it a
little it's slightly under eight watts
per power stage for this so you know if
you have one of them not really a big
deal if you have 12 of them you get you
got a problem it's 93 watts you actually
like a lot of airflow substantial
heatsink that this is not something you
just kind of you know like this is not
something you would actually want to
sustain the holder sustained sustained
output out of this vrm unless you have
something like a delta fan cooling it
still a very powerful vrm on this
motherboard i mean you know it is
stronger than what you get on those e39
urs master it's it's like that doesn't
in
like it does get better than this but
I'd say better than this is kind of
unnecessary so yeah like the extreme is
extreme like the extreme is extreme for
a reason and it's even better than this
this right here but uh this already is
more than enough especially within sort
of the SE nor can't draw levels even up
to 300 amps I mean that's still if you
have a good heatsink design you can
totally handle 36 watts spread across 12
phases that's not a problem so yeah you
know brought like XIII the this thing is
just kind of carrying on the legacy of
the XIII 90 master where it's like we've
got a 12 phase we got decent we've got
good power stages got a solid vrm and
they've actually upgraded the power
stages on this thing so yeah
you know it just gets better then for
the soc BRM we have more 50 amp power
stages since this doesn't have a display
output is like the end the AP UI GPU
doesn't really pull that much power it's
just like well the this exists don't
worry about it the main concern here is
the v court also you know gigabyte is
going with the dual 8 pin power
connectors for CPU power I have like
I've heard some things about the 16 core
I have serious doubts that you would
ever actually exceed the power delivery
capabilities of the single ap you can
easily like I've been pushing 300 watts
into ITX as III 90mph
okay actually I think I've been pushing
over 300 watts into Z 390 ITX ports like
you're nowhere near maxing out this this
ape and power connector until like the 8
pin can do at least 400 watts if if you
have a halfway decent power supply and
it will get warm okay it's not like it's
gonna be ice-cold but it will still be
within the tolerances of all of the the
materials used to build it so yeah I
don't really think the 16 core has a
chance of overloading the the single 8
pin but hey you know maybe if you're on
if you're on liquid nitrogen
who knows maybe maybe the 16 core scales
- like 2 volts at - under 96 degrees
pulls a thousand watts there's already a
different 16 core from you know Intel
that does that so it could be possible
that the this ends up doing something
similar and in that case the extra 8 pin
would be kind of handy wouldn't it
but yeah for ambient the the single pipe
and is more than enough so yeah that's
the that's the power delivery on the
board for the CPU moving on for the
memory power we just have a like you
know it's nothing nothing impressive but
it's nothing bad so we've got the
standard gigabyte single-phase we've got
our our t8 120 voltage controller over
here we've got our 4 C 10 n high side
MOSFET then another 4 C 10 and as a low
side and another 4 C 10 and as another
low side this is gigabytes go to
single-phase memory of erm for like the
last several years I want to say that
they've just been running this memory of
erm I know it works fine it's perfectly
acceptable I've never had any oh well
yeah I've never had any sort of memory
overclocking issues on gigabyte
motherboards related to the actual vrm
most most of the time when you're
looking at ddr4 overclocking because
ddr4 really doesn't pull that much power
the the main concern with ddr4
overclocking is everything that happens
between the memory slots and the CPU and
arguably the output filtering of the vrm
but uh and that looks like a pretty
standard gigabyte affair these
capacitors right here I'm wondering if
that might be just because this isn't
technically this board is a engineering
sample the retail boards are always rev
1.0 so this is an engineering sample
board so it might be just like that
they're not there for testing or
something I'm not sure normally these
would I would assume these end up being
populated because it's pretty standard
to have bulk capacitance between the
memory controller and the DIMM slots
that's just kind of a standard thing for
a lot of higher-end motherboards about
AB so you can mess around with like the
output filtering but most of it comes
down to what do you do with all of the
traces running in this area and in that
aspect all of gigabytes x5 17
motherboards are actually going to be
using a daisy-chain memory layout which
favors a to dim which generally favors
to dim configure 8 to dim configurations
because there's basically two layouts
that you can look to have on a
motherboard there's t topology where you
have equal lengths to both DIMM slots on
each channel so like this is
channel and then you have the next
channel so teach apology looks something
like that
daisy-chain just looks like bam it's
much easier to layout it's much simpler
to layout and daisy-chain actually like
the daisy chains issue is that you end
up with a timing difference between this
dim and that dim there's a timing
difference between the two but if you're
only using you know one one dim slaw on
each channel so like a two by eight
configuration or a two by sixteen
configuration daisy chain works really
really well assuming the motherboards
BIOS is also tuned for it cuz you know
if if you screw up your memory training
setup then it kinda doesn't matter what
layout you have because it's just like
well the board's gonna be set up wrong
but since with with AMD CPUs there's the
a GSA which is much like as I understand
it the motherboard vendors don't have
anywhere near as much power to mess with
the memory training algorithms on AMD
CPUs as they have on Intel so I would
assume like and the thing is on X 470
all of the like MSI uses daisy-chain
asus uses daisy chain asrock uses daisy
chain so I'm assuming basically what's
been happening is that the asrock asus
and msi feed back to AMD about hey how
to tune the memory training algorithm
has been tune it for daisy chain and at
this point it's just like well it works
best with daisy chain so everybody's
going to daisy chain so i think
ultimately the board should be you know
if nothing else pretty consistent and
I'm kind of happy that gigabytes going
to daisy chain because in the past
they've used it apology and the thing is
yeah it really doesn't work
it does cap your maximum frequency when
running to DIMM slots over running when
running to dims over for demons so it
should work better for you know the the
more casual memory setups instead of the
insane like four by eights or four by
sixteen setups you can still make daisy
chain work in a you know four by four by
eight or a four by sixteen setup it's
just a bit more work but considering
that daisy chain has been standard 4 X 4
7 X 4 70 for basically three of the four
big motherboard vendors I'd assume that
it's already AM d already has it pretty
well fine-tuned even for
Fortnum configurations so anyway that's
some memory power over here and then
we've got a postcode which is a nice
feature to have if you're doing any you
know for troubleshooting any kind of
boot issues much more useful than just
having some troubleshooting LEDs though
you do have those as well so this is
like a quick indicator of what's wrong
this is the look it up in the manual
indicator and you might actually get
something that's more specific than just
oh there's something wrong with the CPU
that this can tell you things like oh
you try two failed memory training or
you failed your GPUs not the motherboard
can't see the GPU you know those kinds
of errors the post code much more
helpful than just some some LEDs like
that so that's a nice feature to have
also have voltage read points up here
you know for people like me who aren't
happy with just having with just having
with your software readouts because
they're not always that accurate these
are just solder bumps so no nice header
but the same like gigabyte is ultimately
gearing most of it like their
motherboards towards gamers not extreme
overclockers so I totally get why
there's not like connectors on that for
multimeter probes but yeah it's you know
at least it's there but much simpler
than then having to like well actually
for me if I'm gonna be soldiering
connectors to the motherboard
I might might as well just solder them
directly behind the CPU socket or
something so at that point it kinda
doesn't matter but if you don't want to
modify the motherboard this is a lot
more convenient than trying to stab the
back of the board with a multimeter
that's generally quite hard to do
especially if you have it on test bench
actually it pretty much impossible if
you have it on test bench we've got a
power button we got a reset button in
the correct location they're also
located on the back but if you remember
some of my past videos with gigabyte
boards I've actually complained that
like why would I want the power button
on the rear i/o if I'm gonna be using
the board on the non test bench so yeah
now we have them in the right location
we've got a we have dual BIOS so a BIOS
selector switch and a BIOS dual BIOS
mode enabled disabled switch
I'm not sure which ones which but
basically you know gigabytes dual BIOS
can be a little bit less than
cooperative when you're doing your when
you're doing memory overclocking and
just failing to boot over and over and
over again it can sometimes get a bit
trigger-happy and go from the main BIOS
to the backup BIOS when you don't need
it so here you can you can force it to
stay on one BIOS for your entire
overclocking session which in my opinion
like that that's really convenient
because the thing is if your BIOS shit
like if it goes from the main BIOS to
the backup while the BIOS profiles are
actually tied to the BIOS chip that
you're using so if you save a bunch of
profiles on the main BIOS and then it
switches to the backup your you don't
have any of your profiles so you'd need
to switch it back over and on a lot of
other words that's like a button to like
on motherboards where you don't have the
switches that's just not possible to do
can be easily so this is a really nice
feature to have on gigabyte motherboards
it's standard for all of their high-end
stuff so no surprise that the the x5 70
master has it but still nice that it's
there we've got our 24 pin some fan
headers debug LEDs going down and
they've kind of ruined the color coding
on the why is that freaking out they've
kind of ruined the color coding on the
front i/o like normally it would be
really colorful and now it's just
grayscale which is a like I preferred it
when it's colorful I could get that it
might look nicer and it's somebody's PC
but it's just like it was easier to to
work with when it was fully color coded
in my opinion I'm pretty much covers all
of the overclock well no we do have a
socketed and so your here's your BIOS
chips your backup BIOS is soldered onto
the board the main BIOS is a socketed so
if you somehow managed to brick both the
backup and the main BIOS you can
potentially just ask gigabyte to send
you a back a new main BIOS chip and
you'll be back up and running so yeah
this is also a nice convenience feature
and other features we have on the
motherboard there's going to be Wi-Fi 6
add-in card right here this is a 2.5 gig
LAN controller from real
Tech if you're like me and you think
real tech sucks there's also a one gig
Intel on down here so you're covered 2.5
g I'm like I haven't used a real tech
network controller in ages and ages and
ages so I don't know how bad it is but
back when I you had a real tech faced
motherboard it was not a good experience
so let's put it that way but that is a
2.5 g and you still have your Intel M so
you know yeah you have options so that
pretty much covers it for the O now that
covers it for this board I mean the only
other thing worth mentioning is that the
x5 70 chip says you can kind of see is a
loss of silicon it gets kind of halt and
if you're doing basically from what I've
been told if you're running em Dell to
SSDs in like a raid zero setup this
thing needs active cooling because it
just gets really really hot when doing
that otherwise it's actually just fine
but raid em dealt to setups are a bit
like they just get hot on that so it's
one of the issues that's actually been
like that's been one of the main issues
with the x5 70 platform is just like
getting that chipsets heat output under
control and eventually that thing that
didn't work like they never managed to
solve the issue of it running really hot
so now it's just like boards have fans
on that but the fan can take care of it
and you know ideally like I'm not sure
about this but I'd hope that the board
has a hybrid fan mode so the fan only
kicks in when it's actually necessary
instead of just all the time no even if
it's spinning all the time as long as
it's not like a super high rpm it should
be relatively ok so yeah that's it for
the x5 70 master from gigabyte the Auris
x5 x5 70 or ass master there finally got
the name I'm still like yeah it's always
gonna be gigabyte for me always it's not
a significantly better magnet name but I
do prefer I I'm used to it at least so
it's the x5 70 master it definitely
looks like a really like I think this is
a this looks like a really solid
motherboard to me quite possibly like it
does everything
like that it kind of does everything the
extreme you know it's a kind of extreme
the extreme adds at the 10 gig line
slightly big well actually not slightly
better VR I'm like it's on a whole new
level of erm but it's just like this is
already so good that I don't really see
like I wouldn't you know push you
towards the extreme just because it's
like oh the arms like way better it is
but it's just you probably won't need it
so yeah but this is definitely a really
really solid x57
you know solid looking x5 70 motherboard
kind of like looking at the master and
the extreme it kind of feels for me like
gigabyte basically what made a checklist
of things I've complained about in the
past when looking at their motherboards
and then they just went and made sure
that there's nothing on that like
nothing has been left unaddressed it's
like builds Lloyd's complained about
this in the past it will not be on our
motherboards anymore because we got the
dual BIOS we like we got everything
solid of erm there's just nothing really
here for me to complain about so yeah
that's it for the video thank you for
watching if you'd like to support gamers
Nexus directly there's stored gamers
Nexus dot I mean there's the gamers
Nexus patreon if you'd like to buy some
gamers Nexus merch there's store dot
gamers Nexus not net and if you'd like
to you know see more content with with
my beautiful boy with my beautiful voice
doing it I have a channel called
actually hardcore overclocking where I
do a whole bunch of overclocking stuff
so yeah that's it for the video thanks
for watching and good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
