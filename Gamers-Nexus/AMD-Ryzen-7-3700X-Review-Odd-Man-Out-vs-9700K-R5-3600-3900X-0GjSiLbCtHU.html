hundred thirty dollars and the 3,800
axes is four hundred currently the i7
9700 case it's between them at just
under four hundred dollars or three
hundred sixty-five dollars on Amazon so
this is a tough place for the 3,700 X to
be it's following up the r5 3600 which
is much cheaper and has many of the same
advantages of the 3700 X and the 3900 X
has more cores and threads and higher
stock clocks the 3600 X 3700 X and 3800
X will all be fighting it for a narrow
slot between AMD's affordable and well
balanced r5 and their high core account
premium chip but today we're reviewing
the r7 3700 X to see where it fits in
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzlies conduct a not
liquid metal conductor not as what we've
used in all of our liquid metal and
delayed thermal tests capable of
dropping cpu thermal significantly and
replacing the stock thermal interface
over cpu thermals don't just allow
better overclocks but also lower noise
levels because the transfer efficiency
is increased the mix of gallium and
indium makes for a thermal conductivity
of 73 watts per meter Kelvin outclassing
traditional pastes significantly learn
more at the link in the description
below with all of AMD's rise and
launches to date there have always been
a few CPUs where it just they don't they
don't quite fit there are other CPUs
that you can overclock to silver
performance if not the same performance
and often get them for cheaper and
that's not to say anything other than
this is a good way of doing product
segmentation and we like that the lower
end chips are still overclocked well you
can often meet those more or less pre
overclocked CPUs like the 2700 to the
2700 x7z hundred to the 1700 X and so
forth and obviously not everyone wants
to overclock anyway so there's use cases
for those x-series chips but the 3700 X
is interesting because we were many
years ago in an era where it was not
uncommon for people including us to say
and i-5 is enough for gaming and now
it's it's sort of flipping and i-5
hasn't been enough for gaming compared
to some of the alternatives lately you
can still game on an i-5 and 9600 K
certainly does far better than its
predecessors with fewer cores but the
point is that these days the frame time
variability is getting high enough on
high five CPUs that we don't feel as
good about recommending them as we might
have maybe six to eight years ago so
it's quite a bit different in terms of
the market the landscape for games has
changed and we're seeing the frame time
performance dip with those i5s and
specific games like there's peculiar
bugs in GTA 5 for example some of the
other games we test you just see the
0.1% and 1% lows dip I my fives but now
an R 5 is in that same position where
it's enough for gaming we saw that with
our five thirty six hundred review it's
a really good CPU and we're very
confident and recommending it so that
then puts the R 5 as one of the primary
competitors to the r7 3700 X for a
gaming machine the 3700 X obviously has
some very clear advantages in production
workloads it's got more threads and so a
lot of things like blender do actually
make use of that so we'll go through all
those numbers today we're going to be
looking at a few things one is should
you just buy an r5 3600 instead if
you're only gaming or well if you're
doing very little non-gaming tasks when
should you buy the ice of a 9700 K which
is a still a big competitor here for the
3700 X and then separately the 3900 acts
of flanking the 3700 X when does that
come into play should you ever just try
and save up and jump to the 3900 X
instead so that's what we're looking
over for additional notes on testing
things we did check our previous reviews
the r5 3600 has more of that notation
before the charts start just a quick
note before we really get into this one
so this review was recorded on Sunday on
launch day and we obviously went back
into the boost testing for the other
video after the review was filmed but
before published so as an update if you
missed it basically what we found was
that changing the bios versions for our
testing did not affect data in fact when
we said the maximum impact was 2.7
percent in GTA 5 we actually went back
later and tested that about 15 more
times for other testing and found that
the difference was reduced to more or
less zero percent so it's like 0.9
percent max not even 2.7 after
additional retesting with another 15 or
so test passes which is enough to
average and call it the actual result so
functionally zero difference
absolutely zero difference to our
production testing which is all core for
the BIOS change so jisub version 1 0 0 2
vs 1 0 0 3 a + 1 0 0 3 a B on our
motherboard with our CPUs our testing
does not impact the data and so that's
your gonna be looking at the data from
the f5c bios which is the one we used
for all these CPUs
maximum impact to the our 5 3600 is 0%
maximum impact to production benchmarks
is 0% maximum impact to gaming is about
1.1 percent now after doing all the
retest again so that's all you need to
know about that and if you want to know
more about the ageia and bios
differences you can watch our previous
video although just know that we went
and retest and even more and found the
differences we're even smaller than
presented there that's what we've got so
let's get it's like gaming benchmarks
we'll look at production stuff as well
and then talk when it's worth it total
war Warhammer two's campaign benchmark
is up first for gaming we'll look at the
more GPU constrained battle benchmark
next there's more room for CPUs to
differentiate themselves in the campaign
benchmark but it's still the same game
and the issues of the battle benchmark
apply here as well the stock 3700
expertly exceeds the performance of the
stock rise in 536 hundred with the 3600
at 155 FPS average and the 3700 X at 158
FPS average stock the difference very
nearly within error margins disabling
that some tea on the 3600 pushes it
above the 3700 X again but we'd still
advise against disabling SMT for actual
use this is just an experiment the
differences between stock versus
overclocked and 3600 vs. 3700 X are
barely there all four of the average
results for the two CPUs with SMT on
fall within a 5 FPS range which is about
16 or more total test passes they are
functionally the same the base clock is
the same for the 3600 and the 3700 X and
the max single core boost is just 200
megahertz higher on the 3700 X so
theoretically any workload that doesn't
use the 3700 X's 16 threads could be
done almost as well on a 3600 and
perhaps even slightly better on a 3600 X
the 3700 X does beat its predecessor the
2700 X by 12% but the stock i7 9700 K by
Intel beats the 3700 X by 11% in this
test not close enough to
call it a serious competition overclock
in the 9700 kay pushes it to 181 FPS
average about 13% ahead of the
overclocks 3700 X currently at $365 on
Amazon but 9700 K is a strong competitor
in the gaming arena it's the same story
at 1440p but with an even tighter range
between the worst 3600 score and the
best 3700 X score there's almost nothing
that makes the 3700 X strongly
preferable to the risin 5 3,600 a CPU
less than two-thirds its price in at
least lightly threaded workloads like
games total war Warhammer - continues
its unique behavior with high core
account CPUs we're moving on to the
battle benchmark next at 1080p with the
8 core 16 thread 3700 X scoring slightly
better than the six core 12 thread 3600
but worse than the 6 core 6 thread 36
hundred thousand T disabled we see some
interesting scaling it makes it tricky
to compare to the rest of the risin
stack since the 12 core 24 thread 3900 X
score is worse than the 3 700 X just
because of SMT overhead still this is a
real game at its exhibiting real-world
performance the stock 9700 K is 6.9
percent ahead of the stock at 3200 X but
overclocked in the 97 RK did not improve
performance this indicates a GPU
bottleneck and the potential for a wider
gap in an unconstrained workload for
example a different game or if he
brought down the graphics settings here
we try to keep our testing as close to
being useful for showing real
differences while not dropping the
settings to be unreasonably low the
campaign benchmark doesn't face this
same constraint as you saw a second ago
and plots this differences closer to 11
to 12 percent the 9700 K also maintains
stronger low performance with one
percent frame x and 0.1% frame x
improved overall in the 9700 k f1 2018
is next giving us traditional DirectX 11
implementation with the codemasters ego
engine all the FPS numbers are big in f1
2018 but that doesn't mean the percent
difference between results has changed
the 3700 axis stock to 78 FPS average is
4% ahead of the 3600 stocks at 267 FPS
average result and the i7 9700 K stock
is 8.8% ahead of the 3700 X ranked at
302 FPS average so far the 3700 X looks
like more of an equivalent in gaming to
the
780 700 K than anything we've tested
from the 9000 series which isn't
necessarily bad but it doesn't read well
on marketing materials the $330 MSRP for
the 3700 X is cheaper than the current
365 dollar price of the 9700 K on Amazon
but it's the closest Intel competitor to
it and the 3800 X which we don't have
yet as for generational improvements the
3700 X beats the 2700 X by 13.9% we
won't be discussing the 3700 X
overclocking much in the games section
of this review because the results are
barely outside of margin of error the
all core 4.3 gigahertz overclock isn't
much of an improvement over stock for
gaming in general and could be even
worse in limited thread workloads but it
was the maximum stable and trying to go
any higher resulted in instability or
shut down the GPU limitations at 1440p
mean that there's barely any difference
whatsoever between the thirty six
hundred and thirty seven hundred X
overclocked or not and the 2700 X isn't
far behind either civilization six is
our next test this one runs with turn
times rather than framerate so we're
looking at how long it takes the CPU to
compute the next AI player action in a
turn-based strategy game the 3700 ax
Falls where it should in the civics
benchmark between the 3600 and the 3900
X results the 97 hard K completed turns
in 30 1.1 seconds average calculated
across five players with four test
passes each and benefited from a 7.8
percent time reduction from the 3700 X
stock versus stock the 3700 exa needed
6.4 percent less time than the stock
3600 that puts the 3700 x encouragingly
close to intel on one side and
discouragingly close to AMD and the cpu
tooth years below it on the other side
it does reduce turn times by 10.1
percent versus the stock 2700 x
Assassin's Creed is the best opportunity
to see CPUs differentiate themselves
based on core count before we get into
workstation benchmarks we found
Assassin's Creed origins to have the
best balance between core and frequency
dependencies in our gaming test so it's
good for that even then the 3,700 X only
exceeds the our 536 hundreds average FPS
marked at 119 to 115 FPS average
53.9% and the 2700 x is stock 107 FPS
average is exceeded by 11.5% based on
our experience with Assassin's
during this round of testing those may
be the most quote normal numbers on
which to base expectations for the other
games we test the 9700 K is 17.1% the
head of the 3700 acts here all stock or
18 percent when both are overclocked
although note that we are beginning to
reach the top and with the 9700 K where
GP limitations may begin to exist as
usual 1440p results behave like 1080p
but with a smaller range of results
thanks to limitations outside of the CPU
that puts the 3700 acts even closer to
the 3600 in performance and the 3700
acts
closer to the 9700 K although Intel's
chip is still good l haven't presented
ahead even with the GPU bottlenecks
closing it GTA 5 is next another dx11
title that's still wildly popular as a
game that cares more about frequency
than threads and all modern CPUs we've
tested GTA 5 doesn't break from the
trend by once again putting the 3700 X
only about 4.8% ahead of the 3600 or 109
FPS average vs. 104 FPS average and the
9700 K is 122 FPS average is 11.8% ahead
of the 3700 X the generational
improvement over the 2700 acts is about
16% a bit better than in the other tests
for what that's worth this is another
instance where the 3700 axis results are
much more competitive with last gens i7
8700 K than the modern night 700 K and
there are 5 3600 is more compelling from
a value angle than the 3700 axes GTA 5
at 1440p continues to scale cleanly from
1080p with barely any change in fps
numbers between the two tests this
indicates that we remain largely
cpu-bound with our settings so this is a
more perfect environment for comparison
so even if playing at higher resolutions
you'll still see the CPUs impact
framerate you can't fully escape that
the GPU isn't always the bottleneck even
with those higher limits a high
resolution
limitations Shadow the Tomb Raider at
DirectX 12 title is next and becomes GP
limited towards the top bounds of the
results the 9700 K is one of those CPUs
near the upper bounds it's still about
17% ahead of the 3700 X and average FPS
so it doesn't seem to be too limited
3700 X only beats its 6 core 12 thread
r5 3600 sibling by 3.3 percent in this
test which is pretty lean even compared
to the already small performance gap in
the other games so far and it's only 7%
past the 2700 x1 last game in benchmark
to fully and complete
we beat this dead horse and hit man 2
using direct x12 the 3,700 access 2.7
percent better than the r5 3600 ranked
at 118 FPS average versus 115 FPS
average 14 percent better than the 2700
acts and the united 700k is 18.8% better
than the 3700 ex in gaming the
generational improvements are good the
improvements over the lower part of the
product stack are bad and the
competition with the 9700 K is rough to
non-existent game is only half of our CP
been sweet so we're not saying the 3700
is a bad CPU just that it doesn't match
up to and these chosen competitor and
gaming performance quite as well as a
MIDI might like and more importantly
that the r5 3600 chips away mower at the
3700 X's proposition for gaming than
perhaps anything else does and it's a
lot cheaper
moving into production benchmarks next
we can start looking at how the 3700 X
compares to the 3600 and the 3900 X and
V ray renderer by chaos group we have
some other benchmarks to this benchmark
is measured in time required to render
so lower is better and these are our
seven 3700 X finishes the render in 1.0
nine minutes when stock in 1.0 four
minutes when overclocked to 4.3
gigahertz a marginal improvement of just
four point six percent the ro933 ender
in a massive 31 percent faster time in
0.75 minutes instead of 1.09 the r7 3700
X finishes the render 25% faster than
the r5 3600 CPU on both our stock
posting more noteworthy improvements
than a lot of the games would otherwise
show where the r5 3600 might be an easy
choice where's the 3700 x4 gaming
systems that the 3700 X does prove value
for this type of work look Adobe
Photoshop is next for this one we
already know that Photoshop refers
frequency over all else which is
something that we always demonstrate by
highlighting the 5.1 gigahertz 900km
9700 k results at near equivalence
despite the double thread count on the
9900 K as for the 3700 X the stock CPU
score is 10 18 points in our benchmark
basically tied with the all core
overclock because some tests in this
application are limited thread loads
overclocking is typically worse or
ineffective versus stock the 3900 X doc
CPU scores 1053 points an improvement of
just 3.4 percent it's not worth the 3900
X for only Photoshop although the story
changes for premiere later for this
workload if Photoshop is the only thing
you do
or you do it professionally it's
probably best to stick to higher
frequency intel parts for the current
generation even the 9600 K at 5.1
gigahertz highlights the lack of
usefulness for threads in this workload
and that's another point to show the
frequency requirement by Photoshop Kanu
compiler collection is next this is a
compile workload that is functionally a
cache benchmark and Rises victim cache
combined with high cache quantities
upwards of 32 megabytes out three on the
3600 alone means that it finishes the
compiles significantly faster than other
parts as stated before we can't
represent all types of code compiled in
one charge so this one will primarily or
only apply to those using this type of
GCC with cygwin or m62 and mingw
environments so r7 3,700 x does just as
well as the 3900 X and results are
within error margins both have the same
cache and so we learned the limitations
of this particular benchmark are related
to l3 cache for cash in general and not
core count or as the 9900 k illustrates
clock speeds 7-zip is next for this one
we're looking at seven zip compression
results first then we'll look at
decompression the test is to see how
many millions of instructions per second
each CPU can manage while dealing with
compressing or decompressing files the
r7 3,700 X scores 74,000 MIPS 1 stock
with an overclock under 1% better not
really worth it generationally the r7
3,700 X stock Seaview outperforms the
previous gen our 727 and X by a notable
26% and the r7 1700 a 3.9 gigahertz
basically a 1700 X overclocking them got
them to about the same frequency by a
massive 48% improvement versus the first
gen rising processors compared to end
how the closest to the 3700 axes the
9900 ka 5.2 gigahertz which is more
expensive and does require an OC
although to be fair into overclocking is
much more effective than AMD
overclocking and this test and basically
all others it's just that Andy's got a
strong lead anyway for decompression and
these are seven 3,700 X stock CPU runs
at 96 thousand MIPS roughly with an
overclock giving us an improvement of
two I understand it's better than
compression but still not worth the loss
of higher boosts on one core the 3900 X
has a massive improvement of almost 50%
over the 3700 X stock to stock which is
thanks to the higher core account if
working heavily and daily with
compression and decompression even
though it's almost $200 more expense
the r9 3900 ax is worth serious
consideration a 50% increase in
performance is something that will
affect daily use meaningfully for
everyone else the 3700 ax is a fine
middle ground part this is more easily
justified against the 3600 than in
gaming although the 3600 is the best in
its price class and we strongly
recommend it the 3700 X does have
meaningful uplift here blender gives us
another popular usage environment with
3d modelers and animators and one to
2.79 with our custom-made monkey heads
render the 3700 X ends up a bit faster
than the 9900 K stock CPU completing the
render in 7% last time
although overclocked in the 9900 K does
put it back in the lead the 3900 X leads
the 3700 significantly halt thanks to
thread dependencies in this workload
finishing in 32% last time at twelve
point eight minutes versus the 2700 X
doc CPU the generational improvement to
the 3700 X is a reduction from 23
minutes to 19 or about 20% for reference
the 3600 stocks he finishes the render
in 25 minutes so again there's a large
difference between these two and thread
bound workloads particularly popular in
the non-gaming segment the GN logo
rendered positions the 3700 x stock cpu
at 23 minutes about 5 minutes faster
than the stock 27 an X or 18 percent and
6 minutes faster than the overclocked r7
1700 x 3.9 gigahertz where Andy started
losing ground to the 1900 K when it
first launched shown were the 9900 a
stock performance outperforms even the
overclocks 2700 X although AMD always
had a cost argument now with the 3700 X
Andy has both the cost and the
performance arguments in favor for a
blender adobe premier is another Adobe
application that often likes frequency
but unlike Photoshop it does actually
make use of the threats that's why the
3175 ex showed meaningful uplift in our
review of the 28 core CPU for this
one-hour 1080p60 Eng and convention
report renders in 3.8 minutes with the
3,700 X operated in conjunction with
CUDA as all these results do for a
Youtube upload it's it's good I mean
it's faster which ties it with the 9900
K overall overclocking does not improve
the results for the 3700 acts at all
overclocking the 9900 K gets it about 5%
to uplift ahead of the 3700 X with the
3900 acts leading both by a meaningful
margin it's easy to compare the 9900 K
to the 3700 X here just because they're
close to each other on the chart but
reality is the 3,700 acts is a lot
cheaper at $330 versus the raw 485 to
$500 price range of the 9900 K at
overclocked 297 30 K is probably the
closest price comparison that still
meaningfully competes with a 3700 X at
that point you might as well just buy
the 2500 X from last gen with our 4k
render the 3700 X doc CPU ends up at
eleven point two minutes ahead of the
1900 KS stock CPU and I 700k overclocked
CPUs and behind the RO 9:30 to 900 X the
3900 acts is really the one that
surprised us in this test we weren't
expecting to see the 9900 KD throned and
premiere by a comparatively priced part
in a few ways this review and similarly
to the r5 3600 of you AMD is not really
a match directly fourth chose an Intel
competitor the 9700 K that's the one
that AMD shows itself against in most
cases and some games we're looking at
18% leads for the 9700 K and that varies
a bit depending on the GPU bottleneck
but even we're bottlenecked
it's still in the lead and so even if
you get an extra 25 megahertz back with
some different update to BIOS although
we were more or less at the boost tree
it seems to vary chip to chip and I
guess we can explore that later if we
need to but we knew about this issue for
a while for a couple days now the
content was mostly content complete
though and the BIOS updates didn't
really seem to have a whole lot of
impact on how our 3600 was was boosting
but anyway the point is the 90s 500k has
a pretty reasonable lead in gaming only
applications and that's not going to
change a whole lot so if all conditions
are the same if you overclock memory on
rise and sure it'll improve but it will
on Intel as well so all things equal if
you're only gaming the 9700 still in a
good position but you've got the the
additional performance
headroom in things like production tasks
blender we see improvements in premiere
now that we weren't expecting with AMD
chips the new ones and if you're doing
anything like that in addition to gaming
as we've said with some of the other
CPUs the 3700 acts become something
worth considering but it's not like the
r5 3600 with the 3600 we more or less
give it a clean sweep when for the
purchase in its price category of $200
you could get a 9600 K
it's definitely performs better and
gaming workloads by a bit but the jumps
aren't that big and at that price
category you shave a bit off the price
of what a 9600 K costs you dodge the
variability of 1% 0.1% Louis or frame
times that are mixed results by using
the 3600 so it's that was more or less a
clean sweep with a 3900 X we came to the
conclusion of if you do in production
this thing's pretty great and it's a
good solution for most production
applications now there's some that stand
out like Photoshop which is frequency
bound but for the most part the 3900
acts especially things like compression
decompression blender for premiere not
Photoshop a premiere surprisingly did
really well in all those and so for
those applications we can make a pretty
good recommendation for a lower-cost h
EDT part because that's basically the
gap that it's filling in the market for
gaming at that price point the 9900 case
still better for Photoshop it's still
better so that review was more of an it
depend scenario the 3700 X review ends
with basically if you're spending the
amount of money would on a 3700 X you've
got on one end the 3600 and then on the
other end the 900 K or the 3900 X and so
the 3700 falls in this weird middle
ground if you're spending more than you
would for an r5 3600 at $200 for a
gaming focus build it probably best to
go for a 9700 K if you're stepping down
in price we'd say go for the r5 3600 the
r7 3700 X is tough to justifying gaming
workloads and doesn't quite fit in as
cleanly as the 3600 and the 3600 X might
even outperform it in some because of
the boosting behavior where it can boost
higher with more limited thread count we
need to look at that when it comes out
but it becomes easier to justify the
3700 acts as a cheaper solution for
production tasks for pure gaming we
continue to recommend at this point the
Intel CPUs in this price bracket the 97
K has come down a bit recently and for
any additional tasks like video
production that can make use of more
cores and these are r7 is the better
choice and like the r5 3600 the r7 3700
X shows a respectable improvement over
its 2000 series predecessors in gaming
that makes it even more attractive for
or maybe a streamer compared to the rest
of the rise in 3000 stack though we'd
probably only recommend the 3,700 acts
in a choice against the 3,800 X but we
can't be certain without benchmarking it
we can however predict based on our
seven three hundred versus 1800 X and
2700 versus 2700 decks testing that that
would be true otherwise the 3600 has the
edge in price and the 3900 X has the
edge in performance so 3200 X it's not
like it's a bad CPU it just doesn't
quite have as strong of a recommendation
as a 3600 it's got real competition from
Intel and it's in a weird middle ground
and we don't typically like recommending
weird middle ground products because
there's really things that are very good
at what they're targeted at on either
side and so the 3700 X is it's just a
bit it's the odd man out for this one so
that's it for this review I think we've
I think we've covered most of the
products that have been available to us
we're working on more coming up we're
hoping to do a liquid nitrogen stream at
some point maybe this week hopefully so
check back for that stay tuned on
Twitter to get updates on that at gamers
Nexus you got a store that cameras
access net to support us directly by
picking up one of our tool kits for
example which was one under here
somewhere or you can pick up one of the
mod mats thanks for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
