donna and today we're looking at intel's
new skylake platform and the codename
skylake cpus this includes the core i7
6700 k and the core i5 6600 k which take
on more familiar naming to the older
generations
intel has presently dropped the XX 70
brandon as in the 4770k and the 6700 k
is effectively the replacement to the
4790k The Devil's Canyon chip which was
an overclocked replacement to the 4770k
now in between those was another chip
called Haswell refresh so Intel released
three different versions of Haswell with
similar SKUs for the last two years or
so and this is very uncharacteristic of
Intel they generally sort of put out
their top-of-the-line flagship for any
particular architecture in this case has
well and then they just let it sit they
put out a couple by threes i fives in
between they might put out a new II
platform like haswell-e Ivy bridge-e so
forth but this time there were two
refreshes in between Haswell refresh and
Devil's Canyon and then there's the
shift to skylake architecture so this is
the new architecture and also
uncharacteristic of Intel and somewhat
odd for the industry is the coinciding
release of Broadwell which has been
discussed for quite a while now a number
of years and that's finally here as well
but today we're looking at skylake the
more interesting platform in my opinion
skylake has ddr4 and ddr3 support and
this is something that until this point
has only been offered on x99 platforms
so ddr4 may feel a little bit stale for
this reason because it's been around now
it's in x99 but this is actually an
important advancement for intel on the
consumer side because skylake is a
little bit more affordable than the x99
offerings including the five hundred and
thousand dollar CPUs the 59 30k 59 60 X
so ask I like the memory capabilities
include both ddr3l and ddr4 that means
that at the motherboard manufacturers
discretion they may choose one of those
two platforms for memory and put it on
the board our board used DDR
for there are ddr3l boards out there as
well and those will bring cost down
considerably for users who are
considering the option of skylake CPUs
so let's go through the specs of the i7
6700 K&amp;amp;I 560 600 K before we get into
the gaming benchmarks the core and
thread count is the same as previously
you've got four cores eight threads for
the 6700 k that means it is hyper
threaded and the 6600 K has four cores
four threads so it is not hyper threaded
the 6700 K is clocked at four gigahertz
and the 6600 K clocked at 3.5 gigahertz
pretty familiar to the 4770 and 4670 and
then of course the X 90 versions of
those Devils cannon were clocked a
little bit higher so there is more of a
game there less of a difference between
skylake and DC then skyleigh can as well
the IGP is the HD 530 something we
haven't yet tested I will be doing a
separate article and video on that when
we have the graphics drivers properly
installed they were not installed in
time for launch unfortunately but it is
the HD 530 and then the TDP is slightly
increased over Haswell base at 91 watts
so very minor increase but this is in
step with Devil's Canyon and it
basically means that there's more G's
provided to allow for the higher clock
rate which is what we see in skylight so
the new chipset for the skylight
platform is z170 there will very likely
be more chipsets there's normally an H
series and only other Z series options
as well as the device and platform and
everything matures but right now it's
z170 and that's what we tested on z170
has a couple of major additions again
the first big item on note 4 the
architecture of the CPU and the support
of the chipset is ddr4 memory and this
has a hidden cost to it so although the
cpus are priced very similarly to what
they were in the past for their
succeeded skews the added cost of ddr4
can drive the price of a build up
considerably depending on what you're
building and and how much you're looking
to spend on your memory the next biggest
change for z170 is the increase in peace
Express Lanes so z1 70-plus skylake
offers a total of 36 PCIe lanes those
are all 3.0 and to put things into
perspective the previous Haswell
offerings with the z97 z87 chipset
were limited to just 24 lanes and some
of those were PCIe gen 2 so this is
actually a pretty big deal because at 24
lanes you can't get a full dual GPU by
16 setup going now for things we'll
discuss in future videos that's not
super relevant because the GPUs really
won't saturate that full bandwidth
anyway they'll be just fine at by 8 but
you can't get the dual by 16s and
perhaps more relevant is a dual GPU
setup + + SSD using a PCIe slot or PCIe
lanes which is done through the MDOT -
SSDs that are out now they generally
consume four PCIe lanes sometimes by 4
and sometimes by 2 so when you have a
setup like that you're instantly
exceeding the Lane availability of has
well and z87 z97 with skylake at 36
lanes you could have 2 by 16 video cards
and a by 4 SSD and you'll be consuming
all the lanes but you will be fine and
probably won't have to multiplex really
at all or at least not heavily if you do
and then if you're doing a three-way GPU
setup it's again pretty allowing in that
regard because you can do by by by 4 and
then you can even have another device or
by 16 by 8 by 4 whatever and you can
have another SSD in there and you're not
going to run into the lane issues that
you would have on Haswell so that is a
big deal but it's something that will
test separately in a very in-depth
article and video on the lane
scalability of skylake systems the final
update here is that USB 3.0 has 4 more
native supported ports for z170 so not a
big deal but that brings it up to 10
from 6 on z87 z97 there are other
architectural changes as well but check
out the article for that and let's just
dive straight into the gaming benchmarks
here first of all this system is our
test bench for skylake now to test the
other CPU
we obviously had to use other benches
because of the platform difference so
the benches are detailed on the website
there were three used AMD the Intel z97
option and then the z170 option here
this is the more interesting one to talk
about this was provided by iBUYPOWER
it's a full system we'll be reviewing
separately but the cpu in here is an i7
6700 K it's got a z170 chipset on an
asrock k6 fatality motherboard which I
think we have another video online
discussing that motherboard and then
we've got some memory in here as well
it's got 16 gigabytes of G skills new
ddr4 memory so this was provide by
iBUYPOWER and it was our test platform
we do not currently have a 6600 K but
that is something I will be
investigating in the immediate future
for the GPU this used a gtx 980ti which
is something we used in our 7870 k
benchmark recently the a-10 APU
benchmark and the reason we're using
this GP is because it's our fastest
single GPU solution without going to a
Titan X and that means that we're
hopefully forcing more of a cpu
bottleneck in these benchmarks because
we're really desperately trying to avoid
a GPU bottleneck when we're looking at
CPU performance in games the rest of the
test methodology is described on the
website let's get to the benchmarks here
this test strictly looks at gaming that
performance will visit the power
thermals and overclocking stuff in more
detail later
there is almost no measurable gain over
a Haswell Devil's Canyon or even the
aging 35 70 K Ivy Bridge CPU and that's
shown here in most of these games in
grid there's a slight gain for skylake
in the witcher and actually shadow of
Mordor there's an interesting disparity
where most of the time and any time
outside of margin of error we found that
the Haswell chips performance better
than skylake for the the a thread model
so why does that happen well it's
actually sort of interesting it's
because of the ddr4 memory so even
though we have increased the bandwidth
for ddr4 and increased capabilities for
people like video editors you do
actually lose some ground in latency and
that's because the cast timings of ddr4
are significantly slower than ddr3 this
is not really
to memory this happened when we moved
from ddr2 to DDR 3 as well DDR wanted a
year two things slow down as bandwidth
increases but hopefully you get
something that outweighs it now in the
case of these tests the difference
between the ddr4 and ddr3 performance is
so minor that it is almost immeasurable
we had to run the test about 10 times in
order to collect enough data to be
confident that there was in fact a
disparity and that's just that's how
small the difference was it was one FPS
or less on average and the reason for
that is the cache timings on this
g.skill memory it's about 15 for the
slowest timing and on ddr3 or might be
closer to 9 so that's actually a pretty
big difference in terms of percentage
Delta for the millisecond latency and
that's where I believe we're seeing this
difference because that will impact IPC
and things like that which some games
that are more heavily dependent on
memory will exhibit this this outcome
which shadow of mordor is one of them
and certainly the witcher 3 is one of
them now it's not too critical because
the difference again is pretty small but
it's something interesting and fun to
talk about so I wanted to bring that up
moving on to the other games that you
see that for the most part there is
really no measurable advantage for
skylake over the recent CPUs all the way
down to Ivy Bridge I do not have a Sandy
Bridge CD for testing unfortunately
overclocking was limited but we have
engineering samples so I'll have to
retest this as we update the BIOS the
firmware things like that and get it all
up to production level bios so hopefully
that will increase our overclocking
abilities but you can see on this chart
the achieved overclocking output in our
testing I was limited to about 4.6
gigahertz on skylake really not super
impressive I think it should be more but
I'm skeptical of the pre production
board and CPU so we'll update these
engineering samples and hopefully get
some retail samples and then I'll let
you guys know via video and article how
it over clocks in the full version
overall skylake is not a bad CPU just
like Haswell was not a bad CPU iberia
just not a bad CPU but none of them are
particularly impressive in the face of
their immediate predecessor and that
remains
true with skylake so skylake these 6700
K is stand-alone it could CPU it does
what it should do it's fast and there's
really not much of a downside against
the previous generation but it's also
not a huge advancement in terms of raw
gaming performance so if you are on
Sandy Bridge Ivy Ridge has well Devil's
Canyon has well refresh then there's
really no reason to jump from same skew
it's the same skew on skylake there's no
reason for you to go from a 2700 K to
his 6700 K for the most part if you're
just gaming if you're doing production
tasks then it becomes more desirable
because now you've got ddr4 and you have
more lanes and for production heavy
systems that is certainly something that
is worth considering but for gamers if
you're on has well Ivy Bridge whatever
Sandy Bridge then jumping to sky lake
will not produce a really measurable
gain in your gaming performance you
might get a couple of FPS at very best
but the money would likely better be
spent on something else like gen SSD or
a better GPU or something like that
the thing with skylake is that it's got
ddr4 memory and that's a hidden cost so
that's the one area where I would advise
system builders working on a new
computer to either look at a sky like
ddr3 option or some other CPU basically
platform but if ddr4 cost isn't a
concern to you if you think you'll get
use out of it then certainly skylake is
really not a bad implementation of that
x99 is going to be faster if you're
using the high-end x99 chip with ddr4
for production tasks because you've got
quad channel you've got the ddr4 memory
as this has and then you've also got the
additional lanes of a production class
CPU so for premiere users Photoshop
users people like that who are doing
this professionally working with these
applications batch processing all day
long then x99 it should still be your
go-to if it is within budget but if
you're more of an enthusiast hobbyist
then skylake is not a bad way to go so
that is all for this skylake review
check the article for full details and
the description below and then I'll be
back shortly with over
talking with an AMD APU review of the
7870 k it's already published on the
website if you want to jump ahead of me
and check that out and then we've got
some other front articles that were
working on as well especially those with
lane scalability and GPS which is more
of my specialty as many of you know so
