hardcore overclocking and today we're
taking a look at this thing which
doesn't have a name as far as I'm aware
but this is one of the boards that was
used for the 28 core unlocked
overclockable Zeon demo that in well not
much of a demo with more more
distraction from thread Ripper 2 but
yeah I don't know what they're actually
planning if this is going retail or
anything but we are gonna take a look at
this board because it is insane and huge
thanks to Paul from Paul's hardware for
actually sending in the pictures of this
because this is one very very special
motherboard right here so before we get
into the erm actually now let's start
with the VR I'm because that's really
the highlight of the this this entire
thing this giant line of phases up here
is the VCC in before that this video is
brought to you by the cable mod vertical
GPU adapter a universal kit that lets
you add a vertical GPU amount to almost
any enclosure the vertical GPU adapter
positions video cards further back from
the glass than most stock vertical GPU
mounts aiding in thermals and also
easily sockets into the PCIe expansion
slots of compatible cases the adapter
kit is brand new and makes it easy to
show off video cards even in cases that
don't include a stock vertical GPU mount
learn more at the link in the
description below and I'm not gonna
count these out here because there is 28
of them and it would take a while but so
this is a 28 phase as far as the
inductors and the power stages go so you
have 20 inductors and you have 28 power
stages but I do not know if it actually
interleaves 28 phases on this side of
the board there are evidently no
quadruple errs but they may be located
on the back of the board I just don't
know if it does run quadruple errs then
it'll be International rectifier $35.99
s because those are a really small
compact quadrupling chip that works with
international rectifier parts very very
well-liked technically speaking you can
use it with other chips as well but if
you're using international rectifier
power stages and Internet
and an IR voltage controller then it
just makes sense to go with IR quadruple
errs
so the voltage controller is this chip
right here which is a three five two
zero four one and that is it goes up to
eight phases
it supports plus two as an option so you
can also run it as a plus one but it has
to stay eight phases total so you can do
like a 6 plus 2 or a 6 or 7 plus 1 and
you can of course do any phase count
lower than that here it is configured
for a 7 plus a zero and then I don't
know about the the quadrupling situation
now the actual power stages in the vrm
right here are international rectifier
35:56 is now these are not the most
powerful power stages that you can buy
from international rectifier these are
just 50 amps whereas they do make a 55
55 35 55 which is a 60 amp part but
gigabyte has seemingly a huge amount of
35:56 is because they've been using them
on high-end boards since x99 so i assume
they just bought like a ton of them in
bulk and they've been just and and so
they just use them everywhere for their
high-end boards and you know it's really
not a problem that this is just a 50 amp
part when you have 28 phases though
interestingly enough this crazy phase
count is not the highest phase count
with the most powerful power stage that
even gigabyte has made gigabyte has
actually in the past made a motherboard
with the 32 phase V core and 35 55 or
the 35 to 55 s predecessor which was the
35 50 I'm not 100% certain about that
right now but so this isn't the highest
phase count motherboard that gigabyte
has ever made but it is the most
powerful vrm that gigabyte has ever put
on a board and the reason is simple
because while they did make a 32 phase
vrm in the past and that was a z77 board
so yeah that's right gigabyte decided
that a 4 core Intel i7 3737 70 K really
needed a 32 phase of erm with 60 amp
hour stages but nonetheless that we are
is actually weaker than this one for a
very very simple reason in order to
accommodate that one onto an ATX
motherboard gigabyte had 16 phases on
one side of the board and then on the
other backside of the board they had
another 16 phases so you basically had a
power stage PCB power stage sandwich
which is completely uncool about if you
actually want to use the full capacities
of each of the power stages because each
power stage at 60 amps output would
produce around 12 watts of heat and
basically you'd have a little 2400 watt
you know 24 watt heater sandwiching the
the PCB in this footprint and there was
since half the vrm was on the back of
the board there's only a heatsink on the
other side and it would be completely
uncool about which is why on this board
you know you get the monstrous heatsink
right here but also why the vrm is
actually like crammed onto the same size
like it is here because there have been
boards where they've done twenty eight
phases twenty four phases twenty eight
phases thirty-two phases it's been done
before but it's never actually been done
in a functional way where the board
could actually max out all of its phases
it was done more as a you know but
basically as a marketing stunt where
it's like hey there's 32 phases on here
they're not actually that powerful
because of their thermal density but
there is 32 of them but this does work
the this is that this is fully capable
of powering the monstrosity that is a 28
core Xeon CPU with an unlocked
multiplier because that's exactly like
that's pretty much what Intel's done
here and the thing is so you have the
28th core Xeon and the the easy
comparison here is the 14 core I nine so
I have a seven 940 X and I've already
tested it you know I've been chucked it
for Cinebench and a bunch of other
benchmarks and I know for a fact that if
you're running Cinebench 15 on the 14
core at say 4.8 gigahertz which my chip
is not the best there are chips out
there that'll do 5 gigahertz at the
voltage that mine needs 4 4.8 but for 4
point
gigahertz I need 1.3 5 volts at which
point my chip consumes for 540 watts
from the power connectors and we will
get to those eventually so my chip uses
540 watts for 4.8 gigahertz 1.3 5 volts
now it is possible that Intel bend these
eons like crazy to get a chip that does
5 gigahertz at 1.2 volts
however I would like to point out that
the probability of you having like the
probability of every single core on a 28
core CPU being able to do 4.8 gigahertz
well 5 gigahertz at say 1.3 volts is a
lot lower than 8 on a 14 core CPU just
because you have more cores so the the
probability that this CPU was actually
running 5 gigahertz at a reasonable
voltage very very unlikely but until I
heard about the chiller I thought until
I actually got away with that but now
Intel inde adult water cooling and the
thing is that means they were definitely
pushing unreasonable amounts of voltage
the other thing is Cinnabons 15 on a 28
core CPU clocked to 5 gigahertz finishes
so fast that it's not really much of a
stress test like the fact that you
finished Cinebench is really not much of
an achievement when it takes a couple
seconds so the so for the demo systems
the CPUs were probably pushing somewhere
you know if we go with the 28 core up
here for let's say if it just what you
know if it just scaled up from my 14
core then we're talking about 1080 watts
of power but if we went with say 5
gigahertz and a voltage bump to
something that you know it like that
this would possibly be what it was
configured to unfortunately there's not
much information on you know the
configuration well 5 gigahertz one point
4 volts you'd be looking at around 1200
watts which you know not a huge jump in
power draw but still a hell of a lot of
power now if you ran something like
prime95 you'd be looking at actually
like 20% or even
percent more power than what Cinebench
does because Cinebench really isn't that
heavy because it doesn't use AVX
instructions acceleration and yeah and
also it finishes quickly so the the five
gigahertz Cinebench demo wasn't really
that you know biggest stress test here
nonetheless the vrm you need is
absolutely insane and the thing is you
could probably get away with 1200 watts
on something smaller than this so maybe
they were running even more voltage than
that it's really hard to say like
there's no information on these systems
and and so but we are definitely talking
about power draw numbers in excess of a
thousand watts if they had managed to
bend something that did five gigahertz
1.2 volts you could probably see it
doing around 800 watts but well at least
for Cinebench under prime95 it would
still hit a thousand but with the fact
that they ended up using a chiller I'm
inclined to believe that they didn't get
a you know uber gold CPU which does five
G on one point two volts which with the
high core count is extremely unlikely
so this vrm has to push a crazy amount
of power and so let's go over how it
actually does doing that so since the 28
core Xeon uses the fully integrated
voltage regulator which is basically a
very very high frequency buck converter
built directly into the silicon of the
CPU and optimized for basically
converting two volts into well
converting your core vault like the the
conversion it's good for is basically a
600 milli volt drop or like a 500 milli
volt drop it's not really like it's not
a fully-fledged it's not super flexible
it really doesn't like doing big voltage
drops or very small voltage drops its
optimized very specifically for a
certain range and if you go outside that
range the CPUs behave weirdly but
basically for the convenient for
convenience sake I'm going to assume
that the entire
VCC n was two volts because it makes my
life simpler also because the datasheet
actually ends at 2 volts so if you go
beyond that you you get a mess and two
volts for one point 4 volts 3 core is
actually acceptable even for 1 point 3 5
volts peak or it is a reasonable voltage
to run you probably actually want to run
a bit more than that
but nonetheless 2 volts has to get so
all of this this crazy amount of power
has to get out of this VR I'm at 2 volts
and that leads to some insane current
draw figures so starting at the 600 amps
that the demo system might have been
pushing for Cinebench we're talking
about a vrm heat dissipation of about 77
watts this heatsink starts making a lot
of sense though honestly this heatsink
looks big enough to cool a CPU and this
vrm would probably do that 600 amps so
well not necessarily fully passive but
with a some airflow you know it would
should not have a problem with that
because this is huge and it has a
massive power plane sitting behind it so
that this all this empty space but here
that all acts basically as a heat sink
for the power stages so 600 amps we're
talking 77 watts thanks to CPU right
there now 800 amps which you know let's
say prime95 or if you got more
unreasonable cooling than a water
chiller than 800 amps definitely
achievable you know we've seen the we've
seen the 18 core CPU do a thousand watts
on liquid nitrogen so 800 amps output
for this vrm on on let's say well I
think dry ice you'd probably be looking
at dry ice because phase-change cooling
would run into some major issues with
just the amount of heat that these that
28 core Xeon would put out it would
overload
basically most phase-change coolers that
I've seen obviously like it would
basically require somebody to build a
very very big custom unit that as far as
I'm aware nobody has anything in the
power capacity that 28 core Xeon would
need so 800 amps you'd be looking at
about 125 watts of heat
coming out of the VRM and a thousand
amps at which point you know the at this
point the the power supply starts being
a problem because you know to 2 volts
thousand amps output we're talking about
what to more than 2,000 watts coming
into the VRM as it would produce about
175 watts of heat so you'd be looking at
like 2200 watts input power that would
overload every PSU ever like that well
maybe not some of the crazy mining
specialist you know mining only power
supplies but any normal power supply
well normal super flower has built a
2000 watt power supply for the European
market before the mining craze well this
would still overload that so one thing I
do wonder about this vrm is with this
power connector arrangement where they
have two of them up here and two of them
down here I do wonder and also you know
separate input filtering chokes I do
wonder if the power plane for this vrm
is split and by split I basically mean
that half the vrm gets okay that's not
half is it it's really hard to guess
we're half on this thing is because it's
so big but half the vrm would be getting
12 volts from one from one set of power
connectors and the other side would be
getting 12 volts from the other set of
power connectors which on a motherboard
that's actually not normal on GPUs your
8 pin and your 6 pin should not be in
parallel but on motherboards europe
various cpu power connectors are
generally going to be in parallel in
fact having them I've not seen a
motherboard where they're where they're
different power planes but here having
them on different power planes would
make a ton of sense as it would mean
that you can run two power supplies in
parallel for this thing which you'd want
to because you need to source in two
thousand watts of power for the CPU the
other thing is I'm not aware of any
power supplies with two eight four eight
pin power connectors for four-seat like
480 PS eight pin power connectors so
this board might actually feature dual
PSU compat capabilities and built into
it which that's a pretty cool feature in
my opinion
and I actually asked about I actually
asked if ROG was considering doing that
for regular X 299 since X 299 is or any
kind of capable of like tripping over
current protection unlike a 1200 watt
power supply but here here it's not
really optional in my opinion like if if
you want to really hammer one of these
MOT CPUs when overclocking you're gonna
need two power supplies cuz they don't
make anything bigger than 2,000 watts
and these CPUs could pull more than that
anyway so 1000 amps 175 watts of heat
this heat sink the the this heatsink you
know keeps showing why it why it's this
big and then for a thousand two hundred
amps which technically speaking these
are 50 amp power stages so you should be
able to push 50 amps through every
single one of them assuming this
heatsink is able able to keep up I'm
gonna but I don't think it is able to
keep up because at 1200 amps you'd be
looking at 250 watts of heat output
that's like a GPU right there that's
like an entire graphics card this seems
to be in the same size as a GPU heatsink
you know but I wouldn't really like so
past this point I wouldn't really want
to go because as you can clearly see the
scale like the the power increase gets
bigger and bigger going from each of
these values so from like 70 from 77
watts to 125 that's about 50 watts then
from 125 to a 775 that's about 50 watts
and then past this point it actually
gets nonlinear well it it's never linear
but it starts really ramping up as you
go from 175 to 250 and then from 250
you'd be looking at like over 300 watts
for the next 200 amps so at around 1200
amps I'd say is the limit for this erm
and 2 volts that per do you know that
translates into about 2400 watts of
power capability now the 28 core should
actually get to that at least not
continuously it might spike to that but
it shouldn't be able to pull 2400 watts
sustained partly because of cooling
concerns but partly also like if you
just assumed that you didn't have
cooling issues if you looked at the 18
core the 18 core wouldn't like the the
eight you if you had a 36 core right
you could you could maybe hit 2400 well
now like 2,000 watts average this is not
a 36 core this is a 28 so it shouldn't
actually you know it shouldn't be a UH I
shouldn't actually get even necessarily
well 2,000 watts it might be able to hit
but above that def I I would be very
very skeptical and actually even 2,000
watts would be hard to hit because the
the 18 core maxes out at around a
thousand watts for liquid nitrogen
overclocking and so you know this isn't
Plus like this isn't literally twice an
18 core it's more like 55 percent more
than an 18 core so realistically even on
liquid nitrogen you're probably going to
land in a current output somewhere in
between these two so it's not like the
this vrm is it is ridiculously powerful
and in fact it should be which is good
because you don't really want to you
know you've never in extreme
overclocking you don't want to be
overclocking on the edge of what the vrm
can do because that leads to unexpected
shutdowns unexpectedly dead motherboards
you know those kinds of things so it's
nice to have some Headroom this
definitely has some Headroom but it's
it's insane it is absolutely insane and
you know what it's as far as I'm
concerned it is at least nice to see a
28 phase erm where the 28 phases
actually freaking work like these are
laid out in a way that they will and
have a heatsink big enough that you can
actually utilize like use them to their
full well don't necessarily full
capability but a lot like you can
actually make use of this because
there's a lot of
mother boards out there which would have
you know on paper the specs would be
similar in terms of what components they
use and what kind of what phase count
they have but the way the vrm would be
laid out and the cooling the vrm would
be given would be completely inadequate
for handling these kinds of current
outputs so yeah absolutely crazy
motherboard right here no no the highest
phase count but definitely the most
powerful motherboard I think I've ever
seen it might even be the straight up
actually this is definitely the most
powerful vrm I've ever seen on anything
ever because even like the Supra you
know even 1080 T is 980ti Zin 780 Ti
switch 780 ATT eyes were notorious power
hogs like those guards would easily hit
1500 watts power consumption on liquid
nitrogen
well even those you know that they would
settle for a 14 or 16 phase VRM 980ti is
very similar to the 780 Ti in terms of
power consumption again you wouldn't see
them above 16 with more than 16 phases
and then there's this thing which is
just absolutely insane because Intel
lost their freaking mind and it is
really really cool that they did because
this is from like an extreme overclock
as a hardware enthusiast this is
freaking awesome as as far as practical
uses go this doesn't have any as far as
I'm concerned I can't see any good
reason to get this or even to overclock
it to the point where you would need a
vrm this big because your CP like this
VRM is gonna be you know on a normal
cooling system this vrm is gonna be
serviced like really underused because
the this is this is this is designed
basically to run this on liquid nitrogen
which makes me wonder if Intel was
originally planning to demo these on ln2
or if they plan to do an L n 2 demo
sometime in the future because this
board would certainly be capable of
doing
as impractical as it would be to do so
yeah
crazy crazy vrm right here and with the
the power connectors each of these for a
continuous power for continuous power
draw a single eight pin is good for 480
watts but with extreme overclocking what
you need to keep in mind the time time
matters and also how much air flow you
have you can actually if you point a fan
at your cables your cables can handle
more power because they're getting
cooled similarly if you have you know
air flow over your power connectors
they're getting cooled they're not gonna
they're not gonna burn out on you when
you push them beyond their recommended
specifications and also if the benchmark
only lasts a couple seconds well it
takes time for a connector to overheat
and melt so as long as you don't run
anything that lasts say half an hour
well okay
half an hour might be pushing it but
usually it takes like 10 minutes before
you see you know see your like before
you start seeing thermal issues so and
also well sometimes a lot longer than
that but you know 10 minutes would
probably be the upper limit for how long
you could run a benchmark while say
pushing 600 watts into one of these or
maybe even 700 so the the time the
length of your workload also matters
when it comes to considering the power
connectors for a daily system as
ridiculous as it would be this this is
plenty capable for extreme overclocking
it would you know you'd be riding the
edge on the power connectors which is
actually why the the other board that
was used for demoing the ROG one that
one had six power connectors around the
sieve for the CPU vrm I prefer that
approach that I think is a better that I
think is definitely the better option
for a liquid nitrogen overclocking a one
of these twenty eight cores eons but for
for this right here like the this would
still work especially considering as I
also mentioned it's actually kind of
unlikely that you would see the CPU pull
more than 2,000 watts continuous anyway
or even 2,000 watts continuous but is
it's really hard to say without actually
like having any hard you know data hard
test data to to go off of so that's
that's that now then let's cover some of
the minor vrm is rather quickly so this
right here is VCC well I'm assuming as
VCC si again I there's no information on
this we got shown pictures and some some
crazy Cinebench scores but no actual
details so this I'm assuming is VCC si
based on the fact that this is where VCC
si is located 4 X 299 and this being a
you know is sky like Z on it should be
very very very similar to X 299 CPUs
since those are also technically sky
like Zeon's just branded as I nines now
and on a smaller die but it wouldn't
really like well it could be VCC io
honestly this could be either VC CSA or
VCC IO it wouldn't really matter what
you put one of them if until decided to
rearrange how the pins are laid out in
the socket then you could switch them
around but I'm just gonna go with this
being VCCS a the voltage controller for
this is a 3 5 2 0 4 and that is a 3 + 1
phase voltage controller and it's being
severely underused here because there's
just one if IR 3553 in the single phase
VC CSA which is fine because VCCS a
really even even here wouldn't need to
push that much power it should actually
mean it should push more power than it
would need on say on regular sky like X
because this has more PCIe K uh more
PCIe and more memory channels but it
shouldn't be hugely different and this
like a single-phase IR 35:53 ona on a
skylight deck system is already massive
overkill so here it's just it's still
actually overkill just not quite as much
now that memory power is a ridiculous
three-phase as seems like the trend is
to just put a phase for every you know
every channel here
so you do get a three-phase right here
for V DDR and that's controlled by this
chip right here which is again a 3 v 2 0
4 and it's actually running in 3 plus 0
this time and this time around instead
of 1 plus a 0 and the power stages are
again international rectifier 3553 s
honestly this erm would be more
efficient if it was a single-phase
instead of 3 because even with 3 members
like even with six sticks of ddr4 at
least non-ecc ddr4 I'm not sure if like
the super high density ECC sticks pull
more power but consumer-grade ddr4 which
I assume if Intel is going to make this
because this is overclockable so I'm
assuming they're gonna strip it of ECC
capabilities and limit how much memory
it can address to you know push it away
from their server from server people
from their server come out the customers
so for regular memory sticks this is
massive overkill because like even with
6 slots right here if they were all
occupied and running at like 1.5 volts
you'd still be only looking at like 8
amps output and 8 amps is like just
about approaching the peak of the
efficiency curve for one of these not
for 3 of them so for 3 of them this is
actually really this VM is running
pretty inefficient because there's too
many phases should but well you know
it's fine because the heats spread
across more phases and ultimately your
vrm efficiency down here doesn't matter
when you have this monstrosity on the
motherboard so that's the memory power
this right here I assume is VPP I am not
sure about the details on that
it's a supporting rail for ddr4 then we
get what I assume is VCC IO which is the
same exact story as VCC SA except I
can't locate the voltage controller for
that it might be this that kind of looks
like it could be a thirty five thirty
thirty-five to 0-4 but not 100% certain
there and up here on the other side of
the board you get more VDD R and another
VPP
Faye's right there so basically the rest
of the board is pretty you know pretty
standard well the the three-phase memory
power is unique to this platform as
normally you would see well at most two
phases for memory power but one phase
per channel is also a thing it's just it
kind of depends on how high-end the
motherboard is so now it's a it's a
pretty you know if you ignore the
monstrosity that is the VCC and this is
a pretty normal motherboard you know if
you just ignore the the socket and the
the VCC and vrm now some other
interesting things to note there's RGB
headers on this thing there's also two
postcodes but that that's kind of you
know that's really that's kind of a
given because this is a prototype board
using four you used for like like this
is probably you know an internal
engineering sample which they're
actually using to test the platform so
the fact that it has postcodes is kind
of just a given because that's handy to
have on a prototype board isn't it but
there are RGB headers which is just like
well really odd like that that is that
is concerning because I don't think they
are like the people who designed this
board I don't think they put those there
just for you know having RGB lights on
in the lab that this motherboard spends
most of its time in this this seems like
Intel actually intends to one day ship
this because there's really no reason
for there to be more RGB down here and
this audio section looks like it's been
ripped right off of a regular
maintaining gigabyte board there's also
a BIOS which but I'm gonna say that
that's you know that kind of comes with
this being a development board though it
is socketed the BIOS chip is in a socket
so this is kind of optional for you know
a development board like this but it is
still there but mostly those RGB headers
in that audio section it just have me
wondering like
we might actually some see something
that isn't this because I don't think
this is even a TX it does seem to be
abiding to some motherboard form factor
but it's definitely not ATX and so we
might actually see this thing in like
quotation marks retail you know as
retail as something like this can be
because it is so ridiculous but yet
there yet there's our GB headers so it
seems like they actually intend to go
ahead with one of these for normal users
because this doesn't look like they this
doesn't really look like they took a
server board and smacked a giant vrm on
it this looks more like they they just
built made a monstrous motherboard that
you know is just absolutely freaking
insane so this this is a thing this is
what Intel needs to get a 28 core Xeon
to do five gigahertz without blowing the
vrm to pieces which that Xeon would
actually like if you took that 28 core Z
on and just overclocked it on water or
at least ran it at the settings that
Intel was demoing it at it would
probably blow up most x2 99 motherboards
there there's a few motherboards which
would just about survive it but most of
them would get obliterated which is why
things like why this exists and why the
ROG
dominus board exists because well
regular X 299 and server boards
especially not server boards wouldn't
handle this because server boards work
with CPUs that have a TDP limited to 300
watts and so they can get away with an
eight phase-- or a six phase even but
this this this doesn't have limits this
is the very definition of removing all
limits here but this is just ridiculous
and it really makes me happy as an
enthusiast to see it even if I think
it's also completely impractical and
ridiculous it's the this this is like
this is like the the liquid
what liquid nitrogen is to CPU cooling
this is to CPUs and motherboards like
that's what this is because this is
completely insane and awesome so yeah
that's it for the video thank you for
