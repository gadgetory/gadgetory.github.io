of our first few videos of the show what
we have here is the concept slates only
talking about two products of the course
overview today the first one is this
massive case which is somewhat
reminiscent of the Obsidian line like
the city of 900 d√©fis remember that
later in the video we'll be talking
about something new closely coolers the
next-gen hydro series for concepts plate
the main thing to point out other than
obviously its sheer size is this
particular build is a two system bill so
there's an ATX form factor motherboard
up here and an ITX form factor
motherboard mounted atop the power
supply shroud which is removable by the
way and that is what host IC x system so
then you've got the video card on here
1080i 1080i and both of these if you've
noticed our liquid cooled but their
liquid cooled of course our brand apart
so that's the other big push forces
making here they are trying to get into
the open loop space and that's something
we're seen as a bit of a trend right now
specifically this year EK WB is pushing
harder in that space as well so open
loop is going to heat up for this year
definitely but getting back to the case
power supply shroud this is a giant hard
drive cage array so we'll show a
backside shot of that you can put a ton
of drive cages in there and on that
backside shot you can actually see that
there are French doors and for accessing
the storage so all of the SSDs I think
from memory is like three on one x three
on the other SSDs plus the hard drive
pages in the center so those open up to
access that and other interesting pieces
I suppose would be there's actually like
a rail server rack mounting feature up
here so the sort of rail system is what
hosts the radiator which is right there
and then there's also one of the front
over here you pull the rails out mount
the rad and there's support for two rads
mounting on the front and then we've got
one up here in this current build this
case you kind of give give some
perspective now that we've gone over all
of the craziness this is not necessarily
going to ship as is this is a concept
case hence the name concepts plates so
of course share is showing this off as
what for two main reasons one this may
be a new halo product like the obsidian
9 hardy which clearly not everyone buys
nor should everyone by
but it's something that fits a very
specific audience - it's a way to show
off new ideas and so those ideas on this
specific build would be things like the
rails the rails from stores in the bag
stuff like that and then theoretically
bring it down to other product lines in
the future so with that perspective in
mind no price right now release date may
be quarter three or four but again
things will probably change by then so
that's most of the case to go over a
couple of really quick specs off the
sheet the case itself weighs about 40
pounds I believe they have three liters
of coolant in here which is by itself
pretty heavy and the system itself is
some are the 100 to 120 pound range just
the entire build next week so that gives
you an idea of how big it really is this
door alone I've been told is somewhere
in the range of five pounds as well and
that is because it's using a four
millimeter thick piece of tempered glass
on the side there's four mil thick glass
on the front all the aluminum bits are
four millimeters thick as well and then
the structural steel part is one mil
thick which is also pretty pretty large
and expensive for a case you don't
really see that in cases normally when
you see a measurement close to one mil
it includes the paint measurement as
well this is just the steel properties
one mil thing so I think that runs us
through the case we're gonna move over
to the cooling now so the new hydro
series coolers check that out including
the 8 X 6 gen modified pump all right so
now that we are done with the large case
we're looking at the hydro series cooler
so this is the next gen of hydro series
coolers they don't have a name just yet
but they're interesting for one primary
reason at least right now and that is
that they're using a modified six
generates a clump this is the first time
we've at least at our outlets seeing the
6 gen pumps in actual it's all been
fists 4.5 for the EVGA coolers a GPU one
and four done before that so that's kind
of new this is a little bit modified
with coursers next gen hydro series the
key items of note would be first of all
the pump housing the block is a little
bit smaller than the previous series we
have some footage of the h1 15i for
example a much bigger block and also
they have reverted back to the tubes
protruding from the side using an L
bracket 90 degree I'll break it rather
than from the top of the pump
speaking personally I prefer
that because we often you do the hydrent
hybrid mods for our video cards so when
you do that you really don't want them
sticking out of the top of the housing
because it just messes everything up
there's no clearance for anything so
that helps there and on that note the
smaller form factor of the blocks of the
pump housing will theoretically allow
for better support with hybrid mods in
the future we happen to do one so that's
data the next thing would be to talk
about what's going on underneath we
don't know any details about the sixth
gen pump yet at least one that can be
shared today the cold plate on the
bottom side though theoretically has
been a little bit modified for Corsair
we don't know the full details yet we'll
tear one down eventually and show you
but modified cold plate by a stack for
course there there's a modified PCB
inside so it presumably it's not just
the normal a stack straight PCB that
they ship with basically everything
except for the kraken x XX 2 series
that's what we're looking at there the
PCB modifications don't know the
expensive yet however one interesting
thing on on the front of controls and
firmware and all of that would be the
PWM setup for the new cooler so
previously one of the biggest complaints
we've had especially the 5th gen stuff
is that the liquid temperature is really
what dictates and governs the speed of
the pump and that's kind of useless
because even if you put a 7700 k and
they're 5 gigahertz which we've done
you'll get stuck at something like 30 C
for the liquid temperature and the CPU
will just keep climbing climbing doesn't
matter so now that a specs moving to
something more similar to what cool it
does and allowing better control of or
more parameters for control of the
Pampas feeds of fan speed things like
that theoretically we'll see some better
performance out of these things
particularly in the noise arena so
that's another big point that coursers
been pushing with the Dyson hydro series
is to drive down noise we don't know a
whole lot of details just yet they are
including maglev fans which will help in
that department the pump noise has
always been a big complaint by a lot of
you on the AC net coolers but you can
only go down to formula 90% PWM and you
just find a noise so this should
continue helping in that area so I think
that's most of it a couple small things
to note I guess on the radiator it is a
larger radiator core something like 2
millimeter larger we don't know the
poldi's have nothing
we finalized just yet as a larger
radiator this is a 360 there's a 280
next to me as well and that's all we
have for today so as always the links in
the description below for full
information with the article and the
rest of the stuff that was that was
sweet
we'll have some separate news items on
