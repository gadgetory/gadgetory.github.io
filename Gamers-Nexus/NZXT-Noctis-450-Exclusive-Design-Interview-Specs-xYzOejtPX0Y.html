we're talking about NZXT C's new Noctis
450 mid tower case this case uses the
same chassis the frame as the H 440 but
has a vastly different exterior and even
some performance tweaks I had the
opportunity to speak with chun-tae who
worked as a designer on the Knox's 450
and that's what you're about to listen
to here is our conversation talking
about the design aspects what went into
the case what users should expect and
things like that click the link in the
description below for the full article
on this case and as always we will have
a review online as soon as we've got
samples in hand which should be very
soon so subscribe for that here's the
interview so on the on the Noctis 450
can you sort of give me your starting
point as a designer when you set out to
work on the noctis you know what were
your major sources of inspiration and
things like that well I think not this I
think we start with something sort of
like a Fenton Fenton ish kind of
direction really like aggressive design
something that like I was a heavily
inspired by my concepts your artworks
comes at cards and stuff like that
you just want to be something really out
there
the noctus one of the most immediate
things that I noticed looking through
some of the the press images was the LED
under glow yeah yeah so what can you
tell me more about that is that is that
an LED or is it a cathode tube or what's
going on there it's a lead it's very
much like the razor on that we had
before so basically similar similar idea
with different colors and it just
happened that I think the case is well
filled with LED black under glowing see
the price point I think is set at a
hundred and forty dollars right now yeah
okay so at that price point are there
any other cases currently on the market
that you feel like the nock does 450 is
a response to this is like a premium
kind of mid tower case I think style
wise very much
comparison out there right now I'm in
the chassis I mean it's it's been there
I mean people have liked how the edge
felonious and and so I think the thing
is structure wise it's all good it's
it's very solid yeah
have there been any changes to the
chassis itself or is it basically
identical to the 440 pretty much I
didn't call okay
and looking at the images here there's
something that's a little bit hard to
understand just from the graphics I have
but it looks like there's sort of an
overarching piece of plastic on top of
the case and on the front like they sort
of cross each other yeah so I think
that's that's a really a big big main
idea of the noctus is that we trying to
have some this kind of layering design
thing that's you know like most of the
cases out there it's pretty much like a
solid block wrapping around the chassis
we're trying to have different layers
going like underneath than the other
ones so it really created the test of
the overall design and it actually also
helps the strength of the the panel is
to it because that's one issue that
we're facing that while we're having
this kind of floating ideas we were
facing to the structural issues so
that's that's how we kind of end up with
this interlocking
layering design right and so was that a
was that a design challenge where you
were having structural issues and this
sort of helps resolve that yeah yeah
were there any other design or
manufacturing challenges that you came
up with clever solutions to for the
Noctis 450 well also like ironies the
match we also add some some neck
structures underneath that's it not only
like surf you know it's a structure but
also like the layering design that we're
talking about also and almost like a
fourth layer underneath the mesh the
closer that you get to the product we
actually see more things and then you
kind of continuously discovering the the
product I think in terms of
functionality and per
formants I see three front fans and one
rear fan can you are there's 140 or 120
I believe you're old 120 things okay
given the design and the faceplate of
the 450 does the 450 lend itself to
better air intake than the the previous
like the H 440 and things like that oh
yeah we do internal tests comparisons
with of course - 440 we did you some the
some of the product within that a
similar price range and yeah I think not
this is outperforming the of them
basically it got all the message there
so it got really good air flows what's
sort of the target user who is your best
fit user I think the the not ins this is
for someone really looking for some sort
of exciting case like looking you know
they're looking for something that
really appreciate or really looking
forward to have some exciting design I
mean that for woody is awesome the
source before is really great as well
but the doctor is going in a different
direction it's more aggressive it's more
like buying a super car that you are
being attracted by those appeals but
then also that you have a really good
chassis that they support pretty much
everything that you need the look is the
main thing also the lighting under
glowing lighting really gonna help
people get attention on this product
basically
