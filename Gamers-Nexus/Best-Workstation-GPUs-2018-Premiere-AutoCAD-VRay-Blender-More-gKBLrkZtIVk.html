as straightforward as finding the best
gaming GPU while games typically scale
reliably from one to the next
applications can deliver wildly varying
performance those gains and losses can
be chalked up to architecture drivers
and also whether or not we're dealing
with a true workstation GPU or a gaming
GPU trying to fill in for workstation
purposes in this video we're going to be
taking a look at current workstation GPU
performance across a range of tests and
figure out if there's such thing as a
champion among them all or in the very
least we'll figure out how AMD differs
from Nvidia and how the gaming cards
different from the workstation
counterparts before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte zi 390
ARS master motherboard which comes
equipped with one of the more powerful Z
390 VRMs for heavier overclocks on the
new 9th gen intel cpus the ARS master is
also one of the few motherboards with a
real heatsink this generation featuring
a mix of high surface area fins and
looks oriented cover blocks oh and it's
also got updated RDV illumination learn
more at the link below
although nvidia quadro r-tx lineup has
been available for a few months
review samples have been slow to escape
the grasp Nvidia and if we had to guess
why it's likely due to the fact that few
software solutions are available that
can take advantage of the features right
now that would exclude deep learning
test which can benefit from the tensor
cores but four optimizations derived
from the RT core we're still waiting it
seems likely that Kaos groups v-ray is
going to be one of the first plugins to
hit the market that will support
Nvidia's RT X the redshift octane Arnold
Renderman and many others have planned
support the great thing for those
planning to go with a gaming GPU for
workstation use is that we're rendering
is concerned the performance between
gaming and workstation is going to be
largely the same where performance can
improve and workstation cares' with the
viewport performance optimizations
ultimately the smoother the viewport the
less tedious it is to manipulate a scene
across all of the results ahead you'll
see that there are many angles to view
workstation GPUs from and that there
isn't really such thing as one size fits
all not like there is on the gaming side
there is such thing as an ultimate
choice though so if you're not afraid of
spending substantially above the gaming
equivalents for the best workstation
performance there are models vying for
your attention to kick things off we'll
take a look at viewport performance also
known as one of the most important
performance metrics of probe is graphics
cards it's also some of the most
interesting performance as we'll see in
a moment because not all applications
are built the same and likewise not all
optimizations are built the same
Nvidia's top-end geforce r-tx 28 ET i
wasted little time to start its stuff it
pulls comfortably ahead of last gens top
dog Titan XP and notably ahead of every
Pascal Quadra we have access to insta
Quadro r-tx 6,000 and 8,000 have an
additional 256 cores those models would
undoubtedly top the chart here on the
AMD side of the fence both the rx bag is
64 and Radeon Pro WX 8200 perform close
to the same which is interesting as the
WX 8200 is specs similarly to the Vega
56 not 264 despite AMD strong
performance with those GPUs in video
becomes a clear winner here especially
with this top-end g4 SRT x20 atti
the Pascal based na DTI also delivers
super strong performance even beating
out the last gen quadrille p6000 big
gains could be seen with the GeForce
r-tx and the 3ds max results but Maya
lets the turning architecture take
things to the next level
it simply dominates the top of this
chart far exceeding the performance of
the Titan XP yet again the current top
entering quadrant would rule this chart
if we had them to test but let's just
relish the fact that GeForce r-tx has
not held back here in any way as for AMD
its Radeon Pro WX 8200 managed to swap
positions with the technically faster rx
Vegas 64 and by a fair margin at 1080p
meanwhile the quadrille P 5000 fails to
impress against GT X 1080 TI which gains
handsomely at both resolutions and
delivers excellent performance for its
price it could be worth pointing out
that while the Vega base WX 8200
outperformed the gaming focus Vega 64
the player space WX 7100 failed to
topple the RX 580 the same way it seems
Vega has some specific boosts in Maya
but Quadro and GeForce on the whole
deliver similar performance between them
the most interesting viewport
performance results always seem to be
tied up with top-end CAD design sweets
like CATIA while the RT x 28 DTI reigned
at the top in the 3ds Max and Maya tests
it falls to the middle of the pack here
bested by both the Radeon Pro WX 8200
and even the rx Vega 64 Radeon Pro
doesn't seem to inherit much of an
optimization here although the WX 8200
did manage to best the Vega 64 at 1080p
just not at 4k quadrille P 4000 is much
more affordable than the RT X xx atti at
about half its price yet it delivers for
improved performance overall results
like these are why it truly pays to know
your workload we're literally dealing
with the situation here where invidious
gaming GPUs have crippled performance
but AMD's don't the only reason the
Titan X
is at the top of the chart is because
NVIDIA has carried over specific
optimizations to his Titan series and
CATIA is clearly one of those CATIA had
flip-flopped strings between AMD and
NVIDIA and their workstation versus
gaming gravis cards but things get
shaken up quite a bit with SolidWorks
here the last gen Quadro reigned supreme
with the gaming cards on both sides of
the fence taking a huge hit
optimizations are clearly in place for
AMD's and invidious workstation graphics
cards and in this case that even
includes the Titan XP while that Titan
XP enjoyed a performance boost with
katia over geforce cards they equally
suspect quadrille p6000 simply
obliterates its performance AMD also
delivers super strong performance here
too with its Radeon Pro WX 8200 from the
best bang for the buck standpoint that
card is the most compelling of the bunch
and most of the results seen up to this
point GPUs have scaled largely as
expected but the gaming GPUs once in a
while sitting lower on the list Siemens
and X gives us our first look at some
gaming GPUs getting absolutely murdered
with all four of the AMD and NVIDIA
gaming cards locked to the bottom
interestingly AMD's gaming cards perform
a lot better than nvidias here but at
this performance level it unfortunately
doesn't matter similar to what we saw in
SolidWorks the last gen quadrille p6000
delivers explosive performance in s and
X though the Titan XP doesn't lag too
far behind and it's definitely the most
value packed of the two the Radeon Pro
WX 8200 again shows strong performance
speeding out invidious last gen P 4000
but falling behind the quadrille P 5000
which is clearly enjoying some
unparalleled levels of optimization
considering it in the W X 8200 are not
far apart from the theoretical
performance standpoint while the P 4000
delivers great performance for its price
the newer W X 8200 from AMD looks to
offer some of the best bang for the buck
here that's nice to see since the
company has been putting in huge effort
to bolster its performance in these
super important design Suites as with
SolidWorks creo is clearly optimize on
Quadra more than it is on Radeon Pro
since the Quadra P 5000 was able to pull
so far ahead of the W X 8200 despite the
quadrille P 4000 being a fair bit weaker
it performs close to the same as the W X
8200 and meanwhile the top dog Vega our
x64 gaming GPU doesn't show its greatest
strengths in this test but speaking of
strengths and videos GeForce cars have
made a return to the top of the chart
here with the RT X 20 DTI once again
gloating from above it's worth noting
that it only just beats out the Titan XP
which was actually priced the same
what the founders edition r-tx 20 DTI is
now at $1,200 ultimately nvidia proves
to be the best choice with creo at least
if you're fine sticking with a gaming
GPU the GTX 1080 Ti delivers great
performance for its price even managing
to beat out the more expensive quadrille
P 5000 at 4k if you thought seeing as a
nexus results were interesting get a
load of this auto cad set in this suite
there is such a strong divided between
Nvidia and AMD that the chart is
literally split in half between them
interestingly the r-tx 28 DTI failed to
clinch the top spot but it seems likely
that the quadrille r-tx 6000 would do so
without issue thanks to its higher core
count still there's a point when the
performance only improved so much so
again the GT X 1080 Ti looks like the
most value packed card when even the low
B quadrille P mm beats at the W X 8200
it's obvious that AMD is lacking
optimization in this application or at
least enough of it to make a difference
at the company's recent next horizon
event autocad was named dropped as an
application that gets continual
performance enhancements so we hope that
the performance outlook changes before
long it'd be nice to see a better blend
among these results viewport performance
is important but so is rendering in fact
rendering performance is where you can
really feel the hurt if you're using
lower end hardware renders that take 10
minutes on top and GPUs could instead
take 3 hours and lower end ones you
always need to weigh various factors
before finally deciding anew next GPU
for workstation purchase we're going to
start out with blender for a couple of
reasons first there is no Nvidia r-tx
result here because current builds of
the popular open source design suite
don't support it we're not just talking
about lack of r-tx features support a
lack of touring support on the whole the
only builds that will run on RTS right
now are internal to Nvidia and blender
so if you noticed 28 DTI results on
planets benchmarking website you can
feel rest assured that they didn't come
from the community that aside AMD's
Radeon rx Vega 64 simply kills it in
this test beating out every single other
GPU including last gens top-end Titan XP
again RTS would very likely beat out the
Vegas 64 but from a price standpoint the
Vegas 64 delivers truly impressive
performance it beats out the 1080 Ti by
a lot not just a little because no
Quadro RT X card can be found in this
chart the most impressive cards here are
actually the gaming counterparts not the
official workstation equivalents AMD's
open source radio and pro render is an
excellent option for anyone to test out
whether you're a seasoned pro or a
newbie trying to get into the ecosystem
as cheaply as
possible with pro render you could take
a completely free tool like blender and
the completely free Pro render plug-in
and begin the learning journey to create
some impressive raytrace scenes Pro
render even recently gained
heterogeneous CPU and GPU rendering
support though it currently only works
on AMD zone Radeon Pro cards from a
stretched GPU rendering standpoint in
videos relentless GeForce r-tx card
strikes again I'm guessing that the lack
of heterogeneous support and NVIDIA GPU
ties in with the reason that the dual
Titan XP configuration failed the leap
past this single RT X xx atti
that result alone as flawed as it might
be is still downright impressive nothing
else comes close to the RT X xx DTI
aside from those dual Titan X P's really
there's not too much else to say here
except for the fact that GeForce beats
Radeon in Radeon pro render how weird is
that to say ultimately the more GPU
horsepower you have Radeon Pro render
will take great advantage of it
unfortunately for AMD there exist a
bunch of renderers on the market that
are tuned exclusively for a Nvidia CUDA
API completely ruling out AMD's chance
at having some fun it could be that in
time those renderers will cave to
growing a Radeon Pro market share and
broaden support to open CL but it's
going to be a real uphill battle for AMD
because AMD's cards are locked out of
this in the next two tests GeForce r-tx
2080 in 2070 I've been tossed in for
good measure
redshift is going to gain proper support
for NVIDIA is RT core in a future
release but even right now RTI's cards
deliver very impressive performance with
the RT x 2080 surpassing titan XP and
the 2080 ti yet again sitting
comfortably on top what's interesting
here is that the Quadra p6000 fails to
beat out the 1080 Ti despite having more
cores to help it out memory bandwidth on
P 6000 is actually less than it is on
the GTX 1080 TI which might play a bit
of a role here with v-ray it's important
to note that the renderer does support
AMD's GPUs with OpenCL but in our
testing we've never managed to get a
render out of it to look good on Radeon
it could be that projects are needed to
be built from the ground up and not
simply poured it over but even the
standalone v-ray benchmark has sporadic
performance with AMD's GPUs so Nvidia is
really the only choice for v-ray right
now as with any render worth its weight
in bytes
v-ray can take full advantage of
multiple GPUs and will deliver massive
performance gains as a result unlike SLI
or crossfire you don't actually need
identical GPUs to take advantage of all
to GPU with renderers so if you're
thinking of upgrading you don't actual
have to get rid of your old card unless
your system simply couldn't support two
GPUs in videos r-tx again shines here
even though the special Artie core
features have yet to roll out the RT X
2080 beats at the Titan XP despite being
slower in most other tests so it seems
likely that NVIDIA has some specific
Turing optimizations that do a great job
of eking additional performance out of
this renderer Oh toys octane is yet
another renderer that's going to be
gained proper r-tx support at some point
soon but even without it in videos RT x
cards become the obvious best choice for
those looking for top-end performance
CRT X xx atti beats out the Titan XP
while the RT X 2080 follows not too far
behind that the 1080 TI looks to be one
of the better value propositions in this
chart beating out the new RT x 2070
though technically still costing a bit
more meanwhile it's fun to see how a
card like the RT x 2070 performs against
not just the quadrille p6000 but also
the maxwell based m 6000 which is
equivalent in specs to the original
titan x as many of these tests have
proven going with the lower end GPU is
not going to deliver an ideal rendering
performance kind of like how a shavette
isn't going to satisfy like a Corvette
to round our test out we're going to
finish up with encoding tests involving
two popular video editors Adobe's
Premiere Pro CC and matresses Vegas Pro
looking at these premiere results which
involves a real 1080p project in code
and also a 4k to 1080p reading code
there's really not much of a variation
at the top of the charts it seems clear
that there was a point when you can have
too much GPU horsepower for video
editing there's barely a difference
between the top card and the one ranked
5 below it what does become clear is
that while you can have too much GPU for
encoding you can also have too little as
evidenced by the bottom AMD Polaris
results for straightforward video
encoding AMD performs fine but when a
full-fledged project is being encoded it
seems like there's more to the picture
than immediately meets the eye
giving Nvidia the ultimate nod overall
for the final test we're looking at the
popular Vegas editor for MAGIX which
enjoyed the release of version 16 a few
months ago both of the results seen here
represents simpler single falling codes
but each have some common filters piled
on top to get the GPU to actually show
off what it can do these results seem to
be all over the place but there's some
explanation as to what's going on for
the most part the ABC encode scales as
expected but we do see some interesting
results such as the Titan XP performing
pretty much identically to the GTX 1080
Ti the Vegas 64 also performs extremely
well sliding in behind only a single GPU
the r-tx 28 DTI
meanwhile with the h-e-b C codec nvidia
strengths become apparent with even the
small quadrille p2000 outperforming
every single one of the radeon gpus this
is an extreme example of where it pays
to know your workload because while the
Radeon Pro is fine for AVC it falls far
behind with a GBC that situation is
surely going to improve over time but as
with many future performance outlooks we
have no idea when it actually will
there's quite a bit of data to pour over
and as expected it's difficult to find a
workstation graphics card that rules
them all because quite honestly there
isn't one there were cases across our
performance look we're either AMD or
Nvidia took the lead but it's safe to
say that Nvidia gets the performance not
overall with its RT X cards dominating
most of the tests they touch
unfortunately there were no Titan V or
quad row RT X results to share but their
performance wouldn't be too hard to
guess wherever the Titan X P performs
extremely well Titan V is likely to
perform even better and to that end one
of the most important things to bear in
mind when choosing a GPU for workstation
purposes is whether or not the limited
frame buffer of the gaming card will
introduce roadblocks you'd have to be
building complex scenes to exceed the 12
gigabyte frame buffer of the Titan XP
but the need for more GPU memory is only
going to increase over time there are
other things to take into consideration
as well such as the error correction
memory although use of that in the probe
is market is actually quite rare what's
not rare is required certification which
is important for enterprise environments
that demand the most stable platform
possible and not to mention the best
support that in things like proper
10-bit color support and applications
make options like the workstation car is
better than the gaming cards but for
some losing those features to gain in
performance at a given price is a fair
trade-off and that wraps it up for this
