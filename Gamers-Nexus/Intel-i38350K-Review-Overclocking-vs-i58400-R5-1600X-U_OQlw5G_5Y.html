component review this time analyzing the
unlocked I 380 350 K CPU when the I 370
350 K came out we noted that it made
absolutely no sense at its launch price
but that we really encouraged the
direction of overclockable i3 CPUs and
hoped Intel would continue that just
with more sensible pricing it was a mix
of good idea bad price and price
ultimately dictates viability in the
market today we're back to see if the 83
50 K suggested retail price of 168 to
$179 makes any sense
and if the CPU can even be had at those
prices before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
on video with the destiny to 1080 TI
bundle a 1080i SC to comes with a
synchronous fan control for its dual
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below with the
shake up from coffee like just going
through the data before this video was
almost a little confusing at times I'd
be looking at an i-5 8400 versus in 83
50 K and kind of wondering why the
performance was the way it was and the
thing is you have to remember that Intel
now has moved to six cores six threads
for the i-5 8400 and upward and that
impacts things significantly obviously
games and software that uses the extra
two cores will seriously benefit from it
and that means that the stepping between
an i3 and an i-5 and some applications
is now greater than previously what's
also different of course is that with an
unlocked I three CPU like these 7350 K
we have some Headroom to gain that back
the question as it was with KB Lake is
whether or not it actually makes sense
to buy one and overclock it to try and
claw your way up to an i-5 that's locked
or if you should just buy the locks i-5
to begin with and call it a day there
and at this price it's pretty damn close
to lock the i-5 territory anyway so the
i-5 8400 depending on where you check
and when you check if you can find it
seems to be in the range of 180 it's
maybe $200 sometimes it goes higher if
it's sold by third parties but that
seems to be about the range for
retailers the 8350 K is supposed to be a
little bit cheaper than the 8th
400 high 5 CPU which is 6 core 6 thread
as opposed to the age of the KS 4 core 4
thread setup but it doesn't seem to be
available for that price right now so
when they appear they're roughly the
same price plus or minus 10 dollars that
makes them direct competitors so the r5
1600 for example makes more sense to
compare to the 83 to the K because
ultimately they fall out about the same
price ignoring the cost of things like
the motherboard and just looking at
strictly the CPUs so for the purpose of
this video we're primarily going to
focus the verbal energy on talking about
the r5 versus the a 350 K there are some
r3 benchmarks in here keep in mind that
this is new test methodology for us that
we introduced with coffee-like so not
everything has been retested yet
including some of the r3 SKUs however
the r3 SKUs are significantly cheaper
target a slightly different market and
therefore don't necessarily need to be
here
as much as the RF eyes which are here
quickly for overclocking as always we
have all the components used in the
article linked in the description below
so click the article for the full
testing methods and things like that but
for overclocking we use the ultra gaming
z3 78 gigabyte board it is not my
favorite board to overclock with but it
gets the job done and we were able to do
4.8 gigahertz at one point three seven
five for the vcore with an AV X offset
of two so we're going negative 2 on the
multiplier for a V X applications like
blender which means it will run at four
point six rather than four point eight
whereas everything else runs at four
point eight that helps stabilize things
we did push voltage as high as one point
four two and we're not able to stabilize
beyond four point eight gigahertz for
non AVX applications so sadly no four
point nine no 5.0 it might be achievable
with a different motherboard but we
didn't get it with this one for the CPU
so a bit limited there some of this also
may come down to load line calibration
and things like that but we're still
playing around with it civilization six
will start us off on the gaming
benchmarks side this one is a frequency
intensive benchmark and has proven that
term time is less dependent on cores
note also that the sieve a I benchmark
should not be used
to test FPS because at worse CPUs will
score higher frame rates as a result of
spending more time on static screens a G
4560 for instance would outperform in r7
1700 or i7 7700 K that's not because
it's better it's because of how the
benchmark is built so much surprisingly
the i386 DK performs about where the r5
1600 X at 4.1 gigahertz performs this
shows the frequency importance for the
title the 82 DK completes each turn in
18 seconds totally 90 seconds for all
five turns the r5 1600 X finishes in
seventeen point nine seconds at 4.1
gigahertz or nineteen point two seconds
stock the Intel i5 8400 meanwhile
completes turns in roughly seventeen
point five seconds depending on the
memory frequency for the CPU overclock
in the 83 TK to 4.8 gigahertz reduces
the time requirement by nine point six
percent tying the CPU with a stock 8700
K GTA 5 at 1080p with custom settings
plots our I 380 350 K at 123 FPS average
marking it about on par with the i5 7600
K stock CPU and i5 8400 a stock CPU the
i3 8350 K runs about 13% faster than our
fastest rising CPU on this bench
the overclocked 1700 and about 4.5
percent faster than the i5 8400 with 26
66 megahertz memory scaling upward the
stock 7700 K leads the ATT vdk stock by
6.7% with the overclocked 8350 k
outperforming these stocks 77 100k by
about 3.6 percent this leapfrogs
upward with the overclocks 7700 k cpu
eventually winning out and the 8700 k
predictably leading the charts from top
to bottom the 8700 case stock CPU leads
the 83 50k stock CPU by 18.1% as for the
r3 cpus the r3 1300 x at $130 operates
at 86 FPS average putting it predictably
behind the r5 1500 X 1600 X and r7 1700
at 1440p the gap closes as we encounter
GPU limitations the overclocked to 8700
K and I
counters a GPU bottleneck falling to 131
FPS average and establishing our new
ceiling the 83 50k still lines up in the
same spot in the stack keeping its
positioning right around the stock 7600
K or OC performance at between the 7700
K and 5 gigahertz 7700 K total war
Warhammer at 1080 P Highlands the stock
80 250 K at 145 FPS average right
between these stocks 7600 K and
overclocked are 5 1600 X at 4.1
gigahertz the 8400 performs about 3.3
percent ahead of the stock 8350 K when
the 8400 runs slower memory or 7.3
percent ahead when it uses the same
memory speed overclocking the 83 50k to
4.8 gigahertz puts it about on par with
the 8400 using 3200 my cards of memory
and behind the stock 7700 K with its
eight threads the top to bottom
difference between the 8700 K and 8350 K
is about 22% leadership for the i7 at
1440p the 8350 case stock CPU operates
at 128 FPS average planting it ahead of
the overclocked r7 1700 and about tied
with the r5 1600 X frame time
performance at the low end is also
roughly equal and we are again tied with
these 7600 K 8400 carries a strong lead
with both memory configurations over the
i3 but loses that lead once we overclock
the 83 50k to 4.8 gigahertz watchdogs 2
tends to actually like threads unlike
most games on the market this game
positions the overclocked to i3 at 84
FPS average with lows at 68 FPS 1% and
56 FPS your own percent lows the stock
1600 X is roughly tied with the
overclocked 83 50k carrying a lead of
2.7 percent when both are overclocked as
for the stock 8350 K that's left behind
with the 7600 K stock CPU demonstrating
the core and thread advantage in
watchdogs to 1440p keeps mostly the same
scaling within test variants into error
and shows that the 80 250 K remains
about tied with the previous 7600 K
outputting roughly the same results as
previously within error
ashes of the singularity is our final
game and also one that is through
Limited ashna's plots the 8350 k at the
very bottom of the list
roughly tied with these 7600 k this
makes for an unimpressive display by the
i3 the r5 1600 x stock cpu is 22% ahead
of the stock 8350 k cpu a difference
which squarely lands on the thread
advantage the i3 8350 k just doesn't
keep up very well in this test
moving on to power as a reminder our
power testing is done at the EPS 12-volt
cables rather than the wall so these
numbers are more or less the Seaview
power consumption numbers as measured -
entering into the board the stock I 383
50 K consumes about 47 watts when
rendering our blender scene putting it
within error margins of the overclocked
r3 1200 CPU at 3.9 gigahertz and a
couple watts away from the 1300 X stock
CPU this also plans to 80 - 50 K right
around where the previous 73 50 K was at
5 gigahertz but know the difference and
motherboards means we're not taking vrm
losses into account overclocking the 83
50k to 4.8 gigahertz so we using an a B
X offset of 2 for blender we land at 84
watts with our 1.37 5 volt core and that
puts us near the stock 1600 X not too
distant from the 96 watt of the stock
8700 k 3d marks fire strike measures the
80 350 K at 34 watts or a 27% higher
power consumption than where we measured
the r3 1200 with the r3 1300 X at 11%
higher than the stock 83 50 K
overclocking the coffee like I three to
four point eight gigahertz at one point
three seven five volts puts us up to
1600 X stock levels of power consumption
and not far from the 8700 k stock CPU
using total war Warhammer as a game and
workload for which we haven't yet added
the R 3 CPUs I 380 250 K consumes about
34 watt stock or a 70 1.31 overclocked
respectively that puts us either below
everything or between the AMD r5 1600 X
stock and i7 7700 K at one point three
9v core depending on if you're looking
at the i3 overclocked or not prime95
29.2 with 8k FFTs provides taxing AVX
workloads creating a range of 38 watch
to 590 Watts depending on the voltage of
the CPU and which CPU
by 383 TK predictably falls closer to
the low-end at 65 watt stock which lands
it as nearby the overclock are three
CPUs and below the i-5 8400 or stock are
five CPUs overclocking demands 111 watts
keeping the stack the same as we saw
earlier our blender renders now use
three different scenes two of which were
created in-house and one of which was
modified for use starting with the two
main ones our monkey had seen on blender
2.79
the $170 to $200 i3 coffee-like cpu
completes this scene dead last at 58
minutes to render the frame the r5 1500
X stock CPU priced at $170 finishes with
a 13% time reduction over the coffee
lake chip though overclocking the i3 to
4.6 gigahertz it mostly caches it up
that said we've never really recommended
the 1500 X anyway and rather point you
toward the 1600 over 1,600 X for a
budget rendering CPU the extra threads
matter the 1600 x stock CPU completes
the task in 33 minutes a 43% time
requirement reduction the price isn't
too dissimilar from a 16 hundred and
eighty-three 50k and overclocking at
1600 matches it to a 1600 X anyway
clearly if budget rendering is important
to you the r5 s when easily just decide
whether rendering performance is more
important than gaming and then maybe
consider the I 5s as well look at the
price and make a decision from there as
for the other scenes the GN logo render
puts the 83 50k at 71 minutes stock or
62 minutes when overclocked the r5 1600
X completes this test in about 35 to 38
minutes so no contest there times pi is
next we have the i3 82 50k stock CPU
scoring 40 to 41 points on the CPU test
translating to 14 point to 5 fps for the
physics benchmark this outperforms the
73 50k notably and performs below the
1500 X by 6.5% overclocking the 83 v DK
gets it to a deficit of nine point nine
percent against the locked
8400 which has an additional two cores
that significantly helped this chart
alone makes it a hard sell for the 83 50
K as the i-5 8400 functionally cost the
same and cost is lower if you're looking
at
in the future anyway when the non Z
boards theoretically actually exist some
games make it kind of hard to defend the
a350 K over even Intel's
own AI 580 400 Japan when you look at
the prices they're roughly the same
close enough to choose one of the over
the other depending on the performance
and the 8,400 and games that care about
the extra threads and applications like
time spy like blender it matters there's
actually two threads matter a whole lot
more than the unlocks factor of the i3
which depend on how good your chip is
and how much you're willing to push the
vrm temperatures and things like that
it's not a guarantee how high that clock
goes so it is a bit of a gamble it's fun
to overclock of course we strongly
encourage that these companies like AMD
with the all of the rise and chips and
intel with their now case qi 3s we
encourage that they continue permitting
overclocking on the low end it throws a
wrench in the segmentation a bit but it
makes for a better product overall it
doesn't however count for the fact that
if the product sells at a much higher
price because it's unlocked it now eats
into the territory of its own brethren
the i5 in this case the 8400 9kz bu so
depending on the game depending on the
application the 8,400 can be a better
buy particularly when the extra two
threads that really matter what it comes
down to is are you only gaming with your
system by which i mean your other tasks
consist primarily of things like web
browsing microsoft office products maybe
photoshop things like that in a non
extreme photoshop user fashion then
maybe it's worth looking at one of the
non production focused CPUs if you are
doing any meaningful amount of rendering
whether that's with blender premiere or
otherwise it is worth considering either
an r5 the 1600 1600 X we've strongly
recommended since they came out those
where they lose in gaming they make up
for in production so if your scale of
usage teeters more toward production
it's probably worth buying the r5 CPU if
you can't afford something higher rent
if you're scaled
eaters more towards gaming it's still
worth absolutely looking at the Intel
CPUs but look through the games that you
play the most and kind of mentally put
together when the i5 makes more sense
than the i3 and a lot of instances
they're either close enough that it's
irrelevant or the i5 8400 just kind of
works better with the games that
actually care about the threads like
watchdogs - and the overclocking depend
on how serious you are about it may or
may not be worthwhile for you it's nice
that it's present and it's certainly fun
to use but you do lose enough off the
CPU that it starts falling behind in
some applications even with the OC so
that's all for this one as always you
can check the article link below for
everything there might be a couple of
extra charts there that we don't have
here a quick note on pricing and
availability at the time of filming this
there were none available so that's very
unfortunate and it's been that way since
copy Lake launched so definitely
disappointing to see that again
theoretically this is a mature process
theoretically Intel should be able to
start pumping them out on mass but we'll
see whether they actually do as of now
it's pretty hard to get if you've been
waiting for a coffee like CPU any of
them the word we've received is that
they generally restock at major at least
US retailers about every other week once
per week so if you don't see it check
every week and hopefully you'll see one
pop up but that's all for now as always
