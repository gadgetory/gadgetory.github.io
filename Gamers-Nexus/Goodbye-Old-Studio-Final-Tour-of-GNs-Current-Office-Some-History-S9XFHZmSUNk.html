for gamers Nexus we're getting an office
a proper office allow us to expand our
technical depth a lot do way more
technical testing because we're
completely out of space and up until
this point I've been running it out of
my house for 10 years now we have
multiple employees we have a lot of test
machines so we gotta solve the problem
but the office is going to have a moving
n vlog and this will be part one and as
part of part one I would like to
demonstrate to you now how and why we
are completely out of space and why we
actually need the office before that
this video is brought to you by Dollar
Shave club's daily essentials starter
set this full grooming kit ships at five
dollars and includes a trial sized
versions of the companies at popular
shave butter body wash and wipes and
also includes a solid high quality razor
and a full set of cartridges go to
dollarshaveclub.com slash gamers nexus
to get the daily essentials starter kit
for just $5 and with free shipping or
click the link below it's a quick cut to
this video to interject something else I
debated a lot whether I wanted to
include this part of the video because
it's a bit more personal I don't like
sharing that I don't think it really has
a place on the channel my vision of
gamers Nexus is that it's like strictly
coverage of stuff on in the hardware
world and that shouldn't involve
personal things but this is a pretty
special occasion for us moving in an
office is a much greater step than any
of you can ever imagine for us and it's
for a lot of reasons so I knew what the
counts would have been like we we owe it
to everybody especially I owe it to
myself to do a full tour of this place
before we tear it all down because I
mean I've spent ten years building a
business here and I started as just a
website by myself and I ran it by myself
for years and years and we hired people
and just historically we owe it to
everybody and viewers especially to do
the tour but I knew that the comments
would be a lot more a lot less
understanding then they should be
if I didn't give context to why we're
operating the way we are so despite not
wanting to give this context publicly
necessarily it's worth it I think later
on when I watch this in 15 years or
whatever I'll be glad I did it but I
just kind of want to say like I hesitate
to put this part out there but we're
gonna do it anyway because it is a
special occasion and hopefully most of
you watching are really into the stuff
we do so right so first first major
thing here I was originally looking at
offices about three years ago and was
supposed to move into one around then we
had a few good options nothing nearly as
good as what we can move into an
affordance
it's not extravagant what we're doing
now but the point is the size difference
would have been substantial if I moved
somewhere three years ago but I had to
assume payments for this house from my
mom's house because my dad died and so
because of that it was rather unexpected
because of that extra hurtle to get
around obviously I gave up the search
for an office because three years ago I
was getting to a point where I was like
you know it's time time to do this time
to really get moving get out of here do
my own thing grow the business and just
push and it worked out pretty well all
things considered but I just wanted to
say you know there's his reason been
here so long and I basically I took over
the payments for everything and made
sure everyone was as comfortable as they
could be given the circumstances so that
was my promise I made to him was that I
would take care of all this and make
sure that he had nothing to worry about
so that's that's the context I wanted to
provide because I knew otherwise people
are gonna look at like how crowded is in
the rooms and how there's personal stuff
that mixed with business stuff and
there's a lot of my personal stuff
they're going to comment on it without
really understanding why it's there any
of the point is it's because all this
was unexpected we didn't expect to be
here to be stuck here and so we had to
grow into the space and we'll do the
whole tour in a minute but this is
important
had to grow into the space had if you've
ever grown a business out of your house
where you live the business consumes
everything
it starts taking over every every single
spot in the house everything in your
life and that's fine I like it I welcome
it and it's what I enjoy but the point
is that you starts pushing kind of your
stuff further and further to the
perimeter of things as you move business
stuff in especially in a business where
our job is receive things and then work
with them so yeah that was that was the
big holdup and I wanted to provide the
context and I that is the the start and
end of the context I will provide so
appreciate anything you might say but
it's it's okay it was a while ago we're
good so I just wanted to get that out
there so next major thing had to put
notes on has been a long time we start
with just one room it's the room you'll
seen a bit in the production room where
in this video I already filmed it
obviously Patrick and Keegan are working
in there in this video that's the
production room it all started there it
was just maybe maybe I'll go find some
b-roll clips or something just me and
total mess in there of course and
because I've always had a space issue
what we want anymore
and I would build systems on the floor
and that's hard we do my reviews most
the stuff I mean I'm not gonna do the
whole history of g.n right now but as we
start getting products in I'd work with
it on the floor and eventually I upgrade
it and the upgrade was to buy a folding
table like a card table and put it in
the corner of that room where there was
no space for that but it's better than
building on the floor it sounds like the
first major upgrade and at some point I
was like you know what that needs a
white tablecloth on it because all the
black components aren't showing up with
my garbage camera so I need a contrast
and that's how I created it eventually
the dresser was pulled out my dresser
was pulled out of there and I've got a
training table I put it in but just like
a work table and that was a major
expansion for us and these things start
to click you start going wow I could see
how this could get really fun to like
expand and have like dedicated spaces
for everything I really like this let's
do more of it and so I think what's the
timeline from here that was my first big
set upgrade so to speak what are the
next upgrades after that so when I
pulled the dresser out and put that
training table and that's where Keegan
began to come in and regularly edit
previously he had just done trade shows
with me maybe once or twice now it
doesn't all the time so that's right
when he really started contributing
about a year later Andrew joined the
team in a fuller capacity about probably
part time to start full-time later and
at that point we started moving I was
forced to add another work table so we
pulled more of my stuff out put it in
boxes put on whatever shelves around the
room and pushed it all to the perimeter
put another work table in after this we
expanded into the room that we're in
right now this one and the to my right
there was my dresser a big armoire
basically and we put in a card table
next to it the same one because that
apparently deserves to be kept put that
next to it put a gray sheet on this wall
before we realized though just paint it
won't look stupid and that was the set
and I think even bought like a light I
think that's kind of the route we took
so after this move we made a big move to
build our wood wall which is over there
still and it's rather simple but it was
actually really critical and a lot of
people really liked it some people
thought it was just kind of lame or
boring and I grew up both of you
I really liked it I agree that it's
bland but it was critical to what we do
because that was another moment when I
put that wall in after working on it
with Patrick stone still he's helping us
with this office we're here with Patrick
stone late one night and put it up and I
was just so happy to have it there
because this it was like partly assemble
this I think I accelerated the timeline
a bit but partly so that was the first
thing that went in after my dad passed
away first thing that major thing I did
to change because that's when I kind of
realized given the circumstances of then
we're like panicking like how do I get
enough money to make sure everyone's
comfortable in the family see go into
overdrive like okay I need I need to
overhaul everything I need a set I need
a space I can work and this is
video space and that's it that's all it
is the lights never move camera doesn't
move that's what it does it does one
thing and it's sit here and be ready for
me to shoot a video so that was the like
that we need to we need to go it's go
time put the wall and made me really
happy just to have a spot to go to shoot
videos and I think from there it just
started snowballing we got a lot of
support time and time again from all the
videos we launched this room eventually
got a test bench added to it over there
you'll see it in this video if you
haven't already and about a year later
after all this Patrick Nathan joined the
team full-time programming and testing
writing for us and so at that point we
were of course take over the last room
we had available for work like the last
the last room that I could use for work
and still have separate bedrooms
basically so that one is only half full
it's filled with like other storage
house storage stuff like that so really
we have two and a half rooms is what
you're gonna see here and it's got
personal stuff in it and I would ask
that you just be respectful because like
I really don't want to do the tour in
some ways but I really want to because
it's so important to me to show where we
came from for myself when I look back
later just realized I'm missing a light
sorry
should put that light on for myself and
also for everyone else who's been with
us a long time I think we just know it
to everyone to see what where we came
from so you know keep that in mind be
please respectful the house that we're
gonna walk through and then we'll show
the new office I'm really excited to
show you all and I'm gonna stop wasting
everyone's time this gonna be a long
video just because of this segue but it
is what it is so yeah let's let's get
back into the main cut with with the
light that I forgot to turn back on
so our video set room isn't even a
dedicated set room we have a couple test
benches in here we have this one this is
the longest standing bench in GN history
that's still operational it's our cooler
bench and it's about six feet away from
where I stand for the videos so there's
testing equipment in the same room as
the video equipment there are lights
everywhere
as you saw that gag at the beginning
it's not just a gag I have to duck under
the lights to navigate to the room it's
a problem if Patrick comes in here to
tear down a system on the testbench
table or the livestream table then we
have to schedule around that to make
sure we can still film on the same day
so this is not us expanding to be
extravagant we're not overspending we're
getting a space that's exactly perfect
for our needs and won't put us any under
any pressure I want to make sure we're
all clear on this it does not put us
under any editorial pressure to change
our type of content in fact it will make
the content better I'm sure you hear
that a lot in this case it's definitely
true because if I want to do cooler
testing I have the bench here but then
if I want to change like fan testing or
power supply testing something has to be
torn down and that restricts us
significantly on what we can do that's
why fan testing hasn't happened yet
that's why power supply testing hasn't
happened yet we do not have the space so
this is like the old tool wall that I
put in for one of our contractors done
work for us Mike he wanted a tool wall
so it was a big deal to put that in he
wanted this fold out banz which has also
been great so we put that in and that's
currently kind of set up for fantastic
but as you can see it's it's basically
inaccessible because there's a light
there so I have to move the light to get
to that bench which then means that
there's now a slight delay in shooting a
video because the lights not where it
should be so there are a lot of problems
here and the other thing let's just can
we show the tests the stream set up on
the floor under the bench sorry for the
camera shake this is a hard shot for
have been down so that's our one is
storage and two that's the live
streaming computer so this enters
another problem with our current setup
we want to do more live streams people
love them I really enjoy doing them we
get a lot of viewers and it's just fun
but to do a live stream right now
requires like two hours on either end of
the stream to setup and teardown and we
can just make this part of the video
so part of the problem with that is yeah
I've got a Hall monitors in from over
there another room bring them in here
put two monitors on the table and build
the system under the table put a bench
where the fantastic stuff is resides to
move all that stuff and so that whole
process is like two hours just to do a
stream so the stream better damn be like
four hours otherwise it's not worth it
and now we're going to be moving into a
place where we'll have the a roll set
dedicated in its own spot and next to it
a streaming set dedicated its own spot
and we won't have to tear stuff down
including test benches like this one or
that one but we want to do videos so
this is just one room we have three
rooms in this house plus storage like
all the cases if you want over the cases
go up until the point that I get rid of
them they go up in the attic
basically the we've cut I don't know
it's just every square inch is taken so
we have three rooms that we kind of work
out of two that are fully dedicated as a
GN and those rooms are not that big
there are small bedrooms so that's part
of the problem that we're dealing with
and this will show a teaser clip of the
office now I guess but we're sometime in
this intro but the office video will
show you how that's going to work out
there's just basically a giant room
that'll be just for video and then set
lasers for testing things like that so
we really nice compartmentalized stuff
but I mean there's no floor space
anymore
there's no anything space so this is the
main room this is where videos have been
shot since probably about 2000 14 or 15
up until then everything was out of one
room and I'll give you at some point in
this video I might edit it myself but
I'll do a quick GN history walkthrough
of all our sets and things like that cuz
I'm the only one who's been here for a
hundred of them so I'll go back and find
some old videos and show you what it
used to look like but anyway let's go
look at the other two rooms we have the
main production room and then we have
like the kind of spare room where case
testing happens and we're currently we
have a temporary test or actually video
editing setup where there should be a
testing setup but it's impermanent
because of how little space we have so
let's go check out the production room
sorry go ahead okay so this is the main
production room you've seen it in a few
videos typically it's just me and here
it's showing like a video card shelf
over there or something but Patrick's in
here hi Patrick
Keegan's in here editing the other the
second part of the video you're watching
part one now so that's the second part
that's the teaser of the office so yeah
main production room the problems here
same problems basically that just has to
be torn down all the time to make space
Patrick's setup is kind of another
impermanent one where we've got like a
test bench there and a capture system
over there in the shelf and then working
off a laptop so we want to actually have
like a permanent workstation instead of
that and then this bench constantly gets
torn down for different tests which with
the new office we'll be able to actually
have like multiple tables and test
benches so they don't have to get torn
down all the time and we can actually
keep them built to produce content we're
rapidly and with greater depth so that's
a big deal for us with the office move
but to give you a quick tour of this one
I guess we have like Maine original test
bench platform here plus whatever is
being tested at the time you know
current clamp rubbing alcohol the
necessary tools then we have another
test bench over there we have a mast
right here which is kind of in pieces
right now and then basically the way it
ends up working is if like three people
are in we can't have four people in this
room so that's a problem I have three
people are in this room and say
someone's here working and I'm here
working and Kegan or Andrew they're
working the chairs are almost literally
touching each other so yeah there's your
your square footage between the chairs
is pretty minimal inhibits movement big
kind of annoyance there's just we just
don't have anywhere to put stuff at this
point and then this is the video card
shelf which you've seen before see I
mean video card shelf capture system CDs
RAM all that stuff so we'll be able to
organize that more efficiently in the
future but basically this room is like
test bench test bench
machine capture machine plus gpgc SRAM
and which are difficult to access if
someone's working here and sons working
here production system for me and I
guess that pretty much covers the room
so pretty small so we go over to the
last room now but yeah production
systems are just meeting in more space
for them as is evidenced by single
screen setup from even though it's an
ultra wide so this is part of the
problem right now cases in the hallway
parts in the hallway because these are
either ready to go into the attic or at
this point is just a mess cuz we're
gonna move anyways so might as well just
wait and it's also a mess because it was
basically storage and now it's become
storage and working space because we
needed a few things we needed a build
station for Patrick to work on building
on building systems when he didn't use
the set room so that's what this was
originally plus power supply testing
Keegan was working on a task GN on here
so he's got asked UN questions up so you
can see we've got like basically what
was supposed to be just a build station
plus power supply testing which got set
back for the fire issue also became a
laptop that's docked for an editing
station when we have too many people
here and we just can't physically fit
four people in the other room so that
meant we lost our new build station
obviously there's a problem this is the
case testing bench
so yeah the case has bench components
are here right now and whenever we build
the system these go in the other room or
they go there to the build station if we
can clear it off and then the case that
gets tested goes right here and gets
tested so there's a liquid cooling shelf
all the CL see is that we've tested
recently and thus presents yet another
one of the issues of storage so you know
this is a problem where we basically
once a month I'll spend a lot of time
organizing everything I haven't done it
for the last two months because we're
moving so what's the point and my hope
is that I won't have to do all that time
organizing if we just have a ton of
shelves and
worktables so that stuff can find a
place without having to play Tetris
every time we need to move things around
so yeah that's uh that's pretty much
it's pretty much the room the spare half
way used room so that's what we're
dealing with that's why we're moving I
figured that'd out for one sentimental
to historical and three practical
reasons figured we'd show where we are
now we'll be nice to say this is what we
came from and for like ten years and
also just to make sure everyone's on the
same page because I've seen the comments
when jazz moves when lionesses moved
when Kyle's moves I've seen all the
comments I know what the narrative is
and gesture we're all on the same page
hopefully it's clear now we need to have
a proper space to work this is just like
it it was easier to manage the
organization and the stuff we had when
we weren't getting stuff in every single
day from manufacturers or from Amazon or
whatever for work and there's so much
stuff coming and now that we don't even
have space for a swap space to like put
stuff in that's coming in and stuff
that's going out to get rid of it make
space there's there's
can't work anymore with that with this
amount of space so and this shelf was
like a last-ditch effort to get some
more space and it helped a lot but we
need more than that
and clearly we've got like I get rid of
cases all the time I get rid of carbon
boxes as soon as they arrive all that
stuff but there's just too many projects
going on at once and here's the other
thing it's not just how much stuff we
have because we can get rid of that it's
how much stuff we have that's pending
review and if we have more test benches
set up this isn't a the the solution to
our problem is not well you should just
get rid of some of that stuff because
that doesn't work one the things that we
have make us money by making reviews
stuff like that - the amount of stuff
that needs to be reviewed can't it just
you can't go out the door until we're
done with it and I can get done with
stuff faster if I have a lot
test bench is set up next to each other
so my hope is to have like eight or ten
of them set up ready to go at a moment's
notice and test the component do the
review and get it out the door or keep
it if we want to keep it for some reason
so yeah check back for part two to see
what the office will look like we've
just just shot a video like you saw
keegan was working on in this one
that'll show the office empty before we
move stuff in then we're gonna do a
moving vlog while we move stuff in wire
it up for cat6 all that stuff so thank
you for watching thank you for
supporting us over the last ten years
for those of you who've been here a long
time I'm curious see how when you found
us if you remember post a comment below
and say kind of what subscriber count'
we were at at the time that you started
watching our videos or subscribing or if
you were here before we even did YouTube
because there was a website long before
we did just YouTube content on a daily
basis and now we try to balance them but
if you've been around a long time let us
