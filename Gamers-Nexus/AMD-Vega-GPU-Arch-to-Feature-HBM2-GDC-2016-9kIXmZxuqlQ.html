dotnet and we were here at GDC 2016 and
we just got back from the capsaicin
event last night put on by AMD and we
spoke to a few people from andy at the
event about some of the new
architectures dx12 and virtual reality
but before getting to our new coverage
today on hbm too pretty important stuff
all of this GDC 2016 coverage is brought
to you by raw Furies goner platformer
game it's a new indie platformer game
that you're seeing on the screen now the
new architecture that's of most
importance immediately anyway is of
course Polaris and that's the one that
we saw at CES where Andy had a
side-by-side with an unnamed Polaris GPU
against a GTX 950 and they were showing
off sort of a kilowatt performance so
it's a per per watt item that andy has
been really big on showing off lately
and with Polaris there's an expected 2.5
x gained over the current architectures
and then going into viga that's in the
next one and after that is na'vi going
into viga there's what looks like an hbm
version 2 integration that's pretty big
news the first version of hbm was on
fury where the fury x cards and that was
the Fiji architecture and hbm for those
who don't know is memory that is
physically on the die of the GPU and
that makes it much faster it's actually
significantly faster than something like
g ddr and going into hbm to there's
still an expected something like 2x
gained over HB m14 memory bandwidth and
that as i said was on the slide for
andy's roadmap presentation of their GPU
architecture in the immediate future
following this is na'vi and navy has a
couple more ambiguous notes in the chart
but it shows what basically says
scalability and then a new type of
memory which is completely unnamed we
would expect it would obviously be
something other than hbm to since hbm to
was explicitly named in the slide and
then polaris we would expect would not
have hbm to again wasn't explicitly
mentioned doesn't seem like the kind of
thing that you would do if your listing
it for viga so polaris looks like
probably an HB m1 maybe some gddr5 or
gddr5 x thrown in there like Pascal is
doing with GP 104
but other than that the thing to look
forward to right now is a viga in terms
of and these next big memory
implementation and that will bring viga
up to parity with Nvidia's impending
Pascal also do this year so both of
those two GPU architecture should be due
sometime this year and we'll both
include hbm to on some level check the
link the description below for more
information on this and of course check
our other coverage where we talk to Roy
Taylor and we've got something going up
where we talked to Scott Watson former
tech report and now AMD that's all going
on later today so check that out in the
channel thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
