card as noted in the review it had some
thermal limitations with the clock the
clock boosting behavior was not ideal
with one of these on it we kind of proof
of concept is this plan by throwing the
fan speed to 80 percent but that's way
to labs bare so we fix it by adding a
liquid cooler instead before getting to
that this coverage is brought to you by
EVGA and their closed-loop liquid
cooling kits you can buy the 1080 model
and it will still work with this the
showers and Pat ability isn't always
perfect but the liquid cooler will work
just fine on one of these so if you want
to do your mod the way we did ours you
can grab one of those kits that link to
the description below and throw it on by
following our first and second videos as
guides so now that we've got that
covered this project was a bit different
from our previous hybrid builds and the
way it was different is sort of exciting
we added these thermocouples to the sets
and back side of the PCB which is
something that I've been doing for a
little while now and GPU stuff since the
EVGA vrm testing we did and later some
other PCB and backplate tests that have
been published since adding those allows
us to see one really interesting metric
that we haven't seen before which is
does adding one of these negatively
impact the temperature of the vrm
components the MOSFETs and the backplate
or anything like that as a back side of
the PCB because we're taking away this
this is a pretty large anyway for for a
counters addition card pretty large air
cooler it's just a heat sink with a
vapor chamber in it pulling that off
means we lose some of our service area
and means that the fan and here it
becomes less efficient at what it's
trying to do that said the base plate of
the card is still pretty damn big it's
still a big metal base plate it's still
connected by a lot of thermal pads to
the components underneath and we still
have a blower fan on the vrm that can
now spin out at a lower rpm which again
is PWM controlled by the GPU so that's
another potential concern because now
your blower fan spins up something like
22 percent because the GP is always
under 50 by way of using a liquid cooler
so there's a lot of interesting concerns
with regard to vrm temperatures as a
result of improving GP temperatures
improving GP temperatures can worsen
vrm temperatures because the PWM
controlled
erm blower fan slaves to the GPU
temperature the diode that outputs the
GPU temperatures so very interesting
stuff to test and we have thermal
results we have clock frequency
stability over time and then we've got
some gaming FPS results as well for volt
testing methodology as always hit the
link in the description below to the
article that contains a fairly sizable
section on how the thermal tests are
conducted one note I really want to add
vram testing as well that wasn't done
for this one but looking at it for the
future is just a matter of upgrading the
thermocouple readers at this point
basically but we have the arms covered
that's all discussed in the testing
methodology game test methods are also
down there as well as the CPU using the
bench ram all that stuff find that in
the link below let's get into it with
thermals this chart has a lot going on
so breaking it down one line at a time
first all the top lines in the legend
that represent the TI founders Edition
card without our fix or cooler or hack
jobs whatever you may call it including
the green line representing GPU core
temperature that green line sits around
84 see in this endurance test which is
NVIDIA thermal limit point under stock
conditions the card will not allow the
frequency to boost to a point that
forces temperature beyond 84 C looking
at the GN a hybrid variants of the same
card same PCB and same GPU the actual
GPU
nothing's change I was only cooler or
clearly at around 45 C that is
substantial and we're looking at a 40 C
reduction in temperature there is a
further benefit spreading the frequency
boosting Headroom which we will look at
in a moment the big question here is
whether removing the vapor chamber and
heatsink negatively impacts that cooling
my card still has that massive base
plate as discussed but we lose the
heatsink the short answer is no the big
cluster of lines in the 65 to 70 C range
represents the fat to and set seven
temperatures for both revisions of the
TI card there is no significant
difference we can't even really see one
line for the other in this mess of them
because they're all about the same
temperature and for the fats we
monitored it's fair to say that the
temperature is effectively equal to the
founders edition card unmodified even if
there were an increase it would have to
be substantial to cause any concern the
RM components can take a lot of heat
upwards of one
five to 150 see in some cases most cases
really ideally though we're lower than
that to reduce D rating or inefficiently
concerned and we are well below that
range with these results after the
impact on thermals at vs. at clock rates
we can already hypothesize that e clock
will be flatter and less paretic in its
fluctuations went on to liquid this
conclusion can be formed just by looking
at the previous frequency chart from the
ten atti review we're running an 80% but
sort of intolerable fan speed cloud for
greater performance in the boosting
behavior of course this also introduces
an unbearable level of noise and so
isn't accessible for long up times in
fact the fan never jumps that high from
the stock and Vidia fan speed curve to
begin with attempts the plateau around
fifty to fifty-five percent so even the
stock curve it really doesn't want you
to go beyond that unless it's absolutely
necessary much for noise reasons well
could have a new frequency versus time
and temperature charge moving off the
old one we see the pink line
representing the GN hybrid 1080i which
is able to sustain a higher clock
overall and a flatter line that's a good
thing there's a lot less fluctuation
here keep in mind that has stated
previously this is with a power virus
test we're mostly burning the FETs here
and so the cores don't boost as high as
they would in a real-world video game
test
despite being burned at hotter than any
other application for thermals we see
the GN hybrid card operating below 50 c
generally in the 45 t range was a PE
version of the same GPM PCB at around 65
celsius won at 80% fan speed or 84 when
at auto speeds and that would probably
be worse if we were allowed to boost
frequency to the same frequencies as in
the hybrid version clause fluctuation is
that no more than 30 megahertz in the
worst cases on the hybrid card which is
a pretty market improvement over the
stock founders vision card going into
FPS tests the things and out here that's
most interesting is this card the hybrid
version we've built of the founders
edition 1080 TI is capable without an
overclock applied manually of boosting
higher than the stock settings that is
because that we removed the thermal
limit so we're going to be testing this
no overclocked stock versus the stock
1080i with the
cooling set up this and we'll be able to
see it's just doing the model with no
overclocking improves performance it
does and then we'll add an overclock for
a couple of games on this that are not
going too deep on it today that's still
another topic we'll look at a few games
though starting our FPS performance
testing with Ghost Recon wildlands at 4k
and very high settings we see the gtx
980ti is outperformed by our stock 1080
TI hybrid mod that's without any
overclock supplied this is because again
the thermal limiter has been removed so
the GPU can boost higher clocks when the
FE cooler would allow this result would
be more exaggerated at least to some
extent as play time extends our FPS
difference ends up being 55 FPS average
at verses 57 so too when only the cooler
is exchanged lows also improved
marginally from 45 and 42 to 51 and 47
and overclocked in the GN hybrid with a
150 megahertz offset and a 4 50
megahertz memory offset and our
frequency in the range of 1952 20 50
mega Hertz depending on workload and
voltage and power limitations that lands
performance at about 60 FPS average
that's an increase of approximately 9%
over the stock at ecard or an increase
of about 5.8 percent over the GN hybrid
stock card
moving on to 1440p we see the GN hybrid
model again outperform the stock TI by
just a couple FPS and no this is not
within margin of error the difference is
repeatable and measurable lows improve
to 81 and 77 fps from 24 and 66 fps
overclocked in the 1080i hybrid puts us
up to 98 FPS average though the 0.1%
values do reveal that our clock is
bordering instability here have some of
the lower values in that category
backing down on the 150 megahertz core
and for 50 megahertz that memory offsets
would improve this metric a bit though
you do lose some in the average
department finally 1080p shows that the
1080i is genuinely capable of hitting
120 FPS average in this game at four
lovers of high refresh displays at the
setting under the right conditions in
this case those conditions are the GN
hybrid card we can push to 120 FPS from
the stock cards 115 average with lows
also improves markedly overclocking our
hybrid pushes us to nearly 1
six FPS average that's an improvement of
about nine percent of the stock MTV gif
ecard or about five percent over the GN
hybrid with no OC looking at for honor
with extreme settings next 4k positions
the 1080 TI f e at 66 FPS average
superseded by the GN hybrid at 70 FPS
average that's an increase of about 6
percent just by changing the coolers and
is indicative of the kind of performance
gains you should expect from a IV
partner models of the 1080p I
overclocked in our hybrid we land at 76
FPS average or about 15.6 percent faster
than the FPS card pretty impressive
or 9% faster than the GM hybrid stock
card lows exhibits the same behavior as
previously noted at 14 at 40 P is a
hybrid model with an overclocked four
pals our 1080 TI up to the 144 Hertz
range now achieving 148 FPS average
versus the 130 average of a stock F II
card or 137 of the iris stock card low
scale mostly linearly except for the
0.1% metrics again this changed and
that's us a 14% increase in performance
over the completely stock FP card
looking at averages that would be non
overclocked hybrid is about 5% better
than being non overclocked to F II card
1080p is sort of comical with this came
but we're still testing it for a
baseline for the vast majority of people
still on 1080p displays at 1080p the non
overclocked to GN hybrid posts a
performance gain of about 5.2 percent of
the stock F II card with no improvement
in blows the overclocked variant posts a
gain of about 20 FPS or around 10
percent over the stock F II card about
5% over the hybrid stock card let's move
on to doom looking at doom with Vulcan
and 4k resolution we see the 1080 TI
reference card at 90 FPS average
outperformed by the 1080p IGN hybrid by
about 5.8 percent our lows also
increased marginally and this is fairly
consistent in terms of percentage gains
when looking at previous tests
this shows a continued at 5 to 6%
increase in the head room when better
coolers come into play we've also got
1440p and 1080p numbers were doomed
published on the website if you're
curious
that's linked in the description below
let's do one more with Sniper Elite
we've got ashes and synthetic tests
alongside the other 14 14 10 a t-test in
the article link below again
for more results at 4k with high
settings with dec 12 and 18 can abled at
the 1080 TIG and hybrid push is 84 fps
was low at 67 and 65 comparatively the
1080 TI fe card runs at 76 FPS average
at 64 1% lows and 60 10.1% lows the
difference of averages is about 10.5%
for one of the more substantial games
we've measured so that was pretty fun
test the thing that I was actually
really interested in was just the vrm
testing stuff in terms of the phat
thermals I really want to do the RAM
testing in the future but we need to
upgrade some equipment so that I can
have more thermocouple running
simultaneously because we're maxed out
at 4 right now overall the results look
good this does a few things for us one
if you don't want to do this that's fine
just know that the five to six percent
gains we see in most cases stock with a
better cooler should be representative
of what you'll be seen in a couple of
weeks when the AIB partner models roll
out those obviously might have some pre
overclocks that changes things but if
you're strictly looking at the cooler
with the same clock configuration other
than boost behavior this is
representative of what you'll see there
in terms of overclocking and doing this
we get a lot of headroom now of course
you could overclocked at 1080p IFE as
well and we still need to do some of
that it doesn't really really packed
lately with trips but overall this
project definitely is worth it for a bit
of fun if you like doing this kind of
thing if you'd prefer not to
then wait around for AIB models if you
are actually buying a ton of UTI check
our review to see if that's if it's a
good buy for you but a Ivy models will
do more or less the same thing just
without the effort involved if you're ok
with doing the effort and bind I don't
know if this helps for now it's
generally is about a hundred dollars
buying a hundred dollar kit is a fun
project it's not too hard to do if you
watch our videos and the performance
gain and thermals is tremendous 40
Celsius in the core clock about the same
for the FETs
the performance gain and stock frequency
is also noteworthy couple percent 5 6
percent most games I've stated sometimes
more and then the overclocking Headroom
is also improved because we've removed
some of the thermal limitation and the
sets do just fine for the most part well
actually they do just fine period though
we still need to measure
