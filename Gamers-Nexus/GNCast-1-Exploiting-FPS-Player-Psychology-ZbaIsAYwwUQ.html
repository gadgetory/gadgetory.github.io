don√≠t and i am joined by linda and this
is new for us we're gonna do kind of a
always podcast style yeah just talking
about something we've been talking about
off-camera lately which is the
exploitation of player psychology fun
stuff once the ass so if you like if you
end up liking this discussion please
leave a comment below let us know if you
liked it or if you didn't and we'll work
on doing more of these in the future you
have topic ideas let us now or if you
just want to contribute to what we're
talking about him will read them also
absolutely so lately about we've both
done planes on the new games yes black
ops there's battlefront yes it's been a
little bit of time with black ops not as
much with battlefront that is that is on
my plate he's on my plate but spend a
little bit of time with those yeah so
with with battlefront you're playing at
the other day on one of our bench ray
yes I was and that's that's one of those
games where I think you were on maybe it
was an end or I was on an indoor plant
Walker assault right which was a new new
boat for me is very interesting it's
it's almost like a it's a very very busy
modo mode that I can find myself
enjoying a little bit which actually is
very very different when you start
talking about ecology because there
isn't a mode on black ops or on a call
to detail that I can recall that
requires you to protect something but
also disable around get access to
certain points on the way while also
again also like fending off an entire
team do a la position I can't think of a
mode and called you that does that but
that was a lot of fun yeah well as
supremacy is really good too and the the
one point I think I remember you
mentioning was players who continually
take the same path even though on Endor
you've got you have million trees he can
run through yes and yeah like even you
and I are definitely I was sitting there
noticing like why am I going through the
same place every time
so on yeah when I still dying yes now
again two totally different games with 2
totally I think different approaches
depending on which map you are on
obviously black ops it's always been an
entertaining for me and this is coming
from from a mediocre black cause you to
player i I'm hovering around the the one
point okay right now but that being said
I think everybody has that game where
they go 22 and 25 I think sometimes the
mistake people make is after a couple
games like that they go okay that thing
works I'm gonna stick to that and I
think that's where some of the average
players like myself can take advantage
of it because I think people sometimes
get stuck in their ways there's a cover
it a little bit yeah counter-strike is
the one that i play mostly these days
and it's the same thing where with
counter-strike it's a little different
because you have a set strategy that
your team is probably I'm cute in and
depend which team you're on the ground
cts the counter-terrorist you pretty
much know we need this many people i
beez many people a day you gotta admit
if you run dust too and so the other
team knows you're going to be in those
positions yep but I think maybe the
reason it works in that kind of game
versus black ops black ops you repeat
the same thing over you just get killed
yes but i guess in counter-strike maybe
it's a little slower paced or there's
more like peeking on the corner it's
much more methodical and it's it's
something that often times especially if
i switch from a game that is squad-based
to or a game that is centered around a
strategy to a game where if you're just
jump in if like if you don't play with a
clan if you don't play with a regular
group of friends it can be frustrating
it away because there is an asthma that
methodical operation to you know
achieving your goal whereas we were
talking about this the other day you can
take advantage of somebody who's stuck
in their ways or is on a team that is
that with people they don't normally
play with because and i'll give you
example i think one of the things i
brought up was a map called standoff on
black ops 2 had to be one of my favorite
favorite maps because that was the map
every time the loading screen for
standoff will come up I knew I'd be able
to take advantage as MP
would just get there's really only three
routes you can take on that map right
and moat in a lot of maps are like this
where it's a you got you got an option
you left right and go min and i'm black
ops 2 that was one of the mats where i
would take advantage of the people who
are stuck in their ways people come
around the corner and like I'm a sniper
okay that's I love that's what I love
doing that's one thing that I am
consistently Narron teams got that good
and I am that guy I am the guy and if
for those of you out there you should
you struggle with this you've been
caught out for this listen imma clarify
it now if you have a weapon and it has a
scope on it you can't be accused of
camping there's no such thing there's no
such thing what thing is if you had a
scope weapon and you are in a window or
at any kind of vantage point you're not
camping and if somebody comes around the
corner and gets killed by you five times
it's not your fault in that place there
yeah but it's funny because I think a
lot of times people do they have those
three options and they have a game where
they do very very well where they have a
couple games that you very well and they
get locked in this thing was like okay
that's the thing that's going to work
and I come in or the average player come
in again you know I'm just going to take
advantage of the people who think they
can do the same thing over and over
again and get this all so why do players
repeat the same movement it's like we
were talking to uh type of games about
this with heat maps and I what's up with
you as well Activision does it epic game
says these companies that they produce
heat maps it's actually really cool you
look it up it's fascinating yeah so it
shows like any other sort of topography
map shows like red blue orange based on
how popular spot is yeah and so
Activision has a whole game Science
Division devoted to this Patrick stone
for a website wrote a pretty extensive
article about it and all it does is
talks about how we collect all this data
we be an Activision collect all this
data on the weapon to use yep where you
throw your grenades how long you hold
them yo family what past you take on the
maps and so obviously they've got their
whole scientifically backed thought
process on how do we get people to use
this whole map space but from our
perspective as players what is it you
think
make someone say I'm going to keep going
that way I don't care about the dude in
the window who's camping yep what why
why oh man I've as I've gotten older I
think as my brain develops funny you
come at games from a different angle you
do that when you were 14 15 especially
shooters obviously it depends on the
mode like I'm a team team deathmatch
hardcore guy where I think what happens
in modes were just the objective is to
take out the other team the temptation
is to just get out into the fray as
quickly as possible and don't do a ton
of thinking until you have to aim down
this ape down your sights I think that's
one of them I think honestly I think we
do i think when we find something that
quote unquote works we tend to stick to
it and right then there because there's
a learning curve that's involved with
trying something new and it's crazy i'd
be having this conversation in an
association of with video games but it
can like if you're playing it with call
duty mats or not that big even though
they've got a bigger / / past has titles
they're really not that big and your
options even though you have more are
still not quite to the level of again we
talked earlier about indoor which is
literally you spawn and you might have
to travel a bit before your eyes see
somebody like need a title field yes
exactly and again something that dice
prides itself in especially on the pc
version oh yeah where strategy is much
more involved because of the amount of
space in it map I think people get
locked into their ways because the
options are limited and if they find
again if they've got one of three or
four even five and they find one that
works even fifty percent of the time I
think it's something that people are
just gonna go you know I'm gonna do that
instead of learning how to do something
else yeah that's an interesting point
with the bigger games too cuz with
battlefield and battlefront the maps so
big it's almost like you want to get
your value out of that spawn yes because
next time you spawn you I have to travel
for 30 seconds yes a game is eternity
yeah absolutely that's that's an
interesting way to look at it too is
getting your value but we were talking
about stubbornness as well yeah pure
yeah screw that guy yeah yeah I'm gonna
get him yes relos is my favorite like
something's gonna go wrong his my
favorite mean I had to I had to humble
myself I hey um and that was I think
that was when I got okay that she's
because it you know there was a time
when I was terrible at them and when i
upgrade from terrible to okay was when i
was actually willing to put my pride
aside because one of the things that can
be the most frustrating for those of you
out there who play FPS games is coming
around the corner and that person knows
you're coming and you get blasted right
out and right out the bat i think for a
lot of you all the temptations want to
go i'm gonna go to the same spot and i'm
going to be faster yeah i'm going to be
better than that I'm understand jumped
and I'm gonna crowd yes I'm gonna do
whatever and I'm the guy in the window
just like you can do whatever you want
to do as a matter of fact it's great I
wanted this thing that is I didn't
really think about it so I got older but
if I was staying in the window I would
take a shot and if I would get one
killer may be too and I was literally
through the scope I'll just move like a
foot to the rider with the left and it
changed everything up and it's I think
sometimes you just got to put your pride
aside and be like you know what I've
already been killed by Saint got the
same spot three times maybe I should
think about doing something ass well it
sounds silly to but the same thing for
me was with cs go I sort of graduated in
in levels in that game by just stopping
and thinking about like what am I trying
to accomplish this and can I do it a
different way yeah and I think once
you're sort of sucked into the game and
focused on getting killed or on killings
increase your score like as soon as you
focus on your score just like in school
as soon as you focus on your grade you
start losing sight of the bigger picture
yes actually learning about the
experience yes I find it to be
especially frustrating because and I'll
think purest is even the right word I am
a competitive person would it be with
sports or eSports it doesn't even really
matter
I'm a competitive person I played a
windy game and I do it with games like
this I do care about score per second I
care a little bit more or score per
minute more accurately and do care about
kill to death ratio right but ultimately
for me and this is just me like I want
to win the game at the end I want to be
on the team that won the game and what
frustrates me and this is this is again
this is opinion this is all based on
just like mine ticular play style but
what frustrates me is when you're
playing with the people who are just in
the game to like level up weapons so you
have the person that's running around
the RPG and like go to and 16 over the
course of that is like you're not
helping anyone by this like your file
feels like we're probably gonna lose
because you wanted to die 16 times
because you needed to get a couple extra
kills you are at fiji drives me nuts but
yeah that's it's funny that's just me
but I play I play to win the game and
depending on who you're playing with the
cum the way that you play the game and
the style of the gameplay can change
even if you've been playing they're deaf
as you can play domination of some of
that it dude all really depends who
you're playing with what their goals are
and what game you're playing yeah i
remember playing call of duty for which
at the time was my favorite shooter of
all time yes and that had for pc a mod
called Pro Mod yes was used in the
competitive scene basically turned
called ed into more of a counter-strike
style game and as that was a lot of fun
i played with a group of guys they're
all costa rican guys we had a language
barrier and so is basically every every
round is they be on me like Steve follow
that was all i got for instruction SI
the whole session was just observing
what are these guys doing yeah and
because i can't communicate with them
how can i contribute in a way that you
know actually doesn't make me look like
the idiot American I think how could I
actually contribute to this thing yes as
that was kind of an eye-opening thing to
like
how how much can just observing the
battlefield actually teach you that way
your desk absolutely amazing how much it
can I played with a group of guys for
black ops 2 that made me look like a
child and because of the sound gosh all
right so and yo you hear me Reverend
like on these if we continue to do these
special shoes you hit me reference black
ops 2 again personally one of my
favorites at least in the context of
multiplayer i play with a group of guys
that I played with consistently on the
PlayStation 3 and we came across a map
called Yemen which was gold because
after the dlc came out nobody ever
wanted to play that Matt could that was
a sharp shooters dream when we get to
that map and I hear one of the guys go
hey we're going to try something I was
like what are we gonna do he said we've
never held a team under 10 points now if
you know these games they go to 75 the
team deathmatch games go to 75 and so
we've never held a team under 10 and I
was like and my first thought was you
held a team to 10 my god that's
absolutely insane it was my first lesson
in line of sight or map coverage because
it actually taught me how like if a
person goes one direction you don't need
to go in the same direction they do
because they're literally whether they
die or not whether they're going to dare
not there their line of sight is
literally covering the entire site
reddit section of the map but each one
of these team members and I believe we
were on a team of six so each one of
these team members was covering a
specific point that mat facing in a
different direction so when I looked at
Yemen from the top down after this game
was over I realized that roughly eight
percent of this map visually was covered
the only spot the only spot that wasn't
covered obviously was the area in which
they the other team spawned to wreck ray
um long story short I screwed up because
the team figured out that we have the
entire map covered I asked for
permission to go out this is like
72 29 seconds yeah seconds left it's 72
29 at this point and I asked for mrs. I
hey can I go out and find him they go
yes don't die I died we beat him 75 to
10 but that was my first lesson in in
map coverage is absolutely incredible
again your gameplay will change
completely based on who you're playing
with what you're doing all that stuff
well that's a when you were talking
about learning that it doesn't matter if
they die or not they're kind of covering
that area yeah that's something I
learned with counter-strike as well as
when you've got a guy covering a or
whatever and you're over at be that guy
dies it doesn't necessarily mean it's
time to just abandon your post yes run
over there absolutely because it may be
the case that there is a kind of one-off
Rainer or either way your dude was
sitting there he had a good line of
sight on everything like let them
communicate what he saw before you just
rotate yeah and that's something that
it's funny how all these things that
you're saying when i was playing these
counter strike source for kind of shake
1.64 condition 0 yeah 10 or 15 years ago
these things that don't occur to me yes
yes that's it's learning how to are
getting better at the process of getting
better at games yeah it's funny man um
and it can be you can look at it from
the perspective of this brain
development like most of us have been
gaming since since we were we were
kidding or even though gamers that are
that are order than us they even gave it
some say it says they were kids but it's
important to remember that our brains
are in a completely different place now
than they were when we were 12 13 14
when we were when we had a lot more time
right yeah one of the things that
Stephen Stephen I talked about was this
this weird place of my enthusiasm for
games has not gone down but the time
that I have to do has gone down compared
right when you get to a Friday but your
ability to get better as gone on yes
exactly your brain can literally handle
more things than it did five six seven
years ago all right it's been it's been
interesting to kind of
to grow up in video game I know it has
been it's been odd little things like if
I again we talked about earlier if
somebody goes left do I really need to
go left and put four eyes on this area
and sacrifice like the fact that we
don't know what's going on over here or
do we split off right things at a 13
year old is not gonna think about it let
me just get in there let me just get in
there yeah yeah there's like competitive
fainty I think specifically to that
point yeah I I think I probably used to
compete a little more with my own team
and necessary you know you're really
sometimes you don't really care if
you're winning or you just assume that
has a high product of you doing well
your team will yes like I just want to
be at the top of my scoreboard yes I
don't care what their scoreboard look
totally different outlook and I remember
what that was yeah I remember what those
so no it was it I think shooters changed
from me big time again as I realized my
breaking handle more things but and I
talked earlier about setting aside your
pride and wonder I that we talked about
a little while back was if I can just be
the especially for me as a sniper if I
can just be the guy to make the team
think twice about going mid then I have
done my part because the rest of the
team can do their thing like it right
and if you know and especially in
fast-paced games like team deathmatch um
causing somebody think twice in the
first person shooter is significant
that's like thinking twice about
anything that could in any game i can
cause you some kind of harm it's now you
suddenly hesitated yep it's time yeah so
that's when your your teammates on my
right at the left or whatever chance to
strike him yeah I love it it's it's
something it again you go back you think
about it and I was you go to sporting
events especially when you're at out of
high school and use like man I wish I
could known this like I was my brain
could have been this one up with stupid
middle schoolers early in high school
but now it's fun it's fun to be able to
get better no matter what it is if it's
College EV is battlefront battlefield
it's fun to be able to go man I can do
these things right yeah i think that's
that's probably for me even
most addictive part about any kind of
games or biking or whatever it is I'm
actively trying to do is is the process
of you can see the progression of
getting better and there's always at
least that for me with games there's
always a ceiling like you don't get
pretty darn good yeah but you're not
going to be as good as the dude who's
got either way more time and more
experienced yes or is a prodigy Korean
bonds rose to whatever yes like is
there's a ceiling but I'm not playing
professionally so no I really care yeah
and there's and there's a again you talk
about sealing I think that's a legit
that's a legit thing you know when I get
on a play to win it's like pay right
it's you no pickup basketball pickup
soccer pick up call of duty last as this
just this is how it is that's how I am
um but there's always going to be a part
of me that looks like that one point 0 1
KD and Saigon we'll work on that today
let's go about 1.2 yeah that's the
struggle especially early on in the game
have not having a game for a while you
got a 1.5 and you're like yes I've had a
great string of games and then you can
spend another hour and bring it all the
way back down to one which is why
tonight which is what happened to me
easily so i didn't get depends on who
you're playing with depends on what
their goals are fun stuff yeah that's a
whole other topic to is fatigue over oh
yeah i like is my first game back with
counter-strike I'll take months off and
go back and dominate three or four to
one like you know man why'd I ever stop
playing this exactly oh my goodness an
hour later you're like I remember why I
stopped playing yeah oh it's funny man I
work I work with kids and you have to
watch your language around them all the
time and call it duty we just thought of
them is me and and some eighth grade
guys we're just talking about what games
call this the curse out loud and I
and not necessary blogs what call duty
multiplayer was that one for me because
I am so competitive yeah the counter
strikes always been it for me CSS
especially uh-huh you meet some very
colorfully language oh yeah using people
and fanta fanta entertaining
entertaining definitely entertaining
which is the point of it all so that's I
think that's pretty good opener for the
first time in his things if you guys
like it you guys are girls found this
content interesting leave a comment
below the patreon link virtual video to
support the site and mostly just I think
for this kind of video just contributing
the discussion yeah absolutely will help
us go with more ideas so thanks for
watching we'll see you all next time
