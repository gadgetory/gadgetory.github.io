it's not using the MCU GPUs as many of
you know at this point and video and AMD
have both moved away from this idea of
em suffix two GPUs for notebooks and
that's shown here this is a pretty
insane one the whole point of this video
is just to talk about how it works
primarily and I'll get to this in a
moment that the unit has two of these
power brakes too and they both plug into
a single adapter which you can see here
so brick one brick to plug into an
adapter and then that plugs into the
laptop so I'm going to talk about why
it's done that way as opposed to a
single brick but as for what this thing
is this is a cyber power Fame book for
extreme it's got two gtx 1080s in it and
it has an intel caseback cpu we
previously talked about the cpu and
overclocked it even but today we're
focusing on the GPU part of the laptop
which is the fact that it's got two of
them the main thing here first of all
this is sort of like the titan msi
notebooks that you've seen in the past
it has a mechanical keyboard I think it
has red switches might have found though
but it's got a mechanical keyboard with
brown or red switches there's a very
small battery I'm going to try and lift
this up and show you and that battery is
up here in the corner so this is
actually really small for what the thing
that is this big black bar right here is
the back plate for the keyboard so
that's the back plate on the other side
as you'll see in RB role as a keyboard
with the switches they are again
mechanical so it is bigger and that adds
to the sort of fatness of the notebook
will call it but this battery small and
the reason it's small is because why
would you have a big one when there are
effectively there's 700 watts of
components in front of me in GPUs cpu
ram all this stuff it even supports two
nvme SSDs there are three total em two
slots want to SATA to our nvm e &amp;amp; 2 1080
s or 210 70s if you get the cheaper sku
but this unit is thirty eight hundred
dollars so when you've got all that
stuff
having a bigger battery just doesn't
matter because you're really not running
this thing off battery life ever the
only purpose of this battery is to keep
the thing alive if you unplug it and
move it from one location to another
it's not meant to be gamed on you
probably won't even sustain we're
processing but that's not the point of
the laptop it is a desktop replacement
and from a technology standpoint whether
it's practical or not it is interesting
to talk about that's because this
splitter is accepting to power inputs
from to AC drops which are these these
are power bricks these particular ones
are 330 watts each so you've got
cumulatively 660 wats here in power
bricks in front of me but 3 30 watts
each individually and then those connect
here if you have the unit that's got 210
70s instead of 210 80s which this has
then these would actually be 2 30 watts
100 watts last per brick with the 210
70s set up but still two bricks so in
speaking with cyberpower the reasoning
here is that it's basically a standards
and ratings type of thin standard safety
standards ratings where once the
company's exceed a 330 watt power drop
as i'm calling it for the unit it starts
entering a class of industrial
components and that has different
certifications different safety ratings
different costs to build so it just
becomes really not feasible for the
manufacturers to do where they can
create a single 600 plus will hot brick
I think about it that's that's an entire
power supply for your average DIY
desktop that is a lot of power so they
split it into two and then pretty simply
spit it into this adapter here which
almost looks like an XLR pinout but not
quite but it takes to there and then
outputs one which plugs into the laptop
so it's kind of cool interesting stuff
to know practical maybe not but
definitely interesting just speaking to
the laptop obviously haven't had time to
test this we are in Southern California
now shooting this so I don't have my
labs out to run
journal test but I can look at it and
tell you about what's going on just from
a technology standpoint for cooling
there's a set of three primary fans
there's one on either side the CPU is
here in the center and that's pretty
easy to tell from a few main things one
it's got the spring tension two screws
holding down the socket cover and the
cold plate to the CPU and I'll just hold
this up a little bit I can't disconnect
this panel unfortunately there we go so
CP is right there GPU number one is
right here and GPU number two is here
and the other way to tell that is
because you can actually see the PCIe
slot here and here and this pcie slot if
you are not familiar with laptops is
because these are MXM boards for the
GPUs so this isn't like a soldered to
motherboard design like his the case
with older laptops when they were less
demanding of bandwidth less complex less
power-hungry or whatever may be the case
with each different generation these rmx
on boards so they plug into a PCIe slot
theoretically you could actually replace
one of something on Ron with just the
GPU and not the rest of the system but
losing just the GP in this case would be
very expensive because they're 1080s so
that's the setup to ram slots in the
bottom if you happen to have one of
these units the the phain book for
extreme or the MSI equivalent emphasized
the OEM then you would basically unscrew
all these obvious screws in the panel
and there's a couple hidden ones too and
those hidden ones are on the other side
so if we flip this over which I'm not
going to do there are two rubber bumpers
that sit between the top of the chassis
where the keyboard is and the screen
when it closes you peel those off
there's two more screws in there so
that's the secret to take this apart and
then there's also roll out a shot and
grab this this part the sort of wings
that go and cover the hinge
for the screen the display and the body
that's how it goes together that's how
the cooling kind of works at a top level
guess I didn't talk about this third fan
this fan is for the CPU it pushes or
pulls I'm not sure which without really
testing it but through this panel here
and then home certainly pulls and then
these fans on the sides are kind of like
blower fans in just in the way they look
but they're not actually they're still
axial fans so that is the fan book for
extreme and it's the two gtx 980 unit
