testing results for Intel's i9 7900 X
now being followed up with the same task
for the i9 79 80 X II and I 970 960 X
we'll be looking at thermal performance
of the 16 core and 18 core Intel CPUs
power performance and some production
workloads in our initial review of the
i9 79 60 X and 79 80 X II this includes
comparative data for Andes at thread
Ripper 1950 X 1920 X and other Intel
comparative chips like these 7900 X that
came out recently before getting to that
this video is brought to you by synergy
the software that lets you share a
keyboard and mouse between multiple
systems if you have limited desk space
and multiple computers to command
synergy removes the need for separate
peripherals or a KVM and works as over
the network software use our link below
to get 50% off the home or provision
with SSL so we're still travelling from
the Linus thing but the goal of today's
review is going to be focusing on the
deleting and thermal testing that we did
prior to leaving we did the most of that
so we have the most data there that
included some power testing and then
with those tests came validation and
blender Cinebench premier firestrike a
couple of other applications some
productions some synthetic so we really
digging through all those numbers today
in the review of these CPUs and the
prices of the seven-line ATX e and 70
960 X are a bit higher than the Saudi
900 x7 900 X is $1,000 part the 79 and
80 X e is about 2000 and the 79 60 X is
about 1700 then you have things like
thread upper down at around a thousand
as well for the 1950 X and a bit lower
for the 1920 X so if you're not caught
up to speed on the deal it in liquid
metal benchmarks and thermal interface
benchmarks that we did recently check
that video and content as well that will
inform you on all the background for
this and then if you want testing
information how we did the deal id's
what liquid metal we used all that type
of thing then check the link
in the description below for the article
where we've got all the testing laid out
and the process for the previous content
piece which was the 7900 acts so let's
dive straight into it we're looking at
these 16 core and 18 core parts today
starting with D lighting and thermal
tests we can look at prime95 28.5 power
torturing at 3.6 gigahertz and 1.15 VI D
fixed the voltage ID is a bit higher
than what Otto would output but it will
ensure that all CPUs tested will remain
stable at that specified voltage and
means that voltage remains fixed Otto
voltage causes fluctuations that would
invalidate results but of course they
tend to be more optimized for
out-of-the-box performance just this is
what we don't want right now is
fluctuations and optimization we want
fixed performance for the Tim and for
the liquid metal to better determine how
the impact from the thermal interface
plays out as we've already covered the
1700 X results in a standalone content
piece we'll focus on the 79 60 X and
Saturday 980 x e today the 79 60 X and
its stock configuration with Tim and
additional silicon adhesive and at 93
degrees Celsius with liquid temperature
an area and a set X maximums pack of 60
C this is the most concerning and from
the standpoint of getting Intel to act
on its poor thermal solution is the most
powerful OMS and sis like Dell Alienware
high power and cyber power rely on ASA
TAC and other companies for affordable
CLC solutions for workstations and HDD t
platforms the facts that we're nearing
the 60 C maximum operating liquid
temperature on an open-air bench means
that under heavier working conditions
and with 240 to 280 milliliters CLC's
we'd be nearly at or breaching the 60
Celsius threshold when in a case this
may result in some behind-the-scenes
politicking between Intel and OEM
partners in the future and is the most
likely path to getting some kind of
change in the thermal interface
replacing the Tim with liquid metal
drives us down to 78 degrees Celsius
with the kraken X 62 liquid temperatures
and now at 45.5 Celsius that's a
reduction of about 13 to 14 C
for this particularly power intensive
test starting on ATX e plots at 90
Celsius with its stock configuration
with the liquid metal variants brought
down to 72 to 73 this reduction is
particularly massive measuring in at
about 17 degrees Celsius drop in average
CPU core thermals by switching to a
better thermal solution on the package
here's the secret with this test though
the 79 to 80 XE did not finish the test
concluded abruptly when two cores hit
the t.j.maxx value of 104 to 105 degrees
Celsius which we can illustrate with a
versus time plot for the temperature and
so we had a shutdown or a crash event
that prohibited the test from completing
to the same duration as all the others
using blender Next and overclocking the
CPUs wheel and the 79 60 X at 4.6
gigahertz with a 1.2 to voltage ID and
are forced to use a 360 millimeter there
I'll take flow radiator with 3 Corsair
magnetic levitation fans in order to
prevent throttling with the 360
millimeter radiator and a 60 DBA worth
of maglev fan Arsenal the 79 60 X with
Tim operates at around 85 degrees
Celsius liquid metal and the 280
millimeter radius as much worse fans
mind you even manages to outperform the
Tim and 360 millimetre radiator on the
stock CPU this alone is enough reason
for Intel to consider better
alternatives a quieter smaller cooler is
achieving better thermals when using
superior interface material even though
it has worse fans using the 360
millimetre Thermaltake flow radiator and
Corsair fans with a liquid metal
application we're now at 76 to 77
degrees Celsius a reduction of about 9
degrees from the Tim and 360 millimetre
solution 79 80 X Eve meanwhile operates
at around 87 to 88 Celsius when using
Tim with a liquid metal version at 75
see a reduction of around 12 to 13
degrees Celsius power blends well with
thermals so we'll look at those next
unless otherwise noted all of our power
tests thus far and into the next section
are taken at the rails we clamp the EPS
12-volt cables to get those numbers
directly
and for our standardized blender test
we're measuring power consumption of 218
watts with the I 979 60 x16 core 32
thread CPU at stock settings or 492
watts when overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz
with a 1.2 2 voltage ID that's 40 amps
down the EPS 12-volt cables at that
point we measured about 214 watts for
the stock 79-80 x ii with in our usual
variants of the 70 960 X and also
measured nearly 500 watts with the 4.5
gigahertz overclock now of course how
worthwhile this trade-off is depends
heavily on the actual performance
improvement and we'll get to that next
comparatively the AMD thread urbanizing
50 X CPU consumes about 144 watts in the
same test we saw the 1920 X plot around
the same with a 145 watt throughput
overclocked in the 1950 X landed at 274
watts though we only ever achieved a 4.0
gigahertz overclock in our initial
testing so it wasn't really worthwhile
let's look at Blender performance
results our 4k animation scene renders
in 15 minutes on the AMD 1950 x threader
for 16 core CPU in 22 minutes on our
stock 7900 X or 18 when overclocked and
in 14 minutes on the 79 60 X let's focus
on the 14-minute 79 60 X time and
15-minute 1950 X time for now the 1950 X
requires 144 watts of power during this
render with the 79 60 X requiring 218
watts that's an increase of about 74
watts or around a 50% increase in power
for about a 5.9 percent decrease and
render time required which was a good
thing you want that decrease although
some studios might reasonably argue that
the speed benefit outstrips power
requirement for those particular studios
as animators can get more done we see
this as increasingly difficult to argue
when requiring 50% more power for gains
in these single digits overclocking the
79 60 X gets it to 11 point one minute
but we're how at around 490
lots of power consumption at this point
so that's a render time reduction of 22%
versus the stocks under 960 X which is
absolutely impressive and worthy of high
praise just looking at how much Headroom
exists in these CPUs but it's 23% time
reduction at the cost of 125 percent
more power so the preys sort of
evaporates at this point sadly this is
very much a your mileage may vary area
lower voltages can better stabilize
these high frequencies with lower power
consumption but that comes down to chip
quality and we just couldn't achieve
anything better than what we were
getting here anyway at eleven point one
minutes the seven nine sixty X is twenty
seven and a half percent faster than the
1950 X but draws three hundred and forty
eight watts more power to do it the 79
80 X II meanwhile completes the render
in thirteen point three minutes stock or
ten point one minutes when overclocked
and these speeds make the 79 60 X far
more desirable than the 79 80 X II in
this task given its price point and
relatively equivalent blended
performance again though we must
consider the 1950 x4 folks not GPU
accelerating the renders or for anyone
who has specific scenes that render
better with CPUs the 1950 X here offers
a better balance of power consumption
and thermals in exchange for it's still
fast render times they're not faster and
they're not the fastest but they're fast
and if you want the fastest and you just
don't care about anything else including
the cost of the CPU and the power
consumption which is factored into cost
at some point well it looks like you've
got a new fastest CPU to consider for
interesting it's just not as balanced a
victory by Intel but it is a victory we
have to give credit for tremendous
overclocking Headroom but also must take
some away by pointing out that the
architecture scaling and efficiency is
showing as the clocks increase and as
the voltage increases Cinebench power
consumption looks like this during the
multi-threaded test the 79 60 X consumes
about 249 watt stock and about 486 to
490 Watts overclock the 79 ATX
e consumes around 230 watt stock for
this particular test or around 444 watts
overclocked
and this with a lower voltage so it
consumes less power if you're wandering
throughout Ripert meanwhile consumes 151
watt stock for the 1950 ex core 4 core
that places the 79 60 X at 64 percent
more power than the 1950 X when both are
stock and as for how that translates to
performance here's a chart the AMD
threader per 1950s stock CPU achieves a
score of 30 170 CB marks multi-threaded
and 165 single threaded the I 979 60 X
stock CPU achieves marginally better
multi-threaded scores of 31 90 points
but has a significant single-threaded
lead at 194 points this isn't a surprise
at this point this is what we've been
seeing with Intel and AMD over the last
well a long time now for all intents and
purposes though the 7-9 60 X is
functionally equivalent in
multi-threaded performance to the 1950 X
with a less than 1 percent performance
lead in this particular benchmark this
sub 1 percent gain is at the cost of an
additional 100 watts down the EPS
12-volt rails though to be fair in
blender we saw a greater gains than were
seen in Cinebench but the power
consumption was still very high and
there's blender tests so not everything
has changed overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz
the 79 60 X boosted score over stock by
25% 25% again that's impressive
insignificant Headroom for a gain out of
an overclock that's achievable by an end
user in exchange though its power
consumption is increased by about an
additional 240 watts so this 25 percent
performance lead is equivalent to the
gain over the 1950 X as it scores
similarly as the stalks of 960 X thus
every 980 X II hits 33 88 points
multi-threaded leading these stocks
every 960 X by 6.2 percent not hugely
worthwhile for the extra money for most
users but again for those studios where
the only thing that matters is being
done first and fastest or whatever and
freeing up animator time for other
things well maybe it matters but that's
not really our core audience so hard to
say when overclocked to 4.5 gigahertz
the 70 and 80 X mm
forty-three 98 points which is again
impressive but it's also drawing a lot
of power just like we've seen with the
other tests just quickly here's a look
at power consumption during it the
single-threaded workload Intel's lead is
in the range of 17 percent in single
threaded scoring for Cinebench with
power consumption at around 70 watts
stock so a bit more than the 1950 X with
a good bit more performance
single-threaded and that's a game that
intel has had for a while now power
consumption during 3d marks physics
tests look something like this the 1950
X consumes about 100 watts when stock
the 79 60 X stock CPU consumes about 173
watts when stock and the 79 80 XC was
consuming about 144 watch when stock
overclocking pushes our consumption
metrics up to 280 watts with the higher
v ID of the center 960 X or 238 watts
with the slightly lower B ID on the
Saudi 980 X E and slightly lower
frequency in terms of the resulting
scores 3d mark 2 seems to hit a point of
diminishing returns with the 79-80 x e
if you're a benchmark err it seems that
these 79 60 X is the best buy for
hitting the higher combined scores and
3dmark
we're able to hit 35,000 points and fire
strike physics with the 4.6 Hertz
overclock or 28,600 before the overclock
the 1950 X stock CPU hits 25,000 points
at its 100 watt lower power consumption
resulting in a 70 960 X stock physics
score that is about 14% higher fire
strike has a somewhat unique requirement
of high core count and high frequency
both of which are achieved on these 79
60 X but again this is a synthetic
application so the usefulness of this
data depends on what you are doing we
have a lot more power figures than what
we've shown so far but it doesn't make a
lot of sense to show some of them so
prime95 for example we have power
numbers for that that are pretty
reliable normally but we were having an
interesting issue with the asus rampage
extreme 6 board and the 79 60 X or 70
and 80 X II CPUs we're not sure which is
the culprit here but basically with
prime95 28.5 when
overclocked over bolted things like that
the power cycling was extreme to the
point of tripping osep over current
protection so this is with going through
the digit plus PRM and enabling a 240
percent current limit and things like
that but something's Howard was trippin
so with the 79 60 X and suddenly on EDX
e we found that when overclocking and
over bolting them the application would
for awhile show maybe twenty seven to
thirty six or maybe even forty three
amps at the very very high end of it but
always what happened at some point is it
would jump to 50 amps you can do the
math yourself fifty times twelve point
three is what you get for watts so in
some instances of testing we were
getting into the area of 615 watts down
the EPS 12-volt cables to the CPU under
liquid not liquid nitrogen and thermal
and Tim thermal interface material
they're all pasted basically so it would
trip over CP shutdown and the power
numbers are therefore a lot higher in
reality than what they were when
averaged and we're not gonna bother
showing them for that reason but not
sure what the cause of that is it seems
like a prime95 specific issue but we
were hitting in the 40s for amperage
with these CPUs when overclocked and
other applications like blender so it's
it's not only prime it just kind of
depends on how far you overclocked what
voltage you use things like that let's
run through a final benchmark before
concluding with Adobe Premiere we saw
the following rendering performance
metrics we've started finally hitting
performance levels in CPUs where our
premiere ABC HD 1080p 60 P project is it
picking up performance with CUDA but
that's not the focus of our tests and
ever has been we've typically only
included CUDA results to demonstrate
that CPU performance becomes
insignificant as production is
accelerated with GPUs with our
particular test but we're seeing the
1950 X very slightly the 70 90 60 X and
79 80 X e all to a greater
breaking the previous 20-minute barrier
with CUDA starting with the CPU only
performance though because that's what
we actually focus on the 79 60 X at 4.6
gigahertz impressively completes the
render in 33 point 6 minutes for a time
reduction of 22% versus the 79 60 stock
CPU which had a time of 43 minutes Sura
and ATX II is much less exciting
completing its render and effectively
the same time at 79 60 X and this is the
trouble with premiere the software like
firestrike has some unique and weird
requirements that don't always make
sense it wants frequency but it also
wants cores but not too many otherwise
they won't be engaged the 796 DX it
makes far more sense for our single test
project than the 79 to 80 X EDA is
looking at premiere but the 1950 X also
seems to be hitting the same wall at
some point and slightly outperforms the
79 60 X stock so it falls a bit behind
quite a bit behind when we start GPU
accelerated with CUDA in this test but
it's hard to say how valuable that is
outside of our test scenario and as
we've explained in the past the problem
with premiere is it's very project
sensitive so these numbers really apply
to our project it's a 1080p AVC HD
project
I think we're rendering it at 22
megabits per second and it's one of our
youtube videos it was the original EVGA
icx review I think of the 1080 FTW or
something like that but I mean you start
throwing 4k projects at it with
different codecs or you start using
different visual effects or you apply
scales and transforms or warps or things
like that the numbers get crazy and it's
it's just project sensitive and it's
it's very specific to single projects so
you take the numbers for what they're
worth with our benchmark and keep in
mind that if you're not producing
similar videos to what was used for the
benchmark then the numbers don't
necessarily apply now you'd hope that
there's some sort of linear scaling
across the board but that's not always
the case particularly if you start
introducing weird variables like CUDA
and GPU acceleration CPU acceleration
should be more
the same though that's why we focus on
though is not on CUDA so that's gonna
wrap it for now we're still traveling as
you can see but I just wanted to come
out the gate with this review focusing
on thermals power and going through some
of the core production benchmark numbers
the 79 60 X is a much more interesting
CPU to us than the 79 80 X II the
suddenly on ATX e is one of those
flagship Halo type people who want the
best will buy it even though they don't
necessarily need it people who actually
need it well they're kind of out of our
scope so hard to say what kind of
studios or workstation environments
would use that versus like a Xeon or why
would you use that for 79 60 X things
like that maybe if overclocking is not
permitted on those types of business
class systems but the 79 60 X is the
better balance of the two better
balanced financially achieves great
clocks if you can get it there with a
better liquid cooler but the 1950 X is a
major thorn on the side of these now
Intel CPUs here are better gaming
performers we did streaming benchmarks
again they're not really worth showing
because we couldn't really get a good
way to drop frames on these high end
cpus including the 1950 x but the one
thing that's consistent as intel's and
does hold PS a bit higher than AMD but
we're getting into class of cpus where
you shouldn't absolutely not be buying
them for gaming like do not go out and
buy these CPUs for gaming the closest
you get to that is maybe you're someone
like build Zoid and you buy a 79 60 X 4
firestrike benchmarking that's like the
only gaming adjacent scenario where it
makes sense but if you're doing
production tasks seriously consider the
1950 X it's cheaper it consumes a hell
of a lot less power that's really the
big thing here it's it's not cost
because cost you can kind of justify the
extra money if you're a professional and
you look at it like I can complete my
tasks X percent faster that time is
money an extra $700 now is completely
insignificant over the next year
of time that I'm either cutting off from
my employees work or from my own work
but these Intel CPUs the HT DT ones
aren't always faster than 1950 acts at
least not in a significant way they they
tend to be a bit faster but the the
extent of which that speed is realized
in applications in a meaningful way is
limited you might be faster by a couple
percentage points in some cases but the
bigger thing is just how much power it
takes to drive these CPUs to the point
where they are I mean thread Ripper is
just more power efficient that's all
there is to it
Intel's falling behind here and it's
something architectural II some of this
is to do with leakage and thins where
the thermal solution is just not up to
snuff and it's falling behind and
leakage it's falling behind in just the
requirement of the cooler you can get
cheaper coolers with a better thermal
interface on there like we show with
liquid metal or he stick with it stock
he throw 360 on it with some loud-ass
fans he call it a day but that's not
really a great solution to us so we'd
like to see Intel fix that 1950 X is a
serious consideration if you're looking
at via CPUs if you really need that
single threaded performance you can't
get better than Intel right now that's
still the case so consider that as well
the saturnine 60 X is a tremendous
overclocker it's a lot of fun to work
with you can push it really far but you
have to mod it you have to deal with it
get a better material on there get a
good cooler on it then you can get it
places and you need a board like the
rampage 6 extreme as well otherwise
you're not gonna have a vrm that can
drive 600 watts without problems so
power is a big concern here it's the
biggest concern it's a major criticism
against intel's current x-29 CPUs and
with power factors in thermals they go
hand-in-hand in every sense so that
pretty much wraps it up for now for more
information as always a link in the
description below this is a scenario
where
Intel's done some good and some bad but
probably a little bit more bad on this
one than good so it's it's kind of hard
to recommend these CPUs right now but
we'll see we'll see if they do something
for the next round or as we continue to
explore them when we get back to home
base perhaps there are more use cases
where it makes a lot more sense but for
the stuff we're showing today hard to
justify their great CPUs in terms of
performance for raw throughput but once
you start looking at the things attached
to that performance power thermals money
the arguments not so good
so thank you for watching as always you
go to patreon.com/scishow can access to
all that directly it helps a lot you can
go to gamers Nexus squarespace.com or
Store gamers Nexus dotnet to pick up a
shirt like this one we just restocked
all of them and I'll be out of hotels
soon so that's oh one more note for
those of you in the previous video who
are concerned about me being sick or
something no I'm just I'm recording in
the hotel rooms I have to keep it down
so we're all good but yeah I'll see you
all next time
