of the extreme extreme overclocking rigs
today and it's gonna be to tighten our
TX's underwater blocks and we're gonna
put those hooked up to this and this
will have all the fans disconnected we
use this previously so we're gonna
disconnect all those fans and instead
dunk this thing in an ice bucket and we
already have a cooler that we used
previously for that we're gonna hook
that up to a dual DDC pump small
reservoir and put an EVGA xj9 dark on
here with a ninety nine eight exe which
with all of that assistance from chilled
water and this this water block which is
a heat killer block we used in our
previous 99 80 XE overclocking stream
with all of that assistance we should be
able to get it to pretty good clocks one
interesting thing from the previous
stream that I don't know if we noticed
during the stream but I was trying to do
per core overclocking and I have a fun
note on that for for today and how
that's actually gonna end up better than
we thought the biggest thing is gonna be
two of these underwater and then chilled
to see if we can get some new records
before that this video is brought to you
by a thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below so here's the interesting thing
with the 99 80 XE from last time we had
it in this board I don't know if it was
a bug or what but I thought we were
running only a couple of the cores at
5.14 one of the tests and it ended up we
were running all of them at 5.1 so the
per core overclocking was not working
properly might have been a bug in BIOS
not a hundred percent clear on that but
the cool thing is we might actually be
able to run 5.1 stable all core on an 18
core CPU now we've had that rip J
competition going on for a while now J
went to dry ice we didn't do that we
have the tools to do it but never did it
and you know now that we have new
hardware think to really revive this
series what I'm going to do is is see if
we can beat J's score with just chilled
water and if we can't then I guess we'll
move the dry ice or something although
from what he was telling me it's a huge
pain and I would like to avoid it as
long as possible so we're gonna see how
far we can go with just chilling these
things and first thing you need to do is
pick out some water blocks so we have to
tighten our t axes we have the cooler
and I need water blocks
I need the CPU and then I guess we'll do
a shunt mod on Titan RT axis as well the
one concern is that I don't have V bios
mods for these so I don't know since I'm
gonna be limited to 120 percent offset
they might actually be worse performers
than 20 atti which would be
disappointing but I have an idea from
Build Zoid that involves removing one of
the shunt resistors or both no plot now
maybe both remove the shunt resistors
and short the contacts directly rather
than with liquid metal so if this
doesn't work out well then we'll go that
route next I guess and try his shunt
resistor mod but let's start with the
water blocks today and then we'll
explore more after that here's one so we
have a couple pick which ones were using
we have a thermal take one we have an ek
20 so these will fit 20 atti blocks will
fit on the Titan r-tx which is really
nice okay so we have to pick which of
these to use if twenty atti the
reference PCB is the same as the titan
r-tx reference PCB which makes things
really easy I'm thinking everything I
think I might like the heat killer so
keep this in mind damn that's pretty
pretty clear winner
there's ek UK thought they had an issue
right around when the 28th et I was
having all those artifacting defects and
I think it might have just been that was
before everyone kind of figured out it
was Nvidia at fault so I don't know if
ek was ever actually who that is they're
really the MOSFETs are extremely far
away from the waterblock on this so we
could put a thick thermal pad in there
and it would be fine but it needs to be
like a two millimeter thick pad so not
sure if that's the best solution that's
their only thing their own take might be
the one with an issue let's see how
Hosey case clearance on the vram is good
MOSFETs will need a thicker pad
otherwise should be okay that's a
good-looking block this is the heat
killer super nice okay we're gonna start
with the heat killer by water cool all
right
condensation is not too much of a
concern on these as long as there's not
air flow and because this entire system
is gonna be underwater air air is not
going to be hitting any of these parts
so probably what I'll do is mount at all
and then I think just stuffed a paper
towel around the outer edges to prevent
any air from getting in there and as
long as no air is getting in the no
condensation it's gonna form on the
underside of the block so that's my hope
I'm hoping that's enough
probably well yeah there's a full
coverage block so I mean I could I could
do some coating around the GPU but I
mean I might as well do the whole board
at that point and I don't feel like
coating it in Vaseline because I don't
want to clean it off later so we're just
gonna we're just gonna do a paper towel
around the outer edge and
hopefully that's enough to prevent
condensation the dew point is low enough
I mean it's a it is what are we 44
percent humidity right now so we should
be okay anyway so I need a good thermal
paste and I need to figure out which
hunts go where just a multimeter to
figure out the shunt resistor paths it's
a lot of you have seen this plenty of
times at this point but we're doing is
we're doing a resistance check and we're
gonna check against the 12 volt line
coming in and then against the leg of
the shunt resistor and we have the mod
mat on stored at gamer's axis done that
we have some footage of the wiring
diagram on there if you want to buy one
that's what I use to remember where I'm
measuring so this shunt resistor leg
right here
five million shunt resistor measures out
as no resistance to the 12 volt pen on
that PCIe connectors that one goes there
and because the same PCB as the 28 ECI
this one should go there
there it is okay cool that was it
just hard to hold it steady okay so the
one on the back goes to this one okay so
what we're gonna do is just liquid metal
on these for now do the front one first
mount the the water block and then after
that we'll look into builds roid
solution later but the first step is to
get this up and running it's going to be
kind of a pain to disassemble it but
we'll do it this way
I think we're just gonna tape shop towel
to the back of it so no backplate some
mountain without backlit okay so we're
gonna do the thermal pad this is gonna
suck the plastic still has to come off
of these so right now I'm just making
sure I know where everything goes so
these are 0.5 that's gonna be from
memory did it pre-cut them out that's
nice
this goes there and we're missing one
one of the throne pads didn't make it
into the bag or didn't make it or stuck
to one of these other ones there should
be one more up here I can probably cut
this one make it fit though like in
plastic
bastard
and okay got it
okay so the good news about this you
know it is a pretty slow process is that
this is covering most of the parts so in
terms of preventing air flow these
sternal pads would do a pretty good job
of preventing air flow which is good
because they're just supposed to
transfer heat into the block and you
don't want any air getting under under
the block this is physically hurting my
back my necks gonna be all stuck after
it like this
they shorted me a pad bastards all right
good enough guthka nuke so we got all of
the hot pads on liquid metal I guess is
the next step
these are free liquid metal they don't
sell them at a Walgreens with their
Bauer's face on them though I think he
should get into it so like I said
there's a more interesting approach to
this than what we're doing which is
build Zoids mod I have to talk to him
about it I haven't yet where instead of
liquid metal he'd remove the shunt
completely and then solder a little
setup in place to short
two of the pads that the shunt resistor
comes off of so that's a really good
looking approach that 100% removes the
power limit the downside is that
requires physically modding the card and
it also I haven't done it before so I
did talk to him about that maybe if if
we don't get a V bios that will allow us
to overpower this card then I'll
probably go that route you too much it
will bug out the card and you let's
remove it so that might be kind of
bordering on too much we'll see there
your question is as long as it doesn't
drip I wanted to sit vertically then
we're good no nail polish to protect the
parts around it should have done this
first really but I was fairly confident
so okay so that's down in the in between
that and doctor and the shunt resistor I
put a bunch of nail polish because the
inductor has a foot down there and we
don't want that to come into contact
with the shunt resistor via liquid metal
because that was short stuff out so
we're good there biggest concern is
still V bios but we're at a point where
we can put the waterblock on the card
with some thermal paste so I'm gonna
grab some cryo not after that so I'm
gonna put a lot on for two reasons one
doesn't matter and not contacting a part
of the GPU is really bad you can start
killing small parts on it internally to
I want this stuff to squish out and fill
just around the perimeter on the
substrate just I mean it's not going to
hurt anything and it will add additional
layer of ensuring there's no
condensation drip down onto the small
caps and and things on the substrate
okay so what we need to do at this point
is they're being very formal here
referring to me as II I appreciate that
water cool thank you as opposed to the
informal do so leggins edane cooler out
of the four barite at the graphic carta
and Ramsey on fleece and bite us to
Zalman oom a bunch of other stuff so
basically Reina screw the screws in and
we have a whole bag of screws so 15
cylinder head screws there m3 by eights
two cylinder heads I'm three by six and
some washers it's a heavy heavy water
block use some serious copper on this
super dense
that kid from the verge video was right
when he said you needed he said you need
an allen key and everyone made fun of
him because he only needed a Phillips
head screwdriver it was actually right
you didn't need an allen key for this so
we have I think yes we are clear we were
clear of the shunt resistor
get out of there alright okay there's
the washer okay oh my god what a pain in
the ass
there it is it looks really good damn
cool so I got to make sure there's
contact everywhere
and it looks like there is yeah we're
good to go
okay so that's a card number one and now
we need to do
liquid metal on that one I'll do that I
guess I'll do that now before I forget
and then we also need to cover up the
backside with loose shop towel need to
cover up the backside of blue shop towel
just to prevent condensation from
forming okay nice
there's enough surface tension it's
staying on okay cool
okay card number one is finished so we
took took a break or on day 2 now of the
build because day one was really just
through careful picking these up now
they have liquid and hell on them it was
just getting the blocks on the Titan RT
axes and they all say 20 ATT is but
their Titan RT X's and they've got
liquid metal on the shunt on the back
which is kind of a precarious position
for it to be in and liquid metal on the
the one on the front side too so we've
got that handled have to leave these
facedown and then the other one has the
water cool block on it they look pretty
good I don't know we might have some
b-roll shots of them or something but
I'm not really sure which one's gonna
perform the best we're not testing that
today something I'd like to test but all
we really care about right now is cool
as well and what we have to do at this
point is put together the rest of the
system so a motherboard Rams heap you
all that stuff and then the hard part is
going to be figuring out how to route
the tubes in the most effective way
possible while also allowing this giant
radiator over here to run down into the
pocket so I don't 100% know where to
start but I guess we'll start with the
motherboard the CPU and the RAM then
start figuring out tube lengths after
that step one we're gonna go back to
this board this is the EVGA x2 99 dark
and this has served us well really well
don't remember what we used for rip ltte
i I want to say was probably this board
as well but we use this for the later
rip J and the repel TT 2 and as I said
in the first part I don't know if it got
edited out or not at this point but
first part of this video one of the
things I said was the Titan RT axes are
not that much better than the 2080 Ti so
I'm not sure if I'm really gonna be able
to gain any ground against these against
J at this point without dry ice but I
really want to avoid it because it's a
pain and I think it'd be cool to to best
his current score without it by using
newer hardware I need a cpu so we're
gonna go grab a cpu so many of the 99
ATX we use the 79 ad XE originally these
all the s-class CPUs it's wet intel
calls the desktop CP as a s-series
that's what all those are and then what
we need is an ex h EDT cpu we have the
79 80 XE which is done so well that it's
become a bit of a meme in our live
streams then the 99 ATX e which is still
soldered and I'm not gonna deal with it
because it's very risky so where you use
this for the CPU first thing we're gonna
do is I actually take the RAM out and
I'll talk you through what we're doing
here so one of the biggest things that
you're not gonna be used to most likely
is preparing for condensation which is
why I'm unbuilding part of this so we
are going to put some blue shop towel
down around the CPU socket area and
condensations really only get a form
when the the cooling solution is lower
than ambient temperature and there's
airflow over things that can form
condensation like tubes for example and
so we're gonna have the block is a
potential risk the everything around the
socket where the block overhangs part of
the motherboard that's a potential risk
for drip edge from the block and then
the we're just gonna real limit airflow
on the best way to limit air flow is to
eliminate fans and then after that the
next best thing to do is to stuff paper
towels everywhere so I'm going to keep
these fans on the VRM there's probably
not going to need it because since we're
using chilled water for everything
through this setup over here this is all
going to be dunked and ice will have
some condensation forming on the tubes
with these will be wrapped with blue
shop towel as well and because this part
for the CPU will be below ambient it's
also going to sort of naturally cool the
rest of the board around it and that
includes a bit of the vrm because if you
think about everything is connected by
copper traces inside the board copper is
a conductor of heat and it's it's going
to help us sort of
keep everything surrounding the CPU sub
ambien including parts of the VR app
which we've seen with the video cards so
I need shop towel first thing we need is
an anti-static wrist strap that's not
connected to anything you we learned
this from the verge you may have seen
their PC build and actually if you wear
a LIVESTRONG bracelet it's preferable
but this is the best we have so we need
one of those just to make sure we
wirelessly into the cosmos ground
ourselves because that is in fact how it
works I'm going to need a lot of shop
towel and I think what I'm going to do
is put the mounting screws in there and
then kind of just cut around it like an
arts and crafts project or something all
right so what I'm going to do is just
kind of suck at these loosely just so I
don't accidentally cover over the screw
holes and then we'll start cutting
around it this is gonna be easier as I
learned I learned this last time easier
to do it before mounting the block
because otherwise you're like shoving
shop towel and around the corners
and the CPU is socketed so that I mean I
can apply force wherever I want and I'm
not going to bend any pins and we just
need to cut a hole there and what we'll
do is probably do something like this
around the whole perimeter leaving
exposed only the slots where stuff needs
to go something like this should work
pretty nicely and you know while I'm at
it I think I'm going to prepare this for
dry ice as well just in case going with
chilled waters not enough so in order to
do that we're gonna grab some artists
erase or some kneadable eraser and
spread that around too just to give us
two layers of protection here's here's
my bin of X hosi materials I don't have
too many but we're gonna prepare a bit
for dry ice with the ln2 pots
although I'm starting with chilled water
and this stuff is great for that this is
just like favourite castile kneadable
eraser and it is not electrically
conductive it won't hurt the components
won't short them but it will help
prevent air from touching them
dear Bauer and others will use Vaseline
and then he takes the board and and puts
it in a dishwasher
and I would rather not get it that messy
this this stuff is it sucks but it's
easy to remove and it doesn't require a
dishwasher so we're good there this is
from kingpin I bought it from them I
don't think we're gonna use this today
but this is just foam for further
condensation prevention it's kind of
overkill for what we're doing right now
we have like these foam sort of cut out
from ek I don't know oh that's pretty
nice Wow
I was gonna say I don't know if they're
cut to size but these are actually cut
to size where we might want some some
protection is on the back as well I
don't know where they actually intend to
use this I
I haven't used these before so I don't
know if it actually goes here or just on
the back we have socket heaters and
stuff like that to you but we're not
gonna need that today so yeah I need
need a ball eraser on the back and shop
towel everywhere so let's just throw one
of these in there even though I'm not
really a hundred percent positive
that's right belongs and then we'll
throw some of this in there I have this
stuff too
this is more for the backside of the
like these will they fit these oh yeah
they cut some of these to size for GPUs
for us actually so we can put that we
have some allen teapots for the GPUs as
well but let's start with the eraser
it's gonna take a while so it probably
just time-lapse it or something okay
that's the top we're gonna do the back
as well because if any air gets under
the board when it's on the bench it can
definitely form condensation on the back
of the socket for the back of the sock
it's gonna be below ambient and depend
on if we're using dry ice or or just
cold water the severity of the
condensation that can form well will
vary but definitely we're below ambient
here and we've got a big metal plate on
it so I cover that up as well and then
we'll stuff towel around the outside
edges of the board on the bench just to
prevent anything from from any air from
blowing under there
did something rare when I set this up
and was smart sort of hook this up to QD
C's so inhibits flow a bit but I'll be
able to just install the block without
having to worry about the rest of the
tubing length so that'll let me continue
to do the insulation in the meantime
there's one these are all just EK quick
disconnects with the water cool block
and now I just need to get some thrown
paste on there with it Sweeney's thermal
grizzly cryo not a lot of it I'll just
squish out that's fine
so here's the setup put the eraser on
the underside and then shop towels going
roll all around everything that's metal
and also anything that well yeah
everything that's metal anything we
don't want exposed to air and I will do
a bunch of insulation on top of the
block as well because that's gonna get
condensation and you have to be careful
of a few things like like not ripping
off capacitors for example with the
eraser but other than that it's pretty
straightforward
now thermally all this stuff will
actually be fine because even though
it's completely smothered and no air can
get through it all these parts are on
the same PCB ultimately as the chilled
you know CPU and socket so that's going
to if you have liquid nitrogen if you
look at a liquid nitrogen setup you'll
see that it freezes up all around the
area that's actually under the liquid
nitrogen same thing applies here to a
much of last extreme degree anything
that's connected to the chilled water or
the dry ice like cold components will
end up colder just by being connected so
vrm will be fine all those small caps
will be fine they're all going to be
below ambient or at ambient worst-case
scenario so we're good there now I just
need to make sure no air gets anywhere
close to the socket and the most air is
gonna be coming out of here so when it
kind of blocked that off we potentially
even turn those off during a testing if
everything else is cold enough builds
Wade told me how to do it all he made a
video for me of him insulating some
stuff it took him like 15 minutes maybe
20 and and he was like okay done here's
the video of how to do it and just like
an origami
basically he used two pieces of shop
towel and he like folded them in some
weird weird ways like billiards like a
magician with this he had it all done 15
20 minutes
full-coverage and two pieces of shop
towel and like four pieces of tape and
then I did mine and it was like 90% tape
and sent it to him and he was like well
that'll work okay so we're gonna stop
here for day 2 pretty good amount of
progress so far though what we've done
is basically set it up so it's all ready
to go so this is semi modular did the
insulation in a way that when it's time
to go dry ice or something oh I just
pull off the top layer of the the block
and the blue shop towel and then drop on
there Bowers beast onto pot that he sent
us so that's easy to do and I think the
goal here the biggest thing to remember
is that as long as there's no airflow
there's no condensation so don't let air
hit anything around the block and we're
good and this will prevent that from
happening so that should prevent
condensation concerns I think we also
won't need any fans on the bench unlike
last time because last time I didn't
really fully understand just how how
powerful using chilled water is because
as we sort of got it in use we realized
that oh actually having the last time
was a twenty eighty I how many twenty
atti under chilled water gets the vrm
also down to sub ambient by about one or
two degrees so there's no reason to have
here I'm cooling in like the 20s and 30s
Celsius so that's pretty cool and we can
eliminate all the fans on the bench
which means that it helps reduce
concerns of condensation that was the
biggest stress I had last time still a
risk but yeah as we do this more I think
the concern of that risk will go down as
we kind of learn what causes
condensation or where it typically forms
still need to put
shop towel on the back I'm gonna wait
till the very end for that and and wait
till we do the tube routing which will
be the next part so that's that's where
we are now we have two well-built
tighten our TX cards with water blocks
that are full coverage we have the setup
for the motherboard for the CPU socket
with a heat killer for amazing block
last time we did the test we've got the
more a three radiator we're gonna remove
the fans from that dunk it in the 78
quart cooler we have and route all the
tubes so that's the next big step finish
insulation fill it with ice and maybe
some salt and we'll be good to go for
some overclocking live streams with
these and see if we can achieve any new
score it'll be our old score I don't
know if we'll beat Jase current score
excuse dry ice but because they're
tighten our TX's it'll will have a
slight native advantage and fire strike
anti aspire all about gps core so even
if we'd get just like an extra 200
points gps core which is low i think
that will calculate us to be over JS
current standing because most of his
score is cpu point so if we go heavy on
GPU we should be good plus ninety nine
eight exe so it's it's a bit of like
getting a head through arms racing by
upgrading the hardware and j has all
this hardware as well so it's only a
matter of time that were we're forced to
rethink the strategy but that's part one
and two smashed into one video and check
back soon we'll have the tube routing
and the rest of this insane build blog
because that's basically what this is at
this point you're you are you're
watching the building of the most
extreme overclocking rig we've done yet
