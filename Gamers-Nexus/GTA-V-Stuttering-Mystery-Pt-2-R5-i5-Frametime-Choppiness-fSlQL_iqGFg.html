series today not quite sure what it'll
be called yet or how frequent it will be
but i'm joined by patrick lathan senior
editor and he's been helping with all
the rise in passing another testing
where he's hard not test average for the
last week or two issues we've run into
solutions for the issues things like
that before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by the ten
ATSC which has a new MSRP that is it
lowered with the launch of the 1080i
series at 1080 and 1060 SD cards come
with for honor or Ghost Recon wildlands
which you can choose that check out
learn more at the link in the
description below okay so let's start
with closing the GTA 5 story line yeah
so we've talked a little bit about our
issues with GTA 5 in the past I think
one of the largest issues that we had
was visible stuttering with I five CPUs
specifically to high-end modern 7600 k
that's I eyebrows and it was affecting
test results by really skewing the point
one percent lows and yes same times
what's really bad via and we think that
I mean we we discussed this in a video
earlier but we decided that it was
probably an engine issue not an engine
not an issue with our testing but
something that would maybe King gtf up
all of our bench right where I fives at
least in the future so we did a little
more testing with that there were some
helpful comments about viewers that had
done their own testing and had seen
maybe a frame rate cap around 180 7.5 I
always say a rage engine yeah yeah so
that's actually what we saw as well so
yeah yes so basically the story was i
five CPUs looked really bad in GTA 5
when they were fast enough so the faster
the CPU was the worse the frame times
looked which just doesn't make any sense
the 7700 k didn't have this issue so the
7700 k with hyper-threading on never had
a frame time above 16 milliseconds I was
actually just talking to Wendell about
this
my one taxon on Twitter so we never saw
anything over 60 milliseconds you go to
the i5 or you disable hyper-threading on
the i7 and as long as their new ish you
run into the issue where there would be
really hard stuttering to the point that
it kind of would ruin the experience but
you need the height of faster ones
because if it's not fast enough to hit
the 187 or whatever frame cap we weren't
seeing the stuttering and this is we saw
a little bit of this issue with the new
horizon CPUs not as much obviously to
have a much higher core count than rid
of four core i5 but the save wayne smt
yeah so we've continued to have the
issue and we're going to resolve it by
not including the tests that have
erroneous results in them yeah or yeah
and so like that was an interesting
thing we tried back when we did the
original GTA 5 5 testing mystery video
we talked about trying to get the FX
82-73 produce the results by disabling
course but it just it's just not fast
enough yeah we couldn't get it to be
fastened I think even with the lowest
settings so pretty interesting stuff I
think basically the conclusion is
something of the the storyline if you
haven't seen the first video the
conclusion is it's an engine constraint
where the games hitting high really high
FPS like 187 and throttles back
performance in stuttering at that point
on for thread or similar thread count
devices I don't remember I don't recall
if top my head if we saw the stuttering
with cr5 1600 x we did it wasn't nearly
as bad I think we might have seen one or
two yes but yeah that's a sixth Red Sea
fee or not for which tells us that it
may be related to thread count below
eight but yes are interesting stuff
basically the challenge you face the
philosophical question you face is this
game as a benchmark works well until you
get the four threads so as a benchmark
if we're trying to get really high frame
rate so that we're CPU constrained
then it seems fine until you throw an i5
or an smt off our fiber are seven on
there and then it starts stuttering but
the question is you know is that a real
enough use case you know where in GTA 5
will you be playing to a point where
you've got that high of a frame rate and
you're stuttering on an i5 CPU versus
the solution is to just turn up your
graphic settings which is really weird
or I think the solution that we see
offered online a lot if anybody has been
having anything close to this issue the
solution that people immediately offer
is turn vsync on which would REME really
solve that video yeah fixes so yes it
was a workaround if you have this
stuttering problem on a 4th Red CPU then
you can solve it by turning up your
resolution or your advanced graphics
which we didn't do a whole lot with
either one of those as soon as you bring
that PS down below like 165 or 180 or
whatever it is then all the problems go
away that's still a high frame rate so
interesting weird thing I did not
include GTA 5 in the latest r5
benchmarks and I've been slowly phasing
it out for the i5 VP use because it's
just it's it's showing enough issues
where we just need to replace it with
different game me which we've kind of
done with total war and that brings it
to the next us to the next topic which
is seeing the total war warhammer uplift
and that was a one-off lift with rising
TVs initially which we talked about in
the rise and revisit yeah and then
retested it on until later yeah so more
software issues that kind of in the
opposite direction this time there's
been a lot of reporting on risin
improvements in various games but
specifically there's been a lot of
attention on battlefield 1 and 2 war war
hammer and especially the total war war
hammer we've noticed significant
improvements and we have confirmed I
believe we've confirmed that was due to
a an update to the game primarily yeah
the windows update
so there were there are some stories
online about a Windows Update magically
fixing all kinds of the albums with
risin that wasn't really the case and
our testing what actually happened is
the windows update build a 970 coincided
with updates to the games that posted
improvements yeah so if you up get
updated both those things at the same
time it looks like it's the windows
update but in reality was a game update
so total war in battlefield both had
updates about with one to one point oh
eight with the version name or whatever
it was something like they shall not
pass I think some Gandalf name and the
total war added some things and also
with somewhat silently improves
performance to the point where and this
is just recapping the rise and revisit
stuff but very quickly basically if you
disabled smt previously in the old
version of the game now the new version
of the game gets your r 7 r r 5
performance up to the levels of where
smt off was Mia originally yeah so now
disabling smt still gives you
performance up lip but it's a couple
percent whereas before it was like
massive is like 30 frames and really
this is exactly the kind of thing that
we were hoping to see specifically from
total war korean us and we said they
were working on an update working with
AMD to optimize for Eisen and it seems
like they did we did notice improvements
across the board we retested the 2600 k
and a couple of their Intel CPUs ebony
600 k in the 7700 kmo 7500 yeah we're
already tested yeah we noticed
improvements with all those so it seems
like maybe total wars making better use
of a higher thread count see if you just
in general yeah yeah so for our r 5
review the 7770 600 k excuse and the
saudi 500 we're all retested and then
the sub mature that didn't have the
asterisk hadn't been retested that means
there's actually percentage overhead
there we could improve or headroom i
should say so we updated for the review
if there are reviews where they have not
retested intel but have test today and
the after the patch then there's some
headroom there for intel to improve as
well and you can actually look at our
old numbers or is the new
as for the those CPUs and you'll see the
bedroom so that was interesting
battlefield Juan had a very slight
uplifts not nearly as exciting but there
was a flip and then a couple notes I
guess maybe we should talk about some of
the mem testing stuff so we did in the
same rise and revisit and in the archive
reviews for our five we retested
everything so the 1800 x the 79 or 1700
x to some extent were retested and that
included moving to thirty two hundred
megahertz memory thanks to efi updates
that permit the memory speed increase
more easily yeah so 3200 wasn't hard
right you didn't have to do any special
not hard at all we had initially been
having a lot of issues with higher
frequency memory I think everybody was
having issues with a higher frequency
memory on but with the efi updates and
whatever other updates that have just
like Jesse as I have to hate so I
selectively choosing the memory to idea
using samsung be die only yeah no hi
next stuff yeah that so we we had been
using the only approved Benjen memory
yeah beforehand and we'd only gotten up
to the 29 and 33 but we got up to 3,200
no problem that is the last that's the
highest frequency you can set it to
without adjusting the be relocating yeah
yeah on our a cross-border they were
using so AMD sent us a memory kid that
worked out of the box I think the other
thirty two hundred megahertz kids so we
had all worked straight out of the box
so we wanted to see if we could push the
memory a little bit higher we did do
that and at least one of the tests that
we published we got it to 34 in 66 yeah
3456 I think that was at CL 16 I think
so and we did 3200 at a in some of our
original testing we were doing a CL 14
for some stuff and their hands guy
offers for the 3200 kid later on yeah so
yeah we had 3466 with a g.skill trident
ii kit and the
I think that may have been I'd have to
check our own content horizon revisit
talk about whatever the classic lanes he
was and then other than that we had
pushed to 3,600 finally I think me with
the guile kit maybe not what we go okay
they might have energy skill we've done
a lot of testing yeah there was a
realize a test in there the 3600 results
haven't had published yet because they
were like dick quasi stable yeah they
aren't quite stable there was definitely
a performance uplift from 3200 to 3600
not a huge one over 3466 but we were
kind to be able to hit 33 on it it's
just the stability gets really shaky
there so there's a couple interesting
things one it is definitely worth trying
to get the higher speed memory if you
can that's a two-factor thing they're
one price cost quite a bit ddr4 prices
are not great right now oh yeah mn 2
effort so 3200 as we've said effort
really is not bad now but if you want to
go beyond that then there can be quite a
bit of effort involved in memory
training which is basically stepping
through every single frequency leading
up for what do you want you can't go
from 2400 to 3600 and it just works so
like you went through that process the
most yeah I'm not a professional
overclocker I don't do memory
overclocking very much or at all before
they pretty much but I spent a lot of
time adjusting frequency timings
voltages trying to stay pretty
conservative with the voltages I think
we're like 1.45 at the most yeah with
the memory yeah and uh 3466 was a
highest frequency that we ended up
publishing so yeah I wouldn't speak with
confidence about any frequency higher
than that yeah with our setup yeah it is
possible but it's just an effort thing
so we were able to you 3,600 it we'll
have to see if we can get a more stable
with updates allow it to more stable the
referencing build Zoid a whole lot
throughout that whole process so thank
you Bill died for these professional and
overclockers inside we worked with asu's
as well to figure out kind of what
tuning we could do on the crosshair 6 so
you have memory testing a huge benefit
for remember you ever call you in for
risin if you can get it to work and then
you can afford the memory so there's a
bit of a hidden costs there we're
recommending the r5 fairly heavily in
the review of it over comparable high
five chips but it is somewhat contends
that there's there's a bit of a
contingency on memory speed so just make
sure 2933 and beyond you're not in bad
shape 3200 ideally just you know there
may be a bit of a sacrificing capacity
in order to get the better speeds which
if you're not using the capacity beyond
8 gigabytes which probably won't for
gaming it's a worthwhile sacrifice right
now and we still kind of have to test
the the for stick stuff and rise and we
will get on tier sticks so far but yes
that's the memory stuff very quickly I
guess we can mention we have plans to
update the CPU benchmarking methods yeah
so um as mentioned we've been having
some issues with GTA there were issues
with battlefield that I think we've
discussed yeah metro last light is aging
it it's great to have old games I'm
always going to have an old game and our
benchmarks because people ask like why
don't you use new games all we do but we
just keep one or two old hunt them there
so the one or two old ones are in there
because they don't get updated which is
really nice that's a great way to keep
16 or 20 parts on the list so that we
have at least some level of relative
performance over the past so we will
keep something on there that's older
total war is probably stained as we're
still updating yeah they're just like
pork two of a trilogy coming out soon oh
yeah which makes it even more relevant
GTA 5 on it is probably going to get cut
but we'll make some changes I've got
some ideas for synthetic testing
improvements as well there's I don't
know I don't wanna make any promises you
have there a couple of sweets out there
I look really good for testing in areas
we don't currently test and basically CP
tasking will be updating now what that
means the
the critical part here is whenever we
update an entire test suite like we just
did for the GPU stuff all the data goes
away like uh which is very sad
unfortunate so we lose a huge historical
set of data it means that potentially
data going forward is not comparable to
the old stuff we'll do our best to
retain a lot of that total war should be
retain about any other games we keep
should be retained a little bit so we
will still have some historical data
there it's just in the new games like
ashes escalation it's going to be a cold
chart you're going to lose a lot of data
and that's just the nature of it so yes
cpu testings getting an update and we'll
look more into that probably after a
couple more revisit pieces I'm not going
to name the chips yet but we have some
visits in the works those will likely be
the last things tested with the current
cpu bench alongside maybe there are five
1400 or whatever you yeah there are
three tips by the time those come out
and whatever Intel is working on we're
probably gonna have a new set of tests
to run now so that will give us some
time to breathe from risin I last thing
here there's other testing things but
more importantly I want importantly we
have this coming up so i'll let you
intro this I don't know how much you
want me to spoil here which name is good
okay well this is a cooler boss cpu
cooler I don't really want to reveal
much more than that but I can't let me
share the window I'll just share that
this is a window click into it and
neither of us can read eighty percent of
the text on the box and the instructions
manual is not in English I think they're
swimming this tables it there's a little
bit of English so we could probably
leave that the hair keep an eye out for
this one it's uh I mean it's I think it
was a thirty-dollar cooler so you know
it's right up there with the hyper 212
one of the most popular coolers of all
time the thermaltake contact 12 the
silent one that's just come out this is
in the same price bracket and we
discovered it sir
great to see if we can blow the socks
off of the cooler industry in the sub
$35 market let's look at like like what
like a month to delivers about five or
six yeah yeah that should give you
enough insight escameca yeah thanks for
watching if you are interested in this
type of thing basically the idea is at
some interval we're going to get
together and talk about all of the
testing issues challenges and other
updates that we've faced and walk
through some of the behind-the-scenes
stuff basically what this is you're
interested in it let us know thank you
for watching as always subscribe for
more you can go to patreon.com/scishow
help fund the insane amount of hours put
into all this stuff including the
inevitable test bench update which is
very very sad yeah shut it here for data
stored our cameras Nexus dot net for
shirts and we'll see you all next time
you
