expensive HP m2 is but there haven't
been many firm numbers attached to the
perk card cost of Andy's decision to opt
for the on interposer solution and the
standalone MSRP structure for Vega 56
positions it competitively with the gtx
1070 it carries comparable performance
equal memory capacity and similar target
retail price assuming things calm down
for the entire GPU market at some point
given HB M 2's higher cost and Vega 56
is a bigger die that leaves little room
for Andy the profit when compared to the
gddr5 solutions that's what we're
exploring today alongside y and you had
to use HP m2 before getting to that this
video is brought to you by synergy the
software that lets you share a keyboard
and mouse between multiple systems if
you have limited desk space and multiple
computers to command synergy removes the
need for a separate peripherals or a KVM
and works as over the network software
use our link below to get 50% off the
home or pro version with ssl there are a
lot of reasons that Andy went with HP m2
of course it's not just a marketing
thing of this is the new shiny object
that we have you should buy it there are
actual legitimate reasons especially on
the power front and power consumption
with Vega architecture we'll get to
those in a little bit in this video but
just the basics here for folks asking
why Andy can't just make a bag of 56 or
64 with gddr5 you can't just swap
between the two different types of
memory it would require a new memory
controller setup do a lot of things
really a new power delivery system so
it's not quite that easy they're really
stuck with what they've got now and
there are reasons that they went for HP
m2 but it is factually more expensive
than gddr5 so walk through both of those
aspects today let's start with prices
and then talk strategy and these pricing
structure for Vega uniquely leans on
bundle packs to help improve the
company's value argument in a
competitive market MSRP is $400 on rx
bacon 56 500 on rx Bega 64 and then an
added $100 up charge in exchange for two
games and some instant discounts and
these intention with this is to offer
greater value to gamers but clearly this
will also help the company increase
margins we have more rise in parts and
thus recoup some of the potential low or
negative margins on Vega
this is aided particularly with game
bundles where a be partners pay Andy
about $29 for the game codes though that
is often waived or offered in exchange
for MDF and the also stated desire to
save off some mining purchases with the
increased bundle prices as this would
offset the value proposition of the card
to minors
since the bundles are sold as standalone
skews and can't be broken by consumers
ie broken into different pieces it seems
that this is potentially an effective
solution at keeping minors at bay if
that were indeed the intention this
moved to leverage bundle packs which is
somewhat unique to both GP manufacturers
is also mystified by complex economic
surrounding potential long term plays by
Andy with the company having already
somewhat lost a bet on HP m2 pricing
decreasing by the time Vega rolled out
in fact price increased at least once
within the past year and Hynix
ultimately failed to deliver on Andy's
demands in a timely fashion or a an
achievable fashion at that in the
meantime Andy could have its outlook set
on increased supply driving down costs
to build Vega GPUs this might mean
taking a slight loss at the beginning or
running on slim margins for now with the
hopes of a payoff somewhere down the
line part of this hinges on hynek's
potentially coming online with HP on to
at some point which would hypothetically
reduce the cost figures that will go
over in this video but ultimately Andy
also needs to reclaim gaming market
share part of that reclamation process
will be aided by gritting teeth through
painfully slim margins or even losses at
launch and of course there's a reason
that high necks couldn't meet demand for
now part of it is that Andy is really
their only large demand partner in HBM 2
so they didn't have a whole lot to
deliver on other than Andy's contract
there are two major costs with a video
card the ASIC and the memory with follow
up costs comprised of the VR MN to a
lesser extent the cooler the PCB all the
penny a dozen parts let's start with the
HB m 2 and interpose reprising as that's
what we're confident in speaking with
David Cantor of real-world tech the
analyst who broke news on Maxwell's
tile-based rasterization and who
previously worked at microprocessor
report we received the following
estimate from David Cantor quote the HBM
to memory is probably around $150 and
the interposer in packaging should be 25
we later compared this estimate with
early rumors of HB m to pricing from
earlier
year and word from four different
vendors he spoke with gamers Nexus
independently all of which were within
five to ten dollars of each other and
with David Cantor's on record estimate
this gave us high confidence in the
numbers taking his $175 estimate of
combined HP m2 and interpose her figure
we're nearly halfway to the MSRP of Vega
56 with the rest of the cost comprised
of the usual the VRM the GPU dye itself
which we have no idea what that costs
and diamond does and electrical
components it cost a normal person for
instance about forty five dollars to
build the vrm on Vega that included the
two dollar 70 cent per phase cost for
instance of the irf 6890 fours and the
IRF 68:11 low and high side direct FETs
about eight dollars eighty cents for all
six of the IR 3598 drivers and roughly
four dollars on the IR 35 to 17 voltage
controller Andy is a large company
though and would receive volume
discounts even as individuals we could
order 10,000 of these parts and drive
that cause down so we don't know what
they pay for the vrm and we're not sure
how many AMD ordered and aren't going to
speculate on what their discount would
be but those numbers give an idea for
what someone might pay if they weren't a
major corporation this primarily helps
explain why and the opted for the same
PCB and vrm on Vega F II 64 and 56
especially given the BIOS and power log
on 56
although Vega can certainly benefit from
the advanced vrm the necessity of it
lessens as we get down to the lower end
card the increased volume from v 56
orders could offset cost across the
entire product stack to a point of it
being cheaper to over build Vega 56 then
to order two or three completely
different sets of vrm components and
PCBs regardless were about a hundred and
fifty dollars in on the HBM two and
twenty-five dollars on the inner poseur
putting us at around 175 with the cost
of the memory system before the die or
any of the other components we did speak
with numerous folks including cantor on
estimated GPI costs and pricing on that
for Andy and for the AV partners but the
estimates were ranging massively I like
hundreds of dollars of range to the
point where they were really just
educated guesses and without something
more concrete to work with without
corroboration between all the
different estimates on record and off
there's no point in trying to speculate
on them so we do not know the cost of
the GPU dye we're only focusing on the
big thing here which is what everyone
talks about HP m2 is expensive
that's how expensive it is but the next
part is how expensive is gddr5 because
you need a point of comparison there to
make any sense of it
ultimately for GPU cost and yield only
really AMD and global foundry know that
for sure and so then the next question
is what about the gddr5 costs a recent
digitized report pegs gddr5 at about six
dollars fifty cents for an eight gigabit
module though also shows pricing for
August onward at 850 per module with the
old pricing let's run fifty two dollars
cost for an eight gigabyte card or sixty
eight dollars with the new pricing we do
not presently know the g5x cost but the
cost of gddr5 puts HBM to at about three
times the cost for an equivalent amount
without factoring and yields or the
larger GPU die of course so this shows
why and these margins are so thin on
Vega we also know that Andy is passing
along its HP m2 cost to partners at
roughly a one-to-one rate they're not
really up charging on it which is
typically what happens with gddr5 memory
there's no room to up charge the HBM to
with vega's price target though ignoring
GPU cost and cost of less significant
components again like the vrm and cooler
we're at 100 to $130 more than 8
gigabytes of gddr5 cost to build this is
also ignoring other costs like
incalculable R&amp;amp;D or packaging costs
we're just focusing on memory today as
that's what we know at the greatest
accuracy now that we know how much HP m2
and gddr5 cost it's important to talk
about why Andy's using HP m2 they're
spending a hundred plus dollars more for
the same capacity so there's got to be a
reason for it beyond marketing and
beyond what they normally say so Andy
generally puts it this way like most of
AMD's hardware the company is looking at
HP m2 as a long-term investment they're
looking at it as a long play
technologically to try and get some kind
of benefit out of it but the real reason
the most important reason is that HBM to
critically allows Andy to reduce its
power consumption in terms of bandwidth
per watt so to speak because gddr5
really wouldn't enable that with Vega
architecture Vega architecture on its
own draws clearly plenty of power but
without HBM - it'd be a whole lot more
and ultimately this is something we
talked out with Fiji with the fury X is
carrying through through Vega with an
upgrade to the HBM now in iteration two
and it's the same story it's that using
HP m2 allows AMD to lower their power
consumption and what their architecture
that is particularly required it's a
very specific need on a per Architecture
basis we're presently Nvidia can get
away without HB m2 on their consumer
cards but NVIDIA is in a much different
market position they have a much
different architecture and AMD built for
HB m and their GPU Vega is particularly
starved for memory bandwidth without HB
m2 or even with it if you run it at a
lower frequency so there's a clear need
for this memory design on Vega so back
to the power side of the arguments begin
with build Zoid we know that vega
frontier Edition 16 gigabyte HBM 2 pulls
20 watts max using a DMM to determine
this consumption the signor is the
voltage controllers 3.3 volt draw but
we're still at 20 watts on memory and no
more than an additional 10 watts for the
controller so that's less than 30 watch
the entire memory system on Vega
Frontier addition we also know that an R
X 480 uses 40 to 50 watts for its eight
gigabytes of memory which is already a
significant increase in power
consumption per gigabyte over Vega Fe
again Fe the R X 480 also has a memory
bandwidth of 256 gigabytes per second
with 8 gigabytes of gddr5 versus Vega 56
is 484 gigabytes per second the result
is increased bandwidth the same capacity
and lower power consumption but at a
much higher cost to build in order for
an Rx for a to hypothetically reach
similar bandwidth power consumption
would increase significantly build joy
calculates that a hypothetical 384-bit
gddr5 bus on polaris architecture would
push 60 to 75 watts and a 512 bit bus
would do 80 to 100 watts for this reason
alone
HBM 2 saves AMD from a high power budget
that would otherwise be spent
solely on memory this comes down to
architectural decisions made
years ago by Andy at this point which
are most readily solved for with HB m2
as HB m to provides greater bandwidth
per watt than gddr5 HB m is effectively
a necessity to make Vega at least
somewhat power efficient while keeping
the higher memory bandwidth imagine Vega
56 or 64 drawing an additional 80 to 100
watts the world wouldn't have it the
world freaked out as it is at what Vega
draws now and it'd be one of the hottest
cards made since the GTX 480 or the r9
290x the Vega architecture is clearly
starved by memory bandwidth to overclock
an HB m - alone shows this as its gains
are greater than just core overclock
increases and they didn't have another
choice but to go with HB m - this was
forced
even though cost would be roughly 1/3 on
the other type of memory gddr5 it just
didn't make sense to use it
gddr5 might be possible but not without
blowing power consumption through the
roof or losing performance by limited
bandwidth the alternative is just a
lower performing card and they provided
GN with a statement pertaining the
choices revolving around HB m - which
reads as follows am the chose a CH BM to
memory for Vega because this advanced
memory technology has clear benefits on
multiple fronts
Adri m2 is a second generation product
that offers nearly twice the bandwidth
per pen of first generation HB m thanks
to various refinements as we noted in
the vega white paper HB m to offers over
three times the bandwidth per watt
compared to gddr5 each stack of HB m2
has a wide dedicated 1024 bit interface
and side note here there are two stacks
of that allowing the memory devices to
run at relatively low clock speeds while
delivering tremendous bandwidth also
thanks to die stacking and the use of an
interpose err they go with HB m2
achieves a 75% smaller footprint for the
GPU die plus memories versus a
comparable gddr5 solution finally the
combination of high bandwidth excellent
power efficiency and a compact physical
footprint made HBM - a clear choice for
Vega we have no plans to step back to
gddr5 and Andy did end up going for two
stacks of HB m2 rather than four so
compared to Fiji we're at roughly the
same memory bandwidth as the previous
version of HB m just with two stacks
they're actually technically it's a
slight decrease in memory bandwidth but
the architecture is different overall so
not quite that simple either way
Andy says no plans to go back to gddr5
they do benefit from the bandwidth per
watt category for sure and that's
ultimately the crux of this decision
more so than anything else more than any
future looking marketing more than any
of the usual items that you may have
read pertaining to this launch it is
lowering the power consumption for an
equivalent amount of memory with
ultimately a better bandwidth than they
would have gotten with gddr5 that's why
hbm's who is used as for cost knowing
that the memory system gets us up to
nearly $200 as a starting point it's in
arguable that Andy has lower margins on
Vega products than could be had with
gddr5 but the company also didn't have a
choice but to use HP m2 it's not a good
or a bad thing it's just a fact
Nvidia forced Andy's hand here they
dropped the 1080 Ti in March alongside
Rison therefore stealing some of the
thunder from Rison pulling in more sales
because you really didn't have another
option but on video to pair with those
1,800 X CPUs and then they followed that
with a 1070 and 1080 MSRP reduction
that's ignoring the current insane GPU
pricing and just looking at MSRP as
that's ultimately where the two
companies battle under normal conditions
AMD is able to make back some of these
margins with bundle packs where a pair
of games can be sold to a IBS for $29
cents consumers for $100 despite the
games presently at time of shooting
being available for 90 they can also
make back margin where risin and
motherboard parts help recoup some of
the additional spend each motherboard
sold is and other chips that moved and
rise in sales go completely to AMD
either way Andy has to increase its GPU
market share
fighting through early losses or slim
margins as part of that and the
long-term play is clearly hoping that
increased demand and supply will lower
cost a bill so it remains to be seen how
that will play out well there's a bundle
thing certainly helps in the interim so
that gives us a starting point for cost
to helps contextualize what people mean
when they say HP m2 is expensive that's
your number
that's how expensive it is it's about
three times more than gddr5 give or take
$20 depending on the gddr5 market right
now and that's pretty rough for Andy's
profitability and these making a lot of
plays here to try and recoup some of
they're doing the bundle packs for one
and they're selling cards that are
basically well they've got a couple
different spins on the same PCB and BRM
that helps a lot too because ordering
more volume of those parts means you
don't have to one order a special small
quantity for Vega frontier edition and
then a different quantity for Vega 64
and then a completely different board
for Vega 56 so you save money there
that's one of the other plays this one
as a specific benefit to consumers means
that if you buy bacon 56 you do actually
get a really good vrm so that's a nice
benefit but it is also to help them
reduce cost additionally the company
really couldn't have reasonably gotten
gddr5 to work on Vega without major
drawbacks based on what we know of the
architecture based on you check the
power consumption yourself of the memory
at less than 30 watts for 16 gigabytes
of HBM - you can't compete with that
with gddr5 not with big it's to memory
starved they'd have to go with a smaller
bus they do so at a higher power
consumption and it just wouldn't be a
good look it wouldn't be a good product
that could compete now it would be
cheaper to make so you might end up with
another Polaris where it's just kind of
another mid-range product rather than
targeting some high-end so Andy really
was in a tough spot they were forced to
do this HP m2 is not used because Andy
is trying to be the good guy and further
the market here and push technology it's
being used out of necessity it would be
nice if everyone started using HP MT
because I mean ultimately it is
objective fact that it's just more
efficient in terms of performance or
bandwidth per watt than gddr5 g5x is a
different story I'm not talking about
that don't know enough about its cost or
anything like that
HBM - certainly would benefit a 1070 for
example but the difference is and video
and AMD have different needs and Vidya
doesn't need HBM - to get the
performance it gets its architecture is
different and frankly speaking in terms
of market Nvidia doesn't feel the same
pressure that AMD does Andy is pressured
into making decisions that are more
costly for them or more risky but that's
what you have to do when you try
to compete where you're 30% to 70% or
whatever it is these days so that's
where it stands there's there's your
pricing anyone who is curious there's
why they used it and as far as
performance we're doing more work with
Vega 56 hybrid the mod that we live
streamed recently overclocked it quite
high with the extra 100 percent power
offset 400 watts through the card but
did something like more than 17 hundred
Hertz so that'll be fun content check
