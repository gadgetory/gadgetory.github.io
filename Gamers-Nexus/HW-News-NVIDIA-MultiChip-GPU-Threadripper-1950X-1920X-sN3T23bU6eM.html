news recap for the last week we're
looking at the week of July 3rd for this
one including some last-minute news that
made it in on Rison thread ripper and
the are three cpus none of those are
finally officially announced with
specifications and prices so we've got
that more a lot of news from the NAND
side of the industry and and and DRAM
shortages and process changes and then a
couple of other small items to get
through because we're taking a break
from Vega for one day here before
getting to those that this coverage is
brought to you by EVGA and their 1080p
is c2 which we've recommended fairly
highly for its build quality and the icx
sensors which are kind of fun to play
with you can check our full sc2 review
for the 1080i if you're curious to learn
more or you can click the link in the
description below to find the product
page for the 1080i sc2 starting with
thread Ripper and the new rising CPUs so
first of all the finalized official name
is risin thread Ripper not just thread
Ripper so it is rice and thread Ripper
and that means that the threader for CBS
will bear some of the same branding like
r9 for instance but the main chips that
were announced today were the 1920 X and
then the 1950 X and those respectively
are $800 $1,000 the 1920 X threader for
CPU is a 12 core 24 thread CPU and then
the 1950 X at $1,000 is a 16 core 32
thread CPU the 1950 X has a base clock
of 3.4 gigahertz it will boost up to 4.0
and then the 1920 X is 3.5 and boosts to
4.0 as well so these are a bit slower
than the high-end r7s that exist in
terms of the base clock but overall they
it's completely familiar architecture
it's familiar clocks for the most part
which is actually a bit higher than what
some of the earlier rumors suggested so
that's good to see
and these TPS also support quad channel
ddr4 that's kind of new official
information the PCIe LAN count has
already been known for a while at 60
with four go into the chipset so you
might hear 64 when talking about the
lane count on these CPUs and then
finally the big thing here is it's
likely still August 10th for the release
date that's what we heard from a board
partner back during Computex and AMD
base we confirmed early August so that
seems to align with that then this one
was less sensational but still import
important the renouncement of the
horizon 3 the our 3 CPUs they're looking
at 4 core 4 thread processors available
July 27th so that's new as well new
information and those should be
analogous to Intel's
i 5s and I 3's but we'll see we don't
have full pricing yet it should be a bit
cheaper obviously than the r5 1400
though Samson announced last week that
it successfully bought its newest fad in
pay on take South Korea online for
v-nand production multi-billion dollar
fab was initially intended to serve as a
dram manufacturing facility but given
the global flash shortage samsung has
scaled the facility for non production
at least for the time being Samsung's
new facility will be the largest and
most expensive fab in the world
especially once the facility reaches
full production capacity also in the
NAND and dram world micron had a bit of
an issue last week so a report by Trend
Force indicated that micron was
suspending its operations on its fab 2
facility because of a malfunction that
allegedly according to trend force
regarded a nitrogen leak so a gas leak
and following that claim of the nitrogen
gas dispensing system malfunction micron
came out and said that they had an event
they said that it was not a nitrogen
week either way the temporary shutdown
only serves to further hinder the DRAM
and NAND supply right now an
availability of things that's them from
DRAM and then which is really most
everything at this point
so suspension will slow things down a
bit it looks like it'll be about 5.5
percent of a slow down according to
trend force in production and that could
be enough to exacerbate some of the
memory
it is right now but Apple's iPhone
really puts the biggest dent in all of
it because they're going to take so much
supply just to make the next iPhone 8 SK
Hynix is beginning at mass production of
its recently announced 72 layer NAND the
noon and offers 4 billion cells improved
circuit design 2 times faster internal
operation speed and 20% NAND to
controller speed increases SK Hynix
plans to ramp up 3 Dean and production
at its m12 and m14 facilities both in
South Korea which will allow them to
begin shipping more 3d NAND than planar
NAND by the end of the year so this is
part of the switchover in process that
we've been talking about last week on
the show we talked about the new Toshiba
qlc NAND or quad level cell brand-new
following PLC and beam and of course and
that was interesting because it looked
like from what the online reports and
speculation suggested it was going to be
a 100 to 150 PE cycles pretty limited
100 programming rate cycles is not a lot
which means that you've got lower
endurance and on other NAND and would
follow the trend of for example PLC be
much lower but following the initial
reports and announcements on Toshiba's
new ql scene and the company came out
and said that they're touting a 1,000
programming race cycle instead of 100 to
150 quite a difference there and that's
enough to start rivaling PLC net so if
that's the case it will be potentially
good for cost per gigabyte going forward
if we're still unclear on this we're
still really not we we lack the clarity
right now like any official testing it's
all just press releases at this point so
there's a lot more to learn about TLC
going forward but in the very least
that's a pretty big difference and we
should learn more at MMS next month the
flash memory summit that happens in
August of every year and now on to some
of the miscellaneous news and product
announcements aside from creating
absurdly long product names Thermaltake
has a new high end power supply the show
off this is the thermal take i RGB plus
1250 watts and as the name implies it
offers RGB lighting inside of a fully
modular 80 plus titanium 1250 watt power
supply the lighting is controllable via
thermal takes alter which was just
revamped for Tom
texe 2017 the new PSU is equipped with
Japanese capacitors a 14 centimeter rain
net + fan or 140 millimeters and all
heavy duty protections that you would
expect on a titanium rated power supply
unit though costs $400 EK water blocks
also announced a new product last week
and that's the m2 nvme heatsink these
are interesting so this is a big trend
right now where people keep making em to
heat sinks some of them better than
others but the thin is SSDs are kind of
tricky to cool you really don't want a
cool demand the man's being a bit warmer
is technically better for endurance how
much does it know it's hard to say but
technically it's better for endurance to
be warmer you want the controller to be
cool though so if you're going to design
like the perfect SSD heatsink for an m2
device you'd probably just make
something that you glue on for sake of
an easy explanation straight to the
controller that would be the best way to
do it but it doesn't look very good so
these companies are still making
different heat sinking solutions eks is
a black powder coated heat shield which
is 13 dollars and then they've got a $15
one that's nickel-plated as well the
company claims that 11c reduction
presumably in a controller temperature
primarily and is meant for use on a 20
to 80 form-factor m dot 2 drives
interestingly MSI has also just
announced a new product line and this
time it's brand new for them they've
added their first line of gaming
monitors dubbed the MSI optics looks
like there will be two models initially
the 27-inch optics g27 C and 24-inch
optics G 24 C both models are basically
identical aside from the size and both
displays used Samsung TN pals with an
1800 hour curvature so yes they are
curved following the trend with a 1080p
resolution and 144 Hertz refresh rate
with AMD freesync pricing has not yet
been announced but this follows MSI's
trend of attempting to extend into
really everything they're on a
tremendous growth trend right now the
company over the past few years has done
nothing but grow so that's why you see
them getting into things like mice
expanding their laptops getting into CPU
coolers some things they do much better
than
others but the company is growing and
that shows at the monitor so the reason
to bring that up it's interesting
because right now Asus is kind of the
only other board vendor that's in
basically everything EVGA has been
slowly expanding they do cases para
spies laptops and video cards now with
power supplies being one of their
leading aspects of business they have
motherboards that on the side I guess
but it'd be interesting to see if they
get into monitors as well because that
seems like a major place to make a play
for these video card companies and
finally Nvidia seems rather suddenly
interested in MCM enabled product and
technology in the future meaning multi
die GPUs rather than a single monolithic
die approach it's a similar approach to
what AMD is pushing with Red River and
epic and a white paper published by
Nvidia they show simulations
demonstrating and alleged at forty five
point five percent improvement when
comparing an MCM GPU design versus the
latest and largest implementable
monolithic die GPU there are some other
interesting figures in the white paper
as well we encourage you to take a look
at it there is a publication on research
and video comm if you're interested in
that one but this looks to be like what
ambi certainly has interested in Nvidia
is now looking into it as well where the
companies are segmenting the monolithic
die approach into multiple dies that are
connected by some sort of interface or
infinity fabric is AMD calls theirs so
that may be the future for avoiding the
stagnation of Moore's law but there's a
lot more to learn about it still that's
