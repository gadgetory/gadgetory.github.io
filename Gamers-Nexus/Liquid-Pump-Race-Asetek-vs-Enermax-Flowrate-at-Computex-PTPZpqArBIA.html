at Computex 2018 now and what we're
doing here is starting a race to race
between an enter max pump one that we've
reviewed several times actually this is
an ef-1 pump the same as what it was
using a thread ripper coolers that we
reviewed ages ago but they performed
exceptionally well actually and the
other pump is I don't think they're
officially saying it but it's pretty
identifiable it's an ace attack
closed-loop liquid cooler pump so two
things here that we'll be talking about
one is just impedance with cold plates
the other is the pump power how fast it
fills me to where the reservoir as we
see here before that this video is
brought to you by the cable mod vehicle
GPU adapter a universal kit that lets
you add a vertical GPU mount to almost
any enclosure the vertical GPU adapter
positions video cards further back from
the glass than most stock vertical GPU
mounts aiding in thermals and also
easily sockets into the PCIe expansions
lots of compatible cases even after kit
is brand new and makes it easy to show
off video cards even in cases that don't
include a stock vertical GPU map
learn more at the link in the
description below so enter max has had
this ef-1 pump for a while they're just
showing it off in a more tangible
fashion in terms of how quickly it can
fill a loop one thing here is speed for
a pump can matter sometimes it doesn't
it depends on what you're talking about
because ultimately the speed of the pump
and speed of filling something will
depend on how fast the impeller moves
how strong the impeller is and then also
what kind of impedance does the liquid
flow face when you're pushing it through
the tubes through the cold plate because
if you have a really dense cold plate
with dense micro fins it's possible that
of course you end up facing enough
impedance that it's less effective at
cooling than if you had say fewer micro
fins so this is something we've talked
about in the past it's something we'll
be talking about more as a couple more
products at the show are left leaving
MDA so this one the EF one pumps always
done pretty well in our testing just
wanted to show this off because the demo
is actually pretty cool it's just a
hands-on demo of how quickly it fills a
loop it did perform better than the AC
tech pumps significantly in our thread
Ripper testing part of that is because
the cold plate is so much larger which
is all something we talked about with
our Noctua coverage larger cold plate on
thread rivers always done pretty well
but relevant partly because thread river
2 is coming out soon
want to show it off other than that the
liquid cooling stuff we'll talk about a
couple of things on the other side of
the booth air cooler liquid cooler this
one here's a prototype so they're trying
to do a white radiator and pump it's a
couple things they can't do right now or
might not be able to do for example the
radiator is still black it's just got
white housing on it so I'd really like
to see the white either extend to the
radiator or change the design so that
it's a black and white design that way
it looks like it's intentional rather
than a limitation of manufacturing so I
guess let them know below what your
thoughts are what your demand is for
white liquid coolers there aren't a lot
of them and obviously it's not
necessarily trivial to make because if
you start powder coating the radiator
then it doesn't necessarily perform as
well so that is potentially limitation
it looks kind of okay though I do like
the white on the top it's just I'd like
to see the fans match the white on the
radiator so that's a potential option to
look tech to prototype right now for the
white version otherwise an existing
cooler and other than that NR max has a
new case a prototype case they have the
case that we saw at CES a few times now
the Sabre ray so that's come out finally
the original Sabre right and they've
also added a saber a advanced which has
RGB LEDs so we have some b-roll of it
it's a prototype right now but it's
basically got two diffusers going down
on the sides of the case and if you're
looking at it going there's glass I
don't like it keep in mind that the
Sabre Ray was one of the cases we'd
really like to see yes specifically
because you could hold the glass out and
swap it with mesh now we haven't
reviewed it thermally yet that's still
to come we'll look at it eventually make
your purchasing decisions analyst we
reviewed it but in terms of having
features that actually make sense being
able to swap glass and mesh panels does
make sense and was something that we
found interesting about the original
Sabre ray so they still have that on the
advance it's just they've added
diffusion with LEDs basically so that's
the end of it it's $20 more I think for
that we put in some feedback for example
I'd like the diffusers to show the LED
less so right now you can see the LED
behind the diffuser pretty well and
hopefully because the prototype that'll
be able to actually diffuse more later
and you won't be able to see the literal
LED as much as just the light so still
prototype all that stuff there's another
case presently has no name but we have
footage of it and it's a smaller case
targeting probably the $80 market so
there's a bit Phenix case here as well
it's basically a direct competitor to
this
they're both prototypes they're both
going for $80 and they're both going for
RGB LEDs the difference is just which
one of them makes the one with better
airflow because otherwise the cases are
direct competitors so it'll be fun to
see who kind of takes the mesh approach
and who takes the solid panel approach
now with the enter max case they were
saying that there's a consideration of
going with mesh for the front or
swappable mesh and glass like these
Sabre a case which would be great if we
saw that that'd be a good move
alternatively pulling out the panel
forward more so that it can breathe more
but it's a prototype as stated so
nothing's finalized yet the $80 price
point though if it comes with the three
fans hasn't ended even two fans would be
fine would be very competitive it's just
a matter of making sure that air can get
through the case so we've provided
feedback but otherwise leave yours below
if you have any thoughts on it and
finally we have a couple of coolers over
here behind the camera but we have
footage of it so there is an air cooler
tower cooler
it's got LEDs coming down the side on
both sides of the air cooler and it just
looks kind of cool the only reason I
wanted to bring it up is because we
don't see a ton of air coolers these
days that are new other than maybe
Noctua and people eventually are gonna
want LEDs on those too so if you really
want it you can get it they have a it's
a new model basically then next to it
there was a liquid cooler that just has
a pump plate the top of it that's got
kind of a cascading design for LEDs just
look kind of neat thought we'd show it
off but we'll get pricing on performance
information later once it comes through
the lab so as always check links in the
description below for more information
subscribe for more and we have a lot
more common tax coverage coming even
though we're about two-thirds the way
through the show now so subscribe for
more as always patreon.com such gamers
axis comes out directly thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
