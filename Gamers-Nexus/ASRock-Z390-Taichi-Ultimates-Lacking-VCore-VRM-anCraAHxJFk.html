hardcore overclocking and today we're
going to be taking a look at the as
Roxas III 90 Taichi ultimate motherboard
so yeah let's get right into it right
starting with the different features
scattered around the board and then
we're gonna of course go over the VR
ends before that this video is brought
to you by thermal grizzly and their
high-end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components Cremona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound learn more
at the link in the description below
so then features features features well
let's start off with the most probably
the most useful troubleshooting feature
there's a postcode down here so that's
really nice to see this basically
displays a - well it's a letter and and
a number code and you can look up in the
manual what those codes mean and that'll
give you some idea of what's wrong so
really useful for troubleshooting under
that we actually find to do two BIOS
chips so the board does have dual BIOS
unfortunately it's not manual dual BIOS
there is no BIOS switch button there's
no BIOS switch switch there's nothing
really to control which BIOS you're on
there isn't there are some LED LEDs to
indicate which BIOS chip you're on but
as far as which BIOS chip gets used
you're basically you basically have a
primary vile sending backup BIOS and the
board will put you on the backup BIOS if
there's enough boot issues so basically
it's a software dual BIOS implementation
I am NOT a fan of these gigabyte has
this kind of dual BIOS implementation on
basically every single motherboard
they've made in the last couple years
and it's just not very reliable it'll
sometimes switch the bot like it'll
sometimes switch which miles chip you're
on at kinda random like for no good
reason I'm not sure if this is true of
the asrock one but generally I prefer
manual control over over which which
BIOS chip I'm on the the reason that
asrock does it the software way and I
assume why gigabyte does it the software
way as well is idiot proofing
because say like there are motherboards
that do allow you to manually control
which which of the two miles chips
you're on and people have a tendency to
break both BIOS chips on those so asrock
is basically saying look we're not gonna
let you choose which mile strip you're
on because you're gonna break the board
so I get why they're doing it I'd still
prefer if you know there was some manual
override for that functionality or they
could have added like a third backup
bios chip you know for for the
especially incompetent users who managed
to break both miles chips on a dual BIOS
board like I still don't get how you do
that like if you brick one chip the
first thing you should do is just like
recover the bricks chip and then you
could start messing around with the
biases again you shouldn't like brick
one and then go and do the same thing
that breaks the first one to the second
one like I don't know but anyway as
Erick has it software wise because they
don't trust people to not do that which
I guess is fair next to that we have a
clear CMOS jumper there is also a clear
CMOS button located up here in the i/o
section and it's really far away from
like well really everything else so you
shouldn't really hit that because I have
heard that apparently some people press
that one like reaching behind four USB
ports or something and it's it's just
like well this is right above the Wi-Fi
antenna so it's not really in the middle
of any of the USB ports so I'd just be
more careful I guess I mean you
shouldn't really we run the risk of
hitting that one and down like he back
down here again we have the reset button
and the power button there's no sort of
advanced overclocking buttons like say
safe boot retry reserved switch off of
well like a cold bug removal switch that
say asus boards sometimes have while all
of these sort of extreme overclocking
boards from asus have that they have a
cold bug removal switch but you don't
have that here though the board does
actually have all of the necessary
voltage controls to do that which is
kind of interesting like a dork is
basically going like okay this board has
to do everything and that's I'm real I'm
a fan of that
I'm really glad that they're just like
yeah we've implemented voltage controls
for absolutely everything and I went
through the like the BIOS manual and
well the motherboard manual and it was
just like they've literally just every
random voltage like these are voltages
that are you know like you'd never need
to adjust even on like lnto and it's
just like yeah you can you can tweak
those too so that's pretty neat anyway
so that covers sort of the buttons and
troubleshooting features the boards have
the board has I'm kind of sad it doesn't
have safe boot I think all motherboards
should really have safe food safe food
is great safe food is like the best bus
and Asus ever came up with so and and I
think more motherboards should really
have it like Osric has it on some of
their boards but here they don't so
that's kind of unfortunate up here worth
noting is the this chip right here which
is the a quanti a 10 gig LAN and this
thing is freaking expensive like this
chip is like almost $50 so this is a
significant chunk of the board's price
tag which really really surprised me
like how expensive this thing is so yeah
that's that's worth noting and then of
course for power of 4 power connectors
we have an 4 pin and an 8 pin we do not
have any extra power for the PCIe slots
which makes sense like some of the other
boards opt to have like a 6 pin or a
molex 4 for extra PCIe slot power but
really on LGA 1151 you don't have enough
PCIe lanes to occupy all the PCIe slots
I mean AMD GPUs won't actually stop you
from doing that like they'll you can run
3-way crossfire on this like I've done
it you can you can run the 3-way
crossfire off of this kind of PCIe slot
situation but this one's running off of
the chips at this one's HX off the CPU
this one's 8 X off the CPU it's just
like it tends to bottleneck the the GPUs
when you do that so it's not really a
practical practical use and so it makes
sense that there's no extra power
connector because two GPUs really
shouldn't be able to overload the 24 pin
and you won't be using more than four
two GPUs anyway so that's
that's that and for the CPU power you
have the eight pin and the four pin and
I've seen a lot of people on the
internet freaking out about the extra
four pin because they don't have PS use
that can with the extra four pin power
connector and you really don't need to
worry about that
your 9900 K unless you're doing like
unless you're deleting and like abusing
your 9900 K in various ways there is no
way you're gonna be able to cool more
power than what this power connector is
able to deliver so you don't need to
worry about that just plug in the a pin
and you'll be fine the four pin is there
if for some like four lnto or various
sub-zero cooling methods people who
stand down there dies you know deleted
with liquid metal and I still don't
think even like deleted with liquid
metal you would be able to max out the
eight pin really that a pin starts
starts being an issue once you start
looking at like ten core and a higher
core count CPUs or well no now x99 was
flying off of a single I panned at least
up until the six 950 X came out because
the six 950 X does like 400 watts plus
pretty easily in terms of CPU power
consumption so yeah but on the 9900 K
you don't need to worry about that being
plugged in and if you don't even have a
99 hundred K you have to worry about
that even less right like if you have
the 9700 K no then let's move on to the
v RM and it's a pretty normal I'm it's
not super massive in fact I think this V
R M is kind of lacking as far as I'm
concerned it's I'm not sure how the
cooling situation is I can kind of get a
glimpse of the heat sinks here and they
are rather substantial heat sinks like
I'll give asrock that these heat sinks
do look like they have some cereal like
they have more surface area than a lot
of the past heat sinks they've put out
on boards but uh the vrm is
unfortunately not say like it's not even
as good as what you'd get on some of the
X for scent like say the X 370
motherboard X 370 Taichi had a better
recurve you're I'm from if my memory is
serving if I'm remembering it correctly
and I think the X 470 tai Chi is also
better on the vrm Department which is
kind of odd to consider
the 9900 Caples significantly more
current than in 2700 X will ever do well
then a 2700 X well so that's worth
keeping in mind
anyway the phase layout is basically the
core vgpu
so that that's what powers your eye GPU
and quite frankly this like for a lot of
people this will not go completely
unused which is kind of unfortunate but
well you know because that could be two
extra phases for v core power which
would be a lot more useful as far as I'm
concerned about apparently some people
like to use the quick sync feature of
Intel integrated GPUs but since I've
never messed with that I don't know how
useful that is but yeah so you do get a
GPI GPU power up there and then here we
get V si si si so system agent power and
VCC IO
so while this all looks like one block
of phases like one big vrm it's actually
four different ones and VCCS AVC cio are
both one phase each v curve is a 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 phase and that is actually
like 10 phase with with doublers so you
have this chip right over here which is
the ir35 to 0 1 the doublers are on the
back of the board which is why you can't
see them in this picture you have the
ir35 to 0 1 for the vrm control and that
is running in five plus two phase mode
which is fine this chip goes up to eight
phases so honestly if asrock kind of
changed the layout of the board and
added a like two more phases right where
VCC sa and vc cio are they could have
gone up to six plus two like that would
have been totally viable but they're
running it in five plus two phase mode
and that v then goes into an ir 3598
which is a dual driver as well as a
doubler built in together and this
actually goes well both of those lines
go into a ir 3598 as well but that that
one is running in dual driver mode so
that then goes to two phases and this
then goes to ten
the ir35 2:01 you know it's a high-end
digital voltage controller from
international rectifier pretty standard
for all recent high-end motherboards
actually I don't think there's been a
single high-end motherboard that used
something other than a 3 5 2 0 1 4 v
core actually no there's the ISL 69 138
that's the that's the only competitor
for this chip the ISL 69 1 3 8 and the 3
5 2 0 1 goes up to a switching frequency
of 2 megahertz which is more than enough
to completely max out the MOSFETs even
if you have doublers so you wouldn't
actually run it all the way at that
switching frequency now the MOSFETs
themselves here are Texas Instruments
CSD ESD 87 350 s and these are dual n
fats so that's why we only have one chip
not to their the high side and the low
side are integrated into these and each
of these is well Texas Instruments rates
these there from Ti so Texas Instruments
rates these as a 40 amp power block that
is not like a actual useful useful
output because if you have 10 of them
like this and you actually tried to push
40 amps through all of them at the same
time you'd be looking at a heat heat
output of around 88 watts so let's let's
talk vrm heat output figures right like
how much heat will the vrm produce for
any given amount of current that you're
gonna push through it so 150 amps this
is around where an 80 700 K or a 90 700
K will max out somebody might be
wondering wait a minute the 90 700 K has
8 cores and no hyper-threading and the
8700 Kaos six cores and does have
hyper-threading how do they pull the
same current well it turns out the hyper
threading increases your power
consumption roughly by the same amount
that it increases your performance and
both of those are about 35 like 30 to 40
percent depending on the scenario so the
9700 K with roughly 30% more core with
33% more cores ends up pulling about as
much power as an 8700 came
style so that's where where those would
fall and also the 8086 k would also fall
in this category so 150 amps for those
and at that current output which this
would be a 500 kilohertz switching
frequency 5 volts gate to sort 5 volts
drive voltage for the MOSFETs which is
their rated voltage like that's what
they're meant to run on there's no
improvement in efficiency from running
them one more so running them like that
with 1.3 volts out you're gonna be
looking at roughly 19 watts of heat
output at 150 amps which I am not a fan
of that is honestly that's like it
doesn't sound like a lot but with
motherboards what tends to happen is the
heat sinks don't tend to be able to
dissipate that much heat though
admittedly the heatsink on this board
like does really like it does overhang
the vrm like all the way down here so
I'm not sure how the cooling system will
deal with it but that is a concerning
number as far as I'm concerned like a
lot of boards where you're looking at
around 20 watts they they very easily it
go well over a hundred degrees Celsius
on the vrm one once you start looking at
that kind of heat output and it's gonna
get worse if you have a 90 so you know
that would be the and it's gonna get
worse if you have a ninety nine hundred
K completely maxed out because then
you're gonna be looking at about 200
amps output and at that point this vrm
is gonna produce about 27 watts of heat
which like again if as rocks did a good
job with the heatsink that's really not
that hard to deal with I'm not sure
about that what the heat sinks like but
this is definitely not the most
efficient vrm out there on Zee 390 it's
also not the worst there's definitely a
lot worse if you if you go you know with
a lot cheaper boards yeah you can
definitely find VRMs where I wouldn't
even put the ninety nine hundred K near
them but the the thing is like this
price tag I think like they should be
aiming more
20 watts rather than 27 which isn't a
huge difference but like a lot of the
other boards are getting you know that
20 watt figure and and some of the old
Trahan boards are getting even less than
that so this is just like I'm not
particularly impressed by that but hey
if Hawks done a good job with the
heatsink they can easily like that they
can deal with that it's just at that
point it's really down to the heat same
because the vrm itself is not the most
efficient thing ever on Z 390 now going
up to 250 amps output at this point
we're going you know so this would be
like practical water-cooled air
Coldwater overclocking and really that
200 amps output you'd be looking at like
dee-lighted with liquid metal maybe a
sanded down die this is really maxing
out a 9900 K you're looking at almost
like that's the kind of current you
would see at around say one point for
each volts right so going past that
we're talking about like extreme
overclocking scenarios so 250 amps we're
gonna be looking at about 39 watts of
heat and that is that's all that that's
honestly really hot and the only good
thing is that you know since this is
probably what you're gonna hit with
extreme overclocking at that point the
motherboard is gonna be probably
freezing over at idle and you're not
going to be running it for extended
periods of use so the vrm won't have
enough time to actually overheat so
it'll be like it'll still be fine but it
won't be like it won't be one of like
I'd keep the heatsinks on this board if
I was running it sub-zero and I've
actually done that for a lot of
motherboards where I'd keep the heatsink
on them but some motherboards you run
them sub-zero and and the heat sinks end
up freezing over and then then you have
a massive puddle and this one I'd be
like well the heat sinks are probably
gonna defrost and actually go above
ambient eventually you know going
further 300 amps and this at this point
I'd like I don't think you can actually
hit that but let's say you did the vrm
would be producing 52 watts of heat if
Intel let's say Intel went insane and
decided to put a 12 core on the LGA 1151
socket uh-huh Sulu 10 nanometer doesn't
work out just keep adding costs so the
mainstream socket anyway the 300 amps 52
Watts yeah that is just not
work this this isn't big enough I the
the heatsink there's no way the heatsink
can deal with that at that point 350
amps because we've still not maxed out
that current rating right because this
is a 10 phase so there are 10 of these
you'd think you'd be able to pass 400 mm
so 350 amps you'd be looking at about 70
watts of heat which is just like at this
point we're like past that 52 Watts
figure we're past practical like
anything in this range at this point
like and you're not going to be able to
cool this 400 amps which is where the VR
I'm absolute like that's the absolute
maximum rating for the actual power for
the actual duel and that's at that point
you're looking at 88 watts of heat
completely impractical so while it is
like it's completely like these are 40
amp rated dual and that's right it's
just not like a practical rating when
you have 10 of them next to each other
if you had one of these chips right and
a massive heatsink dedicated just to
cooling one of these chips then yes you
could pass 40 amps through it and it
wouldn't like burn out or anything but
in an actual real-world scenario where
you have 10 of them next to each other
that doesn't work that 40 amp current
rating really practically speaking
you're probably looking at more like 20
you know 20 amps maybe ish maybe 25
depending really like the the heatsink
could maybe still deal with that well if
you threw enough airflow at it it'll
deal with that that's one of those
things if you crime enough air through a
heatsink you'll eventually be able to
cool pretty much anything at least up
until the point where the metal like the
metal itself making up the heatsink is
the bottleneck but uh yeah so you know
for a 9900 kit like for a 9700 K I'd say
this is perfectly like a good fit I
wouldn't be worried I think the heatsink
should be just fine for that ninety nine
hundred K might be pushing it then again
if you're not like doing things to the
99 hundred K to fix the cooling
situation you're probably not gonna be
able to hit that 200 amp figure anyway
you know if you're at like five
gigahertz with like one point three
volts you're not gonna be hitting that
you'd be like well you'll be looking at
a few amps below that but that would
already
significantly drop your heat output I
mean there's only a 50-amp difference
between these two so if you were pushing
like a hundred and eighty 80 amps you
know you'd be looking at more like
twenty four watts and that's I mean that
doesn't sound like a huge difference but
small differences you know add up so the
heat sink might will obviously have an
easier time dealing with less heat
output there so really like the this vrm
I mean it's a ten phase it's not using
particularly terrible components in any
way way or form but as just not really
big enough I was honestly four Z three
ninety I was expecting I was rakta to
use a to use a freaking like use a
twelve phase right like they've run the
a twelve phase of this MOSFET with this
controller with these doublers on other
motherboards in fact like their X 470
Taichi I'm pretty sure uses this vrm
with just two more phases and that would
have significantly like that would have
you know giving you an extra like that
would have significantly helped the
efficiency if they just added two more
phases but I guess they're like I guess
they decided that they're not going to
bother with the phases and they beefed
up the heatsink because the heatsink
does look a lot better than on like
previous taiichi motherboards but I'm
not sure how that works out in in
practice but the vrm itself it really
just comes down to cooling because
itself it's not that efficient
especially not compared to like some of
the others III ninety motherboards
because I'm already aware that there are
boards that can do that 200 amps output
with that nineteen watt heat output
figure from the 150 amps output for this
one so yeah that is you know I'm just
not impressed especially considering
that a lot of other with a lot of other
motherboards as rocks just bit like
blown the competition away on the vrm
quality and then here it's just like
well it's not bad but it's not exactly
like it's it's pretty borderline between
you know being like bad and good like
it's average there this is what I'd
consider average that's the term I'm
looking for
like it's in between sort of the good
ones and the bad ones because the
components themselves are pretty good
there's just not really enough phases as
far as I'm concerned vgpu fine
like I nobody's gonna push 80 amps
through that anyway so I wouldn't worry
about it actually most people probably
won't have that vrm running if you have
a dedicated GPU plug it in then this vrm
will start like unless you tell the
motherboard to keep the I GPU running
it'll turn off so you don't have to even
worry about that one it probably won't
be running VCC sa and vc cio are both on
are both minor rails so they don't
really push a lot of current so you
don't really need to worry about them
but they're made up of fdpc fdpc 50 30
MOSFETs from Fairchild Semiconductor and
they're controlled by these chips down
here so and this one's system agent this
one's i/o and those are an Peck
APW 87 22s and those are just
single-phase buck converters so no you
know nothing nothing too impressive
right here we regularly see these kinds
of like this which I think exactly this
chip might be on a couple of GPUs for
memory power so it's it's pretty popular
for like single phase applications not
you know nothing special right there it
really doesn't need to be the CCS nvcc
IO never go over you know even like 10
amps output that's pretty much where
they top out and VCC eye is VCC IO is
even lower than SA so you don't need to
worry about those we have a couple of
linear regulators around here and those
are handling all of the extra extreme
overclocking voltages like your well one
that like as walk has a voltage that
they call the cold bug killer which I'm
pretty sure is they're renaming of the
VCC PLL underscore OC voltage so that
would be on one of these regulators then
there's a couple of other PLL voltages
for the CPU DMI voltage that would also
be on the these so there's a whole bunch
of voltages that would be just hanging
off of these little regulators down here
then we have some miniature buck
converters
right around this hyper blk rebranded
o'clock Jen over here so the the clock
Jen's on the z3 90 motherboards they're
added so that you have either more grant
well basically they're added to add more
range to the BC LK overclocking so you
can crank up the BC LK to like
ridiculous levels some boards will go up
to all the way up to like 400 megahertz
or higher even and at that point it's
really not practical but if you're doing
like max memory frequency or max CPU
frequency the the other use is that they
add extra granularity and so you can
increase your core clock or your memory
clock by very very small increments by
using the BC LK so that's why a lot of
zi 390 boards will have clock gens and
it's you know so this is as rocks and we
have some more voltage regulators around
that we don't need the details on those
those are so low-power you don't need to
worry about them then we have VPP down
here again this is one of those minor
rails where it's like it exists you
don't need to worry about it it's not
going to blow up that's for the ddr4
memory chips that's for your ddr4 memory
and then up here in typical asrock
fashion we have a mess like a completely
ridiculous memory of erm so this chip
right here is AUP 1674 I can't get a
datasheet for that but that is a two
phase a voltage controller from UPI
semiconductor and this right here is the
two phases that it's controlling for VDD
R which is completely ridiculous
asrock is like and I think while Asus
also does two phase memory power but as
like as rock goes and uses like full
size dual and fats for their memory
power which is just I don't know why
they do that it's completely overkill I
assume it's to simplify the Bill of
Materials but the thing is well yeah
actually they might have a point with
that they probably well they could have
used one phase instead of two but again
they're only fdpc 50 30s from Fairchild
Semiconductor so that is typical as well
crashing massive overkill memory vrm for
the capacitors all around the
motherboard we're looking at Miche
in chicon FP series 12 FP 12 KS as mark
has them repainted black that's
basically just something that you can
get if you request it it's no big deal
but they are rated for 12,000 hours at
105 degrees and they are used completely
everywhere and in Chi Colin is a
Japanese manufacturer of capacitors so
and I think can we see it nope this
motherboard doesn't do that yeah this
one doesn't do it actually no they might
be doing it because they have like oh no
that's that's different rails I'm seeing
something that isn't there so yeah that
is the Taichi ultimate I mean I'm not
impressed
like I'm not impressed by the the 10
phase they've opted for the heatsink
does look like it should be able to
handle it like I think the the heatsink
you know the the heatsink plays a huge
role here because they are the RM is not
exactly what I would consider the most
efficient of z3 9 tv core VRMs but the
heatsink can make like the heatsink can
make it or break it right because if
you're if you have a terrible vrm and
you stick a big enough heatsink on like
if your VM was producing a hundred watts
of heat right let's just theoretically
say it was producing 100 watts of heat
well if you put a hundred watt heatsink
on it that's not a problem it's not
gonna overheat it's still really
inefficient but it's not gonna overheat
so it really comes down to the to the
cooling system from asrock and from what
I've seen of the heat sinks they look
substantial so I'm just hoping that
Steve tests out the vrm thermals on this
board because the vrm itself is one of
those where this definitely needs a
heatsink there's some others III 90
motherboards where the vrm cool like the
vrm heatsink is just completely
irrelevant because the power stages and
just everything like there's too many
phases and the phases are too good and
it's just like yeah
whoever liked the heatsink is an
unnecessary add-on for the VR I'm
cooling on those but here this needs the
heatsink this definitely means the
heatsink and hopefully the heatsink is
good so
but other than that I guess the
highlight for most people with this
motherboard is gonna be that a quantity
a 10 gig LAN chip because I think this
is probably one of the cheapest boards
to come with it so yeah you know that's
it's kind of that I mean it's it's
pretty average I'm kind of sad that
because in the past as Mark has made
boards where it was just like well
nobody nobody gets even close to what
asrock had and more recently everybody
seems to be catching up and asrock I
feel like then they might be slip like
slipping up but then again I've not
looked at like I never really paid much
attention to the as rocks XIII 70 lineup
or the Z 270 lineup so yeah that is it

to help out
gamers Nexus then you can you know pick
up a mod mat which you can see in the
background of the image from store doc
gamers Nexus da net and what else is
there we also have a patreon page so you
can support us from there and I have a
channel called actually hardcore
overclocking where I do more PCB
breakdowns and other overclocking
related stuff so if you'd like to check
that you know see more of that kind of
content and that would be pretty cool if
you checked out my channel anyway that
is it for the video thank you for
watching and good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
