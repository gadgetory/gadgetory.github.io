some liquid coolers some of these were
dismantled a few years ago for those of
you who've been following since maybe
2012 or 2013 or there abouts but today
we're also gonna be tearing apart one of
the liquid coolers found on the hybrid
cards that we've been building lately
before getting to the teardown this
coverage is brought to you by MSI and a
new msi gtx 1060 gaming X video card
with three pre overclocked settings so
the coolers we have here on the table
I've got the EVGA hybrid cooler that's
on their official hybrid models but that
we've been putting on pretty much every
video card coming out lately
and we'll talk about more about this
design in a moment this one is not open
so I'll be taking that apart on camera
haven't taken one of those apart before
we've also got the H 110 this is a few
years old now this is already torn apart
a few years ago in one of our older
videos the H 110 I believe is a Gen 3
ASA tech cooler and then we've also got
the enttec which haven't said that name
a long time an tech cooler also torn
apart and this one is not a stack this
one's built by Dyna Tron I believe and
instead of having the pump on the the
blah or the pump on the cold plate which
would be here the pumps are actually
located in these in the chambers above
the fans so that's pretty unique and
different we'll talk about that as well
and why they made those decisions so
with liquid coolers we've already done a
video about the manufacturers and
suppliers of liquid coolers and how
there's really not a lot out there it's
basically either your coolers made by a
ASA tech who make this one and this one
and the NZXT x-series coolers or it's
made by cool it's or a cool IT they make
some of course hair as coolers and
they've also been involved legally with
ASA tech and then Dyna Tron's another
option they made these antique ones
there is a swift tech booted out of the
US market with their H to 20 by ASA Tech
but they make coolers as well and
there's also of course cooler master not
it sounds like there's a good amount of
people but there's really not
considering how many
manufacturers there are verses suppliers
coolermaster just as reference made the
fury x cooler that AMD uses and also
made the cpu stock coolers included with
FX 9000 series CPUs and cooler master
also makes the Intel stock heatsink but
that's not liquid cooler so we won't
talk about that so let's talk about this
one first this is the H 110 this is a
few years old it's been torn apart
there's no liquid really left in here
for the most part and you can see it's
it's kind of dried up in some places
because it's been exposed to air sitting
in a box for years but the design here
is very simple this is where the cold
plate used to reside I actually have got
the bottom half of it here there's the
cold plate taped to the bottom half of
the pump block and this is just like a
foam basically to kind of dam that area
and so what happens a liquid comes in
one tube and it goes out the other this
is a I think this is loose yeah there's
a secured by magnet sits in there and
this will spin that's your actual pump
that's creating their propulsion so it's
a little propeller pushes the liquid
around if we were to put these back
together that goes over the pump like
this some somewhere like that and when
it spins it'll pull liquid in when we
look at this from one chamber so you can
see this little chamber here goes under
almost like a tunnel they go tunnels
under this chamber where the pump or the
propeller is located so that's one
chamber that's another chamber between
them you have an in and out effectively
valve setup for the liquid cooler so
that is the corsair h 110 that's built
for CPUs can of course be used pretty
much anywhere but that's a basic idea
we've already taken that apart let's put
that aside this is the antec cooler
which I also took apart years ago at the
same time as that one this one's a
similar design but it's more complex so
first of all this is the
coldplay I've actually taken this cold
plate out it looks pretty much the same
as what you'll find on the other side of
this one but basically these are micro
fins so that's a copper cold plate it's
flat copper on the bottom and then
little copper protrusions on the inside
dozens of them if not more than that but
tons of copper fusions the liquid runs
through these micro fins and so what
happens is your heat gets transferred
from the IIHS to this bottom of the cold
plate the fins will of course heat kind
of disperses across surface area
depending on where heat will travel
where there's where it's cold so it'll
go up into these fins liquid runs
through the fins and the fins mount to
this block here and this one we don't
have a propeller mounted inside of this
sort of CPU block instead the liquid
runs through there's an in and out right
here and an out valves or pass throughs
I should say goes in one out the other
cools it and the sort of warmed liquid
will travel up and go up the tube
eventually arrive at the pump block
which is mass into the fans and this
unique cooler by Dino Tron and Antec and
once it gets here to the to this block
this little thing lives in there like
that so that goes in there and if we
look at it this is similar to a fan this
is almost exactly what you would see if
you open one of your case fans these are
our little magnetic poles so there's
four poles on this and this is secured
by magnet or magnetism right there so
you can see it's pulled down by
magnetism and that's the actual
propeller for the Antec unit so that
spins same thing that pushes liquid
around so it'll pull liquid up here and
push it down there and then once once
it's been pushed down
very simple just like any radiator works
in a car or anywhere else the liquid
kind of this is a tank this contains a
good amount of water the liquid travels
down these little longer tubes right
here it goes down to the other tank and
gets cycled eventually you end up
there's another I believe there's
another pump here that I haven't opened
that one eventually you end up back in
the cold plate area on the CPU block and
these aluminum fins siphon all the heat
off of that tube as the liquid is
traveling data so the idea is as liquid
runs down the sort of metal tubes in
there got Arenas falling out as liquid
travels down those tubes the warm liquid
is being is having its heat conducted
away by all the aluminum fins then these
fans push cold air through the fins and
dissipate the heat out somewhere else
ideally out the case so what you end up
with of course is cooled liquid which
then cycles back through the whole
system so that's the idea that's how a
liquid cooler works and same idea with
this Dyna Tron one as this gen 3 A's
attack as that's newer H Tech one so
let's look at this one now this is the
120 millimeter GPU version of a liquid
cooler as we've discussed in the past
the reason it is a GPU version of a
cooler is because the cold plate has
this protruded copper in the middle of
it so we compare the two you can see a
pretty clear difference obviously this
is a dyno Tron cold plate but same idea
so flat plate built for CPUs are mostly
flat versus this completely flat
protrusion so what's going on here this
is the theory these I don't know if it's
the case for this an Tek one but if you
measure a Sutekh coolers and some of the
other coolers on the market what you'll
see is that the cold plate has a very
slight curvature to it and that's to
better fit and accommodate an IHS
whether it's Andy or Intel so the IHS is
slightly curved and it's also got hot
spots on it a GPU is perfectly flat it's
just silicon there's no
exposed there's no IHS sort of
conducting heat away from the silicon to
wherever it's going so it's just exposed
silicon that's it no IHS so for that
reason a GPU is flat and for that reason
you want a flat cold plate because it'll
be more efficient in conducting the heat
away because this can make better
contact and we've actually tested that
if you look up our 980ti hybrid versus
Seahawk coverage you'll find that so
this thing pretty sure has copper
protrusion it sinks more heat and then
the liquid will cool as normally tubes
are a bit different on the outside but
same idea internally as different types
of tubes we'll talk about that later
maybe so let's let's take this thing
apart I'm gonna start with just pulling
the the cold plate off and this will
leak hot illiquid quick note here if you
think you want to do this on your own
note that your liquid cooler will be
basically useless afterwards so these
are things that for us will get shelved
and never used again because once you've
drained the liquid you really can't get
it back in there it's supposed to be a
closed loop for a reason first of all
the design of these things these are
pump caps they can actually be removed
if you find the right place to pull on
them we've shown that in the past
they're guys so that's a cap you can
actually get a custom one of these made
I'm not sure where you'd do that but you
could certainly have one done that
covers the pump so we've got the copper
coiling going on and the pump itself
with the propeller is gonna be on the
inside but that's the outside so that's
kind of what we're looking up there you
can see in and out or actually there you
go arrows indicate this pretty well so
that's the end so liquid comes in this
tube and it goes out this tube and then
back to the radiator and the tank this
is the sort of bracket to mount to
whatever socket you're working with and
you're going to need a different one of
those for each type of cooler and/or
each type of socket rather GPU CPU or
otherwise
so I'm not sure if if we can separate
that completely from the rest of the
unit or not and put a different bracket
on there but we'll find out
okay so there we go there's the bracket
that could be removed if you had a
different bracket in mind it looks like
you could actually mount one to there
not sure I don't have the crack and
cooler bracket next to me but that may
be compatible much not entirely sure on
that but that you can remove the bracket
so there's that let's go ahead and take
the rest of the pin apart I did I think
I might have felt a little bit of some
leakage out of there but I'm not
positive it doesn't release oh yeah
definitely
okay so there's a bit of liquid coming
out see right there there's a liquid so
in that case I would actually as as we
stated with one of our hybrid built I'd
be very careful that replacing the
bracket so I kind of take some of that
back because yep so uh don't take that
off if you want a different bracket on
there by a different cooler that's the
that's the answer to the heck question I
thought it was gonna be more versatile
than that all right so this is this let
me let me show you this before we take
this apart this is a much newer
generation of ASA tech cooler I am NOT
I'll top my head I'm not positive if
it's a Gen 4 or 5 this is a gen 3 if
this is from the H 110 so I there not
many obvious differences on this side of
the cooler but you can see they're both
vasotec design obviously so let's you've
got this sort of padding here in and out
as previously through one chamber in the
other chamber and then this there's your
little spindle propeller which now
appears to be yellow mounts in there to
one feels like maybe a two pole set up
yeah I mean it is a two pole because you
can even look up here so that's that
let's pull the let's pull the cold plate
off just to look inside of that see how
that looks like
I've gotta have a better screwdriver for
this stuff is not pleasant
come on
thank you
so it was a little difficult to get the
cold plate out hopefully that's all cut
through and you don't have to see the
trip to Louis but we this is just the
number one Philips I just needed a
longer one so we get some leverage so
these are in they're really pretty good
and they're small screws so we got all
of them out with the number one Philips
and then that one got pretty rounded out
so I could not remove that it's also
when they're very tight so you'll notice
it's still in there
I actually just pried this pried it off
with a flathead yeah the hole just I
think it was this one because you can I
don't know if you can see that on camera
but it's huh it's all effed up now so
that's where the screw used to be but
we've exposed the rest of the pump so
here's here's what we've got this one
does not actually have the micro fins I
was expecting that we see on the other
ones well it does but they're they're
much different so what we've got is this
little rubber sort of washer basically
just helps keep it air tight so liquid
doesn't leak out or anything so that
goes on there piece of rubber and once
you take that off you can you might be
able to see very tiny micro fins in
there plenty b-roll on that but I'll
hold it still so very tiny as much
remove the antique ones where they're a
lot farther apart so that's the fins
that help dissipate all the heat when
the liquid passes through it got that
and to be honest I'm not sure what this
little aluminum fitting does on top of
it maybe it just protects them have to
ask a to talk about that but okay so
this is kind of interesting there's a
little channel on either side when we
take that metal off so that shows this
channeling
and we can now see pretty well higher
set of fins higher set of fins and lower
and so the liquid just shoots straight
through that way and that's it and then
this goes C goes like that so that's on
top
here's your in and out areas maybe not
in that order but in and out for sure
and then I'm not sure what these little
plastic things are for I think that's
just a hook into the rubber but I'm not
sure to be honest let's see that goes
like that and then pull it away and
that's what we've got so that is the
inside of a couple of different liquid
coolers the Corsair one you saw that
it's a bit different than the new EVGA
model cold plates pretty cool though
definitely it's definitely a neat piece
of copper the way it's designed there's
those fins I really they're very tiny
let's see if we can show them next to
each other you can see how first of all
the imperfections on this one those were
there since I opened it so that's not a
that's not from our reverse engineering
that's just poor quality control but you
can see it's kind of got the same
channels flanking it like if I hold them
like that maybe it's easier and you can
see that a deck friends are way tinier
that does mean more surface area because
it's more copper right so there's more
copper more surface area you can wick
more heat and the antique ones are
taller though but yeah that's the idea
so those are a couple different liquid
coolers this if I kind of hold this up
here it's now useless one note on this
so liquid coolers first of all it's not
water in there but liquid coolers are
not meant to be sort of completely
airtight I think that's kind of a common
misconception so we talked about in a
couple videos now how the tubes on
liquid cooler should be mounted if it's
a nasal tech pump
way with if you've got a rear-mounted
team should be on the bottom not the top
and the reason for that is so you reduce
pump noise when the the tubes are at the
top there's a good chance that the pump
will suck air through and create some
gurgling noise and that is because
they're not airtight which is by design
because when if you filled it completely
with liquid when it's sort of in the
sock configuration and hook it up to a
system and run the cpu at you know 70 60
Celsius something like that suddenly the
the liquid of course will expand that's
the nature of how these things work so
how heat transfer works so it expands
it'll sort of fill in some of that space
that's why there's the extra air in
there and it's not just filled
completely one of the reasons anyway so
that's all for this one check out more
videos on liquid coolers I need to wash
my hands to stuff is it's not great we
have a pretty cool hybrid series with
our X 480 to 1080 and a 1060 if you want
to see one of these things used in
action check those videos out as always
