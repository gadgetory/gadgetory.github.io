this is Nvidia taking a relatively
successful card the GT 1030 and sticking
ddr4 on it
so rather than gddr5 which basically
every card barring HBM uses these days
they've gone with system memory which is
actually a tremendous downgrade in
memory bandwidth the GT 1030 is named
the GT 1030 and both of its current
iterations the gddr5 version and the
ddr4 version but it's got a few
differences beyond just the memory -
like the clock speed reduction this is
something we've railed against with
other cards in the past and the Istana
and videos Don it they've both done this
but this specific instance is
particularly concerning because what you
have is a device that is heavily
dependent on memory bandwidth getting a
reduction in memory bandwidth from 48
gigabytes per second to something like
16 gigabytes per second with some of the
game performance results showing
differences upwards of 2x so that's what
we will be talking about today
benchmarking the GT 1030 bridges the GT
10:30 with ddr4 it's unfortunate really
because the GT 1030 had more success
than it ever deserved because of the
mining thing going on but despite having
recommended it in the past we struggle
to do so now because it's so easy to
accidentally buy the wrong one and
really get punished as a result of it so
I'm not really sure what we can run for
the ad for this particularly critical
video but I'm sure we'll figure
something out before that this video is
brought to you by us and the gamers
Nexus anti-static mod map the GN
anti-static mana is a four foot by two
foot surface two millimeters thick of
high-quality industrial grade
anti-static material and it includes a
common ground point for Earth a
grounding wrist strap
and it has on its electrical wiring
diagrams that may prove useful a GPU
silhouette and grid for your teardown
efforts and other useful items go to
store like Aaron's exes dotnet to pick
up a GN mod mat today the GD 10:30 with
ddr4 is something we've railed against
in the past and it's because it's one of
the most egregious missteps and product
marketing we've seen really
honestly it deserves to be called
something like GT 1020 or something like
that because this inherently having ddr4
on a card it's not good for performance
but it's something that we could forgive
if it were very clearly marked as its
own product category with any GT 1030
right now the only difference you
legitimately see is if you look closely
enough on new AG or Amazon or whatever
you might see that it says d4 or
something like that instead of g5 most
consumers are gonna have no idea what
that means it's just going to look like
any other randomized product serial
number basically so that's the problem
we have with it the other problem we
have with taking a product changing it
and keeping the same name is that it
makes us look bad in media because
you're going to have consumers
especially the low end who don't know
what they're buying see performance
numbers from us from others for a GT
1030 buy something and get extremely
different performance results and that's
not because of us it's because the
product changed later and the name was
kept the same so you can still buy both
versions of the GT 10:30 you just have
to be very careful about it
graphics devices are actually bound by
memory bandwidth so we go over some of
the basics as to why the differences are
so prevalent here before we get into the
actual performance numbers so if you
want to learn about why they're
different typically speaking anything
that is really dependent on memory
operations going across the bus will be
something like textures a large file
that you're pulling from somewhere to
later recall and apply to an object or a
mesh in the game and these things take
memory bandwidth when you're calculating
memory bandwidth between these two
devices it's roughly 48 wears just 16
gigabytes per second the lower beam ddr4
and that difference is pretty easy to to
come up with so basically you take the
memory bus width divide it by 8 to
convert 2 bytes just for ease and then
after that you multiply it by the memory
clock you multiply it by 2 for DDR or
double data rate and then you multiply
by 2 for gddr5 if it's a thin and the
results again 48 versus roughly 16 and
the difference alone is massive but
NVIDIA has also changed the core clock
of the ddr4 version so the reference
baseline clock for this card the d4
version
is about a hundred megahertz or a little
over below what the original GT 1030
gddr5 card was and that's also something
that's worthy of note but not really a
huge impact at a performance considering
the rest as for what's trains memory
bandwidth it's just about everything in
computer graphics texture sampling is a
big one or anything else that collects
samples for processing anti-aliasing
temporal effects that need to keep
frames in memory scales and transforms
of textures where data it needs to be
retained in memory and so forth the
differences should be exaggerated in
games where shaders are lighter load as
memory bandwidth is likely to be more
utilized anything that relies on heavy
memory occupancy will strain the GPUs
memory bandwidth most of the time that
be higher quality textures anti-aliasing
effects and some fixed function
processing the CPU and geometry
pipelines become more bound by draw
calls and geometric complexity whereas
the GPU becomes more bound by large
files getting calls for application to
objects and meshes or files that might
remain resident in memory for further
transactions and things like transforms
as always getting into the numbers
testing methodology and the test bench
can be found in the article links in the
description below if you want the
written format of it or more information
on how we tested some information here
we used an i7 7700 K which is our old
standardized GPU bench be replaced
eventually and we use that to eliminate
the Seaview bottleneck as even a
possibility we have some numbers with a
G 4560 just to give you a reference
point of where would perform with a more
reasonably priced CPU and then we also
have some apu numbers which of course
use completely different hardware
because it's a different platform so
we've got all that in here some of these
numbers are older like the APU numbers
are from launched they haven't been
retested performance might have improved
a bit but the point isn't to compare
these versus AP use so we didn't rerun
it the point is compare them against
each other and these are the two devices
that were run primarily for this
benchmarking today well start with
rocket League for this one rocket league
is a fairly playable game overall
previously we found rocket League to
operate between 50 and 60 FPS average on
the and the r3 and our five AP use and
we found the GT 1030 and G 45 60 to
operate at around 62 FPS average
removing the CPU bottleneck for safety
we found the GT 1030
r5 GPU and 7700 K we're at 63 FPS
average representing AG view bottleneck
this is what the g5 one again 1% lows
and 0.1% lows were in the 40s the ddr4
version of the GT 1030 stock ran nowhere
close to that frame rate it slumped to
28 FPS average a 55 percent decline in
performance from the gddr5 version of
the GPU or if you do the math the other
way it's about a 2x increase to move to
the g5 version with an overclock
offsetting the core and memory by 250
megahertz each we managed to push 235
FPS average but frame times suffered as
a result the GT 1030 ddr4 card can't
even achieve half of the performance of
the original GT 1030 and they share a
name and that's not right it can't even
operate anywhere close to the level of
an AR 320 200 G stock apu this thin is
getting obliterated by its memory
bandwidth limitations this next chart
shows the frame time performance between
the gddr5 and ddr4 cards 16 milliseconds
would represent a 60 FPS throughput and
we'd ideally see a flat line as that
represent the smoothest frame delivery
or in another ideal scenario the least
amount of variance frames of frame as
possible in frame intervals in this
instance the ddr4 card struggles to
maintain a constant throughput and
chokes regularly on frame to frame
intervals resulting in an overall
stuttery unplayable mess when compared
to its ddr5 alternative that costs about
$10 more dota 2 is next at 1080p the R 3
and R 5 numbers from launch benchmarks
put the APS in the 40s to 50s for frame
rate with the GT 1030 and G 45 60
getting stuck around 63 FPS average
unrestrained by the CPU we measured the
GT 1030 gddr5 performance at 67 FPS
average with lows at 60 and 43 the ddr4
version managed shockingly to carry
almost 50% of the original performance
our GT 1030 ddr4 ran an average frame
rate of 32 compared again to 67 on the
model that costs a couple dollars more
and somehow carries the same name so far
this is just embarrassing csgo is up
next another valve title for this one
the AMD APU is at long
stuck around the 80s to 90s for average
frame rate pre overclocked the GG 10:30
and G 45 60 did well operating at 120
FPS average and originally receiving our
recommendation for an ultra budget csgo
machine at the time unrestrained at the
GD 10:30 with gddr5 managed 120 2.7 FPS
average with a low is relatively
disparate at 85 and 54 fps
the GT 10:30 with ddr4 embarassingly
managed 55 FPS average with a 0.1% lows
at 25 FPS the translation of these low
values is again a stutter II massive
frame throughput will clarify with frame
time plots momentarily 55 FPS versus 123
is a giant reduction in performance from
the original card and overclocking the
ddr4 card helps but not in a way that
can begin to defray the degradation once
overclocked swear at nearly 2000
megahertz core versus the 1800 megahertz
core rough max of the GT 10:30 with
gddr5 and yet performance is still 47%
lower than the original version of the
car here's that frame time plot although
neither card is the pinnacle of fluidity
the ddr4 variants can't keep its frames
consistent enough to provide an
enjoyable experience without graphics
quality or resolution reductions moving
on to ashes of the singularity
no never mind this error popped up when
we tried to benchmark Ash's dx12 with
the built-in benchmark the card can't
even officially run it because it's not
officially supported as a result of its
lack of gddr5 Ash's thinks that this
card is from the G ddr4 era and just
won't even let it run without further
manual modifications to the benchmark so
we'll move on Sniper Elite for at 1080p
high with dx12 and async compute acts
like a synthetic test here realistically
it dropped to medium settings for
playability but we can still use some
stand-in synthetics and that's how we're
treating this one for this one the GT
10:30 with ddr4 again operated out
exactly half the speed of the gddr5 GT
1030
further shaming the poor cards existence
we're treating doom the same way
basically synthetically the reason for
this is because we already have data
racked up for other low-end devices with
these settings
though the settings are way to abuse it
for the 10:30 we can easily compare it
to other devices trouble with doom is
that it's 200 FPS physics tap means that
we have to impose higher settings to
restrict high-end devices because
they'll hit the cap otherwise and appear
artificially worse anyway looking at it
synthetically the GT 10:30 with g5
manages 16 FPS average which is 20%
faster than the GT 10:30 with ddr4 the
gap closes a bit with an overclock and
comparatively this is miles behind the
RX 560 and gtx 1050 which operate at 65
point seven and 44 FPS respectively it's
probably time we start analyzing the
clock differences here and most of our
previous benchmarks he saw the ddr4
version was overclocked and the g5
version was not well it's because we
didn't have to overclock the g5 version
on the ddr4 card overclocked with an
offset of at least 250 megahertz on
memory and on the core the card was
never even close to catching up to its
gddr5 origin this one the first card
even with that overclock so that tells
us this is severely crippled by memory
bandwidth and using fire strike we can
start to show why and how it's crippled
and in what ways it can attempt to catch
up here's an overtime chart for fire
strike we'll add more lines as it goes
the first two lines are the gddr5 and
ddr4 GT 1030 s without modifications
you'll notice that they're fairly close
overall indicating that fire strike
would be a good clock for clock tests
without needing manual modification our
differences never exceed 30 megahertz
which is reasonable it's obvious that a
30 megahertz difference will never
amount to a 50% change in performance so
we can live with this we did another
test pass with the EVGA GTX Core
throttled with a 90 percent power limit
so we can add that line next this one
regularly dips down below the ddr4 card
score clock but as you'll see in a
moment it still outperforms the score
significantly finally this next line
shows the overclock to GT 1030 ddr4 is
core clock which was offset by 275
megahertz for this test it's peaking at
2,000 mega Hertz which is an impressive
gain of nearly 300 megahertz in some
instances even still performance is
behind the gddr5
card and the core can't make up for the
choke created by memory bandwidth
particularly on texture filtering let's
look at the fire strike scores
associated with these numbers the GT
1032 gigabyte ddr4 card is an
embarassment and operates with a
graphics score of 1922 and combined
score of 537 the GT 10:30 with gddr5
also stock managed a 37 93 graphics
score which is a 97% performance
improvement nearly 2x we know that fire
strike is intensive on GPU memory and
this fully solidifies the ddr4 card's
weakness had there been any doubt just
to be sure we reduced the GT 1030 gddr5
cards power allowance to 90% resulting
in a 36 87 graphics score that's still
nearly 2x higher than the ddr4 card
overclock can be ddr4 card by two
seventy-five megahertz offset results in
a 25% increase over the stock ddr4 card
that's not enough to clawback the
tremendous loss versus the gddr5 device
just in case you were wondering here's a
fire strike chart with some other
devices on it and we'll highlight all
the 1030 devices for clarity this is
tested on the same bench and provides an
easy comparison to other devices so to
be clear here this thing the ddr4 card
don't buy this it's garbage it's like a
$10 price difference the GT 1030 as
noted earlier had way more success than
it typically would deserve but we were
ok with recommending the gddr5 version
of the GTS on 30 and actually we would
almost never recommend a card of that
low of a price class because it just
makes so much more sense to step up to
something like a GTX 1050 or maybe an rx
550 or something like that but with the
mining market the way it was and GPUs
and all of that it made sense in some
instances to recommend a GT 1030 so we
gave it the benefit of the doubt it was
actually a decent card for the price for
something like a g40 560 not something
we like to recommend but given the
circumstances a few months ago something
we had the recommend for the price class
now however with a ddr4 version out
there to confuse buyers especially
buyers in the budget market who don't
probably don't even watch us so they're
never gonna see this message
they're not going to know the difference
between the two cards because a lot of
the time the difference is in the name
to the extent of something like GT 1030
whatever OSI Edition lp4 g5 or LP 4d for
those things look like just just a
serial number basically so there's no
reasonable way you can expect the
average consumer to differentiate
between them because it has the same
freaking name otherwise and it performs
way worse so do not buy the ddr4 version
of the GT 1030 and at this point almost
just just to send a message I tape I
don't buy the gddr5 version either
because it's just kind of messed up to
have the same name for two extremely
different products imagine what would
happen if say Intel released an i7 8700
K special edition that's actually it has
two cores and is hyper threaded and
that's it or if AMD released an r7 1700
V - that's an r3 product it's it's an
extreme that it's at that big of a
difference because the memory bandwidth
dictates everything for the performance
of these low-end devices especially so
we take issue with it and would
encourage you not to buy this garbage
product with ddr4 memory but otherwise
if you're curious about the performance
you've got it now and hopefully on video
considers renaming it something like GT
1020 or literally anything else that's
not already used so that's it as always
if you want to support us so that we can
continue buying things that vendors
definitely won't send us you can get a
store documents access net and pick up
