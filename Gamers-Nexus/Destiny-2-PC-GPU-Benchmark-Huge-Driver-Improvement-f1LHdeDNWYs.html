benchmark it was actually pretty
exciting to work with by bridging our
pre-launch
beta benchmarks with identical testing
methods for the launch version of
destiny - including some driver changes
we're able to plot historical
performance between Andy and NVIDIA
hardware and also able to better
pinpoint CPU uplift game code uplift and
GPU driver uplift matching today's data
against our beta optimization guides
we're also able to see what graphic
settings have caused the biggest gains
in performance all the way down to
vendor specific graphics setting
optimizations before we get into that
this content is brought to you by the
Thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop liquid
cooler which is a 360 millimetre
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ring
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a detect
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below there's a lot more
analysis in this game GP benchmark than
normally because we have so much more
data to work with having the beta of
destiny 2 as a baseline to work from and
it gives us a way to plot scalability of
beta versus launch performance in
destiny 2 which includes destiny 2 game
changes and of course the driver game
driver changes for game ready drivers so
that'll be interesting to look at and
give us a better understanding of why
some of the performance uplift happens
the way it does because if you just look
at them one after the other it can be a
little confusing where AMD will lead in
some settings for some benchmarks and
then video will lead in other benchmarks
with different settings so this allows
us to pinpoint that and just to quickly
recap the previous tests we did a lot of
stuff with destiny 2 we had a texture
comparison guide which is still relevant
now with launch we had a game
optimization mini guide at the bottom of
the GPU benchmark that plotted the
performance uplet's from different
settings and basically showed that depth
of field was nuking performance on
everything especially Andy and then we
also had some information on CP
performance so we had a CPU benchmark
which we have just redone for the launch
version as well so you'll find that on
this channel soon as for testing the
difference now largely is
anti-aliasing so we always tested with
fxaa for the most part which made it
really easy to work with and that's
because MSAA is now gone
basically Bungie said that MSAA was
buggy in the beta and with the launch
version they said forget it we're just
gonna remove it from the cam that will
fix the problems so that's gone we're
still using the fxaa here--if which we
use just originally because that was
kind of a suspect move from Bungie and
other than that we'll just go through
the charts and you can get all the data
there as always check the link of the
description below for all the testing
information if you're curious about the
test platform used here and also one
other note although averages are
comparable between the beta and the
launch tests you can't directly compare
the low numbers that we're using because
we used a different tool for
benchmarking because destiny is kind of
a moving target it just blocks a lot of
performance analysis tools and
measurement tools so we had to change
once again which means that the low
numbers are not fully comparable
starting with 1080p highest as that's
going to be the most popular you
configuration for the game this
configuration has us of bumping into the
frame rate wall for the 1080 TI which
encounters the 200 FPS captor in some
parts of the benchmark despite
encountering an artificial cap that 1080
TI leads the 1080 by approximately 20%
that will look toward 1440p it's a
better understand performance with an
uncapped ceiling the GTX 1080 operates a
156 FPS average leading the Vega 64 card
by 7.2 percent and marking substantial
uplift from Vegas previous 122 FPS
average in the beta version and with the
previous and the driver revision that's
a roughly a 19% performance increase
from beta to full launch for Vega 64
braining 64 pass to the 1070 and now
closer to the 1080 Vega 56 runs roughly
tied with a 1070 SC and all walks of
performance including frame time
performance with a 1066 gigabyte and rx
588 gigabyte cards also near one another
in the three reported metrics that we
have here here's a frame time plot of
the Vega 56 and gtx 1070 cards with
these settings just to give a better
understanding of performance as always
we're looking for consistency here and
note of course that lower is better but
more consistent is even better than just
being a lower frame time this next chart
is pretty cool though this is the
scalability versus beta and the line
plot shows average FPS of each GPU
versus the beta average FPS which was
tested with earlier driver and game
versions and video primarily benefits in
the 1080 TI with the 1060 1070 and 1080
posting smaller gains in the range of
three to six percent as you'll learn in
a moment these games are primarily due
to a cv bottleneck loosening and not
necessarily game changes Andy's at Vega
64 and Vega 56 clearly benefited from
either the graphics options changes and
the drivers or both registering 12 to 19
percent performance uplift with these
settings the Polaris 580 also gains
reasonably the difference is enough to
sway NAT Vega 56 tied with the 1070 as
opposed to the previous deficit against
the 1070 at 1440p highest is where the
numbers start to come together he
plotted a similar performance stack but
note that this will switch up once we
get to the high results the 1080i
manages 111 FPS average posting a 33
percent lead over the 1080 FTW with Vega
64 leading the 1080 by 15% this is a
little different from the previous
results and Vega 56 is also functionally
tied with the performance of the 1080
FTW at 1440p highest plotting an 83 FPS
average and keeping low is consistent
those places Vega 56 in a seriously
advantaged position versus the 1080 and
1070 and if you can find it for MSRP it
makes it a better price competitor for
these particular settings but it gets
more complex than that as you'll see in
a moment because it this largely hinges
on what settings are used Vega 56 does
not always have this position but it
does in this test as for scalability
versus the beta here's what we have the
Nvidia cards show almost no scaling here
even less than the previous one
partly because Nvidia already had game
ready drivers at the time of beta launch
so there's really not much ground for
gtx devices to game and video already
put that work in earlier
whereas AMD just now put out their most
ready drivers for the game they get 56
host a gain of a 50.9% an average FPS
for our tests close to an these boasted
42% gains with the driver launch notes
Vegas 64 post 49.5% scaling although
these aren't unprecedented gains from a
driver update and game update the two
compounded together make for a large
leap in the line plot here's where the
data gets interesting if you remember
the 1080p scalability charge the Nvidia
cards there were posting more noticeable
gains than in the 1440p scalability
chart where we saw nearly zero gains and
some of the tests if we bring the 1080p
plot back on the screen you'll see that
the 1080 Ti as noted a moment ago had
the largest gains of all the Nvidia
cards with the gtx 1060 posting nearly
zero uplift that's because of a cpu
uplift and performance with destiny to
which we also have plotted in our
forthcoming destiny to CPU benchmark the
cpu uplift has alleviated some of the
bottlenecking on the 1080 Ti hence the
bigger gains but obviously hasn't helped
at the 1060 level because we were
already limited by the GPU this is an
instance where at 1080p highest the
gains look like they do on the GPU is
not because of GPU uplift but because of
alleviated constraints in the CPU pipe
that's why the two plots are so
different from one another and then of
course and these gains are largely
because of that driver update where the
earlier version of the driver just
wasn't built for destiny properly
reducing settings to high but staying at
1440p we see the gtx 1070 catch back up
to the RX vega 56 leading marginally
with a 1080 leading Vega 64 card by 14%
the 1066 gigabyte and rx 588 gigabyte
cards are within a few FPS of one
another with a 1066 gigabyte leading by
2.7 percent and here's that beta versus
launch scalability charge it now becomes
clear that Andy had the most to gain
when running highest settings between
launch and beta which is something that
we highlighted in our original destiny
to beta research and coverage again the
biggest gains were specifically for AMD
running highest settings with less
concern regarding high during the beta
we route caused this to depth of field
on highest which tanked and the GPU
performance specifically but was
also a big hit to Nvidia you can see
that in our beta graphics optimization
guide from the original launch of the
beta version of the game changing only
depth of field from highest to high
could get us 82% of the way to switching
all options to high this means that you
could leave everything on highest from
the highest preset and change only depth
of field and get 82 percent of the
performance of just dropping all of them
to high that means that something in an
deist drivers or destinies code has
resolved this problem for Andy Hardware
specifically and that's the explanation
for the performance we're seeing our
final few tests are at 4k with the
highest plotting the 1080 Ti about 1 to
2 FPS ahead of the beta at 56.8 FPS
average and that leads the 1080 by 36%
and the Vega 64 by 12% Vega 64 out
matches the 1080 in this instance once
again and that's basically coming down
to the settings in terms of scaling Vega
64 benefits the most moving from 32 fps
to 50 point 6 FPS average with the
launch drivers and launch version of the
game pretty momentous changes for Andy's
Vega cards at 4k high as the previous
tests have informed us this changes
again Vegas 64 is now behind the 1080
with a 1080 leading by 13% the 1070 is
now nearly tied with Vega 56 with Vega
56 slightly ahead this was all conducted
in what is functionally a single-player
part of the game or at least a co-op
version it's the campaign more or less
not PvP but we did do some multiplayer
as a single-player testing in the beta
and found that for the most part they
were fairly comparable in terms of
performance particularly in terms of
performance scaling which is the part
you should care more about than just the
raw FPS number what you're looking at in
these benchmarks is what kind of scaling
do I see from one GPU to the next not
necessarily what hard FPS do I see from
one to the next because obviously that's
going to change depending on where you
benchmark in the game and this game has
a pretty wide range of framerate
depending on where you're testing for
the most part it is fairly consistent
when testing for example the first 5
minutes of the game
in the beta and now with the 1080 TI we
saw at 4k highest settings in the range
of 58 FPS average both times beta and
launch version of the game and that was
consistent throughout that whole period
however every now and then it's not too
often but every now and then there's a
scene that is either exceptionally
high-end performance or sort of low-end
performance not too much of the
exceptional low-end and that means that
depending on where you're testing
obviously it'll change a bit but the
scaling seems to be pretty much linear
between all the devices so that's what
you want to look for the most for
multiplayer and singleplayer testing by
which I mean pvp competitive versus the
rest of the game we did see generally
comparable performance and you can check
the previous beta benchmark for that but
we we're probably not gonna redo all of
those again because the scaling is
pretty much the way it was before with
the driver and game changes counted as
well so it's pretty much the same
performance between different net areas
of the game the scaling you see is from
the updates though and that applies
everywhere globally to the game so
there's some cpu uplift here as we
plotted at 1080p highest and the depth
of field had major GPU uplift what we're
not sure of if is if the other options
in the game between highest and high are
impacting one GPU vendor versus the
other more heavily but depth of field
definitely has had a pretty big change
since the beta because you can plot that
trend and that's why Andy's getting a
lot of the uplift they're getting in
some of the benchmarks particularly the
ones with highest settings because depth
of field has that difference and Vidya
had minor uplift and it's more likely
attributable to game code changes may be
some minor driver tweaks although that
seems there's not a lot of that if there
are any because the original drivers
were pretty much out of roughly a
hundred percent of the performance of
where this is today the exception being
1080p where we were becoming CPU
constrained and that has now uplifted a
bit with the launch version of the game
