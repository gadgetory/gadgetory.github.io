Nexus dotnet and we're doing episode 5
of Saturday heat signature which is our
new series it is five weeks old now that
covers the up-and-coming lesser hyped
games that deserve a lot more attention
so this time we were looking at freight
which is a simultaneous turn-based
strategy game so for those of you that
are sort of fans of the turn-based genre
and are really fans of the strategy
genre but you just can't really stand
the slowness of turn-based games this is
definitely for you for those that
familiar with with frozen synapse is
actually very similar to frozen synapse
in that it is turn-based and they can be
played simultaneously but in fray there
is no II play by email system like in
frozen synapse it must be played all at
the same time and there's no huge
waiting problem because you don't have
unlimited turn durations so you only
have somewhere around 30 to 90 seconds
to do your turn based on the settings of
the game and that makes it much harder
to play much harder to think on your
feet but I'll talk about that in a
second let me talk about some of the art
and so on the story the artistic
direction is very cool it is a super
dark game they will have brighter levels
but as with the cyberpunk and dystopian
genre which is what fray desperately
wants to fit in with and does a very
good job by the way as with that genre
is very dark and it is it does not have
a pleasant outlook on the future of the
of the way things are going so no flying
cities none of that it's just kind of
all in disrepair and falling apart
corporations warring constantly by
pitting their drone like people against
each other who have all been re-educated
in the facilities to make sure that they
of course know which is the true best
corporation and so we are fighting in a
virtual reality terminal defending all
that we have ever been trained to know
by our corporation so this is our job to
get out there and fight the other ones
and that's what we're doing you already
signed a squad of four members there are
six different classes in the game so you
can put four of those on your squad and
every player gets four there can be up
to four players in free-for-all there's
currently planned to be to Team
Deathmatch and there are a couple other
game modes that I don't know a whole lot
of details about I think once called
survival I figure out the other ones
called I know one of them is more of a
capture the flag setting and survival is
probably a stay alive longer setting but
I will get back
those the more important thing to talk
about now though are the the certainties
which art classes and that's what's
really cool about this game it is
extremely tactical it has actually a lot
more options than frozen synapse so if
you played frozen synapse and thought
you know this isn't really strategic
enough for me then Frey is probably more
your speed and it is a lot faster pace
too so that makes it much harder to
think on your feet much harder to make
those clutch decisions and try and
figure out you know should I be moving
my medic over here to heal my assault or
should I be moving him to heal my sniper
who deals much more damage but is much
less likely to survive so those kinds of
situations are in this game a lot and
they make for very tough calls when
you're in those positions that you might
lose one of your units but the biggest
thing to talk about again as I said of
the six classes so we have the tank
which is the guy that takes the most
damage he's very good for luring your
enemy out as you can send um parading
down the center of the street and he
will should be able to take a couple
shots before he goes down he also has a
couple of gadgets that make him very
useful like his guard or I call guardian
shield I forget where I'm pulling that
from but he has a shield that of course
is sort of like the halo bubble shield
except not really a bubble right now he
also has bullet attracting gauntlets I
guess you could call them I don't think
they're completely implemented yet but
I'm not entirely sure and and he has a
couple of other stuff like that that's
basically just made for tanking just
like in an MMO or something like that
there's also assault which is the
backbone of your offensive unit he has a
very cool teleport ability that lets him
get back there get behind the medics and
and the roguelike units and take them
out with his big guns while they are
completely off guard because he just
teleported back there and shot them to
ribbons he also has a grenade launcher
which is extremely effective you've seen
me use it a couple times in this video
at this point I believe if you haven't
yet you will see it again coming up and
the grenade launcher is just it's
perfect for dispersing those clusters of
units which clustering units can be a
very effective strategy in this game but
in order to try and stop players from
doing that and encourage them to use
flanks and and all those kinds of
splitting up and different tactics like
that sneak attacks they the developers
have implemented all kinds
of a of effect attacks and all kinds of
gadgets that will simply do things like
reveal the area and stuff like that and
what we're looking at right now is
actually some motion capture from the
game I know I haven't finished
describing the classes yet this is
actually some motion capture that the
devs did so it kind of I put in here
because it's actually really funny it
shows their personality they are really
funny people they're really confident
too and they are also very into their
game so if you want to play if you want
to get this game pre-order whatever you
can get alpha right now and jump in
there and play with the devs play
against them in their own game and
they'll go easy on you for a little bit
and then they'll just start kicking your
butt left and right but that said let's
get back to classes so we have tanked we
have assault sniper is pretty
self-explanatory extremely high damaging
but very very weak so you can normally
keep one alive by sticking your medic on
them for a little bit just shooting
medic killing bullets at them basically
and and that'll keep me alive for a
little while but not very long so you
want one of theirs assault or tank
heavier units there with them and then
there's also the medic who I just
described and you have the stealth unit
called the shadow and a shadow is able
to go camouflage sneak behind the enemy
lines infiltrate them and basically
assassinate their light armored very
high importance units and medics and
snipers are extremely important if you
know how to use them all units are
extremely important if you know how to
use them just like most well-balanced
strategy games but in this one snipers
are so deadly because they have way
high-powered damage rifles and uh and
you want to take those out with your
shadows if you can sneak back there and
just kind of get in there without anyone
noticing and then just go back into
camouflage and get out drop a radar
jammer if you want on the wakes so
that's some of the cool stuff I think
there's one more class I'm there's a
support class that has a turret sort of
like the engineer in tf2 and he also has
a couple of other things like a
satellite reconnaissance basically a
radar so you can see who's around the
corner see what's coming up and all of
this just comes back to one thing it
makes for a very good strategy game
because all of these units have tons of
gadgets and tons of weapons and you can
unlock even more as you level your units
up now of course that does pose a
question for balance what happens when
the gaming population is predominantly
higher level players and you get new
players that want to join in but are
clearly outmatched well then you have a
problem but i think the developers will
try to address that and i'm running out
of time here because my internet
connection connection is really slow
today so i can't upload a lot on youtube
but it is important to say that this is
currently an Alva so everything you see
is that is definitely subject to change
you can buy the game right now a two for
one for twenty dollars I think it might
be 25 the full price of the game will be
a couple bucks more when it's released
and you'll only get one so this is your
chance to get two copies if you want
your friend to play and there's a ton
more I could say about this game but I
just wrote a two thousand word article
on it so go to gamers Nexus net and
check out that article if you want to
learn a ton more I've separated that out
by images so it is very easy to follow
and if you want to just jump around feel
