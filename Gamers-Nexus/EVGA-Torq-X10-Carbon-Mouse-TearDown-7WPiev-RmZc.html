down or something a bit different if you
have been a fan or subscriber of the
channel or read the website for a couple
years you've seen us do this before I
did this with the g700 from Logitech
some years ago and I believe those 2013
Mouse have not done it since then so
today we're taking apart this one this
is an EVGA Torx mouse or torque I
suppose it's called T orq torque x10 so
this is the x10 carbon I haven't
actually used this properly we're just
going to take it apart and see what's
going on underneath so the mouse does
use in a vago sensor it is an a DNS 9800
sensor that was very standard a couple
years ago these days a lot of the mice
are moving towards the EMW 3366 and
there's also a split towards split
between optical and laser so for the x10
they use a laser sensor that's the adns
9800 avago is the tech company that
makes that and then for their x5 EVGA is
using a pic start sensor which logitech
showed us a couple years ago as well and
it's fairly popular then but industry's
changed a bit there's been innovation
and advancement in sensors so this is
something we're going to take apart mice
are difficult to work with any doing a
teardown because there's a good chance
it doesn't go back together quite the
same way even if it all works at the end
these Teflon feet are a nightmare
because they are I mean once you take
them off and there's screws hidden under
there almost one hundred percent of the
time once you take them off they don't
really go back on quite the same way so
this is not something I recommend doing
to your mouse if it's something that you
want to use in perfect order at the end
but let's get down to it so the x10 has
no visible screws other than this one
this is a screw that allows some kind of
minimal level of adjustment of the mouse
itself it's got a metal frame on the
underside or just a metal chassis and
then the body on this particular model
is actually legitimately carbon right
here anyway this is plastic but this is
actually carbon fiber so that's
normally when they label something
carbon these companies it's not actually
carbon it's just a sticker that's real
carbon fiber the house is still one of
the heavier ones on the market for
current day it's 120 something grams
without weights added we've got a pack
of weights that mermaid out to like 137
or something without the cable and then
for perspective some of the newer mais
coming out are around 100 grams or 110
grams so this is marginally heavier but
let's let's figure out how to take it
apart so I am I think we'll just start
by peeling these feet off I don't know
if that has to come out or not but we
can definitely take it out just to see
what happens I've been warned by Jacob
of the EVGA that this is somewhat
difficult to tear down so we will see
how long the process takes so you can
see kind of the whole thing change when
I do this so that visible so that screw
doesn't completely come out but you get
the idea that is not what we are after
though but I will leave it on screwed
just in case I think what we're going to
have to do is peel these feet off so
these are technically
polytetrafluoroethylene feet commonly
known and I think it just cut part of it
in half teflon that's the sort of brand
name but polytetrafluoroethylene is the
generic name that's what these are we
actually do it back up kid of these that
was included with the mouse I don't know
if that's only the carbon or what the
mouse by the way is a fifty-dollar mouth
these days it's a bit cheaper than what
it shipped but these are the spare feet
so if your mouse doesn't come with these
and you want to do this project there
are actually websites out there where
people will cut teflon to spec of a
mouse and sell it to you I've done that
before for my mice but there's the first
foot ideally we have more of a vinyl to
stick this onto I'll stick it on the bag
for now
hopefully maintain some of the
adhesiveness although I don't know that
we're going to be using this again after
because a lot of its still stuck on
there there's our screws let's go ahead
and take the other one off while we're
at it hey like ninety percent of the
adhesive compound is stuck on the mouse
itself i bet you there's going to be a
screw hidden under that EVGA sticker as
well cool huh it's easier than I thought
no stickers under there or screws under
the sticker rather just for anyone
wondering by the way there's no there's
no method to what I'm taking out it's
just if I see a screw I'm going to
remove it so as I've stated before in
these videos and in this one this isn't
a tutorial don't copy me because you may
not go back together quite the same so
here's what we've got just from the
immediate efforts obviously scroll wheel
and then we've got the centered self so
that is what's reading the output it's a
laser sensor looks at the surface scans
an image of it basically sends that
image to the CPU inside of here it has
an arm 32 bit cpu the CPU looks at the
image looks at the next image and
determines if there's any spurious
motion or if it was an actual intended
user input and that's how you get your
mouse movement that's how it works
so you can see we've got movement there
now for both of these so that's released
of the screw tension here's the next one
let's pull that screw out of the back
all right test different size from those
oh my gosh these screws so there's
here's the price your problem there's a
screw and you're not going to be able to
see it on the camera there's a screw way
down here all the way in that back
corner where the screwdriver currently
is where is it back in there somewhere
I'm not sure if we're meant to get to
that now or later
okay let's now we can get this out so
that bit
that's it's like a metal washer that
just snapped in half but whatever but
again I'm using this masculinity tear
about damaging it so this is really an
incredibly complex set of mechanics they
built under here it's got to be like
something hiding somewhere Oh what just
happened oh I just pulled it harder okay
all right so there's there's something
where's the next this that's got to
reveal something that's still socketed
somehow this is very difficult sub
although this screw was in here
tensioning it all together or if I check
that out all the stuffs are down push
that pin out nice this is now separate
this all them nicely through right
like I don't like how much tension
raised yeah I always see I think things
so I'd like to get inside of here but I
don't know that we're really going to be
able to okay well thanks for figuring
that much I so i'll talk to you about
was week um what's next
oh wait i just noticed that this has a
tab on it under with that if that's
supposed to be accessed oh okay so we
found the serial number oh that's a
weight cartridge so I guess that should
have been obvious that that comes off
because you put to your weights in there
or four maybe but wait cartridge it
looks like there's already weights in
there maybe to make it feel like it's
higher quality than it is switch LED
wheel and then where is everything else
here's your actuators you can see that
almost looks like a cherry MX style
cross plus sign so those plus signs just
like when interacting with the cross
points on the cherry MX which is those
actuate down into there in there and hit
the switch which we'll look at in a
moment but we've got a couple more
screws we can get now
not quite sure what that did
those are magnets okay so before I pull
pry that up there's more screws here
okay so that separates pretty easily
there's your separated lever now not
even a button because it doesn't
interact with anything you've got the
pluses down here for actuating the
switch and there's your diodes if your
light emitting diodes that bleed light
through these acrylic tubes which is
what gives you the LED effect on the top
it's not RGB but it's got r g and b
colors in it and also a couple others
orange pink yellow so from here we've
got these switches that's the DPI up
down and they are whatever they made by
ttc actually the PCB zoom level so it's
a couple PCBs in this mouse there's at
least one here for the DPI and led logic
there's a PCB over here with actually a
vertical one for the scroll wheel PCB
over here and over here they are
separate this is where all of the the
USB is coming in USB power data so I'll
talk into this board and their buttons
for the actual lmb RMB it is omron
switches you can see those right there
the sort of clear colored plastic white
clear plastic that is an armor on switch
rated for 20 million clicks it's not
there 10 billion click model which we
can tell by looking at it the switch for
the scroll wheel if you're curious when
you push the scroll wheel you know you
have middle mouse button or MMB that
depresses this tube onto the switch
that's within this black housing so
that's how the middle mouse button works
now we're attached to be a cable two
cables one cable okay that looks like
it's dealing with the click input coming
in that's what this cable was routed
here so there's your cable that was this
cable this bigger cable talks to the
encoder which is talking to the sensor
here so they're communicating by that
cable I don't think there's anything
else to see in this part this main part
of the mouse I think we're done with at
this point so we've exposed all there is
to see there the next part of the mouse
now we're down to the sensor now we know
their trick now we know EVGA really
likes prying things apart it's not all
just screws I thought it was a much more
elegant solution that it was not to say
it's bad because I mean why would you
ever access this once it's built so just
clip it in but I was looking for screws
and things like that when clearly that
was not the thing to look for I believe
these are ttc switches as well so left
and right right there you can see that
the black box has another tiny white
switch in it that's what's actuated move
all the cables out of the way and now we
can see the sensor with the a logo on it
above my thumb that's the avago sensor
and it is in fact an 80 80 and s a 9800
sensor where's the rest of that thing so
there's that's what's reading through
right there is the 80 and s 9800 going
through that side with laser so this is
actually a pretty complex mouse in terms
of its build not necessarily saying it's
good or bad but just PCBs alone some of
the high and logitech mice for PCB is
fairly complex
44 mouse this one you've got one here
kind of one main unit with the power and
data obviously another one to host the
switches over there and then several
boards in here one is the main sensor
PCB you've got to side ancillary ones
for the side button inputs I think
that's pretty much it I think we've seen
all that there really is to see for this
mouse I don't know if it'll ever go back
together that was a huge panda yes but
that is maybe minimally you can end up
in kind of a display in the case or
something in the future if we expand but
that's what we've got for all the parts
they kind of vaguely go like this this
is in here somewhere as well there is
the key plate there's that so the way
this key plates designed right here when
it pushes down on the buttons it's kind
of a it's not always a linear force all
the way up and down the plate that's
just how they designed the mouse hat
it's easier to press towards the end
then up here that's not the case with
some of the higher-end device but
overall not a bad design I haven't used
it ultimately at the end of the day all
that matters is what you think of it in
gaming this wasn't something we were
really planning to use because frankly
there's no time to review scheduled for
this mouse which is now more than a year
old i believe but build quality is kind
of neat just to see how it's all put
together very complex so that's the EVGA
whatever it's called that's the EVGA
torque x 10 carbon mouse tore it down
spent on the market for a while its
forty or fifty dollar mouse I can't say
if I'd recommend it or not but because
it's a really personal preference thing
haven't really used it but we took it
apart and it's kind of cool so if you're
interested in I guess looking more into
it I'll put it length ascription below
that will be an affiliate link otherwise
we keep getting questions about the
tools used during these and I ignore Lee
reply in the comments but I'll just go
ahead and put a link in the description
for the tool sets used as well if you
are curious I fix it to not sponsor
these videos but they did provide the
tools and they're an upgrade over what
we were using so I'm happy to recommend
them all that stuff's in the link but
patriotic emotional video how was not
directly thanks for watching as always
tweet the set Jacob at EVGA or something
let them know that we immediately
destroyed the mouse that he sent yeah
I'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
