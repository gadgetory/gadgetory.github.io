hardware news recap for the past week
it's been a really busy week in the
world of hardware news so we have an
exclusive item on GT X 1080 TI stock
being almost gone sad news for people
who've been trying to buy Pascal up
instead of RT X cards and then we've
also got an investigation we're starting
up on the debt 20 ATT eyes we'll be
talking about that or well dead we don't
know how widespread it is we know that
definitely some of you had dead xx ATT
eyes because you are sending them to us
for further inspections so we'll be
looking at some of that coming up soon
and then Intel poaching more AMD talent
SSD prices falling potentially as low as
8 cents per gigabyte the lowest that
we've seen ever I think and that could
be in 2019 and is on track TSMC is
making a lot of Intel chips right now to
assist in Intel's current manufacturing
deficiency and we have more than that
before that this video is brought to you
by NZXT is new h 500 case which we
recently found to have an impressively
effective cooling setup that is entirely
negative pressure when stock the H 500
is the successor of the s3 40 and s 340
a lead offering high build quality
that's all steel and glass and Cale
management features that are also a top
class for the $70 compact mid tower case
H 500 is a part of NZXT Zanu H series
lineup which also features options from
Mini ITX micro ATX and full ATX builds
learn more at the link in the
description below
quick note first we have the order
placed for the oil graph logo shirt the
limited edition one we have the size
distribution now so at this point we've
got a decent amount left in stock for
maybe another week and then they'll be
gone it's pretty close to sold out at
this point
so if you want to get an order in on
this shirt then go to store documents
taxes dotnet and place your order soon
because once these sell out we are not
restocking them and won't be making more
and that is the foil graph logo shirt in
limited edition so check that out first
item here for News the GTX 1080i this
has been sort of a really in in light of
RT X I think it has become a favorite
status card it's easy to like the 1080
TI given its current price performance
ratio when can
during the newer cards on the market and
considering that the 2080 wasn't really
all that we would have liked to see for
performance increments and rasterization
so the 1080i then you'll be sad to hear
potentially that it is exit has exited
production and stock is low it's been
out of production for a little while now
NVIDIA hasn't made more of them but the
board partners the folks who actually
make the aftermarket cards are almost
out of stock from the sources with whom
we've spoken and we do trust those
sources greatly so so we we believe that
at this point the 1080i hasn't been in
production for a while so it's pretty
believable that it's almost out of stock
especially considering we have sales
data on this because we get that Amazon
affiliate sales data from when people
buy stuff through our links and when the
twenty eighty and twenty ATT I launched
looking at the video cards sold to
people in our audience like you all the
1080i sales skyrocketed way past the
twenty series we've never seen that
before
at a product launch for GPUs so uh
Nvidia moved a lot of ten series when
the twenty series launched anyway they
are almost gone so the high on the GTX
cards will soon be completely supplanted
by the RT X twenty eighty at the 1080i
class and then of course twenty ATT I
had a bit higher than that Titan class
or beyond and Nvidia's biggest
competition at this point to its twenty
series has been the 1080 Ti at least to
the twenty eighty in twenty eight ETI
cards so we're not sure if this will
impact price at all one early theory we
had was that perhaps the higher prices
on our TX would come down as Pascal sold
through but that's only going to be true
if there's a lack of purchases and our
TX cards because people are buying them
anyway because all the high intensity is
gone that's all you can buy why would
they bring the prices down
so separately from this separately from
the sad news that there will not be any
restock of the 1080i and the the stock
is almost gone at this point in the US
market anyway we also heard that
manufacturers are trying to pull in
inventory to fill stateside warehouses
for North American customers that would
include Canada because the tariffs that
are coming in
it looks like beginning of next year
beginning of 2019 there's
apparently going to be another tariff
hike and manufacturers are trying to
bring an inventory into their warehouses
because a lot of the inventory that
comes in comes through US ports so even
if you're in Canada you are affected by
these price hikes because the price
increase from the tariff will take
effect at the u.s. port it doesn't
matter if it's going to Canada
ultimately or not so manufacturers
they're bringing more stuff in because
anything that comes in ahead of that
increase will dodge the price increase
the charges and this affects it nearly
every company in the u.s. computer
hardware market anyone who works with
metals or electrical components so
basically everyone memory is
surprisingly not affected and SST is not
affected so that's why you see those
prices continuing to fall partly anyway
because manufacturing is the other side
of it but things like video cards
motherboards cases those are all
affected fans coolers all that stuff
anything that's seen it's kind of a DIY
part memory for whatever reason was not
included in there so that's that's
interesting news for you but otherwise
we're working on an investigation on the
dead twenty atti
cards you may have heard about this it's
been big news in the last week we've
been kind of quiet on it as we've been
talking to board partners s eyes and
video to some extent trying to figure
out what's going on with both on record
and off record sources and to give you a
quick recap if you don't know anything
about this the short version is that
Digital Trends posted a report last week
or early this week that the 28th ETI
early adopters were facing die-off
issues on their cards comments on Reddit
and Nvidia's forums arranged from
bricked cards crashes artefacts memory
artifact in bsod SC T DS stuff like that
and what's more some of the reports are
after going through the RMA process with
a second or even a third card and you
start reading this and if you see
someone who's had maybe three card
failures you start wondering okay is it
the users fault at this point but in
fact this is apparently happening to a
lot of people so we're gonna step in
here and I'll get to the more of that in
a moment but to finish up the recap we
did ask nvidia for comment and nvidia
noted that the company is working with
individuals on a per card basis but they
do not see broad issues
which is really pretty much an expected
response at this point as for board
partners we spoke with pretty much all
of them that you're familiar with and
from everyone we've spoken with again
several of these sources we've used four
highly credible stories in the past and
trust them all the board partners told
us the same thing which was that they
are not seeing higher than usual RMA is
on their cards they're seeing RMA is of
course everyone does but at this point
some of them were as low as below 0.1%
even below 0.01 percent and that's not
not because the cards are perfect it's
because they're so new and there hasn't
really been enough time in the market
for failure to even occur from people to
buy them in enough quantity that they
can discover bad cards or defects or bad
batches whatever so our May is really
low right now and we'll need to wait a
bit longer to see how the rates compared
to previous generations as we go but the
partners by and large actually in
totality told us that they are not
seeing the types of issues people are
describing online so what does that mean
well if we look at the types of failures
the most common reported online seems to
be the founders Edition and there's a
bit of confirmation bias here from some
people there's questions of you know you
start spending this much money the user
is more likely an enthusiast if they're
spending 1,300 bucks
they're more likely to use things like
Reddit Twitter social media we're likely
to try and watch YouTube or read
articles online so the chance of
reporting a bad card goes up as opposed
to maybe like a GT 1030 where it's
someone who's probably not really
involved in the community so it's really
hard to isolate that signal-to-noise
versus is this actually a problem which
is what we're trying to do right now and
probably lots of other people including
an Nvidia so then if the problems are
largely on the founders edition cards
and there are a couple of failures we've
seen reported on some of the gigabyte
cards for example Asus card EVGA and for
those brands all the ones we've seen
reported thus far have been four cards
using the reference board so whether
there is any correlation there it's it's
hard to say well there is correlation we
don't know if there's causation for
really anything so really hard to know
what's going on right now but basically
people are seeing artifacting if you're
seeing that please contact us because
speaking with si speaking with board
partners we've heard that this is not
something they're seen so they haven't
been able to help us troubleshoot and
typically they're pretty good about
helping with that and video of course
says they're not seeing broad issues
they're working on individually
certainly they're not going to work with
media on proving that it's a huge
problem so we have a few theories on
this we've seen some other ones too some
of the theories we've seen some around
memory overheating I'll remind you we
did GDD our six thermal testing in our
twenty atti review and it did not in the
worst case test it did not go over about
81 degrees Celsius and that's just flat
that's not over ambien it's just flat 81
degrees Celsius the internal dye will be
a bit hotter than that but is it hot
enough to cause damage artifacts and
things like that it's kind of hard to
say that's why we are getting in the
dead cards from you all to look into it
further we did do one test when we did
that hybrid mod with no cooling on the
memory whatsoever and yeah it hits like
a hundred degrees Celsius but that's
because there's literally nothing
cooling it did not crash or anything
like that didn't throttle certainly it's
very bad to put your card through that
for a long period but we'll be looking
into that more so anyway the point is
there's not something like a t.j.maxx
function on memory here if it's
overheating it will overheat until
something bad happens and that's likely
going to be artifacting typically if a
vrm component fails it's a puff of smoke
and goes black you don't get it back you
don't get any video output again if it
is a significant important component so
the fact that most these people are seen
artifacting does point toward either an
in silicon problem with the memory or
with the GPU itself likely the memory
just based on the types of errors we're
seeing we have some other theories but
these are pure speculation so Nvidia
when we took apart the founders edition
cards we did notice that Nvidia several
different types of thermal pads for all
the components on the boards and when we
asked them why this is it's basically a
supply-side thing they they can get more
pads through more sources so they did
that and theoretically as long as
they're all about the same thickness
that should be fine but there is some
chance for error there there's chance
that a pad
it's missed on a component there's
chance that a pad isn't thick enough to
make contact and so that could
potentially lead it into the overheating
theories but there's nothing to really
confirm that although the vapor chamber
blocks all access to air for the PCB so
if there is an overheating issue there's
no chance of a secondary fallback from
Eric Coyne
so that's speculation here's what you
need to do if you have a dead or dying
28 ET I we would love for you to contact
us that we can analyze it you can email
us at a special email address which is
dead 28 ET i at gamers nexus dotnet
that's de AD
28 ET i at gamers nexus net with
information on your court your card what
you're seeing it do and please tell us
what country you're in so we can start
thinking about logistics for shipping us
is easier but we will work with you
internationally although if you're on an
RMA deadline that's probably not going
to be easy to do but if you're not if
you haven't filed an RMA yet and you
want to loan us the card temporarily
please email us send it out to us we'll
look at it figure out if there's a
commonality or a common thread between
all the cards we're getting we already
have five lined up via Reddit and we're
hoping to get more so we have a reddit
post where people have been offering
their cards and then what we'll do is
we'll send it back to you of course
we're paying for shipping both ways send
us the receipts we will send you some
kind of GN merch and return let us know
your shirt size maybe and then once you
get it back file your RMA and you can
point them at our our content if they
have any questions whatsoever about if
the card you know is experiencing a real
issue and also we're not really
concerned about violating warranties
here we don't I mean we're not going
through so if you're concerned about if
what we're doing will violate the
warranty what we're doing doesn't need
to violate warranties so if that is a
concern for you feel free to ask about
why it shouldn't be in the email and
we'll explain it because we've got a
pretty good plan here so anyway that's
the plan thus far the reddit thread has
garnered about five dead twenty atti
samples at the time of this video going
up we're still looking for more and we
are hopeful that we can figure out a
common thread we're gonna take down
serial numbers on every component on the
board take down serial numbers on the
boards on the GPUs
we'll be replacing well so for one
example if it is a thermal problem we
can just blast the card with loads of
air and see if the problem subsides
potentially use water blocks things like
that so we're hopeful we can start to
narrow this down but check out the the
show notes linked in the description
below for more information on this or if
you just want to copy face the email
send us an email and this is a a service
for the community at this point it's
gonna cost me a whole lot of money to
ship all those cards back and forth but
it's worth it it'll be fun
and you know hopefully we got some ROI
of course by doing the reporting but
we'll see what we'll see what happens it
is something that should just be kind of
fun though and good for the community to
understand what's going on intel
poaching more ande talent so Daren
McPhee is now joining the growing list
of former AMD employees moving over to
Intel Intel has recruited the employees
into its discrete GPU business over the
past year or two at this point and
alongside Darin McPhee Intelli has hired
other former discrete graphics employees
at and these Radeon division including
Raja Kaduri who was largely in charge of
Vega Intel has hired Chris hook one of
the marketing directors at AMD for a
long time now it's hired Jim Keller
formerly of Andy an architect status and
also technical analyst and former tech
reviewer Ryan trout from PC perspective
has joined Intel's ranks as a chief
strategist I believe is his title so
Intel's really pushing that RTG the RTG
be counter to RTG the discrete graphics
group and Darren McPhee is the newest
one he's joined to Intel as their
director of product marketing for
discrete graphics next a news item SSDs
could hit 8 cents per gigabyte in 2019
this is this is some good news for
everyone so in a new report from digit
times NAND prices are expected to
continue their downward trend in 2019
and that's likely not news anyone who's
been following our hardware news
segments for the last few months but
what is news is that projections are
calling for the prices to be as low as 8
cents per gigabyte this is a new low
estimate that we haven't seen before
checking
Amazon to confirm what's out there now
today we found 250 gigabyte SSDs the
crucial MX 500 is certainly a fine SSD
it's not like some garbage class drive
and that one at 250 gigabytes
along with these Samsung 860 Evo at 250
gigabytes those to work out to be about
24 cents per gigabyte or thereabouts
and the 50 is $4 50 55 60 so somewhere
in there and one terabyte SSDs have been
on the 150 price range lately of course
it goes up as you get like Pro Class
drives and things like that so it's a
massive move down in price but it
doesn't look like it's going to be going
back up anytime soon either will link
some of the affordable SSDs we've found
in the description below for people who
would like to pick up and ask to see
what the current prices but you don't
need to panic purchase this isn't like
some temporary sale it's looking like
this is probably going to be a trend at
least through the end of the year and
potentially will continue in the 2019 so
good news for people who would like to
move on to SSDs or get bigger ones for
your game drives and move away from
archival hard drives another item here
so this is a rumor rumor alert on that
our rx 590 actually not that much for
rumor its allegedly faster than a 10 60
and could release in November so we know
that the RX 590 at this point based on
what's out there is basically a thing
and the rumors have been circulating
regarding this latest AMD polaris
refresh we reported previously on the
590 rumors last week after it landed on
the 3dmark
database and now the RX 590 has shown up
on square enix is a horrible Final
Fantasy 15 benchmark but it's on the
scoreboard there and at various
resolutions the RX 590 comes in anywhere
from six to nine percent faster or there
abouts than the competing 1066 gigabyte
card this would appear to be a more
realistic performance target compared to
previous rumors even though Final
Fantasy 15 s benchmark is far from ideal
additionally the RX 590 could release as
soon as November for a price of about
300 dollars the rumors and leaks have
suggested a 12 nanometer shrink for this
but no architectural change at least not
a massive one this could mean higher
clocks and power efficiency would be the
chief upgrade certainly that is what
would happen if there is a shrink but
that's about that's about what we be
looking at for the RX 590 tsmc is now
making anti
Celeron atom and Pentium CPUs this is
pretty big news cuz Intel's been making
its own stuff for a long time now by and
large and given recent shortages of 14
nanometer and production limitations fab
capacity limitations intel has had to
outsource some of its production for
actually a significant part of its
portfolio including some of its chipsets
because they've got some factories
pushing back to 22 nanometer for low-end
chipsets they have TSMC stepping ends
make veins and digitized reports that
amidst the Intel manufacturing crisis
the company's offloading its bottom and
SKUs to TSM see this comes after Intel
made it known that tsmc would be
fabricating some of their low end
chipsets something we reported on
previously to help free up fab space for
the highly in demand 40 nanometer
silicon pending 10 nanometer production
as techpowerup notes digitize does not
expressly name that TSM C is the
fabrication plant chosen for Celeron
atom and Pentium CPUs but it is the only
one that meets Intel's current criteria
so short line to draw to get to that
conclusion quick one here on a Suso asus
is launching new tough gaming laptops
that's t UF asus is taking pre-orders
for the new tough series of gaming
notebooks these are the tough FX v o5 +
FX 705 interestingly both of the new
models conform to the mill st st d810 g
standard so back to the mill spec back
to the the mil-std spec apparently the
military standard specification is
apparently a testing requirement that
devices much must withstand harsh or
extreme conditions and speaking
truthfully I've actually worked with
this back before I know that one of my
my previous employers did test for
example ruggedized notebooks using
military specifications the difference
there was that those were literally
going to a war zone but as such HTS
claims that the new laptops can
withstand us solar radiation is one of
the stronger points high altitudes
extreme climate exposure and so forth
the new tough models will ship with
coffee lake mobile parts 144 Hertz IPS
panels
10 series GPUs to check out the product
pages I guess if you curious about those
the thing we always kind of wonder about
these are mused about these is that this
is absolutely a market segment that
needs to be fulfilled there are
researchers there are members of the
military there are people who go to the
Arctic for research science things like
that who can use this type of component
I suppose the curious part is how much
of that is getting used leveraged for
gaming versus are those GPUs actually
legitimately useful for the types of
science being done
so anyway laptops I guess next one
Walmart and last one
Walmart is trying to break into the PC
market sort of embarrassingly as Walmart
does so are not content to be left out
of any market that it can attempt to get
its hands all over its partnered with
eSports Arena to bring their own gaming
PC lines market dubs overpowered and the
the Walmart overpowered line of gaming
machines will comprise of one desktop
currently and a pair of laptops you're
curious about the parts here you go the
desktop will offer an i7 8790 PU it will
have a GTX 1080 it will have 32
gigabytes of RAM and it's got a 512
gigabyte SSD 2 terabyte hard drive will
reportedly go for $1,900 retail the
laptops will come in at 15 inch 17 inch
variants offering 144 Hertz screens with
unknown panel types 10 series GPUs 1060
or 1050 and either an i5 8300 H or I
78750 H and prices are $1,000 to 15 inch
or 1700 for the 17 inch notebook so the
specs are a bit I mean this is what do
you expect I guess from Walmart at this
point 32 gigabytes of RAM it just it
seems like this is so common for the
OEMs that really don't get it where they
just fill it with RAM they like it's got
four slots damn it let's put four sticks
in it that's what they there for so it
just it just seems like they don't quite
get that if it's genuinely a gaming
machine it probably doesn't need 32
gigabytes of memory
it depends on your market if you're
targeting someone who might be a content
creator shirt but if you're just going
for the gamer who it's Walmart it's real
to hit retail store so likely its
parents buying these things for their
kids and it's just it's gonna figure it
out Walmart I guess is what I'm saying
because if it's parents buying it for
kids it just doesn't seem likely that
those kids are going to be thirty two
gigabytes of RAM then again I don't know
my job is gonna be taken by probably a
fifteen year old at some point because
that's the way YouTube goes so that's it
