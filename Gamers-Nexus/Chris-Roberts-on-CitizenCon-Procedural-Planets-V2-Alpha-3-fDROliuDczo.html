offices in Santa Monica California to
talk with Chris Roberts about procedural
generation for planets version 2.0 and
we also talked about expectations for
alpha 3.0 coming out soon and featuring
demos at citizencon we talked to Shawn
Tracy as well as interviews will be
uploaded separately and before getting
to that content this is brought to you
by an tech with their new cube case
designed by Razer a mini ITX solution
that uses an aluminum outer shell and
acrylic windows for the side panels
well actually I mean so I mean we all
walk on through yo we got a couple
things work out but we're working on it
squadron 42 obviously and we're going to
show a little bit of that at citizencon
we have two six which is gonna have star
marine which is the sort of FPS game
mode with all bunch of improvements for
the you know the gameplay when you
really PS so we just showed this video
about the kind of vision stabilization
tech we put in which is essentially
mimicking what the human eye or the
brain does when you're moving around and
if you actually you know like that
camera it attaches your head around your
lettuce camera does this and that's not
the way you perceive it when you run
around right and it's important because
we unify the characters so we don't have
a separate animation we don't have a
separate mesh or skeleton for when
you're in first person from third person
so every pretty much every first-person
shooter out there has a separate
animation and specific like body
positions for the first you know so you
can see your hands in front of you and
if you actually pulled out a
third-person view it would look really
weird or bits of the body we're missing
so I think you can actually go online at
people there's sort of glitches where
you go in crisis too and sort of see the
character stretching and moving around
or in a bunch of other other places like
counter-strike and stuff with
battlefield
yeah battlefield there so pretty much
everyone does I think I'm kind of does
the same thing we do
there's a lot but the biggest issue for
us is to sort of have the they all feel
really he's sort of smooth but because
like usually what happens the night Call
of Duty you have all these beautiful
animations when you're interacting with
stuff but it's all from first-person and
it's all in single-player and if you
play the multiplayer the animation sets
much more limited and that's the Tres
true also and they did crisis for
multiplayer for the reasons that there's
a disparity between what you see in
first-person view when you're faking it
and what really happening and for us we
don't so we don't cheat at all so like
where our gun points is where we're
shooting right that's another big
difference almost every FPS point is
wherever the sensor your screen is is
where your way where your shoot and your
gun and everything else is just sort of
actually sort of move generally in that
direction and the bullets do not fire
straight from the muzzle of your gun and
you can in other games whether I've seen
videos for that but definitely you know
like if we went to a third-person view
when you were watching first person and
say the crisis stuff you could be
pointing this way in there the bullets
would go that way to the center of the
screen so none of those fake so like
when we actually aim you a when you go
down the sights character actually does
all this everything so it's all 100%
accurate and one of the reasons is so
that when you're running around and
you're doing stuff with your friends
what you see them do is actually what
they're doing and that's really
important I think that's kind of and
we're probably doing that to a level I
don't think anyone else has done that
and I think it's good and that that's
more important for star citizen that is
for squadron 42 the squadron 42
single-player game so we could have
faked it but since we're trying to have
one system that works for everything we
spent a lot of extra time to try to get
this work and it's there's a reason why
a lot of people haven't done it is
because it does take a lot of work so
we're quite happy and proud with where
is we showed it on this video just this
past week that got a fair amount of
pickup and it's very cool so that will
be one big thing that's going to be in
star marine as well as you know
you know that a weapon handling feeling
you know other things like grenades and
and dedicated game modes plus we're
doing a lot of work on arena commander
itself to make that sort of it hasn't
really had a lot of love and attention
since we sort of focused on 2.0 which
was the large world and so we've gone
back we've changed the flight handling
and the marbling and you know balancing
things to be more sort of up-close
dogfighting so we're just about ready to
actually roll out two we have a very
small test group we call the bucket e
bucket I whatever how do you pronounce a
charity evoke RT they got you across it
evoke RT anyway so the evocati they're
like our first wave of community testers
and so they test up very early like it
basically they're really like a QA
department but we've been balancing and
testing some of the flight changes and
model changes it certainly and we roll
out to them and hopefully the the
dogfighting is going to be sort of more
up close and have a bit more of the
original sort of Wing Commander spirits
our sort of speeds had kind of gotten
faster and faster over time which meant
there was a lot of sliding and
overshooting and so we've rebalanced
things and also changed some stuff in
the flight model so that's so those are
gonna be pretty so two six is actually
going to be gameplay wise pretty big
because you know they'll the FPS section
will be there as a gamer mode you can
play plus you know it will have a lot of
additions to make it more fluid the gun
handling better all the rest stuff and
the arena commando side of stuff will
have had a lot of attention to make that
better and make it more robust and the
matchmaking of the lobby and the UI and
all that so so we're sort of focusing to
try and make the experience of just
jumping in and dogfighting or jumping in
and running running and gunning to be
fun and that's what 2/6 is and so that
will be released sometime after the
citizen car which is this October 9th
and then long term what we're working
towards is what we just what we sort of
showed it games con which was sort of
the preview of 3 0 &amp;amp; 3 0 is probably the
first time you can say that
when you get out there and you fly
around you know it will be it will feel
like a full game or a complete game
because you'll be able to go between
locations buy and sell stuff you know
and money do all the sort of things you
normally would do and say something like
a privateer or a freelancer and so
that's the sort of first step to
persisting universe getting fully
fleshed out me there's a lot more to be
done right so there's a lot of like
locations world systems additional
professions because we're going to start
with just cargo sort of hauling you're
buying selling training mercenary bounty
hunter piracy which is sort of that
they're kind of the core professions and
most sort of space games right so you're
either taking stuff for me to be you're
either protecting someone taking stuff
for me to be you're trying to rob
someone taking stuff from A to B oh
you're going after someone that's robbed
someone going to edit right so those are
kind of what all those professions work
with and then you know longer term
there's a lot of sort of secondary
professions whether it's sort of rescue
and recovery or you know going out and
refueling people they're out of fuel or
mining or Salvage
so those are sort of professions that
will be coming along sort of after we
get the first but out and you know we're
concentrating four-30 to try and have
one star system roughed in so it's not
going to be done fully polished but at
least a major location should be there
or mostly there which would include a
whole bunch of not just the landing
locations of which I think we have five
major ones there but also a whole
network of space stations and satellites
and refueling stations and all the rest
that you would stop off in your in your
sort of travels around the star system
because for us the star system itself
has like among a lot greater density of
like action
you know interest it's not just you sort
of stop and there's one space station
that you go and trade in and you leave
and get another star system for us just
this star system shouldn't be something
that a player can spend a whole bunch of
time going back and forth and and you
know now with the new sort of planetary
tech that we've done you can many if you
see a planet as long as it's not the Sun
which would probably burn you you can
you know land on it and go around and
adventure around so so there's gonna be
a whole bunch of stuff for three zeros
so it's a huge huge huge task so we are
in the process of you know doing a whole
bunch of stuff towards that along the
way we're going to show a preview of the
next stage of the planetary tech that we
have which will be at citizencon so
we're going to what we call planet
procedural planets v2 which is a which
is a lot more artist authored and driven
so it uses so it uses procedural
techniques the same way that world
machine as someone does but it's very
artists driven which is also kind of the
same way world machine is and so we we
use these techniques to allow artists to
build a world out at scale but they're
determining where the contents are
they're determining where the forests
are where the mountains are where the
desert planes are and it's pretty cool
how's that determined in the engine when
an artist is this manually going in and
picking locations for different yeah
yeah well that's what happens so we
built there's a bunch of biomes that are
built so the arts are sort of creates
these different biomes whether it's a by
a you know a Mountain biome or a desert
biome or forest biome or a woodland or
whatever you need having the biomes and
then there's an overall sort of map for
the planet and there's both a height map
and a distribution map and the height
maps sort of determining the general
height of the terrain now the biomes
themselves also are additional to that
they so the shapes of the mountains is
sort of a combination of the overall
height map and
by ohm data and then the distribution
map is determining like where the say
trees of the vegetation is and and
that's kind of how they sort of build it
so it's almost like imagine you start
with just a sphere and you know
ultimately I mean right now I don't
think we paint our height map on the
sphere although I think we may be able
to now we can now right so originally we
just did on a texture map but I the
ultimate idea is you have the sphere
here and what we call planet ad and you
basically just sculpted so you can push
or pull it like you would in a sculpting
program for the height map and then you
would paint on top for the distribution
map like Oh his desert is forest area or
whatever and then based on that and the
biomes you've created it creates the the
world is sort of so you're like sort of
painting on a great scale so and then on
top of that besides just that general
distribution mapping the height map you
can go in and specifically paint areas
and you can paint areas with no brushes
that you can go you know all the way
from you know a few meters in size all
the way to hundreds of kilometres inside
and then you specify what's going to be
in your brush you so I'm going to paint
this with some trees or rocks whatever
and you can paint on a basically a
planetary scale and so that allows the
artist to totally craft their
environment and they can they can also
place specific art so they can create
like you know I don't know it's a
mineshaft or ruins or something and they
can basically carve out an area in the
planet and place that in it so it's very
much built as a tool to allow them to
build this at scale so I guess if you
think of the sort of tools they had for
CryEngine on a much smaller scale for
you know building the the maps they had
imagined that but on a planetary scale
sure and that's an S and that's what
we've been working on and v1 was that we
showed at Gamescom was a much earlier
more rudimentary version the new version
that we're going to
show is I think gonna be pretty
impressive especially considering it's
on a planetary global scale and we are
doing some like crazy stuff so not sure
if it will although I suspect it may do
but now we're doing planetary clouds and
the planetary clouds themselves are
going to be similar simulated by a full
weather simulation so we're not doing a
flow map anymore we've sort of decided
that a flow map wasn't going to be
tenable for artists to maintain that in
terms of textures and everything so what
would happen is the biomes themselves
would specifically and they and and the
artists building can get errors and say
yeah this is a you know this is a high
area this is a cold area or whatever and
then based on that it will it will drive
and create the the weather ecosystem and
clouds so if you time-lapse the planet
you should see weather systems and
everything's free yes we said we talked
about procedural generation really early
in the process maybe a year ago
and they think back then one of the key
points you're driving is that it's not
randomly seed generate a bunch of stuff
there's actually artists and on hands-on
with the planets so is that true for I
guess on a grander scale for all the
planets in the game is this everyone's
got their hands on a planet at some
level or yeah yeah no Sara means Indy so
so there will be artist and designer
involvement in every single planet or
moon that will be in the game now of
course we'll have set up some you know
we'll set up a whole palette of biomes
and an artist should be able to crank
out a moon or even a base planet in a
day or two days themselves which
relatively considering the fact they're
doing you know like in the case of a
world 16 million kilometer square
kilometres a 16 billion it's quite a
minute or it's a lot and after what what
memory yeah very very big compared to
what you'd normally do in a map which is
you something like four by four
kilometres or something it's pretty
impressive but yeah the tools are all
built up so they can build these things
at scale but it's but it is authored so
you know but we will like four moons you
know there's
means it will kind of like look the same
and we'll have like a moon set of
various biomes and you know you could
probably you know an artist could
probably crank out you know five moons
or six moons in a week for you because
once you've got your building blocks
something's been quicker but everything
yeah there isn't going to be a matter
where we hit a magic number and it's
like poof it comes up we are we are
designing it the game is very design
which means that as we build out the
universe you know it's not a matter of
us just turning something on we actually
have to create those so one over you
know the long term you know sort of
schedule challenges as is building out
the universe that we've you know we you
know in all the stretch cars I think we
got up to 100 star systems I think we
actually have about 110 now we're not
going to have all all of them done for
the day we say it's released early on to
kind of dumb but we're gonna try to get
you know a good chunk of them through so
the creation of all those planets with
you know the additional interest because
it's not just about a planet it's about
the planet you know with its local you
know ecosystem in terms of life so you
know the way our plans to have you know
whatever animals or creatures down there
but also you know not just the major
landing locations but you know other
smaller locations and those in fact a
this week's around the verse there's a
little piece where the the German studio
is talking about some of the model are
building sets they're using four
satellites and using for a little you
know habitats right so the idea would be
that we would have these sets and then
you could you could say well you know
this kind of area the planet you know
maybe there's some some you know farmers
or settlers and it would also you could
either hand play some of these pretty
quickly like BAM here's a little farm or
you can have a set of it and you could
just sort of determine that from the
distribution map there would be X
percent chance of having some of these
old homesteads and so because that's all
important to make the these worlds sort
of feel rich and detailed and not just
for the empty of life the authoring
tools that the artists are working with
you've got it's different biomes at the
top level you were saying
manually plays specific objects or
Bruins things like that anything else in
there for the actual toolset well well I
mean the world of music so in the biome
itself by the way the band itself isn't
just say some of the art the biome
multiple you will have like all the
rules for like whether there's like
creatures in that biome and some of the
logic and interest that would happen
with it and then the system is it's
taking it takes some of that not all of
it so that's the that's kind of like
some of the magic of how the biomes get
a pride
it doesn't take literally the whole bio
verbatim it's that's like a blueprint
that it takes some of it and blends it
with other elements that it's close to
and there's various rules for how it
gets done so that way it doesn't all
feel like it's carbon copy the other
biomes but the biomes ultimately will
contain much more data than just you
know here's the rocks here's the trees
here's the you know here's what the
mountain looks like it may will contain
the rules for wildlife and all the rest
of stuff is that all dying
CryEngine or this is a separate tool and
I told them it's all done in you know we
don't call it crazy
that's correct we call it storage yes
it's quite it's quite detached now for
what the base CryEngine is so yeah we do
it in in the editor so we there's a
whole section the other two called
planet head that you open up and that
allows you to specify and build the
biomes and everything and then in the
actual editor view you can do whatever
you want and then you can improve zoom
right down to ground level it's pretty
pretty awesome
what so I guess when talking about
procedural generation the tour challenge
that would be faced I would think is a
concern of having too much copy paste
like you were just talking about so the
rules that are in there does this is
this the system or the computer kind of
looks at what's surrounding the area
performs all calculations I guess based
on more rules yeah yeah well so
basically what happens is the the the
you know the biomes depending on which
biomes next to the other by oh there's
blending rules that happen and there's
blending on multiple levels to centers
so there's sort of different levels of
detail and they all get blended and then
if you had say two or three versions of
the forest biome then it would also be
picking between those and elements in
them as its as its distributing the
stuff right so I mean the concept is
that you should not really be able to
look in the area and feel like there's a
repeated time and they've you know on
the Neo v2 stuff it's it's pretty pretty
impressive that I mean if you pull out
the repeated stuff is kind of the same
repeated stuff you see in real life so
if you actually look at Earth from
certain levels you can actually do it in
you know Google Earth if you want but
you pull out to a certain level you can
sort of see it looks you know the
mountain ranges and stuff like there
could be there could be tile so but we
we've spent a lot of I you know not
quite sure how many is it four or five
blends I don't know
the texture we blend a lot of so we
blend it different like scales of
texture so when you come down because
our big challenge is you can see this
planet from orbit and you folks fly
above it from 20,000 feet or you can be
walking you know amongst a forest and
all of it needs to hold up to our sort
of Texel density so when you come down
we need to have the detail in the ground
and the rocks and the trees all match up
to what you're used to when you're
sitting in a ship going around say a
constellation or you're on the space
station and stuff and so that involves
having sort of different sets of
textures that are also pub mapped and
various different items that get
distributed and have different LEDs that
match all the way from sort of being
there on the ground in first person all
the way to you know in orbit this is a
bit all version 2.0 procedural
generation yeah I mean some of some of
the blending some of that texture stuff
was and what we shown at Gamescom I mean
you could see in the games can you can
see it from this is UK you came down and
then you can see up close that the
ground texture had decent detail the
difference with 2.0 is a you saw some
popping in in the games come demo when
you're coming in in v2 you see almost no
popping it blends really well and
there's just a lot more variety and so
the planets
have a lot more feeling of a sort of
what you would consider a real planet or
more offered as opposed to that sort of
procedural feel that you get on a lot of
planets so links in the description
below for more information on that we'll
post a link to the robert space
industries website so you can figure out
when that is live stream stuff like that
and as always patreon link from the post
well video if you wanna helps out
directly
subscribe to more content because we
have additional interviews from this
meeting and I'll see you all next time
