with Roman and Roman is is prolific in
the industry he has a YouTube channel he
also makes thermal paste
I'm not gonna ask how but he makes their
own page and then we we have I don't
know what this is so we I asked around
before this video should you brief me on
it first or should we go onto a blind
and we're going into a blind it looks
like Oakland we've cooling and I think
that's a Dominus extreme for the 28 core
CPU 10 out of 10 nice crazy yeah I
thought that was only three or four
things but that's the end of the video
at least one of us can count it before
that this video is brought to you by the
be quiet dark rock slim keeping a high
performance focus but reducing the
footprints to accommodate full memory
slot compatibility the dark rock slim
comes with one of be quiet silent
Wayne's 3 120 millimeter fans built for
low noise operation the dark rock slim
advertises cooling capability up to 180
watts EDP
but mixes in a matte black out color
design to combine performance and looks
learn more at the link in the
description below ok so what do we where
you start with this fittings are pretty
easy so let's save those to later so I'm
calling it link so this is let me stop
you this is going to be an actual
product or just like yeah ok it's a
small out of 10 ok yes so we're making
and earlier actually I told you this
prototype is 7,500 euro which is correct
yeah so that's probably one of the most
expensive prototypes we ever made it's
also fully made in Germany it's it's a
more like a concept idea than just a
month lock itself because what we're
doing in the end is having real full
monoblocks not those like I'm only
cooling the VRMs and see if you
monoblocks but like everything included
because we were also including like the
network chip that's underneath here in
the final state even this block will be
connected to the water cooling with heat
pipes there will be additional heat
pipes going through here what is it that
makes the
at cost seventy five hundred euros
manufacturing in Germany and
manufacturing within three days okay so
yeah we finished it
yeah order last week and then cool so
what is this aluminum yeah alright yeah
top part is aluminum that's very broken
so it's manufactured in three days is
this just acrylic up here yeah it's a
critic in the end this is also aluminum
right now block underneath but a final
part obviously it will be make a plated
copper this is really heavy by the way
like just for a motherboard right yeah
Dominus is already pretty heavy but I
think yeah I think in the back plate off
though which makes it much better yeah
so what makes this kind of specialist
effect that I'm losing the screws but
you lost your screws a long time ago
this have not been there for a while so
what makes it special I see well it
looks like the tubes around the bottom
for that or what somes
what also makes it very expensive in the
end as a product is that we're not only
bundling the mainboard with the
monoblock but also BGA's so everything
is one piece it's a mono block that
includes the VGA so you have the intake
and Alltech on top of the mainboard
right here and that's the only
connection it cools everything ok so
Inlet and outlet here it flows here what
does it hit like like a t-junction or
something to split there's a split
between these two directions or is it
just go this direction so if you enter
here it goes through this channel okay
goes through all the CPU this right half
which is also not final we have a new
model right now where we have an
additional plate on top which will allow
cooling from the centred and outside
through the side okay GUP so it's very
complex cooling in the end goes down in
this channel and then you see those two
connections right here where basically
you're able to attach BGA's okay so
everything is one piece even the VJs are
included and that's the plus there
a connecting piece between these two
will just socket that's basically the
connector right ears and we have a
connector with or rings and it's a
little bit modular so you're flexible in
like five millimeters in this direction
and in this direction right so makes it
a little bit easier because you know
there are some tolerances mounting the
blocks and then if you're off by one or
two millimeters then you can kind of fix
that with this okay yeah special
connector and then in the end you can
have two 28 et eyes or whatever you want
to have on there without any more hard
tubes anymore so I guess you hit like
half the Vav around this way go through
the CPU hit the GPUs as you go yeah go
back up down in there in the left side
and through here and then back to the
vrm and all you know and also the
network check later yeah this will be
connected over a heat pipe to the bottom
of the view and cooler because yeah the
heat of the network chip is not that
much chipsets just done by yeah so this
is just connected to here but this this
would actually be fine the chipset
doesn't even need a cooling okay like
active stones not like x57 either no
it's more like C 390 where you just
remove the PCH heatsink and it's not
really required but it looks much better
but also if it's in a closed case and
you don't have any cooling on it and
yeah you might have a problem what is
the plan
one of ten is it actually just gonna be
ten it's like super limited product or
what yeah I mean it's also gonna be
super super high price I can already
tell that the volume yeah is there a
name for the series the products yeah
it's linked which means liquids
interconnects no Mikey small with the K
it's German right isn't cool the link
only the Dominus extreme or what that
was just to test the concept okay
of having this we actually have a patent
on this on the fact that we can include
everything in the monoblock in addition
to the GPS so adding the GPUs to this we
protected this
yes just to make sure you know I just
I'm just reflecting on the very brief
moment of shock
I said you spelled it wrong like oh no
what have we done
no we've made ten of these all the time
how will we ever remake time it'll take
so long
yeah how long does it actually take I
mean like once you if you're man if it's
not mass production obviously of ten so
like what is the what is the
manufacturing process the manufacturing
progress process is very short it's like
three three weeks roughly okay which
also allows us to do kind of
customization so I don't know for
example if somebody wants to use a very
unique GPU or wants to add some
components we can do that so that's
actually possible so if you're
interested in this very very special
feature can contact caseking and we're
doing that so in the end we're planning
to do like mass production of this for
let's say an extreme Omega okay
abort like that which allows us to have
the space for the distribution so
actually actually mass production on
that yes yeah and it will be
manufactured in-house at caseking done
okay so which makes it a lot more
flexible for us okay so Z 394 that I
guess you're saying for the you said
yeah for extreme omegas
extra 19 I was like yeah the thing is we
need kind of space here in order to be
able to distribute the water through the
BGA we have a second concept where we
had a water channel going like on the
site as well here for smaller boards for
Domino's it didn't really make sense
because we didn't have to add like a
connector from the side to the VGA but
for smaller boards like normal ATX we
have a second concept where we have like
a another water channel coming from here
and then it distributes the water from
the side one additional thing we also
didn't have ready in time unfortunately
is the special backplate we have it's a
backplate that includes a power
connector to here so basically it's
hiding all the cables okay it's a
backplate including a power connector
and then the cable the cable is routed
through here so you have no hard cubes
anymore no cables anymore and
system it will look extremely clean okay
yeah I was about to ask about the two
men you know anything I see that's
what's under here just name oh that's
just that's just a color under the screw
okay yeah so are you selling these with
the Dominus as well or they just buy it
as a kit I mean whatever people want to
have just eat just email case came I
guess yeah that's a special order I know
yeah and it makes sense that they tell
us the special needs I mean we can sell
it individually just a block if they
already have Domino's for example but
yeah did you do anything special on the
GP block design that's like an abnormal
for for now that was very simple that
was just to test functionality we will
have also like centered water
distribution there's mostly yeah that's
already that's already done so the final
stage will have center distribution with
May which made it a lot more complex
because we had to make sure that the
water exits are not restricting the flow
and go back to the GP we was very
complex to do that but yeah actually
this is almost one year development how
how much of this what was your role on
this I mean it was this like 90 percent
your work or were you working with nine
years ninety nine percent okay my work
okay yeah I mean I have a lot of the
testings here yeah I mean I have a guy
at caseking who's doing some CID work
for me but that's all of that so I'm
just giving him like drawings and I'm
telling to do the finals Yeti work but
yeah right everything else is completely
from my handset is the is there anything
else that we've we've skipped over on us
you want to point out or you think we
got it all
I think this price did we talk about
what the price might be for the price
might be something like 2k okay but you
have to keep in mind that remember the
point elation the cooling solution but
it includes so you have vrm cooling you
have CPU cooling you have chipset
cooling network cooling you have the two
blocks four two four two GPUs with a
backplate so if you order all that
individually flat from let's say I don't
know ek or whatever you're already that
one thousands or even more yeah if you
go like high-end
yeah that's why we did it on this board
because this platform is so expensive
5,000 euros I guess yeah it's like but
not final right maybe maybe you plus 10%
better yeah not not sure yet but
something in this direction for sure
yeah because it's it's only 10 pieces
and you know manufacturing in Germany is
not cheap yeah but we have to make sure
that quality is perfectly in line and
yeah easier to check on the factory to
if it's local so you can actually like
stay involved in the process and
customize it like you said yeah the
factory's 15 minutes away from case
games so it's very simple for us to just
go there and do some testing what about
this stuff this is more this looks like
more volume yes that's really this
mainstream volume so we're actually
doing water cooling fittings this is
also is there anything there are a lot
of fittings on the market yeah but the
big difference is if you're into this
business you know you know how it is
it's like you go to the ID cooling
Factory and then you want to yeah have a
cooler or yeah you know holy smokes but
those are 100% my work as well so
everything from design to manufacturing
manufacturing is also not done in any
factory that has anything to do with the
PC components right and just for also
the sake of protecting my work and
soberly can I just go there and say it
wouldn't have the same yeah
I'll get one of what he's getting yeah
yeah well we should talk about that for
a second so for people who everyone in
our audience should mostly know this
people who aren't aware though the
average cooler is made by like maybe two
to three companies like a CLC like
closed-loop yeah so the manufacturers
you're familiar with like Coursera and
NZXT they do have significant input but
they're not literally making it so
there's a big difference there and I
guess you're saying this is you went and
found a manufacturing partner yourself
yeah I mean it's a no it's it's a normal
CNC factory they're just getting the
drawings from us right they're doing the
stuff and then sending over the
individual parts and we were doing the
assembly in Germany right now so that's
the plan we were not I'm not sure if we
will keep the assembly enjoy
because it's quite actually quite costly
but yeah also design wise we decided to
go for something that's very yeah you
can really customize it so all the
fittings have those rings they come in
like six or seven different colors yeah
so there's the plan to sell the reins
individually yes okay so you can get a
set of like ten rings and they're also
not not expensive so the fittings are
actually also quite cheap you know was
the goal to have something that looks
really nice and it's not expensive you
know they're pricey anomalies yeah like
the target price for a heart tube
fitting was like $5.00 okay so yeah so
that's should be very good and you can
see on all of those soft tube fittings
hard tube fittings and all of them can
be equipped with those rings even the
angled ones so those rotary fittings
like 90 degrees or 45 degrees of them
can be equipped with those rings we will
have like the normal nickel-plated ones
also black ones the black ones were not
yet already unfortunately because we had
some problems with the tolerances and
powder coating yeah because you know if
it's not a factory that's familiar with
that you have to take all of that into
account and do it yourself so that's a
lot more work that's why this actually
took three years to make I was just
about to ask ya what's the timeline now
that's too easy I think it's easy as an
outsider to look at a fitting and go
like well I mean it's it's really not
that big and it looks fairly simple yeah
it's like yeah the problem is once you
have your design and your idea what you
want to do and then you have to go
through all the different tolerances and
stuff especially when pieces have to go
together somehow like those rings and
you want to make sure that they're not
loose that would give you a very like
cheap feeling so tolerances have to be
really tight and then you have different
different types of coatings different
nickel plating
yeah and then powder coating and you
have to make sure that all of those
different fittings have like different
raw measurements before coating and all
of that which takes a lot of time
yeah also doing the development
basically from scratch to have like
rotary fittings sounds very simple to
have them but if you start making them
it's actually not that simple to have
them really 100% secure that they're not
leaking I was gonna say that the risk of
the the downside is pretty significant
right like you've you're in a we make
you know a few products to not anything
like this but when you start getting
into that you realize like oh I'm
actually putting my reputation on this
exactly that's gotta be really good yeah
yeah cool I guess last question that is
release target on this do you have a
timeline I mean all of this is it's
pretty much ready okay like all of this
is pretty much final this obviously not
but we have to finance the ad stuff and
doing like the final prototype next week
so someone in our audience is like
incredibly rich and wants one of these
should they send an email now yeah okay
yeah right now because we're doing this
ad stuff right now and if there's any
special import requirement ideas
questions we can do that like even it
can be simple as like engravement on the
cooler but also for example you could
say you don't like the black one you
want to have no no green and green
anodized would also work for example so
any customization is possible and for
the fittings maybe like three months
more to go okay cool
yeah because still we're still working
on the black powder-coated ones it's a
little bit difficult but yeah we're
getting there
finally oh very nice so there's dev our
stuff 99.9 percent of their Bower stuff
anyway and I guess the CAD guy gets
thrown under the boss' might 1% of work
give give Rowan some shit over that when
he gets home so if you want to check him
out and his content I think he's trying
to be a real youtuber this year and
actually visit booths
is that correct are you trying to - yeah
I'm cover stuff you know you know last
year when I was talking to you you told
me that you basically have no time and
you're skipping all the events and
evening yeah so often one sure yeah so
this year I'm skipping everything
interesting
awesome so check out Romans channel for
more of that thank you for joining me
thanks man
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
