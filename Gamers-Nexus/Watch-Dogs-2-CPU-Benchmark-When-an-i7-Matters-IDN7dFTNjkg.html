to publish a full CD benchmark of
watchdogs 2 in our test course as we've
recently found the game to be heavily
thread intensive and responsive to CPU
changes more than anything else a game
even posts fairly sizable games for some
overclocks like on the i-5 2500 K and
establishes a real-world platform of one
CPU choice it matters that's not always
easy to find it is also easy to
bottleneck GPUs with watchdogs to making
it particularly relevant for CPU
benchmarking we've already published
reviews of the i-270 250k the i-5 7600 k
and the i7 7700 k and revisit of the
high five 2500 k most of those contain
watchdogs to data we've been iterating
as we go because it's a good game for
benchmarking CPUs and further published
a CPU optimization guide for the game so
if you're curious about in-depth
granular settings configurations for
wash dogs 2 or just games in general
because it does kind of apply elsewhere
check that guide out but in that testing
that perhaps unsurprisingly we found
that geometry and extra detail most
heavily impacted CPU performance will
put some of those charts back on the
screen now we need to become a CPU
limited in watchdogs 2 geometry and
extra detail should be at first on the
list for reduction as shown in these
charts they are the most impacting these
settings are almost entirely CPU bound
and that makes sense since increasing
the poly count means we're also
increasing the primitives that require
draw calls to be made between a CPU and
the GPU other settings tends to be more
GPU bound and if you're not on an i7
already it's unlikely that you are GPU
bound with watchdogs to the game is so
heavily thread intensive that it really
paves the way for CPU benchmarking for
the year we've even noticed that
watchdogs to it seems to care more about
threads then a frequency so that's not
to downplay the FPS increase we saw on
the 2500 K when overclocking the 4.5
gigahertz but that's getting ahead of
the content for today's benchmark we are
going to be running through our
standardized benchmark course and in
doing so we'll be looking at 1080p with
the high preset and its performance with
the various CPUs with this course we're
using mostly a standardized bench the G
P remains fixed the power supply's SST
all this stuff and you can find all that
defined in the article below
in the testing methodology section as
always if you're curious about what's
used but there are of course some
differences with things like memory
because as you change platforms you
change the memory specification or
compatibility from one motherboard and
architecture to the next so that does
change but again article below for all
of that if you are really curious about
it also defined below are the testing
methods and these at 1% and 0.1% low
values which most of you know at this
point so probably don't need to look
that up but it's there if you need it
and there are some other notes from
technician Patrick lace and as well who
performed this testing now before you
ask why didn't you overclock X why did
you not overclock insert CPU here
everything else you've done is now
irrelevant the answer is because we do
that incrementally so I answer this my
comments every time but just put it in
the video it is literally two times the
amount of work to overclock every CPU
there is a one to one gain and the
amount of work required and there is a
point as a business that it becomes
unsustainable to perform every single
type of test so it's done incrementally
if we don't have overclocked for the
thing that you want
I'm sorry it'll probably be added in a
revisit that's coming up likely sooner
than you think especially with the rise
in reviews inevitably around the corner
for the new tests we're focusing on just
getting a comparative benchmark across
most of the Intel lineup while also
adding in an dandy CPU as we work toward
revention the FX series for the
inevitable arrival again of Rison this
is the first MVC view we've benchmarked
this year been a while since we've done
them so the FX 83-70 is making it read a
beYOU on the watchdog 2 chart all CPUs
tested performed near 60 FPS average as
shown in the data here but some dips
below in averages or in 1% low and 0.1%
low metrics interestingly every single
i7 CPU on the bench evenly aged i7 2610
Sandy
and it's above 54 FPS or greater at
their one percent load in terms of
averages the 2600 K managed to maintain
74 FPS average with the newer 6700 K and
7700 ka CPUs reaching an obvious limit
around 113 to 114 fps none of the i5
CPUs can break 85 FPS with C 7600 K
coming closest and we're clearly
encountering a CP bottleneck on our GT X
1080 FTW with the i-5 in this game we're
also seeing the i3 CPUs dragged behind
but the overclocked 73 50 K does well to
keep up with an i5 4690k stock CPU
landing at 68 FPS average and was the
same at closely timed lows as other
nearby CPUs sky lakes I 3 on the bench
the i3 is 6300 at stock frequency sits
at 54 FPS average with 41 FPS 1% to lows
this is the slowest CPU on the bench and
is behind both the i5 2500 km 2011 and
the AMD FX 8350 1.7 FPS average and 46
FPS 1% load note that the 83-70 is
technically an eighth core chip but keep
in mind that Intel and AMD have very
different definitions of what a core is
a core on Intel is not equal to a core
on AMD so if you're wondering why the
ATT 7 doesn't perform the same as my 7
the answer is architecture with the AMD
FX series we're looking at two integer
units sharing an FPU each which would
mean that performance is in optimal and
games that rely on these types of
floating-point calculations which is a
lot of them there are other changes too
of course cache performs differently
prefetching all of that stuff performs
differently we'll revisit the age of T
17 more depth eventually as we ramp into
the rise in review or check back to the
rise in review for an overview of the
news and architecture overall this tells
us that watchdogs to is an interesting
and good benchmarking platform for CPU
reviews because again this thread
limitation is not a common thing with
games that are CPU limited we often see
that they are more frequency tied than
anything these I 7 CPUs don't really get
to stretch
legs like they'd get to do in watchdogs
to battlefield one for instance shows
these things a lot closer together to
the point where I sevens don't feel like
they matter so much at least not unless
you want 144 FPS or something like that
then the extra few frames matter to
anyone who is in that situation but
that's not normally the case so this is
a unique game for that reason we're
keeping it on the TV bench for that
unique and interesting reason it's a
real-world game that actually uses
threads and these are not completely
absent in the market but they are rare
so that's a good reason to include it
now GTA 5 we recently ditched from our
CPU benchmarks the watchdogs to kind of
replaces it the reason for ditching it
is because there's a huge game engine
issue we're at about 165 to 187 FPF
seems to be the magic number
it is massive stuttering so as we
approach these higher skew CPUs you see
stuttering and performance metrics that
don't look at all representative of the
hierarchy for the CPUs the pricing or
the performance
normally that's all explained in the
previous video where I worked with
Patrick Latham who worked on this
benchmarking to talk about the GTA 5
issues if you're curious you can learn
more there but that's been removed from
the benchmark because of that issue and
because of the natural need to limit to
1080p and things like that to create a
CG bottleneck
so while 60 replaces it and this helps
us set forth the expectations from you
all as to how the game should be
performing in the future next content
coming up we're getting the AMD CPUs
reacted to the bench including FX 83-70
which is here now the FX 6300 is on the
to-do list and we'll be adding the KB
like Pentiums pretty soon as well
because I know everyone's interested in
those and again
Rison yes I know we all want the
