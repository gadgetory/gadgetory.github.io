case market the cases of power and
cooling manufacturer has somewhat of a
boutique shop feel some of the cases
like the old SG 08 and of course the
rave and RB 02 and we've liked some
other cases well have in the past but
they've had some fierce competition in
the US and global markets and of course
Corsair and cooler master among the top
two competitors with NZXT kind of
dominating parts of the US market right
now including parts where this case is
competing and this is what we're looking
at today in the past we've really liked
Silverstone's raven RV 02 which was the
first rotated motherboard case that we
tested later testing the 600 see by
course there and that also had an
inverted motherboard layout and now
we're looking at something where
standards this is a mid tower ATX case
that retails for about seventy dollars
for the windowed version but there's a
quiet version available also and this is
called the silverstone kublai KL 05 @ BW
so it's got the most friendly name
possible as always check the article
link to the description below for the
full tear down on case internals build
quality and thermals and methodology but
we're going to go through most of that
here at at least a top level the KL 05
is targeted at mid-range PC builds with
an entry to mid-level budget for the
case cooling has long been a strong
point for silverstone cases we've
reviewed anyway and the company's kept a
function over form attitude toward
cooling and thermal design although the
KL 05 still boasts expansive support for
various cooling solutions the case
itself ships relatively bare-bones it
has a single 120 millimeter front intake
fan and that's with the windowed version
of the case Silverstone also takes the
approach that any tower cooler will
sufficiently exhaust its heat through
the rear ventilation without a
pre-installed 120 millimeter rear
exhaust fan similarly anyone buying a
radiator can use the ample Headroom to
install their cooling solution and won't
need pre-installed fans since any
consumer grade CLC includes its own fans
so the single 120 millimeter front
intake solution does kind of make sense
as long as you're putting in either a
good tower cooler or a radiator for your
CPU cooling that makes the chaos 05 an
interesting enclosure since it's so
simplified and cooling design it lowers
costs it's about seventy dollars on
newegg but we ran it through the thermal
bench as we always do and even tested a
few alternative cooling solutions within
the case and
such tests we install the bottom intake
fan in another we remove the hard drive
cages which are modular to see if air
flow would perceptibly improve to the
GPU and then we also did that with a
bottom intake fan installed our test
methodology is entirely defined within
the article link to the description
below let's run through the thermals
before digging into the build quality
ease of installation and cable
management CPU thermals before the
Silverstone kale 05 BW landed at 41.7 c
delta t load one of these stock
configuration making it cooler than the
fantex p400 the rows well gun near and
marginally cooler than the s3 40 but not
quite as low as the 600 see which is
still at the top of the bench here's
where it gets a little more interesting
removing the hard drive cages it drops
the thermals to 40.8 celsius so just
under one celsius difference and that
make it a worthwhile endeavor if you
legitimately had no use for the cages if
you're running an SSD only adding a rear
exhaust fan something that seems obvious
in a stock configuration choice actually
does little to impact cooling compared
to the marginal added investment and
drops thermals to 40.3 celsius or 40
point for 3 celsius from 41.7 celsius
which isn't much of a gain for the extra
fan costs so it makes sense that
silverstone tested and opted out of that
setup for the stock configuration moving
that fan to the bottom intake port sees
a reduction to 40 point 40 Celsius
effectively as Sam as rear exhaust but
that's all for the CPU cooler and doing
things with GPU thermals actually
impacts it a bit more the KL 05 stock
configuration runs the GP pretty warm at
59.5 celsius behind every other case on
the bench but adding a rear exhaust fan
doesn't really do much to help either so
again it makes sense that Silverstone
did opt out of that rear exhaust fan
which so many cases do tend to include a
bottom intake fan as we've traditionally
found to be the case changes everything
for the GPU and suddenly GPU
temperatures drop to 52 is celsius from
59.5 celsius major difference and that
marks the KL 05 as the best performer on
the bench for GPU thermals if it weren't
for the hard drive cage would suggest
this as the stock configuration but
adding a 120-millimeter bottom fan does
require removal of the cages and limits
the PSU space so the actual usability of
this lesion is pretty limited and you
basically running an SSD only the next
best trade-off and it is a good
one is to remove obstructing cages to
improve thermals 250 3.98 Celsius again
a large gain over the 59 Celsius
temperature of the stock configuration
so if you can act even one of the hard
drive cages you'd be in a pretty good
spot for GPU thermal temperature is
overall aren't particularly exciting but
they're not offensive GPU thermals can
certainly improve with some minor
changes by the user and if we were just
suggest one change it would be that
anyone running an SSD only configuration
immediately remove unused hard drive
cages because it will actually improve
GP breathability in noticeable ways /
Silverstone cooling performance is a
little bit of let down compared to the
previous products that we've looked at
from them including the Raven series
cases but the efficiency of
Silverstone's single fan cooling
solution is impressive if dragging a bit
behind some of the immediate competition
thermals aren't everything and with how
similar cases are in this particular
part of the market these days it's
really important for build quality ease
of installation and cable management
features to be at their top class for
every product because between things
like the ends ases 340 the corsair 400
see both of those cases flank this case
in price and then of course there's
other competitors like the rosewill gun
near which we weren't big fans of but
did just come out and is price the same
as this case so it's a fearsome market
and having those build quality and the
ease of installation sort of features at
the top of the specs list are very
important to building a product that's
worth considering since there's just so
much saturation in the 70s dollar case
market the exterior of the case is
relatively inoffensive and plain but
it's got discrete stylization on the
front panel Silverstone uses thick
plastics for the front and top panels
then the usual steel for side panels the
paint is consistently colored across all
materials which is kind of a rare thin
in these 70 daughter cases and it's also
got an easily removable front dust
filter that allows for quick cleaning of
the front intake and also an easily
accessible dust filter for the bottom
and other relevant places the top panel
is one of the pieces that I'm most
interested in with this case so it can
fit to 40 and to 80 millimeter radiators
in that top mounting position and
radiators can be readily mounted above
the chassis and within that large top
panel allowing for cleaner build and
isolated cooling at apart that I have to
reiterate here is that
panel is very easily removed and that's
one of my favorite aspects of this case
case disassembly is hard to get right
and being able to take parts off without
snapping plastic clips is a win for
Silverstone something that other
companies course are included recently
in NZXT in the past can't always pull
off correctly internally a stack of hard
drive cages sits atop the bottom intake
port removing the cages would also allow
for installation of a bottom intake fan
for of course better GPU cool and as we
showed just a moment ago cabling is
difficult to hide in the case and this
is the first case without a shroud that
we've reviewed in quite a while so we're
not really used to showing the exposed
cables from the PSU but that's not a bad
thing not every case needs a PSU shroud
and frankly a lot of them execute the
shrouds really poorly look at the rose
well gun deer for that the lack of a PSU
shroud in the klo 5 allows for more
traditional hard drive support optical
drive support and reduced costs overall
keeping the case more evenly priced in
the Saudi dollar bracket but solarstone
could have done a much better job with
the kala management there needs to be a
cutout for example above the PSU for
access to the FPC USB and audio front
panel headers instead what we have is a
forest pass through with the larger
tables which positions the front panel
connectors farther away from their
destination on the motherboard and that
coupled with Silverstone's use of
traditionally coloured front panel
cables the coloured cables rather than
the blackout cables means that front
panel connectors are plainly visible and
pretty ugly the pastures for the 24 pin
header are aligned well though and
reasonably wide and the EPS pass-through
is also wide enough to accommodate most
motherboard EPS 12 volt positions
everything else is fairly standard the
build materials are sturdy and good the
modular hard drive cages allow for some
level of cooling versus storage
customization and the optical drive
cages exist if you really wanted them
the panel construction is really one of
the best features of the case especially
this top panel where it's deep enough to
fit basically all radiators except for
maybe some of those antec kuhler ones
with the pump mounted to the radiator
and it's also got the rails solution so
you can just screw it in unscrew it and
then shift as needed so there's no
snapping of plastic alligator clips as
we see on a lot of other cases so that's
a big thing I like here it's a few more
screws to access but it's just more
sturdy
and if you're lifting it up by the top
panel it's not going to fly off on you
so these are things that other case
manufacturers should really look into
and then in terms of cooling clean
performances okay it's not exciting but
if you remove those hard drive cages the
GPU performance improves so
substantially even just from removing
the top cages that it's actually one of
the best cases on the bench and the best
case on the bench in some scenarios so
if you only need a few hard drives maybe
three hard drives because three per cage
you could just get rid of that top drive
cage and then use only the bottom one
and that would really substantially
improve your thermals in the seventy
dollar price range the kale 05 offers a
well-constructed minimalistic alee
cooled enclosure to do battle with a sea
of smaller cases with psu shrouds and
those are kind of getting born in some
ways the kale 05 has more traditional
drive support large radiator support a
well-built paneling system and values
build quality over some of the aesthetic
items like better KO management or
better windowing on the side panel now
it's just up to Silverstone to start
finding better names than the likes of
KL 05 be w KL 0 5bq RBZ 02 and things
like that but otherwise we like this
case reasonably we would strongly
suggest looking into things like the
antique CS through 40 the fan tax p400
and the Corsair 400 °c for cases within
the 30 dollar range of this one but
otherwise it's really not a bad case if
you like the look of it as always if you
