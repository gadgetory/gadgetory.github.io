case market the cases of power and
cooling manufacturer has somewhat of a
boutique shop feel some of the cases
like the old SGO 8 and of course the
Raven RB 0-2 and we've liked some other
cases well have in the past but they've
had some fierce competition in the US
and global markets and of course Corsair
and coolermaster among the top two
competitors with NZXT kind of dominating
parts of the US market right now
including parts where this case is
competing and this is what we're looking
at today in the past we've really liked
Silverstone's raven our v02 which was
the first rotated motherboard case that
we tested later testing these 600c by
corsair and that also had an inverted
motherboard layout and now we're looking
at something where standards this is a
mid tower ATX case that retails for
about $70 for the windowed version but
there's a quiet version available also
and this is called the silverstone coop
like al 0 5 BW so it's got the most
friendly name possible as always check
the article link to the description
below for the full teardown on case
internals build quality and thermals and
methodology but we're gonna go through
most of that here at at least a top
level the KL 0-5 is targeted at
mid-range PC builds with an entry to
mid-level budget for the case cooling
has long been a strong point for
Silverstone cases we've reviewed anyway
and the company has kept a function over
form attitude toward cooling and thermal
design although the KL 0-5 still boasts
expansive support for various cooling
solutions the case itself ships
relatively bare-bones it has a single
120 millimeter front intake fan and
that's with the windowed version of the
case silverstone also takes the approach
that any tower cooler will sufficiently
exhaust its heat through the rear
ventilation without a pre-installed 120
millimeter rear exhaust fan similarly
anyone buying a radiator can use the
ample Headroom to install their cooling
solution and won't need pre-installed
fans since any consumer grade CLC
includes its own fans so the single 120
millimeter front intake solution does
kind of make sense as long as you're
putting in either a good tower cooler or
a radiator for your CPU cooling that
makes the chaos 0 5 an interesting
enclosure since its start simplified and
cooling design it lowers cost it's about
$70 on Newegg but we ran it through the
thermal bench as we always do and even
tested a few alternative cooling
solutions within the
in one such test we installed the bottom
intake fan in another we removed the
hard drive cages which are modular to
see if air flow would perceptibly
improve to the GPU and then we also did
that with a bottom and take fan
installed our test methodology is
entirely defined within the article
linked in the description below let's
run through the thermals before digging
into the build quality ease of
installation and cable management's CPU
thermals before the silverstone Cale
zero 5 BW landed at 40 1.7 C delta T
load one of these stock configuration
making it cooler than the fantex P 400
if the Rosewell gun near and marginally
cooler than the s3 40 but not quite as
low as the 600 C which is still at the
top of the bench here's where it gets a
little more interesting removing the
hard drive cages it drops the thermals
to 40 point 8 Celsius so just under 1
Celsius difference and that make it a
worthwhile endeavor if you legitimately
had no use for the cages if you're
running an SSD only adding the rear
exhaust fan something that seems obvious
in a stock configuration choice actually
does little to impact cooling compared
to the marginal added investment and
drops thermals to 40 point 3 Celsius or
40 point 4 3 Celsius from 41.7 Celsius
which isn't much of a gain for the extra
fan cost so it makes sense that
silverstone tested and opted out of that
setup for the stock configuration moving
that fan to the bottom intake port sees
a reduction to 40 point 4 0 Celsius
effectively the same as rear exhaust but
that's all for the CPU cooler and doing
things with GPU thermals actually
impacts it a bit more the KL 0 5 stock
configuration runs the GPU pretty warm
at 59 point 5 Celsius behind every other
case on the bench but adding a rear
exhaust fan doesn't really do much to
help either so again it makes sense that
silverstone did opt out of that rear
exhaust fan which so many cases do tend
to include a bottom intake fan as we've
traditionally found to be the case
changes everything for the GPU and
suddenly GPU temperatures drop to 52 is
Celsius from 59 point 5 Celsius major
difference and that marks the KL 0 5 as
the best performer on the bench for GPU
thermals if it weren't for the hard
drive cage we'd suggest this as the
stock configuration but adding a 121
litre bottom fan does require removal of
the cages and limits the PSU space or
the actual usability of this solution is
pretty limited any basically running an
SSD only the next best trade off and it
is a good
is to remove obstructing cages to
improve thermals to 53.9 eight Celsius
again a large gain over the fifty nine
Celsius temperature of the stock
configuration so if you can act even one
of the harddrive cages you'd be in a
pretty good spot for GPU thermal
temperature is overall aren't
particularly exciting but they're not
offensive GPU thermals can certainly
improve with some minor changes by the
user and if we were just suggest one
change it would be that anyone running
an SSD only configuration immediately
remove unused hard drive cages because
it will actually improve GPU
breathability in noticeable ways for
Silverstone cooling performance is a
little bit of let down compared to the
previous products that we've looked at
from them including the Raven series
cases but the efficiency of
Silverstone's single fan cooling
solution is impressive if dragging a bit
behind some of the immediate competition
thermals aren't everything and with how
similar cases are in this particular
part of the market these days it's
really important for build quality ease
of installation and cable management
features to be at their top class for
every product because between things
like the NZXT s340 the corsair 400 see
both of those cases flank this case in
price and then of course there's other
competitors like the Rosewell gun near
which we weren't big fans of but did
just come out and his price the same as
this case so it's a fearsome market and
having those build quality and the ease
of installation sort of features at the
top of the specs list are very important
to building a product that's worth
considering since there's just so much
saturation in the 70th dollar case
market the exterior of the case is
relatively inoffensive and plain but
it's got discreet stylisation on the
front panel silverstone uses thick
plastics for the front and top panels
then the usual steel for side panels the
paint is consistently coloured across
all materials which is kind of a rare
thing in these $70 cases and it's also
got an easily removable front dust
filter that allows for quick cleaning of
the front intake and also an easily
accessible dust filter for the bottom
and other relevant places the top panel
is one of the pieces that I'm most
interested in with this case so it can
fit to 40 and 280 millimeter radiators
in that top mounting position and
radiators can be readily mounted above
the chassis and within that large top
panel allowing for cleaner build
and isolated cooling at a part that I
have to reiterate here is that the top
panel is very easily removed and that's
one of my favorite aspects of this case
case disassembly is hard to get right
and being able to take parts off without
snapping plastic clips is a win for
Silverstone something that other
companies of course are included
recently in NZXT in the past can't
always pull off correctly internally a
stack of hard drive cages sits atop the
bottom intake port removing the cages
would also allow for installation of a
bottom intake then for of course better
GPU cool and as we showed just a moment
ago cabling is difficult to hide in the
case and this is the first case without
a shroud that we've reviewed in quite a
while so we're not really used to
showing the exposed cables from the PSU
but that's not a bad thing not every
case needs a PSU shroud and frankly a
lot of them execute the shrouds really
poorly look at the rows well gun-deer
for that the lack of a PSU shroud in the
klo v allows for more traditional
harddrive support optical drive support
and reduced cost overall keeping the
case more evenly priced in the saudi
dollar bracket but silverstone could
have done a much better job with the
cable management there needs to be a
cutout for example above the PSU for
access to the FPC USB and audio front
panel headers instead what we have is a
forced pass through with the larger
cables which positions the front panel
connectors farther away from their
destination on the motherboard and that
coupled with Silverstone's use of
traditionally colored front panel cables
the colored cables rather than the
blackout cables means that front panel
connectors are plainly visible and
pretty ugly the pastor's for the 24 pin
header are aligned well though and
reasonably wide and the EPS pass-through
is also wide enough to accommodate most
motherboard EPS 12-volt positions
everything else is fairly standard the
build materials are sturdy and good the
modular hard drive cages allow for some
level of cooling versus storage
customization and the optical drive
cages exist if you really wanted them
the panel construction is really one of
the best features of the case especially
this top panel where it's deep enough to
fit basically all radiators except for
maybe some of those Antec cooler ones
with the pump mounted to the radiator
and it's also got the rails solution so
you can just screw it in unscrew it and
then shift as needed so there's no
snapping of plastic alligator clips as
we see on a lot of other cases so that's
a big thing I like here
it's a few more screws to access but
it's just more sturdy and if you're
lifting it up by the top panel it's not
going to fly off on you so these are
things that other case manufacturers
should really look into and then in
terms of cooling clean performance is
okay it's not exciting but if you remove
those hard drive cages the GPU
performance improves so substantially
even just from removing the top cages
that it's actually one of the best cases
on the bench and the best case on the
bench in some scenarios so if you only
need a few hard drives maybe three hard
drives because three per cage you could
just get rid of that top drive cage and
then use only the bottom one and that
would really substantially improve your
thermals and the $70 price range the
Cale zero five offers a well constructed
minimalistic elite cooled enclosure to
do battle with a sea of smaller cases
with psuche routes and those are kind of
getting boring in some ways the ko0 five
has more traditional drive support large
radiator support a well-built paneling
system and values build quality over
some of the aesthetic items like better
ko Management or better windowing on the
side panel now it's just up to
silverstone to start finding better
names than the likes of k l0 v BW k l0 v
BQ r VZ 0-2 and things like that but
otherwise we like this case reasonably
we would strongly suggest looking into
things like the NZXT s340 the fan tax P
400 and the Corsair 400 C for cases
within the $30.00 range of this one but
otherwise it's really not a bad case if
you like the look of it as always if you
