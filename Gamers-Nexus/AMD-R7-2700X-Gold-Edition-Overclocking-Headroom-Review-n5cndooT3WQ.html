couple of weeks personally signing all
of the 2,700 ex gold additions by which
I mean probably probably signed once
scanned it and then well it's it's been
laser etched on there but we have the
2700 ex gold edition today we're sort of
reviewing it this is the same as the
2700 ex for the most part so if you want
to know how the 2700 extra performs in
any any regard check that review but we
were looking at some basics with this
frequency just making sure it's not any
different and then most importantly
seeing if there's any additional
overclocking head room because Intel and
it's 80 80 60 K has somewhat trained all
of us to hope that anniversary edition
special CP is are specially Bend as well
so that's what we're looking at with
this $330 version of the 2700 ex before
that this video is brought to you by
MSI's r-tx 2070 gaming z8 gigabyte card
the RT x 2070 gaming z uses MSI's dual
fan design with large blades which we've
previously tested to have them on the
best noise normalised thermal results in
the class MSI is 2070 gaming Z has a fat
heatsink furthering the focus on reduced
noise levels by allowing the fans to
spend slower RGB LEDs naturally are
abundant on the card but can be blacked
out to match the carbon and blackout
shroud
learn more at the link in the
description below so really basic stuff
here
it's a 2700 X it has the same specs as a
2700 X the frequency is the same but
we're gonna prove it just really briefly
and a frequency comparison and with
three benchmarks just to kind of blow
through it quickly and other than that
there's really no difference the IHS is
etched a little differently so it's got
the a.m. the 50 logo on it so just AMD
it has a Lisa su laser etched signature
which isn't isn't quite as exciting as a
real signature but at the same time a
real signature would get rubbed off as
soon as you put rubbing alcohol on this
to clean the thrown face though anyway
so beyond that you get a cooler that
you're probably going to replace and a
gold box and as far as Gold Edition
looking into this further gold
we think is the the material for a 50th
anniversary so that that would be kind
of clever except the actual 50th
anniversary Gold Edition naming on this
is more to coincide with the division to
Gold Edition so it's a little bit less
prestigious in that regard but you do
get a few things with this in addition
to the laser-etched commemorative
signature separately we've noticed some
really small differences between our
original pre-production sample which has
had its identification laser etched off
because we got it elsewhere and this one
and that's mostly that the text is a
little larger and bolder on the new one
but that should match all the retail
samples so basically they took some
existing IP addresses and added a bit to
it but beyond that let's talk about the
frequency the game performance and then
most importantly the overclocking
Headroom Andy doesn't claim a frequency
difference so there's no reason to
expect one but we still want to
definitively demonstrate the lack or
existence I have a frequency change in
stock operation will start with
frequency validation to show how all
core behaves on the stock 2700 X and the
Gold Edition 2700 X in total war
Warhammer two's battle test we observed
load frequency at about 40 66 megahertz
all core on the 2,700 x stock cpu which
is shown here with single threads under
low load boosting to about 43 40
megahertz max although that was not all
core and as xfr
always works it's short-lived the 2700 x
gold cpu did almost exactly the same
thing variants in this chart comes into
play marginally but the end result is
always within 10 to 20 megahertz all
core at all times depending on the load
level of the application so in short
there's no difference in the frequency
last there be any concerns or doubts
about the 2700 x gold's stock
performance here's a quick result
listing for our in-house blender
benchmarks with the GN logo ray traced
render we observed a time requirement of
28 minutes stock and 28.3 minutes with
the gold edition which is well within
our error margins here these two are the
same unsurprisingly just for additional
proof the GN monkeyhead renderer also
puts the 2700 X and the 50th anniversary
edition within zero
one minutes of each other or six seconds
so it's the same result on each CPU GTA
5 at 1080p also produced identical
results at 90 FPS average for the 2700 X
original and gold edition CPUs the very
NCC between them are with it's within
margin of error once again it's tenths
of places in performance for average fps
and the one percent and 0.1% lows are
also within error margin so no
difference between these two
unsurprisingly a total war warhammer
twos battle benchmark also puts us
within margin of error again seeing as
they're literally the same processor
under the IHS the 2700 X stock runs at
139 FPS average with the Gold Edition at
141 FPS average we are within error
tolerance for this particular game the
lows are also within margin of error so
no change once again overclocking is the
real question here when Intel did its
8086 K CPUs we remarked that they really
weren't worth buying unless you wanted a
semi guaranteed overclocked adder above
five to five point one gigahertz with a
normal 8700 K chances were that you were
probably within 100 megahertz of the 80s
86 KB between 4.9 and 5.1 maybe 5.2 so
the cost difference was tough to justify
for an extra sort of guaranteed 100
megahertz boost in your overclock
potential it's even harder to justify
here because Rison is already largely
maxed out on frequency out of the box
overclocking has a sort of dangerous
territory we're settling on too low of
an all core OSI will result in worse
performance in some applications
especially those that are using fewer
threads than all of them
this is because XFR and boost can hit
4.2 gigahertz and above as we saw
earlier depending on the load of the
application it won't be out all cores
but an all-court OC will cut off the top
end of that range if you're not careful
we were disappointed in our 2,700 X Gold
Edition sample to say the least it was
Gold Edition but not a gold sample far
from it the hope was that it be really
good but it's just not
we couldn't maintain 4.2 gigahertz even
at one point for one to five volts and
going beyond this would require children
or a bigger loop that
280 millimeter CLC allowed for our 2,700
9x actually performs better than the
2700 X Gold Edition sample that we
bought hitting 4.2 gigahertz at one
point four volts with stability in
blender even which is one of the harder
tests to pass for overclocked stability
after the disappointment of the worst
overclocking Headroom than a product
that's $220 the 2700 9x the Gold Edition
by the way being 332 the hush so quite a
disappointment we decided to under volt
instead so the hope was okay well we
thought we might have a Content piece
here if we could do like 4.3 or
something that would be excellent or
even 4.2 at like 1.38
that would be pretty exciting as well
but but but not even 4.2 at one point
401 volts it's just it's sad and it's
basically I mean it's akin to losing the
silicon lottery on any other 2700 X CPU
except this one he paid more money for
but yeah so after that we did try under
vaulting this table will kind of briefly
show those results we eventually found
the CPU to be stable at about one point
two four volts 4.1 gigahertz all core
although at this point you may be better
off sacrificing all core for stock
frequencies instead so you can hit XF
are the only real benefit of 4.1
gigahertz all core is if your workload
is always all core like blender either
way both CPUs settle around the same
place the other 2700 X we have was 4.1
gigahertz and about 1.25 volts so yeah
we honestly it would be better off we
left the frequency to auto and then
under bolted it as much as we could
there but either way it's it's this
one's not different than that one so
it's an effort in futility so yeah for
what it's worth the r7 2,700 X Gold
Edition does come with some small
bonuses so clearly this is a
commemorative product it's not really
being marketed as a performance thing
which we will credit AMD with that
stance because it's not like Andy went
out there and said this is specially
Bend they didn't go out there and say
this will hit higher frequencies so that
was just us kind of projecting our
oops onto them that spending more money
would result in a better product but
actually what it results in is you get
the laser etched signature which is just
like again it's not a real signature
it's not like she actually sat down and
signed it and then you get World War Z
or the division to Gold Edition Bundle
which is what we think this is probably
named after in reality it also has a
year 1 season pass to the division 2 and
that's that's really about it so it's
the same thing where we were talking
about the 8086 ok it's like there's kind
of there's one main reason to buy
something like this which is you're a
massive AMD fan or well that's probably
the main one is you just you have been a
supporter of a new products or maybe
you've been in the industry for a long
time you've been building pcs for longer
than we've existed as a company for
example and you want something to
commemorate your own milestones and with
like the 8086 k as an example it was
obviously a call back to the 8086 so we
could see the argument that people might
just want something like that because of
personal reasons or just because it's
kind of interesting and neat
historically even if Intel didn't make
hundreds of thousands of them and it
wasn't really that limited but the 8086
K at least would clock a bit higher
basically across the board and and that
was the main draw of it is you spend
more money and you're hoping that based
on the sampling we saw out there in the
wild you're hoping that your sample will
also more or less have 100 megahertz
Plus over the 8700 K original CPU and
that's that's what you're paying the
money for but in this case you don't get
that you're just I mean it's worse than
our 2700 that's sad it's for us I mean
it's not like a comment on AMD it's just
sad for us as for comments on AMD it
comes back to the same thing as always
which is that these rise in CPUs are
pushed so damn far already
that overclocking is just not quite as
exciting in terms of a raw frequency
higher number better game
because it's already there you can't
really get them that much higher the
Nanak CPUs there's far more room to play
because they're not clocked as high out
of the box so 2,700 we've always
recommended over the ax for the 2600
over the X because you're probably going
to be able to hit the same frequencies
with minimal effort and you might even
be able to go beyond like our 2,700 at
4.2 gigahertz for example on average
outperforming at 2,700 X in most all
core use in all quarries cases and
that's a cheaper processor so it's
nothing has changed and these processors
are at the limit already and you know if
you're buying this your I guess the
point of the few benchmarks we showed
was to say that don't buy this for
performance because that's not what
you're getting by it if you're
acknowledging to yourself that I'm
spending extra money on something that
frankly has no functional add unless you
really want those games and you weren't
gonna you would buy them anyway so if
you buy it
admitting that to yourself it's fine
just like any other product but if you
buy it hoping that there's better
overclocking Headroom sample size of one
side our understanding is that there
shouldn't be any on average so don't
expect that but maybe someone else will
get a better one let us know if you see
someone get a higher overclock something
that's not actually disappointing
otherwise maybe we'll put it under the
crew nitrogen or something like that
