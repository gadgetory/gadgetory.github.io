everything just works I was being
sarcastic
a Swiss Army knife and it hopefully has
it says screwdriver in it hopefully has
extra fiber in it
for this
this video is brought to you by us and
the disappointment PC t-shirt a great
way to support gamers Nexus n to
commemorate a year of despair as to wear
a constant reminder of your
disappointment the GN disappointment
t-shirt features release dates for major
milestones like spectra and meltdown the
cts labs report and RAM prices
accompanied by an artefact of design
that matches the infamous XD failure
mode on new video cards
the shirts are high-quality fabrics and
prints and are available in soft 100%
cotton for a comfortable fit or
available in a popular try blood visit
store gamers nexus net or click the link
below to grab one now starting at $19.99
it's not just the worst parts of the
year anywhere you may have seen our
disappointment PC build last year the
2017 that was the first one and now it's
gonna be a regular thing because part of
the stuff we deal with on a daily basis
is in fact disappointing and that's okay
there's a lot of really positive stuff
from this year to and we've talked about
that for example in our best case is
2018 best CPUs 2018 stuff like that
there's plenty of good stuff but it's
also fun to reflect on just some of the
the most either out there or just
totally bad products and events of the
year and look back on it now that we're
at the end of 2018 and see what we might
have in store for 2019 get some
perspective as for the script for this
one I barely need a script because as
you saw on our new shirt in the ad which
is on the store on store 2 Kieran's exit
now if you don't pick it up we have a
timeline almost in concert tour style of
all of the Hijaz the most disappointing
aspects of 2018 the computer hardware
world and so I mean some of those here
spectre and meltdown that was a pretty
big one cryptocurrency mining was big
Final Fantasy 15 s benchmarks were big
all of that stuff but the most important
thing here is the PC that you saw in the
intro this PC is a collection of the
most downer moments that we could muster
into a single build this is our actual
disappointment build or well it was but
we had to send the case back because it
was that disappointing but we still
tested the build as is the most
disappointed parts of the year are all
in this system there are some
unfortunate casualty is like Corsair of
course there didn't do anything wrong
here
we did have to use a cooler of some kind
and we didn't have any particularly
upsetting 20:18 coolers and we didn't
want to unnecessarily stifle the 99 80
XE beyond what it already does to itself
so each one hundred I notwithstanding
the rest of these things pretty
disappointing and we'll walk through the
rest of those parts today as for
everything leading up to this final
ensemble of disappointment let's do a
rewind of bad phrasing let's look back
at what we dealt with so in January we
learned about Spector and meltdown which
I've proliferated into more variants
since then
Spector and meltdown had such an impact
on the industry that Intel's at latest
10 nanometer announcements that they
disclosed just recently specifically
noted in Silicon Harbor mitigations for
those vulnerabilities showing that there
is some dictation of aspects of CPU
design based upon this single event of
spectra and meltdown being unveiled and
for Intel that was a bit earlier than
the rest of us cryptocurrency mining
also blew up big this year regardless of
your views on mining or cryptocurrencies
in general it remains true for several
months that new GPUs were difficult to
find particularly at reasonable prices
and knew their meaning not used we blew
the lid open on Final Fantasy 15 s
benchmark after that and we saw
innumerable flaws in the February launch
of the benchmark including a lack of
object choline and LOD scaling for hair
works elements that heavily affected
results these are things that were being
rendered miles away that we confirmed
with render doc Ansel and other tools
but that soon was outdone by the vacuum
adds we'll just blow past that one GPP
came after that CTS labs their report
you should check that video out that we
did if you didn't see it the GT 1030
ddr4 launch Ram price is going up and
then the silent death of Z 490 at
Computex there was also and that was an
AMD part by the way there's also a 28
core CPU under a chiller and that
doesn't need a reminder and of course
the launch of our TX a lot happened this
year and we decided to combine some of
those most noteworthy elements would
into a single PC which has since
vaporized because it exceeded the amount
of the maximum atomic density of
disappointment in one square area so
we're left with these two parts which is
the 92 XE and
2080 not the TI specifically with the
case having gone back because that whole
system is being replaced already funded
depending so for the system the most
critical things here to talk about the
r-tx 2080
we deemed more disappointing than the
2080 ti the 2080 ti actually performance
wise it does its job it's the new best
so it's always hard to argue against the
best because even with the prices it's
still the best so it's got some high
ground there that can hold the 2080
though it launched and it just it was it
was disappointing plain and simple it
lacked any significant improvement over
the 1080 TI and yet the price was almost
always higher at launch and that's
changed now that the 1080 TI is more or
less impossible to purchase but it was
one of the bigger let downs of the year
the CPU is an Intel I 999 ATX II and we
chose that because it barely did
anything over the existing 79 80 XE in
fact it was barely deserving of a review
that's how little chains on this high
end part so for enthusiasts the 99 80 XE
is worse than the 79 80 XE because if
you can deal it you can do liquid metal
or something like that it's just better
to buy the 79 80 XE and go that route as
for the case the case was Walmart's
now-famous overpowered PC case the dtw
enclosure which there's a lot of content
on that we did a full review of the case
on its own we'll recap some of that here
but the biggest thing is that it's got a
total of 4 millimeters of space
thereabouts between the front panel and
the chassis thereby choking the entire
PC into oblivion so that was
disappointing as well and we'll talk
about each of these elements
individually but let's start with the RT
X 2080 it is definitely the most iconic
launch of at least the second half if
not the entire year because there's been
nothing
NVIDIA has been riding on Pascal for a
long time they've done really well to
optimize it but everyone was waiting for
this launch and we ended up with well
you know what we ended up with at this
point the RT X 2080 was just a week
launch from Nvidia that's all there was
to it
CEO Jensen Haun seemed off in his
presentation struggling to convey why
ray-tracing is important and often
default into simple phrases like it just
works or it's beautiful to the extent
that there is a compilation on YouTube
of him saying everything just works
everything just works everything just
works everything just works computer
graphics basically works
and yet for ray-tracing it just works
everything just works global elimination
just works ambient occlusion just works
for ten hours
what NVIDIA has accomplished is a
massive technical feat for sure and
real-time rate racing is absolutely an
admirable goal but you really only get
one shot with consumers before they
write off an entire already existing
technology as quote BS as we've seen in
some of the comments that's sort of
tragic with our TX based on comments
alone a lot of consumers weren't even
aware that rate racing is already a
thing and so now we see regular comments
about how and I'm quoting here rate
racing is a scam end quote
just for reference we use rate racing in
our own intro animation and outro
animation it's used daily in CGI films
Pixar films things like that it's just
that the real-time implementation is key
and Nvidia bashed it to a point to even
tarnish the idea of rate racing that's
how poorly the RDX launch went over and
how poorly their education effort was on
informing the audience of what rate
racing is and what the distinction is
versus real-time at the Nvidia editors
day for RT X there's actually one of the
best technical deep dives that we've had
from a company so and video gets huge
credit they're the architects the power
design team the cooler design team they
all did a good job of talking to the
product to the editors that would be
people like us unfortunately they also
spent a lot of time several hours in
fact two to three hours talking about
these games that would support our TX a
huge amount of this presentation was
predicated on addressing the obvious
concern that Nvidia knew we would all
have in the media of ok cool
RT X's is cool sure but what supports it
what is going to support this thing
because if you have all this tech in
here but on the software side no one
does anything what good is it
and vidi is not a dumb company they knew
that we would all be pressing that angle
and so to address it preemptively and
video cued up I don't know how many
games but it was a lot of them back to
back to back of developers talking about
how r-tx just works how it's great to
work with how it's easy to implement and
how their game will have RTX so don't
worry there will be games that support
r-tx and then 50 days went past past the
launch of the product so you have 50 51
52 days somewhere around there before an
r-tx implementation came to be that's a
problem all the marketing hype is gone
its eradicated and it replaced instead
with skepticism from users who are now
upset that the product is expensive is
not meaningfully except for the TI not
the 2080 not meaningfully outperforming
the old products and the one that does
outperform the oil products is
significantly more expensive so you have
an upset user base and a delayed launch
of a key feature that is literally the
namesake of the product
RTX so that set everyone up for
disappointment
the first title that did support RT acts
as late as it was was battlefield and it
runs barely at 1080p on a 2080 with RT
Exxon and all the other settings pretty
high or maxed sure they've issued a lot
of changes to that one game dice and end
video working alongside each other but
it's that first impression that really
counts Nvidia had its biggest misstep in
years with one of the most important
launches that it could encounter a
misstep on this has been a period where
Andy could not respond making it seem
like a no-lose situation but Nvidia
still managed to lose it took a brand
credibility hit that will haunt it at
its next major technology unveil even if
this doesn't impact the bottom line much
today seen as high-end users still only
really have one option and everyone else
bought 10 80s anyway and that's still
Nvidia it does impact the skepticism and
openness expressed towards Nvidia's
future announcements so this matters
this will have a lasting effect everyone
was ready for new cards it should have
been a clean sweep for Nvidia but they
just botched every
single aspect of the launch except for
again that technical side of the editors
day was it was great but there needs to
be more than that there's a very off
presentation by a normally OnPoint CEO
at Nvidia the presentation alone incited
skepticism largely by doing weird and
sort of shady things but maybe not well
it was probably intentional but they did
things like comparing r-tx effects
against just flat shaded objects without
any of the standard global illumination
or standard lighting effects applied at
all instead of a comparison against
modern graphics tricks because all
computer graphics involves tricking the
user into thinking it's good enough and
video compared instead it's r-tx options
versus no effort flat shaded 3d objects
with no lighting effects with no
traditional game tricks to make that
scene look believable or i mean you can
fake things like caustics you can fake
things like again global illumination
but instead of doing that Nvidia
completely changed the lighting and some
of their side-by-side comparisons added
in large area lights new lights on the
walls defeated the purpose of
illustrating how global illumination
works and ended up with a demonstration
that is basically the equivalent of an
infomercial where you have a desaturated
photograph of someone who's frowning
versus a vibrant photograph of someone
who's happy that's what you're looking
at it is not a fair comparison and we
talked about all this in our initial
review and some post announcement
follow-up materials that you should
definitely check out if you haven't so
we'll stop here before repeating
everything again the point is and video
walked away from its announcement
looking like it didn't even know how its
own technology worked it looked like it
didn't understand what was going on and
you have the CEO up on stage who at a
loss for words defaults to it's
beautiful it just works and the irony of
course was that you end up then with
things like artifacting but that's all
stuff we've talked about so Nvidia walks
away looking looking bad this time
they're limping a bit the launch made
things look even worse it knocked some
of the some of the wind out of the sails
Nvidia otherwise an unstoppable
juggernaut the last few years has been
knocked down a few pegs now and the
factions standing within the community
has taken a hit as a result of
this launched the 99 80 XE up next was
easily among the next most disappointing
parts this year with the 9900 K at least
there was real movement in the product
stack Intel did something meaningful and
different the 99 ad XE however added
solder and boosted stock frequencies but
that was it until did not make any other
changes to the product and ended up
making it worse for enthusiasts as a
result of soldering it ironically enough
so if we're out of the box users those
who never make any changes it's a bit of
an upgrade over the 790 DX e and at the
same price sure it might be better for
those people the trouble is that the
core to core thermal Delta on the 1990
DX e was tremendous as we saw in early
benchmarks that we did and deal it in a
79 AD XE normalized that Delta in ways
that significantly improve overclocking
Headroom with CPU overclocking and these
are advertised strongly as unlocked
parts I'll remind you what CPU overclock
and you're constrained by the hottest
core and running one core 30 degrees
hotter than the coldest set of all the
other cores limits headroom
significantly the 99 ATX II did that
whereas the 790 DX II offers an
enthusiast and easier product to work
with when considering delayed options
you just straight shouldn't deal it in
99 ATX II it's too dangerous even
ignoring all this it was just plain
boring the launch wasn't that exciting
the 9900 K launch definitely was a it's
it's not like what we're expecting from
maybe sunny Cove in terms of excitement
or isolate as you may call it the
collection of everything but the night I
heard Kay was was still a definitive
winner in some performance and most
performance categories just about all of
them but it lost in the pricing segment
when comparing strictly to the most
obvious choice would be something like a
2700 X or maybe low on thread Ripper so
either way 900k it won some it lost some
and it advanced the product portfolio
for Intel in a meaningful way
that was a good launch even though it
was plagued with with just I mean when
did that even happen
plagued with things like principled
technologies benchmarks and other
controversies which that was October 9th
by the way it's on the it's on the shirt
there
but even that notwithstanding these
controversies around the 900k of which
there were many that we reported on the
product itself has a place in the market
the 99 80 XE barely has a place in the
market and really shouldn't exist
because ultimately it's a relaunch of
the same product from one year ago that
has solder added to it and it's like
it's a little bit faster stock so kind
of a letdown there
we were hoping for more but that's the
nature of everything being delayed
hopefully they improve going forward and
then we have Walmart system so the dzw
series we need to beat this into the
ground any further than it already has
been but the point here is to reiterate
something that we haven't had enough
chance to really talk about which is
that Walmart was in a very key and
interesting strategic position to brain
PC gaming hopefully an affordable
competitive price to a market that is
otherwise completely oblivious to what
PC gaming is the target audience for the
dtw systems they don't know who we are
they know they might not know who Linus
tech tips is these are people who who
are probably parents of kids who play
fortnight or pub G or whose friends do
and they want a gaming PC to do the same
that's the target audience and keeping
that target audience in mind you have an
oblivious customer who is going into a
store to hopefully pick up a system to
make someone happy and the system that
Walmart came up with through their
partners which would be East sports
arena and making the brand overpowered
jointly as we understand it in the
system that Walmart came up with is just
bad the prices have dropped considerably
you're welcome but it's still it's still
just it's not a good collection of parts
they're using an 8 through 10
motherboard with like a 1080 and 8700
single single dim per channel memory set
up with the h3 10 motherboard and I
don't know the power supply was probably
the most redeeming part of the build
other than the silicon which Walmart has
no no real and what else are they gonna
put in there
Celeron that would be worse but the
disappointing part about the Walmart
system was strictly that it was an
opportunity to really reach a wider
market as PC gaming has this incredible
advantage of growing right now PC gaming
it kind of it's like a sine wave you get
a bit of a growth in between console
cycles and then you might have a bit of
a dip when the new consoles come out and
right now we're at the peak of that wave
of growth PC gaming is very healthy
especially in the enthusiast space games
again like fortnight and pub G are
helping tremendously to grow the PC
gaming community and this helps all of
us it benefits everyone rising tide
raises all votes as it maybe so while I
just totally botched that is is the
unfortunate part because they had an
opportunity and they did everything
wrong and it's going to turn people away
from PC gaming who otherwise might not
have really thought too hard about
getting into it to begin with you
sometimes you just want to buy something
and use it you don't need to be an
expert on it so that was a bit of a
letdown and then finally we had some aha
some media examples of disappointment
from this year that were in the intro
clip but I will leave the host of the
hair you can watch that again if you
want to pick up on those but yeah that's
that's the that's a disappointment build
so it's been a fun year though we've
really enjoyed working on everything we
worked on this year this video is of
course fun and different for us we'll do
another one but hopefully not till 2020
that's not gonna happen
it's gonna be 2019 we'll do another one
in about a year from now so keep an eye
out for that otherwise keep an eye out
for all of our CES coverage coming up
soon hopefully we'll have some really
interesting and fun stuff to counter all
the disappointing stuff for the year
that you can look forward to and maybe
picking up some some new products after
CES we'll see if anything's good though
so subscribe to the channel if you
haven't already you go to store that
gamers nexus net to pick up our
disappointment tour shirt which I'll
just walk you through it briefly if you
didn't notice there's artifacting
everywhere so that's kind of key and
then we've got the dates and the major
disappointing events and we also have
artifacting on the front with some video
card silhouettes that we made so
is of course the reference to a bit of
everything from the year just kind of
fun you can pick it up on store to
kyndra's XS net and we're not gonna I
don't know we're we're not gonna sell
this one forever because it's labeled
2018 but we've got tri-blend and cotton
up there if you're interested in either
pick it up thank you for watching as
always check out our upcoming content
for hopefully some more uplifting stuff
although hopefully you got a lot from
this one and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
