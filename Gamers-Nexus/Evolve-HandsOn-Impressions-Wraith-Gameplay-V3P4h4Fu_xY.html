nexus dotnet and i'm here to talk about
evolve which is the first person kind of
role based shooter / action MOBA game
asymmetrical multiplayer coming out from
Turtle Rock Studios the developers of
the left 4 dead series so evolved is
actually about two months away from
release and they actually hosted an
event last week in San Francisco where I
got to get my hands on the single-player
experience of the game and actually it
was my first time with the game so I got
to learn some more about it we'll talk a
little bit about what the game's about
and we'll also uncover some of the news
that came out of that event right there
including some notes about the
single-player some notes about Wraith
which is the third monster and at the
end we'll talk a bit about the beta
opportunity that's coming up next month
evolve is an asymmetrical game meaning
one team consists of four while the
other is one so the four consists of
four different roles and they're hunters
super powered up humans that are out to
go hunt a monster and so you'll have
your medic you'll have your support
you'll have your assault and you'll have
your what's the other class oh gosh will
just give you a screenshot right there
there we go that's that's one of the
given teams that we're looking at there
so they're coming up against a monster
and a monster is this beast that resides
on a planet in the far reaches of space
there are a few different modes that the
game is comprised of so there's a hunt
mode which is pretty straightforward the
humans have to kill the monster the
monster has killed humans are the
hunters there's rescue where the hunters
have to protect survivors that the
monster is trying to hunt down and kill
there's a nest mode or when where the
monster has these eggs it has to protect
them the hunters go out and try to
attack those so it's kind of like the
opposite of rescue and then all the
modes come together in what's called
evacuation and evacuation is actually
offered as a single player opportunity
it can be offline and with local
multiplayer opportunity or cooperative
play right there there's a lot that can
be done with the game there
there are over 12 hunters each of which
has you know they're one of four classes
right and there are distinctions in the
gear the loadouts essentially for each
character under that class for the
monsters we have a Goliath which is a
straight pretty much brawling giant we
have a crack in and then most recently
announced was the Wraith will talk a
little bit about the Wraith here so the
Wraith is the assassin monster meaning
it travels at a speed that's faster than
the other monsters can go in for kind of
sneak attacks it has lower health like
the other monsters the Wraith has to
gain armor the way that the Wraith games
gains armor is by feeding on the
wildlife so we're going to go through
some videos here of the rate in action
we'll take a look at some of her
abilities and with gaming gaining armor
you can level up you can evolve and
therefore your abilities can increase
you can choose to increase your armory
generation or your attack damage
cooldown reduction things like that rage
mode which is a supernova attack very
useful for taking out a group of enemies
or enemies that are very close to each
other again she doesn't have she doesn't
do a whole lot of damage in her regular
attacks so it's useful to use supernova
when you have multiple enemies okay now
let's take a look at the abduction
ability this is pretty fun so this is a
good way to isolate an enemy you press
the button for abduction she comes in
grabs that enemy pulls it back to her
initial positioning when you press the
button to engage that ability and then
that way she isolates that enemy and can
attack it wear it down from there this
is really good for something like a
medic where you know that you want to
take out a medic so then that way he or
she can't heal the party if she's dead
now when it comes to the hunters it
doesn't really play out entirely like a
first-person shooter the rules are very
defined in that you're going to have to
balance your different abilities you're
gonna have to use them multiple times in
each battle and although there are cool
downs and whatnot there there's always a
way that you can do something actively
to either pursue and detect or you know
engage the enemy distract the enemy help
other players so all hunters are
equipped
with the cloaking ability the team
cloaking ability and the ability to go
up to wounded players and heal them so
everybody's got that whether your
assault support whatever everybody also
has a jetpack so that's really fun
somebody who likes come the arena
shooter it's really fun that way but
yeah there you don't really end up
shooting a gun too often and if you do
it's actually doing more than just
damaging the enemy it's doing something
else it's powering up another player if
your support you can do things like if
your support you can deploy a decoy
deploy a bot that will go out and try to
detect the enemy evacuation is the
amalgamation of all the multiplayer
modes so it takes place over i think
five days and it kind of has a series of
connected events based on what happens
during your playthrough there are
bonuses at the end of each round to the
to the winning side the way that
evacuation starts is there's always a
hunt at the beginning so the hunt again
is kill the monster or kill all the
hunters if you're the monster and then
from there you choose what the next mode
is so it could be nest it could be
rescue it could be another hunt and then
the last one is a mode where the monster
is trying to destroy these power
generators and it can employ the help of
these minions that hatch from eggs so
yeah there's a lot of variety in
evacuation you don't always play on the
same maps you're not always playing the
same mode so pretty much every time you
play it it's going to be different you
can enjoy it as a single player
experience you can enjoy it offline
let's say your networks down you can
actually enjoy it locally too so that's
really fun to see a couch co-op
experience come to this game one thing
that I found especially playing as the
Wraith because against an assassin class
is kind of more specialized than or and
less straightforward than a brawling
Goliath is that yeah the AI is
definitely difficult I got my butt
handed to me every time I was playing on
evacuation but if you take the time to
learn you know how much cooldown time is
needed you know balancing and
micromanaging the game's many complex
fast it's like armor and feeding how
often should you be getting away from
the enemy when she
you be attacking I mean that's it's a
lot more complex than i expected
initially but it's going to be more fun
and rewarding as a result of that
especially as you get to evolve the
beast and you get to you know power up
mid game and then as a result of your
successes you can unlock more hunters
and you can unlock more monsters
especially as they're released later in
the game right now for the launch evolve
will only have three of the playable
monsters I'll also talk a little bit
about the open beta so next month Turtle
Rock will have an open beta from january
fifteenth through the 19th on xbox live
for xbox one users with xbox gold
subscriptions so starting the 15th I
believe people can play hunt multiplayer
once you actually download it but it is
an open beta for all gold users so you
can access it if you're on line between
those days however ps4 and PC users
aren't left in the dust completely so
for pc and ps4 if you have if you were
invited to the open alpha back in
october then you will be part you will
be invited to a limited test and also
join the test on pc if you have in your
Steam library a copy of either left for
dead or BioShock Infinite playstation 4
users have to be PlayStation Plus
subscribers alright so will obviously
have to check out the beta and see how
evacuation plays out online you know
test that out see how the servers are
running see how the game runs with
frames per second I was playing on PC
here at the event and it ran very
smoothly there were only like one or two
small stutters that I noticed but
otherwise it was a 60 frames per second
experience and so that went really well
gameplay it's going to take playing
through the different hunters and the
different modes multiple times I think
to really understand how balanced this
game is with evacuation mode you can
flip between the different hunters so if
you press down on the d-pad you can
switch from support to medic so on and
so forth so that's really entertaining
as well especially if you know you just
want to you're playing through the beta
and you're playing evacuation yours like
a I want to see what each of these
classes can do I only have so much time
it is fun it's something that we haven't
seen in kind of an arena environmental
on a first-person scale in a while so I
mean you do have team fortress but the
structure that's a little bit different
you know it's symmetrical and you can
have you know multiple people the same
class so anyway we'll have more coverage
on evolve next month be sure to type a
comment below if you have any questions
about the game or want us to reach out
to Turtle Rock Studios stay tuned for
more coverage of evolved here on gamers
