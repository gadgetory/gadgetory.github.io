GTX 1070 unveil events near dreamhack
2016 in Austin Texas and the GTX 1080s
are right here next me an SLI in the
system built by BS mods Bob Stuart rod
Rosenberg building that system the 1080s
have greater than 9 @ teraflops of
computes individually there's two of
them in here there's 8 gigabytes of on
card memory its g5 acts that's microns
at new memory it has been called the
gddr5 X memory it's not gddr5 since 5x
it's got an 8 gigabyte capacity and then
I should operate about 13 to 14 gigabits
per second per die which it's not
officially discussed in the presentation
but we know that micron specs so that's
what you look after that the core clock
boosted in real game performance of the
demo was operating at 20 to 14 megahertz
that's greater than 2 gigahertz
operating speed boosted and it does have
additional overclocking capacity these
cards the 1080 specifically are
available for $600 starting there's a
$700 special and Vidia version and that
has greater overclock and support the
air the cooling is all air cooling it's
a new industrial design and it's got
vapor chambers for the actual cooling
and then there's an oral blower fan for
the active dissipation of the heat in
terms of temperatures in the demo we saw
an active temperature under utilization
of 67 degrees Celsius that was absolute
that was not Delta and that's all we
really know about the cooling right now
as for the gtx 1070 that card is priced
at 380 dollars pretty big hits even on
videos on competition that's due out at
june 10th and the 10 80s are due May
27th so that's all we got for you right
now on the 10 80s and 10 70s brand-new
and video cards on Pascal architecture
if you're curious about this
architecture please check out our deep
dive article and video that we posted
just today or maybe slightly yesterday
dependent when you see this video so
that's all for now
patriotic commercial video if you wanna
help us out directly thank for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
