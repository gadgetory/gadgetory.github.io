of ask GN as always you can leave your
questions in the comment section below
or on the patreon discord in the ask GN
channel on that discord where I comb
through all the questions for each
episode and try and fit as many as
possible in the next one
today we've got some interesting
questions on one one a discussion
opportunity on tech battle scars and
then some questions about use cases for
thread Ripper questions about
overclocking and multipliers questions
about cleaning systems things like that
overclocking monitors as well before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by the EVGA 1080 TI sc2 and
NVIDIA Destiny to bundle running up
through September 4th the 1080i sc2
comes with a synchronous fan control for
its dual fans and nine thermal sensors
and again includes destiny to learn more
at the link in the description below we
had a couple good questions from the
last episode that were more like myths
kind of mythbusters-style things that
won't be going into here but they're
interesting ideas one was does holding
the power button down rather than
clicking shut down still hurt the OS
like the the myth or the legend once was
and those moving the PC while it's in
use hurt the hard drive because you've
got a spinning platter those relocating
it hurt that or misaligned the header
which I guess and in fact it is possible
to cause some kind of header
misalignment and mess up the drive if
you're moving it around while it's in
work but don't really know I just
thought they were interested if anyone
knows about the power button one I'd be
curious though because I haven't looked
into that so the first real question is
this was brought up by I think whiskey
in the discord chat the patreon chat
we're just talking earlier about
overclocking and how he had encountered
an issue where 10th his 1080i was not
overclocking as high as previously and I
mentioned that it might have something
to do with temperatures and I think we
got into a good discussion there where
the result was a higher overclock with a
lower temperature and so it's time to
kind of bring this up once again but in
the past we've briefly mentioned at
least once that pascal is very sensitive
to the GPU core temperature i think we
talked about this with Kane
and previously but every five degrees
can really help you out and what we were
seeing the over clocks in discord chat
were improvements of on the magnitude of
maybe 10 12 megahertz at a time by
dropping clock and I think whiskey's
quick testing was more or less
validating what we've seen previously
which is if you really wanted the
highest overclock you blast the fans
you'll get a couple extra megahertz
maybe 20 extra megahertz with the higher
fan speeds as the GPU approaches 40
Celsius it seems to really do a lot
better in the 30 to 40 C range then
above that and now how appreciable is
that in gaming not a whole lot but if
you're just going for Maddox clocks
Pascal is really sensitive to
temperature so just wanted to point that
out because I don't think we ever really
talked about it a whole lot in our
reviews never spent a day dedicated to
proving that point but it is something
we've seen routinely it's something we
know to be fact basically if you're
wondering why your overclock today might
be lower than they were previously it's
probably more likely because something
happened where your temperatures are
higher maybe you decided that you didn't
need the aggressive fan curve because
temperatures are fine so you lower the
fan speeds and that would potentially be
a cause of the higher temperatures or
the higher clocks rather even if the
temperature is well within operating
range for a 1080i kind of under bring
that up next question that was also GP
related from it's a YouTube submitted
question from bents who says sgn I
chipped the corner my 1050 TI is GP 107
core it still works but how well it just
randomly died on me I swear I saw a
transistor in the in the removed corner
fYI it was the top right corner so I
don't you might have seen something else
probably not a transistor but maybe a
cap or something up there I'd have to
look at that that died and substrate I
haven't looked at it in a while but
there are often tiny caps surrounding
the outside of a CPU or GPU and you
don't need all of them technically
speaking that we were talking about
there Bauer about this at Computex and
how he
as on several occasions accidentally
ripped out like a capacitor or something
like that when trying to deal it
processors and they still work fine you
might not know what functionality lost
or maybe you do and it's just not a big
deal but they can still work without all
those components so it's it's not
instantly dead but if you chipped the
corner I'd have to see a photo and I
would love to see a photo if you get a
chance but it's possible that you only
chip the cover of a die the actual die
is underneath that metal looking sheath
on top the reflective surface it's under
there and it's possible that you just
didn't dig into anything important which
in that case probably don't do what you
did again and count your good luck and
move on but yeah I would say it's you
can remove small parts it's not always
going to kill stuff you don't want to do
that but a lot of the times these parts
are a lot more they will tolerate a lot
more abuse I think than people realize
you can miss handle things quite a lot
and they'll be fine I we work with this
with all these components on a day to
day basis and when it's in a work
environment it gets abused so that's
part of the job that's part of owning
the equipment and that's why we have
redundancy because it's not a one-off
build for us like it is for a actual
consumer personal machine and I can tell
you a firsthand they can take a hell of
a lot of abuse in fact this is where the
tech pals carts discussion comes in so
we were talking with other media at one
of the recent events including Gordon
from PC world and a couple other folks
and talking about different battle scars
of things where like you might remove a
PG a cooler and rip the CPU out with it
or something like that or whatever the
case may be and one of the ones that I
brought up was there was a time when I
forget what I was working on but one of
the CPUs were working with actually bent
like like the CPU was like that and hot
so you're like oh well that's dead oops
but now so I took the CPU the subs
you can physically see it like crooked
and not not bent from like if you bend a
PCB bend the PCB on a video card by over
torquing something not bent like that
dent like legitimately if he pushed it
any further it would snap in half and
the IHS was more or less holding it
together so that part was no longer used
in testing after that but I wanted to
see if I could reclaim it for other
machines that were not using and testing
so I took it to a vise you wrapped a
towel around it took it to a vise and it
kind of slowly bent it back to shape and
it worked as a CB worked fine I think we
didn't even lose any memory channels all
testing validated all testing past
temperatures were fine memory speeds
were fine memory bandwidth was the same
Layton sees were all the same and the
benchmark performance was the same that
CPU is still in use today and one of the
systems I've got and it performs just
like if you ran a 3d mark on it it would
perform the same way it did years ago so
4000 series CPU so I would just go it to
show if they can take a lot of abuse as
long as it you don't hit a
mission-critical area I wouldn't
recommend that you go bend to CPUs
because there's a very good chance that
it does not unbend or that you do in
fact damage something there's all those
layers of PCB there's wiring in each of
those layers Jay's got an old video or
he drills through a motherboard which
we've done too by the way
and depending on how careful you are and
what you know about the trace layout on
the board which is often nothing because
that's not something that's really
published unless you talk to the
manufacturer and try and learn like hey
is this a safe area to drill
generally the answer is no but you can
definitely kill stuff but they can
always take a lot of abuse the board
that I drilled through was because it
was a z97 I think board something like
that and it got it's just it got some
mounting hardware stuck in it it just
wasn't gonna be possible to remove it so
I'd rolled it out and I mean I was
drilling through a saga hole anyway so
there's no risk of damaging any
and it works fine because you just don't
clip the edges don't clip the PCB and
it's fine you're just hopefully just
drilling straight through a hole anyway
other than the screw that's in there
that you want to get out so I kind of
closed but it came out relatively
unscathed it still worked and worked
fine so yeah they think some abuse now
as far as your GPU I would say just be
happy with the luck and probably don't
mess with it again but it sounds like it
just happened to miss something
important
next question from scooby-doo beyond
discord he said your latest video this
is referencing the thread Ripper one the
use cases for thread Ripper one the way
this video talks about use case scenario
you found four thread reproduction
compression in it you mentioned how
Andy's PR department couldn't give you
straight answers about rise ins ideal
use case scenarios due to a lack of
communication with their technical
people because well anyway you point out
that in blender and Adobe Premiere that
CUDA acceleration is faster much faster
in fact making a powerful CPU rather
redundant even including the CUDA render
times with a 7600 K and a graphs prove a
point
now another tech Tube channel I watched
keep saying that his videos don't
include a lot of quote effect and so he
doesn't benefit from CUDA acceleration
as much making a strong case for using a
powerful CPU your videos don't seem to
use a lot of effects either though so
I'm at a loss to know what he's
referring to since I don't render myself
so the question is is there a use case
scenario where rendering with a strong
ZB alone outperforms a weaker one with
futa acceleration is a stronger CPU it
in such an instance redundant or
superfluous so that's a really
complicated question and there are a few
different answers to it Linus has run
into this as well so - did a video years
ago I think either the thumbnail or the
title was something like our $4,000
mistake or something like that he talks
about how they buy or bought hi i'm cpus
for editing machines and found that cuda
was doing the job for them the same as
if they paired it with a $300 CPU that's
changed a little bit since then not a
whole lot premiere has been updated
several times since then CeCe's kind of
a thing
and so there are differences but in our
testing very directly to answer first of
all when I say in our testing I mean
internally for use just kind of gauging
it I ball in it look at performance that
way it's not like we're benchmarking
this stuff for publication so in that
testing what we've seen is that things
like warps so like warp stabilized seems
to be pretty CPU intensive when it's
happening so if you look at the thread
utilization while a warp is being
applied at least in the footage we've
worked with that is a CPU intensive
process and a lower-end CPU will hinder
the speed at which that task completes
so it seems to depend on what you're
doing
warping with what we've done I haven't
seen that warping as CUDA accelerated
I'm not an authority on that topic but
that's what my observation has been so
it seems to be a CPU accelerated task
and so you would benefit from a better
CPU I'm not sure if you can do to
accelerate it maybe you can not
something I've looked into CUDA
acceleration definitely speeds things up
I mean if you look at our charge for the
1080p AVC HD render we do for though the
CPU benchmarks which is an old test at
this point but if you look at those
charts an r5 and i-5 perform the same as
an i-9 and thread Ripper if they're all
cuda accelerated it just it doesn't
matter I mean they're within one to two
minutes of each other on a twenty to
sixty minute render depending on what
you're looking at and that's basically
variance at that point so CUDA seems to
pretty much be the great equalizer in
that test but that's a 1080p AVC HD
video whereas what we do now is 4k and
it's some other codec and that seems to
interact differently in rendering than
what we used to do with the 1080p60 AVC
HD stuff so I know that for sure
upgrading CPUs can't help so we moved
from a 49 60 X 4.4 gigahertz overclocked
I think that's what is that six cores 12
threads or something we moved from that
to the Xeon something from the same
generation x 79 CPU and that's a 12 core
24 thread part from years
lowered clock speed and the render
performance improvement was something
like 10% so clearly there's still a
benefit there that's I mean it's not a
linear gain because you've doubled your
thread count or something like that
you've increased your thread count a lot
and either it's eight it's either eight
and sixteen or six and twelve up to 12
and 24 is a big jump more than 10% but
we're only getting 10% improvement out
of it so there's a game to be had but I
don't know it just depends on what
you're doing like the effects we don't
do a lot of effects as in like green
screens and stuff like that but we do
use all kinds of color correction we
apply warps we work with other various
small things like there are ultra keys
in there for the intro on the outro and
lighting changes in post but I couldn't
tell you if it's more CPU or GPU limited
what I can tell you CB does matter it's
just there's a limit like the GPU in
everything we've done going from
something like a Titan XM to a 1080i or
from a 10 but what's 980ti to a 1080i
those have shown bigger jumps in our
type of rendering than a CPU upgrade but
we still see a CPU upgrade jump so the
point I would make here is I think the
benefit is more than just rendering
because we see the bigger gains and
things like scrubbing playback while a
warp is being applied so if you're
worried about more than just rendering
then you need to consider the editing
scenario to where during editing you
have scrub playback and how quickly the
timeline responds to movement and so if
you were doing a warp that's consuming a
bunch of threads while also trying to
still edit the rest of the video that's
where you want the more powerful CPU to
try and keep up with both of those
things I want because that's starting to
get intensive especially if you're
scrubbing stuff that has other CPU
intensive effects on it I couldn't tell
you what those are I just haven't
figured it out yet but if you're
scrubbing stuff that seems to be more
CPU enzymes of while doing something
else let's see the intense stuff like a
warp then you have trouble so I don't
know it's a lot of a lot of words - more
or less say it depends on what you're
doing but I think that gives you some of
the some of the angles we look at it
next question is from yummy Frank who
says Steve I have a question when you
overclock a cpu what happens with their
boost speed for example if I overclocked
a 1702 3.1 will a boost the 3.8 or only
3.7 what happens to boost speed if you
go over the boost speed with OC when you
start changing the multiplier basically
turns off boosting that's all there is
to it and that's why with Rison or
threader for CPUs if your overclock is
lower than the XFR numbers and so it
might be 4.1 or something and you're
working with an application that only
engages the amount of cores that will be
hit with xfr so 4 on thread Ripper then
you'll actually where's performance but
as long as you exceed xfr and your work
or you're working with applications that
use a lot more cores than xfr can work
on then you'll be advantaged but yeah
basically it's an override once you
start tuning it overrides all that stuff
next question Zeta discord also says
question for Sdn when cleaning your PC
is it bad for the motherboard or the
fast to blow through blow air through
the fans causing them to spin at high
speed well I haven't had this one
because of all the counts that we see
there like be careful with the fans
don't touch those this fragile like
there's some truth to that but also get
what calling back the beginning of this
video they can really take a lot of
abuse these components but that's worth
taking an air compressor or something I
don't know I really like spray and air
compressor at a fan for very long the
bearings probably won't like it but I
don't know I have no problem with taking
a can of compressed air and just kind of
blast it at the corners to get all the
dust out and once the dust has gone just
stop I don't know I don't think that's
really gonna cause any serious damage if
you're doing that everything honestly
like seriously anyone who's gonna pick a
fight about that causing damage just
kind of you know a couple like quick
blasts at the corners to get the dust
out the point to make is that the dust
that would have accumulated if you're
looking at a scenario we're like either
I spray this out with compressed air
or I'm not gonna ever touch it if that's
the scenario then basically you're
looking at your the dust accumulation
will be far worse for the fan than
whatever meager damage that might cause
to the bearing lubrication or something
like that from three seconds of spinning
in a circle which they're designed it to
anyway and yes they're not not supposed
to be spun when they're not powered and
the electromagnets off but I don't think
it's gonna be a problem I'm sure there
are people all the people who are the
great defenders of fan rights will
probably dispute that but I don't care
it's like like spraying air at a fan
doesn't bother me out you're not just
don't sit there with an air compressor
and like watch it spin for five minutes
that's probably suboptimal for the fan
but yeah I think it's I don't I think
it's fine next question
dr. guns for hands says Steve I heard
some talk of people overclocking
monitoring fresh rates how does this
work and is it something that would be
compatible with free sync do you think
or would it break them I'm actually not
sure about free sync or do you think but
I'm sure some of the comments can tell
you I have not looked into overclocking
monitors for years and the last time we
did was in 2014 we ran an article on it
which is probably show on the screen or
something and Michael Kern's to that
article for us and he did the monitor
overclocking at that time so I can tell
you how it works outside of free sync
and gsync most the monitors have on the
market have some overclocking range like
60 Hertz displays you can often get them
to 80 if you're really trying you can
get them to maybe 96 it kind of depends
on the scaler so if there's no scaler
and they're like the old UNIX displays
that were popular in 2014 those QX
displays didn't have a scalar in them
and you could achieve 94 or 96 rather
Hertz on them without much issue in most
cases otherwise 80 is somewhat common so
it just depends on that I'm not sure
what the current climate is on scalar
inclusion and qyx monitors monitor
coverage is not where I specialized
Michael Kern's kind of covered that of
stuff a lot and Eric Hamilton covers
stuff a lot in the news segments but the
next item item of note is unstable
monitor overclocks are pretty obvious so
if you try to push to 80 Hertz and the
monitor doesn't like it you'll see
artifacting or there'll just be no
display output and at that point you
just try and roll it back it's it's
really like most other overclock and
it's trial and error until something
stops working too many revert your
changes and next one is this so
overclocking this these are notes from
Michael's article if anyone's curious
overclocking display is 10 darken the
screen it can lower the gamma and of
course there's warranty concerns we
don't really care about those on this
channel though and then also with DVID
this is probably less relevant now than
it used to be but with DB ID you had to
raise the pixel clock of the cables so
you could do that through an video
control panel or catalyst whatever it's
called now crimson Radeon settings that
one Radeon settings you can install a
patch that's available online from
modders or I think Nvidia might support
a natively now and you change the pixel
clock of the cables to help with the
overclock and then in precision and
afterburner there are other options as
well for tuning and I think I wrote a
few of them down here
yes sir precision gives you options for
LCD timing modes so Kearns and his
article suggested leaving those alone
for starting and mentioned that just
overclock the display to start with and
then you look into tiny modes later to
try and get more out of it if you want
to it's kind of like anything else with
timings where you're just kind of
tweaking at that point for the sake of
tweaking but yeah the article on that
will answer more if you're curious but
those are the very basics of it it's not
too hard to get started with it's just
you depending on the display you're kind
of fighting for not a lot of gain a lot
of the time the qyx displays we're a
great example of something where you get
some serious value out of it a lot of
the sort of Korean be panel displays are
like that where you can buy them for
cheaper because they didn't meet the
requirements for whatever was and then
trying to overclock it yourself to hit
the high refresh rates but I think
that's it for this one so as always
