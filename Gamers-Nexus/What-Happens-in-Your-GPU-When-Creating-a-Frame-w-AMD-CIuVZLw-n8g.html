net and i'm joined by robert Haluk of
AMD we're going to talk about GPU
rendering pipeline and DX 12 but before
that this coverage is brought to you by
cyberpowerpc who make the fan book that
we recently overclocked past 4 gigahertz
so Robert can you give us a quick run
through of the top-level GPU rendering
pipeline what's happening on the GPU
between the game engine when a scene is
being drawn yeah sure so from a really
high level the game will ask the
graphics card to do something the CPU
will pull in that information order it
up for the graphics card and send it off
to the GPU the GPU will interpret the
work as provided by the CPU that's
that's what you would call a draw call
anytime the CPU asks the GPU to do
something and then at the front end of
the GPU you have a hardware scheduler
which organizes the compute and the
graphics and the memory workloads and
then sends that through the graphics
pipeline where you set up the geometry
the texturing the lighting the effects
and then you spit it out on the other
side and that's raster graphics it comes
out in your monitor so we're in the
pipeline when you're working with
geometry does that get drawn before the
shaders are applied or before the
effects are applied yeah geometry comes
first and then where do the ACPs come in
for AMD with the x11 on this case so
that's at the front end of the GPU with
the hardware schedulers or the aces
that's where the GPU decides is this
compute work or is this graphics work
and then schedules those separately and
then with dx12 so do the ACPs benefit DX
well for rendering yeah so in directx 12
there's this feature called asynchronous
compute where the set up for effects
like compute related effects depth of
field artificial intelligence GPU
physics
a lot of camera effects the the setup
work for that can be done independently
of the geometry work so you can do those
at the same time so when the model is
finished the geometry is finished the
setup work for all the compute stuff is
already done so you can jump right into
rendering that out and that saves a ton
of time what would you say in some of
the we spoke to Roy Taylor previously
about this at the capsaicin event what
would you say is the responsible element
for some of em these gains with dx12 and
recent benchmarks I think it's two
things one is asynchronous compute we're
seeing five to thirty percent uplift out
of that feature which is just huge but
also it's more of a long-term strategy
for us mantle was a big piece of that
first off winning the console cycle
getting all the developers familiar with
AMD hardware and how to use our
architecture every game developer studio
that produces for console has AMD
hardware the same kind of hardware that
we use on the desktop architectural II
and and so we train them on the console
then we gave them an API on the desktop
that work very similarly and then all
the desktop gaming api's now kind of
look and work like mantle so when you
put all of those pieces together in a
chain in a story you see the results in
directx 12 people know how to use
low-level api's on our hardware they
were trained to it where does where does
vulcan play into this compared to dx12
programming on the game side is does it
have similar gains for AMD how does it
work well Vulcans still pretty early
it's a you know I've seen developer
conjecture that it's like eight months
behind directx 12 in terms of
development but there is already a game
the Talos principle more coming we know
that but Vulcan is based on mantle so we
took the entire mantle project or the
api specification and donated it to
Chronos last year so they've built on
that to make it multi-vendor multi
operating system but at its heart it's
still a lot like
mental so I closing us out here give us
a quick run-through of what you guys
have at the booth at pax sure so we're
doing a five-on-five League of Legends
turn them in and then I believe saturday
we're switching to a different game than
sunday we're going to do user choice
we're showing oculus VR some of our game
partners like Banner Saga just all the
the good gaming stuff that we're doing
right now very cool so that's the AMD
booth at PAX East 2016 link in the
description below for more information
photos things like that thank you for
watching we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
