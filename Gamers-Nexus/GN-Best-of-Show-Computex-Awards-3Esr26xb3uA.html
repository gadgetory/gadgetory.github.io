Nexus awards show for Computex offering
such prestigious awards as least amount
of RGB at a booth and actual
Innovation Award after a grueling week
at Computex with dozens of meetings on
the books we're recognizing the most
innovative PC hardware companies from
copy Tex 2018 and will be recapping
their contributions to the industry
we're excited to give these awards out
they have a 3d laser engraved to gamers
X's tear down logo and a three and a
half pound glass cube with exceptional
detail that shows individual components
in the logo we have MOSFETs PCIe outputs
cooling fans and more Easter eggs in
there although the companies need to
earn their awards to display them you
can buy your own gamers Nexus tear down
crystal statue on the store gamers axis
net page where we have medium/large and
keychain sizes we decided that
Coolermaster should receive the award
for the most improved year-over-year
after comparing all of our vendor trips
last year versus this year coolermaster
had clearly made the most strides to
drastically overhaul their products the
company's new lineup looks promising but
they've managed to do these overhauls
while sticking to the original design
goals and aesthetic this combination of
traditional design and modern up fits is
what stands out to us the coolermaster
SL 600 M is one of the more interesting
cases this year the bottom-to-top intake
ventilation is distanced enough from the
table to permit good airflow and the
front panel doesn't need to be open nor
does the back panel theoretically this
in combination with large fans should
eliminate most system noise from the
users perspective the top of the panel
is blocked off which we originally
raised as a point of concern but there
are two positives here for one it's
removable aluminum top and it still
looks good when removed while being mesh
and for two Coolermaster is planning to
add a middle step height to the panel to
allow more air to escape allowing it to
be propped up partially the age 500 also
looks to be a great adaptation of the
more expensive H 500 people match
accepts at a $100 price point these
products are some of the most promising
cases we've seen at Computex this year
and they are significant improvements on
design and show that cooler masters case
team is forward
thanking everyone now we're here
continuing our award show a cooler
master's booth I'm joined by Marte oh
and Cedric and we're presenting an award
to them we looked at all of the vendors
we spoke to at Comdex 2017 last year
looked at the same vendors again this
year and basically we looked at for this
award the the criteria was who has done
the most to really improve their product
and further their brand and we think
that that award goes to Coolermaster so
I hope present' that to you and then if
you do want to say anything to the
community
sure so thank you Steve first of all and
we really appreciate and text to all the
community that are always pushing us to
improve our products our Cannavale Thank
You Steven give me a nexus team really
appreciate sometimes a bit difficult but
we really appreciate the feedback you
saw but yourself and the community so
thank you although we joked that not to
his award was for the quote least amount
of RGB at a show the company does
genuinely deserve recognition for its
function focused approach to componentry
the NOC to a booth was populated with at
least a dozen advancements in its
products ranging from a small fans weeks
to large cooler overhauls given that
there's only so much you can do with air
cooling out of given a budget it's
impressive that Noctua has stayed true
to its customers and its fans and hasn't
gone for low-hanging fruits of LEDs or
gimmicks
we appreciate not to us straightforward
performance focused objectives upgrades
for the year include simple ones like
blacking out coolers to larger ones like
managing to get a 120 millimeter cooler
to the same level of thermal performance
as the 150 millimeter knocked with d15
fans have also been completely
refactored this year including
refactoring of the brand new a twelves
to fit a 140 millimeter format Noctua
isn't just scaling the design they're
re-engineering it at each size that's
the right way to maximize performance
I have Jacob here from knocked away so
Jacob you receive the prestigious gamers
Nexus did not have a booth full of RGB
 award
we're actually actually having real
innovation at Computex so allow me to
present you with
our Taiana were very much we're deeply
honored thank you
they're bearish showcase was among the
most unique at the show not only was his
phase-shift cooler an excellent showing
of new technology applied in different
ways but it's intended to be a product
for consumer purchase regardless of the
volume of this type of product we think
it drives the industry forward to think
about new ways of doing things and the
phase-shift coolers usage of a low
boiling point fluid makes perfect sense
to eliminate pumps this also reduces RMA
rate removes a point of failure and
reduces pump whine and noise even for a
low volume product we see this as a way
to keep everyone on their toes in the
cooling space constantly innovating to
try and find new methods so continuing
on our awards show journey the first
award we gave out was knocked to us
which was for the least amount of RGB
 in a booth and now we're giving one
to dare Bauer who worked on this thing
we have a video on this this is DJ our
phase-shift cooler so for this one you
get the award for most unique to our any
anything you want to share with the
audience I'm actually really happy you
know I sold out and I was like they look
really impressive I didn't even consider
that I would get something like this so
yeah really happy about this thank you
so much man absolutely there you go
there's got the second one we've given
away ever so dubrow is one of the few
thank you kingpins pool in solution
isn't coming to market unlike their
Bauer's but it is genuinely impressive
we've never seen the overclocked or
light up so much when giving a demo and
it's for good reason
in the final hours of the show kingpin
added a straight pipe for exhaust making
for an excellent showpiece that
attracted crowds all day we worked with
kingpin to overclock at 79 80 X e under
the Robo clock or semi open liquid
nitrogen loop and were able to reach 5.7
gigahertz with minimal effort its
semi-autonomous you type in a target
temperature value in a Python program
written by 10 and the system applies Ln
two until that temperature is reached
it's also capable of retaining upwards
of 70% of the liquid nitrogen used as
running completely frozen allows the ln2
to remain in liquid state allowing
recapture
in the output tank for all of this
kingpin gets our Innovation Award as the
first time we've ever seen a mixture of
automation and overclocking in such
effective fashion so for the next award
we're giving out this one is going to
cane pin this is our GN Innovation Award
or as we called it one of the other ones
the actual Innovation Award because it's
not the ton of it at Computex every year
so when there is actual innovation we
want to give it out this thing is the
Robo clock or that's what kingpins
winning the award for and I'll let you
open haha so cool wow I'm so proud thank
you so much now we're giving away our
last award for the show and you know we
were thinking we brought all these
awards over there were not that many
products that really really service to
the top as deserving something truly
special like the GN award we thought of
all the people we spoke to for the week
and decided actually Sasha deserves an
award Sasha was our tour guide at the
Guan ha Digital Plaza and if you haven't
seen that video should check it out he
basically showed us around the whole
place there's a great video we talked
all the matters about GPU prices so
Sasha let me present you with one of the
GN award crystals awesome thank you do
you have anything you want to say to the
audience yeah if you're ever in Taipei
and you want to look at all the geeky
stores let me know I'll show you around
Thank You Sasha we'll see you all next
