Z and Joe you were with me at the the
Intel event right yeah I had the
pleasure
Pro pro overclocker and we're going to
we're trying to figure out what we
wanted to do and I think we're gonna do
a rip there Bauer so what we're gonna do
for the overclocking so we have an L on
to container with us here Joe is gonna
walk me through just everything because
just everything yeah there's just all of
it oh so that'd be good cuz we haven't
we haven't done any L&amp;amp;T stuff here in
the lab I've done island overclocking
with Roman before which really just
amounted to me like pouring or done he
did all the work and then Joe has also
got a new channel he's he's sort of just
launching right so bearded hardware is
the channel throw the beard yes in the
way of the logo I'll link I'll link that
in the description below though you
should check it out subscribe to them
give them some support starting out and
you'll see more extreme overclocking
stuff over there I think right so lots
of overclocking before that this video
is brought to you by the coarser 1i 140
compact gaming PC the Corsair 1i 140 is
a small form-factor PC outfitted with a
9700 K r-tx 20 80 32 gigabytes of RAM
and a 480 gigabyte nvme SSD all housed
within a 2 millimeter thick aluminum
chassis the Corsair 1i 140 is a 12 liter
system fit for desktop use with the same
size the I 160 counterpart with
higher-end parts
learn more at the link in the
description below yeah I wouldn't if you
want just ripped it can you rip off the
cars and like keep them together it's
not hard to put okay yes yeah because
the loops all disconnect I know it's
hard to see there's so much paper towels
yes let me get the my board out so have
you already insulated that one no okay
what are you gonna do for insulation I'm
going dirty liquid nitrogen is white
like negative 196
yeah but depending on what you're
benching so on the big platform it's
usually actually it's probably back
making bad noise on the big platform
you're bitching around minus 100 Celsius
okay to minus 110 it depends on the chip
usually like on 9900 K you'll bench at
minus 196 okay these chips with the
farboro you know the power technology
huh they tend the cold bugs okay so it's
not a good a good thing
what is this Sokka heater that's a
socket here yeah I'm not sure if we'll
use it usually I use it to kind of keep
the CPU we don't really max out on the
CPU and we're trying to go for yeah
total GPU clocks right as you don't to
be messing with the CPU at the same time
when you do it liquid on the GPU so that
helps with trying to make everything so
just to make sure it doesn't call bug or
what well no I just say it basically
it's so a lot of the times you have
condensation that builds up so when the
condensation builds up on like memory
start bugging out okay so you'll be like
all of a sudden you'll get some weird
air and then you it's trying to
eliminate that so by heating the board a
little bit the memory doesn't get as
cold gotcha is this so let's just go on
the back of the board or is this just
yeah it's just it's kind of uh just a
foam okay foam piece yeah yeah so I just
basically put it in here
okay pops in real nice I got to insulate
the back too
I just want to make sure there's a lot
of ass in there cuz I don't want to lose
a board yeah nothing worse yeah that
isn't a board especially when you're
going after a good score that definitely
just hurts for soldering and resistors
giving you tips there yeah I see you're
applying just Vaseline all over the
board yeah so what happens it's like I
say if we do put the cards on liquid
nitrogen it's gonna freeze down here
mm-hmm so what I'm doing is trying to
combat that for use by putting Vaseline
everywhere what we'll do is we'll take
like a heater after and melt it okay and
then that spreads it better
gotcha but I'm just trying to get into
the base you have a and you'd like a
heat gun or anything
I'll show you in the second readers oh
this is dista got a phone yeah I know I
like the brush better again these were
new to try it seems like I'm getting
foam everywhere you have a brush there's
this very small on that one yeah I'm
just glad we didn't do it on the other
side it's not conductive or anything
it's just kind of a mess like this well
the problem is is if we get into the
memory socket its pen right yeah like I
might just mess it up and all of a
sudden you can't get like good memory
clocks
you'd be surprised even touching memory
can be like a pain in the bone it could
be the matter of like not even Bhuvan
that's why usually like crc yeah the
memory you mean like every time I take
them out just like contact cleaner yeah
yeah humidity when we were doing this
last time was like 22% yeah so we were
hearing good shape there I don't think I
can get under 60 or 70 most of that yeah
yeah it's 32% right now so cuz it's like
basically where I live in in Tampa it's
like it's like Taiwan yeah yeah you know
when we bench at Computex you see how
much water and yeah moisture is in the
air shouldn't nightmare that's why I
killed Robo clocker
when I was standing there with with
Vince mm-hmm he kept saying she's done
ski Steve yeah it's pretty funny
I get the funny part is I can I think I
heard him say that yeah you were
standing there doing that so that that's
like kingpin paste oh yeah that's my
Smurf stuff yeah so the brush still
works better okay are you gonna so I
mean putting this back on is it just so
you have somewhere to put it cuz both of
that chips that's not really gonna get
hot enough to worry about right well
together it gets it I'm to be honest I'd
rather just have it cool okay so I
usually just keep the I can keep that
one on
I might not actually put everything else
on right do you want to try the the
Beast today or you can use a different
one no we're gonna use the
where is it you don't want to beat their
Bower with his hon Alan teapot
maybe after it's gonna be bad enough
that he loses yeah we'll use the the
t-rex from kingpin okay
for comparison there's Romans don't get
me wrong it is beautiful but hey that
would definitely have to be sanded but I
think the goal here as we've said before
there's really more to go after Roman
here
not Jay yeah Jay is too easy nope again
not helping yeah no but uh yeah bye Jace
got good hardware so I think it's
getting even Jay has really good
hardware and yeah and he went to Alan to
first on though but Roman is sitting up
there I know here's the talk about third
or something yeah he's like take that
out we do this do they really need to
have these many screws I actually forgot
about this you set up this with the
poles just foam on there no this is
basically a thermal pad okay interesting
yeah so what happens is you're trying to
transfer the heat yeah to the pad to the
board we'll have it all for a for now
okay so now we put this on there so if
we want to use the heater just transfers
heat yeah to the board so when do you
primarily use the heater I usually use
it with 3d okay so like when we're
Benjen with cheap GPUs I'm liquid
nitrogen ah I find it very beneficial
okay
it was actually more beneficial with
79-80 a lot of the times with 79-80 cuz
remember the new ships are soldered
right right so on the older chips there
was always this like maybe the first 20
minutes bench and you'd get your top
score and then then you couldn't run
like so if you ran five eight as your
top score you wouldn't be able to run
five five even okay after a period of
time so if I were to use a heater I can
bench about 575
so it's a little bit lower than the top
Glocks but then I'd be able to run the
cards pretty much for hours and hours
okay so that way I it would extend my
bench time right well yeah so that first
time
so Jay when Jay got his Ellen to
instructions or something he got his
instruction from Ken pin himself oh yeah
yeah you think you can you can outmatch
king pins level of your instruction so a
lot of times people use foam in here
uh-huh
all the way around I don't have any
phone oh I have some if you want to use
it yeah movie nice so I have this stuff
from Vince if that's a see what the
easiest see if this has uh really
depends on big yeah so the point is to
try to keep as much air around the
socket I don't write so a lot of times
what I'll do is I'll just I usually put
a paper towel on it ah and I'll cut out
pieces I got this when I bought this
from Vince I don't know if he sends this
to everyone or if he just saw that I
ordered it but I just ordered it on his
website without telling them and he sent
this note with it this to to my best fan
KP really so I don't know if it's cuz he
if he just recognized her it was going
or if he was just trolling you does that
for everyone no probably not everybody
so one side it's a reference to like a
street fighter or something I think
straight but yeah anyway what reference
is that who is the manager I came there
sometime oh I think I know it's someone
like one like ko or someone but they
sign that note just take out a little
bit I'm just doing this quick and dirty
yeah usually I spend a little bit of
time and what I'll do is I'll put a
paper towel down around and then I'll
glue cuz this is glue uh-huh and I'll
stick to glue it so that way it's
removable I say and then this wicks it
up okay that makes sense yeah once you
get this done then you pretty much don't
have to do it again so this is just I'm
going a little bit overkill there
scissor
livestreaming - yes I'm okay with
overkill yeah I don't want these
actually not that over I don't want the
stress of like not having the stream
anymore five minutes into it do you
bother covering up these caps over here
not really I'm just usually I just uh
flip maybe a little paper towel in there
right okay we can what about like in the
socket area anything good is anything is
it worth it any condensation get in
there well we get the conversation over
here just gonna flow into naked part
it's probably good to keep it cuz it
worked by the socket if it goes into the
sacrum
yeah that's probably good but or is good
and needed look at this filled with
containers are filled with cryo and I
it's kingpin he took her it's like had a
thermal get your heart out devour yeah
it's pretty funny actually let me spray
that before we end up again that's like
next-level disrespect no it's good stuff
actually I mean I was playing I useful
to be honest yeah yeah we've we've used
the kpx and cryo not yeah so basically
if you want to clean the CPU just spray
it on there ah you can tell how much
it'll just evaporate it yeah you know
how much cleaner it is yes like it's
pretty easy yeah but this stuff is like
nice cuz it's like if you like like I
said before if you get paste in the
socket this stuff is killer because you
can just literally hold the board upside
aside and just spray like this right and
all of it will come out so instead of
using like I've seen people use X rush
and rushes yeah all sorts of funky
things I kind of laugh at those I see
do you like a toothpick or anything I
don't know where you're suppose I don't
know I mean I've been okay and how much
people go what are you doing x4 one of
the reasons are I do X have you ever
done the mirror the mirror
goodbye paste I've I don't know I've
done I mean this is how I apply it on
these yeah that's a big big thing you
know there's air they yeah that's in the
middle yeah I'll do like a small dot in
the corners if I feel like it's on off
but it doesn't really matter it also
speeds out any yeah
thing is there is a point where there's
too much pace but at that point so we
retested that and that point is like
literally that entire yeah that's what I
mean like there's got to be a shit ton
of it yeah like it's it's the point at
which it's getting into the vrm yeah so
up until that point you're fine
yeah cuz it squeezes it out and that
tighter you do the part then yeah and
it's gonna not gonna be that difficult
right most people because I hear that
all the time they're like oh you're
doing too much you're introducing too
much grease I'm like I don't care I can
enough CRC you know I sprayed off yeah
right it's just funny on the Facebook
groups and stuff that yeah we can go
metal I haven't found a case where it's
like it makes a difference you want to
just decently other than too much in
which case doesn't do much because
mentorship and stuff yeah these ones are
a pretty sick though that's not too bad
oh all right so I'm basically what I do
here is to try to get rid of any hair
that goes oh it's just kind of like
stuff in the paper towel in there right
okay a little bit it's blocking that air
from getting under the pot yeah just
trying to stuff it in there a little bit
I'll put it a little bit more in there
I'm gonna put this on here ah okay keep
an eye on that let see if it moves grab
that cable here thank you
we need the UH what you're gonna plug
the RGB ni this because we can't
overclock with that RGB really does that
not true okay that liquid metals that
short is not gonna get us a lot of power
it's gonna be like 3% yeah that's gonna
most likely be the problem if we lose a
triple well Roman didn't really do a
power mod either so we're not too much
at a disadvantage that's true sorry you
no need this she did tell you the truth
about the whole J thing he had KP come
to his office to show off liquid
nitrogen and yeah so it's not
necessarily it's fair it's fair these
are the mounting parts for the mora
I think's huge yes you know it's funny I
had like the arute was it is that the
more of three or is it tomorrow three
yeah I think I had a moral one I had a
moral one for a while back in okay wait
a minute more - I don't think so I don't
remember be honest so long ago the one
thing you want to worry about is that
when you're first doing a tank you want
to cause it hasn't been moved so there's
a lot of pressure in it huh is you want
to hold the hose and then turn it on
okay
yeah well I've had that happen once
where the hose like spray well it will
actually go out like this and go like
there's a giant nose smacking a vase
yeah I actually broke the Gigabyte OC
lab door like that see this is a big boy
Jegs big boy tank okay what was Jay
working with yeah like a 10 liter
oh really yeah so we got a 30 liter here
and then we got a 180 a year is that
real men what I could
that takes a while to fill yeah well the
problem is is that the temperature
inside the can it has to change so you
raced a bunch L into changing that
temperature and then once that
temperature goes it doesn't start
soaking but you'll see it's almost done
you'll see it spitting out the top Wow
like that yeah then you know whenever
would touch this hose because you'll
burn yourself so easy just take a paper
towel pop it out like that
there you go voila
mindful of the liquid metal yeah you
doing great yeah okay good so let me put
that on
is that gonna drain oh no you have the
run through so that should be fine
it should definitely drain a bit if it's
working like we should see though I
don't think it's pulling any water in
right now okay I just want to make sure
boots okay Dean one so annoying okay
that guess be 562 dip in water
how do you mind
yes I want to just make sure there's
water in the car though there we go okay
turn it off nice drop off they still
wanna have to worry about cleaning off
the bench yeah
hey go ahead
takes a little that Maura is big
yeah there's it's gonna suck down a lot
of water yeah nice
you're bad at the shish stick talent if
I'm saying Georgia loser
I'm the expert on this one I think so
usually what I do is here when you want
to pour it you just lean it over all
right Jesus
are there any hazards involved here I
mean if you get it on your jeans like oh
well the thing is I'm majorly barefoot I
don't recommend that okay but uh like
you because if you're wearing socks yeah
if the own do gets on there it's warm
more or less gonna hurt you more right
because builds weight has told me that
uh we're wearing like jeans and getting
on your jeans hurt it's almost you gotta
treat it almost like fire in a way like
you can do like basics like that
well you never want to let it soak okay
you want to basically like if you were
just let it soak this is gonna freeze
your hand if you could just like put it
on it's fine come on you see me at
computation say yeah I throat oh yes
yeah yeah so we're looking at your watch
in this instance mer I told you if it
gets yes starts getting although we
should explain it because we weren't
talking on camera yeah we weren't
talking on camera so what happens is
when you get water in the pot you get
ice that builds up and it acts as a
barrier for the liquid nitrogen to bond
to the copper and basically it stops
from conducting the liquid nitrogen into
the copper so it struggles to be able to
keep things cold especially when you're
running tough clocks so we've been
messing with it first a couple hours now
so
no doesn't seem too bad now so we're
gonna just gonna try a couple runs and
we're at right now about minus 60 see
that's you bad let me get a hand here
get how much we have a North not much we
have to do a refill yeah so I guess the
idea is I don't know if water is heavier
Alan's who's heavier I haven't looked it
up but I think it creates like a barrier
between the ellentube coming in and the
bottom of the pot which reduces how
effective it is that cooling oh we
didn't explain that on camera either
which bar
wiping off the yeah you want to wipe off
these a lot of times it also actually
helps for transfer cold into here and
you don't want that but what it also
does is put ice into the pot and then
basically messes up everything so yeah
cuz we don't don't want to do that
water is very ineffective considering
you know Alan - yeah Ellen - is way
better any day now
yes I would hold a lot more lower door
like that you see how it starts going
out and now now that most of the
pressure is out because there's a lot of
pressure that builds up on there so when
you initially open that valve it will
spurt out real quick right right I can't
really do you just go by when you can
see it at the top usually I do it by
like sound sound okay so you can keep on
done doing it right now like just a
little bit fuck
yeah I wouldn't hold I wouldn't hold the
thing any more wait at least six hours
before applying liquid nitrogen what
does that in reference tear is that is
that what it says I mean yeah it's I've
never read it bill Dewar with liquid
night caution filter with that's good to
know that you never read something that
says caution and forget that dude I've
been playing with liquid nitrogen for
over ten years
Yeah right like filter with liquid
nitrogen and wait at least six hours
before applying what
give up killing my buddy Andrew here I
got 50 that's 50 so what is the goal of
this you're just trying to get the Alan
to like what its gonna do is so remember
how hard it was to combat the CPU
yeah the CPU temperature kept on going
up up up up all right
somewhere up up and basically I wouldn't
be able to pour and go CH and get it up
okay so you're basically giving yourself
a little bit more poor mmm bility so you
notice how I'm doing now it's kind of
going away yeah shred your GPU settings
are now yeah you can't man this can
definitely do a lot more so we're not
even what I was doing right I mean under
EPA though or even on the CPU dude yeah
the pots perfect right now actually
we're gonna bitch for a while did it
myself
yeah see the degree difference yes yeah
Haiti we've all know I think it does no
I made it I made it
that was nice look at that that CPU
scores jumped Oh quite nice yes GP has
gone up a bit too so check back I don't
know when this video goes up but
hopefully it'll be before the stream
we'll see check back for the street if
not it's gonna be at 1:00 p.m. Eastern
Time on Sunday the 27th and we'll we'll
have final results for you and hopefully
it also works at that point but if this
goes up after the stream then we will
have a stream recap for you as well so
you can check back for that if you don't
want to watch the probably multi hour
stream so Joe good work I'm glad that
you you helped me a little bit on this
one well I'll see you in the stream Yeah
right
we'll see oh and bearded hardware for
the YouTube channel yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
