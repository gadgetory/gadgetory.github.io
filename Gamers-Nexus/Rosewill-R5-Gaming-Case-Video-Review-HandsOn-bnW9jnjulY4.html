Nexus dotnet and today we were looking
at Rose Wells our five black gaming case
it is a mid tower ATX sized case it
comes with a few fans and some pretty
cool features this case is an $80 range
case so that means it is meant for those
builds that are sort of probably in the
550 to $700 range you could there are a
lot of choices in this range so you
could also go look at the Zalman z11
plus cooler masters storm Scout NZXT XS
and several other cases even dozens of
other cases actually but this does make
my short list of the top five or six
cases in this price range and there are
a few reasons why number one is because
if you want a discreet looking case that
fits in an office environment this is
the case that you'd want to go with the
storm Scout is a little bit more on the
gaming side the z11 plus is definitely
on the game inside because it looks like
a transformer so if you want something
discreet this is one to look at if that
is something that immediately makes you
not want a case then you may want to
turn away now but it does have a good
feature set it ships with three
pre-installed fans and a fan controller
it has two front 120 millimeters that
are fairly quiet one rear 120 millimeter
fan and it also has room for according
to Rose well up to ten total fans that
would be six that can fit in a 120 or
140 millimeter slot and four that can
fit in a 120 millimeter only slot
there's also room for a 240 millimeter
radiator according to Rose well what
they told us so that could fit the the
h100 up at the top actually of the case
right above the CPU and that area is
very easy to access you can just pull
out the compartment and stick the
radiator in there it is also equipped
with a
a dust filter in that same area so you
just flip it out like this and then put
the dust filter in or take it out rather
and clean it on the note of dust filters
this case comes with four of them total
it has two dust filters on the bottom
one below the PSU directly and one below
an additional fan bay it has one in the
front that is easily flipped out just
like the top one is you just pull the
pull of latch and it comes right out and
you can clean it under water and let it
dry and then of course the one on the
top that I've already talked about where
the radiator can go and same thing there
you just pull it out and clean it the
case also comes with the fan controller
that I mentioned it is equipped with up
to three three pin fan connectors right
now and I do have what complaint about
that though that I felt the cable was a
little bit short so I had trouble
getting it behind the case behind the
motherboard rather and connecting it to
that rear fan so I ended up plugging in
the rear fan directly into the
motherboard and then routing and hiding
that fan controller is wiring behind the
the drive bays and connecting it to the
front two fans so that was a bit of a
problem for me because I don't want
cables going cutting straight across the
middle of my case it looks ugly and
sloppy so I did not connect the rear fan
to it but you could connect another one
of the front fans or the top fan to it
if you have a lot of cable or an
extender this case also has a top
mounted i/o panel so you won't be
kicking it with your knees when you walk
by it has one USB 3.0 port it does have
the 20 pen USB 3 header so I can plug
directly into boards that support it
unfortunately it is only one port which
I thought was kind of weird because
normally you'll see two with that but I
guess that's the decision they decided
to make so it is one USB three two USB
two one eSATA and audio out and a
microphone in port it has two buttons of
course the reset and power on switch the
fan controller all of that is on the top
mounted panel the inside of the case is
where it tries to shine though because
it does have I believe for cable
pass-throughs with rubber grommets on
them so there are four pastures for your
cables to be managed and routed nicely
behind the case unfortunately the four
pin or eight pin 12-volt connector that
plugs in near the CPU normally in the
top left is not able to go through the
back and out the top because the top
just isn't there's a hole up there but
it's not big enough for for a cable so
there's just no way you're gonna do that
you'll have to run it probably to the
left up underneath the video cards and
then plug it in there the back side of
the case does have enough room to fit a
fat 24 pin connector and still close it
took a little bit of trickery to get it
to close but it does close so you can
fit some fat cable back back there I'm
not sure the exact depth of that between
the motherboard mounting wall and the
side panel for the case but it is enough
for your cabling and there are the
standoffs where you can tie twist ties
or zip ties with cables to keep them all
in order so there is also exists in the
back and the front so you can tie things
down and keep them nicely organized so
they're not in total chaos in the back
there's also the tool list design for
the entire case so your expansion bays
are using thumb thumb screws and the
drives the optical drives are mounted
using also screws they're different from
the Thor version two that we reviewed
which was more of a push design a
push-pull design for the optical drives
that I complained about for breaking
easily but this one instead of that push
design has a typical screw turning
design so you just turn it unfortunately
I did think that the hard drive bays
were pretty flimsy they weren't flimsy
to the point where it'd be a
deal-breaker for me on the case like if
I'm considering this or the z11 plus the
hard drive bays would not be what make
me change my mind
ultimately but they are flimsy and they
feel pretty cheap which I just as
general philosophy didn't like but they
do get their job done I was worried that
faster rpm drives like 10,000 to 15,000
p.m. would cause vibration but normally
if you have that kind of speed drive
you're not gonna be using this kind of
case in the same region with the of the
external days I had trouble with cable
management because normally in cases I'm
used to there being some kind of pass
through or chiseled out area between the
actual bays and the wall for the
motherboard mounting wall but
unfortunately in this case there is not
one that means you have to if you're
gonna pass a cable through the back of
the case you have to either do it
through the drive bays the bottom drive
bays for hard drives or through the
grommets you can't do any cool tricks
with hiding cables by by like stuffing
the optical cable between the power
connector between the mounting wall and
the bays itself but again nothing
game-changing and beyond that we're
really just looking at the main features
for this case being reasonable cable
management reasonable dust filtration
actually very good dust filtration and a
completely to list design in the eighty
dollar range you can actually take out
all of the dust filters without
dismantling the case something that many
cases cannot do that's all there really
is to say about the case in terms of
overall features if I had to give you
other options I would definitely say
consider these almond z11 plus the
cooler master storm Scout NZXT is LexA S
and of course whatever antic has out
there in this range I think it's
probably the 900 though it may be a bit
more expensive so definitely look into
those options if you have any questions
at all about this case or about this
build or anything else we do at gamer
