news about someone 2016's at biggest
releases news has emerged regarding
battlefield one titanfall 2 beta and no
man's sky before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by i buy
power and their new element gaming PC
which is a large full size tempered
glass side window and uses arc LED
lights for the fans and underglow
lighting for the underside of the case
starting off with battlefield one EA
announced that they'll be having an open
beta test starting on August 29 you want
to participate for this open beta ea
says that players who sign up as a
battlefield insider and choose their
platform before august twenty-first will
be able to receive early access to the
beta the battlefield one open beta test
will feature two modes to choose from
rush and conquest the objective for the
rush mode and past Battlefield games is
to protect crates from the opposing team
trying to destroy them and conquest mode
is also unchanged with teams battling
for control over spawn points scattered
across the map it's more traditional in
its implementation both modes will be
featured on the San I desert map which
can support up to 64 players in other EA
news titanfall 2 is also going to have
its own beta testing this month respawn
and EA will be having that what they
call an open multiplayer technical test
the first testing period will be on
August nineteenth through 21st that's a
weekend and a second also on a weekend
will be from the 26th 328 titanfall tues
test starts on August nineteenth and
will feature two game modes a
five-on-five bounty hunt mode and an
eight on eight pilots vs. pilots mode
the objective of bounty hunt mode is to
earn points by killing enemies and
grunts to deposit these points into your
team's bank the pilot versus pilot mode
has no Titans in it as the mode might
explain and players fight using their
guns on the ground a move that was
commonly requested for the first
titanfall game as the game's foot
gameplay was pretty strong the second
titanfall 2 technical preview is slated
to start on august 26th and will feature
modes from the first tech preview august
26 test will also include an additional
game type which is a six on six mode
called amped hard point and the amped
mode puts two teams against one
other one team defending the hardpoint
and the other of course trying to attack
it titanfall 2 will have 3 maps
available during its technical preview
two of which will be available during
the first on august 26th and there's our
boomtown and homestead and the second
preview will give players access to the
third map which is called forward base
code I our last news topic is about no
man's sky the no man's sky team has been
testing an experimental branch of the
game to fix bugs in the PC version which
we detailed by the way in our frame time
analysis video the developers are
continually updating their progress on
steam and the branch as they are testing
to see if they can fix some of the games
many graphical issues the new patch will
allow no man skies work properly with
Andy phenom CPUs and will also add
support for the 6000 series of AMD GPUs
and the team says to expect performance
improvements on for thread and a thread
CPUs something that's been lacking thus
far the patch will issue alt-tab crash
fixes for the game and also recover lost
or corrupted saves and we're also glad
to hear that the patch should
theoretically reduce the stuttering that
players see while capping their frame
rates to 30 or 60 FPS using the cab
built into the game lastly no man's sky
the update anyway will disable g-sync
now by default as this was causing
serious graphics issues for some users
including ones that we reported on no
man's sky also received more news this
week when the game's director Sean
Murray said in an interview that there
might be paid DLC in the future this was
in contrast to previous reports and
statements from Murray that said no
man's sky would receive free DLC updates
with no paid DLC in the plans Sean
Murray was quoted by gamespot as saying
maybe in the future there is some reason
why we just couldn't possibly afford to
do a certain feature without charging
ports and went on to say that if you
hoped for things like pvp multiplayer or
city building highlighting freighters or
building civilizations this isn't what
no man's sky is over time it might
become some of those things through
updates and based on that quote it
ultimately does sound like the market is
getting the better of a bright eyed
developer and DLC will likely be
available in both
and hopefully still unpaid variant
that's all we have for you today
