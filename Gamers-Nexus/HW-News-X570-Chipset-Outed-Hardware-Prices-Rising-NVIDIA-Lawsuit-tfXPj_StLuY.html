recap for the week very busy week for
news especially with Computex coming up
in the next two weeks you'll want to
make sure you catch the coverage of the
show of all the newest hardware for the
rest of the year AMD - announced in
na'vi new is that III Intel is facing
some new vulnerability concerns and
there's tariff terror as manufacturers
panic over the increased prices so we'll
pour one out for them before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
grizzly and their high end thermal
compounds thermal grizzly makes cryo not
paste for high thermal performance and
conductivity without being electrically
conductive so you don't have to worry
about shorting components cryo knot is
particularly good for replacing stock
GPU pastes as cryo knot is a non curing
compound learn more at the link in the
description below
first news item for the show then it's
very cold right now it's liquid nitrogen
by the way quick thanks for watching our
stream the past weekend we did two
streams back-to-back and they were for
extreme overclocking on the kingpin card
and we have more coverage coming up of
that with liquid nitrogen for some sort
of practical use cases so you want to
check back for that every order by the
way of the sign mastering the stream has
shipped at this point for the sign to
mouse pad so thank you for picking those
up paper is very cold the first news
item Andy announcing Navi at e3 Andy
already has a large event at Computex
we'll be covering it live from the event
and our recap of the coverage will go up
shortly after the livestream concludes
most likely but there's also an event at
e3 and that's the next horizon gaming
event where Lisa sue the CEO of AMD will
be hosting an event about gaming that
doesn't technically say what the
products are about at present but it
does say it will be upcoming products
and technologies that will power gaming
from PC to console to cloud for years to
come so it's going to be navi basically
it's what we take away from that we can
easily infer here that this will include
coverage of Navi on our end we'll
probably be talking about it assuming
that's what's there I mean it probably
is because let's face it AMD has
announced a lot of its previous video
cards at e3 and used a very similar semi
ambiguous wording as is peen used here
so
previous cards announced at e3 by Andy
include the fury XD that would be the
Radeon r9 orx 400 series for example
which was teased to press a bit before
that in Macau at a event just before
Computex in Taiwan so based on Andy's
history here hopefully it's a video card
if it isn't then we're very sorry for
misleading you but it probably will be
PlayStation 5 will we already know we'll
be using the 7 and we rise in 3000
silicon and some variants of Navi this
is officially known from mark Cerny at
Sony so that's not a rumor and that will
likely have some more details at e3 as
well so we'll keep an eye out for both
of these things we intend to cover them
if they are discussed but either way
Andy has an event at e3 and it will
discuss some kind of hardware we just
don't know precisely what it is yet so
stay tuned for that
definitely something exciting to look
out for as it'll ramp up our coverage
for the year rising 3000 s the next big
thing for us with Navi or hopefully
around the same time but we'll see it
depends on IMD's launch schedules and
all we have to go off of right now are
rumors from the interwebs and that's
always very reliable next one tariff
terror a lot of manufacturers have
reached out to us in the past couple of
weeks actually the past past four days
specifically asking us if we're going to
be covering the tariff increase and this
actually affects us too
GN from a manufacturing standpoint not
just from a consumer standpoint so the
word we've gotten is that the new tariff
hike
increases the already hiked tariffs from
10% to now 25% this is in the US and
this affects basically every consumer
electronic or component you can buy so
some instances are not affected for
example memory last time we talked about
this was left unaffected for some reason
and then various combinations of
keyboard and mouse but not mouse or
keyboard were unaffected by the tariff
hike so those things won't change too
much peripherals won't change too much
but you should expect to pay more for
power supplies the 25% increase will
affect power supply manufacturers
directly we have spoken with now four of
them
and the problem is that power supply
manufacturing requires a special setup
for the factories and you can't just
snap your fingers and spawn another one
so almost all these are in China right
now
as such the power supplies will be
impacted by the new 25% tariff and
you'll likely see that cost passed on to
the consumer because the margin for a
lot of these things is not that big
already so the increase will see it
depends on the margin for each company
which power supply line it is some of
them might be willing to make a loss
leader in some instances but you should
expect to see some price increases this
will primarily affect the US market it
will affect Canada as the u.s. is a
major port of entry and then it can
indirectly affect the rest of the world
for component pricing because the u.s.
is the largest consumer of components
and is the sort of the the benchmark for
where manufacturers set their baseline
prices so this can affect everybody but
especially the US and especially the
companies in the US that are selling
these products and making them as for
what's impacted well other than most of
the metals used to make products like
cases or everything there's power
supplies video cards motherboards not to
our knowledge not memory that may have
changed but as of now not memory and a
few other things as well like coolers
things made out of copper aluminum
things like that so how does this go
down well a couple of the factories are
shifting some of their manufacturing so
the a lot of the AIB partners for
example make stuff in China actually all
of them make something in China at some
point but the final product is what
matters the most for the impact of
tariff where it's coming from where it
was finally assembled and at least one
of the AIB partners has moved
effectively all of its manufacturing
operations to Taiwan from China and so
that board partner will dodge this
tariff they will have probably a price
increase because it's not as cheap to
manufacture in Taiwan as China but they
dodge the tariff it's still not made in
the US it's made in Asia because
where the entire supply chain is so this
should surprise nobody but it is made in
Taiwan so what you're going to see is
some of the factories moving around
we've heard that Vietnam is another area
of interest for potential factory spin
up and doing manufacturing there instead
of China and other parts of Asia because
they want to remain close to
headquarters they want to remain close
to the supply chain for small components
for example a lot of them are made in
China or Japan or Korea and so being
close to those is beneficial and this is
something that you've probably learned
about in our factory tour coverage in
the past couple of weeks where a lot of
those factories are miles away from each
other not thousands of miles away from
each other so that matters too so we'll
see as far as what prices are affected
it'll depend on how quickly
manufacturers move their manufacturing
operations we know that gigabyte has a
factory in Taiwan and has been shifting
more and more of its production to that
Factory has hired on staff there to
increase the output of the Taiwan based
Factory and hopefully dodge some of the
tariffs as well as far as how we're
impacted at gamer's Nexus our mod mats
will get hit with this tariff but only
when they come into the port the next
time we don't have we still have some
inventory so we're leaving our prices
alone until that inventory is gone and
we did that last time too and we also
last time we didn't have to increase the
prices so we took a big hit I took a big
hit on the margin when the tariffs went
up last time but we didn't have to
increase their prices because we had
enough margin left to still make a
profit with this next change I haven't
run the numbers yet but it's gonna be
really close to 14 us to increase the
prices but we are going to try and keep
them as low as we can we'll probably eat
some of our own margin and then might be
forced to increase a couple bucks or
something to balance it out but yeah
it's it's not gonna be fun so that that
impacts everybody keep an eye out for it
it'll primarily be when people import
stuff although some companies in the
past have increased prices preemptively
to profit from it ahead of time but we
are going to wait till we run out of
product to evaluate that situation
hopefully
the tariff will be gone by then more
Intel boner abilities and ham the okay
for now I think we did this in the intro
but it's fun so let's pour some liquid
nitrogen out researchers n to Intel have
recently disclosed cold a collection of
new speculative execution attacks that
are known as our IDL or rogue in flight
data load zombie load and fallout
included with that you may have heard
those names the last few days so these
new potential exploits are known
collectively as MDS attacks or micro
architectural data sampling attacks and
chips are affected ranging from the
ninth generation or 9000 series which is
built on eighth generation which built
on you got the idea
dating all the way back to CPUs from
2008 perhaps later the latest round of
side-channel attacks leveraged similar
techniques used in meltdown inspector
and leaked otherwise secure data from
CPU buffers exactly how secure these
attacks are depending on who you ask
Intel gives them a low to medium risk
assessment per the CBS s standard based
on the complexity involved of pulling
them off researchers however estimate
the attacks to be quite severe going as
far as recommending disabling
hyper-threading and calling the attacks
worse than Spector media coverage is
equally varied with some outlets taking
an almost alarmist tone to others being
a bit more passive the good news is that
Intel does have mitigations in place but
as with previous software were OS level
based mitigations there tends to be a
loss of performance and it's mostly a
band-aid fix the only permanent fix to
these flaws is new processors and they
need the in silicon mitigations built
into the actual hardware and the
presently believes that due to the
nature of its micro architectural design
it is unaffected by these newest
side-channel attacks and vulnerabilities
however as is the case for as was the
case with previous speculative execution
attacks there is a chance that
alternatives can spin off as malicious
actors begin to research options so
different clones or variants could and
probably will surface whether those
affect Andy will obviously have to be
evaluated as they as they appear
additionally these specific attacks
rely on architectural elements unique to
Intel
at present for the time being there are
no real-world exploits using these flaws
that we're aware of nor the researchers
out in the wild anyway and aside from
the proof of concept you're probably
safe at present still consider any and
all mitigations available to you this
would include things like BIOS updates
for previous mitigations and Windows
updates yes we know it's it's terrifying
and fortunately for you or maybe not
when there's probably updated in the
middle of the last time you were doing
something important on your computer and
Vidya sued for infringement of five
semiconductor patents up next so and
video appears to have found itself in a
legal battle with expiry and its
subsidiaries who contend that Nvidia is
in violation of no fewer than five of
its patents for the unaware expiry Corp
and its subsidiaries which would include
Invensys corporation and tessera
advanced technologies develop and
license a wide range of intellectual
properties expiry are a knowledge ease
for pro audio mobile image codes and
automotive invents this creates advanced
packaging and interconnect IP for
semiconductors which brings us to the
suit with Nvidia the suit filed with
Delaware federal court asserts that end
videos GPUs and supercomputers are
violating five of the company's patents
patents and IP law are often a slippery
slope but XP RIA has defended these
patents before against giant chip makers
like Samsung and Broadcom Xperia one on
both of those accounts with both Samsung
and Broadcom entering into multi-year
patent license agreements with expiry
we'll see how this shakes out but at
this point it's doubtful and video is
going to discredit the validity of the
patents in question in an unusual and
somewhat unprecedented move Microsoft
has circled back on its long abandoned
Windows XP to deliver a critical
security update this is aimed at
deworming the once popular OS that users
won't let die and in fact we saw Windows
XP on use in several of the testing
environments in China and Rhetor in
those factories mentioned earlier but it
makes sense because if it works don't
change it I guess is the mantra if it
ain't broke don't fix it as part of its
May 14th patch released on Tuesday
Microsoft delivered a critical security
update for one
XP Windows Server 2003 and Windows 7
which a lot of you are still on and head
off a were mobile flaw in Remote Desktop
Services Microsoft decided a potential
wanna cry like exploit that it was
targeting the quote was today Microsoft
released fixes for a critical remote
code execution vulnerability CBE 2019
zero seven zero eight and Remote Desktop
Services formerly known as Terminal
Services that affects some older
versions of Windows the Remote Desktop
Protocol or RDP itself is not vulnerable
this vulnerability is pre authentication
and requires no user interaction in
other words the vulnerability is quote
were mobile meaning that any future
malware that exploits this vulnerability
could propagate from vulnerable computer
to vulnerable computer in a similar way
as the wanna cry malware spread across
the globe in 2017
while we have observed no exploitation
of this vulnerability it is highly
likely that malicious actors will write
an exploit for this vulnerability and
incorporate it into their malware
explains Microsoft in a blog post so the
vulnerability doesn't yet affect to our
knowledge publicly Windows 10 or Windows
8.1 or Windows Server 2012 and Beyond
but anything older than that you might
want to get your updates rolling
despite probably not wanting to biostar
outs x5 70 chipset specs and highlights
power delivery for the next AMD CPUs
that should be announced at Computex and
these 500 series chipsets will accompany
the rise in 3000h processors at CES this
year we spoke with AMD at length about X
570 and its new processors and at the
time
Andy was still uncertain whether X 570
would come out immediately with Verizon
3000 or would wait an extra month
because it just depended on motherboard
manufacturers being able to get their
operations online in time and depending
on the chipset which was a big question
mark and AMD was still working on
especially with the PCIe for support and
obviously speaking of that the new x5
does have any chipset marks both the
arrival of PCIe 4 and Andy's departure
from as media in terms of chipset
designs something that we reported on in
the beginning of the year with our CES
coverage Biostar has revealed some
details of
as flagship am 4 X 570 board whether
intentionally or not ahead of Computex
2019 the racing X 570 gt8 definitely
looks like a bio star motherboard and
that could be a good or a bad thing
depending on your aesthetic preferences
however the racing X 5 SOT GTA
highlights a focus on vrm construction
and quality as the board boasts a 12
phase power delivery system no doubt
meant to accommodate and these expected
higher core count CPUs the chipset
itself is also actively cooled with a
fan which lends credence to the theory
that the addition of PCIe 4 flattens the
new chipsets TDP quite a bit over and
these 400 series chipsets and speaking
of X 570 we're going to have a lot of
motherboard coverage at Computex this
year it's actually our leading story for
the show it's one of the first things
we'll be looking at is X 5 sony boards
so make sure you check back for that but
another point of interest here in this
story is that the significantly higher
memory frequency of ddr4 or 4000 after
overclocking is supposedly going to be
supported with the new platforms and
CPUs memory support has been a growing
pain Verizon platforms especially at
launch but with X 470 revisions with
BIOS updates and with the motherboard
rollouts over the past year it's
improved significantly we expect to see
this continue to improve with X 570 so
it's good to see Andy overcoming some of
its earliest limitations when Rison
first launched that's going to be it for
this hardware news episode thank you for
watching subscribe for more go to store
documents X's net to helps out directly

access to behind-the-scenes videos and
hopefully we're gonna use the rest of
this stuff soon for some additional
overclocking of the kingpin card in a
practical sense you'll see more about
that later I need to get rid of this so
let's just let's just roll the outro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
