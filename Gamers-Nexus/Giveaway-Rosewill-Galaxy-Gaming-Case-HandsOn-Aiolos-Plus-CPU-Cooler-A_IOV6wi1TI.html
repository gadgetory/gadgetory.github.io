at rosewood headquarters this is boo
again you see me in a couple of events
I've got coffee Texan CES but here we're
here with game of Nexus and they're
stopping by to take a look at one of our
new cases where just released here
behind me as you can see our our new
budget gaming related Kangin cases and
their title galaxy so here we have three
models you have to galaxy 3 galaxy 2 and
the galaxy one right in the center with
the side panel open they all priced at
around $39.99 so it's definitely target
for the budget gaming cases out there
and we've introduced three models with
three distinct exterior looks so that
it'll give you more options to choose
which exterior will fit your personality
and your type of builds so I'm going to
quickly go over the specs and features
of the case that'll come with one USB
2.0 on the top two USB 2.0 on the front
mic audio three expansion slots with a
quick release vehicle and just like the
unsnap this little feature here
you just slide it out a death support
three five no quarter four three and a
quarter one internal and it come with
three pre-installed fans all 121 in the
front around the rear and one on the top
but you do have an option to install a
fourth fan on the side it will support
either a 120 or 140 millimeter it is a
bottom mounted PSU and on the very
bottom there is a filter for your power
supply and all three galaxies cases will
feature the same options as well so here
taking a look at the inside the galaxy
cases you'll see there are cutouts for
your cable management options and there
is a large CPU cutout to support your
large air-cooled CPU coolers as well it
will support up to seven expansion slots
and the case is fairly light itself it's
only about ten pounds so you won't hurt
your back lugging this around to your
gaming party's your then game and events
over to the right here you'll see our
mid tier gaming budget case and this is
the Roseau Patriot this was launched a
few months ago but this is the first
time that media here has covered the
case and it's our first case that does
include a window side panel it'll have
your quick releases for your five and a
quarter there's support up to six
hard drives three-and-a-half inch hard
drives it'll have one adapter that
allows you to install a two-and-a-half
inch hard drive on there with your
solid-state dress that will come with
the total of four fans two in the front
one in the top one in the rear the top
does support two fans total I mean to
120 to 140 or one single one eighty
millimeter fan and it does have a filter
down to the bottom to support your power
supply and the piece who is also bottom
mounted there are also cutouts as well
to support you cable management there's
about one inch of space back there so
it'll give you a lot of mountain space
for your cable management and there is a
large CPU Kyle to support your external
CPU coolers as well keep your system
nice and cool and lastly what we have
here we've just recently launched the
CPU cooler as well you've heard of our
Rosal I love CPU cooler this is the
enhanced version of that igoe's plus
pretty much what we've done we change
the installation method for Intel soccer
processors you will normally install
them typically with those plastic fork
lifts on each corner but these here will
use a metal secure screw to give you a
more secure fit and because the most
important thing about CP coolers is
contact with the CPU pipe and your CPU
itself with these screw type mounting
type you'll be sure that your CPU cooler
is getting correct contact with your CPU
to keep it nice and cool and this will
