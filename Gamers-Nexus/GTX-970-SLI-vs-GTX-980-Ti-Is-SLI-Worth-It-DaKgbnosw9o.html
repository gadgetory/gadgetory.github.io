dotnet and today we're doing an SLI test
using two 970 s against a single 980ti
to see what is the best value because
they're about the same amount of spend
you can spend 300 to 350 ish on each 970
putting you at about the $700 range or
you can spend in the 650 to $700 range
on a single 980ti
in our tests we also included a single
980 and a single r9 390x just to give us
some perspective because those put you
at the $420 range for the 305 hundred
range for the 989 ti but what we're
really looking at here is the two 970 s
and sli versus the single at 980 TI so
here's the thing with sli in the past
and this is true of crossfire as well
the multi card configurations have
sometimes proven to be difficult to work
with so in some scenarios some games
some driver sets SLI and crossfire
scaling is so bad that it is sometimes
almost better to disable one card and
run just a single device and obviously
that that's kind of sucks to do because
then you're just throwing out half of
your graphics processing configuration
out the window with SLI and DirectX 11
which is everything we tested today you
generally get an alternate frame
rendering environment and you can't
stack the vram so it's effectively using
the second card as an additional
processing engine and the vram is
ignored for all of the testing
methodology check the link in the
description below that is the full
article it contains a lot more depth and
will explain how we tested these games
and what pitfalls we may have
encountered or may have had to avoid in
the testing of these games given
specific parameters and graphics
settings and things like that in Metro
last light the 980ti is favored and wins
by four point seven eight percent over
the nine 70s an SLI making it the better
Buy and definitely be more simple route
to go in terms of configuration and
that's at 1080p looking at fall
for at 1080p as well the 980ti is again
favored over the dual nine 70s and that
is a five point four eight percent
advantage in the average FPS department
but there's some points to talk about
with the one percent in 0.1 percent lows
which we'll get into momentarily after
running through these charts shadow of
mordor at 1080p sees a favor or an
advantage for the nine 70s in SLI but
the advantage is so small at 1080p that
it is effectively an observable it's a
one point eight seven percent difference
that is measurable in testing that is
outside of our margin of error but as a
user you will not notice that difference
at 4k resolution there is actually much
more noticeable difference it's nine
point eight eight percent of the frame
rates much lower as well so again sort
of hard to notice but 59 verse 53 ish
fps does actually give you some
advantage in gameplay with the witcher 3
at the lower resolution of the two
tested the 970 is in sli are objectively
superior it's the 980 eye and there is a
noticeable difference
the 970 SLI configuration performs
thirty point zero seven percent better
than a single 980ti and that is
definitely noticeable and makes the nine
seventies in sli a better value than the
same price single card configuration at
the highest resolution we tested looking
at that chart now the witcher 3 shows a
19 point seven percent advantage for the
nine 70s and hassle i'm making it
interesting because it actually scales
differently than the other games we
tested where you'll see sli scaling
improve as the resolution improves over
the 980 i in the witcher 3 that is not
the case and then two 970 s actually
lose some ground but still remain about
twenty percent ahead of the single 980ti
black ops three is a bit different title
it is highly performant very optimized
and runs well on most video cards and
this game favors the 970 s an SLI by
seventeen point two three percent at
fourteen forty and ten point one four
percent at 4k
assassin's creed syndicate is brand new
and syndicate when it launched had
terrible sli scaling it was actually
basically non-existent
so at game launch you were better off
just disabling one of your cards because
they were big hits to 1% and 0.1% low
frame times and that was a result of the
way AFR works and sometimes you'll get
kind of a micro stutter with SLI so that
happened when the game was brand new but
has since been resolved through driver
updates and optimizations so now looking
at the game with the newest drivers the
performance is actually much improved
but the 980ti is still favored by eight
point two eight percent so again you're
better off here with a single card
configuration and that now makes three
points the nine ATI and two points for
the nine 70s in SLI Just Cause 3 is a
game where there is absolutely no value
to SLI because there is ZERO scaling for
the most part very little scale in any
way and the 980ti actually wins out by
twenty six point eight nine percent so
similar to The Witcher 3 the nine ATI is
objectively superior The Witcher 3 of
course the 970 is an SLI or superior but
there's a bit of trading back and forth
here with Grand Theft Auto the 970 s an
SLI have an eleven point five three
percent advantage and that is improved
again over the scaling of the game when
it first came out so that was a driver
improvement and we can draw a straight
line here that shows the gains that
nvidia has made in their drivers with
sli as the as time goes on as drivers
iterate so day one launch drivers
generally are not great for the support
of SLI in the past year as we've seen in
testing we've done all these videos now
we're gonna look at SLI scaling that is
the Delta the percentage difference or
Delta in performance between a single
970 SSC and two 970 s one being the SSC
the other being the hybrid 1080p scaling
in Metro last light the dual 970
configuration is twenty six point two
six percent advantaged at 1080p over a
single 970 a pretty big gain but not
super impressive especially considering
the ninety eighty I was the better card
for this game and it is thirty eight
point nine three percent advantage at
1440p and forty three point two zero
advantage that 4k fallout 4 at 1080p
scaling is 31 point 1 2 percent favored
for the SLI configuration over a single
970 so again a major improvement shadow
of mordor 46.1 4% at 1080p so is it
worth doing 970 is an SLI as opposed to
a single 980ti depends on where you're
coming from if you already own one 970
then it is clear that in some of these
games four of them that we tested the to
nine seventies are actually better than
a single 980ti and as someone who
already owns half of what you need the
value isn't bad because you've already
spent 300 350 whatever it is hopefully a
while ago so that money's gone ahead now
you can buy another card and in some
cases improve your performance by 50%
and GTA we saw 60 percent performance
increase at 4k and in black ops 3 57
point eight nine percent at 4k to the
point where it's actually very playable
at 4k using nine 70s so depending on
where you're coming from if you already
own half of the configuration it may be
worth doing 970 s an SLI as a new buyer
as someone building a new system today
then I would generally recommend a
single 980ti unless you are very
specifically playing one of these games
that had a heavy performance advantage
over the single 980ti and when I say
heavy I mean more than the one point
eight seven percent in shadow of mordor
five point four eight percent in other
games so the 90 is did better in Metro
last light single card fallout four
single card and two more games
Assassin's Creed syndicate single 980ti
Just Cause 3 single 980ti the United 70s
had a massive advantage in The Witcher 3
which is really the only title that is
showing the huge advantage we saw and
then in black ops 3 where it was it was
big enough performance gain at 1440 to
put you close to 144 Hertz if you're
trying to get that really fast and fluid
FPS gameplay experience then the SLI
configuration is effectively required
unless you're running a lower resolution
like 1080p in which case you can get
with a single card if you overclocked it
a bit so in our testing there were four
points for the 970 s in SLI and four
points for the 980ti single card in
terms of the head-to-head they were tied
with each other depending on what game
you looked at but the difference of
those points the value of those points
depends on the game the nighti I was
always a minimum when it was a head of 5
percent against the 970 s an SLI 9 so DS
an S law I got as high as 30% ahead in
The Witcher 3 here's what I would do if
I own half the configuration already I
would do a 970 SLI setup if I really
wanted to push into 1440p and in some
games 4k playability now you're still
not gonna be playing 4k with most games
even with 970 and SLI because it's just
it's limited in a lot of ways vram is
definitely one of those if I'm if I own
nothing nope no card no build and I'm
building today tomorrow sometime soon
then the single device is the route I
would go and that is for a few reasons
one on day one with game launches there
is better support for single cards
they're the same price or there abouts
anyway and the night II I did have a 4.2
4.3 Zolt against the 970 s in SLI they
were head-to-head exactly with some of
these games I would also choose a single
card configuration because the 1% and
0.1% lows were advantaged to the 980 I
almost every single test that's
something that's not shown in just the
Delta scaling values every single test
the night II I had better 1% and 0.1%
lows as compared to its average FPS
output and that is what will affect your
gaming fluidity and how smooth the
framerate output looks as a user what
the apparent smoothness is despite the
average FPS so for those reasons I would
give an IAT I route if building a new
system if you're doing an SLI setup
because you already own one card 970 is
an SLI aren't bad the scaling is
actually very good these days for the
games that it does get supported by Just
Cause 3 excluded here in these tests and
originally Assassin's Creed syndicate
though now it works
better with SLI than it used to with its
33% scaling so that is all for this test

and if you want to learn about that 390x
and its performance in these tests check
out that article we'll do another video
on am the devices specifically crossfire
things like that in the near future
thank you for watching I'll see you all
