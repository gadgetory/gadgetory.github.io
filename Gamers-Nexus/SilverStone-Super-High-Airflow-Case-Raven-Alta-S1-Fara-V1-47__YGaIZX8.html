Computex 2019 Silverstone is always one
of the more interesting booths to visit
at the show and it's because a lot of
the time their performance focused a few
of the cases here though and some of the
fans have RGB and I I wonder if it
physically pains Tony that's hard to do
such a thing but it's not a bad thing to
try and hit some of the trends in the
market Silverstone is one of the one of
the smaller K spenders we work with in
terms of the volume in the US market but
make some really good stuffs like the R
l06 was probably one of the top cases on
our charts along with the Raven O to the
our v02 for a really long time and this
kind of calls back to the rv0 to design
and is what we're going to be focusing
on for today before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte z 390 ARS
master motherboard which comes equipped
with one of the more powerful z3 90 V
RMS for heavier overclocks on the new
9th Gen Intel CPUs the ARS master is
also one of the few motherboards with a
really heatsink this generation
featuring a mix of high surface area
fins and looks oriented cover blocks oh
and it's also got updated our DV
illumination
learn more at the link below so this one
is the alta s1 is Silverstone's new
flagship case so it's been a little
while since Silverstone's done big cases
like this they've been working on a
raven prototype for a while and we saw
it at CES actually and that's here as
well but this is like I said more so
much the rb0 too so it's got three giant
fans left in the bottom the rv0 2 was
one of the best air cooled cases on our
charts forever it still is we still
retested every couple years and that one
has 180 millimeter air penetrator fans
on it so that's how it achieves the
performance at the time and it didn't
have too much to do with the top to
bottom air or bottom top airflow because
if you rotate in that case and put it on
its side to perform the same so it's
just because the fans were good this has
a 120 at the top that's very high
pressure shoots the air out of a fine
mesh on top of it mashes removable it's
one big piece right now I guess I'll
mention as well this is like super
prototype so I think they're a little
bit nervous about like the glass for
example being open but very prototype
phase not final changes could be made if
you have feedback on this like the other
booths post your feedback below they'll
read the comments they really do
and if you have something like genuinely
useful to say let them know you might be
able to influence the design anyway so
three two hundred should be included
with it they think they are a RGB fans
it's a new two hundred millimeter fan
from silverstone and then the top 120
should be included and it's a pretty
simple layout so the motherboard is
rotate actually it's inverted i guess is
the appropriate phrase but inverted it's
on the opposite side of the case
obviously amount to the left wall to the
right and in inverting the motherboard
you end up with a bottom the top cpu
airflow as well with tower coolers which
is really the proper way to use this
style of case just like with the rb0
tube and then the video cards and i've
been direct airflow path of the front or
middle fan for the two hundreds the
front of the case is glass so it's
actually I mean it's irrelevant on this
case that there's glass on the front
because all the intakes on the bottom
and unlike some of the other cases we've
just seen coming from enter Max's view
the bottom does have proper like spacing
ground clearance we like to see about an
inch for optimal airflow on most the
cases we test and this has got that
especially important when you have two
hundred millimeter fans which have
naturally lower static pressure than
like the 120 or 140 you do need that
extra space to breathe which is present
here so we obviously haven't thermally
tested it but based on experience if
it's anything like the RB 0 2 it should
be pretty promising there is no firm
release date it's like a first half 2020
type of thing is potentially a target so
maybe we'll see an updated version at
CES if not a near final version other
specs for the case so there's two sets
of two by 3.5 inch cages in the back for
hard drive cage that are there presently
there's a a set of two USB type-c
connectors in the front for USB type
three there's a reset switch which I
think might be our GB control on the
back panel the case we haven't opened it
because its prototype so maybe some SSD
mounts back there or something
the price that you've likely been
considering while looking at it is
probably going to be in the range of 300
but that's not final so that could
change up or down and part of the price
you know then obviously I mean the fans
aren't cheap that adds the bomb a lot
that adds the bomb but the glass panel
is really what drives the price on a lot
of these types of cases because and I
don't know what the yields are for this
but I do know the yields of some of
silver stones can
editor's for curved glass panels like
this and it can be as low as 30%
depending on the degree of the curve so
this isn't like the steepest degree or
grade we've seen but as you start
curving twice on the tempered glass the
failure rate gets higher which drives
the cost of the product up so that's a
that's a really tricky problem to solve
and one that silverstone is still
working on and figuring out right now
but anyway that's the alta s1 it's
probably the most interesting of the two
cases or of the few cases we'll be
talking about from a luke standpoint
from a performance standpoint it also
looks promising which I don't say often
it shows but based on experience because
I've basically tested this design before
it should be good but wait for our
testing obviously so overall I mean
they're hitting the looks and and then
it looks like maybe a bit of performance
as well for the other cases so there's a
Farah v1 that's suppose we got $70 more
mainstream case than this there's a far
up b1 but the B as in boy for $50 and
the primary differences are RGB so B
one's got RGB fans we don't have a firm
answer on how many are included but it
sounds like maybe three fronts a RGB and
one rear 120 I don't know if the rear
one will have a RGB it seems like seems
like too much giving too much away for
her Arg fans that's $70 so I don't think
that's gonna hold true but but maybe
we'll see the b1 will have one exhaust
fan and it should be similar to the one
that's in there now and our b-roll shots
the front of the v1 is a mesh and then
the sides of it are an acrylic presently
so that acrylic will probably change so
I'll just I'm still playing around with
the looks of it and and and that could
that's up to to how it goes through the
show and feedback they get but the front
smash on it so that looks good and then
there's another case on the other side
of the booth called the Isetta which has
an aluminum front it's got some curves
to it it's more of a looks focused case
than anything else and steel panels for
the rest so it's got a steel white top
and side panel tempered glass on one
side and and then I guess we'll just
show b-roll for the rest that one
because this looks focused not
performance focus so I think oh the last
the most recent prototype of the Raven
is here as well
I'll show some shots of that so we saw
the prototype of the Raven at CES the
big question silverstone
asked which you all eagerly answered was
have the clear acrylic or black or matte
color and the the response I guess was
deafening because the designs changed a
bit and it looks better now
so Raven is like a lot of these still
TBD on some information will show you
b-roll of it I'm not going to go through
specs because they still might change a
bit so the last part of the booth that
we didn't look at would be the fans and
this one is the one I was talking about
with Raven zero to the original Raven oh
- that was kind of similar to altar
design where that case had three of the
180 millimeter air penetrator fans the
bottom that's what made it perform so
well because they're reasonably high rpm
while being big and they have like a
flow guide on the back of them but so
they've got one of those on the wall but
there's new high performance or high
pressure street fan it's a fatter fan
design it's actually kind of similar to
some of the fans we just saw at the Chen
Jenny market in China so we actually
bought some that were similar to this
that were like not wired yet I'll show
this in a separate video later but
anyway fatter design high pressure it's
got two switches on it 38 millimeters
thick so it's quite a bit bigger than
like a 25 mil fan for example and a
two-speed switch on it this one's got a
switch on the back as well right there
and it's a reversible airflow fans you
spin it each way and I don't know if you
like install and then you're lazy and
don't want to take it out I guess you
can do that and then the RGB fans are
kind of new for silverstone where they
are tentatively waiting into the the
waters of of RGB LED over the past year
or so but the difference is between them
so hub illumination reign illumination
and hub and reign illumination that'll
wrap Silverstone's booth so thank you
