officially day one this is our first
video for ddc and we're playing magic at
two I am joined by a lot of people here
we've got David Martinez doing PR for
paradox interactive who published magica
to Matthias working on as a producer
yeah I'm magica too and I'm Kenny from
destructoid who is hanging out so so
we're going to blow each other up and
play some wizard battles here but he is
what can you tell us about the changes
with the second game yeah well the 2nd
game well it's more of everything you
loved in the first game of course we're
still using the same core of the game
play with the elements and the spell few
changes are for example you can move
while you're casting spells it's a new
engine graphics and so the graphic is
much much better also netcode is stable
less less bugs and I really mean it it's
Leslie less bugs this time and one of
the key things we added is something
called artifacts with the game-changing
elements which look at my core let's
jump into again yeah sure um I gotta ask
you David what what what is this device
what is this you have handed right for
you pc only folks that's what we call a
controller did you in did you invent
this from magica uh that is really am I
was it was conjured but my sony we are
playing the game today on a Playstation
4 but it will certainly be on a PC would
never ever ever drop our PC audience
with love you guys okay let's let's jump
into a game okay you can move while
casting now yeah that's one of new
things what are these one of these icons
above the elements here yeah well what
we did with the magic from from Attica
wellness that in the first one you
queued up them up and then you use them
and I Mashka to we have them as hot keys
so it could be a little bit easier for
new players to to you stomp we can still
cross beams yes we but this time you're
not so destructive I mean they're
destructive together or before if you
cross the streams you
just kind of get thrown back yeah the
original but that's not to say that
that's not there anymore if you were to
constitutional court allow me up if you
cross two streams that are from opposite
elements then you'll create like a
little bomb in the center that's channel
the screen you know while I'm learning
where the buttons are on the controller
how does a controller feel in your hands
aha not sure I like it a little scary
after a little scared so we are playing
what is this photo challenge it's a
challenge which is the score based this
is scorch on shuttle call it we were
playing 20 waves of enemies coming at
you and you're getting scores during the
game and while you're getting enough
scores to unlocking new magics so you
cannot use all your magics when you
start so they unlock during the game
sure and also you can't if everyone dies
we have to restart from phase 1 again in
magical one one of the more fun things
for me was the different skins for the
mages yeah so would you can you tell us
about any of them that have moved over
to this game oh well we haven't moved
the ones from metal one so but we
created a lot of more new art assets and
skiing so you will have different skins
at different probes melee weapons and
staffs and that that stuff you're going
to unlock during the adventure mode and
you unlock more of these artifacts that
I'm going to talk about sure when
playing challenges so what are what are
the artifacts their artifacts are
something we call game-changing elements
and with artifacts you can turn off or
turn on different elements you're using
or adding you can change the video mode
adding brutal death so when everyone
dies secondly exploding and flashes and
pieces right so you could do things like
turn
the damage of the fire element of all
the way to the tippy top which is great
for when you're trying to destroy
enemies but also makes it way easier for
you to kill your friends because one
thing we never do is we never turn off
friendly fire okay no no never even
turned off we have some settings we can
tune it down a little bit so you're not
gonna kill your enemy your friends
directly but you're still going to be
able to kill them that's a very
important part of yeah killing of that
yeah killing your friends on accident
yeah I would never do it some from no
never never hey Steve which color are
you ah I cannot talk unreleased products
of this oh I'll just kill this person i
have one new thing is also that the
shields is reflecting beams this is a
challenge mode but when you're playing
adventure mode you're going to see we
have used more of my own mental to
create puzzle so so we either you
explore explore more of the map with for
example freezing more water and finding
secret thank you or you use elements to
complete puzzles to go further in the
adventure and there's also going to be
possible that you don't need to complete
them but if you do you get the reward so
unlocking your stuff that's it so for
people who are you did not play the
first magica what what type of allergic
of the most enjoy the game I think it's
casual players casual action players so
for for magica to do you have an
intended release target yet blaming for
q2 grand available on steam for pc
audience i suppose yes yes of course so
we've got running through the the game
modes really quickly we've got adventure
mode yeah it is more like a story we
have challenge mode which we are
currently playing and beating each other
up in yeah and then kawana rating we
call it cooperate cooperate yeah yeah
yeah have you have competitive
cooperation is
I think of good summary for magica so
that was magica to hit links in the
description below for more information
on the game I was just blown up again I
think by one of my teammates here links
in description below check it out we'll
let you know as the game progresses
there will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
