stockpiles for mining a few dollars a
day we have real work we need to do with
them and that is rendering our new intro
animation so this animation was
redesigned by Andrew for the site it's
currently rendering on this machine this
is our main camere and blender machine
for production workloads
you often hear us talking about this is
a production card or a production CPU
well this is a use case where that's
actually at hello so this is where the
real use case is for those production
products and for today we're focusing on
GPUs or using a lot of CUDA power to do
the rendering it's taking about 50
minutes per frame to render you know 120
frames get through that's 120 hours of
rendering and that's for a 2 second
animation 60fps 2 seconds so pretty long
time this is on a Titan X I'm a Maxwell
GPU it's not good enough to right now so
what we're going to do is build a system
that's probably going to use three to
five GPUs around what fits for PCIe
lanes and what fits in the motherboard
and all that and once we have that
system built we can run the renders
again on CUDA it does not need sli
bridges it just needs the video cards
and then see what our pickup is for
render time with a real production
system so this serves two tasks one it
gives you insight as to what everyone
means when they say this is a production
GPU or this is a production CPU and it
also lets you see the behind the scenes
for how long something like this
actually takes to render and so the
reason for updating our animation
blender actually updated its shaders so
we're using new shaders with the renders
and we also have some texturing applied
so this is a this is a non final version
of the animation we have a couple of
tweaks to it but you can see some of the
texturing and new shaders in play and
also it'll be in 4k so that will match
our new camera everything will be in 4k
60fps and that's the point of doing this
before getting to those that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
their 1080p is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx
which are kind of fun to play with you
can check our full fc2 review for the
1080i if you're curious to learn more or
you can click the link in the
description below to find the product
page for the 1080i sc2 so I'm gonna grab
this Quadro this just came in and in
fact I've study so this just came in
this is I think a P 4000 we're using it
for some benchmarking on basically what
is a non gaming card but we're gonna use
it first on rendering stuff
the reason I'm grabbing this is not
because the most powerful thing we have
for rendering because the Quadro
actually this one is not our 1080i is in
our Titan XP will probably render faster
they have more cores higher frequency
but this is one slot so we'll be able to
fit an extra card in by using a single
slot GPU that's still relatively high
power should be about 10 70 class for
rendering the reason it's expensive is
because of the drivers certification but
that's our first one and then we're
going to go to our 1080p I shelf to the
rest so all these cards are GTX 1080p
eyes that we've reviewed plus there's
one more over here that's in pieces type
are the Lightning card but we're going
to grab I have a hybrid in the other
room already for rendering we're gonna
grab an FCW three because two slots and
it's going to be hopefully cool enough
so we have what we need let's go build
that system okay so this is our X 299
production bench one of the ones we've
been using for Vega production tests and
I've got it all hooked up right now to
our current clamp for testing that I'm
doing for build Zoid separately but
we'll talk about that later and we also
have a plug load meter down here which
will allow us to see what sort of load
this thing generates with all these GPUs
to make sure it's within the specs of
the power supply so what I'm going to do
is mount these into an i-9 systems that
has the lanes I need this is why people
complain about Lane count by the way and
why thread Ripper will be interesting
for this application what I'm thinking
it is Quadro here I'm probably I'll hook
up these bands so that the Titan axe can
breathe Quadro here and then I'm
thinking we might be able to squeeze in
a hybrid there
that'll take those two slots and then
maybe an FTW three there so let's try
that first oh yeah right there okay six
pin we got that will be six pin power
for this one okay that Titans going to
stop for a little bit but I'll work it
out okay
hybrid that was hiding in the corner
that's going to be a six and an eight so
we're still good for that please fit
wonder if it's better to put thermals
are the main concern here so I'm trying
to think through it so this is a blower
fan of this on the side it's got a big
back plate on it could pull a minor and
run like a riser cable out of there if
I'm really worried about thermals but
this thing should be pretty low
temperature anyway you know six pin
means it's going to be low power draw to
4,000 is not the highest power dropping
on video makes so it's going to generate
lower temperatures so you know we're
just we're going to run with this we'll
check all the temperatures once I get a
light load on there and decide if I need
to make any modifications anything or
hybrid cool anything and I'm going to
actually space this a little bit somehow
let's maybe we will end up running a
riser let's let's get this in here to
let socketed yes okay one two three four
that's the value of a single slide GPU
even though it's lower power could run a
riser but we're going to try that a lot
of power cables now we'll check thermals
and power drawn next before going too
crazy with the render this is going to
be a little problematic I think so take
the shortest one
okay those will reach the head so those
are candy and IMAX really needs to make
the cables longer this is always going
to problem I've had with enter max
otherwise it's a 1350 watt 80 plus
Platinum power supply so it's great
except the cables are too short okay so
that's good two more seriously this
would not be a problem if the cables
were standard length all right there we
go
okay okay so then this can go over here
that should be will it turn on oh okay
all right we're on so next thing to do
is plug in all of these fans I didn't
think we would need them but that
clearance is just so tight that let's go
ahead and do it for safety there's one
okay should have good airflow
okay all right so all the fans on
there's some wine in here if you can
even hear that I think that's from the
Titan XP I don't know why there's so
much coil line on that particular card
that's incorrect
all right so we got to redo the drivers
it looks like cool man just shutting the
thing down it's at 300 Watts right now
that's the i9 CPU for UI 9 + 4 GPUs and
Idol almost 200 watts
other installations
please work this time that president
we've gotten before finally drivers are
working a little too well
I haven't restarted yet I need to but
we've got 1080i 1080i Titan XP and
quadra they're all detecting QP 104 TP
102 to be 102 keep the 102 they're all
detecting correctly see if it has
thermals for any of these I probably
need to restart for those I guess ok so
good start so I rebooted and got GPZ
open it is detecting everything now so
you can see Titan XP is this is all idle
we're at 36 see we'll see how it does
when it's actually under load that's
probably the hybrid card it's at 27 see
this is probably the FTW three card at
35 see the fans aren't even spinning and
here's the P 4038 C so what we're going
to do is kind of monitor these and keep
an eye on those during the initial
render testing and then once it looks
like it's safe thermally we'll go ahead
and let it rip and I might also
interestingly open up a separate
instance of blender and use some of the
CPU power so one thing we could do to
make use of the i3 Seaforth I three CPU
the high nine CPU would be we could take
two to four of the threads from it and
let blender use the other 16 or 18
thread keep a couple of them open just
to make sure that as GPUs are still fed
properly and then the remaining threads
can render and we previously found in
our eye 9 review that the with all 20
threads available it was out rendering
CUDA so that would be pretty cool to
actually be able to use that capability
plus the GPUs okay there we go Titan xpp
4000 hybrid FTW three so open the render
file for those of you don't know what
we're talking about when we say
production workloads or production GP or
CPU this is what we're talking about
it's
during something like an animation so we
get user preferences computer compute
device for cycles it's going to be CUDA
we select all of them that's pretty
crazy actually see all those so we're
going to use all four GPUs save settings
and then we can open a separate instance
for the CPU if we want over here we've
got image editor is the display but the
important parts are feature set
experimental are supported we're going
to try experimental device GPU compute
rather than CPU we're focusing on GPUs
today and then down at the bottom I'm
going to make sure it's optimized for at
256 by 256 tile sizes this should be
less relevant going forward but as I
understand it today that will speed
things up for us and then for sample
count or actually for resolution we're
at four we should be at 4k 3840 by 2160
so 3840 by 2160 at a hundred percent
that's 4k then we have sample count
we're at 500 which is production-ready
sampling and then we've also got a
thread count for the cpu and here so you
can actually see that it's got 20
threads right here from the cpu we could
fix this and tell it to do like 19 or
something for now I'm gonna leave it on
auto tech so this is our GP render
window anyway so think we're good to go
let's let's start with just one frame
and see how it does and then we'll try
more from there that's pretty crazy
nice I used to see in that like if you
don't do any kind of rendering and this
probably doesn't mean as much to you but
to see four tiles at Tuesday six by
three to six each going at the same time
is pretty exciting so we get a CPU going
to and that would be twenty more tiles
or whatever we assign to it at a at
probably sixteen by sixteen for optimal
speed on a CPU but on a GPU we can get
away with this let's keep an eye on em
per atures are doing so far Titan X P 58
c P 4060 C not bad really hybrid is no
problem at all
hybrid the hybrid sandwiched between
everything doesn't even care at 35 as
the
w3 is a 53 and it's fans are still off
by the way so we're doing okay here so
far it's a power consumption from the
wall is 700 plus watts right now and if
there's anything interested in here for
you so our maximum power consumption so
far 755 minimum 100 and then we've got
bolt amp readings but yeah so we're at
600 700 plus and this is going crazy
fast 780 equals x percent of 1550 so
we're at 57 percent utilization on the
power supply right now it can take a bit
more and we've got fan speed zero decent
on all these things
71 see on a Titan 74 on the P 4000 let's
help that one out a little more okay so
we're going to make this better I'm
going to get some more fans on here
all right 70 and 72 for those first two
DPS right now that'll feed air to the
blower fans which will then push it out
the hole that's warm oh crap
push it out the back what's the I don't
have a thermocouple nice to me so let's
just take a spot reading of like the
furniture behind it
35 see for the shelf behind the video
cards which is not meant to be
scientific it's just meant to be like
man that's pretty warm considering we're
at 35 C on the shelf and room ambience
is a about 23:36 C on the Shelf now full
37 it's going up so that means this is
pretty cool that means the fans actually
helping get more air in there so we can
force it out the back 38 on the park
near the Titan XP all right so we are at
pretty HD just on furniture behind me is
saying the GPUs are now steady at 68 for
the Titan XPS are at 68 here and then 70
for the P 4043 67 and this just looks
like it's still rendering along yes it's
still going so good there our frequency
is dropped a bit on the Titan XP I think
we can pick that up temperatures
dropping a lot Titan XP is down to 60
now so that's going to free up power
let's give it some nice drama core to
670 43 66 everyone's pretty happy
there's our memory consumption so here's
a if anyone's curious memory consumption
on these things
platon XP is at two point three
gigabytes use our animation just let
them use upon a memory we're at 1.3 over
here - and - it is using I mean it's
using a pretty good amount it's at least
2 gigabytes per tile is what we're
looking at which honestly I think we
might be able to step up the tile size
if we wanted but that's doing ok for now
and that fan really helped out the
temperature
is our Titan XP and our slightly
overclocked to that 53 P 4068 instead of
70 that's pretty cool just getting a fan
up that really improved in significantly
we're almost done with the first frame
exams six amps 12 volts okay is that it
that's it rendered time 14 minutes 22
seconds so we have gone down from 50 oh
we have saved ourselves well let's see
over the if you're at roughly 50 to 60
technically so let's just split it and
call it 55 355 420 frames previously
that would be 6600 minutes or if you
prefer 110 hours versus now if we let's
just make some assumptions here and
assume that it is going to be fairly
linear let's go ahead and call that just
let's call it a with that 22 let's call
it fourteen point two five and multiply
that by 120 frame
divided by seconds in two minutes era in
two hours and it goes to twenty-eight
point five hours so twenty-eight point
five versus 110 hours
it's our difference power draws don't
really care about right now because it's
more important to me frankly to get the
render done and not use our primary
production machine which here's the
thing okay so even though it says 110
hours for the first one it's not
actually 110 hours because what's going
to happen is we start the render and
then it has to stop like every 12 hours
so that we can use the machines of do
videos to render videos edit videos
can't run blender during that time so
it's not 110 hours it's more like
probably a couple weeks and this going
down to twenty-something hours less than
thirty means I can set it up run it walk
away from it come back in the day and
it'll be done now here's the thing I
guess well first of all we need to do
some small Corrections on this I guess a
little blown out but
that's still pretty representative of
the time required now the next thing
we're going to end up doing is running a
cpu render at the same time and let's
just give it 18 threads and what's best
here sixteen by sixteen sixteen by
sixteen Andrew tells me for faster
rendering with CPU so let's just get a
rough estimate of this one so CPU render
oh well there we go
eighteen threads ripping through it see
this is where the sixteen core
thirty-two thread thread referred GPUs
will be really interesting is in an
application like this so again this is
what a production machine looks like
this is what people mean when they say
production task is cutting off four
times the time required to render
something that's huge and why I'm also
interested in the future Intel 18 core
chips and the future and the sixteen
core chips but anyway so right now we're
going on CPU I 970 nine hundred X what's
our power draw here 320 Watts
set up quite a bit from idle the GPS are
doing nothing right now 14 amps by 12
volt 168 Watts going to the CPU and the
memory channels
we're definitely against the TDP window
there but so what we're going to do now
is walk away from this let it finish it
looks like it blender thinks it'll take
45 minutes but it's going down rapidly
so we're going to walk away from it CL
on it takes and come back and then
decide if it's best to render on the CPU
and on the GPU simultaneously if it is
we'll let that go and then I hope that
cuts to sound like 20 hours that would
be great
alright so we came back after 47 minutes
and it's still going so despite the 300
X actually being okay and our blender
benchmarks it's struggling here and part
of that is a newer version of blender
where the GPS are just being utilized
better so this it looks like we'll take
another 20 plus minutes to finish
which puts us at over an hour for 18
threads so CUDA is just blowing the sin
away OpenCL I would do despite some of
the blenders previous issues and OpenCL
it's gotten better so basically if we
let this thing run for the entire 20 to
30 hours that the GPUs are running it
will out it'll save us like they'll save
us a couple frames ultimately if you
look at the difference from either end
it's the difference of like maybe a few
hours
natan so what we're going to do is not
burn an extra 200 to 300 watts on the
CPU and the memory and everything else
and just run the GPS only so it'll be
600 to 700 watt draw and CPU won't be in
use other than to feed the frames and
then we should be able to finish the
thin in 28 and a half to 30 hours and
we'll have a new intro animation for you
which I don't think will make it in this
video because it actually does need to
be rendered but keep an eye out because
it'll be a probably silent change over
to the new one and those of you who saw
this video will know where it came from
so that's it for this one hopefully this
gave you some insight as to what
actually happens with a production setup
there are plenty of other production
applications this is just one of them
but it gives you an idea of why you
would use one card versus another or why
it actually matters to save minutes off
of rendering in this case 30 plus 40
minutes yeah we're down to 14 minutes
from 50 to 60 so if you're saving 40
minutes on a render again the real-world
example that we've given you here today
is a difference of weeks of rendering on
one machine or straightforward just 110
hours 120 hours 230 enough time to let
you render something else or increase
your quality settings or whatever it's
