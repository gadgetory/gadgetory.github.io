Nexus tonight and we were back with
another episode of Saturday heat
signature this is our fourth episode
actually where we cover not super
popular games and some of them like
Hawkin from last week have actually
gained a ton of popularity in the last
couple days how can I actually just a
quick update received I believe 10
million dollars in investment I don't
know if they accepted it but they were
definitely offered it so check out the
hakan video from last week if you
haven't seen it let's get to Castle
story we're talking about Castle story
this week I've been I've been bringing
you guys up with it you know keeping it
one up to date for the last couple
episodes now actually since the first
episode I think I even mentioned it so
what we're gonna look at today is what
exactly it is and why it's so cool and
why it has my attention Castle story is
another voxel based game and boxes are
it's it's a little bit it's not super
complex I had to develop or explain it
to me and I'll be writing an article but
voxels basically think of them like your
3d equivalent to pixels not exactly but
pretty close close enough for purposes
of what we're talking about and
minecraft is another example of a voxel
game just to just kind of give you an
cube world as well which we covered two
episodes ago I believe so actually three
episodes ago so Castle story is an
entirely fantasy-based it is based on
flying islands you build what you want
it's free form building entirely free
form build anything you want you can dig
tunnels through mountains you can
explode stuff with TNT and even clean it
up after you explode it believe it or
not the blocks don't just disappear and
vanish like in most games or stuff
explodes they actually will fall and
kind of gather where you would expect
them to when TNT blows stuff up so and
then you can have you guys pick it back
up but that's just a minor detail the
objective of the game is to just build
just like minecraft just build whatever
you want you get creative it's a
creative based game so if you really
like that kind of that kind of free
freedom and games like this and if
you're really a creator type personality
then you'll probably love this game it
is an RTS so it's been referred to in
our post before as a minecraft RTS which
isn't exactly her
fectly accurate to what it is but for
all intents and purposes you get the
idea so it is a strategy game you get
your black dudes which are called are
called bricked Ron's actually and they
look like pineapples they look like
pineapples with arms and legs but they
are intelligent pineapples because they
can use tools and weapons so we get our
brick tron's and the game is actually
really similar to the old settler series
for anyone that remembers those games I
think they still make them like settlers
three and four you kind of control your
units you basically tell them hey I want
to build this castle here and then you
have your designated group of builders
that will go and grab blocks from a
stockpile and plant them down and start
building up walls to the castle so
here's where the game gets interesting
instead of a one by one block system
like minecraft uses it actually uses a 1
by 2 block system it does have one by
one blocks but its primary block is 1 by
2 and what that really means is since
the game has a pretty nice physics
engine its Bay use unity3d as their
engine and then that has a cool physics
hundred inside of it since it has a nice
physics engine that means if you were to
build let's say an entire wall with one
by one blocks each block above the neck
you know every block on top of another
block will rely on the one below it to
stay where it is because it's not
cemented into place or anything so if
you remove the bottom block in a series
of blocks in a wall all of them will
scatter or be destroyed or fall around
what have you because there's nothing to
support them so with a 1 by 2 system you
can stagger your block placement which
means you can remove one block and all
of the others will still stay there
because they're there supporting each
other so and the reason that's cool is
because you can remove a block either to
create a cool design like you could
remove several blocks to create an
emblem in the side of your castle as an
example or if there's glass I they
haven't given any reason to think
there's glass but if there is you could
fill it in with that you could also
create kind of an archer area so if you
think of a traditional castle you could
hollow out some holes in the wall and
then plant an archer there and he'll
have a good line of sight to the enemies
too
be protected and some other cool stuff
like that so there are a lot of really
good uses for a 1 by 2 system and
hopefully these screenshots I've been
showing will help you understand what
exactly the developers were getting out
there because that is one of their big
poles they also have arches and a couple
other different types of blocks so far I
think I've only seen one by one blocks 1
by 2 blocks arches stair blocks ramp
blocks and what else I think there's one
more a half block of some kind but that
might just be a one by one that's all I
know about so far in terms of blocks we
know that for resources there will be
stone wood and definitely some other
resources that they haven't revealed
them yet with stone obviously you can
build your castles you can mine for it
you can declare a mining region in your
Island you everyone starts on an island
and you rally your brick drawn together
and start mining and collecting
resources just like many other games of
this style so you declare your mining
region and if you tell them to your
brick tron's will actually mine through
the entire floating island and fall out
the bottom which isn't necessarily good
for their health but it is quite funny
to watch I have to admit and and so if
you if you want you could actually get
pretty cool with declaring your
three-dimensional mining location in
mind a tunnel and create a huge complex
tunnel network now again this is my
speculation this is my opinion I think
it would be awesome if you could build
your castle inside of a tunnel I don't
know if they'll let you do that but that
would be so cool if you could build like
think of mining a tunnel through a
mountain and then all you have to do is
while off the entrance while off the
exits and hope no one tunnels through to
you from below or the sides and you'd
basically have a dwarven fortress right
there and that's I think that the
customization in this game the potential
for customers customization excuse me is
fantastic they recently said they added
doors which might sound simple but it is
a good step they added doors to the game
it is not an alpha it is pre alpha right
now so so don't be too surprised at that
at me being excited about doors and the
reason I got excited about them is
because they said the developers hinted
that
now they can use the engine to detect
okay does this room is this room
completely sealed and if so how does
that affect other elements in the game
so if you think about why why would a
room being completely sealed helped the
game engine figure something out and
what I came up with was and again all my
you know my own thoughts here not
developer commentary or anything I would
imagine so you could definitely use that
for liquids so filling in a room with
with some kind of water or lava or
something like that I'm thinking for
purposes of maybe I really don't know
what purpose of room full of water would
have other than it be cool but
potentially some kind of liquid because
otherwise you'd have a leak if it's not
completely sealed you could also use it
for line of sight purposes so if you if
you have a ton of brick tron's in a room
that's completely sealed they should
have no line of sight to anything
outside so that might help with that
what else did I come up with here um I
was thinking I think that's pretty much
what I got I was thinking maybe
explosion purposes I don't know if the
physics engine is that advanced but a
contained explosion would definitely
have different effects than a non
contained explosion in real life but I
really don't think they'll go that deep
with it and then of course take over
purposes if you're if there's any kind
of capture the flag or king of the hill
or capture the base anything where
you're taking over basis that would
definitely be another good purpose for
it so I can see why they'd be excited
there are different types of resources
like I said the in tunnels through
mountains all that really cool stuff you
can also chop down trees one thing I
want to note there really optimizing
this game to work well on as many
systems as possible I believe their
exact words where it will run on puny
laptops right now and they're hoping
that will only get better not worse and
they're doing a lot of cool tricks
they're changing the polycount on
objects based on distance so level of
detail based on distance from an object
that way a faraway tree takes fewer
resources than a close-up tree and that
will help a lot for things like managing
your your
system resources on a low-end system to
answer a couple frequently asked
questions before we sign off here there
will will be a beta version at some
point in the future they haven't
announced yet they have said they're
interested in putting out an alpha but
again no current deadline or timeline on
that they are supporting Windows and Mac
natively at launch or at least that's
the plan they want to move to more
platforms in the future but obviously
that will happen only with success or
most likely with success minimum
requirements they haven't given specific
numbers they just said a puny laptop
will support it no cost on the game we
do know it will cost less than a million
dollars that is a quote from the
developers so hold them to that if they
try to charge you more than a million
dollars you're getting ripped off but
that's because they promised it'd be
less than a million there will be
multiplayer so I can't wait for that
taking over your friends castles built
or even building with your friends to
make huge complex cities all stuff like
this on a huge floating islands which
makes it even better because then who
knows what kind of bridges you could
build with many cities on on the bridges
in between islands I think that'd be
awesome there's really there's a ton of
potential for this game so really look
forward to it I'm going to try and keep
you updated as much as possible with
more videos as we get more info and I
will definitely be posting more articles
on gamers Nexus done that probably more
frequently than I do videos so keep an
eye there as well I'm trying to think I
don't think there's a ton more I can
tell you other than what I've already
said so I'm gonna probably sign off with
that and again please like this video if
you liked it please subscribe if you
want more of this type of video we do
one every Saturday we also do hardware
videos now so please subscribe it really
helps us make more videos like comment
anything you can do to let us know that
you're listening let us know that you're
out there it keeps us going thanks again
for your support guys and look forward
to Castle story peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
