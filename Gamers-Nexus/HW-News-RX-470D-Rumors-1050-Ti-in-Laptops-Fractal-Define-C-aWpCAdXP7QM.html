hardware announcements were done for the
year at least I kind of did or hoped
because it's been non-stop since May now
there's still more so fractal has a new
defined CSeries case we'll be talking
about that briefly this Hardware news
recap there's a rumor to AMD rx4 70d
again rumored but we'll talk about what
we have on that so far and then also
some potential alleged leaks on a 1050
ti mobile as in 1050 TI notebook GPU
mobile probably not the best word
anymore because no longer the m suffix
branding before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by AMD's
athlon x4 ATK cpu and now available with
the company's quiet cooler for under a
hundred dollars on newegg pair that with
an FM two plus board for a budget gaming
solution link in the description below
for more information so first up for
this week there are more rumors about an
RX for 70d it's also been called a 465
it's been called the 4 70 s ii but we're
going to go with the name for 70d for
now so the the update versus previous
rumors that we discussed on tgw the
update is basically that the card has
now been photographed allegedly anyway
so this is a card that would be
positioned around where the 1050 ti
currently rests and the rumored for
seven TD was leaked by chinese website
pc online who claimed to have photos of
sapphires for 17 nitro card next to the
existing 417 on d nitro the 470 d if
these rumors are to be believed would
run a shader count of 1792 vs the arch
for 70s 2048 or reduction of about
thirteen percent in shader core account
the card is also rumored to operate at
1266 megahertz boost keeping a 4
gigabyte frame buffer on a 256-bit
interface power draw will be the biggest
differentiator between the 1050 TI and
RX for 7th ed if these rumors are to be
believed anyway but the RX for 7th ed
should theoretically outpace 1050 TI
based on these specs this would put AMD
back into competition at the low end
where its RX 460 recently became
embattled with the 1050 and 1050 TI the
next news item is more alleged leaks
these come from laptop media who
they're testing a 1050 TI notebook
device and we know that there is a 1050
TI that will eventually end up in
notebooks it just makes sense it's a
really good fit in terms of the stack
because the 1060 it offers good
performance but it's almost too good for
1080p gaming on a notebook if you could
instead sacrifice some of that
performance ability and go instead for
better power draw which a 1050 TI would
allow it makes a lot of sense for 1080p
gaming on notebooks where you're more
concerned potentially about the battery
life and things like that than almost
anything else and that is especially the
case when you're talking about
non-gaming scenarios which of course
matters with a notebook in its post
laptop media indicates that the GP 107
notebook GPU will operate with a boosted
clock of 16 24 megahertz and with 768
cuda cores at leveraging a 112 the
gigabyte per second memory bandwidth for
its 4 gigabytes of memory the specs are
largely the same as what we've seen with
the desktop units and that's to be
expected for this generation this year
desktop components aren't being nerfed
quite as hard as in the past for use and
laptops and that again is heralded by
the lack of the M Brandon on these
mobile GPUs and laptop media alleges a
ten percent performance increase of the
1050 ti over the 970 m of course we hope
to independently benchmark attenders DTI
notebooks once they're made available to
us I don't have any yet but we've
already looked at the 1060 1070 and 1080
notebooks at least with varying levels
of depth but especially the 1060 and
hopefully the 1050 ti will bring some
power consumption savings because that's
always the point of concern with any
notebook but the next news item is not a
leak or a rumor or any allegations it is
fractals need to find C Series cases so
the define see cases were announced just
recently in the past week or so there
are a couple of different versions of
them i think for there's the fractal to
find see the define see with a window
same thing just with a window and you
lose some of the padding for noise
purposes and then there are the smaller
versions the mini c and the mini see
with a window which is basically for
micro ATX but is otherwise more or less
the same case you have
so you lose a few features for height
but it is smaller the define see uses
fractals minimalistic approach to design
for what we've seen so far that includes
side panels that offer minimal breathing
ventilation to reduce noise escaping
from the case so a traditional trade-off
where it's a bit more discreet but it's
also going to be words that cooling the
define see includes 11 20 millimeter fan
in the front 11 20 millimeter fan in the
rear of the case for exhaust and options
for up to two more 120's in the front to
that 121 40s in the top and a bottom 120
millimeter fan liquid cooling support
maxes out at a three sixty millimeter
radiator though it is pushing it a bit
depending on what the specific radiator
sizing is the case can also support to
80 millimeter radiators the final bit of
news is more of a PSA at these are
driver updates so Nvidia and AMD both
this week push driver updates for their
existing packages both of which are hot
fixes the AMD hotfix first it's 16 dot
11 is the new driver package but they're
already on 16 11 2 and that hotfix
include shader cash optimization so the
shader cash now has more storage and
that should theoretically improve
performance and more extreme scenarios
and that driver contains the same
updates at 16 11 brought including call
of duty infant warfare calls duty modern
warfare remastered titanfall to
Battlefield one that was already pushed
with 1610 so that's all in there if you
have an MD device you're playing any of
those games or you could benefit from
shader cash changes then grab 16mm to
that should be available on their site
now the next change Nvidia's hotfix 375
dot 76 driver resolves the issues with
high refresh monitor flickering so if
you have a high refresh rate display
that has had some flickering black
flickering lately when you're playing
games or even not that is in theory
resolve this driver update and you
should just download and install it
because other than that it's all
basically the same updates for
Battlefield call of duty abduction all
those games that you would expect it to
have if you're not having issues and
you're on some 37 dot whatever drivers
cheese that's come out recently you're
probably fine if it's not broke I guess
don't fix it
is the same so if your performance is
not having issues if your card is not
broken then probably leave it alone but
if you could benefit from the Refresh
fixes then grab it there's also some
jiff artifacting fixes so if you have
animated gifs and those are artifacting
oddly that actually might be called
caused by video drivers which is not
something that we normally think of when
we see that so that's all for this video
patreon like the post-show video helps
out directly links below for more
informations that'd do that one
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
