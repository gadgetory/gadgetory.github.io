dotnet and today we're reviewing EVGA is
a brand-new GTX 970 hybrid video card
with the ASA tech cooler slapped on it
as found on the 980 TI hybrid and the
other hybrid series coolers right next
to me over here is the 970 SSC these are
both GTX 970 cards one uses the AC X 2.0
dual fan cooler which is pretty
comparable to most other dual fan
coolers on the market and the other one
uses the CLC as you can see here plus a
vrm blower fan so it's a normal
reference blower fan or squirrel cage
fan however you want to call it and
that's for cooling the vrm and the vram
and then for the GPU itself the die it's
cooled by a CLC provided by ASA Tech in
this case so for the specs the GTX 970
hybrid ships at 11 40 megahertz stock
and that boosts to 1279 megahertz its
stock its base clock is actually lower
than what you'll find on the cheaper 970
SSC also an EVGA card and that ships at
11 90 megahertz so you've got a 50
megahertz jump here from the hybrid to
the SSC and a $50 price gap so what
you're paying for ultimately is the ASA
tech cooler on there that is a CLC it
should drop the temperatures pretty
heavily and we tested it it does you'll
see in our tests in a moment here and
that's comparable to the 980ti hybrid
which also uses an ASA tech at CLC and
the thin here with the ACE tech CLC on
these cards is that they are tuned for
GPUs so the GPU die is actually a
different size pretty different from the
CPU die and the main thing with the GPU
cold plates that are on these particular
devices anyway is that they use an
extrusion in the copper so the copper
cold plates a circle and that mounts to
the top of the GPU or the CPU if you
have a CPU cooler the difference here is
the extrusion so there's a big piece of
copper that extrudes out of the cold
plate and that helps sync the heat the
additional heat of the GPU it fits the
physical size of the die better than CPU
cooler might do if you adapt a CPU
cooler to
with GPU and that's what makes the
hybrid series cards historically pretty
good at cooling but we'll see if that's
true obviously with the 970 hybrid going
forward in a moment here the big
difference between that and the other
cards on the market that are called by
CL C's or if you buy an end Exe kraken
adapter or a corsair adapter the g10 of
the hg 10 adaptors and mount a cpu
cooler to it the difference there is
that those do not have the extrusion
found on this GPU cooler on the cold
plate so you will actually see a pretty
sizable performance difference in terms
of cooling ability so that's the core
specs here the radiator is a 120
millimeter fan radiator
you've got the CLC on the dive erm
blower fan for the VR M&amp;amp;V ram and the
core clock is 50 megahertz lower than
the SSC other than that everything is
pretty much the same as any other GTX
970 you'll find in the market same TM
user ops all that stuff architecture
does not change between the different
brand cards so here's what we're testing
today we're doing game tests for the FPS
and that's primarily comparing these two
devices but there is a third EVGA device
that I had temporarily on loan that's at
10 50 megahertz which means it is a
reference clocked GTX 970 so that'll
give us a baseline for how much
difference there really is in these
devices but ultimately you're seeing a
couple percent difference between two
cards like this where there are 50
megahertz gap so we're gonna focus more
heavily on power thermals and of course
overclocking that's a big focus here so
let's forge ahead into that content and
see how everything performs for all the
test methodology and discussion on how
the testing works how we lay it out hit
the article in the link in the
description below that is the full
written review which contains a lot more
information on this video but we do
recap it all here quickly starting with
fallout 4 the GTX 970 SSC predictably
outperforms the hybrid and that's a
result of the 50 megahertz clock rate
gap on the stock configuration the
difference is about 2.5% average FPS
which comes out to 2 FPS on the 1080p
configuration as we venture into
thermals and overclocked in the picture
will become more clear as to the hybrid
potential value but as it stands from
charge it's a tough sell for a
marginally lower FPS on the same model
card for 50 bucks more 400 total
Assassin's Creed syndicate is the next
one to benchmark the results here
somewhat mirrored the fallout 4 testing
producing a 2.8 2% Delta between average
FPS of the SSC and the hybrid and again
that translates in this case to about 2
FPS average it's measurable and well
outside of margin of error it's not
within margin of error so that is a
definitive gap but it's just it's small
it's just an arguably small if you're
looking at the hybrid it's probably also
worth looking at the air-cooled 390x
cards that are about 400 to 420 dollars
and in that instance as we discuss and
analyze in our acs benchmark or
syndicate benchmark 390 acts actually
significantly under performs against the
970 cards and even against them cheaper
970 SSC and that's just an optimization
issue but that changes depending on game
and you can check all of our standalone
independent game benchmarks to learn
more about the value of cards outside of
the 970 s we're comparing directly today
Metro last light char gets a little more
interesting back when we briefly had an
EVGA 970 10 50 megahertz card which was
provided by JP our we ran it through a
few of our then standard bench games and
Metro is one of them the 10 50 megahertz
card here in ml lands at a full 14 point
two percent lower average FPS than the
SSC model price just $40 more and that's
a performance gap that becomes
noticeable that creates more than a 10
FPS swing between the two at 1080p
the hybrid lands at nine point three
percent faster than the 10 50 megahertz
card and at 1440p the swing is the
difference between 50 FPS at 10 50
megahertz 57 FPS at 11 90 megahertz it's
certainly noticeable and at 55 FPS with
the 11 40 megahertz hybrid card so you
are definitely advantaged with those pre
overclocked devices in this game for
sure
moving on to thermals and power the GTX
970 hybrid is now the coolest device on
our bench edging out that on ATT I
hybrid by about two point three seven
Celsius but
makes sense because the 980ti hybrid is
a larger chip and it's hotter it's more
powerful chip as well so it does take
more energy to power runs hotter for
that reason and that's why you see this
gap the 970 hybrid is definitely at the
top of our chart now though for thermal
performance and it's not until we get
into overclocking which is in more
detail in a moment that the 970 hybrid
passes the 980 I hybrid stock thermals
landing at 23 0.72 Celsius still
remarkably low and nothing at all to
worry about even with high OCS as we
achieved but it's it's really just worth
pointing out that the thermals here were
have from the SSC that's it's about a 90
percent performance Delta between the 20
point 5 3 Celsius hybrid in the 54 point
1 5 Celsius SSC it's the 2x cooling gain
and even as we look into overclock
temperatures of these two cards 13 20
megahertz base 15:46 boost on the hybrid
the gap remains 77% versus the as a/c
stock output so there's there's still a
gain here no matter which way you look
at it you're certainly paying for that
though it's a minimum of 50 dollars over
the SSC's cost certainly more for the
lower end cards and whether there's ROI
on that for you as a user depends on
your use cases depends on if you're
cramming it into an SFF build or a
hotter case or a shoebox build in those
instances then certainly the temperature
is advantageous but other than that
unless you're in a particularly warm
ambient environment the performance
Delta is not necessarily something that
you need to spend the extra money on it
just depends on what you're going for
the GTX 970 hybrid at 11:40 megahertz
the stock configuration draws 263 point
5 3 watts which is five point eight six
percent less than the eleven ninety
megahertz 970 SSC card even as we look
to overclocked setups which lands the
hybrid at 13 20 megahertz base and 1546
max clock the liquid cooled card at 279
point four three watts is more efficient
than the 1519 megahertz SSC overclock
at 299 point four nine watts in talking
to EVGA this is primarily a result of
the sses beefier power management setup
but we think it can also be attributed
to power efficiency gains from moving to
liquid for example the reduction of
leakage from capacitors you're losing
less power to inefficiency because of
the overall cooler temperature the
similarly priced MSI r9 390x just give
some perspective here that's a 420
dollar card that draws 416 point 3 watts
which is about 44.94 percent more than
the 970 hybrid and thermals of this
particular 390x are approximately eighty
one point three eight percent higher
than the hybrid and that is a pretty
well cooled card using the MSI's frozer
fan set up moving to overclocking the
GTX 970 hybrid allows a power offset of
ten percent as does the SSC card and we
overclocked and tested both each with
independent tables here so here's the
hybrids table the final resting clock
rate was fifteen forty six megahertz all
totaled and this is the boosted r8 when
under gaming workloads the clock rate as
suggested through basic math one eighty
plus eleven forty was thirteen twenty
megahertz as the base and we left the
memory clock at five hundred megahertz
offset which is where we stopped on most
cars voltage remains one point two one
two throughout the process one point two
and two volts the SSC landed at fifteen
nineteen megahertz a fair bit lower than
the fifteen forty six of the hybrid and
that's even taking into account the
higher pre overclock of that as a C this
produces a swing that shifts the hybrid
into territory of a higher clock rate
and thus a higher average FPS ahead of
the SSC just barely a couple percent we
were unable to clarify the C's memory
very high it seems to get stuck around
three hundred megahertz beyond which
point the drivers would fail and the
hybrid is of our two cards clearly the
superior overclock or in this instance
and this is likely partly attributable
to the advantage thermal management but
can also boil down to things like
binning and the Silicon Lottery
performance puts the hybrid about two
percent ahead of the SSC when it's
overclocked when they're both
overclocked
you can see those charts here or look
more in-depth in the article link in the
description below
so is it worth it is the 970 hybrid
actually worth $400 this is a nice clean
cut as some of the other reviews the
980ti hybrid I was a pretty big advocate
of when it came to reducing those
thermals of the 980ti because a warmer
card in general and you can actually
gain performance from that card that's
set up and it was running 700 bucks
which at the time was about $50 more
than the average 980 I so in that case
it's still a $50 gap but you're just
you're spending so much more that it's
it's a smaller percentage gain in price
so it doesn't feel as bad in this case
you're potentially going from 320 $350
up to 400 that's a much more noticeable
gap so it's harder to defend the price
to jump and I'll read what I wrote in
the review just because I think it sums
things up pretty well for most users we
would recommend a normal air-cooled GTX
970 but we would strongly recommend that
you got a pre overclocked one like
that's a C it doesn't have to be EVGA
there's a lot of other good cards out
there to MSI's mine so many gaming is
basically the same thing as this and
it's the same price so you like how it
looks better than just by that but
plenty of good cards out there issues
MSI get good by EGA they all have cards
that are very comparable and those are
all about $350 this is still 400 it's
clocked a bit lower so you'll have to
overclock to achieve the 1190 megahertz
of most of these 350 dollar cards but
that's really a trivial feat anyone can
do a 50 megahertz offset on this
probably don't even have to increase the
power percentage or the voltage or
anything like that but for most users we
recommend the 350 dollar card just on
the status of price alone even though
the performance is about the same the
thermal performance of this is nearly
two times what this is it dissipates 90%
of the heat so you're ending up in the
20 Celsius range versus forties or
fifties depending on the card and that
is massive so that swings things a bit
that makes it so that if you want a shoe
box set up like a shuttle PC or an SFF
bill with maybe a Silverstone SGO a it
or similar box that's geo-9 in those
cases it would actually make a good deal
of sense to buy something
like this if you're not trying to buy a
high-end 980ti or 980 with liquid you
can buy something like in mine 70 with
liquid and those cases it makes sense
only because of one thing and that's
with the SFF box is you really you're
running hotter case temperatures in
general because you think about it
everything's closer together especially
mitx or m ATX boards so because
everything's closer together the GPU of
the CPU will sort of symbiotically
exchange heat and warm each other up the
whole case warms up ram warms up this is
a big one that people don't think about
the chipset warms up and in those
scenarios outputting through a radiator
like this will drop your thermal
substantially for all neighboring
components and that is worth considering
otherwise you kind of you want to blow
our fan set up because like this blower
fan or the reference blower fan it will
push the heat outside of the case rather
than using the push fans which can
dissipate a lot of the heat up and out
of the sides of the card at which point
it's just going back into the case and
if you're in a tight case recirculates
gets hot not a great thing
so overall the 970 hybrid is the best
overclock or of these two particular
cards that we tested I have not tested
the G one yet it has far superior
thermals any card we've ever tested
except maybe the 980ti hybrid which is
very close couple Celsius and for that
reason this is an impressive setup but
you can still be pretty happy at the 50
Celsius range delta T with an air-cooled
card because that's certainly not a
dangerous temperature so it just depends
on your use case if you are one of those
users who needs the reduced thermals or
you just want them for longevity reasons
then certainly consider the 970 hybrid
it's a good performer and if you can
afford the 50 bucks it's worth it for
those cases if you're a user who's an
average gamer you're never gonna
overclock you're running maybe a mid
tower set up then air is just fine for
you if you're looking specifically at a
970 then any air $350 card with a pre
overclock would be a good consideration
do check our independent game benchmarks
by independent I mean primarily that
they are not reviews of GPUs the reviews
of game performance and see where each
card fall
to figure out if you should buy one or
not so that is the 970 hybrid review
check the link the description for more
information 400 bucks 11 40 megahertz
base easily overclocked overclocked very
high and cools very efficiently a little
bit ugly on the faceplate I'll I'll
admit I don't really talk thermals but I
don't like this faceplate too much but
EVGA has output different face plates
and the fast in the past so hopefully
they do that again
either way though this is just a
faceplate so not a big deal to me
personally so that's all for this one if
