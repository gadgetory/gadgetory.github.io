into metal pots I mean how hard can that
be right that's all it is it's very easy
but it impresses the girls every once we
have a special content piece for the
show this year we've seen a lot of
comments while doing lnto overclocking
and there are two pretty pretty mean
ones one of them is what's the point of
liquid nitrogen overclocking for example
when Joe was on people said you've
wasted your life doing this is well I
guess it's just it's so easy so extreme
overclockers responding to mean comments
before that this video is brought to you
by e BJ's a new audio sound card
engineered by audio note EVGA CEO knows
high quality audio and has begun
bringing sound cards back the new audio
sound card is capable of delivering
hair-raising audio superior to onboard
sound the card includes a line in
headphone line out and Mike in and a
Sony Philips digital interface new audio
also leverages the EVGA specv design
experience has upgradeable op amps and
uses a km premium components for its DAC
and a DC learn more at the link in the
description below eight pack joining me
first
a retired extreme overclockers now
working on a water coin solution on our
chill C on our Channel Joe step on tak a
period hardware aka step on t10 who
really wants to go home and I've asked
him to stay for this stupid kingpin now
and kingpin aka Vince
I guess kingpins one of your real name
at this point on the cards anyway how do
you respond to what's the points of
liquid nitrogen overclocking well the
point of liquid nitrogen overclocking
for me is just a pound the hardware into
submission you know just give it
everything you can and get everything
out of it possible well you can't let
the hardware know that it has the upper
hand no you're really you know bit
whatever hardware it is you've just got
a pound it pound it pound it for every
less mega hurt you do you apply that
same approach to people who post that
kind of comments well I'd like to but I
mean they'll never stand up all they do
is type on my keyboards you know come on
well other than there to get the best
score possible other point is also have
a
stress test for the graphic art or the
motherboards or dislike' CPU so like
when we designed the new hardware like
we don't know what's the actual limit so
when we want to liked it best make the
design the best VRM
or even like PCB layout we will
overclock and that applies even for the
normal overclocking like what a water
cooling and normal air cooling but you
don't cannot put put a push as much
because that you are always limited by
temperature I am with a land to we can
remove that limitation on the
temperature and always makes out like
maximum power maximum voltages and see
what's the weak point and then we can
design better hardware using that
knowledge right so you actually use it
in for people who don't know I guess you
you work at EVGA doing engineering on
like the kb cards right yeah like that's
essentially the full point we research
what the limitations are and improved on
those limitations and then it's become a
available product which you can buy in
an example of the kingpin Kart or dark
serious motherboards from EVGA so does
that that's the work you do there does
it end up getting applied like to a
lower down skew over time yeah but it
takes like extra time like when we find
out the solution it's usually applies
for the general all the designs but
because of the cost and the ski use like
usually we will use maybe like 20% of
improvement for the other end the ski
use and for the best possible units like
dark or kingpin boards then we will use
every single door what is the point of
ln2 overclocking hmm girls its girls
really yes hey I met my wife here
she was a g.skill showgirl really yeah
that's actually pretty legitimate to the
hand room I do it for the girls man it
says to keep Joe off the streets you
know you know that's a good point yeah
it keeps him busy
yeah stop drinking and so on keeps him
keeps him flat-footed on a night you
know gives him something to do before he
goes to bed that's kind of thing I mean
I think on one live stream the other day
wasn't he
CVG dark manual train to camp in or
something can't remember but something
like that yeah so so so out one it's fun
it pushes the industry for two and it
keeps Joe employed Joe will get him next
let's see what he has to say Joe when I
was talking to eight pack he said that
one of the main reasons people are on
that there's no point Allen to
overclocking is because it keeps you
employed otherwise they'd just be
slacking all the time right now he keeps
you off the streets do so so the
comments you've seen it you see that
they're in our streams what is the
points a balance here overclocking well
I remember you were sad said something
about what is the point of gaming what
is the point of doing anything that's
fun you know I mean I like to do stuff
that's fun and I enjoy benching and I'll
probably always bitch so so what it
let's let's do the quick quick top-level
what is it that you find fun about it
then because apparently some people
can't understand it well a lot of people
are very sensitive when it comes to
those things so like I don't know I like
to like just beat other people so I like
to be I mean if there's someone's like
oh I got this score I'm like yeah mine's
better trend between you and eight-pack
he said the reason he likes bench is
because he can pound the hardware into
the crowd basically I like to go full
Hulk with hardware asked in because he
he usually has to fix it right Tim the
other question is its Oren comments I
should say it's easy all you do is pour
Allen's here from one cannon to another
oh I hear that all the time all you have
to do is put ln2 on it and it will
magically overclock itself which is
total BS I mean I don't know that that
one drives me nuts because it's actually
a lot more skill than that I mean
anybody could do on water no like
pouring a method of pouring right
maintaining a temperature knowing how
the GP is gonna like spin up under load
and stuff like that oh yeah you saw just
even before like how much we added like
pour pour pour pour then have to go get
boil and to pour pour pour pour
it takes a lot and then torch it when
you're on the CPU test the GPUs don't
get too cold
oh there's a lot of difference grueling
it's terrible but I loved every minute
of it
even with their normal
working on the own they're like yeah you
can set up like the clocks plus 100 and
then run the benchmark that's easy but
actually to get the best score like
sometimes you have to trade just test
the drivers for like whole week like to
find out the best driver and that's not
even touching them - and then when you
are there and - into that then
everything becomes much more complicated
because now you need to worry about not
having the right settings right voltages
and right time into four
you also need to keep like the manual
and two system and everything like like
when we with demo Dale and Tariq seeing
the Computex demo and even just benching
we're always like that time management
is very important and just that along
make it very hard and I should point out
too that you also do physical Hardware
work to do the overclocking on these
cards you actually have to like assemble
the cards and make sure that the contact
is right not too much not you know too
less otherwise you will kill the hard
way in the first session you try i'm
soldering in you've done like power mods
up and we'll have a separate video on
that i think so the parramatta you get
into into some engineering level work
that's very interesting and is
encouraged by how the overclocking when
we're doing the extreme overclocking
guides like for the kingpin and are
serious I try to document like all these
findings and like five actually user can
apply those settings change them
settings and what will happen and in the
result like how they can get the better
score as they're even running the same
same score same frequency you can get
very different performance you know any
of the extras I'll tell you I'll tell
you that it's very skilled keeping the
right temperatures testing the whole
over hardware been in the whole hardware
making sure it doesn't die
make sure there's no watch on the system
and really fighting for the last few
points you know knowing that you've
maxed out that system it's very much
also like the Formula one cars for
example no one can drive a formal long
car but the everything that's done in
extreme overclocking is then introduced
by the vendors over time into their
everyday products and helps everyone get
the extra performance boost for free
it's straight performance if you're not
paying for it why not you know do it
it's also why you see like some of the
boards PCBs video cards GP or mother
now pushing towards higher quality
veeram designs do and that's a obviously
inspired by the by the elite tier
high-end overclocker over time of passed
on the aspirations for more power more
power more power inner to the individual
motherboard vendors and the vendors have
got back from them over caucus obviously
the marketing that's associated with
having all the world records and the
prestige of winning competitions so it's
a kind of two-way thing product
development and also a prestige thing
and hopefully it helps the gamer to get
more FPS the renderer to get faster and
more hypothetic workloads and so on and
so on yeah all indirectly just through
the research that ends up happening for
overclocking as well yeah yeah
absolutely that yeah yeah I mean
obviously more and more vendors you know
they're all the time trying to gain a
USP and obviously the higher the board
can overclock especially on ambient
conditions which pretty much anyone can
do the more that again market share and
the more they gain reputation and you
can see from the evolution of boards
from when I started doing it where you
have to solve the dip switches onto the
board just to change multipliers to how
now it is so easy to do a basic ambient
overclock without killing something
which in the past you know a wrong
solder everything is dead now this is
all at BIOS level in the men you know
you'd have to start solving so it's it's
actually a broad adoption of
overclocking really and we're just
taking it to the extreme to push the
engineering and to to if you like push
the envelope it's like juggling like
five machetes at once basically right I
mean you have all these different
components you have to kind of real-time
know what they're all doing you have all
the parameters you have the voltage the
temperature it's a lot you got a lot
going on at one time right and you chop
one machete and you kill a card yeah and
then all the machetes start falling so
that is a that's kingpins answer that's
eight packs answer right so that's tins
answer so that's Joe's reason for L&amp;amp;T
overclocking and we'll go ahead and plug
his site to King been cooling calm you
know there's one more thing I want to
get your opinion on this guy just a
Ponzi
you know you know who he is okay so so
what what do you think of that guy he's
alright he's alright alright is it is it
true that without hunt it would be
unemployed pretty much yeah
I think without Ellen to this guy he
he'd be a street dweller for sure like
