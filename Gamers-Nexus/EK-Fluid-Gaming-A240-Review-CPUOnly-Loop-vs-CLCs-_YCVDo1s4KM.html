attempt at bringing open-loop cooling to
market at closed-loop prices this fits
it into an odd market segmentation where
the desire to go open-loop is present
but the funds aren't as such the
company's fluid gaming series resorts to
using aluminum for all parts much like
CLC's do and position zk to battle some
of its own a previous marketing language
that's how did copper over aluminum
marketing challenges aside the company
has successfully managed to bring open
loop solutions to markets at sub $200
starting points making it possible for
enthusiasts to attempt their first
custom loops with relatively low
investment for today's review we're
focusing on just the EK fluid gaming 240
kit which only includes the cpu cooling
solution radiator and coolant mixture
and nothing for GPU blocks before that
this coverage is brought to you by the
core G 21 enclosure from thermal take a
$70 case with 2 4 millimeter thick
tempered glass side panels and a power
supply shroud with top mounted SSDs LEDs
learn more at the link in the
description below so for today's review
we're focusing on whether the e K fluid
gaming kit in the 240 variety makes
sense as an alternative to a CLC this is
looking only at the kit cooling just the
CPU so no GPU kool-aid no monoblock none
of the elements of an open-loop cooler
that make it an open-loop cooler because
the ek ultimately does sell this kit as
I stand alone at 240 cooler that you can
buy in stick on just the CPU the
advantage being you can expand it later
on like 90% of the CLC's on the market
so because of that advantage obviously
you've got options of getting into
aluminum GPU blocks or mono blocks or
other cooling solutions that ek provides
except in the fluid gaming series so
it's got to be all aluminum that way
there's no galvanic corrosion or
anything like that when mixing metals
and this paints ek into an interesting
market segment where there's really no
competition in terms of being a cheap
open-loop cooler that is made by a brand
backing it that has a good reputation so
we're focusing just on the 240s
performance including its fans
versus all the CLC's pretty much on the
market that are mainstream Coursera's
ndx tees all the others and then perhaps
later at some indeterminate point in the
future we'll look into expanding the
loop into open loop testing properly
open loop testing for example against
other wealth even just just with GPU
blocks basically is what we'd be looking
at at that point so yeah focusing on
this one thing today with the idea is
that you can expand later but you can
still buy it standalone the 240 kit only
is a $160 cost so that's just the 240
radiator the pump which is over here the
block and the tubing required to make it
work but it's a complete kit it's good
to go out of box now normally we don't
speak too much about experienced
personal experiences or preferences or
anything like that in these types of
reviews this one I think it's a little
necessary because this kit is billed
toward filling a first time customer
builder market and unlike a lot of the
other reviewers I don't really focus on
open loops so I entered this with very
little experience with open loops
hopefully that means I can provide you a
different perspective my perspective
obviously we have the data driven
elements which we'll get to in a moment
but my perspective what the building
process was that this was pretty easy to
work with we actually did it on streem
for the most part half the build was
done off stream but it is fairly easy to
work with the instructions are okay what
they don't they don't elaborate in the
first version anyway a couple of things
like you should keep pouring with pump
cap off as it's filling the loop for
example that wasn't really explicitly
detailed there but it should have been
over although it's not hard to get into
but you will need more than just the
instruction manual to really make sure
you get it right if you're if you're
going to be a little neurotic about it
you probably want to look around for
other tutorials because eks doesn't
cover a whole lot of the process beyond
the very basics of what can be covered
in five steps on five pages that are
this size so more instruction would be
good what I on that front
EK if you're listening I would recommend
making your own video
and then just uploading it and putting a
QR code in there or a link and then
people can get some more detail that way
but it went together pretty easily it's
easy to expand it is a soft tubing so
it's not gonna look as good as a lot of
the open loops you've seen out there but
if you're a first time builder for an
open loop it's not a bad entry-level
product in terms of price performance is
a different question we'll get into that
now to quickly go over prices first the
240 unit were reviewing today costs 160
dollars again that's basically just a
CPU cooler except you can expand it if
you want the single 120-millimeter
option is 150 dollars and really not at
all worth it it's $10 more to get
something a lot better the GTX 10 series
block included with the 240 kit cost
$240 and that's a pretty cheap open-loop
solution that covers two core components
or to give some perspective the corsair
h 100 ib to a 240 millimeter closed-loop
cooler is available at 110 dollars with
the kraken X 52 somewhere in the 140 to
150 range depending on which vendor
you're buying from for testing methods
and the platform use as always check the
article linked in the description below
it's get additional information on what
was done here let's start with CPU
torture testing and then move into noise
normalized tests at 40 DB a fixed noise
output the first round of tests is
conducted with out of box settings and
fans using Mac's pump and fan speeds the
ek fluid gamer 240 millimeter kit
cooling only the CPU performs at 37.4 6
degrees Celsius over ambient that's a
delta T value again versus ambient which
positions the 1700 rpm ek kit
effectively tied with the NZXT kraken X
52 at 2100 rpm for perspective the ek
kit produces about 41 to 40 DBA worth of
noise in this configuration whereas the
X 52 CLC produces about 50 DBA in this
configuration we have a noise floor of
26 in this scenario that's definitely a
advantage for the ek fans which is
something we can show by swapping fans
off the ek kit and trading them for CLC
fans if momentarily but other tests
positioned the ek fluid gaming kit about
2 degrees Celsius cooler than low rpm
LZ 280 coolers where we ran the
competitively priced 130 EVGA units with
a 1050 rpm fan setup resulting in a 37
point 1 DBA output
this makes EVGA CLC 280 effectively as
cool as the EK fluid gaming CPU only
cooler when noise matched but with
slightly lower noise levels and a lower
price that said EVGA s kit is only
usable for one component whereas eks
offers a separate pump and open-loop
capabilities for expansion into GPU or
mono block cooling but in favor of EVGA
you can ramp the fans up a lot faster
and get more single components cooling
potential out of that stock unit than
with ek so there are trade-offs either
way you go the major bonus for ek is
argument of course is that you can
expand it into open-loop and you should
if you're buying one of these anyway if
you're just trying to cool one component
and we're wondering if ek is pump and
rad solution would do a better job than
a CLC the answer is generally no and
that's because with the CLC's they come
in cheaper and you can kind of tune the
fans as needed though the fans on ek is
unit are actually pretty nice the kraken
X 62 at 10:50 rpm also produces
effectively the same thermal results as
the ek fluid gaming 240 kit at thirty
seven point one versus thirty seven
point five degrees Celsius within our
variants X 62 s noise levels at this rpm
measure at around 37 DBA also though the
X 62 does tend to be expensive
it's 157 dollars at the time of writing
that's also for a 280 moment your cooler
with a ton of RGB to be fair but not
everyone wants that just as a standalone
CPU cooler there's really no thermal
benefit to e case fluid gaming 240 over
the alternatives this needs to be used
in an open loop to actually offer value
there is really no value if you're
planning to buy this and use it as a
single component cooler like for your
CPU and if you want to use it for the
GPU you might as well make your own
hybrid we ran one test with course
there's H 100 Ivy to fans on the e K
fluid gaming 240 just to see how good
their fans are we measured performance
at 36 Celsius Delta t load for the
coarser H 100 Ivy - with corsair h100
ib2
max 2500 rpm with the EK fluid gaming
kit using Corsairs fans measuring at 35
0.74 degrees Celsius so again
36 degrees versus thirty five point
seven four this is under the same load
and RPM with the same fan so we're
within margin of error for our own
measurement equipment and testing so we
can declare these as functionally
equivalent any advantage that the a 240
has as a standalone cooler is derived
from the Vardar fans so that it makes
the most sense to noise normalize at 40
DBA and run some more tests normalizing
the RPM to fit a 40 DBA output the ek
fluid gaming kit ends up running at
about 90 percent for each fan or roughly
sixteen eighty rpm with our fans and
sustaining a temperature of thirty nine
point nine degrees Celsius delta T over
ambient this positions the ek kit as a
better option than the ex 42 with a 40
DB a 1310 rpm fan Mesrine at forty two
point four degrees Celsius for the X 42
or a couple degrees warmer than what
we're seeing here on ek is unit this is
worse than the larger radiator is at 40
DBA as you'd expect like the 280
millimeter H 115 I and the 280 military
NZXT crack and X 62 both of which
outperform the ek kit technically
speaking in terms of noise normalized
thermals but the ek kit is 240 as
compared more appropriately to the
Corsair H 100 IB 2 which is a 240
millimeter radiator like ek fluid gaming
kit we can see that the ek stock fans
are actually pretty good though again if
you swap them they'd be basically the
same performance this is where that
price difference is between the ek kit
may each 100 be - it's primarily in the
standalone pump which has it cost the
tubes but also in the fans it's not a
terrible thermal deficit for Corsair but
certainly a measurable one Corsair
operates about 2 degrees Celsius warmer
on average at around 42 degrees Celsius
when running at 40 DBA that's not enough
to spend more money for on the ek kit if
you're using it only to cool the CPU but
enough to say that ek has got better
fans included in its solution so if you
were wondering if the ek a 240 solution
for only the CPU is better than a CLC
stand-alone the answer is no not really
it's not better in terms of price in
most cases it's not better in terms of
thermals in most like 90% of cases noise
it's okay it's actually got some pretty
good fans on the kit but I mean there's
no reason to buy this setup stand alone
unless you're planning to expand it
that's why you buy it so I will I'll
speak to the the entry-level open-loop
Builder argument for this kit if you
want something that's really easy to
order the box open it all the parts are
there so you don't have to look around
for them you're not going to
accidentally forget to order something
or not know you need something then the
box with this will include all those
parts it'll include some basic if
lacking instructions but you can
definitely get through it and you'll be
able to build a loop and if it's your
first custom loop this is a pretty good
starting point that said personally
speaking here I do tend to prefer
spending more money to buy something
once than spending last money to get
something that will get me started but I
want to replace in a year that's not to
say you have to do that this kit is
plenty good especially once we start
getting into expanding with a GPU for
example we're looking into that
it's not on the roadmap immediately
because we have coffee leak and other
things but if you're planning to expand
the kit it's got options for you and
that's the main reason to buy this over
a CLC if you just want to cool the CPU
once again don't bother
but for expansion there are options for
you but the question again becomes once
you're spending $240 for the 240 plus
the GPU block kit do you want to
consider just spending a bit more to
start getting into the sort of more
customizable the better looking
solutions out there because open loops I
think for a lot of people are about
looks you don't really get looks with
this you get looks with the with heart
tubing and stuff I it's a lot more
difficult to do stuff that takes more
time and experience so if you don't have
any of that time or experience then it's
a good starting point again but if you
feel like learning and you can throw
away some tubes in the process or you
can wait a little bit longer as you work
through the early learning periods then
I'd say skip this save the money add
another 1 to 200 bucks
and try and start the next tier higher
doesn't need to be crazy but that's just
one way to look at it that's the way I
would look at it as for a recap here as
a standalone CPU only cooling solution
don't bother as a an expandable solution
starting with the CPU and expanding
later into the GPU definitely look into
this we'll be looking at the GPU cooling
more but we've already done plenty of
hybrid tests and obviously it's always
just way better than air cooling in
terms of thermals and noise and in terms
of noise these fans are pretty damn good
they're better than most stock fans that
are included with CL CS they're not the
best fans though but they're again
they're pretty damn good so ek has done
an interesting thing here where they
have a pretty good product but one of
the skis actually two of the skis make
zero sense except for as expansion
options and the rest of its really just
not bad it's just they have a major
marketing challenge which is partly
fighting their own years worth of
marketing in favor of their existing
copper lines to say that hey actually
about that stuff we said about copper
and aluminum previously aluminum is
actually pretty good so they have to
fight that uphill battle but yeah it's
it's not a bad product I'm certainly
happy to see affordable open-loop parts
coming out of a vendor that has some
gravitas in the industry so good to see
overall but yeah don't buy it for
standalone single component cooling is
basically the conclusion but definitely
look into it for expanding options and
for its ease of installation because
they make it pretty straightforward for
the most part so thank you for watching
