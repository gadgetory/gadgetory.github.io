don't really simulate like full body and
that's right they put it's a ragdoll
then it falls down at most the time it's
animation group right that's right so
then the question is how you're gonna do
you got to basically blend between
animation stuff and then rag doll as
well when you're in Sergi you got to do
more of it like you impact something to
the side grain you got to keep the
angular momentum exactly right so that
that's the heart of thing to get rid of
actually thank Allah momentum yes you
can stop for dinner tonight I've invited
Chuck who's the head of real phonic I
invited him out to dinner
excellent let's break it down break it
down let's figure out how to know cuz
like like literally right if you're like
in zero-g you do enough ish I'll start
you'll stop moving this way slowly right
right fun packed country that but you
can you can speed it up or slow it down
head question but you can't stop the
rotate you can't stop the actual
momentum and so one of one of the fun
things do to something in zero-g is you
you hold them out into the center of a
room alright and you let go of them yeah
then they can't get out because you
can't swim
right you're stuck because your momentum
is sitting still spinning this way can I
not do a captain move with my buddy and
kind of my like my angler and angler
inertia so in it in a way right no you
can you can do a little bit the cat move
you know how a cat can go from upside
down and middle switch so you actually
can do a direction facing change but you
cannot change your momentum without next
without an external force and so it's
actually interesting problem because
inevitably so if I think in the movie
Ender's Game if I'm moving if I'm
spinning this way slowly and I twist to
go the other way what happens you'll
still be your the your center of gravity
will still keep going the same direction
and that's why the Ender's Game thing
the part where you you really can't do
it very well is when you when we launch
if you go like to go across the way it
is effectively impossible not to have a
little bit of unintended angular
momentum yeah alright and so by the time
you get to the other end you're gonna be
hurt unless yet unless you basically
have a jetpack unless you ever eat it
unless you have some countermeasures
like you could take by the way yeah
we've got like
and about them as a there's a laser
grapple thing so on your gun
you can fire out and it'll fire a beam
out and you could pull it so you
basically and when you fire it though it
should kick you back including if it's
not at your center of gravity what I
don't know is it's a its sense of it's
like think of it like a track to be so
it fires a beam out to grapple onto the
beam not it's not enough no it's not a
rope yeah yeah no it's the answer beam
and then it pulls you towards it are you
basically yeah we've ran like that
alright so we're just gonna pull Ritchie
up on stage tomorrow okay we don't we
haven't got the code yet but if we got
Richard for you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
