now at CES 2018 and they have a sort of
interesting set of components here in
this build so this is one of their luck
species I wanted to call attention to a
fan text waterblock in here and also the
thermal take case the p90 so the
waterblock is particularly interesting
this was announced in December and
doesn't come out until next month this
is an r1 or r2 20 there's also an r1 60
they are glacier blocks they're called
and it can be used to more or less
passively cool low TDP components so
that's the interesting aspect of it
before that this video is brought to you
by Leon Lee and their 550 X and 330
cases the 550 X is a $180 mid tower case
with tempered glass on all panels it's
got three RGB LED fans positioned in the
front each of which has a metal frame
housing and an open interior design if
you prefer a cheaper option the 330 is
$100 and comes without fans and as what
we recommended it most heavily in one of
our recent case reviews learn more at
the link in the description below
looking at it from that perspective the
this is a 220 I believe from what I've
been told they're rated based on the
size and it comes with a bracket so that
you can mount it in front of radiators
or other fans in the systems for 120 140
and the idea being that you don't need
active cooling on the block itself but
you could just put it in the way of
other airflow that you already have in
the case which would obviously help with
reducing noise so you don't have as many
fans so kind of interesting from that
perspective it's lower TDP support only
because you are using a much smaller
surface area you don't have active
cooling built into the device the pumps
a bit small although it does support DDC
pumps if you wanted to use that and then
all of the dissipation takes place on
the back side where they have some
aluminum fins and in this case they're
contacting with mostly the power supply
but there are a couple of exposed fins
that we can show and b-roll so the air
flow going over that is what would
handle your dissipation aspect of of the
heat sinking and that's done just
through other fans in the system as
discussed
so pretty cool it's it's a bit different
the blocks from fantex are priced at I
think 94 the smaller
110 for the larger 220 which is what's
on here if you're building some kind of
low TDP home theater PC that doesn't do
much other than play videos you could
use something like this and end up with
a much quieter configuration overall so
I wanted to call attention to that cyber
power is using it here in their locked
system which is also using the
Thermaltake p90 we talked about this
when it was first announced we haven't
really showed it in person yet
I believe it's p90 because it's just a
90 degree Bend we've shown the P the P 3
and the P 5 in the past so it's it's the
same idea it is still wall mountable
surprisingly despite its mass and it's
just a showcase for conventions and
things like I mean like we see here
today kind of interesting with the these
rx SPC chromed tubes which have kind of
a neat juxtaposition with the support
bars to the glass I know other than that
we'll look at more or Thermaltake stuff
soon at CES but yeah fantex block block
is kind of neat and comes out February
2018 s next month and then if you're
interested in the system pre-built
itself without doing any other working
check-out CyberPower will link them in
the description below as well subscribe
for more as always you get a patreon.com
slash gamers Nexus tops that directly
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
