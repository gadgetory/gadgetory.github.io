next to snot net and I am here to tell
you about so taks new 980 extreme
overclocking video card mostly I'm here
to tell you not to buy this thing this
one is better if you don't know what
this is it's the reference gtx 980 and
that might sound a little crazy so let's
get into that first of all the specs
this thing is slightly overclocked
before you receive it it has a 13 93
megahertz boost clock whereas the stock
card has 12 16 megahertz more or less
that's not really something that matters
in the real world where reality is
because you can overclock the reference
part to this which is about 170
megahertz in about 50 seconds or less if
you're you've never done it before
that's probably how long it would take
so why do I get this well in theory you
can overclock this even higher still
higher than the pre overclock that they
ship it at because first of all the GM
204 that's the GPU in here the
semiconductor that Nvidia makes the one
that is in the GTX 980 the GM 204 is
binned out by ZOTAC they are selecting a
higher quality chip to put in the 980
extreme which is a limited edition run
so because they're selecting a higher
quality chip in theory the ASIC quality
is higher so in theory you can overclock
higher because it's got better tolerance
for higher frequencies and voltages
which are what you are playing with when
you're overclocking so it should be
pretty good but it's also got an
aftermarket cooler this is probably the
only thing that is legitimately well
designed on this video card just so you
know other than stuff that's supplied by
Nvidia obviously so this is using a
single intake man in the center with two
exhaust fans flanking on the left and
right and what that does is basically it
pushes the air straight down onto the
GPU the exhaust fans that pull that air
push it out the sides out of the back at
the top all of those places so that the
fins are cooled adequately and there's
no there's no stagnant air getting stuck
in there from a tripl intake setup which
has happened in the past so this should
cool it down better which means you can
overclock higher means you can over
volts higher because it's not going to
get as high
not gonna shut down for for thermal
reasons now in addition to this it's got
to 8-pin power intakes whereas the input
for the gtx 980 reference is two six
pins that gives us a lot more overhead
this thing can push something like 435
watt TDP that's the maximum allowed by
the GM 204 from what ZOTAC told us the
two 8-pin intakes will allow for at
least 400 watts of power which means we
can push this thing a higher in
frequency and push it higher in voltage
because it's got more power to eat from
in terms of the supply before it needs
to throttle back on the clocks further
the GTX 980 extreme biotech has this
marketing module as I call it is called
OC plus and affectionately has many
other names using other mathematical
symbols like - and OC plus is a USB
connected it connects straight to a
micro USB which would be slightly larger
than your phone charger connects it to
one of those plug that into your
motherboard USB IO panel slot that you
always plug your USB 2.0 IO into and
then it's supposed to read all the
voltages and everything straight into
the computer into something into their
software called firestorm so here's the
thing if you've overclocked cards before
you might be wondering the same thing I
was which was why can't I do that anyway
doesn't doesn't windows already know by
nature of these sensors in the GPU by
nature of the thermal probes by nature
of all these things that it's checking
to the talking communicating went
through the CPU to Windows doesn't it
know what the voltage is doesn't it know
what the clocks are how else would
harbour monitor house with GPUs II know
all of the settings on your card when it
doesn't have one of these USB modules
because most video cards do not have one
and I also attack that and they said
that it is required for better control
of the voltage so that's what we were
told and we'll get more into that in a
moment as you can tell I am very fond of
this tool called fired
so that's sort of the overview of this
card now it technically has other
marketing features like power boost
which is a fancy name for solid
capacitors that are covered by a piece
of metal to make it look cooler and as
little power boost on it and then when
you install the video card that where
power boost is upside down so that's a
cool feature I guess it also has red and
green LEDs that you can toggle on and
off but you can't change the color of it
turns green when it's idle red when it's
under load
they are also installed on the underside
so all the light goes down where you
can't see it especially if you've got a
case with a side panel that cuts off the
bottom part of the panel the window
rather because there's nothing to see
there so it's great design and I'm very
excited about it
there should be LEDs in the back plate
now this is I should mention does have a
backplate just like the reference gtx
980 that is something nvidia is doing
standard now with all of their 980 cards
ZOTAC has copied this design and
modified it slightly to make theirs it
look like carbon fiber it's still a
backplate though and offers that extra
support which is needed because the
video card takes up two-and-a-half
expansion slots that means it's pretty
big so if you want to use two slots for
PCI Express and then one underneath it
for video capture for a sound card for
really anything that would normally go
on that PCIe x16
sixteen or eight slots you're gonna have
trouble because it's not gonna fit
because this is gigantic and also it
might get slightly suffocated for air
depending on how big that card is or at
least the exhaust will be partially
covered up if nothing else and so tech
calls there are more exo-armor it
doesn't have the removable backplate
like the reference one does the
reference one has a very small slot up
here that you can remove it for SLI so
that the sli configurations can breathe
better the zotac does not do that
because there's it's different they
strayed from the reference design quite
a bit they actually have a custom PCB
this thing goes up very high not only is
it fat it's pretty tall too so it's
still kind of fit in basically every
case more or less
I won't I won't include many ITX cases
and that no promises still fits
but this kicks up so high that it would
potentially become a concern for things
like an SLI bridge and I tested this the
SLI bridge fits okay in terms of this
height does not fit okay in terms of
this height if you have a triple SLI
bridge that bleeds over so you need to
get something that's smaller and more
compact or you could just not buy this
video card and especially not two of
them so um the the card is fully
detailed now we can talk about why it's
getting such a bad rap and is the butt
of many jokes in this video this thing
was supposed to be the overclocking car
card not card that would be pretty cool
though and I would like review samples
of those this is supposed to be an
overclocking video card that was going
to end all overclocking video cards when
it comes to air cooling it was very
heavily marketed as such it has such
promise with the cooler and really
sounded good on paper the stock clock is
pretty high it's got this fancy PWM
whatever module that's supposed to do
special stuff that didn't do those
things but it sounded like it would when
we first heard about it and really it
should overclock and it were volts very
high because it's got these two eight
pin power intakes or inputs I should say
so it can draw more power you can
sustain a higher voltage and thus a
higher clock none of that happened what
happened is I plug this thing in I
benchmarked it then I started
overclocking it and their fire storm
saucer broke several times so I started
using an EVGA precision an afterburner
by MSI those worked a little bit better
but I found out I couldn't over volt
beyond 1212 millivolts or 1.2 1 2 volts
the stock card so you know this thing
right here from Nvidia is cable over
vaulting up to 1.25 6 volts and that
extra that extra point 0 3 ish volts is
actually huge that is a gigantic
different
and it makes the difference between a
high sustained overclock and sort of a
mediocre boring overclock closer than
the 1500 megahertz range and that's
exactly what happened and the reason the
voltage is locked is twofold first of
all we we assumed my team assumed that
it was a bios issue a B bios issue
I told ZOTAC I gave them two weeks I
said fixed by us make it so that the
voltage is unlock so we can push one
point two five six volts at a bare
minimum if not more because this thing
should be able to handle more because it
looks pretty solid in terms of design
but looks aren't everything
and they came back and said no it's a
software issue it's because of our
firestorm software here try this and
they gave me a different version of
firestorm let's slow that down
if you've ever overclocked hardware it
is not the hardware that is dependent on
the software the hardware will do
basically whatever you tality within the
the hard limits set in BIOS that's
pretty important to know the software if
this thing could push 1.25 whatever
volts or higher precision should be able
to do it
afterburner should be able to do it
firestorm whatever that I guess should
be able to do it but they can't and
firestorm can only do it if you've got
this plugged in and none of the other
software can do it if you have this USB
thing plugged in even though reference
can so it's almost like DRM it's sort of
like an iPod of being forced to use
iTunes in order to overclock and that
goes over to and harness a listen to
music and this being forced to use
firestorm to overclock is sort of
comical because it goes against
everything overclockers stand for they
are hackers by nature they want to use
whatever software they want to use and
because this module doesn't actually add
any functionality in terms of things you
can tweak except well you'll see in the
article it doesn't really add very much
all it does is unlock something that you
can already do with every other video
card on the market normally through
whatever software you want to use so
that's sort of annoying and that's
part one of why this thing is limited to
one point two one two votes and if you
had the special press only version of
the software one point two five six and
that will be distributed to handpick to
overclockers so I guess they you're not
trusted to do it if you're not special
the second reason this can't over volts
very high and is stuck is because the
BRM is bad it is my very strong
speculation based on facts and sources
that the vrm in this was selected
perhaps before the GTX 980 spec was
revealed by Nvidia maybe that's just my
really strong speculation so if it was
picked before the spec was released by
an Nvidia ZOTAC maybe bargained for a
little bit more or less than what
happened in reality the result is a vrm
that connect cannot handle the stock
reference over voltage of one point two
five six volts instead it's pretty stuck
to one point two volts and be BIOS will
tell you that they have not updated B
BIOS as I sort of demanded because the
hardware can't handle it because the vrm
is bad because the pita pwm is a very
drm like in nature and probably bad and
so we're limited we're limited in what
we can over volt and less limit how we
can overclock and those limits are shown
in gpu-z which is the standard tool for
third-party checking of specifications
on a video card it shows in gpu-z
because gpu-z will not report a higher
voltage than 1.2 volts on this and
talking to ZOTAC they said you need to
use firestorm to see the voltage
accurately because v bios is limited to
1.2 volts and we're using this OC plus
whatever the by put bypassed the v ID
and bios and push higher voltage but
every tool I've used including firestorm
seems to say this cut stuck at one point
to firestorm in fact is worse than that
because half the time it doesn't even
apply though overvoltage I asked it to
apply other times it doesn't report
voltage at all it says zero volts which
hopefully that's not happening
that'd be sort of like having a zero BPM
heart rate and it also says you're a
lots half the time so firestorm weather
everything they said can be true that's
fine all of that can be true about the
VI D V by us all of that perfectly true
whatever it's just to say it is it
doesn't matter because I can't trust
firestorm to tell me anything accurate
about this video card and when I test it
in games and when I use tools to log the
boost clock it can't push higher than a
reference card that I spent maybe an
hour doing a hard overclock on and I
spent far more time on this a few days
up to a week perhaps I'd rather not
think about it but the GTX 980 reference
getting into the numbers forget all this
this thing 980 reference from Nvidia
that I've tested already can overclock
to fifteen sixty point three megahertz
boost that is the boost clock with
that's a 295 megahertz offset from base
base is something like eleven twenty six
on this and twelve sixteen boost so
quite a big offset to be able to push
fifteen sixty that's stable that's with
a 30-something millivolt over voltage
and that voltage is applied correctly
that makes it run at one point two five
volts which is the maximum voltage of
the reference card and it cools
reasonably it's in the 50s or something
after subtracting for ambient a little
bit lower but it's in that area so it
cools well enough now this cooler would
be much better but still that's that's
sort of where it stands the memory
overclock I think I pushed about 400
megahertz memory overclock other
websites have done closer to 800 that
really wasn't my concern I was more
interested in the boost clock anyway and
this thing though I should note with Max
while overclocking you use power percent
target or power target percent rather
when you're overclocking the reference
card can go to 125 percent of TDP of
being the multiplication so 125 percent
times TDP which is like 170 ish more or
less that means it can take
effectively 25% more watts from base
that it can then apply to your over
voltage in your clock so you can obtain
sustain and run stabili the higher
clocks so that's a very quick rundown on
Maxwell overclocking this thing can go
to 111 percent TDP and it is using I got
it up to 1500 and like 20 megahertz
somewhat stable with some texture
flickering and blues blue flickering on
the screen which any overclockers would
be familiar with through fire strike the
benchmarking software so it's about 40
megahertz lower than what I did on
reference it cost $60 more it runs maybe
five to ten degrees cooler Celsius
that's somewhat substantial but it can
overclock as high so why and $60 more
why you'd be better off buying the asus
strix or EVGA is cards or waiting on
kingpin or even like a messiah has some
good cards
there are a lot gigabyte gigabytes g1
can do a much higher voltage it can do
like 1 point something and saying one
point four one point six something like
that it can sustain a way higher
overclock way higher over voltage why
would you buy this it's $20 more to get
something insanely better and with
really a pretty similar cooler setup
unlike the aftermarket cooler so that's
sort of the rundown on this you've seen
all the charts by now running through
the video I've just kind of been popping
them up over my face
so that you can see the benchmarks check
the link in the description below to see
the full details where I talk about all
the story leading up to now all my
complaints and emails and Skype messages
I sent this out attack their us
marketing team is fantastic I want to
thank them for tolerating my insistence
that this video card should be much
better and does not and thank them for
pushing all of my complaints to the PM
team which failed to deliver so that is
these are gtx 980 extreme it should have
put them on the map it sadly did not I
hope I sincerely am saddened by this and
I hope that next time they can do better
if there is a next time for an
overclocking card please do not buy this
please buy something like a gigabyte g1
instead or really anything at all is
Asus Strix the reference card this thin
$550 overclocks better
I would not recommend running this at
the 15 60 megahertz overclock I did 24/7
it's probably not too good for the cards
health if you're an overclocker you
don't care about the cards house you
know that it won't die before you
replace it with a new Toyota overclock
anyway but do be careful how hard you
push these things because even this one
at a higher overclock like that 15 21 I
was running with 111 % TDP that's gonna
start beating up this is the silicon
pretty quickly and wear it out so that
is the 980 extreme I'm sorry I could not
bury you better news but hopefully I
saved you some money check out our links
and articles and all that stuff to learn
more about this video card why it failed
and what other companies can learn about
it and I will see you all next time
