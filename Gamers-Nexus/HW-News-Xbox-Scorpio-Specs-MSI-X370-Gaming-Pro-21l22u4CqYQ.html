with launch tomorrow we've got a recap
of the news from the last week in the
tech field of note some of the items
were talking about today include the
Microsoft Xbox Scorpio news as looked
into by digital foundry we have a couple
of items from Asus including
overclocking East boards and then MSI
has got a new X 370 gaming pro board
added to the amp or lineup before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by the 1080 FC which has a new
MSRP that is it lowered with the launch
of the 1080 TI series at 1080 and 1060
SC cards come with for honor or Ghost
Recon wildlands which you can choose
that check out learn more at the link in
the description below Microsoft's mid
generation console release the scorpio
is our first news item for today so far
what we know about this is that first of
all it should be arriving by a holiday
of this year so it's not too far off at
this point and then in the interview is
done with Eurogamer digital foundry and
elsewhere
it looks like the Scorpio will be using
a 16 nanometer FinFET process and that's
still going to be an 8 core Jaguar chip
along with 4 TCU's from the Radeon Group
and those will be clocked at 11 72
megahertz refined Jaguar SOC will run
eight cores using x86 architecture
clocked at 2.3 gigahertz and working
alongside the 40 custom Radeon compute
units it looks like the console should
have about 6 teraflops of compute power
which puts it somewhere around an R X
480 in terms of memory the scorpio also
gets an upgrade to 12 gigabytes of gddr5
shared memory that is running on a
384-bit bus and that's capable of about
326 gigabytes per second of bandwidth
beyond that it looks like the theta is
basically geared towards 4k support as
both for all of these mid generation
console releases have been thus far so
it's looking like 4k is kind of their
marketing point 4k UHD blu-ray is
possible they showed a demo with forza
running at 4k theoretically 60fps as for
how that 4k is being achieved we're not
100% sure yet if it's anything like
it'll probably depend on the game more
than anything whether they're using
checkerboard rendering or other
rendering techniques to permit the 4k
output
but other than that the only thing left
of note is that the Scorpio will be
using a vapor chamber for its cooling
solution and then just a standard blower
fan at least from what we've seen so far
so that will be interesting to tear into
if we're able to get our hands on one
everything else is that is expected it
does have an internal power supply it's
still compatible with the Xbox one s and
all the other current gen Xbox games and
everything should remain more or less
inter compatible which is an interesting
thing with these mid generation launches
because all you're really gaining are
these increases in resolution because
the game developers if they're going to
retain compatibility on all of the
current iterations of the console from
Microsoft or from Sony that means they
can't just push things like polycount
they've got a push resolution as an
option because it's a lot easier to
upscale then to create multiple versions
of your game with different visual
fidelity and graphics settings so that's
what we're looking at for the Xbox
Scorpio and let's do some where around
fall of 2017 back on am for news at
which we're not going to be able to
escape for a while because they m4 is
active and there's a lot of stuff going
on with rise and especially our 5ms I
just added its ex 370 gaming the pro
motherboard to the amp or lineup and
this is sort of like a cheaper version
of the gaming Pro carbon the RGB board
we've looked at the Intel version
there's also stuff on the nd side so the
gaming pro the cheaper version of that
it is running what looks to be two pcie
3.0 slots wired as x16 to the cpu and
then one additional PCIe x16 slot for
the other devices a ICS and things like
that storage options include at 6 SATA 3
ports 1 m dot 2 slots and that does
permit the 32 gigabits per second
boosted performance which of course you
are limited more by the storage device
at that point not the storage interface
and beyond that instead of RGB lighting
that they're using static red LEDs so
kind of like the keyboard market or you
can buy a fixed LED for cheaper that's
what we're doing on motherboards now
apparently because RGB LEDs add a bit
the cost and not everyone wants them but
if you still want LEDs they're kind of
do it anyway
these are controllable through the
mystic software that MSI ships with its
motherboards that
that things that are compatible with
mystic for synchronizing the lighting
will be compatible with this motherboard
as well though you're limited to just
red and connectivity you're looking at
two USB 3.1 ports for the gaming pro
non-carbon one of them is Type C which
is cool news
there are VR boosts USB ports we'll see
if there's actually do anything in our
new VR testing and then the usual HDMI
and DVI D that board should be available
sometime this month in April for around
$150 which rounds out the x-37 the
market pretty well because most the
stuff we're looking at so far is sort of
200 plus range so 154 actually 70 that's
not a bad spot for those to fit in right
now the two storage news items here next
transcend and a data both have new and
two SSDs transcend has a new PCIe m2 SSD
this one is running 3d mlc nand and it
is based on nvm e 1.2 for the interface
of m2 2280 form factor this is currently
speculated to have an SMI or silicon of
motion controller and alongside that
will have micron components as well
that's not confirmed but that's what it
looks like right now in terms of
advertised read/write speed transcend is
suggesting that they'll be able to do a
sequential readwrite respectively of 2.5
gigabytes per second and 1.1 gigabytes
per second of course the more
interesting thing is what is the 4k
random look like especially at those
lower key depths like QD 1 to 4 so
that's what you'll be seeing in normal
windows or application performance for
the most part this also uses some thing
of a pseudo SLC cache which is another
major challenge in SSD benchmarking by
the way that we've discovered somewhat
in just in the past few months where SLC
caching if you're using traditional
benchmark tools a lot of times they will
flood the cache in a way that doesn't
happen in real life and the cache
doesn't have time to purge and recover
so over time you'll see numbers that if
you plot them just drop really hard
that's not necessarily representative of
real performance so that's kind of an
interesting side note where SLC caching
on SSDs adds a lot of new challenges for
SSD benchmarking hence the renewed focus
on latency testing kinda like
for enzyme testing with FPS so
transcends got their new device it is
the MTE 850 series and that's pretty
much all the specs we have other than
128 256 and 512 gigabytes for the
capacities also shipping 128 to z6 and
512 gigabyte devices is a data and
that's for their new xpg SX 7000 series
gotta have lots of X's and cool letters
and numbers in there otherwise it's not
marketable to gamers that is going to be
an m2 Drive MT 2288 form factor as well
we don't know who the maker of the NAND
is just yet it is probably well it's
it's an SMI controller so it is silicon
motion just like the transcend one looks
like it will be that's using the nvme
1.2 protocol over m2 for the interface
as previously stated and other than that
it looks like more DRAM pseudo SLC
caching go on going on and advertise
performance is not too far from
transcends it's looking like for the 512
gigabyte model of the a data drive their
advertising 1800 megabytes per second
sequential read and then for the
sequential writes that's the looking at
850 megabytes per second again for the
flagship 512 price and availability is
not known yet but they are going to be
offering a five-year warranty on that
device these from Asus this week
includes one just kind of a side note
overclocking eSports which seems kind of
potentially fun for a lot of people even
outside of the hardcore overclock scene
where you form a team and do overclock
and submit your results to different to
the website and then just ranked teams
versus the other team so that should be
fun to look into and follow as it gets
going they also have their new ROG
Ariane network adapter so that is going
to be an add-in card adapter and it will
support 10 gigabit per second network
speeds so you plug that into your PCIe
slot it runs on an x-force lot and also
hosts a full sized heatsink which will
really be not maybe necessary but
certainly desirable for a 10 gigabit
switch if you are actually using 10
gigabit per second networking and have
compatible switches in between that will
be compatible with slower network speed
so if you're running five gigabits or
2.5 or something like that you will have
compatibility
the availability looks like sometime
later this month and basically this is
something you should be interested in if
you're doing any sort of intra network
transfers between multiple machines so
we would do that for our media
production for example where you might
move large files from one machine to the
other on the same network internally
over LAN so these cars will be
potentially good for that we might look
into one I'm not sure we're kind of
limited on the switch which most people
would be but that's from our og along
with the overclocking eSports other than
this news two quick things here and
video have their Titan XP we already
talked about that in a separate video if
you're curious to learn more about it
basically it is big Pascal there will
not be a bigger Pascal chip as far as we
can tell for this generation this looks
like about the end of it it is not a
geforce gtx chip which was stated in our
previous content and it looks like it's
being kind of targeted towards mac which
is interesting because it has the mac
ready drivers and it seems reasonable to
expect that future apple products coming
out this year might include the titan
which in that case ditching the geforce
gtx branding could make sense just from
a marketing standpoint of apple doesn't
want that on their system so that's
already been detailed in our previous
video $1200 card if you buy it
separately g.skill meanwhile as new our
RGB not rog our gb memory kits and those
will be shipping in capacities up to 128
gigabytes which would be a 16 by 8
configuration the biggest condensity per
stake is going to be 16 gigabytes so big
sticks and then they have speeds up to
38 66 megahertz we actually have one of
these that we used in our eyes and
revisit to try and get the higher speeds
that we were getting so 38 66 megahertz
CL 18 for that to the timings on that
are 18 18 18 38 that's at one point
three five volts stock and that is a
sixteen by two configurations at 32
gigabytes there and as for the other
kind of high ish end you're looking at
3200 33 33 33 34 66 and 36 hundred
megahertz speed and respectively those
are CL 15 there's also a CL 14 32
hundred megahertz kit which we have a
trident xenon RGB kit
is 3200 CL 14 and it's really good so
those are good to look out for 3333 CL
16 that's 16 18 18 38 3466 16 18 1838 as
well and 3,600 is 1719 1939 all of these
kids 1.35 geeks are bolts and then in
terms of gigabyte capacities it's mostly
16 gigabyte sticks although they do also
have 8 gigabyte sticks to bring the cost
down a little bit those are optimized
and approved for Z 217 X 99 you should
probably expect some kind of rise in
support as well officially and expected
launch is May 2017 with XMP 2.0 built in
there so hopefully not too much work to
do pricing is unknown right now and
final bit of news for folks in the US
although this is interesting externally
as well the SJ resolution 36 was signed
into law by the President and that means
that was on Monday April 3rd so that
successfully nullifies the privacy
framework that would have been put into
place otherwise by the previous FCC
group and basically prevented ISPs from
mining customer data without consent we
have some coverage of this on the
website it's unlikely that this will
change at this point without a new
Congress Senate FCC leadership so that
looks like it that's the way it's going
to be at this point we have some
coverage so Eric Hamilton wrote several
articles on this and of note we have
another article forthcoming that is
about using VPNs how to set one up other
types of private browsing advice that
will be in a full feature that publishes
probably sometime this week in written
format on a gamer's nexus net speaking
of that as always you can subscribe for
more patreon.com slash canvers next
without shout directly stored are gamers
nice and sign out of your pen or just
check back tomorrow for the r5 coverage
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
