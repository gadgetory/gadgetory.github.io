access net and today we're doing a
subjective noise comparison of the AMD
FX 8350
you color which is brand new and we're
comparing that against the old stock
cooler that it is sort of replacing or
shipping alongside so the deal here a
quick recap the Wraiths is $10 more than
the non race called FX 83-70 the race
took the place of the 83-70 so the price
is the same it's still 200 bucks for the
CPU and the wraith but the old one
dropped ten dollars so the main
difference between these two the old
cooler runs maximally at about 52 52 rpm
so 5,000 rpm plus and the new wraith
runs at about 3000 rpm what happens here
is because the wraith has 24% more
surface area to dissipate the heat
through alloy and copper and through a
larger better spec fan it's able to
sustain similar or slightly better
thermals than the old cooler as you'll
see in our charts here and we have the
full review already on the channel if
you want to see more about these thermal
charts so it's able to retain these
temperatures at a significantly lower
noise output because of this improved
cooler and none of this just a quick
disclaimer is talking about the
viability of the processor itself
we're strictly looking at the coolers
and the technology in them and the noise
levels today what we've got for you here
is a hookup of the two coolers to a
power supply directly and they're
operating at a hundred percent speed so
this is full rpm and this is what we use
for our thermal testing for many reasons
detailed in the thermal articles mostly
test methodology reasons so even if
you're using in the real world maybe an
auto setting this gives you an idea of
what the max 100% fan speed is I'll give
you a listen and then I'll explain the
setup so the first cooler is the
original stock cooler the second one is
the AMD FX
so a few things to note here first of
all obviously the race is a lot quieter
secondly the Wraith is a much more
tolerable tone the old cooler has sort
of a higher pitched frequency when it
was operating and that's partly because
of the high rpms and the bearings and
things like that the new one is more of
a mid tone output so that's more in line
with what you get in normal case fans
and because it's not producing some sort
of weird outlier noise or frequency I
should say it's a lot more tolerable to
the end user second thing is this is not
an objective noise level measurement are
not presenting decibel values because we
don't have an anechoic chamber or
anything remotely close to that to test
in so what you're listening to or what
you listen to is strictly a subjective
measurement to using our high-end $400
h6n professional studio recording mic
and we hooked that up to a couple of
different microphones shotgun mic
reporter mic things like that to just
collect different noise levels from
around the room and then we put in the
one that we thought best demonstrated
the comparison between the two the
scenario for measuring the noise for
operating the fan was identical for both
coolers so these are 100% identical
noise levels were input to the recorder
at an identical setting the tripod was
an identical distance from each cooler
in each test so you can know that these
were conducted under very perfectly
matched test configuration settings and
that means that you can make the subject
of comparison without any sort of odd
variables that may have changed in the
test setup because there were none so
that is all for the noise comparison of
the two coolers hopefully that helps
anyone out there trying to decide if
it's worth buying the Wraith check our
review on the channel for more
information on the Wraith cooler and
again patreon link in the post all video

subscribe as always thanks for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
