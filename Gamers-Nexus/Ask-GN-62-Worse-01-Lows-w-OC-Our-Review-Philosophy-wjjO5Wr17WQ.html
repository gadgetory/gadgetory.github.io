of ask GN if you have questions for the
next episode post them in the comments
section below or if you're part of our
patreon discord community you can post
them in the ask Jeon channel where I'll
check you for the next week there have
been a lot of questions since the last
episode we're gonna answer a couple of
them and then I've got some sort of a
monologue on the H 700 I versus the H
500 P and how product reviews work
before getting to that this coverage is
brought to you by EVGA and NVIDIA with
the destiny to 1080 TI bundle a 1080i
sc2 comes with a synchronous fan control
for its dual fans and nine thermal
sensors and again includes destiny to
learn more at the link in the
description below so let's open with
sort of a monologue on the H 700 I
versus aged 500 p KS reviews there's a
comment I got that's there were maybe
two or three of them that uh stood out
and we get maybe one every 100 cows or
so but this this one specifically said
Karin's access I love how you bashed the
H 500 p4 thermals but H 700 I was
actually worse than thermals so a couple
things here one that's wrong uh it's not
worse than thermals as the charts show
so to clear that up if anyone thought
the H some 100 I was worse it's probably
because one chart had a variant of the
h5
was one of the best if not the best on
the CPU torture thermals chart so let's
clear that up first in stock to stock
testing the H 500 P is in fact
objectively worse than thermals than the
H 700 I the gap is not that large but
the difference in criticism between the
two cases was that one focused on the
cooling aspect for the Aged 500 PE and
the other focused on the smart aspect
for the H 700 I so let's talk about how
we do reviews and why for for starters
and start with marketing and then we'll
get into the rest the marketing for the
coolermaster H 500 PK s very directly
stated in the review guide material sent
to me
that not only did the H 500 P position
itself to have high-volume airflow it
literally says that it guarantees high
volume air flow the same guide also
suggests several times over by no
accident that the aged 500 P is a high
airflow case and they suggest different
ways of testing that on the consumer
side everyone knows the H 500 P is a
half successor so the case was marketed
and we had review guides sent to us
saying it guarantees high airflow our
job is to sit as a last line a last
filter between marketing and the
consumer so if the marketing is this
thin is high airflow my job is to
validate that claim which we did and
I'll talk about some of the differences
in thermals in a moment NZXT is
marketing was that their case has
intelligence and machine learning and
that it creates using adaptive noise
reduction a better a better noise rpm
thermal response curve then you would
otherwise have so then my job is to test
this thing and see if it does so you can
understand then why for the Aged 700 i
review we would focus on that aspect and
for the Aged 500 p review we'd focus on
that one the airflow I think I'm pretty
sure about 95% of the the viewer base
knows this and it's just still worth
talking about how we review products
because everyone's gonna do it a little
differently I'm not here to really
debate about it because it's just a core
philosophy and it's not changing but
basically the way I look at the products
is how was it marketed how was it
marketed to me before launch how is it
marketed to consumers whether through
direct marketing materials or indirectly
through media coverage because maybe at
a press event they told our team that
the case does XYZ
and then we of course report that in the
news right up and so now indirectly or
otherwise the case is understood as
doing X Y &amp;amp; Z and so at this point we
have to validate the claim when the
product comes out and make sure it does
do in fact XY and Z and does it as well
as they've said it does so that's how I
view it as for the thermal discussion
with case reviews we again look at them
how they're marketed if be quiet came to
us with a case and they said this case
is guaranteed to be low noise output you
are guaranteed to hear very little of
the case volume if we then test that and
find that the case is middle of the
stack averaged 37 decibels for our test
system we're going to spend 10 minutes
eviscerating it and probably start in
the coverage by peeling the foam out of
the case much like we started this
coverage with pulling the smart device
out of the case or like we started some
of the age 500p coverage with popping
the glass out of the panel if the idea
is with each one we're looking at what
it says it does and then validating it
and sometimes the companies marketed
their products appropriately and that's
accurate other times it's not so it's
not just the thermal thing trying to
poke holes in the review by saying you
cared about thermals for this case but
not this one
is sort of misguided because it misses
the fact that marketing matters and like
for be quiet again
for example if be quiet had average
thermals but it were the quietest case
on the bench I wouldn't really make a
big deal out of it because the point is
that it's quiet and they're marketing it
as a quiet case in this this
hypothetical scenario so that's
something to remember and also just to
reiterate here the other big point with
the H 700 ion the H 500 P was if you
look at the unconstrained thermal
performance the H 500 P when you remove
the front panel completely would drop 10
to 12 degrees Celsius on the CPU
thermals H 700 I would drop about 6.3
exactly 6.3 action
and about five for the GPU so the H 700
i with its front panel design is pretty
close to its maximum potential for the
stock configuration it has with our test
system whereas the H 500 P the
coolermaster case was 12 degrees away
from its maximum potential and then when
we replaced the front panel with mesh we
got it to about 8 degrees improvement so
the difference there being that now you
are maybe I can't remember if two to
four degrees away from max panel list
potential versus the mesh because you're
still fighting a mesh so you've got
static pressure to consider for those
big fans as opposed to 12 degrees away
so what we're looking at there isn't
necessarily outright thermal performance
of which one's better and the H 700 I
was better anyway but we're not really
looking at that what we're looking at is
how bad is the panel design or how good
is the panel design and in case a vers B
if one is pretty close to max potential
that's not a bad panel design in terms
of airflow so this goes back to a
discussion of thermals aren't some
magical number that you just apply to
things or gets assigned to them like a
score from fire strike it depends very
much on every single component in the
bench how its tested what software is
used to test it is a B X or not is it a
fixed power load or is it modulating are
using liquid or air which has an impact
on how long it takes to ramp thermals
what materials are the case is the case
made out of because that'll impact kind
of how long it hangs on to its
temperature as well so yeah lots of
stuff think about here in terms of how
reviews work for us but I wanted to
point those out because it seemed like
people were upset that I hurt their
feelings about the H 500 P in a couple
cases it was not that common but it was
common enough that I thought you know we
should talk about how we review products
so people were upset that the H 500 P
didn't get a good review and you know
the H 700 I didn't necessarily get a
good review
either we just said it's a good case
that they ruined with this and the age
500p really had a lot more problems than
the airflow so that's the other thing I
mean like it panel quality is very cheap
it doesn't innovate features it doesn't
do anything impressive and new and it
countered its own marketing so that's
kind of the difference it's more than
just airflow as the point here it's
everything and age 500p advertised
airflow so it got a lot of focus but it
also had a lot of other flaws
it still looks okay but like we said
lates 500p review you know if you like
how it looks great go buy it but uh
otherwise there's all the information so
just want it to address how a review
works from my perspective so let's get
on some questions the first one is from
discord Unilever who said Steve you say
about this you say about some games that
in overclocked GPU doesn't work well
with it what does this mean exactly what
happens if you do have an overclocked
GPU and what would cause these problems
I said this in a 10-7 TTI review to give
everyone some a point of reference so
for honors specifically that game there
are a couple others for honors
specifically behaves very oddly with
clocks it's not a clock fluctuation or
modulation what it is is we can apply a
225 megahertz offset to the colorful
1073 I reviewed and have it stable in
every game that we test otherwise fire
strike everything like that you play for
honor and what happens and to some
extent Ghost Recon both Ubisoft before
honor with a two 25 megahertz offset as
we've shown in the past with this
particular card is micro stuttering it
has so bad that your frame times just
have huge latency between them so you
end up with something like an 11 0.1%
low value now a converted chart and
that's happening I think because for
honor seems to enumerate the clock a
little bit higher than other games so I
think having those bigger OCS on it
pushes it beyond the cards capabilities
in a way that other games don't
- they don't they don't seem to create
that scenario so it's a very specific
game for it so the 1070 SC I've thought
my head we had a much bigger overclock
for other games than we dropped it to
something like a 25 50 maybe 50 or
somewhere in that but a sub 100
megahertz offset and that was because it
had way worse performance otherwise and
for honor now if you look at our Ghost
Recon wildlands charts from the 1070 TI
review you'll also notice that the 1070
TI when overclocked although it has
higher averages actually had lower 0.1%
low values the overclock was not
unstable I think that's a misconception
that's pretty common it was not an
unstable overclock and in fact the clock
was sustained almost perfectly flat so
that wasn't the problem either but
because of the game works we're running
into some other kind of limitation I
don't know what that one specifically is
but sometimes it can be power or your
power throttling really hard on occasion
although you tend to see that reflected
in the clock rate or it could just be
that you're on the precipice of
instability with that game to the point
where your frame times look worse but
your average looks better which goes
back to why we do things with frame
times so yeah basically you just keep an
eye out for micro stutter and for what
what people would call
stutters in general and your average
might be higher but behind the scenes it
might be actually worse performance
overall and it's just on a game by game
basis and I don't know why it always
happens but next question is from Shiva
who I think posted on YouTube and said
hey Steve question for next asked yen
since placing a iOS at the top of a case
as exhaust is now common practice would
it be practical to use the rear fan as
intake in theory it should help with vrm
cooling and keeping a positive air
pressure and you could probably use a
magnetic air filter thanks so yeah I I'm
gonna take this question modify it or
modify the answer to be a little less
direct about that we've done testing
with top intake and
in the past years ago at this point for
the most part and you can actually end
up with better performance I know you
said rear end tape but with tobot and
take you've got something directly above
the cooler if you have a tower cooler
and above the vrm you get air over both
those things your problem becomes dust
of course through the top but hopefully
you can deal with it with a filter rear
intake I can't say that I've actually
done any objective numbers testing on
that the problem is I guess well if you
have a CLC you avoid the problem of
creating a vortex or conflicting airflow
so you avoid that problem but yeah you
would get air over the VRMs it's gonna
be cooler air than what the VRMs are
generating for a heat output but um or
power output I should say but I I think
I would try and do a top intake instead
if possible unless it's that slots taken
by your CLC because if you kind of think
about it well the times the backfoot
case for people is really close to a
wall it's not gonna have the most
airflow there the most access to air and
a GPU being lower in the case is if it's
a blower card especially but generally
there's heat coming out from the back of
the case that's gonna be lower than the
top rear exhaust would be so you've got
power supply exhaust you have GPU
exhaust and those things will kind of
just get sucked back into the system and
that air is still gonna be cooler than
what's in the case most likely it's
diffusing as soon as it exits the case
but I think optimally you do top and
take if you're concerned about be around
temperatures well have more on vrm
temperatures very soon next question
actually I should I should mention this
too before people fight in the comments
over it yeah heat rises yes but not
really a relevant amount we've talked
about this before so there are reasons
to do top intake or exhaust that do not
have to do with the fact that heat rises
because heat may rise but as we said in
an old old SGN it's relevant when you're
blasting air with a thousand
p.m. fan it's just it's such a small
amount of of heat rising from natural
physics that I would not let that factor
into where you're placing your fans you
put your fans where you need airflow and
that's the end of the story don't worry
about how heat moves because it's it's
really not going to play into it next
question
Gorn why don't we see broader use of USB
C in the desktop enthusiast market seems
the trend in the laptop world both PC
and Mac so is there some reason why USB
sees promise of one connection to rule
them all shouldn't take off for desktops
I think I don't have a great answer for
this but I I think that we're seeing it
more in motherboards now for Kate you
really do see it in cases though I think
for cases to start implementing USB C
required a few things one is they needed
motherboards to start implementing it
it's a chain reaction they can't really
lead that charge they need the
motherboard vendors to lead it and to
the other thing to consider is that
cases have often a multi-year production
cycle and a lot of companies kind of by
the older used tooling from from
companies that are bigger than them from
OMS and suppliers and those things
aren't necessarily updated for several
years at at the RL 0 5 to Lynne is still
used like 4 years later so it'll take a
while for the cases to kind of catch up
because things that are on like a
multi-year production cycle it doesn't
seem like it's hard to change an ad USB
type-c in there but if they have to
change like the molding or anything like
that the cost might just be prohibitive
or maybe they've already started
production I think you'll see more of it
towards Computex this year that should
kind of be around when the cycle
refreshes again next question Dave J
regarding liquid metal Tim have you
looked into corrosion concerns I've read
that the gallium alloy used in liquid
metal reacts negatively with most metals
especially aluminum and copper
potentially causing damage and poor
performance long term have you
considered testing this out yourself and
is looking
safe over long term for dewetting cpus i
have not tested it myself I can tell you
that some liquid metals like conductor
not should absolutely not be used with
an aluminum heatsink because they will
destroy it they don't corrode so just
read the read the package they should
say when there's a metal that they
definitely don't work with conductor not
makes it really clear in their their
materials that come with the liquid
metal that you absolutely should not use
it with aluminum I haven't tried the
other liquid metals the cool abs I
haven't really used so I don't know how
those are for long-term use but I yeah I
mean the only thing I can really speak
to here with any level of authority is
that just don't use them with aluminum
coolers copper I'd I don't directly I
have not used any that corrode copper
but we'll see if that comes up the
future next question is a rythmics just
out of curiosity it would it be possible
to test CP to GPU or vice versa
contribute a contribution to
contaminating each other's thermals as
most of us already know poor air flow
increases internal temperatures which
effect in effect increases CBN GB
temperatures as a result my question is
how much do they impact each other long
story short yes so our case reviews the
torture tests our CPU and GPU burnin and
3d mark is a lighter version of CPU and
GPU burnin and then you can look at it
in a blender tests instituted this year
where we do a blender CPU workload
that's only on the CPU and a blender GPU
or low that's only on the GPU and that
will help you understand how the to
impact each other but yeah if you're
running a torture on each it gets a lot
hotter hence the name torture test
because obviously if a GPU is spewing
heat inside of a case the CPU is gonna
keep pulling that back through its own
cooler so we do actually account for
that in our case reviews just if you
didn't already know that that's why all
those different charts are there because
they tell you slightly different
information
a couple more maybe one or two more here
let's see let's do this one's fast
commander Powell what's the deal with
faulty tr4 sockets and how can the
consumer avoid them we have this problem
at PAX when we did a coolermaster c7 RP
build basically take your Torx wrench
that is provided with the thread ripper
CPU locate the Torx screws that are on
the flank outer flank of the socket not
the one for the CPU mount but the outer
ones and then tighten them until the
wrench clicks they are the same torque
spec as the CPU that's how you know if
yours are loose or not and that's how
you avoid them you just before you build
the system tighten those down I actually
have had to do it to a couple boards
myself so next question is uh let's see
this one is very fast as well cuz I'm
going to be reading an answer from build
Zoid
Samuel CC said longtime listener
first-time backer is on patreon thank
you the question basically is what's the
difference between fixed voltage and
adaptive voltage for overclocking and
that that's kind of the crux of it so I
sent I sent the whole question over to
build Zoid bill joy said both me and
Roman that's their Bauer have done tests
on idle power draw using fixed versus
adaptive voltage you save like 10 to 30
watts depending on the CPU and then he
says actually last 10 to 30 watts at the
wall and he also says basically it makes
little to no difference on mainstream
CPUs on a thing like the Intel high-end
desktop platforms it makes more of a
difference so that's what I've got for
you on that one I use manual voltage
personally so I actually haven't really
messed with adaptive last question at
all all's ati eighty I lols says
important question do you have more cats
yes I don't know if we took a shot of
midnight not too long ago if we can find
it we'll put it in thank you for for
watching as always you go to
