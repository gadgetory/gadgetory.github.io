joined by Cliff John product manager at
MSI of laptop cliff and I have known
each other for quite a while now we
probably worked together like my name is
Zhao round there so I lift here we're
going to talk about the software on the
laptops cliff I know you saw the video
you have any comment or statement yeah
so what we're going to do is are we
understand that that's a concern for
certain customers we already have
studied that for quite a while how to do
something so somewhere around second
half this year we will come out with
software and anguses will be able to
check box select anything that they want
to uninstall from there so then if they
want them they can have a complete clean
OS at the end of it ok so basically the
laptop will ship with like a an
installer utility and then you can just
check boxes for the different software
solutions right yeah like we're still
have it all because the whole idea is
all empty for us we believe in that is
the features and on valuable end users
so but then on top of it will also have
a software already pre-installed there
so you guys can just uncheck and delete
any software from this ok so then it's a
it's a clean uninstaller so the laptop
comes with the stuff on it and you check
the boxes to remove it that right yeah
ok so I mean while I got you here I
think that address is probably mostly
concern for people MSI I guess knows
about the potential problem with like
performance right yeah I mean like a
yellow today and user experience it's
all what we want so we always listen to
comments and that's why we are going to
make some decisions and solutions for
everybody
all right well very good I guess let's
go ahead and just talk about one of the
new features here while I have you here
so how about the de max Q stuff you want
to talk about one of the new laptops
Alain
so what happened is I started working
with a media Vuckovich of putting the
1070 in two hours of feeling like GS
line up so we will be shipping as soon
as the ship days and bugaloo we'll have
everything ready to ship at that time
right we have more information on max Q
and MSI's new laptop in the article link
in the description below cliff I really
appreciate it thank you sure oh wait and
I think you have your answer so just
leave your comments below let them know
what you think but yeah I mean I think
that pretty much wraps it so I was
always subscribe for more
patreon.com/scishow Gary's ex thought
was out directly
we'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
