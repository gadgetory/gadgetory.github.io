out like don't hurt my dog hey Ron I'm
here with luke from technically
floatplane you'd probably know him from
- tech tips as well yeah we have a
pretty fun topic I think that's it's
gonna be difficult yeah we're gonna try
and compress it is VR dead this is this
has been a question that's been asked a
couple times I made a video about this
like quite a while in the past and some
people will either really liked it or
really hated it before that this video
is brought to you by Dollar Shave club's
daily essentials starter set this full
grooming kit ships at 5 dollars and
includes a trial sized versions of the
companies at popular shave butter body
wash and wipes and also includes a solid
high-quality razor and a full set of
cartridges go to dollarshaveclub.com
slash gamers nexus to get the daily
essentials starter kit for just $5 and
with free shipping or click the link
below this event was actually quite
interesting for the whole question right
LTS for clearance yeah LT X 2018 we just
had the event is wrapping up right now
he'll see the packing various things up
and I was somewhat involved with the VR
booth and the VR booth had the longest
line of anything at LT X and it had a
three plus hour long lineup and not only
was the lineup that long but people
actually waited that whole time to try
VR so like we've got cynics like me
being like it's like it's in a dead
space like maybe maybe VR I'll come back
later and actually fairly shortly after
I made the original is VR dead video
yeah a few weeks later I was invited to
go to I am with Intel and as like a fun
thing before I am started we all went to
the Facebook headquarters to go to
ocular okay and everyone in the office
had seen that video of car we're super
pissed with me but then the one of the X
bigwigs from Naughty Dog gaming huh was
there and it's now a big guy at oculus
and he gave a speech to all the
influencers that were there about how
like you know VR might not really be
ready and maybe imitators yeah yeah yeah
that was it that was pretty cool but
yeah so it might not be the most
consumer friendly thing right now
in my opinion right but seeing the three
plus hour-long lineup was actually quite
interested it's pretty eye-opening I
think yeah cuz that's the thing that we
we forget easily having access to VR
yeah it's like probably 90% of the
potential audience has barely tried it
or not tried it at all you know in three
hours to play for ten minutes or
something like that yeah so yeah I guess
there's still potential there I before
the mass push of the vibe and the rift
and everything yeah we did a video at
CES years and years ago talking about
how we didn't think VR was ready yet
yeah we got so much does not like it but
honestly like I I do think it's
interesting technology it's done a lot
it's actually like you can actually play
it and really get into it I know you
were into it for oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I'm still into it it is and it
absolutely has a future it's just the
the concise think the consumer space and
the numbers back this up the consumer
space isn't really ready for it yet but
it's it's still every single time we
have an event like this it's really
canoeing a little bit be like you get to
see someone try for the first time you
get to see the reaction yeah it's really
cool every time like there was a kid in
line talked to me for a while about how
he had tried cardboard VR yeah and
that's it and it's he's he comes out
he's like wow it's so much different
like of course yeah well that's there's
sort of two main problems I think anyway
two main problems one is obviously
accessibility yeah I'm like fitting it
in your house falls into that where it's
really expensive and it's even more
expensive to have a spare room yeah and
even for me it's not even necessarily
the like spare room issue I live in a
basement suite and that's fairly low
ceilings yeah if I ever went up with a
control I would punch the roof yeah but
I have to constantly think about like
don't reach upwards there's nothing much
like technology you can buy for your
house that you might destroy things with
like I don't know the other problem too
is quality of games yeah and I think
some of this comes down to just
developers need to learn how to build
for VR yeah as opposed to building the
games they already do and then try to
shoehorn VR into it yeah it's a it's a
new medium and a lot of times when you
get a new
or a new type of system or platform or
something like that yeah you you have a
while where everyone tries to adapt what
we already have to it right and that's
not the greatest time and then you get
people going like oh this is a new
completely unique angle that we can
approach with and that's usually where
you get your goods and there's there's
definitely some cool things for over
recall it's really good beat Sabre
people are super into beat Sabre like
there's a boxing game that Linus wants
me to get into and he uses for cardio
and it's just it's just like a car do
boxing Samoas VRI uses VR yeah just to
make it more exciting and like there's
definitely stuff out there but yeah
there isn't like the killer app right
there isn't the like halo one for the
original light yeah that's a really good
way yeah yeah yeah and it's it's I don't
know
so finding a way to make the games fit
the platform I guess yeah instead of the
other way around and I think to tie into
what it exactly what you're saying beat
Sabre does a pretty good job yeah yeah
yeah yeah and a robo recall I guess is
that's it right I think I played that
one ages ago yeah there are a couple
good ones but still a matter of getting
actual attention from people beyond just
like three hours in the line at LTX or
whatever which is also super cool yeah
but it's only ten minutes and yeah I
feel bad for everyone in the line yeah I
mean like to be fair to reduce in order
to reduce the line you'd have to
basically cut the demo time yeah that's
part of the problem too is you really
can't have a five minute VR demo it
doesn't it doesn't capture the whole
thing so I think one thing we tried to
set it up so that there was like like
what triple-headed VR that's one
computer running on raid with three
systems on it blah blah blah and then
like no one actually cared about that at
all everyone just wanted to play the oh
yeah I think next year will come with
like probably maybe a five separate
systems run five different setups try to
get way more people through probably
still ten minutes which makes it really
brutal for the line but but like you
were saying there isn't really the value
there yeah four five so if you for for
VR to really I don't know to actually
regain traction like I had a couple
years ago so we talked about VR briefly
at CES a year or two
go yeah and I guess the the question I
have is well do you think we'll have to
go through the entire process again of
like like the whole building all the
hive dump all the marketing money into
it build new technology or is there
enough of a market there now where
people can kind of pick it up I kind of
have a feeling I don't know I'm
definitely not a market expert either
but yeah neither of us are experts we're
just yeah we're just spitballing yeah
exactly but my like assumption how I
think it's gonna go is that we already
had the height that it's a household
name there's always there's already been
like the the advertisements for Samsung
gear VR right on with on the radio all
the parents know that VR all those
parents on VRS we've broken that
threshold which is good so I think the
next push will probably be a slower one
yeah
a market adoption will start picking up
a little bit more the price is going to
come down the the ease of access is
going to go up the problems are gonna
start diminishing like all that kind of
stuff and there's more and more people
are gonna start adopting it
your friend has won you played at his
house you pick it up I think that it
will be the next stage I don't think
we're necessarily there right now yeah
that kind of stuff is definitely
happening but not at the scale that I'm
talking about yeah it needs to be quite
a bit more but yeah I think it'll be a
slower hype ramp it's also kind of
checking out of the egg pen where
companies aren't I know they're not
gonna want to invest in it if they don't
think if they think the return will be
the same as the last yeah six months of
VR yeah and it's it's that's an
interesting point I'm gonna take that
and bring it to Bethesda yeah but that's
this very controversial company and in
the community horse armor yeah paid mods
look how the horse armor turned out
though yeah all C's an entire industry
now yeah actually I guess they kind of
knew it was coming but people like to go
after them and some of its valid and
some of its not I guess but that's Todd
Howard making fun of people saying that
there's bugs in his game was probably
not the right way for him to go but
whatever whatever whatever anyways but
there's des and and some other companies
but Bethesda definitely is championing
VR super-hard like all their games are
coming up with VR versions the the ports
for fallout 4 and doom doom VFR yeah
well not perfect
are quite good and actually like like I
think my dad played the court for
Fallout 4 in an in VFR and it was one of
his favorite to be our experiences he's
ever had alright this he he well he
jumps into the game and he thinks it's
like oh whatever he's done via a couple
times and he has the controllers and he
has a gun and dogmeat comes up so he
crouches down and pets him and then a
zombie comes up and hits dogmeat and I
don't think I've ever seen my dad like
spring into action I think it pops back
to starts taking everything out like
don't hurt my dog it was pretty cool
yeah that's that's that's the ideal
experience is every single time exactly
yeah that's hard to do but yeah yeah I
don't know this if the Fezzik keeps
pushing and a few other companies keep
pushing and the hardware keeps moving
forward yeah I think it's just gonna
slowly ramp up right and I I think it's
basically inevitable that VR is gonna be
huge
just don't know when or exactly how yeah
well that's I was speaking with Roger
Kaduri a couple years ago when he was at
AMD and one of his big things was he was
like I want around what it was 16 kV R
or whatever before I retire yeah so and
that's what he thought he seemed to
really believe that that's kind of the
resolution you needed to feel completely
immersed the games obviously completely
different issue oh yeah having something
that's actually fun but and there's
there's other types of like one thing
that I've been saying for a long time
everyone has their like this is
important to me
yeah lag that they're gonna hold for me
are and mine is the the different types
of controllers the different types of
feedback that's a good one for me like
like really early VR when you your hands
weren't in the game yet
the second you upgraded to the point
where you had your hands and again I was
huge for everybody if you start getting
tracking on people's like feet even so
you look down and like without guys
can't see this but like you look at your
foot and you actually see your foot
moving and stuff the via an immersion
level goes way up and you start being
able to feel stuff like that that's when
we're getting to like I don't know when
the heck yeah but it's like you wear a
certain pair of gloves that make it so
like when you touch a tree like a
slapstick sounds like kind of rough and
like right
we're we're pretty far from that but
like adaptive material you still do
stuff I mean like people have tried to
do something with that because it's just
like phone technology it's a haptic
feedback yeah yeah you know a small
vibration or whatever in the glove that
would even help batana
and you can take it beyond there and
there's there's places where this is
actually a pretty interesting one but I
don't remember the the name of the guy's
YouTube channel unfortunately he's he's
huge it's smarter every day
yeah smarter every day has a video where
he went to a lab at some school they
have this giant behemoth glove and it
has to be plugged into like it's
basically like a generator but they'll
scale it all down and it had straps that
would pull your fingers back okay if you
go to grip something and pick it up you
actually have to like hold on really
harnessed in you have to fight against
that's cool actually oh yeah it's just
there's a big freaking box and it's a
giant glove yeah we need to scale that
stuff down but like we're moving in that
in that direction yeah really cool yeah
we'll see I guess at this point it's a
matter of what happens first consumer
adoption or companies just pushing you
brute force in it and yet option yeah
which they already definitely tried like
Intel AMD Nvidia all dumped in money and
they dumped really hard yeah and that to
be fair that did build a bit of a phone
definitely and there's there's some
interesting industries that are starting
to rely on it fairly heavily actually
like I don't even remember what they use
it for to be completely honest but one
of the guys at LMG his brother works at
a motorcycle motorcycle helmet
manufacturer okay and they use VR for
some reason some kind of engineering or
design yeah I don't remember what
exactly it is but I remember they they
actually bought a secondhand headset off
of me because they wanted to like try it
right they tried it and then bought
their own whole set I have new stuff I
don't know yeah I don't even know what
they use it for and then there's a
there's a highly controversial new
company that is planning on easy that's
going to be interesting to see some
comments with this but the wall that
America is planning right potentially
they were thinking about making a like
non solid wall where they set up these
giant poles and their sensors on them
they can detect movement and like they
can like it's a whatever percentage
chance that that's a human or that's an
animal or whatever they want to use
people in VR I monitor these remotely or
whatever yeah yeah yeah so there's
definitely like surveillance
applications and like I'm sure there's
drone applications and stuff like that
engineering and design is pretty huge
for it like there's there's a lot of
industry is starting to pick it up and
industry tends to come first
yeah in sumer yeah I think I don't know
maybe maybe our industry went about it
backwards tried to force consumer who
could come full circle you might yeah it
could be
it knows what'll happen well there's
some thoughts from to complete non
market access honestly it's just an
excuse for me to talk with so hope you
enjoyed it as always subscribe for more
Luke run split play now if you're not
signed up for floatplane who can you get
there currently Linus obviously Linus
bit wit and tech deals we've got a few
other people that are basically signed
up to come on the way but we want to get
the platform mature more mature before
we bring them on like Paul and Jays two
cents sure cool yeah so check check out
floatplane if you haven't already yeah
and thank you Luke for joining me thanks
man good to see you good yeah we'll see
