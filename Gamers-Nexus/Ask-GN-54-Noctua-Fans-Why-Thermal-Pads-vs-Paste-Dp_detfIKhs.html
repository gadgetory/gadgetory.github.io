sgn as always if you have questions you
can leave them in the comment section
below
or if you're a patreon back you can go
to patreon.com/scishow sexist comes out
directly and then join our discord where
we haven't asked GN discord for patreon
backers so this week we've got a couple
of topics one the opening topic is on
knock - as fans the thing that blew up
on build a PC and then we'll be getting
into the viewer and reader questions
before getting to that we have a brand
new shirt design so that's this one
right here this is on the GN store you
go to gamers Nexus squarespace.com to
grab one of those we have them in teal
and in grey with cotton and tri-blend
and they were kind of debuted on our
first stream which happened last night
as of filming so that'll be actually
last night for you as well um so pretty
cool stuff we're going to do more
streams in the future I don't have a
schedule for you it's just kind of going
to be when I want to take something
apart like this and we'll go from there
we'll try to announce it on Twitter but
that's about it alright so for the
episode let's open with Noctua the build
the PC thread that blew up if you didn't
see it was basically that there are
manufacturing differences between the
fans made in China and the fans made in
Taiwan by Noctua so the a f-14s I think
were the ones that were discussed there
and I theoretically would also apply to
the 120-millimeter fans so I have some
thoughts on this we are actually getting
a couple sets of these fans in from
China and Taiwan to test I will tell you
right now what my kind of hypothesis is
leading into it from an industry
standpoint and then we'll see if the
testing disproves any of it so first of
all the differences pointed out in the
reddit thread were primarily color
there's a slight color variation between
the standard ugly nock to a fan and the
slightly different ugly nock to a fan
between the China and the Taiwan
factories and then beyond that there
were some differences pointed out in the
what would consist of your output from
the tooling or the mold and those were
small features like a slightly different
depth profile for some of the
if it's that are cut into the side of
the fan or that are on the fan blades
and slightly different changes in the
the outer four screw hole areas so let's
first talk about tooling manufacturing
and molds for making different products
when we've toured a few factories in
Taiwan ads in China and the thing that
is ultimately the companies make tooling
which for cases anyway tooling it
consists of large pieces of steel that
you use to create the chassis for a fan
you would have tooling you would have
molds or you'd injection mold stuff
things like that there's a tolerance
even at the same factory one tool to the
next or one molds the next because they
age so the source the source mold or the
source tool if you're doing case tooling
eventually wears out and has to be
replaced and when you replace it
hopefully your tolerances are pretty
tight but there might be some changes
though you would hope that they're
isolated to a point that you're not
going to introduce some kind of issue to
the product so that's number one that
means that there can be changes even
from the same factory but maybe not as
big as the one seen here that's not to
say they are big changes but they are
certainly bigger than the very small
things you might see normally the next
thing to discuss is with the the move
from one factory to another you're
either going to be cloning tools or
making them in another place so that's a
factor to account for and then there's
tooling the age so as they get used and
worn down it may be the case that one
factory just happens to produce a whole
lot more fans than the other
so maybe the tool made that was
responsible responsible for making the
fan that was shown in the pictures was
older or newer than the one next to it
so those are things to keep in mind next
thing to keep in mind is a lot of the
stuff that Noctua boasts for their fans
and all of the other fan companies too
is just kind of marketing it doesn't
really do anything of note that's not to
say the fans aren't good they certainly
do their job but also a lot of those
small features if
if you were to take putty and fill in
all those tiny holes on the inner frame
of the fan I would bet there'd be a
pretty small difference I'm not positive
we'll test hit but I would bet there'd
be pretty small difference and even less
so when you have the the holes or the
divots on each fan chassis but one is
slightly different than the other one
but they're still present I think that's
going to be a small change ultimately
this whole Noctua thing looks to me like
it's one of the usual industry
discussions that pops up every couple
years happens pretty frequently where a
manufacturer changes supplier or factory
how people notice and then everyone is
like why are you selling me a product
that's worse than what was originally
designed now sometimes that can be the
case but not always there's a reason for
example that Logitech doesn't talk about
or confirm or disclose their supplier or
source for their switches in the mice so
we can ask the question as simple as you
say you have 50 million clicks switches
are there's Omron and they'll say we're
not going to answer that and as they've
pointed out to me it's not because
they're trying to be difficult or
because they don't know or because they
think we can't find out it's because
they don't want to go on record if
supply changes and that's true for most
of these companies and that goes to per
fans as well so if there's a supply side
change or a factory change they try to
make it happen silently and then
theoretically the new product should
match the quality of the old one the
difference here is with Knox oil you're
basically looking at color so that's
sort of annoying yes the color of one
fan is different than the other if
you're trying to color match your system
with Noctua fans then then that would be
kind of annoying but we'll see I have
some coming in we just finally for the
first time ever got in touch with Knox
what I'm going to try and get them to
just send me a bunch of fans from each
factory so we can do a large sample size
test and either I'll be wrong and there
are actually large differences or or not
there might be small differences if they
want something a larger sample size
we're also getting our own from readers
viewers and just buying them online
so we should have samples from hopefully
the official source Noctua and then
retail sources that way there's no
concern of did they just send you
special samples that were painted
differently or something ok so I think
that's not but basically the knocks
within it seems to me like it's
potentially a little overblown in terms
of coverage and concern and things like
that but there could definitely be some
manufacturing quality differences
generally moving one factory to the nut
to another you have those it could be
possible that the China or the
taiwan-based Factory is producing
plastics or using a mold that is in fact
lower quality but but let's just kind of
wait and we'll see what the testing
shows if any difference at all
ultimately the differences between them
are pretty insignificant from the looks
of it but we'll find out next next real
question this one comes from YouTube it
looks like I think so it comes from
Kaidu who says oh yeah this was easy
this was on that had GPU quad GPU anther
machine so this count was kind of
amusing a idea said regarding the GPUs
that we had on the shelf we have a shelf
of GPUs because we use them for work
said why don't you use them for mining
waste of card just sitting there so a
couple things they don't just sit there
the content that people watch on this
channel does in fact require video cards
and then also I think the definition of
waste is maybe a little different
between us I wouldn't want to use cards
100 percent load mining and then have to
use that same card for thermal testing
later because who the hell knows what
kind of abuse that went through under a
hundred percent load non-stop it may no
longer represent a real user scenario or
it made something may burn out or some
other issue could pop up or there's some
difference between stock that makes it
no longer representative and that makes
it a bad test no we don't abuse the
cards for mining played with it for a
bit for that how do manufacturers feel
that mining video but that was about it
so I would not consider that a waste as
a side point there was a comment replied
to that one I think that I ended up
deleting for a lot of reasons but it
said someone else or someone else made a
comment saying that there was a certain
level of arrogance of having a lot of
video cards on a shelf just as a
reminder generally speaking you don't
walk into Lowe's or Home Depot and look
around go wow these people are really
full of themselves look at all of this
hardware they have here man that's I I
can't shop here there's too much
arrogance coming from the drills and the
hammers on the shelves I'm going to have
to go somewhere else so yeah we actually
do need the hardware for work that's why
we have it this leads into the next
question which was what do you do with
old hardware so pretty good transition
there for once the old hardware answer
this in the video Commons as well but
there's a few different options so
things that are smaller GPUs video card
CPUs we try to keep basically forever
where as long as as reasonable video
cards we're starting to run out of space
for those so that is a problem but CPUs
we have plenty of space for memory
plenty of space for so we try to keep
those for a few reasons one is
regression testing so a couple examples
of when we would pull an old piece of
hardware off the shelf would include the
i7 930 revisit where the 22 Connery K
revisit where you basically grab an old
product and say I wonder how this does
today
that's pretty good content it gets good
views it's certainly worth keeping and
for something like an i7 930 just
speaking very plainly we're going to
make more money on the content creation
for a revisit on that than we would for
selling it for 30 50 whatever dollars it
sells for these days and also it's just
kind of cool to hang on to that stuff
for other regression reasons like what
if someone discovers some major flaw or
issue with these things there were
recently some hyper threading bug
discussions pertaining to older
processors and it's good to have that
stuff around so that you can test it if
it comes down to needing to test it so
we hand out to it for those reasons and
comparative analysis what if
becomes out with the competitor to
Company C which I'm using because those
letters don't start with IA or n if
Company B comes out with a competitor 2
company sees last-gen mid-range product
we want to have that last gen mid-range
product to make sure we can test it in
modern era new drivers at all and see
how it works so that's what we try to do
some stuff like cases are just
impossible to keep because they're huge
and you hang on to the stuff that's
either new and might you might need it
or is particularly interesting and like
for example the anti HTS 340 non-elite
that's an old case now but I keep it
because it's I mean we liked it and it
was very popular so it's good to hold on
to because what if in the future we want
to do
how does today's I'm the exceeds that's
340 compared to whatever competitor
comes out four or five years later
whatever it is but eventually you have
to get rid of cases they're too big so
we do have a local high school that
actually we have a connection there
where we donate some of the older cases
to the school so they can use them for
the computer engineering class some
stuff gets sold or given to friends but
that's all pretty standard stuff I think
for reviewers and then the smaller stuff
CPUs we hang out to GPUs as long as we
can what else even is there SSDs we
actually use everyday and test benches
so there's there's going to go anywhere
but I think that answers that question
for the most part the next one is a
question that was for AMD I passed it
along so Crimson asked this in some
video it was one of our Vega videos
maybe the hybrid modders something
crimson asked does that Vega do 10 bit
OpenGL because only fire pro and
quadrant cards can do it currently and
video may give you ten bit DirectX but
no application with ten bit support uses
it so I sent that quote to Andy and the
representative got back couple days
later and said good news 10-bit color is
supported in OpenGL on the Vega Frontier
edition did not comment on our activator
of course you'd expect that but I think
that hence just had pretty cleanly next
one this is from Zeta who is on discord
in the patreon group Zeta said
is there a reference motherboard design
like with graphics cards oh wait and on
I misread one of the words mother bet
powered mother reference mother Bower
design so Zeta we talked about this in
chat but for everyone else this was a
more popular thing to talk about a
couple years ago so if anyone remembers
the Intel boards that they made the
actual Intel branded boards they did the
whole campaign that was a better
together which I think AMD may have done
as well at some point but they basically
did the whole better together by an
Intel board as an Intel CPU thing and
some of those were more beefed up than
others but this was around the era when
we last looked into this discussion of
motherboard reference designs the
manufacturers did and still do supply a
course back that says the boards for
this processor this architecture need to
have an A+ for pin or a single a pen or
minimally a for pin or whatever it is
for EVs trouble and then they also have
suggestions for other components use
maybe the RM layout suggestions they'll
have the spec for the PCH or the chipset
the spec for the CPU and how many lanes
it can support and all of that goes into
basically laying out this is your max
PCIe slot count that you can reasonably
use this is your max SATA slot count
before you have to get your own
third-party controller and send stuff
like that so there's sort of a reference
design I don't know the extent of that
today I'm actually not sure on if the
board vendors still use a lot of that
stuff as heavily but when Intel made
their own boards it was more common to
talk about that kind of thing or hear
about that kind of thing at conventions
and booths where they'd say based on
Intel's whatever reference board that
they were using at the time and this is
also where you run into questions of
what does Intel use what does AMD use
when they're building the CPUs and
obviously no bother boards exist yet
generally make their own and test with
those but a next question is tau tau
says all the pre-built this is a youtube
I think although this might be a discord
I don't know anymore
all the pre-built liquid-cooled AIB
partner cards I have
our dual slot cards with AC LC cooling
the GPU and maybe the vram with Reverend
style fan cooling the BRM and other non
GPU components why haven't we seen a
single slot aiv partner liquid cooled
cards using full covered blocks and rad
mounted pumps similar to what we get
with the ek predator so I think a lot of
that answer is it's cheap and relatively
easy to source a c LC from a Sutekh or
from does anyone else even do them on
GPUs I don't know basically coolermaster
Corsair coolermaster EVGA are the people
who do liquid cooling gigabyte does as
well and the cooler for Andy and I think
last I checked for gigabyte came from
cooler master have to check my own
content on the I actually it is cool
master and then the coarser one on MSI
is an ASA tech supplied cooler EVGA is
an ASA tech supplied cooler
I don't know that cool it does anything
right now in that space but either way
it's quick and easy to throw one of
those on there cool the GP with that and
those pumps are big so they're not going
to really fit single slot which is the
main answer to that question as for why
not get into a full covered block well
at that point you're actually designing
something and that takes money time
things like that I was going to say
effort but that seems dismissive but
basically just money and time and money
and time are not something that a lot of
these companies will put into a
closed-loop solution because at that
point you're really most the way to an
open loop solution anyway and also you
start running into having to custom
design a pump or something like that
unless you can source it from someone
else
ATX not going to supply you a pump
that'll work with that kind of open loop
layout unless you really start going
down the custom path at which point your
cost goes up a whole lot lead time to
produce it goes up a whole lot maybe
it's no longer relevant once it's
actually done the card is aged but it's
mostly time and money like most things
in the industry and then at that point
you're just again competing with
open-loop anyway and some of these
companies do make open-loop cards or
blocks so at that point they're just
competing with themselves
next question is AJ Thomas who says
those from YouTube what happens if a PC
fails when does error etc is workload
saved by each frame or must you start
all over so this is from again the quad
GPU video where we were run using
blender to render an animation and the
the answer here is it depends how you
render it so we render in PNG s
basically each frame is rounded out as a
single file PNG file they're pretty big
sometimes 30 or 40 megabytes something
like that you end up with hundreds of
number thousands of them depending on
how long the animation is you drop it
into something like premiere and then
create the video that way where premiere
will just export it as an mp4 whatever
you want you could technically render it
as a video file which I think I did once
but the problem with that is like this
user points out if you render a video
file for something that's going to take
you 30 hours to render you better hope
that Windows doesn't update in the
middle of it or something else like a
power failure because then you have to
start over so generally people render
out single frames and then just put them
all together and some Psalter at the end
and create the video that way that was a
good question next one is from inversion
who says why are thermal pads preferred
over their own paste this from discord
for V RMS and MOSFETs on the GPU and/or
CPU and is there any damage that can be
caused if paste were used on the V arms
and MOSFETs instead I guess so builds or
jumped in there to talk about this one
briefly and it's I'm more or less going
to say the same thing a lot of it is
because MOSFETs are irregularly sized
and shaped they come in all different
types of sizes and Heights and it's
general I guess how densely packed the
MOSFETs together so just easier to put
it their own pad on there it'll work
with pretty much everything and also the
thickness matters because their own page
you can really only get so thick before
it just doesn't really work anymore and
a lot of the times it Heights between
the cooler and the MOSFETs is great
enough that you'd want to use that we
used like a point 5 or a 1.0 millimeter
thermal pad or something just because
it's for sure you're going to make
contact and whatever extra there is what
access will just compress on the service
as you apply force so I think that's a
lot of it and probably some kind of
manufacturing reasons too but largely
it's thermal paste isn't thick enough a
lot of the time and then MOSFETs are all
kinds of shapes and sizes so you just
order all your thermal pads you cut them
to some base size or a PCB and you throw
them on there and that's why a lot of
the time you'll see if they're all pads
and put like bleeding over into places
where they actually don't need to be any
on some cards because they have bought
the thermal pads for a different design
cut them and they just happen to fit on
this one as well so why not use it
because it's cheaper to do that than to
change your spec or change your supply
or something to that effect next
question is from tpv this one's kind of
interesting TV said is there any
information on how watching a youtube
video at two times speed affects a
channels profitability not sure how it's
calculated figure eight my mess with
metrics you know I was curious about
this so the way YouTube does a lot of
stuff now is watch time I think ad
revenue ties into that as well so with
watch time generally speaking the longer
people watch videos the higher average
watch time you have I think with YouTube
red or something you get a bigger share
of user X's YouTube red allowance per
month I'm not actually sure how that
works but to answer this question my
guess is if you watch that design speed
and you see the whole video I think
YouTube just sees it as ten minute video
or whatever I don't think it's easier
that's five but I'm not positive on that
I would I would hope and assume that it
sees it based on video length and video
seconds not real seconds and real video
length because then that would that
would just seem kind of kind of screwy
if people are watching stuff at design
speed it really suck but I don't think
that's the case I'm pretty sure you just
get paid based on the video like actual
seconds in the video consumed not sure
though but ultimately not a huge deal
that question is our last question is
from metric on who said
this is also on a YouTube how many
people actually work cameras Nexus Steve
is obviously the host of the channel and
most of the articles on the websites
indeed written by him I don't know if
someone else tests the hardware and he
writes the articles so who else is there
besides him a cameraman maybe someone
else to run the test and the cat no no
hate just honestly curious not sure why
I'd be hateful so I yeah I host the
stuff and then we've also got Andrew
does the video work actually if you look
in the description or the bottom of the
articles it'll have like a byline where
it's got like the author and then
additional reporting and testing or
camera works things like that but Andrew
does the camera and editing a lot of it
Keegan does some of the Cameron editing
when we're travelling Patrick Lathan
does a lot of the benchmark and Recife
use these days he's written a couple of
CPD reviews this year and some of the
revisits like by 7:00 9:30 revisit
article was written by him and then we
take a lot of that data and put it into
the video script as well and then Eric
Hamilton helps collect news for the the
news recaps we do every week and he also
writes some of the articles and then
we've got a couple of Ryan helps with
some of the articles as well the weekly
sales round ups on the website then
we've got a couple of less frequent
contributors so employees contractors
contributors are all part of the company
it's just a matter of how frequently is
this stuff posted by that person and you
know is it is a day behind the scenes
type of job or is it something that's
got their name on the article byline if
they wrote the article but yeah but the
core core teams basically Andrew Patrick
and I'm working on stuff too and then
we've got contractors helping out with
