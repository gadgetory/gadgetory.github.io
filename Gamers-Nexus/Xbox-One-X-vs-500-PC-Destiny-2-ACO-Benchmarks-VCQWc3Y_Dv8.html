dates back to the 70s or something like
that and it's been long discussed by the
wisest and most scholarly commentaries
on the youtubes as we know it today so
it's time to visit PC versus console I
hesitate to use the word vs. because
both have completely legitimate use
cases in the real world there are valid
reasons to buy both of them
unfortunately anyone who's already
paused this video and started typing a
comment doesn't agree with me and they
hate all of you regardless so I can't do
anything to stop that I'm sorry I asked
you not to engage however we can look at
some basic benchmarks of console vs. PC
in the confines of relatively equalized
settings for the two games we tested
this is all kind of still in the
research phase but it's kind of fun and
it gives us a baseline for analysis of
what does an equivalently price PC do if
we match the settings between just
Assassin's Creed origins and destiny -
this video is brought to you by the
gamers Nexus anti-static mod mat our mod
mat uses a high quality anti-static
surface with a rubberized finish we also
have a custom paint job on it which
includes reference points and cheat
sheets for PCIe eps 12 volt and other
power cables along with quick reference
throw paste application guides a screw
sorter for your video card tear downs
and it includes a common ground point
and a grounding strap to help protect
the products you are working on from
electrostatic discharge preorder your
mat now at the link in the description
below given the recent insane Toland
surge in prices for DRAM and GPUs the
argument is more poignant than ever
because now you're looking at pcs that
are pretty hard to build for affordable
prices it's unfortunate we don't like it
either
and it kills a lot of the budget build
videos but it is what it is and we can't
do anything about it so DIY PC is stands
to potentially lose some market share or
at least stop growing in their existing
high growth capacity while we recover
from the high DRAM prices see previous
video and high GPU prices see previous
video so we thought we'd use our new
in-house software to benchmark
a low npc and an xbox one axe roughly
priced the same and see how they do
together this is something where you're
gonna have to work with us on the
pricing of the components because they
change and I don't know what they're
gonna be when this video goes live but
they were about five hundred to five
hundred fifty dollars for the PC when we
filmed the video let's get a specs table
on the screen this is an experiment that
we started back before the pricing
surgeon everything on the market at the
time we were able to price out a $531 PC
after rebates with a $157 gtx 750ti a
$90 B 250 motherboard a G 4560 and some
other parts we'll put the components up
on the screen but again all of this is
sort of killed by the pricing and again
the point of this video isn't to say PC
is better than console or vice versa
because those are stupid short-sighted
arguments and anyone arguing otherwise
in the comments section is blinded by an
unhealthy fervor for whatever they're
arguing for so let's just kind of
establish something here there's a good
reason to attempt to analyze the
performance of each device there's a
good reason to look at just a small
sample size of two games we're still
researching our testing tools and it
allows us to see what's a baseline
performance for each of these given the
current price market pcs of course are
fully customizable of course you can use
them for work you can use them for
development video editing really
whatever you want for the most part and
tonsils have expanded their horizons but
they're still largely driven on media
consumption rather than creation or work
the console has a perfectly valid use
case in its target audience you set it
up you plug it into the TV you sit down
and you play your game pretty
straightforward not everyone wants to
build a computer not everyone really has
even the idea that you can build a
computer it's just there's something you
go to the store and you buy for $300 and
use it for Chrome for some people so
yeah valid reasons for both there are
many ways to build a PC you can build a
cheaper one than we did here however the
prices are crazy and
they changed everyday you could you go
used and get a 980ti or something like
that you could get a cheaper motherboard
it's kind of irrelevant when $200 GPS
don't exist but you could still do it
but anyway let's get through some
testing methods here and then get to the
benchmarks so we did capture footage of
60fps meaning each frame is on the
screen for roughly sixteen point six
seven milliseconds that's that's about
how long it takes for the GPU to spit
out the next frame if it's going to be
output at 60fps the games we tested are
v synched and they're capped at 30fps
that's a thirty three point three
millisecond frame time and on the Xbox
one that means our footage should always
see one unique frame followed by one
duplicate frame as long as nothing goes
wrong
assuming a 30fps output versus a 60fps
capture speed so if you follow it's
really pretty simple it's if we're
putting out 30 FPS because that's what
the developers locked it to and we're
capturing at 60 then when tapping
through the footage you're gonna see
unique duplicate unique duplicate unique
duplicate and anytime you see unique
duplicate duplicate that means we've
dropped the frame and from there we can
start investigating and see how
frequently does the Xbox drop frames in
this scenario is it a problem does the
user ever realize it so that's kind of
what we're looking at from the Xbox's
perspective now this means that if we
see three identical frames in a row it
means the Xbox took roughly 50
milliseconds to render a frame rather
than what it should have taken so that's
kind of the basics here if we see four
in a row which is fairly uncommon it
means it took sixty six point six seven
milliseconds to render frame and so on
and this can be translated back into a
more relatable FPS value an average one
percent in point one percent lows as
we've been doing forever with GPUs so
really quickly let's talk about some of
the challenges of this type of testing
number one graphics Equalization pcs
have variable settings consoles
generally speaking do not they are fixed
setting the first step that we had to do
for each game which is why we only have
two right now is go through the settings
one by one find things in the game and
compare them and see what settings look
about equal between each
that takes a good amount of time because
there's a lot of settings you have to go
through each individually and then we
need to set them so that the PC looks
the same as the Xbox so that we are
testing apples to apples in terms of
graphics quality dynamic resolution
scaling is another major challenge with
the Xbox the PC unless you tella - does
not do this very few games supported the
ones that do don't really work properly
or require a lot more vram than we have
on this card so dynamic resolution
scaling is the way the xbox is able to
depend on how you look at it sort of
cheat its way to run in 4k because
sometimes it'll run 4k and then you hit
a really rough frame for it to render
maybe there's a lot more geometric
complexity unusual and suddenly it'll
drop down to some odd resolution between
4k and 1080p or somewhere in there and
so your rendering for your pixels you're
sampling fewer pixels and you're able to
render at a higher framerate and meet
the target of 30fps or whatever it may
be so that is a huge challenge because
if we're testing a fixed 4k on the PC
because we can't do dynamic resolution
scaling or it's not functional or
disabled for the card then you're
testing that against dynamic resolution
on the Xbox potentially it's not really
fair so the best thing we can do is 4k
on the PC maybe 1440 if it's available
we try dynamic resolution and that's
what we have for our comparison you
really just have to kind of mentally
look at it and make an analysis on your
own and not just look at the chart and
then repeat those numbers on Reddit as
if they are absolute fact 100% of the
time so hopefully people who need to see
that have seen that another couple of
small things pcs can always adapt by
lowering graphics quality so yes if you
see a bad framerate obviously you would
drop the resolution to 1080 on a 1050 TI
at 4k but we're primarily testing that
because it's a it's a direct comparison
we do have other numbers though debate
over 60fps potential with lower settings
versus lower FPS with equal settings
there's another thing to consider where
on a PC you can go up to 60 plus FPS by
lowering resolution do you prefer that
or do you prefer the higher visual
quality with a lower frame rate
potentially granted by a console that's
up to you and that's subjective so
ultimately it comes
down to what you want this is a
subjective thing at the end of the day
we can test it but yourself to decide do
I want to sit on a couch with an xbox or
do I want to build an HT PC or something
instead that's up to you we'll detail
more of the testing methods in the
article below
but let's roll through destiny - for now
we've done a lot of destiny - testing
even during the beta and it's proven
itself to be a surprisingly undemanding
title on higher graphics settings the
first challenge of testing each game was
trying to roughly emulate the Xbox ones
of visuals on PC to make FPS comparisons
fairer digital foundry reported that
destiny - on the Xbox one X runs at
native 4k without dynamic resolution
changes and we haven't seen anything in
our testing that contradicts that the
fov on the Xbox version from what we saw
does however appear to be about 10
degrees of less than the PCs default 85
for which we have comparison screenshots
the difference appears to be an overall
F of V reduction of about 10 degrees as
opposed a strictly horizontal or
vertical FOV reduction here are some
side-by-side comparisons of our Xbox and
PC settings the final PC settings we
settled on aren't perfect and PC does
have a slightly higher environment
detailed distance and perhaps slightly
lower quality shadows but they're close
enough for a fair contest it's difficult
to perfectly match settings as the
console and PC versions do ultimately
have some development differences for
which we cannot account and we found
that destiny - on Xbox one x roughly
equates 4k resolution 75 fov fxaa
and disabled or low ambient occlusion
settings texture quality appeared to be
set to the highest setting on the Xbox
which makes sense given that this is
entirely a VRAM dependent setting and
the Xbox has plenty of that to go around
shadow quality appeared to be about low
or one level up and most of the other
settings appeared to be around medium
our first comparison was in the part of
destiny - we've used in the past for CPU
benchmarking at a different resolution
though with different settings and the
very first part of the first level with
all the fire and the burning to
contribute to lighting and shadows is
where we start it's not an overly
demanding area and we don't enter combat
during this particular benchmark but
there are some flames and lighting
effects to deal with so here's that
first chart the Xbox handled this
admirably never dropping any frames
during logging and maintaining a
rock-solid 30fps which is the best it's
allowed to do regardless of resolution
the budget PC with no frame rate cap or
vsync managed a nearly identical average
of 29 point 6 FPS call it the same but
with 0.1% drops down to 21 point 1 FPS
4k is a huge demand make of a 1050 Ti
and in a way of surprising to see a PC
that cost less than most 4k monitors
even managing to roughly keep up at all
keep in mind that at 1080p we easily
double this fps it just comes down to
how much you value 4k it's unlikely that
any PC player on a 1050 Ti would
reasonably be attempting to play the
game at 4k but the destiny 2 version of
the game on Xbox is genuinely 4k and we
wanted these tests to be about equal so
it doesn't seem to be leveraging dynamic
resolution in this case at least not
according to our counterparts at digital
foundry and again we didn't see anything
to counter that either the second test
was running back and forth on the farms
soccer field without any other players
present there's more foliage and distant
level detail to handle than the first
test and results were recorded during
the winter event with some snow falling
but there still are no NPCs or players
on screen again the Xbox had absolutely
no trouble with this not a single frame
was dropped in any of the test passes
and there were many and the hub level
would be more performance intensive if
we benchmarked with other players around
but that adds too many uncontrolled
variables for a reliable test
we'll have combat tests in a moment to
make up for this on PC average FPS was
almost the same as in the first test it
handles the grass and trees pretty well
and the 1% in point 1% lows aren't
dramatically lower than the average
performance isn't too distant in this
particular test the neon-lit
alley filled with enemies at the start
of the campaign is the first really
demanding segment of the game rain is
everywhere explosions go off their
flamethrowers multiple enemies spawn
it's representative of the demands a
destiny to set peace can place on a
system the Xbox is still averaged 30 FPS
here but for the first time some frames
were actually dropped you can see this
if we tab through the video file one
frame
at a time where a few dips emerge as we
repeat a couple of extra frames the
previous frame is displayed during a
frame drop and the GPU gives up and
moves on to the next immediate frame
trying to catch up there were only a
couple of dips during the run but it is
possible to force the frame rate to drop
under 30 fps just by playing in an area
like this one to be fair the dips were
basically imperceptible during gameplay
you don't necessarily see them but they
are still present the PC also had a
harder time than in the first two
benchmarks and the framerate began to
get in the way of gameplay again the 1%
in point 1% lows were fairly close to
the average and there weren't any
individual big hitches it just slowed
down a lot in general so one note here
destiny - and most other FPS games does
genuinely have a noticeable sort of
ingress and visual quality as you
increase framerate the PC isn't capable
of a high frame rate at 4k here so
doesn't really matter but if you go down
to 1080p there is genuinely a noticeable
difference at 60fps versus 30fps and if
you can't see it then I don't know what
to tell you but there is a noticeable
difference unfortunately you have to
drop the settings so the Xbox is doing
very well here the PC is pretty much
keeping up but it does kind of lose that
home-field advantage that an Xbox has
where you have developers develop for a
single piece of hardware or very close
to it they're all Xboxes with the same
architecture develop for that one piece
of hardware optimize shaders for that
one piece of hardware it's obviously
going to be a bit ahead than an equally
priced PC for the most part
notwithstanding settings optimizations
and things like that
we're overclocking or anything else of
that nature so they both do pretty well
here the Xbox is definitely admirable
for its 4k ability in this particular
title the PC would do much better if you
dropped resolution and increased frame
rate that's where it shines more than
with the sort of cinematic style that
the Xbox is going for Assassin's Creed
origins is now
it's a trickier title for the Xbox to
mimic on the PC since the Xbox version
takes advantage of dynamic resolution
changes frequently it uses them
generously in fact lowering resolution
on-the-fly will increase frame rate and
the PC version can technically also use
dynamic resolution but it's a feature
that requires more vram than we have on
the card a 1050 Ti only has 4 gigabytes
in this instance the Xbox 1x has 12
gigabytes of shared memory we ended up
leaving most settings at the high preset
but with medium character texture detail
low anti-aliasing and medium shadows we
then did a test at the 4k resolution
with dynamic resolution on and a frame
rate target of 30 FPS we also did a
final test with no dynamic resolution at
1440p to see what the PC could do at a
more reasonable resolution but still
higher than what probably most 1050 TI
users would be playing at you'd probably
be at 1080 this game is also known to
like higher core count CPUs so it's
potentially unfair to show with the G 45
60 that said we're still trying out our
tools here so this is the one we wanted
to test the first test is during an
in-game rendered cutscene the cutscene
in question is at the start of the game
the cutscene is rendered in game and
features some intense depth of field
effects detailed character models and
lighting through a doorway and from
candles we were assuming that this would
prove it stressful to the Xbox based on
the framerate dips we'd observed earlier
in smaller cutscenes but for the most
part it's tucked to 30 FPS every time
the camera switches position on the Xbox
however it would freeze for a couple of
frames which is why the point 1 percent
low is so far below 30 it does have an
actual freeze just before the camera
angle change you don't generally notice
that but if you're hypersensitive maybe
you would on PC it was like watching a
slideshow the average FPS was below the
Xbox's 0.1% low dynamic resolution
didn't help at all again we didn't have
the recommended vram but lower in the
resolution to 1440p doubled the average
FPS even more at 1080p we were correct
and thinking that this was a demanding
scene but the PC had a much harder time
with it
combat is where we experienced framerate
drops in Assassin's Creed origins during
our last batch of tests previously when
we did the first Xbox
testing we've refined our testing since
then but there are still definitely
quite a few drop trains detected we
chose the first fight against multiple
NBC's immediately before gaining the
ability to summon amount it's not an
extreme example but there are four to
five characters including the player on
screen at all times
the Xbox did fairly well considering its
framerate cap but the 0.1% and 1% lows
indicate some slight hitches during the
fight just like we saw in our initial
round of tests although it was a
different scene with different
characters on the screen the 1% and
point one percent lows are close
together here and that's because more
than a couple frames took too long to
render at 4k the PC struggled with
dynamic resolution on or off and
comparing frame rates below 30fps is
fighting for scraps even so the pcs
average is again below the Xbox's point
1 percent low at 1440p the frame rate
doubles as it did previously but this
time that boosts the average to 41 point
4 FPS more than what the Xbox is capable
of even when it's performing at peak
performance which is 30 FPS this test is
a brief clip of running down a crowded
Street in the first town introduced in
the game there are NPCs everywhere and
plenty of environmental details like
buildings and plants to deal with these
are the frame rates that can be expected
when wandering around in the open world
which is quite frequent the Xbox results
are basically identical to those from
the combat test this could be due to
dynamic resolution kicking in to
equalize the frame rates though we do
see drops in resolution as we play so
you're never really gonna dip that far
below 30 even though typically it would
be doing so average PC frame rate within
without dynamic resolution is slightly
lower than in the combat test lowering
resolution of 1440 P again boost the pcs
average FPS above the 30 FPS console
kaif this half step between standard
1080p and 4k uhd is a strong point for
the PC since assassin's creed origins
just doesn't go above 30 FPS on the Xbox
even at 1080p and this scene is one we
discovered by accident at one point
early in the game the player is required
to smash down a wall to proceed if a
mace is used in this area clouds of dust
shake down from the ceiling and the
camera shakes violently as the framerate
visibly drops it doesn't appear to be
the intentional pause on hit effect that
some games you
since the effects aren't nearly as
pronounced when fighting enemies on the
Xbox average framerate was twenty eight
point seven fps and that's while going
wild with the mace and the average is
still high because nothing stressful is
happening between each hit that said the
point one percent lows are when the
particle clouds appear and that averages
out to twelve fps and that is visibly
noticeable to the player even without a
framerate counter on PC the average was
also higher than it was in walking or in
cutscene benchmarks thanks to the mostly
empty backdrop the one percent point one
percent lows hit that slideshow level
that the cutscene did 1440p again is
much more tolerable but the low is still
bottomed out as dramatically as they did
on the Xbox from the perspective of a PC
hardware site obviously we do tend to
favor pcs for most things that said we
can still appreciate where the Xbox does
well for this particular test we would
never expect a user to actually play 4k
on a 10 50 TI the cost of the monitor
would exceed the cost of your computer
that's crazy
someone could certainly try it but it's
not recommended where the PC shines
because they both have things are good
at is higher frame rates by just
matching the settings to get the FPS you
want that's the beauty of it you can
tweak it to do whatever you want it to
do for the most part given the hardware
that you have so you can hit 60fps you
can go down to 1080p you can get above
60fps you can drop settings you don't
care about but have a huge impact on
performance all kinds of stuff that you
can do with a PC you can't do with the
Xbox that said with the Xbox you set it
up you click Play and you start hitting
things with the button on the joypad and
that's about the end of it so there is
value to both of those things the Xbox
certainly does do a bit better at 4k a
lot better in Assassin's Creed but we
only have a sample size of two games
here destiny - they keep up pretty well
with each other point 1 percent and 1
percent lows are a bit lower on the PC
but the average does more or less keep
up Assassin's Creed origin the PC Falls
quite a bit behind until you go down to
1440p at which point it begins exceeding
the consoles even capable framerate when
it's performing that maximum performance
so that's kind of the takeaway here the
straight
of a cheap PC isn't that it's the best
at running games is that the settings
can be adjusted to the point where it's
capable of running the games the $500
available for either a PC or an Xbox
right now because the prices with PC is
yes an Xbox will probably get you
potentially slightly higher graphics
settings may be probably a bit higher
graphics settings but you're not going
to hit the frame rate higher than
whatever the game is capped at your 30
or 60 fps that's it probably 30 so yes
you get higher graphics quality but you
get lower frame rates with a PC they're
expensive right now yes you could down
spec to $500 kind of sucks to do but
because you can adjust the resolution
and graphics you can go above 60fps the
question to ask yourself of course is
what do you want do you want the
experience of building a computer and
doing it all yourself all the DIY stuff
tuning settings all I mean we think
that's fun obviously not everyone does
buy a console if you don't that's kind
of what it comes down to there's plenty
of other arguments either way click the

gotten a lot more refined over the
