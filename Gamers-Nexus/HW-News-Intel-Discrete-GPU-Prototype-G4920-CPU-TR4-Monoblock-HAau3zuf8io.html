this week we're talking about Intel's
unveiling of their discrete GPU which is
still probably several years away but
they have a prototype that they just
showed off at an I Tripoli conference
also be talking about some Intel
accidentally leaked CPUs on Newegg oops
that include the G 4900 series G 4900 G
4920 we've got some news on AMD
components on a Windows upgrade and on a
cryptocurrency security vulnerability in
one of the popular wallets for any of
you who use those we've got a couple of
other things as well before we get into
that this video is sponsored by Dollar
Shave Club makers of the new five-dollar
shower shave starter set the kit
includes the Dollar Shave Club executive
razor bearing the hips of any high
quality tool and also includes
reloadable cartridges the five dollar
kit includes everything you see on the
screen now like the body wash and shave
butter and can be refilled for a few
dollars a month this deal is available
for $5 exclusively using our link below
or dollarshaveclub.com slash gamers
Nexus let's start out with some GN site
news we published a pub G graphics
analysis and frame rate benchmark for
the Xbox one act so even though this is
a console we think a lot of you would be
interested in this because it
specifically uses some new software that
we developed for frame rate analysis
that we can apply towards PC in the
future and we also do some technical
explanations as to different types of
graphics anomalies that we saw like for
example when the normal maps were
glitching out at glancing angle is
underneath the parachute or when we
talked about static versus dynamic
particle mass replacement on some of the
fences and how they're scaling was wrong
so it may interest some of you if only
from a graphical technical graphical
standpoint but we are moving some of
this technology towards our PC
benchmarking in the future at some point
so check that out it's on the channel if
you're interested starting us out Intel
published some slides at an I Triple E
conference it was the I Triple E
solid-state circuits conference and this
primarily highlighted a prototype 14
nanometer discrete GPU that the company
is working on for the distant future
this model uses a multi chip approach to
graphics process
saying it's a prototype for now which
means that you can't derive anything
from it we don't know if it's gonna be
low end or high end consumer or AI we
have no idea at this time but it is a
functional prototype and it's the first
thing that Intel's shown in the discrete
GPU region since they hired Roger Kaduri
and actually since many years before
that so this is probably not a product
that could already had much hand in at
all because he is a recent hire and it
takes a long time to make these things
but we do suspect to see more of his
influence going forward as Intel
continues to work on its discrete GPU
division which he is now a part of of no
Intel's i Tripoli slide shows a complete
graphic system as they call it has a 14
nanometer silicon component which
contains a low-power GPU a system agent
component and a configuration and debug
path this is mounted to an FPGA board
which then communicates via PCIe to the
host and the test chip is sized at just
8 millimeters by 8 millimeters making it
clear again that this is a very simple
prototype it also totals 1.5 4 billion
transistors in that area so we can't
really drive much from it other than
they're showing off some of the basic
capabilities the GPU voltage is
regulated through an integrated voltage
regulator similar to the fiber of Intel
CPU architectures for the prototype
frequency is operating at 50 megahertz
or 0.51 volts or 400 megahertz for 1.2
volts one of the main focal points for
Intel's of presentation was on faster
turbo 2 under Bo transitions which will
theoretically aid and limiting power
consumption and then we'll have more on
this later probably a couple years it'll
be a while before this makes it any kind
of market but they've got a prototype so
that's kind of exciting to see another
vendor get into the GPU space we'll see
what part of the space they compete and
ultimately but it'd be nice to see more
choice at least in consumer although
they're probably targeting something
like AI and enterprise first on the
topic of Intel this is a quick one a few
new coffee like s cpu SKUs were
accidentally posted early to new egg
including an unintentional reveal of the
forthcoming G Series Pentium CPUs these
include the G 900 ng 920 which were
previously mentioned but not detailed
these are the
radically based on new eggs listings
priced at around fifty two dollars for
the G forty nine hundred and sixty six
dollars to the G 4920 we know the G 4900
will be a two core two thread CPU with
two megabytes of l3 cache and the G 4920
will run the same specs though
presumably with a different frequency
there are rumors out there for the
frequencies but nothing's been confirmed
yet and meanwhile the i5 8,500 and I 580
609 k sea views were also posted early
both of which will run six core six
thread configurations with nine
megabytes of l3 cache one more Intel
adjacent story before moving on to AMD
components this is about gigabytes z 370
ultra gaming motherboard it's a board
that we've lamented since we got it it's
it's really it was okay but it was never
a very good at over clogger it had some
other issues I had coil line issues that
were more noticeable than on other
platforms so since the launch of z3 70
gigabytes been working on revising that
board and now they have an ultra gaming
2.0 coming out so this is a completely
new version it's not just a revision of
the existing ultra gaming it's actually
ultra gaming 2.0 and the changes include
primarily an increase in the phase count
that going from seven total phases to
eleven with the new version and they're
also improving a couple of other things
so for example a few of the additional
changes include an extra m dot 2
heatsink towards the top and more
importantly better chokes that should be
useful for theoretically reducing coil
whine that we observed in the earlier
model price will land at around $160 not
a huge change in price and the name is
officially Ultra gaming 2.0 if you're
looking for it these changes should help
address some of our initial concerns
although the heat sinks on the VRMs
really aren't any better than previously
but the rest the concerns are at least
getting something of a look in liquid
cooling news EK has announced a socket
TR for monoblock compatible with two msi
x 399 motherboards these include the
gaming a pro carbon AC and the sli plus
boards the co plate covers the entire
thread refer i HS and cools the VRMs
also and from pictures it appears that
the fin area does completely cover the
cpu dies this
so this was a bit of a misstep from ek
previously where the first thread refer
block didn't have enough microphones to
cover even the the die surface area on
the CPU so they provides that this mono
block covers more of the surface area of
the CPU it covers the entire die area
and it should cool better overall also
of note it does look like the block
contains a removable RGB LED strip if
that's something you're into and it's
compatible with Emma size mystic light
software and then pricing it's looking
like one hundred twenty six euros or
about 140 USD this one's short and is
from Microsoft there's a new power mode
and Windows at least four windows
insiders using Windows 10 Pro 4
workstations and that mode is called
ultimate performance mode it'll soon be
available for those on the windows
insider path and it's designed to quotes
eliminate micro latency is associated
with fine-grained power management
techniques this is specific to the
workstation and Enterprise editions of
Windows 10 for now and we don't know if
it'll come out for desktop or if it's
even necessary but if it does well
straightly benchmark it for purposes of
our benchmarks if you're curious we
typically use the high performance power
plan unless we specifically state
otherwise for some other reason like
testing power saving or something like
that but for high performance you do
want the high performance power plan
however it does obviously use a bit more
power than would typically be necessary
for low load scenarios for workstation
users though now you'll have another one
and workstations don't really care as
much about power anyway this one is some
security news our colleagues over at
Tech Age have discovered a security
vulnerability in the Jack's
cryptocurrency wallet which they've
detailed fully in their article at Tech
age comm the article goes on to
demonstrate that the Jack's wallet
creates a cache folder on the host
system which can then be copied and
pasted to any other computer with the
jacks wallet software without requiring
any sort of password at all this cache
folder can then be copied to the new
location used to access the currency
stored in the wallet and then the
attacker could send that currency to a
different wallet there's an optional
four-digit pin code as well that they
don't require you to turn on but you can
do it through software options
and from what we understand it's by
passable through other security exploits
and either way four digits gives you
about 10,000 combinations to attempt to
crack anyway even if you weren't using
exploits to circumvent the code as tech
gage shows in their video it would be
trivial for a user with access to the PC
it's a copy this cash holder and send
its currency to another wallet one
instance of such an exploit might be a
PC repair technician who has physical
access to the PC and therefore can grab
the folder and access it later
alternatively something like meltdown or
Spectre would make sense here as they
can use side-channel attacks again
access to memory and can be executed via
hijacked ad network JavaScript without
ever requiring physical access to the
computer just remote access tech gauge
details that exploit further in their
own content which we've linked in our
show notes for this episode found below
in the description also know our other
colleagues at Hardware unboxed posted a
video talking about Intel scalability
under different thermal conditions this
is close to home for us because we run
all of those case thermal benchmarks
where we can show throttling in some
instances and in Hardware unbox testing
they look at the stock Intel cooler with
a couple of other coolers to see how
turbo is affected under various thermal
circumstances and for that again you can
find a link in our show notes below for
another security news item relating back
to kind of the meltdown inspector stuff
from a moment ago Intel's expanding its
bug bounty program as a consequence of
the meltdown and spectre exploits it's
an invitation-only program that was
launched in March 2017 only a few months
before they were notified of meltdown
now the program is open to all security
researchers and bounties are being
raised across the board up to $100,000
in some areas and up to $250,000 in
other areas with a temporary program
specifically focused on side-channel
vulnerabilities like meltdown inspector
the intent is to encourage quote
coordinated disclosure or in other words
make sure Intel is the first to know as
rough as the past few months have been
it looks like Intel knows that they
dodged a bullet by having Google project
0 discover this and report
vulnerabilities to them first and
finally following EA's Star Wars
Battlefront 2 debacle which came between
EAS battlefront 1
and visceral games shutdown debacles the
rumor circulating now is that Lucasfilm
and Disney are looking for a new studio
to develop these Star Wars license the
source for the specified rumor is an
article from Cinna links which cites
Ubisoft and Activision as possible
contenders but doesn't offer much else
in the way of concrete statements
regardless ea stock prices have
continued to rise higher than ever
before with the reintroduction of
microtransactions to battlefront 2 so
it's clear just how far speaking with
here while it goes when it comes to EA a
battlefront 2 they did note
performed exceptionally poor League
versus the expectations given the whole
microtransaction fracas of sorts from
last year but they've reintroduced them
so that's what EA thinks of us all but
either way it's possible that the
license may be taken away from them so
we'll keep an eye on that it's all just
rumor right now but that's it for this
one as always you can check the link in
the description below to the article
containing show notes for this new
episode which will have sources and
things like that if you'd like to read
further on any specific topic including
those items from our colleagues at
various websites so subscribe for more
