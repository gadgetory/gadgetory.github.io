PC world hey everyone
Gordon you've been on this with me it
feels like for every major Lodge okay
talk about it through Intel we've done
and the discussion in the past but what
we're here to talk about now is an
internet comment oh okay all right
comment is Intel is screwed before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
grizzly and their high-end thermal
compounds thermal grizzly makes cryo not
paste for high thermal performance and
conductivity without being electrically
conductive so you don't have to worry
about shorting components cryo knot is
particularly good for replacing stock
GPU pastes as cryo knot is a non curing
compound learn more at the link in the
description below is Intel really screw
that's our topic today okay that all
right my hot tank on that yes but they
don't care yes desktop they're getting
their clocks clean
they're definitely losing the marketing
battle the perception war the perception
of cost although that's going to change
obviously a little bit but I do think
yeah I mean the excitement around ricin
is crazy and I don't know how to explain
it because AMD is successfully taking a
cpu which so many people don't get too
excited about if you've got all excited
about this launch like the first time
rise to kick around and then Zen plastic
got excite about so I think AMD is
kicking their butt on desktop so yeah
they're screwed because everybody wants
to line up and see what Rison is before
they make a purchase no everybody's like
I'm not gonna buy anything - I see
rising numbers from Steve here cuz he
knows something about or from guard on
that PC I don't think people care
because it's desktop and I love desktop
you love desktop we love desktop Coffee
Tex loves this up time Walt loves
desktop us loves this up everybody loves
desktop but nobody buys them you sound
like a Microsoft the entire hitting the
rap right now the entire world boy I'm
waiting for you guys Steve Ballmer Omni
star jump around but the problem is
desktop still don't move the needle
enough Intel's numbers our servers money
lots of money
margin
laptops servers got a lot of margin and
they move a lot of volume in laptops and
you notice intel says hey we got a new
eight core night Jen nothing much left
in it but it's getting a quarter right
it's a butt-kicking CPU there ain't no
AMD chip to compete with why do it right
because ambhi's our Intel it's not going
to just sit around on laptops let ambi
come up and clock them in the face yeah
on desktop they're like oh whatever you
got 12 cores we got a we got these bin
parts right where the five gigahertz I
thought that that launch was a little
weak I thought the night or the
announcement I had a KS yeah it's like
it's almost like an admission of we we
actually don't have anything what can we
what because it didn't even come out the
show it's coming out like end of year so
it's like last week they're like oh no
what what can we do yeah I know I think
the thing is like look it surprised me
because I mean the K part was damn near
five gigahertz and EMC on manual to turn
on your it's you're getting it all core
overclock anyway I'll back it in the
motherboard so this is a better part
it's gonna over there bin you'll get
better clocks on but yeah it's not today
you're right that's in the air so but
they don't care if you don't care
legitimately that much about desktop not
enough that they need to proactively get
out there to be way in front because
they are so far in front in laptops aim
design Intel still just in terms of
comparative size between the two
companies financially Intel it's just so
so far larger than AMD you know like
it's larger than nvidia so intel's got a
really long way to fall yes i think to
really start feeling any any pain from
it and also to i should point out that
you're saying intel doesn't really care
that much about desktop there are people
at intel you clear a desktop so like
people in our audience shouldn't feel
completely neglected but intel as a
company certainly more focus on like
server and mobile right or a notebook
rather know i agree and that's those
areas they don't want to lose desktops
they knew they sort of lost when rising
came out of the way you know they sort
of it's been tough for them yeah really
hard slog so i you know and again i say
they don't care because that doesn't
mean intel is a prideful company folks
you don't get to be the size of Intel
unless you are prideful they just know
they don't have anything that really can
respond respond yet but I've been doing
this long enough you've been around this
long enough that Intel responds it may
not happen in 2019 it might not have it
happened in 2029 but you can damn near
bet when in tow comes out with their
response on desktop and they wanna beat
AMD it's gonna be this gonna be a
monster part I mean Intel certainly is
it's not like the company is incompetent
no and they have a lot of money and you
know money can solve a lot of problems
time is the the biggest lack of a
resource they have because AMD has been
able to seize the opportunity while
Intel's had a deficit in 14 nanometer
has had trouble getting 10 nano like all
of these bad things lined up at wants
for Intel and then Andy also launched a
pretty good architecture so it's like
you can't really ask for much more if
you're AMD I know it gets because I we
did a Q&amp;amp;A with the Lisa Sioux after the
keynote just a few of us and after the
whole thing else I went over and I said
they say wow you know I I go all the way
back to the original 1 gigahertz k7
because you know that slide they have
yeah k7 64-bit just all these incredible
milestones that AMD have and it's just
like how the hell you know basically
they come up and they they win something
and then they lose again but again how
do you get to the perfect storm where
Intel can't ship parts until doesn't
happen of course Intel cost more money
that perfect storm aside I was like this
is like it back to a future thing like
how did it get into a DeLorean and go
back and like sabotage that spot right
now yeah I mean it seems like it feels
bit for something up I mean how the hell
can they I mean I know it's like is this
luck or back to the futures well it's
not luck so she sort of confirmed - in
the future yeah AMD has a time machine
and confirmed it yes
Jordan confirmed it here PC world
exclusive
reports on you gamers Nexus mr. fusion
method nice
oh maybe they had one the end
overclocked a gigahertz or something
gonna 8.8 gigahertz 8.8 gigawatts
sticker watts gigahertz
yeah they figured no matter I'm just
amazing to think that AMD and I'm
gushing about them because I'm just
super impressed but no it's Intel
screwed yeah in the short term long term
no and fanboys you're out there if and
when Intel comes back to the part that
is really worthy that just simply smokes
ambi parts or at least is good enough
that you go like head-to-head
head-to-head and better price whatever
you have to at least then say this is a
good part you can't just be on your
fanboy fan wag oh we have this same
conversation at the Intel New York event
and I remember some of the comments I I
did some one of us did some devil's
advocate questions to the okay I ran
there was like a little bit of defending
some Intel decisions in there as part of
playing devil's advocate I remember some
of the couch like Gordon is an Intel
fanboy yeah Steve is an Intel fanboy and
you know Gordon you've said an awful lot
of good things about a.m. Jesus now died
I think you're starting to switch I
don't think because if I say the only
thing I said I yeah I know I hear ya you
gotta be careful Gordon when you say
something good you have to also punch
them in the face that's your fanboy
that's how the internet works well it
does but I again I did I said Intel's
losing all right we were to say I just
I'm only saying this because we wrote we
ran a video somebody who said
immediately we did a great cart prick to
our Channel I did a benchmark quake to
RTI that somebody was like oh my god the
MD was the the biggest thing in the show
was AMD and they haven't done anything
on it there obviously I know they say
like say gorgeous show yeah well what's
up where's AMD coverage it's like bought
out by Nvidia what I wasn't even
competing CP I know it's like you know
the truth is we were busy covering the
show guys live tweeting it writing about
it and we just didn't have time to do
video to be frank I didn't have actually
much video access there were no
motherboards there's
no other Performance Center if we didn't
have a chance to do we did other stuff
right we got we're doing that down we
guess we're talking about AMD how great
they are
so we'll immediately somebody jumped on
me and Sam a show so i i i just said
thinking the things ready talk but i
what can i well he'd been if you had if
you had to actually been chilling for
this lon
as a journalist I don't think you would
be here reporting right now baby
probably retired at this point yeah I
work with a fantastic editor Andrew
Sanchez way back in the booth days 1990s
god bless his soul and I remember
because he would like same thing it'd be
something like and this is deigning at
all
you're just a a TR Schiller that's three
Schiller you know whatever your uh oh it
was your who the effects yeah you're the
shiksa and he was like yeah okay
come on and look at my car in the
parking lot the paint's peeling yeah
they're so full of it yeah no no it is
not that way and I think people need to
realize word we tell you the truth as
best as we as we understand it so then
tell me the truth garden back to the
question how screwed is in town it
sounds like so to distill the answer it
sounds like short term Intel's in a bit
of trouble I'm the way I think about it
you can poke holes in this if you want
you can be the content the way I think
about it is right now Intel isn't a bit
of trouble like so we were talking about
this on your stream I was on the PC
world podcast full nerd right yeah and
we're talking about how well I v Intel
kind of lost that to the r5 is a bit ago
yeah I I Pfizer dead right
yeah and then i7 kind of did okay but
has now been challenged in the 2000
series and now I nines been this like
last bastion of hope we're in the very
least if you're thinking about building
a PC and you're like I just want the
best but not h EDT you could still point
someone towards my dad okay so now is
that is that changing is Intel starting
to lose that I don't I
I'm gonna say my gut is yes what I've
seen so far says that big minus
right let's say you know people burned
your ass over this - right low visual
quality non GPU bound loans Intel AMD
but why is it original lot rising
especially well and even at 1440p Evo
we've done more yes teen on it and Intel
still on the we'd like in some cases
significantly yeah yeah do you go have
to like for kak yeah okay now we're
lovely but anyway you were saying
no but ended but it's they have when you
say what's the best gaming secret we
unabashedly say 9900 K sure yeah sure I
don't know if that's going to be true
when we say when we see rise in 3000
because if the clock speeds are there if
the IPC is there and you the mitigations
are there which is not going to really
affect gaming now and they're so close
that it doesn't matter if you're talking
to 5% 15% 20% and almost everything at
1440p yeah that's that's something worth
adding up counting up in your in your
spreadsheet but if it's equal then yeah
99 2k it's not gonna have much to go to
because they losing core count if gaming
single third performance is so close
it's a blur they sell still has
frequency if our yeah frequency but I
think the thing is some of the things I
showed off sort of implied that they're
close enough that it doesn't matter
right right alright I'm not sure right
cuz we got to see what 20 atti
we got some more titles but I mean how
much is it where it matters I will say
when you tell somebody 20 percent - 20
percent Verizon that's the truth yeah
you got to think about that if it's not
bad for rising three thousand then and
you get more multi-core performance
you're pretty sure whichever you for and
in some compiled workloads it's also
advantage right significantly video
encoding 3d rendering right compiling
great although there's some places where
so like Adobe Premiere in our testing
seems to be at least with the types of
videos we make it does seem to really
like Intel
yeah the point we're like Red River just
gets destroyed in it I mean an
eight-core in
well a query threat even intel part will
often do better than high-end Rison but
that's that comes down to application
level per Barnes tail now this is the
other thing now I know people are going
to scream you can say it's unfair but
Intel and I'm going to say something
positive about Intel now that's okay
guys you can't call me a shill for this
Intel has had people in the field for
twenty years they go to Adobe they go to
Microsoft they go to game developers
they go to that developer they work on
handbrake they're helping people tune
software for their CPUs like Gordon
that's underhanded and evil why so I I
understand why you would say that if
your Intel are they going to go out to
go tuned for their competition oh but I
want to be nice though intentionally
making it run bad uncompetitive parts
not as it is but I can't prove that you
can't prove that that is not fair you
can't just make that allegation put your
can of Budweiser down on the keyboard
and say see that's not proof you got to
have real proof that's one thing but if
they're going out and they're optimizing
for 18 core h EDT avx-512 loads for an
Adobe and it smokes thread work what are
you gonna tell somebody to buy right and
if they're gonna are thinking it really
gonna go oh well you know I'm not gonna
buy a cheek or a chibi G because it's an
unfair they did this unfair thing by
helping Adobe or whoever or da Vinci or
whatever am for program for I'll see
you're intentionally really good I mean
that's that's your decision you don't
have to do it you can you can ride a
bike or take a bus to work because you
want to save the planet that's cool
that's all your thing if I want to take
an f250 and Idol with their air
conditioning on and the windows rolled
down that's my thing
everybody wants to do their thing but
I'm just saying you can't do other
people in this analogy to be clear but
there's people I ain't ready for
premiere is an absolute 50 with the
windows rolled down but I don't use it
this
I'm saying it is not it's not it doesn't
matter like if you were doing a job for
living and they come to me they say
Gordon or Steve I'm I'm a freelancer I'm
doing home video projects I need to take
it to the next level
I would crap loads of course our premier
9999 1831 75 X both if you have money
you know both good parts so I mean but
you can't say like well you need to
consider the social concerns that AMD
doesn't have the budgets have been I
mean you can tell them that but you know
I need to be clear Andy is good at quite
a few things so we're not saying that I
guess is a premier targeted discussion
but they're targeted I'm just I've just
gone off the rails here but I just think
that people got to realize Intel goes
out and they optimize a lot of code for
their hardware at the end of the day if
somebody just wants faster do you care
the politics of it or you just care what
affects you your job is for a living
okay let somebody else fight that battle
of the Abbott's I just went from which
that's cool if you're into your I need
to support the little guy that's cool to
that that's nothing wrong with that yeah
so then short answer Intel and the
immediate future is in a bit of trouble
Intel is yeah they they're in a problem
there they're screwed right I'm sorry I
agree there's right now because so 30
minutes later we've answered the
question worth apartment at us or do we
even have parts I mean what supply now I
mean you have like an empty box versus
so yeah
but no I mean long term though this
isn't like the end of Intel no no a
that's again that'd be insane yeah
anybody thinks this is the end of Intel
no that's crazy right not RIT as the
kids say okay riff oh really
yeah you pronounce it I know I'm doing
it no wrong I'm doing wrong I'm too old
so Gordon you say this is not the end of
Intel I say it's not the end of Intel I
hope that in four years when Intel shuts
down and is completely gone we can come
back to this and say we're gonna say we
were so wrong we'll just come here and
we're just gonna have this look and you
could type comments
yeah we'll stand comfort over life so on
and say nothing and you can just type
comments about us
Wow that just brings me back to this
conversation happened with that bone 64
this is exact not we're not considered
but there were people back then and said
oh my god they're over they're gonna go
bankrupt right what really that's all it
didn't happen I know it didn't happen
then and they have a lot of money it's
not gonna happen and competition is good
empty doesn't want Intel they go out of
business they want intel to do well they
want Intel there I mean Intel yeah
creates a lot of technology they they
want competition and yeah and they
leverage each other a bit on something
to see like cross-licensing yeah and
they hope each other they really do
legitimately help each other because
yeah cross-licensing yeah research
research show to an open field yeah
classic Batman would be nowhere without
the Joker that's true it'd be one boring
ass comic without Joker yes yes that is
absolutely true and I'll mash positive
into house check out PC world will link
them below
Gordon's over there what's your title
editor in chief executive editor
executive editor so does that come with
Mike a cigar on a smoking job I wish I
wish I have a almost corner office I
have an ear in the car almost corner
cubicle oh nice yeah okay well you can
check Gordon out and his almost quarter
Cuban vault on PC world will link them
below Thank You Gordon for joining me
thanks we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
