hardware news recap for the past week
news in the hardware world got a few
cool topics for you today one of them is
a rumor which we try to stay away from
but this one is close enough to the
rumor that launch and release and
announcement dates that we'll talk about
it is the Intel I 9 series allegedly
we've also got a couple cases talked
about have some memory CPU coolers
motherboards and video cards hopefully
get all of that in fairly quickly in
rapid-fire format before that this video
is brought to you by course there's a
new vengeance RGB LED Ram which ships
with custom screens ICS for better
overclocking performance and stability
given that memory is highly relevant for
performance with new rise in CPUs now is
a good time to do research on high
performance kits start with the
Vengeance RGB LED kit at the link in the
description below let's start with a big
news item Intel and the alleged I 9
streets so these are obviously a
departure from the i7 is the best
nomenclature that Intel is used for a
long time now the AI nines are
reportedly going to be skylake X and
then there will be KB lekha X processors
as well which I've been rumored for some
time now but skylake X the big one to
talk about is the i9 at 79 20 X and that
is a 12 core 24 thread CPU of course on
Intel's architecture which is a bit
different from AMD's and it's also got
44 PCIe lanes this isn't a CDT CPU so
high-end desktop not meant for gaming
sort of like were the 1800 X's though it
would be reasonable to assume that the
79 20x will probably be more expensive
than that but we'll see it's also got
sixteen point five megabytes of l3 cache
and then there's the I 970 900 X not the
20 but a so 900 X which will go down to
10 cores and 20 threads so you lose two
physical cores and four threads with the
7900 x over that so 9:20 same PCIe Lane
count and the cache a bit different
because you lose some course and
actually you lose some cache that goes
down to thirteen point seven five
megabytes and again these are just
rumors but that we've got some initial
indications of what clock speed might be
on the 79
2x and for what we've seen online it's
looking like three point three to four
point five gigahertz abuse depending on
which turbo mode you're in which is
dictated by how many cores are boosting
simultaneously and the 79 20x doesn't
yet have a leak clock speed so can't
really do too many guesses on that
performance other rumoured Intel CPUs
include an AI 978 20 X 8 cores and 16
threads on that one
high 9 7800 X which is removed at 6
cores and 12 threads and then you have
your normal core i7 and core i5 series
refreshes those would be the ones that
most of us buy if you're in the
enthusiast crowd so the core i7 and i-5
refreshes are the 200 to probably $400
range devices that will compete most
immediately with the existing r7 and r5
lineup otherwise the rest is all h EDT
stuff so a.m. these got its own CPUs
coming out too
those two will probably go head-to-head
in the near future let's cover two of
the new cases that have been discussed
this week one of them is a Leon the PCO
11 ROG version of the case this is the
TCO 11 that we saw at Computex last year
but with the new Orochi certified
iteration of Sam chassis the biggest
changes come by a way of silk-screened
rog inspired design on the front panel
and a reshuffling of the internal layout
to have permits
three three hundred sixty millimeter
radiators aside from that PCO 11 ROG is
still a dual chamber case featuring
tempered glass and aluminum side panels
with support for up to e ATX
motherboards NGP is up to 430
millimetres CPU coolers fit up to 150
and there are four 2.5 inch bays 5 2.5
inch bays and an included PCIe riser
cable and if you're wondering about the
price on that one it is looking like 320
dollars but it's Leon Lee so what should
have been expected availability looks
like mid May which aligns almost
perfectly with Computex coming up we
will be there by the way so quick note
if you don't follow or haven't followed
our coverage for at least a year then
you might not know that we go to copy
text that's coming up it is in Taipei
Taiwan we will be there to cover all the
newest stuff including all kinds of
prototype
that may or may not ever make its market
so definitely stay tuned for that it's
really not more than about 10 days away
at this point yeah so we'll be there
last week we saw a Corsair enter the $50
cage market with its newest spec oh for
following the spec alpha previous case
and now it is cooler masters turn so
cooler master is launching their own 50
ish dollar case and that is the cooler
master master box light 5 we're hoping
to look at this one we'll see maybe at
Computex otherwise we'll grab a review
sample but this one the latest version
of the master box uses a translucent
glossy front panel and it's got
customizable trim for these colors for
the outside the case and four trim
locations on the case the customizable
trim includes 3d printing schematic so
you can grab those from Coolermaster
directly this is part of their master
blank series the master box master case
whatever master maker all that stuff
fits into the semi customizable solution
from cooler master so that will be
accompanied by 3d principle schematics
and other than that internally it can
fit motherboards from mini ITX to full
ATX not too abnormal their GPUs go up to
400 millimeter Seaview coolers up to 160
millimeters in height accommodating most
coolers on the market and then their
support for one 120 millimeter radiator
in the back of the case one 240 or 360
up front and then the storage is
supported at one 2.5 inch bay and a
combo of two 3.5 or 2.5 inch bays after
that master box the light 5 is looking
at availability from May 19th just
before Computex should be about $50 but
we're going to try and review it so
stick around for that and even even if
we don't it's $50 so it's not a huge
risk anyway but we will try to cover
that one Corsair announced this week the
availability of their newest high-end
memory modules
according to Corsair I seized our hand
at screened in these modules which are
dubbed the Corsair Dominator platinum
special edition torques ddr4 kit 3200
megahertz and it ships up to 32
gigabytes for about $400 but I seized
our hand of screen so they're
theoretically higher quality better
overclocking Headroom and each kit uses
a 10 layer PCB with integrated
aluminum heat spreaders that have been
painted quite a bit each stick has a top
bar that has the blue in effect that you
can see in our photo and that lends the
muscle car aesthetic that coursers going
for with these kits being special
edition each kit is that numbered
individually and they are rated to be
overclocked at least 230 600 megahertz
incompatible with the latest x99 and 200
series motherboards get into the CPU
cooler section now we've got three
coolers worth announcing from last week
we're talking about at least the first
one is the arctic freezer 33 Co this is
an air cooler it has a semi passive it's
it's a half passive half active solution
for cooling CPU so lower gdb then you
might get with some other stuff but the
freezer 33 CEO uses four six millimeter
heat pipes they are copper heat pipes
that's always these ones the Arctic has
gone ahead and specified that they are
filled with the ionized water how much
that matters I'm not sure normally they
have some sort of mix of ammonia
methanol and distilled water or
something like that they specify these
or deionized we'll try and talk to them
and see if there's any actual meaning to
that in terms of performance is a real
way to test so they are direct touch
copper heat pipes so they flatten out at
the bottom direct contact with the CPU
IHS and there are 49 total fins which
for some reason is specified and this
one 120 millimeter pwm fan is used for
the cooling that's got an f DB bearing
or DB I should say fluid dynamic bearing
and that has an extra oil reservoir in
it which means that hopefully it should
last a bit longer as well the fan by the
way does not operate if PWM signal is
below 40 percent so there's your half
passive version of this basically if
you're under under any kind of light
workload idle to web-browsing says
something like video viewing that it
should be pwm below 40 percent for the
most part so that's kind of like most
the video cards are these days other
than that spends up to 1350 RPM max it
comes with Arctic's own MX for thermal
compound and compatibility for sockets
am fors included Intel's included TP up
to 150 watts so that covers pretty much
everything in the those two categories
without accounting for extreme overclock
some things like that
retail looks like about $50 for this one
the next cooler is practical designs
Celsius series so that as 24
thirty-six we covered these on the
channel already we specifically review
the s 36 so if you're curious about it
go check there but basically these are
two new closed-loop coolers if you
missed it the very very short of it is
that they are a sip X applied they're
not that different from any other fifth
genatech product except for a few
features which is standard for all of
these really and the features on this
one that stand out are the semi open
loop design so that would be the G 1/4
fittings on the radiator side so you
could actually detach the radiator and
four if you needed to for some reason
he's at another loop there's also a fan
hub on the radiator which we talked
about in that content and the 360
version goes for 120 dollars the 240
millimeter version goes for 110 dollars
ultimately the performance is not
special on these it is basically the
same as every other is a tech made this
gen product of comparable sizes so this
is one of those you buy the one that's
cheapest and fits the aesthetic you want
these happen to be blackout with no LEDs
if you like that we've got a review for
you to check out and if you're not sure
about it check the review anyway because
we have some criticisms of these since
they were not all that unique for a late
case of exit generation product the last
cooler is a resin tech Lido CPU cooler
these coolers will be available in three
variants based on the LED illumination
of a fan they come in white red and blue
the cool uses a black anodized aluminum
fin stack fix two three eight millimeter
thick heat pipes that feature black
nickel plating the heat pipes are fixed
to the fin stack via solderless design
and the 120 millimeter fan is of the
sleeve bearing variety which spins at
800 rpm to 1800 rpm with up to 67 CFM of
air movement and a rating by spec anyway
of 29 DBA
the heat sink also allows for a
push-pull fan setup a cooler supports
all the expected Intel and AMD sockets
including a.m. for pricing is not yet
known on this one for motherboards this
week asus has two new boards in the
Intel lineup 200 series there's the H
270 I and B 250 I mini ITX boards these
should be a bit more affordable in
theory than some of the other izx boards
that they offer on a market
now those boards offer to m2 slot sees
in the pcie 3.0 for nvme interface or
protocol and for SATA 3 ports there's
support for rst as you might expect to
this point give an octane onboard dual
band 802 11 AC Wi-Fi is included along
with a single PCIe by 16 that slot with
Aurra
RGB lighting can't get away from that
this year the two models diverge a bit
on stata configurations USB connectivity
and raid options mostly due to the
different chipsets on offer being the B
and H series chipsets
for information or specs on the boards
check the official ACS website they've
already got pages for the products lots
of video card news from the past week as
well but we'll go through these pretty
quickly the first one is though tacks
1080i Arctic storm card this includes a
water block and if you've really seen
one of these 1080i so the water block
you've pretty much seen them all though
text it does not have a price yet it
should be more than $800 going by trends
with 1080 T eyes and it is using a base
of 1506 megahertz with a boost preset to
1620 though obviously they all boost to
whatever 3.0 dictates anyway so those
numbers are somewhat useless since
they're just bottom line validation runs
with whatever software may be used
normally per mark or something like that
or some other burn and software so
that's the Arctic storm not a whole lot
to say about it other than it's just
it'll have a water block as 0.3
millimeter micro channels G quarter one
quarter fittings can be adapted to 10
millimeter internal diameter flexible
tubing and that's pretty much it the
next one is the no.3 D single slot 1050
TI it's a 1050 TI and it's single slots
if you have an H CPC that calls for a
single slot config in o3d is looking at
releasing a card for that it's pretty
simple looking the fan is not that
impressive but if you look at it it's
pretty skinny fan because it's a single
slot cooler so they don't have a lot to
work with we're probably not going to
review that one but it's something to
look out for if you're in the market for
a single slot card and finally in video
card news there's a new water blocks
with sapphire rx 580 Nitro+ which is a
brand new card and that comes from an
Asia based company whose name I do not
know how to say it is byk sk
I so we're going to go with bike sky
water block comes from them and it is a
water block that uses a copper coal
plate with an acrylic top not too
different there it's got nickel plating
to prevent galvanic corrosion also
fairly standard and it is useful for the
rx 580 Nitro+ which is brand new one of
the only pre-built water cooling
solutions at least for that card so that
one's on the market as well or will be
soon NVIDIA voltage V 100 was discussed
at GTC this week we've got a video
talking about it already if you are not
up to speed on Volta and the
architecture the very basics have been
revealed to some minimum level of depth
enough to get interested and start
diving into things and then hopefully
we'll have white papers soon after now
that GTC has concluded so V 100 and the
Tesla V 100 accelerator were announced
this week $18,000 for one of them the DG
x1v is 150 grand it includes a few and
they're really targeted at deep learning
machine learning things like that F P 16
is 2 to 1 F P 30 to 1 to 1 F P 64 1 to 2
and they're not meant for us but
eventually both will come down to the
gaming mine just like DP 100 finally in
video cards the asus rog sli bridge was
announced previously but finally hits
the market this week so if you had your
eye on that one it should finally become
available
it's an ROG themed SLI bridge may is the
release month May 12th it looks like is
when they should hit availability and
the bridges support aura RGB lighting
resolutions up to 5 K which is actually
dictated by the bridge and and all the
normal stuff you would get from one of
the HB SLI bridges and a final very
quick news announcement was a new
display we normally include one of these
per week
this was the VG 27 275 Q from Asus it's
a new display 27-inch TN panel with a
resolution of 1080p at 75 Hertz we're
not going to talk about this a whole lot
but something to look at again if you're
in the display market one millisecond
great great response time 300 its
brightness and your standard set of
inputs price looks like it's going to be
around 300 dollars so that's it for this
week as always you get a patriot
I'm calm sighs gamers Nexus tops out
directly gamers Nexus net the follow
stuff as we post it live or store that
gamers Nexus net to grab a shirt like
these my thanks to Eric our writer for
the news and rounding it up for me you
can find more on the site subscribe for
more in video format I'll see you all
next time
