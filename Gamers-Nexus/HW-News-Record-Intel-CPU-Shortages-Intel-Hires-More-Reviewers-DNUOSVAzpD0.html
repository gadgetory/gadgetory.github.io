recap for this week we're talking about
more Intel acquisitions of technical
press this time Kyle Bennett from hard
OCP that was an unexpected one AMD and
the Radeon rx 560 XT a new video card
launched exclusively in China which we
just came back from DRAM price has seen
the steepest decline since 2011 some
good news there and then some records
shortages of Intel CPUs that are
producing unexpected results for 2019
before that this video is brought to you
by the mass drop and - man he4 x ax
planar magnetic headphones the he4 XX
headphones focus on high quality audio
listening experiences with comfortable
foam cushions for the ear cups comfort
is also ensured with a leather covered
spring steel headband allowing
flexibility and durability against bends
these headphones are capable of
delivering big sound for audio files
while being positioned competitively in
price learn more at the link in the
description below
quick Gyan news item first we just
restocked our two-tone lightweight
hoodies the ones that are perfect for
cooler weather and we restocked a lot of
them this time because you all have a
very high demand of those and we're also
doing a special discount code GN chill
at checkout that's G n Shi ll I suspect
you all know how to spell the word shill
since it's commonly posted in our
comment section below and now we are
using that phrasing against you so
here's GN shill at checkout you'll get
10% off of the lightweight hoodies and
they have the anniversary teardown
design on the back they've got a GN logo
on the front and they're pretty cool
blue and grey two-tone color design so
check those out on store doc gamers
nexus net alright so first real news
item Kyle Bennett leaving hard OCP for
Intel this was very unexpected
Kyle very much has always seemed like a
ride till you die type and I think
watching this he will agree with that
but some situations do require a bit
more nuance and in this one Intel has
hired a lot of the technical press over
the past year so this is actually a very
important news topic because it shapes
the way that technical coverage is
brought to the Internet
you all and it also shapes the way that
in this case intel develops its future
communications with media or with
consumers
so people that Intel hired recently
notably include Ryan shrout and his team
most of them like the entire core team
of PC perspective has left and gone to
Intel PC pretty still in operation with
a new editor-in-chief but Ken Allen and
Ryan are all now at Intel so that is a
very notable acquisition Intel has also
acquired talent from AMD's graphics team
including Roger Kaduri the former head
of Radeon of the RTG group that's
redundant and also Chris hook who is the
marketing lead at Andy for especially
RTG so big acquisitions now Kyle Bennett
is moving over there and Kyle's roles a
little different from the other ones
Kyle will be focusing as we understand
it on enthusiast relations and
enthusiasts sort of we'll call it
outreach I suppose for Intel so it
remains to be seen exactly what that
means but in general it sounds like from
Bennett's departing post at Hart osep
that this will be a job largely
relegated to communicating with the
online enthusiast user base so it could
be a good thing to bring a bit of
reality back to an otherwise massive
company where things kind of get lost in
the insane amount of management overhead
so as for what happens to Hardware CP
Bennett has a post on a hard o CP the
websites been in operation for about two
decades now it sounds like then it will
leave it sort of non functioning or not
updating but still functioning still
accessible just not updating not posting
any more reviews of technical products
due to the obvious conflicts of interest
and then a hard forum as we understand
it as being sold off to another company
that then it trusts and then all of
these properties will be demonetised so
they will exist solely based on I
believe patreon donations going forward
so Bennett then hopes to shift internal
paradigms at Intel and refocus on the
enthusiasts desktop user at the company
if you didn't know then it's probably
his most recent I guess legacy at this
point would
the GPP coverage the g-force partner
program that was largely done by hard
OCP so Kyle Bennett will now be moving
on from that type of work and toward
Intel
next news item DRAM prices are seeing
the steepest decline since 2011 good
news for our market place prices for
DRAM are on pace to drop about 30
percent this quarter alone even lower
than the previously projected 25 percent
drop so this would now be the steepest
decline in a single quarter since 2011
you may recall a time around 2016 2015
area where you can get at the time a lot
of memory 8 to 16 gigabytes for about 50
to 60 dollars and that time hasn't
existed back up until now according to
the report by DRAM exchange which is our
primary source for Mary prices very
accurate and shows often supply-side
prices - or at least some of them
vendors are currently sitting on roughly
six weeks worth of inventory and due to
demand suppression thanks to Intel CPU
shortages another topic for this show Oh
II am czar unable to sell through that
inventory access this has led to prices
entering a sort of free fall meaning
that the large price reductions are not
really going to translate to sales or
stimulate demand largely again because
of other shortages in the industry that
are outside of memory supplier control
next up the Radeon rx 560 XT this is a
card that I don't think it'll be up by
the time this news videos up but we have
a video coming up of touring the
Schengen s e-g market in China wherein I
communicated with market vendors and
tried to get access to this card before
it launched officially because well we
had seen some rumors online so we didn't
get one before we left China
unfortunately but this card isn't trying
to only launch and the 560 xt actually
is a bit better in terms of positioning
then and these previous rx 580 the one
that was actually literally an Rx 570
but called an rx 580 so you may recall
our coverage of the data land which is a
Tull product rx 580 in big quotes there
and our determination that it was again
a 570 this is a bit different it's not
quite as bad we're in that instance and
II took a product that had an existing
spec sheet renamed it to something else
and then sold it in an extremely
misleading fashion under a totally
different name with the same specs as a
lowered to your product wild calling it
a higher tier product that was bad this
is actually not that bad so the RX 560
has 16 C's recompute units and which is
a container for the SPS of the stream
processors the RX 570 has 32 si use and
the 560 xt which obviously sits between
the two has 28 si use so it is actually
an increase in the compute unit it is an
increase in stream processors obviously
because they're connected and so you end
up with a product that actually should
be a bit better than a 560 while not
being as good as a 570 but still
allowing a mid step price point and this
is targeting the China market or the
asia-pacific market and that's that's a
bit different market demand than in the
West so this may have a good sell
through rate over there we're not sure
yet we'll try and get one though
so anyway new card from AMD keep an eye
out for it it's called the 560 XT and
we'll see on the prices as it sees a
wider spread posting on retail sites in
tile record CPA shortages not expected
to get any better through the second
quarter of 2019 and this is related
loosely to that memory story as well so
Intel is affecting the whole market at
this point and that's a lot of pressure
to be Intel where if you do poorly
everybody else except the AMD does
poorly the motherboard vendors are
having the same issue where their sales
gigabyte and Asus especially and notably
are down as a result of down processor
sales from Intel despite a.m. these
climb so Intel's record shortages of 14
nanometer CPUs are well-documented we've
been documenting them for probably a
year now and according to industry
profits digit times those shortages look
like they may be compounded next quarter
and this is
just conjecture it's not just rumors
this is probably going to be accurate so
just in time for peak Chromebook season
and how it will be again at a bigger
deficit for 14 nanometer than previously
according to the report quote digit
times at research expects Intel CPUs
supply gaps to shrink to 2 to 3 percent
in the first quarter with core i3 taking
over core i5 as the series hit hardest
by the shortages and further in that
report which we encourage you to read
will link it in our show notes below
digit times noted that currently the
coffee-like core i5 cpus are the hardest
to get a hold of now fortunately for
desktop users this isn't a big deal
because the i5 s have largely been
usurped by the r5 s at this point but
there's still a large audience for that
and it's shrinking presently because
there's no supply so the supply
constraint will shift to the core i3
models especially in second quarter of
2019 as chromebook demand should be
kicking off bad timing there and tells
an inability to deliver on record demand
has led to AMD historically encroaching
on Intel's notebook market share with
Andes market share going from 9 point 8
percent in first quarter 2018 to fifteen
point eight percent in first quarter of
2019 year-over-year a significant
increase
additionally vendors are expected to
shift the first-ever based AMD based
Chromebooks next quarter leading Andy to
an anticipated 18 percent market share
in the second quarter of 2019 and we'll
have more news on the topic of market
share coming up this week we have some
sort of GN exclusive content we're
working on for you if you're curious
about that stuff make sure you subscribe
but Intel's expected to bring more 14
animated productions online soon Intel
has been shifting its product lines
around it has done some interesting and
sort of strategically I guess risky
moves of shifting some of its chipset
production back to older process nodes
like 22 nanometer and using those the
really low end modern chipsets so by the
second half of 2019 and I was expecting
to increase its production capacity by
25%
10:49 idea which would reverse some of
the shortage problems it has now and
Intel's also previously it out several
expansions at key sites we've talked
about multi-billion dollar investments
in Israel and in other sites like in
Oregon and Ireland so Intel's bringing
all of these fabrication plans up to
speed for 10 nanometre 14 animator or
whatever the future may hold
so Intel's 10 nanometer ice Lake is
scheduled to volume production in the
second half of 2019 but according to
those digit times reports there are
still several problems with the ten
nanometer process as such it looks like
Intel could delay that 10 nanometer
further we'll see where where it lands
originally we were expecting kind of
third quarter something in that range
end of summer third quarter for ten
nanometer but it's hard to say if that's
going to be hit at this point that was
our estimation in December back when we
were at the Intel event the architecture
day for 10 nanometer but things have
changed since then so we'll see what
happens 7:00 and we'd of course is up
for discussion as well despite all of
this though despite all of Intel's
production woes it's still on track to
read dethrone Samsung and retake the
crown as the world's top semiconductor
supplier for 2019 so in spite of all
that Intel's at least looking a little
better Intel previously held that title
from 93 until 2016 when Samsung famously
you served Intel as the world's leading
chip vendor at the peak of the memory
boom which has now waned and subsided
leaving Samsung with 20% lower sales
this year and giving into how the
ability to retake that title despite
Intel sales predicted to remain flat at
this point it looks like they will be
taking that title back new york has not
yet given Charter Communications the
boot so we've talked of this before as
well last year the New York government
historically ejected Charter
Communications which operates the
world's best internet service provider
spectrum that nobody hates at all and
they they moved to eject spectrum and
charter from the state and banned them
from further business
dealings marking an unprecedented move
against ISPs however to date New York
hasn't followed through on that promise
to boot charter and has allowed them to
remain operating so New York's approval
of charters merger with Time Warner
Cable was contingent on several factors
and factors that according to the state
of New York were never met this prompted
New York state officials to revoke their
merger approval ban charter
communications from the state and demand
a 60-day transition plan to be filed
although the plan hasn't been filed as
Charter Communications has been granted
several extensions while it renegotiates
with the state currently the state
Public Service Commission recently
granted charter another deadline
extension with a new deadline of May 3rd
2019 charters repeated extensions are
reportedly based on it working toward a
settlement with the state one that may
presumably allow them to remain
operating in New York according to the
New York PSC the most recent deadline
extension was granted based on a few
conditions quote Department staff had
previously advised that any final
settlement will include one an agreement
on eligible passings ie home and
business addresses that will count
toward the 145,000 passing build-out
conditions pursuant to the 2016 merger
order to a penalty and/or an arrangement
pursuant to which charter funds the
expansion of broadband access to further
customers in addition to those passed
pursuant to the build-out condition and
three and enforceable schedule to
complete the remaining build-out work
and there are several posts by the New
York Attorney General I believe or on
some New York official government legal
sites we've posted in the past an ARS
technica covered this most recently with
a full write-up if you're curious for
more on that or if you live in New York
and you want to know what's going on and
Vidia beats in town a bidding war for
Mellanox this is a bit older news but
we're in China when it happened so
recently both Nvidia and Intel
we're fighting to bid for the company
Mellanox which is an Israeli startup
focused on networking hardware using
Ethernet and in fin
and protocols for data centers and cloud
computing Intel had offered six billion
dollars but Nvidia asserted that it
could offer up to 10 percent more for
the purchase also and video was likely
more favored for the purchase as Intel
could potentially run afoul of
regulators Intel already has a sizable
share of the InfiniBand market through
its true scale fabric products and
that's part of the concern there
Nvidia eventually confirmed a six point
nine billion dollar acquisition of
Mellanox on Monday March 11th and both
companies subsequently issued statements
quote the emergence of AI and data
science as well as billions of
simultaneous computer users is fueling
skyrocketing demand on the world's data
centers and that was Jensen wan of
Nvidia the CEO who further stated that
addressing this demand will require
holistic architectures that connect to
vast numbers of fast computing nodes
over intelligent networking fabrics to
form a giant data center scale compute
engine you get the idea it's filled with
a lot of CEO words but you get the idea
so anyway it's a play at AI and data
science something that videos been doing
for a while now and looking at things
like high performance data center
computing looking forward to the future
of autonomous vehicles things like that
next up the Sun is setting on sky lake
as Intel announces end-of-life the
processors we're announced in 2015 they
included these 6700 K in 6600 K and are
now being put to rest
joining yo al status with a bunch of
other older Intel parts OEM and
retailers have until September 27th 2019
to place final orders the last chips
will ship March 6th 2020 won't really
affect anyone in our audience I I
honestly didn't know they were still
making any and we have one more story
here hackers exploiting the recent one
rar vulnerability you may have seen in
our previous hardware news episode that
there's a I don't know it was like 19
year old vulnerability and WinRAR that
could be exploited through a third-party
library that was patched out in the most
recent version of winter our but it's
being exploited now so as fate would
have it days after being disclosed by
the cyber research firm checkpoint
the attack vector began to be exploited
in WinRAR when Mars estimated 500
million users many of whom likely don't
know about the vulnerability or the
patch will now have an ideal tax service
for opportunistic hackers so McAfee
McAfee the one run by the crazy guy
previously has identified over quote 100
unique exploits and Counting with most
of the initial targets residing in the
United States at the time of writing
additionally 360 threat intelligence
center has documented several ways that
attackers are using the exploit to
spread malware and they've posted that
via Twitter so one such way that's
gained traction is through a
booby-trapped file named ariana grande
thank you next
20:19 320 are meant to entice though is
it looking at bootleg thank you next two
albums so it's it's imperative that if
you're a winrar user at this point you
update to version 5.7 you don't download
weird things that sound like viruses and
if you happen to be an ariana is that
even how you say your name grande fan
more of a metal person I don't know then
be careful of the album I maybe buy it
instead I don't know so that's it for
this one thank you for watching
subscribe for more as always you go to
store document access net to use that GM
shell code if you want to get 10% off of
the lightweight hoodie I'll see you all
