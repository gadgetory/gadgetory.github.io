gangrenous Nexus dotnet and today we
were talking about cube world an
action-rpg voxel based game that is
inspired by the likes of Zelda Diablo
and fantasy MMORPGs we first covered
cube world and Saturday heat signature
several months ago where we explored the
basics and discussed rumors this video
will cover everything major that we have
that we have access to so far it breaks
into sections of gameplay mechanics
combat mechanics and general concepts as
well as environmental what we know about
the environment and biomes so far so
these are all confirmed things by wall-e
himself the programmer and let's start
with an overview of the world cube world
is an infinitely generating voxel
landscape with effectively limitless
vertical and horizontal bounds the game
is being developed entirely by
programmer named by a programmer named
Wally excuse me who is looking to
achieve an action-rpg feel with a
fantasy focus and a focus on exploration
and traditional RPG elements like
questing leveling and group play cube
world will be multiplayer enabled and
according to Wally's Twitter is
currently aimed at supporting four to
five players at four to five let me
speak that clearly players in LAN or
online play he has suggested that there
will not be support for more than five
players currently as the games engine is
not designed to handle it and also he
doesn't think it would fit the the
tightness of the group that he wants to
convey the game has numerous landscapes
and environments including just about
every basic biome you can think of major
cities small towns faction strongholds
and kingdoms which include walled
country sides and end guards at the
gates dungeons caves and more are all
present in the game each environment is
littered with appropriate prefabs and
monsters dungeons have traps and
interactive elements like levers for
example mountains and mountain biomes
are perfect for a hang gliding and we'll
talk about that more later
cities have Inns shops towers and an
other types of buildings residences and
all of this all the cities and key world
are also randomized to an extent
just like the environments are the game
features handcrafted individual building
components but the engine then generates
buildings out of the pieces that Wally
has provided them so there is nothing
that is that is truly random but at the
same time nothing that is fully
human-made so so the cities will be
quite varied in that degree exploring
environments is similar in that regard
as you walk in the game you will uncover
more land and this will generate just
like in Minecraft use a modern example
there of course other games that
procedurally generate things as well
like Diablo does this with dungeons but
it is all done fairly randomly within a
set of parameters that is defined so as
to restrict it to a point where it
doesn't where it doesn't get all crazy
so further on the front of semi
customization players can take these
building components and place them to
construct their own structures but will
not experience the freedom of building
as demonstrated in again for a modern
example minecraft
however cube world wishes to retain its
focus on adventure and simplifies
building to a level that is fulfilling
to the player but not stealing the
spotlight so to speak there are multiple
city and building styles within the game
too so far Wally has mentioned a
medieval stone style structure north
american wood style european styles and
log structures temples dungeons camps
and fortresses comprise most of the non
friendly buildings each of which houses
enemy factions treasures traps and
obstacles proper dungeons will contain
portal stones which will allow players
to teleport back to the entrance of a
dungeon upon its completion thus
reducing the repetitive travel because
as we've discussed in game design videos
in the past it is not quite as
fulfilling to travel through an area
twice especially if you've cleared it
out in the first run and as a random
fact that is related to the caves and
dungeons while he mentioned that the
deepest cave he's encountered was 200
cubes below ground and that he enjoys
hang gliding through the cavernous
depths to explore a bit more quickly
different ores can be found deep
underground in these caves like iron and
gold which can then be used to work on
crafting weapons and items and crafting
is a huge part of cube world so far from
what we've been told the game contains a
lightweight voxel editor which allows
you to place different aesthetic
highlights on your weapons and armor
each of which adds a special effect
enchanting a weapon for example with
wind spirits will increase your speed
and attacks temporarily from the video
we were shown and while Wally has stated
that we can't directly create new
weapons we can modify existing ones to
an extent that they're entirely custom
or at least to the to the level of their
effects weapons that we know about so
far are pretty basic but include swords
maces axes great maces great swords
great axes shields unfortunately not
great shields not that that's even a
thing but I want it to be a thing that'd
be a thin lawn bows crossbows two-handed
katanas bombs stabs wands daggers
unarmed long swords did I say that
potentially shuriken x' and plenty more
unannounced options so quite a few
weapons there and hopefully even more
the shuriken Czar one thing that he has
mentioned a couple times and wants to
add especially for the ninja class that
we'll talk about in a bit
there are also spells of course but so
far I've only seen mention of a few
major types of spells like fire beams
fireballs and water based healing spells
that will go along with the two mage
class archetype so we'll talk about in a
moment this all contributes to the top
level character customization approach
of cube world we're given basic look
choices and and class and race choices
so you can customize your hair your face
stuff like that like I said basic look
and appearance choices and subclass
archetypes are also present to choose
from cube world aims to bring
customization to the player but not to
the point where it's overly complex and
confusing you won't be able to modify
individual stats like dexterity or
strength but you can choose a class and
subclass which will then level them
appropriately and you can also use
equipment to bolster important stats for
your build
reduces obsession with creating the
perfect character so to speak in power
gaming and allows us all to focus on the
actual fun of the game the equipment is
where where more customization comes in
if you'd like to create a very
particular build player characters can
also accumulate pets in a pet bag and
then equip them one at a time to play
currently if pets can be recruited by
feeding them their favorite food they
can also level and assist in combat just
like other players can and the pets that
we know about so far to name a few
include dogs cats moles Hornets crows
pigs penguins bunnies slimes and other
so-called and quote-unquote special mobs
that Wally has alluded to but has not
defined so speaking of mobs we know a
little bit about them so far following
the rest of cube world's random style
Wally has mentioned that enemy mobs will
be generated based around a specific
preset of requirements but they will
select from randoms bits and pieces so a
sari and turtle may have a large or
short snout for instance and different
body parts will generate different
abilities and advantages for those
bosses and mobs boss mobs will scale and
level based loosely on their location in
the world so the starting regions will
contain lower-level mobs but as you
separate from civilization they grow
impressively difficult submasters
possess the ability to destroy bits of
the environment so it's entirely
possible that you'll feel the
environment disintegrating around you
during epic battles they can take down
trees and mountains just with a couple
of swings of their giant axes or
whatever the they're holding over has
carried massive clubs that can stun a
player and and potentially be fatal of
course getting smashed by anything that
weighs a couple tons is probably pretty
fatal to most people so nothing knocking
the characters their battle will Evan
flow around a tight combat system where
subsequent attacks accumulate beneficial
effects like increased speed or bonus
damage character abilities are governed
by their primary archetype or class then
secondarily by a subclass Wally has been
fairly definitive with his four
available class and subclass options
which are currently listed as a warrior
with guardian or berserker subtypes
Guardians have increased health and
defense like tanks and berserkers have
increased attack speed with each
subsequent hit like barbarians and most
games Rangers have sniper or scout
subtypes
snipers have highly accurate ranged
attacks at very long range while Scouts
are more mobile and good and mid-range
environments spirit mages are your mage
user the fire mage and water mage are
two subtypes fire mages shoot fire bolts
fireballs fire beams all kinds of stuff
like that
to burn enemies to death and water mages
can heal allies with what Wally has
called water puddles or cast other
damaging spells rogues are the final
class that we know of they currently
consists of assassins and ninjas
assassins ambush enemies and use stealth
attacks to take them down and are more
active in that regard
ninjas are more reactive and are
specialized in evasion and
counter-attacks Wally has suggested that
he is interested in pursuing a paladin
class next though the current list seems
fairly set in stone so I don't know if I
have too high hopes about too many more
classes
he is also investigating a PvP or arena
combat system combat also requires user
controlled aiming as there is no longer
an auto lock-on system as shown in some
videos this is important for a lot of
reasons one of which is the damage
rating of normal attacks non ability
attacks are more powerful than in
previous iterations of the game but also
significantly easier to dodge this makes
stamina and spirit based spirit point
based attacks an important resource that
must be employed more strategically so
if you want to do normal attacks to fill
a time while you're regenerating your
spirit points that is great but they are
easier to dodge while he also mentioned
via Twitter that he hopes to add boats
and ships that we can already swim in
the game but he does want to add boats
at some point in the game further on the
environmental interaction front players
can carve out holes and caves create
bypasses and generally destroy voxels
with use of very Zelda like bombs these
can be placed in caverns and detonated
to link tunnel systems and and will not
be effective against non-organic voxels
that would affect the performance of the
game and the gameplay but they will work
on organic voxels like like environments
climbing cliffs is also a solid function
of the game that has been added and well
actually was added quite a while ago but
it allows players to feel secure in
their ability to explore deep mountains
and caverns and an escape of course
cleanly the game is shaping up to be the
epitome of adventure and exploration so
we can only hope that as things
progressed the community can show
patience and allow time for a proper
tested build to be promoted to the web

about cube worlds so far also in the
