metal is probably one of the most common
questions we get liquid metal is applied
between the CPU die and the IHS or
integrated heat spreader to improve
thermal conductivity from the silicon to
the heat spreader but there hasn't been
much long-term testing on liquid metal
endurance versus aid cracking and drying
are some of the most common concerns
from commenters leading users to wonder
whether liquid metal performance will
fall off a cliff at some point due to
age one of our test benches has been
running thermal endurance cycling tests
for the last year now since September of
2017 just to see if there's been any
aging that's impacted performance before
that this video is brought to you by us
and the gamers Nexus store at store
gamers Nexus net you can pick up one of
our mod mats now on backorder because
they keep selling out or you can grab
one of our other products like the
Raglan two-tone hoodie which we have in
stock or the full gamers Nexus logo
t-shirt that we just restocked in cotton
and tri-blend flirtin more at store
gamers Nexus net so this is a case study
of liquid metal and dealin and you've
all heard of deleting you've probably
seen our dewetting tests we tested the I
979 60 X about a year ago and deleted it
at the time using liquid metal to fill
the gaps one thing we didn't do is
remove the silicone adhesive around it
we found later that that improves
temperature a bit more but we left it
there as a guide and then let it run for
a year or so with liquid metal on it
using thermal grisly conduct or not
there are multiple different types of
liquid metal we didn't test all of them
that's one of the big things here again
it's a case study we are testing with a
sample size of one so we can draw some
conclusions from this but it is by no
means a sweeping result that you can
apply to all liquid metals on all
platforms ever so keep that in mind this
is an experiment that is overall
difficult to conduct and it's even
harder to do with lots of awesome with
enough platforms to build a significant
sample size I mean you'd need like 100
systems plugged in for a year doing that
and we don't have the capacity for that
so so we've got some long-term testing
on this bench next to me here and the
platform is using an Intel I 970 960 X
that's been overclocked to 4.6 gigahertz
it's running at one point to two volts
on a gigabyte gaming nine motherboard so
this is a 16 core CPU that's overclocked
and locked to four point six Q Hertz one
point to two volts as noted all of the
over current protections and other power
limitations have been disabled and the
79 60 X has been deleted and is using
thermal grisly conduct and not as it's
liquid metal with leftover silicone
adhesive still in place on the double
substrate we use the thermal grisly cryo
not for the thermal paste between the
IHS and our cooler but also did some
tests previously with some ACE attack
stock pastes we used the higher
conductivity pace here just to make sure
it's not a limitation or bottleneck in
testing we also use the G scale Triton C
black memory at thirty six hundred
megahertz across four channels which
does impact CPU thermals because the IMC
is inside of the die and the power
supply is an ax 1600 I in single rail
mode which is important because we're
pushing over 40 amps and some of our
testing which means that multi rail mode
would trigger
OCP and cause a shutdown so for testing
the system ran FFT workloads with
automated cycling for the past year
rather than thermally strain the CPU
24/7 we did cycling so this is something
that we learned a long time ago if you
want to simulate aged on any kind of
electronics or any kind of thermal
interface it's better to cycle between
hot and cool down or ambient temperature
than it is to just blast it 24/7 because
you put the component or the in this
case the Tim through expansion and
contraction periods which significantly
impacts how it ages as opposed to just
running constantly at a high heat you're
putting it through more cycles more
thermal cycles and that is more abusive
so that's what we did to simulate age
we're rapidly over the past year and in
addition to that we alternated loads
with break periods so it's more similar
to a real use case in that way and then
for final thermal results rather than
using FFT as we used blender because
it's been consistently reliable for a
load generation for this kind of testing
so we as blender for final results both
before and after the liquid metal aging
and then used F of T is for the thermal
cycling and between and the blender
workload is an in-house test we use for
CPU benchmarking so it's the same one
we've used for benchmarks elsewhere and
additionally initial testing was done
before the aging process and letting it
age so we did testing at the beginning
we did testing after with no changes at
all even the thermal paste remained the
same nothing changed we did more tests
after but changed the thermal paste
between the IHS and the cold plate of
the cooler and then we did tests with
new liquid metal which is where the
interest really is today and then all
these tests were conducted multiple
times for parody averaged and we dropped
some of the outlier results that will be
discussed at the conclusion there are a
couple of limitations of testing here so
we'll just put those out there to start
with for one we're only using one sample
it's not globally conclusive of all
liquid metals we only tested one the
most popular one and we also don't know
how this will change with different
components different dyes for example if
you are using a smaller dye versus
larger so it's limited in that regard
but we can draw some conclusions just
not hard all encompassing inclusions
that you might if you had a huge sample
size with lots of variation between
parts tested so it gives us a great
baseline for a case study and the liquid
metal it's not the only thing that ages
the thermal paste ages as well and
that's why we have tests before after
and test with new paste and old liquid
metal new paste a new liquid metal and
then also keep in mind that the cooler
although unlikely could have had some
aging itself it could have had some
permeation of liquid in the tubes that's
something we can't really account for
for in any meaningful way and that
should more or less cover it there are
lots of things that can change in a year
with a test platform that's undergoing
thermal aging so we did our best to
control but just keep that in mind it's
these are not results you should be
plastering all over the internet saying
that liquid metal never ages or always
ages it's results that you should say
here's a case study where they tested
one and they found these numbers so keep
all that in mind let's get into the
results for results we measured the
original application at 62 point nine
degrees Celsius delta T over ambient and
that's data from one year ago today
without changing anything we measured
their all performance as sixty three
point three
degrees Celsius over ambience and this
is well within our normal plus or minus
one degrees Celsius error margin for
testing and given that we have a whole
lot more variables with a one year gap
between tests then normally these
numbers are close enough that we can't
state any difference and again potential
for changes or error are introduced just
in the software testing as usual
introduced in the diode monitoring on a
CPU level introduced in the cooler the
pasted motherboard aging and a higher
chance of technician error because the
tests were conducted so far apart so
there was no significant change that we
could measure the change we are
observing is within error margins and if
it's not error it's more likely the
pasted aging than it is anything else
just from kind of drying and cracking a
bit so for that we applied new thermal
paste but kept the CPU socket it and
didn't touch the liquid metal
application with new paste applied and
the old liquid metal on there we
measured performance as just under 65
degrees over ambient again this is
within reasonable error we are also
using a different tube of cryo not this
year versus last year so that could
further factor into the results if the
batches were different with the new
liquid metal application we measured
performance at around 63 point five
degrees Celsius over ambient which is
within reasonable error of both our
original results and the new thermal
paste result so that's it it's basically
the same for this platform this testing
we were not able to find any meaningful
difference and we did control quite a
bit here as much as we could within
reason there are things that you could
learn potentially with a higher sample
size for sure but this gives us at least
a baseline to say with this specific
system the specific liquid metal
application that was done there was no
meaningful aging that we saw within the
one year time period now does that
change over two years we don't know and
unfortunately we won't be able to test
that because it was pulled the test at
one year so maybe we'll set something up
we had other liquid metal application
results that didn't make it into the
charts but I want to highlight them
because from our the one you saw the
final liquid metal application that was
done days ago as opposed to a year ago
that was our our third of three attempts
to apply liquid metal for the new test
just like the original data that you saw
was our third of three attempts to apply
liquid metal for
or the original one-year long test and
the reason for that and the reason for
bringing it up is that it's sometimes
tricky you can take a few tries to
really get liquid metal to work the way
you want you can get it to work pretty
damn well most of the time but if you're
really being a stickler about it then
the surface tension the amount of liquid
metal the specific way that you applied
the IHS the way the socket clamps and
potentially moves the IHS all of that
impacts performance sometimes more
significantly than others where you can
get a couple cores that are maybe ninety
degrees while all the others are in the
high 70s and so that's something that we
didn't like and specifically applied
liquid metal until they were all pretty
consistent and about where we wanted
them and considered to be the best
liquid metal application we could do but
again the point of this and the point of
detailing it is that the third of three
attempts for each the before and the
after looking metal testing result we're
taken and the other two weren't that
great and that means that there's more
variance more room for thermal
performance change when you initially
apply the liquid metal then there is
over a year of using it as far as this
system tells us anyway we can't draw a
firm conclusion there but as far as we
know from this testing there's far more
chance for poor performance from just a
bad application than there is from aging
and that means also that it's really
hard to measure differences because if
the difference is significantly greater
from the way the technician applies
liquid metal than it is from the end of
the other factors like aging it's it's
pretty difficult to tell the difference
in any kind of testing unless you have
some kind of automation to apply the
liquid metal so keep all that in mind
but overall there's your one year of
testing liquid metal on a bench pretty
controlled as noted we couldn't see any
meaningful difference it's with in all
variants and error margins that we allow
for so the conduct did not test we just
we didn't see much of a change cryo not
is another story we'll look at that
under the IHS next not sure if we'll do
it for it here or not there that might
be a bit extreme for just the thermal
paste as opposed to a liquid metal and
additionally if you've had your own
experience with liquid metal aging and
you had a different result than us
please let us know below because this
something we're having a greater sample
size will help and having some audience
participation be great for that so leave
your experience below whether you've
been running your liquid metal for a
year plus and have had no impact in a
negative way or if you've had negative
impact and then if you have other
specific liquid metals you'd like to see
us test there's stuff from cool labs
there's plenty of other stuff out there
too that's some of it's pretty old
actually if you have specific things you
want us to test leave a comment below
with what it is and we'll look into it
now that we have more space in the
office it's possible we could set
something up that's that's a bit more
intensive even than this one was so
