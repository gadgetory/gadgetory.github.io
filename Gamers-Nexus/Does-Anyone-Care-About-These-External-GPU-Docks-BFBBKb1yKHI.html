now at CES 2019 power color so we
visited last year and we saw the I
thought I was the devil box to the game
box they had a couple of these e GPU
enclosures and they're back this time
our biggest criticism then was that the
the airflow is really pretty rough so
good news power color has listened in a
significant fashion these are improved
in pretty much every way that we
requested about a year ago so good
development timeline there I wanted to
show them off and get some idea from the
audience as to what the interest is in
this type of product because we don't
cover them a whole lot but if there's a
lot of interest we can look into it
before that this video is brought to you
by the deep cool captain 240 pro AO
cooler the captain 240 Pro uses a
bladder within the water tank to expand
and contract based upon liquid
temperature as a leak prevention
mechanism this works by birthing air at
higher temperatures making for a unique
closed loop liquid cooler design the
captain 240 Pro also expands upon the
existing captain series by extending
tube length for more flexible
positioning and updating the LEDs learn
more at the link in the description
below so significant improvements let's
go through those last time the biggest
concern was was ventilation was fan
placement was internal power supply
placement stuff like that so this one
the mini pro smaller chassis fits
something like 1070 mini you can fit
like an RX 5 65 70 menu stuff like that
external power supply the chassis itself
it's steel it is running warm and if you
have anything that can be heat sinking
material you want it to be warm to the
touch because that means that it's
sinking heat so that's a good thing
perforation everywhere kind of the NZXT
chassis approach to perforating the hell
out of the case front of it's got two
USB three hooks up via thunderbolt and
then your throughput of something like
PCIe gen3
by four and that's a thunderbolt
limitation the power brick now is
external so previously we're looking at
these enclosures with an internal power
supply an ATX power supply that runs
just 12 volt or some of them run like 5
volt for smaller components things like
that but this is no internal power
supplies but smaller instead you get the
size back from an external power brick
it's 240 watts so you can put a video
card in up to that spec and then keep it
in mind that as we've discussed with
laptop
in the past it's really difficult to go
beyond 300 330 watts on these external
bricks so that's why you saw things like
the msi laptops running to power
supplies as input because for safety and
certification reasons they couldnt
really go beyond 330 so to forties about
the limit for an external supply but
yeah 199 for the enclosure no video card
inclusion included at that price and
then I think you have the rest of the
specs for that one so the next one is
the mini non pro it's more of a 560
model and this one the power supply is
180 watts and so you get a bit smaller
and in terms of the power capabilities
the video card but very portable and I
guess the use case for these things from
what I understand is primarily Mac users
so I wouldn't suspect a lot of you use
external GPU enclosures but if you do
please let us know because or if you
don't I'm curious to hear what the the
saturation of our market is for our
audience but I think Apple makes a bit
of sense because money and also not
particularly good a lot of the time for
the GPU side so yeah smaller one that's
really all there is to it there's this
is a prototype so this one there's still
room to change but I'll walk you through
what's here today and what's here's
bigger GPU support obviously you could
there's a fan master to the side to a
120 millimeter currently set up as
exhaust and then there should probably
be perforation we don't have a top panel
here today but I think it's specially
perforated on both sides at least one
so the GPU should be able to intake on
its own via fans on the video card
through the perforated holes and then
exhaust
I think the tops probably be enclosed
but we'll see if the fins are vertical
it will exhaust up and down but if you
have a fan in the back it doesn't matter
the pressure from the fans gonna
overcome pretty much everything else
anyway so it shouldn't really be any
heat buildup power supply ATX intakes
from the back again probably through
perforated holes on the or perforation
on the side panel of the case and then
that'll exhaust out the back towards me
where the i/o is for the video card so
this is not finished the current ATX
power supply on here is not finished
that will change but I think the idea is
targeting more of the high end user
which is probably what more of you would
be if you're buying something like this
something comparable for example to the
razor core or to double box previously
game box stuff like that
so that covers the the power color sweet
couple questions for you as viewers do
you care about any of this stuff if you
do why if you don't why and I guess
hearing the prices so like $200 stand
alone and this one comes with a video
card so kind of hard to give a price on
that stand alone because don't have one
yet but what would you pay for something
like a steel small enclosure like these
with maybe a couple USB ports or what do
you think is reasonable to pay given
that it costs money to make things so
