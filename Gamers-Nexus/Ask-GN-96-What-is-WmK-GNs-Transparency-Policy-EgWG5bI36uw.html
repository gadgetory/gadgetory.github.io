episode this is the third one of three
I've shot today
it's getting real lights about 3 a.m.
and after this I have to edit the rest
of the David Cancer interview how to
make some changes to the day 4 vlog go
to sleep wake up in a couple hours and
move this thing into the new office so I
just went over all that in the patreon
episode on patreon.com slash gamers and
axes if you want some behind the scenes
info it will be in there we had audio
issues and that one hopefully they're
not too bad but anyway there's a lot
going on right now
and it's hard to keep up with so this
has Jana's always post your questions in
the comment section below if you have
them we'll try and get them next time
this is likely the last sgn I will be
shooting in this location we'll pick up
the series in the new location shortly
after this and may have already done so
by the time this one goes alive so let's
get into it before that this video is
brought to you by the Corsair strafe RGB
mark to mechanical gaming keyboard the
strafe mark 2 uses Cherry MX which is
available in MX red and MX silent and
uses the elevated key cap design that
has become part of course there's
keyboard identity elevated key caps make
the keyboard much easier to clean with a
blast of compressed air and limit dirt
build up the keyboard use a metal body
design of have received praise from us
in the past in old reviews for high
build quality learn more about the
Corsair strafe mark 2 at the link in the
description below
first of all quick housekeeping stuff
thank you very much to all the
programmers last episode I was answering
a question about optimization I gave
some of my thoughts on like GP and CPU
optimization and then I asked any
programs in the audience I know there
are a lot of you out there to please
count with your own experience below and
you did and man there's some really
insightful stuff there I learned a lot
from it and I hope others did too so
thank you very much for sharing we
should basically start at elegy on
series 2 that some of you have joked
about so that I can learn from you all
who are experts in various fields anyway
thank you for doing that
and also quick note stored at Karen's
Nexus done that still has a lot of stock
finally of the GN tear down crystals
where we have it's a really sweet like
3d logo with really high resolution
print in it of the GN logo except torn
down with various PCB components on it
like MOSFETs inductors fans stuff like
that so if
look at it kind of closely you'll see
all that detail so that's on store deck
here in Texas net let's get into it
first one the crimson pinch says are
there any plans to restock oh well
there's a store question any plans to
restock the GM pint glass they were gone
before I could get some yes we have a
lot on the way demand was really high
super happy to see it sold out in like
16 hours or something so we have more on
the way they will be here within a week
of this going live if not already in so
thank you for asking though we we like
them a lot and we'll have more first
real question then Steve Strazza says
what does watts per meter Kelvin mean to
a consumer is it directly correlated to
performance for a given Tim ug a higher
number it means better thermals is it
something that casual overclockers
should concern themselves with or is it
mostly for the benefit of extreme
overclockers the term has come up
several times and talking about various
Tim's and it would be useful to know how
we as consumers should be using that
information this is a pretty good one to
start the episode off with I think it's
a great question
so like anything first off measuring the
thermal conductivity Watts from your
Calvin it's not universally accepted how
that's done between the different OEMs
and manufacturers and thermal pacemakers
so just like anything else measuring fan
DB stuff like that you might have some
variants and how they do it so numbers
aren't necessarily directly comparable
between each other although there are
absolute standardized methods to take
throwing conductivity measurements
doesn't mean everyone does it that way
so there's no like overarching
governmental standards saying you have
to do it this way for thermal paste so
that's the first note second note
strictly speaking know it is not always
directly correlated to perform so here's
the thing if you have a perfectly
controlled environment which never
happens with a computer if you have like
absolute perfect conditions there's a
straight theory in straight theory yes
something with a higher specific thermal
conductivity then its competitor will
outperform said competitor all else
being equal so when I say all else being
equal this can this contains things like
viscosity of the paste contains things
like the curing time of the pace how
long does it take this
to cure and harden and that can affect
its performance either positively or
negatively depending on how it's
designed this includes the literal
compounds within the compound is it
silver diamond ceramic whatever and and
stuff like that so we're we're assuming
a lot of things are identical and if you
assume everything's basically identical
the only difference is the thermal
conductivity specifically don't account
conductivity then yes the one with the
higher number will be better but that's
not how it works in the world of
computers so in the world of computers
and we've tested this so some of this we
actually we haven't published it maybe
one day but so we've done testing on
thermal paste I've done some some
testing for individuals who had specific
questions about how they perform and I
found in some actually a lot of
scenarios something like a 5 watt per
meter Kelvin paste will perform the same
as a 12 watt per meter Kelvin paste it's
not the same either one's better or
worse but we're ignoring everything like
curing time and how well does the age
and how easy is it to spread and stuff
like that I'm is speaking a lot because
I'm really tired and 3:00 a.m. and we're
moving an entire studio sorry so all of
that notwithstanding like I said we've
tested four or five white community
Kelvin pastes the same in performance as
the higher ones and the reason for that
is because computers are really complex
there are a lot of variables there's a
really good chance that unless you're
pushing a lot of watts through the CPU
that is and maybe you're deleted or
soldered and you have a good interface
and a good cooler and good cooling and
air flow and everything unless you have
all that stuff including the high
wattage going through the CPU you might
not actually realize a difference in
performance I mean it's it's one of the
last things you can change in the line
of cooling to try to improve performance
because you kind of do the obvious thing
first you get a big cooler and then you
get a CPU that makes sense thermally get
a case with good airflow and maybe you
deal in maybe put liquid metal all of
these things you would do first before
just only buy and hire and paste and I
don't mean like literally because buying
higher-end pays is so easy that
it might be a first thing you'd try for
a lot of people so it's just it's it's
there are a lot of other things that can
sort of bottleneck the performance and
you'll see the same performance and so
then it's all kind of irrelevant other
than things like curing time and aging
so certain pace age a hell of a lot
better than others you might notice that
and I think someone asked about this in
one of the episodes might notice that
video cards if you've had it for a few
years you take it apart you put new
thrown paste on it it's an easy way to
immediately improve the thermal
performance by a couple degrees in the
least under the same thermal test
conditions and that's because the paste
ages and hardens and cracks and gets
useless so curing an aging is a huge
consideration but we're not talking
about that are we're talking about the
thermal conductivity so other notes here
that I took on this other than all the
various all the variables I had a note
from vsg who these days does a lot of
work for techpowerup but also has his
own site thermal bench and is a thermal
dynamics expert we'll call him so VSG
noted you know we should actually define
what does watts per meter Kelvin really
mean and it is thermal conductivity but
what does that mean so his note to me
was was this I was asking him what's the
best way for me to illustrate this and
he was saying the M as in watts per
meter Kelvin for define all the letters
the M is a single length dimension that
comes from a / L service area and
thickness thermal conductance is
basically the amount of heat in watts
passing through a given time on a
material of 1 meter squared area through
one meter of thickness that has two
sides l offset and temperature from each
other by 1k so breaking that down their
own conductivity important part here
thermal conductivity is conductance
times L over a where L over a are going
to be thickness and service area in that
order and also note that K in this case
is delta T and that the watts part here
so heat is measured in just joules for
energy but to express it for this
equation
expressing it as a rate of change of
heat in watts by keeping track of the
time so once you go from joules to watts
by taking a time element and tracking
that so over a period of time we're from
joules to watts so watt spoon your
Kelvin is is more or less defined as
that if you want to visualize it
hopefully that helps you out so going
back to the core to the heart of your
question though
and thank you VSU for the answer going
back to the heart of your question of is
it directly related to thermal reforms
for given Tim yes except in the world of
a million variables in a computer at
which point you're gonna run into so
many other things first that you might
not even realize again or you might have
a huge gain it just depends so for
example last example given before moving
on I noted that there are times we've
seen same performance 12 + 5 watts per
meter Kelvin pace the opposite also
happens you can do pace directly under
the diet of of a CP or sorry directly
under the IHS on top of the die of a CPU
and see bigger differences there then
you might see with pasted on top of the
IHS with a lidded cpu with limited
cooling capabilities or something like
that cuz just gonna run into so many
other problems and things you can
improve first also margin of error is
huge for that kind of testing because
you have things like human error and
application of the pay's - so anyway a
lot of things to consider with testing
pastes just watts per meter Kelvin
doesn't make it better just like just
horsepower on a car doesn't make it
better or just watts on a power supply
doesn't make it better there are a lot
of other factors to consider and the
biggest one is how well does it age and
does it harden over time so some pastes
are better built for that than others
next one Brom says when asking go okay
that's just a joke on a more serious
note Brom said regarding the office can
you share some plans previews of how you
want to decorate the sets are you gonna
go all stylish like LTT all humblebrag
like a.j or something else
you've mentioned the tables and the tool
wall and in previous video you mentioned
Adam stab
his workshop and he plans to try
building something like that to build
something like Adam Savage's workshop I
think you need to be in the business for
like decades and have millions of
dollars in a lot of space I do really
like his workshop it's cluttered as hell
but it's organized chaos and he seems to
know where everything is and it suits
his style perfectly I'm not trying to at
me like that I admire it and find it
very interesting and fun to look at
everything he has and think it's a great
set but so first thing we're gonna do is
move this stuff all over so we will at
least be starting with the same set
except this shelf is going to be a
functional shelf elsewhere in the office
so I don't think this shelf will be in
the shot we might have something it's
place I don't know I don't know if we're
gonna be shooting out this like kind of
45 degree angle anymore I really like it
it's different it's interesting but we
have a space to shoot straight against a
wall now which means we can have some
depth to the shot so I can have cool
stuff on a table behind me and a table
in front of me maybe with cool stuff on
it to a wall livestreaming station with
an amazing 8 foot table plus a sick
husky workbench behind it so we have a
lot of options decorating I am sticking
to the sort of industrial look that we
have and I really like it I find I find
that function makes a lot of sense I
like that the sets are places I can work
and do things that I would do when the
cameras are off and and I think that
looks great because it's so natural that
is just everything makes sense like if I
put tools on the wall that I actually
use and I know where they are it feels
like it's not like a it's not a being a
poser it's something we actually work
with daily and I find that more
relatable when you're viewing the video
that like oh these guys actually use
that stuff and I don't know it's not
just a prop so that's my approach we are
getting some wall art and stuff like
that for around the office I don't know
how much will be in the sets I ordered
some silicon wafers that are really cool
so we have silicon wafers coming in from
old AMD parts I don't even I couldn't
tell you what they are to be honest they
weren't listed on there but old AMD
parts old Texas Instruments pard stuff
like that
so that'll be cool wall art and probably
a couple posters I was kind of playing
with the idea
like vintage posters that might be kind
of funny today like advertisements for
hard drives that are 1 megabyte or
something like that I thought that'd be
kind of interesting but I don't know if
it'll be in the sets or not it might
just be kind of a cool thing to walk
into when you come into the office so
yeah I don't know it's more or less
gonna be the same to start same wall
color and everything and then we'll
expand it if you have ideas of like I
don't run wall art to have physical like
Hardware pieces that might be
interesting in the background let me
know but we are keeping a functional
look to start with I consider projecting
our logo onto the wall and then tracing
it with paint like I mean just like the
not this logo but the tear down logo
that's on the mod match considered
projecting out to the wall and painting
over it you know then turn the projector
off obviously and we have a cool logo
painting on the wall but I don't know
that I have the patience for it I think
it'd be difficult and I'm not
particularly trained in that so I don't
think we'll do that but anyway some
stuff I thought about next one Swift so
it's silver said if I passively cool my
whole PC CPU GPU power supply will it
heat up my room anywhere at all only
insofar as reducing your cooling
efficiency might have some more power
leakage and it's so minimal that it's
nothing to consider so this is actually
a really interesting question and I
think it's kind of hard to initially
wrap your head around this concept and
I'm sure most of you already know the
answers to this but so let's start with
power leakage you if you cool a CPU less
efficiently for every 10 degrees
difference there's roughly 4 percent
power leakage so yes technically your
room will get hotter but you're almost
definitely not going to notice you're
talking like potentially single-digit
watts depending on the power of the seat
of the component that you're cooling so
let's just let's just say no let's just
say the answer to the question is
functionally no any increase you will
not notice but this is a bigger topic of
cooling I mean I remember years and
years ago before we started doing any
kind of testing before I was really
doing this I remember learning that
cooling your CPU better didn't make
room cooler or didn't reduce the amount
of heat coming out of the PC beyond the
power leakage and I just thought that
was the coolest thing because really any
heating or cooling system all it's meant
to do is move the heat around to get it
the hell away from the silicon
components they can operate efficiently
and out of the case and into whatever
the environment is room or out the
window or whatever so yeah if it's not
going like the Seabee running cooler
doesn't mean that the room will be cool
or it's producing the same amount of
heat again ignoring leakage producing
the same amount of heat using the same
amount of power and all that's happening
is you're getting that heat away from
the CPU faster and more efficiently and
so the CPU can run cooler and the heat
still getting dumped into the room and
that's all there is to it you're moving
heat around that's all any kind of
cooling system is basically ever you're
you can't destroy the thermal energy you
can't destroy the heat so it's going
somewhere and that's going to be into
your room but yeah the the difference is
again it's gonna be about four percent
on every 10 degrees on the CPU alone so
you're potentially single-digit Watts
maybe double digits with a really high
on CPU it's pushing a lot of power so
now real difference we did test by the
way it was one of our least feud videos
from last year sadly because it was a
really cool one it was about like impact
of I don't know multiple GPUs on room
temperature or something like that and
it was interesting so I set up like a
mining rig for a couple days and we do a
test turn it off let the entire room
cool down for a few days whatever and
test again and what I did was keep
adding GPUs and it wasn't the most
scientific test in the world but it was
a test of how much heat gets put out
into the room via power consumption and
at what point does that affect the like
the human comfort level in the room when
do you start actually getting room
temperature increases and we did some
tests where we got like nearly runaway
scenarios with a thousand 1500 watts I
can't remember I think I want to say I
want to say it was like a thousand watts
or something was one of the worst ones
we did with 5gp as I think and after
just a couple hours of that
they see on and with the room all closed
it was something like 10 degrees warmer
which is just really interesting I think
personally it's it's not 100% really it
is your question but it's an offshoot
that is interesting it might be worth
watching that one when it was only like
2 GP is so the heart of the test for
that one was how does a you know we
people always talk about 10 70s in Vega
56 back then anyway and talk about how
well the 1070 draws less power so my
room will be cooler we saw a lot of that
on reddit and elsewhere and I was like
okay but I want to test that is that
true is there any validity to 50 watts
difference making that much of a
difference in your room temperature the
answer is basically no so that was a fun
test but anyway that's completely on
sort of underneath it's your question
might be something you guys find
interesting though next one Savage said
should you replace the thermal paste on
graphics cards that are a few years old
even if they're high-end models also
would the thrown pads be reusable or
with new ones of similar thickness need
to be purchased there are all pads first
you should always replace they're all
pads on your GPUs with same thickness
than all that if you must replace them
use the same thickness pad if you use it
a let's say it's like let's say it's a
one millimeter pad originally and you
put
1.5 on there because that's all you have
around you can start creating Boeing and
the PCB when you remount the cooler
because it'll it'll apply pressure it
was not designed to apply in the area
where that pad is and you can have
things like if it's got HBM it's pretty
easy to mess up the HBM I don't know if
it's like if it's a cracking within it
within the inner poseur or if it's like
traces are getting messed up or cracked
or whatever's happening I'm not positive
what precisely happens but I've done it
personally where if you put a pad and
that's too big and you clamp it down and
it's too much pressure in one spot
that's got HBM especially you can start
getting video artifacting that's
unsolvable because there's now a
physical hardware defect from Boeing of
the PCB so it's it's something we've
done and I would advise against it you
want to replace the pads with the same
size
pads if you do my if you do have to
replace them and replace them showing
really do if they're so torn up after
tearing it down the card that is that
the pads are so torn up that they're not
really reusable or if they have a bunch
of dust on them that happens a lot if
they feel hardened if they don't if they
don't produce grease anymore they're
supposed to when when they get hot then
those are all valid reasons to replace
them or if they just suck let's get one
two they don't paste should you replace
the oil paste that are a feat on cards a
few years old I don't know if he should
it depends on how good the cool the card
and the cooler were originally just do
your do some kind of test and decide if
you didn't have log data before that
kind of sucks because then you can't
make a perfect comparison but do a test
ad hoc test decide if you're happy with
it or not and if you're having other
thermals and who cares leave it alone
there's no reason to take it apart
unless you really want to and if you're
not having other thermals give it a shot
because there's a good chance yes it
will improve so should you the answer is
no you well the answer is you don't have
to should you depends on if you like
doing that kind of thing I would because
it's fun and it's not difficult and if
you've never taken a part of video card
it's it's so easy it's a couple screws
the hardest thing you could do is use
the wrong tools which I did on this
channel years ago when I started taking
apart cards so I get it but you know
just use the right tools and it's pretty
easy and it's fun high-end models yes
high-end models are plenty capable of
using cheap their own pace we've seen it
next question is from medalists who says
your opinion about corrosion from liquid
metal on a copper heatsink I'm getting
the new throttle put pro nicely done I
want to squeeze out every bit of
performance I can get but I have many
things I've read many things about
corrosion on copper heat sinks I don't
want to damage the expensive thing first
of all for a laptop you don't have to
use a liquid metal like if it's any kind
of direct I cooling really liquid metal
is not necessary at all you can just use
like a high-end thermal paste that has a
long lifetime like it doesn't age very
much it's
not conductive that's a big thing
something like cryo not I'll note they
are an active advertiser with us but it
is something I would genuinely use hence
asking them to be an advertiser or not
someone else so cryo not or an
equivalent page from a competitor would
be good for that just avoid stuff that
is electrically conductive things that
have silver in them avoid things that
have any kind of like metal in them and
it'll be fine to use like it's not gonna
hurt anything because you're not gonna
short anything
liquid metal really comes into play when
you're bridging the die to an IHS to a
cooler because then you have a lot of
thermal interfaces and it's going
through more layers of stuff which means
it's less efficient at transferring so
it can really use the help your direct
dye you're already so close to the to
the CPU with the cooling element that
you should just use thermal paste in
most cases so liquid metal might help
let's say you you know what you're like
I but I want the best and I'm willing to
do it and it's not a big deal so okay if
you're willing to do it corrosion that
is the question kuroh damaging metal
with liquid metal is certainly going to
have and if you apply it to aluminum
let's skip that all the way first if you
put liquid metal like gallium indium
conductor not mixture or something like
that on aluminum it will eat away at the
aluminum there will be damaged and you
won't like it and it won't be good so
don't do that if you put on copper I'll
remind you an IHS is copper its nickel
plated so the nickel plating on the IHS
helps keep the the worst you get is some
visual just visual artifacts like has a
visual deformity where with an IHS
that's nickel plated you wipe the liquid
metal off it comes off 80% of the way
you have some just gray left behind it's
not a big deal doesn't impact on all
performance really but it's off behind
and I could see how that would concern
people but there's no pitting or
anything like that if you start putting
it on copper so we did this with the
rocky cool I don't see it because we're
moving but there are cool IHS the just
basically pure copper one the exposed
copper one I should say with no nickel
plating you put on copper it will stain
it
it shouldn't typically
I don't I haven't tested every liquid
metal but for conduct and I you
shouldn't get physical damage with like
pitting and corrosion and stuff like
that you will get staining for sure but
you can wash most of it off with acetone
you'll still have a silver stain there
basically forever once you apply it it's
not gonna hurt the whole performance in
any meaningful way we've we've looked at
that in our own testing never published
it because didn't really see a need to
then do it for publication we just did
it to see if that was something we
needed to be worried about when we were
doing controlled thermal tests and
things like that so no I I would use
something like cryo not or whatever's
equivalent from competitor non
conductive and good and doesn't doesn't
crack too soon but if you usually could
metal you know it'll it'll stay in it
but it's not going to corrode it just
keep it off of the aluminum and keep it
away from anything you can't short or
arc to more tin to Stith says I have a
few questions about power efficiency and
CPUs would it be more efficient to run a
CPU at a higher percentage load at a
lower clock or at a lower percentage
load at a higher clock for example
there's a two gigahertz CPU running at
one hundred percent load use less power
than the same CPU at four gigahertz
under 50 percent load assuming this
hands high workload we're assuming a
whole lot of things here more than just
workload but it's fun questions so let's
do that so for power efficiency with
CPUs we have a great content piece on
rise in 2000 series where we did a volt
frequency curve and the efficiency of
that curve so we basically Patrick
Latham did a lot of this work he's on my
team and plotted the voltage requirement
to sustain a given frequency and then
what is the minimum voltage required to
maintain those frequencies as we
continue to overclock the the chip and
what we found was that it's more or less
an exponential curve but it kind of if
you plotted it out it kind of goes like
this and eventually just gets so steep
and voltage requirement voltage on this
axis frequency on this axis eventually
the voltage requirement gets so steep
that you can no longer increase the
frequency without something like
- or exotic cooling and their Bower did
his own version of this test with Alan
Zoo and found also an exponential curve
but with a much higher frequency than we
were doing but it applied pretty much
universally so getting back to your
question then power efficiency always
goes out the window when you start
overclocking so especially if you're
overclocking by like a gigahertz plus so
if you if you're overclocking it
requires exponentially more power to
keep or Veeck or I should say to a
voltage to keep pushing the frequency
and you lose a lot of your efficiency
there it's it's never going to be well I
shouldn't say that in most cases let me
give you a real example just just to
cover my cover my answer here because
I'm not gonna say it's never gonna be
more efficient or less whatever because
there could be a CPU out there where it
is more efficient to do that but let's
just take like an ad 86 KR u 7r okay if
you take that from 4.7 gigahertz stock
with max boost and push it to 5.1 I
can't really think of a scenario where
the the performance gain from
overclocking is going to outweigh the
efficiency loss from overclocking it
that doesn't mean it's not worth
overclocking it doesn't mean it's not
worth getting the task done faster it
might well be but it's not going to be
more power efficient if you take that
specific processor in that scenario and
do it because the power require the
voltage requirements it's so extreme
once you start pushing those higher
clocks that efficiency goes out the
window so yeah you're talking about on a
let's say a thirty to forty minute
render test which we've done for
overclock into max potential clock often
it's on an order of magnitude of like 10
percent improvements at best in a lot of
cases some CPUs are more extreme but
that's kind of what you're looking at
whereas power consumption could easily
be 2x so hopefully that answers your
question pretty well it doesn't mean you
shouldn't do it just means that you
don't do it because you think you'll be
saving energy and 7 trekkie last one I
just saw that you show your patreon
revenue publicly how many creators do
this and I
you for it do you think this level of
transparency will go away in the future
as you grow this is something I've
thought about a lot the answer is if
people abuse it then yes so we've we've
had some things we used to publish a lot
more information about what we do and
how we operate and stuff like that and
people in community abused it and tried
to use it to attack us without actually
validating whether what they were saying
made any sense an example would be when
we were doing 30-second test runs for a
lot of the games rebenchmarking and the
whole AMD community piled on us
basically saying that all of our testing
was invalid regarding the Rison launch
because the 1,800 X was completely
unimpressive for my price to performance
standpoint all even though I said the
1,700 was an amazing CPU but that's
that's the community so the thing is I
didn't publish it until a year later for
competitive reasons but a year later we
started the what was it called bench
theory series and in that video and
article series I showed that with our
testing with the games we test the
30-second tests produced the same
results as testing for a minute or five
minutes or longer and that's because you
know believe it or not we actually do
look into these things we don't just
pick a number and go so it actually was
validated before we ever started doing
the tests but the community in that
instance was looking for something to
bludgeon us with and we published a lot
of our testing methodology because we
believed in that transparency and people
use it to attack us without anyone
checking to see whether they knew what
the hell they were talking about turns
out they didn't because I was able to
prove that the methodology was
completely valid and I already knew that
but we just we didn't publish that data
till a year later for competitive
reasons because we didn't want to
publish it until we changed everything
in our testing methods which are now
different than they were then but I
haven't published that either again for
competitive reasons and once we revise
that method we'll publish the previous
year's or current year's methods in this
case so that's an instance where
providing more information although
probably a net good in the
the area of test methodology and
something that I do want to do it can
bite you and it and not even in ways
that are justified so that yes
transparency goes away as people abuse
the transparency and there are
competitive things to consider there's
stuff we don't publish their stuff that
we don't share for how we test because
we don't want competition to do the same
thing and catch on and you know it gives
us an edge lets us do what we do and be
unique and do our own thing and create
our own market and all this stuff so
there's always going to be stuff that we
don't share like software that we've
built for console testing for example we
do console benchmarks now we're not
going to publish that and give it away
because we spent years figuring it out
like in terms of just like building the
experience to build the software I'm not
saying this the software didn't take
years but the experience did so we don't
just share all that stuff but I am
slowly starting to add more and more to
the methodology sections back in even
after getting burned for it before
because I do think it's the right thing
to do I do like the idea that if
something's wrong people can in the
community can validate and help us
figure it out so that we can correct the
information if there needs to be a
correction even though it's it's really
extremely rare but the fear of course is
that when you're asleep or on the other
side of the world or whatever you can
adjust the problem someone's going to
take that information and run to the
outrage culture machine on the internet
and create this big story out of nothing
and bludgeon you with it so it's a
balance between do I want to share
because the right thing to do well
there's three things to balance if you
could have a scale with three things on
it a triangle scale I guess you have
competitive concerns you have community
concerns and then you have doing the
right things and concerns and it can't
just all be doing the right thing
because then you lose all your
competitive advantage and you
potentially expose yourself to get
attacked in ways that actually aren't
based in reality or anything else like
there's difference between getting
criticized for doing something
incorrectly or maybe being able to
improve
something and getting shamed and
attacked publicly for something they're
not doing wrong so you got to balance
all those things in it I'm constantly
learning how to do it better and we're
trying to get back to sharing more of
the methodology because I do like
sharing that and I think it's very
interesting for people who don't test
Hardware all day to know what goes into
it so yeah the all of that from your
question of patreon revenue publicly I
like mostly I'm not gonna like post our
revenue information or how much people
get paid or anything like that because
it's not anyone's business but I will I
am happy to show the patreon revenue
publicly because it is a
community-funded platform and I think if
the community is giving that money then
the community has a right to know how
much money they're giving us so that
when they see us doing all the stuff
we're doing there's a really clear link
where you're like oh I'm helping pay for
that I'm helping pay for them to do fan
testing I'm helping them pay for them to
hire people and hope you pay for them
it's get an office where they have
actually have space not bump into each
other physically so I that I think makes
the most sense to keep open and
transparent as long as people don't
abuse that transparency that's kind of
all I'm gonna really look really looking
for so anyway also come with money and
knowing how much someone gets is that
what you don't know is how much we spend
so there's something - talked about
before where sharing information like
patreon revenue publicly if you're
someone like what's Jim sterling or
someone who makes $12,000 a month on it
we don't know his expenses his profit
could be pretty low or it can be really
high so people will see that number of
12,000 a month for someone like Jim
sterling and thank holy crap that guy's
loaded but I don't know what his case is
but in our case there are a hell of a
lot of expenses so there is a bit of a
danger where people will see a number
where at something like I don't even
remember to be honest I think right like
5,000 public revenue on patreon right
now per month and it looks really good
and it's very helpful but you have to
remember that you know I I'm spending
multiples of that on things like moving
payroll
inventory travel all that stuff monthly
so anyway yeah that's it for this one I
want to start moving this over at at the
David Cantor interview thank you for
