900 high-end flagship now offering a
revision to that for the record
largely offers changes we didn't ask for
still apparently a lot of people wanted
a power supply shroud and some wanted
faster fans for this largely silence
focused case today we're back with the
dark bass pro 900 revision 2 to see how
its performance and build have changed
since the first revision the new
revision is $20 more expensive than the
original DBP 900 but we'd expect price
will eventually fall closer to the
original $250 price point of the dark
bass pro 900 case that we reviewed last
year before that this video is brought
to you by the EVGA CLC 280 liquid cooler
people ask me how I keep cool during the
summer with all this hair well I've
tried a lot of different products and
few do exactly what I need many of them
cause tangles or worse EVGA CLC 280
helps keep my core temperatures low
they're in hot benchmarking sessions the
CLC 280 is price competitive and focuses
on performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
this is the dark base Pro 900 rev 2 if
you remember the original we actually
liked the case overall the dark base pro
900 had excellent build quality it has
interesting features not all of them are
useful like the Qi charger for instance
a lot of people probably don't care
about that but if you wanted it it was
in the top front of the case still is so
it has some interesting features it does
things differently it's terribly
expensive at $250 but the price wasn't
all that unfair for the original dark
base pro 900 it's just it's high not
unfair but it's high the case overall
has always built itself as primarily a
silent focused case the name of the
company is be quiet
X my exclamation point so the name
pretty much explains what they're going
for with all their cases given that nice
exclamation point at the end of the
sentence so with the be quiet dark base
pro 900 the primary change that we're
interested in the one we're testing is
the fan speed change they've gone up
from a thousand rpm to 1600 rpm quite a
significant change in our PM but because
the front panel is still ultimately
pretty closed off
it's hard to say how much that'll matter
because you can put the fastest fans in
the world in there if they don't have
access to a lot of air and they're
fighting to pull air in through the
sides you're ultimately relying on
static pressure the power of the fan
when most of it's blocked off and
ultimately you will be bottlenecked by
that front panel but the question is one
of a greater discussion on fan RPMs
versus attempting to silence a case it's
not thing we've discussed before where
they're kind of two ways to achieve
silence you either open the whole thing
up which of course exposes it to dust as
well another fault of the arguments you
can open the whole thing up
and run lower rpm fans that's gonna be
pretty damn quiet because they're
running in slower speeds or you close it
all off and around higher rpm fans and
try and fight the enclosure to bring air
in and either way can work it just kind
of design depends on the design how well
it's been done
be quiet designed the dark Bass Pro 900
exceptionally well the foam padding used
first of all giant sheet of tempered
glass is great for dealing with the low
frequency noises low hums and things
that noise that fans often make the
padding on some of the paneling in the
case helps with the higher frequency
noise it's like coil wine because the
idea is that tiny the sound wave is
going to hit the foam break into some
pieces bounce around a whole bunch and
hopefully not really much of it will
escape and get to the end user so they
always did well with that but now we're
looking at the changes one of the other
big changes we'll talk about here is the
power supply shroud the major difference
in this revision is the addition of a
PSU shroud someone asked for this it
wasn't us the only mention of a power
supply shroud in our original review was
to point out that there was enough room
for cables elsewhere so it was actually
unnecessary to even have a power supply
shroud the shroud must be removed in
order to install the power supply and
the process of replacing it is annoying
enough that it's easier just to leave it
out
however it's optional to install it can
be purchased separately to add to the
revision one cases if you wanted and
it's understandable that be quiet wants
to offer as many features as possible in
their flagship case that said power
supplies roads always pose a bit of a
problem potentially for airflow this
case is mass
enough that it might not matter as much
we'll see in the thermal section but we
never asked for the PSU shroud as noted
there's so much space in the backside
that you really almost just don't even
need it and you probably have a modular
power supply anyway if you're spending
almost $300 on the case
so not something we cared about but
either way it's not harmful to offer
more options so there's that let's talk
about the LED and the fan controller the
functionality here is basically the same
as revision one but there are also
performance - silent toggles like the
controller and the DB 700 it now
supports up to 8 fans rather than four
LEDs are 12 volts now and can be
connected and synched with other
standard 4 pin strips and can be
controlled via a button on the front
panel formerly the reset button fans the
fans are still 140 millimeter silent
winds threes but they're sixteen hundred
rpms rather than 1,000 that has
implications as noted for both thermals
and noise which will look at momentarily
hard drive bay has changed a bit to the
original dark bass pro 900 had nine
available ports for seven free-floating
hard drive baits while the revision 2
has 5 ports for 3 Bay's the lower two
ports the upper two since this case is
invertible have been converted to fit a
2 drive hard drive cage instead so that
the power supply shroud will fit as well
and to summarize that's up to three
single slot hard drive bays above the
shroud and 1/2 slot hard drive cage
underneath the shroud USB is changed as
with the dark bass 700 be quiet has
filled one of their USB 2.0 ports with
USB 3.1 instead type C and the other USB
2.0 port has been replaced with a USB
quick charge plug panel attachments also
a bit different the thumb screws that
hold on the glass panel have a weird not
quite flathead not quite Phillips cross
on them and they thread on two posts
rather than screwing into holes so not
technically screws I'm kind of are but
the front panel now has two
spring-loaded magnet attached turns one
at the top one at the bottom rather than
just one and the screws you can just use
fingers if you want or if you do want a
screwdriver flat head or Phillips both
work some owners of the original dark
base pro 900 wanted these upgrades
obviously and if you want to buy them
separately from be quiet you can so
that's an upside from the be quiet
design document they said the following
the new power saw
crowd and hard drive slot covers will be
available for customers using the first
dark Bass Pro 900 version the windowed
side panel and additional hard drive
cages will be offered separately as well
alright let's get into the thermal
testing here this one's kind of
interesting so the primary comparison
for this case will be revision one we
have plenty of other cases on the chart
but we're gonna focus on the dark base
Pro 900 revision 1 because we already
focused the revision 1 versus everything
house and it was ok overall for what it
is
so revision 2 has faster fans it's got a
fan control that works a little bit
differently and the results between the
two cases should be different but the
amount of improvement seen for example
opening the front panel would
approximately be the same so check your
check our previous review to see
temperature deltas from other scenarios
like opening the front panel or taping
off the mesh trim shot on the front this
mesh right here in the front the only
mesh on the front we taped that closed
in the original test and just for fun
and we have that in the original dark
base Pro 900 review well kind of cover
it briefly here but check the previous
coverage basically for more of that and
also check the previous coverage for
overall build thoughts or thoughts on
installation ease of installation build
features all that stuff we talked about
there absolutely no point going over it
again because the inside of the case
other than the stuff I've already
mentioned it's all the same so if you
want to know what we think of the case
build quality stuff like that just watch
the first review and we're gonna focus
on thermal today for revision 2 we
focused on testing with the fan
controller we plugged the case fans into
the motherboard and configure them to
100% speed for baseline stock testing
and then for additional tests we tried a
few things one setting the controller to
performance mode and the slider to
maximum because it is a slider and
another one was performance mode and
slider its minimum silent mode of
sliders maximum silent mode with slider
to minimum and so forth so the fan speed
slider in the front panel is stepless so
maximum and minimum settings are pretty
easy to replicate and that's what we
used we're starting with only the dark
base pro 900 then we'll move on to
comparative numbers this includes the
old model for the dark base pro 900
revision 2 CPU temperature was 56
degrees Celsius over a min during the
torture test and 55 degrees Celsius with
the fans plugged it into the controller
inside the performance mode then maxed
out judging by the tempered
since we can't log rpm using a
controller it seems like the controller
really does allow the fans of speed up
at the full new speed and for revision
two of the nine hundred results using
the controller from best to worst were
as follows
performance mode with maximum speed was
best silent mode with maximum speed
performance mode with minimum speed and
in silent mode with minimum speed even
just in performance mode going from
minimum to maximum brought CPU DT to
sixty three point nine degrees over
ambient versus fifty-five silent mode
minimum rpm was by far the hottest test
and the only reason it didn't go higher
than seventy one point seven degrees is
that the CPU is hitting 100 C and
throttling hard that's because seventy
one point seven is over ambient and it's
also averaged so we were actually
hitting a hundred in the middle of the
test when it's the most torturous this
mode would only be advisable for lower
TDP systems with low load levels ie for
browsing or desktop use compared to the
old 900 stock 4 stock temperatures are
improved from fifty eight point six
degrees to 56 degrees not a huge change
and our other tests were specific
conditions like removing the front panel
entirely and inverting the layout
comparatively with other cases the
original stock DBP 900 reached fifty
eight point six degrees Celsius over
ambient towards the warm end of our
scale with its higher fan speeds the
revision to blazes more toward the
middle alongside the define R six and s
340 Elite Four how closed off the front
panel is that's okay the DPP at 900 is
overall unimpressive for cooling but it
is also targeted more to the noise
sensitive audience and makes no claims
to be a top-class cooler the changes be
quiet made are not significant enough to
upset the charts particularly because
the front panel is so blocked off that
the higher-speed fans aren't able to get
enough access to air to improve coin in
any substantial way this is a matter of
diminishing returns and starts boosting
noise levels beyond what might be worth
to begin with cooling is okay but not
impressive for just the DVP 900 GPU
torture test GPU dt average forty seven
point six degrees celsius during the
torture test with fir mark and almost
exactly the same using the controller at
max speed and performance mode the best
to worst order of performance is the
same as the cpu temperatures performance
and max is the best silence and max
performance and minimum silence and
minimum
and you get the idea the range of
temperatures was smaller however and
even the silent and minimum average CT
was only fifty six point five degrees
over ambient moving on to comparative
GPU data we were surprised how well the
revision two provided GPU cooling
especially since it added a power supply
shroud to the case that could
potentially restrict airflow anyway a
small part of this could be that we
intentionally flipped the power supply
over when reviewing the original because
of restrictive ventilation on the bottom
of the case which may have caused the
power supply to compete with the GPU for
air more importantly there's the higher
rpm fans and the lack of pre-installed
hard drive bays to block the airflow
path from the front of the case whatever
the reasons the revision to has some of
the coolest GPU temperatures we've
logged it recently well below the
originals average of 54 point nine
degrees Celsius and a lot of that is
just because of how hugely open the
front of the case is so even though the
fans are blocked all of the air is going
straight to the GPU whatever the error
is that the fans can bring in it's not
obstructed by anything that's going into
the GPU the power supply shroud isn't
designed in such a way that it doesn't
eat too much of the performance and also
the case is so gigantic that the power
supply shroud to video card distance is
great enough that it's not really
interfering much with the GPU coolers
ability to exhaust air so that's why
we're seeing the results we are next up
3d mark GP temperatures were slightly
higher in 3d mark stress testing that in
the torture test averaging forty eight
point eight degrees Celsius over ambient
that's even farther below the original
DBP 902 average of fifty seven point
five CDT and impressively below most of
the other cases on our chart as well GPA
coolant is genuinely good in revision to
something we wouldn't necessarily expect
from a noise damage case but one that is
a result of that higher rpm fan and just
how damn large the case is rendering on
the CPU with blender CPU DT was 38 point
four degrees in the blender test that's
fairly average and below but within
margin of error of the original DBP 900
when utilizing the GPU gbzt there in the
render was 24 c beaten by both the PMO
one and half X but cooler than
everything else noise levels are next
even with all of be quiet annoys dampen
running fans at 1600 rpm reached forty
three point two to forty two point four
DBA as loud as the DB 700 was dark bass
700 at max speed or the Silverstone RL
zero six the quietest level we achieved
using the
32.4 DBA only slightly above the n1 303
with no fans in it but keep in mind that
the cooling is so bad that you really
wouldn't want to use this setting for
any kind of performance the main
advantage of having silent and
performance toggles on the fan
controller is that there are two
channels so two different groups of case
fans can be set to two different speeds
while being controlled by a single input
the way we used it with both controllers
flipped the same way it should just be
set to performance mode that's because
silent and minimum was that effectively
the same noise level as performance in
minimum about 33 DBA for performance and
minimum scored better in most thermal
testing and fan rpm can be maxed out in
performance mode which is a huge bonus
so again this becomes a greater
discussion on do you go the noisier fan
route with a more open case or do you do
something more stifled and go a slower
fans or faster fans to try and overcome
them which is what be quieted so they
stuck with the original silent paneling
focus stuck faster fans in it and the
result is that the case is actually
really freaking loud when the fans are
maxed out it's towards the worst end of
the chart for noise if you consider
noise bad but you can control it pretty
easily it's got a fan controller there
are two different sets of toggles you
can do so if noise is a problem for you
but you're okay with it when you're
gaming maybe you have headphones on or
something like that then it's not bad
it's just that the case does a weird
thing where performance is good actually
overall yes but they're mixing both
silence and performance in weird ways
that ends up with either you have kind
of mostly okay performance and good GPU
performance when maxed out but not great
noise performance or you have fantastic
acoustic performance with not great
thermal performance and it's gonna be up
to you to set it the way that makes the
most sense it's just it's one of those
things where it's not really set it and
forget it unless you're okay with noise
or you're okay with awful thermals it's
maybe you can set it in the middle and
it'll tend to be towards the loud around
but it does deviate from the original
silence focus of the case and that's
different different for be quiet it's
not a bad thing necessarily it's just
that the case is trying to do two
different things simultaneously when it
can really only do
one at any given time and it's up to the
user to figure out which one that is so
just keep that in mind in performance
the revision two has much better GPU
cooling results than revision Wanda
that's because revision 2 has faster
fans and the layout is still huge 140
millimeter silent winds fans sell for
$20 a piece or more on new eggs so
upgrading an original DBP 900 to match
revenues performance is an expensive
proposition and cooling performance is
the single best argument for purchasing
the newer one versus the older one but
only if it applies when fans are running
above a thousand rpm if you're planning
keeping them there or lower then don't
bother basically revision 2 is a better
performing case with a few more features
than its predecessor which we already
liked it's just altogether is it worth
$20 more and making the power supply
installation even more annoying than it
is to get the revision 2 and we still
like rev 1 for what it does watch the
original review for that it's definitely
not for everyone but it's really damn
good when it is for you when it does fit
your use case revision one's a good case
and it's 20 bucks cheaper so this one's
not bad it's just if you were basically
if you're dying for the power supply
shroud sure 20 bucks is worth it or if
you wanted the faster fans but you don't
want to buy your own seperately or don't
already have some that I guess maybe
it's worth it because the value
proposition is there for the better fans
so that's it for this one very high in
flagship case we know not a ton of
people buy cases in this price class but
hopefully for those of you considering
it you've got a decent review now to
refer to and as always go to store our
cameron's nexus dotnet to pick up some
of our merch we have this shirt it's a
limited edition shirt once they're gone
