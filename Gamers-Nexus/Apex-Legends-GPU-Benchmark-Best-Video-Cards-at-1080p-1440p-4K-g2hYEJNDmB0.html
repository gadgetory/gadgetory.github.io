in controversy about not being Titan vol
3 but that's been apparently resolved
because it's now one of the most played
games on the market and is often top two
if not the most played or most viewed
anyway on twitch TV so today we're
looking at apex legends for GPU
performance we're testing a wide range
of video cards and we'll be looking at
performance study in different areas of
the games a testing practice mode versus
multiplayer mode different areas of
multiplayer mode and then ultimately
determining what's the best test path
for GPU benchmarking this gets fairly
involved because apex Legends is a
higher fidelity first-person shooter
game with a high player count with a
really big map long view distances and
geometric complexity that can impact
cards heavily so let's get into the
testing today to look at video card
performance and how they all stack up
against each other before that this
video is brought to you by the coarser
1i 140 compact gaming PC the corsair 1i
140 is a small form-factor PC outfitted
with a 9700 K RT x 28 e 32 gigabytes of
RAM and a 480 gigabyte nvme SSD all
housed within a 2 millimeter thick
aluminum chassis the corsair 1i 140 is a
12 liter system fit for desktop use with
the same sized I 160 counterpart with
higher-end parts learn more at the link
in the description below
apex legends is a battle royale game if
you hadn't heard it's also sort of
titanfall in that it's using the same
universe and a lot of the same assets or
similar ones the same engine even but
it's not literally titanfall there
aren't Titans falling from the sky
instead its players it's more of a pilot
fall it's also not titanfall proper it's
not the same sort of wall running
mechanics and things like that so if
you're familiar with titanfall this is
different this is one of the more
annoying titles test because origin for
some reason still has a 5 hardware
change limit to testing the game so if
you change your video card five times in
the amount of time allotted it will
restrict you from playing the game any
further even though it's a free-to-play
game so we end up just making a lot of
accounts sorry EA but let's get into the
performance testing and and we'll start
off with sort of the study this is what
we do when we try to figure out how we
should even test the game before
committing to a full benchmark pass the
most important thing to do before
embarking on testing
dozens of configurations is to establish
some level of reproducible results
within the game multiplayer is clearly
where everyone is playing but the map is
huge
it has desert regions it has grassy and
mountainous regions it has a river with
semi flooded buildings that are very
graphically intensive and there's the
initial drop in from the sky with a
fuller view of everything framerate is
all over the place in this game if
you're properly playing it which is what
makes it functionally impossible to
benchmark with full accuracy to absolute
numbers just watching through clips in
our video that you're probably seeing
now you can see how varied the
environments are and the best we can do
is establish a reliable benchmark that
gives accuracy relative to performance
scaling between cards so let's start
with a study of 4k performance to see
consistency from match to match well
look at frame time plots after we get
through the frame rates graphs that
we're looking at next the 1080 TI and 4k
settings at high had us observing an
average FPS of 47 when dropping into the
match with a framerate primarily driven
downward when looking over the landscape
at a glancing angle but wider views of
the landscape and horizon drove FPS down
to about 47 FPS average for five minutes
in the hills and the burned forests we
monitored framerate at about 60 FPS
average with lows at 45 fps 1% and 39
fps 0.1%
we have some footage of that as well but
this area isn't really that demanding
it's much less demanding than the river
area that is later is elsewhere in the
game so this was just coincidentally 60
FPS average vsync was off adaptive sync
was disabled finally testing with
practice mode instead of multiplayer we
see that our framerate shoots high we're
at 73 FPS average instead of 47 to 60
FPS for the range sort of within reason
but it's clearly not realistic this is a
20% performance gap and even ignoring
that there's still a question of whether
other cards would scale accurately in
practice mode the answer has you'll see
later when we prove it with some numbers
is no they do not scale linearly between
practice and multiplayer and so we
ultimately abandoned practice mode and
instead went for multiplayer testing
with multiplayer as long as testing is
conducted in exactly the same spot every
time this
fashion it's accurate from run to run in
games game we tested this to the testing
only deviates and becomes variable when
testing in random locations and
multiplayer at 1080p the initial drops
plot between 126 fps and 137 FPS average
with that difference primarily emerging
from whether we look straight down or
with a wider viewing angle of the
horizon our two 5-minute test passes it
covered the entire map plotting between
162 FPS average and 182 FPS average with
a low is functionally equal between each
in this specific game there's a lot of
range and what that single what the map
shows because it's one map for
everything as opposed to something like
black ops where you might have multiple
maps that are more easily controlled
practice mode also poses a problem
though with even our heavier load
practice testing landing at 206 FPS
average this ranks it as 13% ahead of
the fastest gameplay test not
unreasonable really or 27% ahead of the
slower test which is unreasonable for
these reasons we're going with
multiplayer testing in a controlled area
with heavy load using the river region
of the map this will give us data that
best represents the real gameplay
experience but remains controllable for
variables and is reproducible in testing
so this gives you both the absolute and
relative scaling with only a few caveats
in between that we'll discuss later
finally getting into the results here's
1080p with multiplayer testing near the
river part of the map where we see
medium to heavy load without introducing
one-off load inducers like grenades more
on that after these charts further note
that we disabled the framerate limit
completely so we're not limited to the
144 FPS cap that is natively in the game
the 28 ETI ends I've had about 161 FPS
average with the Radeon seven card
shockingly close at 153 FPS average we
didn't trust these numbers looking at
them they didn't really match any of our
other scaling between the 2080 TI and
Radeon 7 so we reran both devices again
then reran with a different 2080 TI a
third time just to be safe at the end
the numbers repeated the Radeon seven
card falls off hard as resolution
increases something will show you
momentarily and it's curiously counter
to what one might expect with its memory
bandwidth but also something that we
showed as possible in our Radeon 7
review this game does seem to run well
on Radeon 7 at 1080 P when compared to
the 2080 ti we
might you would think be bumping into
some sort of frame limit on the CPU at
1080p but our peak FPS numbers during
this test do post at 242 to 60 fps and
above so those spikes won't be shaved
too short if at all there may be some
heavy draw call regions that are more
CPU intensive but on average we are
reasonably distant from the FPS
bottleneck or at least concerns of it so
we can just say that Radeon seven scenes
to do well here
the 20/80 trio ends up at 145 FPS
average allowing the 28 ETI a lead of
11% with the Radeon 7 by a couple of
percentage points the 1080 Ti is further
behind the 20/80 than it has been in
other titles ended up at 128 FPS average
to 145 FPS average of the 2080 producing
a gap of 13% favoring the 2080 and
allowing the 1080i to match the 2070 in
performance for this title it seems that
an rx 580 with a light overclock ie and
rx 590 it's the same thing or NRT X 2060
would be good modern-day options for
purchasing for the mid-range - upper
mid-range price categories the 980ti if
you have one still holds on well ranking
at 80 FBS average with 1080p high
settings and the 970 seems to do alright
remember that settings can be dropped
below what we're running to further
improve performance we're at high so
you've got a couple of ticks there if
you do need to up take it a bit the fury
x ends up with frame time consistency
issues pretty serious ones as does the
rx 570 where both have low frame rates
dropping
below the mean distance against the
average that we see in other tests 1440p
has the 20 atti at about 124 FPS average
so we see uplift of about 62% over the
average FPS of our upcoming 4k numbers
that we haven't shown yet the low
performance is still consistent and good
on the 28 ETI
with frame times on average within a few
milliseconds of each other
the 28 ETI runs 12.7% ahead of the RT x
2080 which runs 3.4% ahead of the Radeon
7 card so we've now flipped in the
performance rankings between these two
and this is about within the performance
range that we observed to the radio I'm
7 and our initial review as for the rest
the 2060 seems to be a line of division
against the lower end of the chart
offering a good upgrade pathway for
those wanting to play apex legends at
1440 key with high settings 82 FPS
average with lows around 60 is widely
acceptable performance for most people
if you want more we do have other cards
on the chart interestingly we see big
performance hits on the fury acts again
in the RX 570 where we think for the
fury acts the limited vram might be
causing some of that massive hit the
frame time consistency dropping Louis
222 FPS your own percent in 36 F he has
one percent so arms 5 to 70 experiences
similar behavior here the GTX 970
curiously does not seem to encounter the
same issue so less of an issue on this
one we believe that it's so constrained
elsewhere in the pipeline on the 970
that memory is perhaps not coming into
play in quite the same way as it is for
the more powerful fury X the card the
970 is having trouble enough running at
even 30 FPS average 1440 view high so it
may come down to architecture it may
come down to driver optimization for the
game but either way it's not playable
with these settings
so moving on 4k at 4k high the 2080 ti
ends up at 76 FPS average ranked about
16% ahead of the RT x 2080 trio and 34%
the head of the Radeon 7 the 2080 ends
up at 16% ahead of the Radeon 7 card
which is functionally tied with the 1080
Ti interestingly in this game we
actually do see the 2080 placing
reasonably above the 1080 TI in our
launched a steam the 2080 was closer to
parity with a 1080 CI in just about
every game and sometimes falling a bit
behind here the 2080 weeds the 1080 Ti
and speaking of parity there the RT X
2070 isn't far behind the 1080i in this
testing with a 1080 TI posting a lead of
just 3.4 percent this matches what we
saw in the practice tests as well that
we haven't shown yet although we
consider those tests largely invalid for
wider performance analytics due to
scaling limitations and limitations of
issues shown like with the fury X versus
multiplayer still interesting but not
particularly useful if you want to get
an absolute idea of how performance is
the r-tx 2070 leads to 2060 by about 20%
and at this point we'd probably
recommend the 2060 dropped to much lower
settings or to 1440p the 2070 does okay
but in a fast-paced game like Apex
Legends it probably also benefit from a
slight settings reduction they give it
these six struggles to keep pace here
although it's frame time consistency and
performance is good in this title
overall so for that it gets praised the
r9 fury x ends up behind vega 56 with
low is dropping
off to inconsistency potentially a
results of those four gigabyte
limitations especially at 4k the fury X
also ends up roughly tied with the aging
and once Kane 980ti
which is just 8% ahead of the XFX rx 590
clearly these cards are not really meant
for 4k gaming but some of them could be
made to play apex legends at nearing
60fps with enough graphics quality
reductions it'd probably be better to
just play at 1440 though if you wanted
to and if you were close enough like in
the 50s you can drop down to medium
settings instead of high and be within
reasonable territory all of these
numbers we just showed are pretty
accurate for multiplayer use on average
so you can use these as an absolute
measure of performance this will of
course become less true if patches
launch of the game is optimised if
performance is fixed on the developer
side in any way or if drivers changings
but for now they can be used for both
absolute and relative performance
scaling numbers and they can be used as
relative performance scaling numbers as
the game gets patches this becomes a bit
less true in the absolute most load
intensive scenarios we can find but for
the vast majority of the multiplayer
experience the numbers are good as a
representation of performance one
example of where our numbers would no
longer be reliable as an absolute metric
would be if involved in very heavy
combat where multiple grenades are going
off particularly the incendiary grenades
as an example those incendiary grenades
that we tested in practice mode where
you have an infinite amount of them by
the way would drop framerate by roughly
23 percent when detonating several in
sequence like three of them in a row
that's a big performance hit and it
isn't accounted for in our charts so
keep that in mind for decision making if
you want to make sure that things hit a
specific FPS target always in all
scenarios including multiple incendiary
grenades and close proximity factoring
another 20% drop to FPS in those severe
scenarios to be fair this isn't that
common and it requires a lot of
inventory of those grenades multiple
people and a lot of combat but it can
absolutely happen so it's an important
factor to know about finally here's what
a practice mode test would look like
let's first firmly know that this is
sort of invalid data will mark the chart
clearly that way - since people will
otherwise just jump to this point pasted
everywhere without listening and
assuming it's accurate this data is only
valid to practice mode but it is valid
to practice me
it does not scale well to multiplayer
when looking at relative performance
card to card one good example would be
the fury X in multiplayer we ran into
frame time consistency issues as a
result of memory limitations but those
limitations did not emerge in the much
more limited practice mode this is a
huge difference in play experience even
ignoring the higher average FPS the
actual frame to frame delivery is
significantly different and that's
because in practice mode we're not doing
with this massive map lots of objects
lots of high resolution textures players
impact it somewhat but really it's the
enormity of the map that really impacts
the amount of VRAM utilized and how the
card is leveraged elsewhere like in the
geometry pipeline for example so the
next difference is in the 28 ETI where
we see nearly 300 fps and practice but
about half of that and multiplayer at
1080p even if scaling were perfect card
to card which it isn't really there is
still a point at which it's just so far
from reality that the numbers are no
longer really that useful this scaling
is way off the Radeon 7 for example ends
up nowhere close to where it should land
the 2080 ti does uncharacteristically
well versus some of the other Nvidia
cards like the 28 or the 1080i the fury
X isn't a suffering like it should be
and so forth some numbers like the 580
versus the 1060 are actually pretty
representative of relative performance
in reality so it might be useful there
but ultimately this is still somewhat
flawed and it's hard to know exactly
which cards do and don't perform as you
would expect versus multiplayer so we're
just going forward only going to use
multiplayer testing and our multiplayer
test path in the river region as the
practice mode is simply not
representative enough or load intensive
enough for play and cards with different
advantages or disadvantages like memory
memory bandwidth in the geometry
pipeline for example those just aren't
leveraged in a way that is intensive
enough in practice mode so we hope that
apex legends introduces a replay mode
for easier testing and assuming it is
accurate to play sometimes they aren't
and that would make things a lot easier
but for now we'll just do it manually in
multiplayer mode and practice mode just
know that it's kind of okay in some
really close scenarios like 1060 and 580
but overall probably shouldn't be using
this for benchmarking
there's your apex legends performance we
didn't go too low and the skew list of
video cards didn't really hit the bottom
end there but it's fair to say that this
this game plays reasonably well on just
about everything we tested at we used
1080p some of the devices obviously
start to fall off at 1440 you lose a
whole lot of them at 4k this is normal
but at 1080p with high settings
everything we tested for the most part
can play it reasonably well and if you
did want to use something lower and then
we test maybe a 1050 Ti maybe an rx 560
you could still try and do that lower VT
Ram capacities do impact performance but
you just drop the texture quality so
really try and alleviate some of that
memory strain and then further of course
you could drop to medium or low settings
although it starts to suck at that point
so everything we test though the the
scaling we're pretty confident in with
multiplayer benchmarks practice mode we
really wanted it to work because it
would be the the easiest to do with the
greatest sort of reproducibility of the
benchmark to avoid any potential
variables introduced by multiplayer
however after we did run a bunch of
practice mode tests and a bunch of
multiplayer tests multiplayer is clearly
as you've seen the most accurate
depiction it is the most reliable for
card to card scaling so practice mode
although you would think and we did
think this that scaling card to card
would be probably pretty linear between
practice and multiplayer it ended up not
being the case and that's just because
of how much bigger that map is when
you're playing and multiplayer so
ultimately we did go with multiplayer
mode for permanent testing in the future
and just keep that in mind but the game
itself is it's reasonably good-looking
without being all that load intensive so
they're doing some good object calling
in there where even though it's a
massive map once you actually land in
the relevant area you're calling
everything of course that's not in the
view frustum so the performance is not
that bad once you kind of drop in and
get into the map so that's it for this
