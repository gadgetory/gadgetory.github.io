Nexus net and we just got back from a
facility tour of Corsairs local offices
in Fremont California we checked this
out on the tail end of our GTC trip the
GPU technology conference so the first
item of note is a new logo this is
something that many of you will notice
this is on the outside of the building
we saw it when we were walking in for
our tour and it's got more sharp angled
edges than the previous sales logo it is
not the scimitars logo that you've seen
on the gaming forged product this is a
new version of the long-standing sales
logo and it is an attempt to sort of
modernize the design so that's the logo
on the inside of the building is the
cool stuff though and we've done a few
tours like this in the past with NVIDIA
for their very expensive silicon failure
analysis lab and you can see some of
that here we've also toured Kingston and
they're SMT lines or surface mount
technology I by powers assembly lines
and so forth Corsairs test engineering
labs are not too different in some of
the equipment that is present than these
other ones but their implementations may
be a little bit different based on test
methodology Corsairs engineering lab
that we toured has a couple of thermal
chambers which are effectively very
large ovens that are used for components
stress testing and that's what these big
blue things are they can put components
in there and test them thermally under
very high stress high heat conditions to
check for failure points and then try to
improve upon those points before product
shipment adjacent to the ovens was a
Croma test bench and chroma is a
high-end manufacturer of electrical test
equipment electrical testing can be
deployed for internal components of
course but also competitive analysis
which is something that we see quite
frequently at large manufacturers when
they're trying to determine if they can
somehow improve their product by looking
at a competitor in the same test
engineering lab is a wind tunnel that
has a suck less vengeance sticker on it
and a cycle as screen saver for that
matter and this is used for case
fantastic so it's like any other wind
tunnel for the most part just small and
they
put a fan in there they can control the
flow rate of the air they can check the
CFM of the fan the RPM they can control
voltages and all those types of things
very useful for testing case fans and
determining their efficacy another
nearby lab is a little more
straightforward to those of us who are
system builders it's got a couple of
open-air tech benches or test stations
and those are used for testing CLC's and
memory and things like that that Corsair
manufacturers of course the cool thing
about one of these tech stations is
actually got an arm sticking out of it
to support the CLC so it can hold it in
the air which is something I haven't
seen before it I just thought was kind
of worth mentioning I wrote about this
in the article links in the description
below a manufacturer could use this arm
to control the orientation of a liquid
cooling radiator if they thought it
somehow impacted their test results
which is certainly possible if it's
oriented vertically or horizontally
there was also a light box nearby that
had a couple of variations of popular
Corsair cases in different colors so
there were orange green red yellow cases
and these were made one quarter was
experimenting trying to determine if
they wanted to venture into various
colors of these cases the lightbox is
used to test how the color reacts under
different lighting conditions so that is
the conclusion of our corsair facility
tour you can check out links in the
description below for more information
on this tour and some links to the
previous tours we've done our thanks to
Corsair for inviting us into their
offices and allowing us to show some of
this content to you guys we hope that
it's entertaining and interesting check
the channel for more information on this
and I will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
