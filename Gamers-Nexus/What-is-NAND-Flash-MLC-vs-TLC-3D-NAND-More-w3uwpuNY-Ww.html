of their marketing language with
different initialisms like MLC TLC
v-nand 3d v-nand and other sorts of NAND
and that's what we're talking about
today this is sort of a special edition
feature or analysis where we're just
strictly going to define what nand is
the different types and how they impact
you nand and the nand type used in SSDs
ties directly into price performance
endurance or longevity as it is often
known and understanding what nand is and
how different functions on the
controller work to further endurance or
performance that's important to buying
an SSD that makes sense for your needs
and important to considering the budget
restrictions that you might have versus
the wants in terms of performance and
endurance let's start with an animation
that we made for this video this
animation highlights a few of the SSDs
core components including electrical
components like transistors memory
components like flash and the driving
controller and this as we cut to a
simplified SSD image contains a few
basic parts there are eight flash
modules a controller and eight channels
to connect the modules to the controller
the controller is effectively the SSDs
CPU equivalent and handles all of the
transactional processing and we're
leveling and garbage collection to
ensure that the memory has a lawn
service life and when I say memory I do
mean flash memory in this instance for
sake of example let's talk about a
specific type of NAND so one of those
might be 16 nanometer flash nand that is
of the mlc variety so we'll dive into
each of those things mlc means
multi-level cell something we'll dive
deep with momentarily and NAND flash is
the specific type of memory NAND flash
is a non-volatile permanent memory sort
of an opposite of system Ram which is
temporary and volatile and unlike a hard
drive everything is sort of transacted
at the electron level and without
mechanical parts whatsoever then
and prefix na nd indicates the type of
logic gate used for the flash these
gates control the flow of electricity
two components has a dam would do for
water and if we cut to another simple
SSD image here you can see digging a bit
deeper that each flash module could
contain multiple flash dyes in this case
our imaginary SSD saturates all eight of
the controllers channels there are eight
maximally with this controller and train
maximum throughput and it hosts for 128
gigabit dyes per module with eight
modules that's 32 dyes at 128 gigabit or
16 gigabytes each for a total of 512
gigabytes of storage after subtracting
over-provisioning which we've talked
about in previous videos that comes out
to what you'd see as a 480 ka SSD so
that's the math that's how you get these
512 gigabyte drives or 480 gigabyte
drives it's by having die assortments
like you've seen in our sample here but
what's going on under the NAND there is
SLC mlc TLC they're all associated with
different performance and endurance
metrics and they're targeted at
different parts of the market with mlc
sort of filling a gap as the affordable
but longer-lasting version of NAND with
TLC being the 30% cheaper but more
capacity but potentially shorter
lifespan and and these very hard and
fast rules apply in some ways but aren't
100% correct because there's a lot more
going on underneath and the controller
does dictate just how long a life you
can get out of the NAND NAND is spliced
into an organization structure to ensure
your drive age as well a flash die
consists of a few planes normally -
which are then broken into blocks let's
say there's 1024 of those blocks contain
pages a page is the smallest unit of
data storage on the SSD generally 16
kilobytes in size before going down to
the cell level which is very small the
SSD is split in this way because the
controller moves data constantly to
ensure all the blocks get worn in
equally there's a certain lifespan NAND
flash can only tolerate so many programs
or rights and
so many erases collectively called PE
cycles before the nand expires and
enters a locked read-only state if any
block exhausts its p/e cycles unevenly
it could jeopardize the entire drive and
this is where we could get tangential
and talk about controller technology and
garbage collection we're leveling and
mitigating endurance concerns but we'll
do that in a future video every time you
write data to your SSD you're actively
killing it but the process of we're
leveling and relatively high average PE
cycle count does mean that most users
will exhaust the system's usable life
before that of the SSD alone but there's
more let's look at the cells cells work
at the bit level there are billions of
cells in every SSD each responsible for
its own bit or bits of data and SLC
stands for single-level cell ml c stands
for multi-level cell or 2 levels and TLC
stands for triple level cell so here's
the NAND type for SLC SLC NAND can
contain only one bit of data per cell so
it's smaller in capacity but faster
there are only two possible voltage
states for this cell 1 or 0 and when a
charge is sent to the cell it returns
either a 1 or a 0 for the voltage check
a voltage check sees what data if any
currently occupies that cell and because
there are only two possible voltage
outcomes the device runs with greater
stability and performance than the more
populated multi-level and triple level
cells each of which store exponentially
more voltage levels and require greater
electrical precision at the time of
checking this also means that an SLC SSD
which is rare to find on the market now
would cost more than MLC because MLC can
store twice the bits per cell two bits
per cell and it does for voltage checks
per cell now this means that SLC which
is rare to find these days is more
expensive than something like an LC and
I'll see per gigabyte is cheaper and
that's partly because it can fit two
bits of data per cell and corresponding
with that it's got four voltage levels
per
CEL we're SLC only had two one and zero
TLC then contains three bits of data per
cell so it can hold 33% more data per
cell as MLC but uses eight voltage
levels cost per gigabyte goes
drastically down TLC and mlc but there
is a speed and endurance trade-off TLC
has seven reed points between its
voltage levels mlc has three and SLC has
one more Reed points means more space
for data but greater granularity
required at the electrical level for
voltage checks the electrical charge of
the device weakens as it ages so that
extra granularity for TLC voltage
checking does mean it will generally
become worn out faster than its mlc and
SLC counterparts it can store more data
per cell as cheaper but that means the
cell is being programmed and erased more
frequently which also wears it down it's
a bit slower as a result of the same
voltage checking process but that's a
necessity in having an SSD that's the
trade-off though for cost and capacity
but there's a lot more to it in future
videos and actually in past videos we
have previously and will in the future
talk about over-provisioning and how
it's used to lengthen the lifespan of
nand of different types talk about write
amplification factor what that is you
can actually find that in our SSD
dictionary on gamers Nexus net if you
can expects dictionary at the top and
we'll even talk about some of the other
controller technologies like garbage
collection we're leveling and things of
that nature which are all now changing
with the advent and push of Faiz on and
Marvel controllers into the market as
SandForce somewhat becomes obsolete at
least its second gen until the fabled
third generation maybe one day ships so
that's all for this video check out the
video and the post role to learn about
how SSDs are made in a previous tour of
Kingston's factory that we did actually
a couple years ago now but it's still
relevant and as always patreon like the
