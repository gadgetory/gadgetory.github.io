launch for compatibility even outside of
pre-launch reviews we had issues getting
our retail purchased samples up and
running J noted instability issues
before launch or well at launch Kyle has
tweeted about frustration of trying to
get the AP is working and we've done the
same
finally after lots of troubleshooting
and some talking to AMD and others we
got the AP is working pretty much
smoothly at this point it's actually
going well now
the fact of the matter is that these can
actually be good products as a middle
ground between discrete GPUs and game
ready graphics hardware in APU packaging
but some use cases will require
additional care to get it up and running
and we'll be talking about the steps we
took to get a perfectly stable Raven
Ridge system which should hopefully help
others having similar issues especially
since it's actually out and you can buy
it before that this video is brought to
you by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our temperatures thermal grizzly also
makes traditional thermal compounds we
use on top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydro not pastes learn more at the link
below so this is more or less what half
of the war zone looked like as we were
troubleshooting Raven Ridge trying to
get it up and working and after I sent
out a Valentine's tweet in response to
am the horizons Twitter account
Valentine's tweet they messaged me and
said what problems are you having so we
try and fix it so that was partially
helpful the rest of it that got us to a
functional stable Raven Ridge was just
just beating our heads into the wall
until it worked for like 16 hours
basically so it does work now that's
good we can go over all the issues but a
recap of the problems so some of these
you've seen other youtubers talk about
probably I believe J talked about this
first one which is video TDR failure
it's a blue screen of death we have the
same problem and we were able to find a
solution I'll go through the solutions
separately other issues that we've
encountered or folks we work with have
encountered include large network file
transfer BSOD is on msi motherboards not
sure about the others but I know the
wireless drivers on the msi board for
sure had issues
and one of them was large network file
transfers another one is onboard
Wireless causing a BSOD in general and
issues with version 1703 Windows
versions 1703 freezing or hanging in
potentially resulting in a BSOD as well
so I was another problem we'll talk
about that in a moment because 79 is
required to get it to work I know but
I'll get there gpu-z had a known bsod
issue that will be fixed within days of
this video coming out Windows has a
there's a timer bug with MSI boards that
we showed in a separate video previously
so that was with this board that I think
is a be 350 board from MSI so we showed
a timer bug there where you could
basically trick benchmarks into getting
multiples of the score just by putting
the system to sleep and it would
basically fake the base clock because
the windows time would operate slower
than real time check that video if you
haven't seen it so that was an issue
3dmark installation corruption this
one's really annoying it is fixable
though so that's good but basically
3dmark this box of shaken 3d mark wood
upon certain BSOD user crashes it would
basically break to a point of requiring
an uninstall and reinstall and then
finally some boards like the asrock pro
4 are still severely lacking and bios
options in general and there is a sort
of solution for this as well but it's
not really a great one ideally the
vendors get their BIOS in a shape that
is it's just better but there are half
steps for now so the fixes let's go
through these video TDR failure is the
big one that I think a lot of people
will see and these are all kind of
wrapped up in each other but the short
of this one future mark uses gpu-z
technology the tech power up utility
gpu-z
so future mark uses part of that 3d mark
requires a manual install of the newest
sis info version to get it to not fail
when you're running it on an APU so if
you have 3d mark installed with the sis
info version it comes with then you
might need to go to their website
and manually download the new version
that they just launched and use that
that should fix some blue screen issues
and some issues with three mark
corrupting itself I think I think
they're tied together I'm not clear on
that but either way it'll fix one of
them and the other one will get fixed
through all this other stuff so that's
step one gpu-z
the the maker's techpowerup GPZ they're
all aware of the issue that's all done
by wizard so that should be fixed within
a couple of days at this point also
running GPZ at all will cause a blue
screen doesn't matter if you're using 3d
mark but that will definitely
instantiate the issue because when you
launch leading market it calls for the
sis info file if it's pulling the one
that GPZ includes then that's that's
where the issue occurs the video I think
that's the video TDR failure but either
way it fixed most of our problems so
that's one thing you can do another one
for Windows issues general stability
crashes blue screens freezes and Hanes
so first of all we would recommend
installing the chipset drivers first and
the GPU drivers second because and this
may have changed by now but last I
checked with the retail version of the
product cuz we bought it we weren't
sampled so we actually did do this as
consumers it's not like a pre-launch
complaint but the last I checked the
chipset drivers that I used did contain
the correct driver set for the APU for
Raven Ridge however it contained a an
older or an incompatible GPU driver of
some kind if he didn't Express install
to the effect that installing the GPU
driver first and then the chipset driver
using Express install would result in an
overwrite of the GPU driver so you'd
have the Raven Ridge APU Vega portion
not functioning so we'd have to
reinstall the GP driver yet so chipset
first and GPU next thing we also noticed
that performing a clean install of
Windows version 17:03 via
Microsoft's media creation key the USB
key that you make we noticed that that
and then upgrading to 1709 could further
cause issues so basically the finding
is you know a lot of people have
versions 1703 media creation keys
especially in media cuz we use them all
the time so if you go from that and then
upgrade to 1709 which seems like it
should be sufficient that was causing
some of the Haines and crashes we were
getting and you could scroll through
event viewer and see them popping up so
the fix to that was make a new media
creation key with version 1709 on it the
newest one and install that clean with
no windows upgrade pathways so not using
Windows Update to get from o3 to own.i
you just start at o.9 and the only
reason not to do that is well there's
really there's not a reason not to do
that because it takes even on a slow USB
key it takes minutes to make it so we
would recommend doing that just start at
7:00 to 9:00 you need to do a clean
install to make sure everything works
properly and it'll just it'll make life
way easier to go that route rather than
trying to do the upgrade path which
sadly does not work very well for us
so it may be different this is a big
your mileage may vary thing all these
boards have like half functional BIOS -
pretty much fully functional BIOS depend
on which board it is so that's another
big factor to the gigabyte for example I
think has like three new BIOS revisions
in the last they have three BIOS
revisions that work with Raven Ridge so
that's just a shooting gallery you pick
one and you hope it does what you need
we found testing with the gaming k5
which has some of the best features in
general we found testing with that board
that the absolute latest that time of
filming BIOS revision is the one that
worked the best and the two that
supported Raven Ridge but came out
before or at least one of them anyway
didn't work as well for us so keep that
in mind as well you may need to try a
couple of those as for the rest so
Windows is the big one
gpu-z is a big one that'll be fixed - in
3d mark was also with a Sisson fo thing
a big problem that you wouldn't really
expect that to cause the issue software
shouldn't be causing blue screens but
updating sis info will fix that limited
BIOS settings are kind of a concern but
should somewhat be
although I guess with the x4 70 and B
450 or whatever they call it
so for limited BIOS although we
typically don't like software for
overclocking the CPU or CPU components
like an IGP typically we prefer to do
that through bio it's not through
software but Rison master is
surprisingly not awful so you can
actually use it to overclock the GPU
pretty reasonably it gets stuck stuck
around 1650 1655 something like that so
you get to 16 50 megahertz or so if
you're lucky you push SOC voltage you
can do that through eyes and master as
well so if bios isn't giving you those
options which some of these don't I want
to say this one I think did not have a
GB overclocking options but I've tested
so many boards in such a short period of
time now I can't even keep straight
which ones had issues of the house which
didn't so yeah if it if the board
doesn't do what you want
Ryze and masters okay it's not ideal but
it's okay it works fine a gigabyte I
think has the best BIOS revision for the
IGP overclocking right now but they've
had plenty of issues of their own with
with BIOS if you kind of read through
the forum's with Raven Ridge so it's
gonna come down to your configuration
very specifically in some cases I think
that's most the basics
so to recap it if you have had issues
with Raven Ridge like we did we bought
it on day one I'm sure people out there
bought it on day one if you've had
problems getting it working hopefully
most of those will go away within the
next week like this coming week so I
don't think you're gonna be in the dark
too long
motherboards are kind of a problem a lot
of people were asking about upgrading
motherboards where what do you do if you
buy a board or how do you know if a
board is already good to go with Raven
Ridge and these doing some stuff there
so if you go retail physically the boxes
that actually have the correct BIOS on
it to support Raven Ridge will have a
sticker on them so you buy from Micro
Center that'll make it easy for you
alternatively if you have a shop locally
that can flash bios for you they should
be able to take care of that
and these also I think doing some kind
of flash kit now that I read about so
that should be taken care of but if
you're not aware your board may show up
you put Raven Ridge in it it doesn't do
it's because that's Ron Byers in it so
you need to put Rison in it or figure
out what AMD is doing to support your
region or whatever that boot kit was so
that's one of the other things look out
for but overall some boards keep in mind
also won't support Raven Ridge really I
mean it's like this the crosshair six
it'll work it'll boot and it will
support the CPU but you don't get any
IGP out it has no video out so make sure
you look at the i/o on the boards as
well but yeah recapping the most
important stuff clean install of Windows
version 1709 don't go the upgrade path
it just it sucks so 1709 clean install
3dmark install that and gpu-z if you
want gpu-z you're gonna have to update
it later but install them both and then
after installing them both go manually
grab the new sis info file if it's not
included in the 3dmark package when this
video comes out and then keep an eye out
for GPZ updates like by I don't know
with them between Monday and Wednesday
is it's kind of what my understanding is
so yeah I think everything should smooth
out it's it's been frustrating but it
should smooth ahead it looks like
there's actually like a path to making
sure these bsod issues go away and the
thing is that like I want to call them
minor issues because on one hand these
are problems that will be fixed
pretty soon it's not like an inherent
hardware flaw it's more software and
BIOS and firms like all these things
working together on the other hand they
are technically major issues because
anytime you have a blue screen of death
or it crashed a desktop or system hang
that's a major problem
it's like sev one issue when you're
reporting it and testing so but it
should be fixed if you've had problems
that's how to do it if you haven't had
problems that's awesome I'm happy for
you you whatever you did work then you
got lucky too so yeah not everyone will
have issues getting Raven Ridge working
however clearly
from the reviewer community alone pretty
much everyone's had some kind of problem
along the way somewhere well there's
just wireless drivers causing crash or
this video TDR failure that is more or
less resolvable so yeah our platforms
finally fully stable feeling good about
testing it now for performance doesn't
seem like it's gonna be crashing all the
time and corrupting stuff anymore
so keep an eye out for that subscribe as
always for more go to store that gamers
Nexus Don that to support us directly

if you'd rather support that way thank
you for watching hopefully it works out
for you if you bought Raven Ridge I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
