to answer one of the reader questions or
the viewer questions that you all keep
posting and that question is who makes
the best video card and how do I know
well the thing is we all know that they
all use the same GPU from Nvidia or from
AMD and that GPU does not change which
means your performance will be more or
less identical across the brands except
for overclocking cooling software
support warranties things like that so
we took the opportunity to do a GPU
battle we're calling it and before we
get into that all this coverage is
brought to you by cyber power who make
the fame book we overclocked past four
gigahertz recently so here's the battle
we've got EVGA present MSI present and
PNY gigabytes here as well but they
didn't have a video card rep available
today are out of this battle already
before it even starts so what I did I
went to each vendor and I said you have
less than one minute tell me why your
video card is better than the next
person's I'm talking to I thought this
would be a fun way to give them a
one-to-one means of communication to try
and defend their products and their
choices and of course we've done all our
own reviews if you want 20 minutes of
in-depth about why we think one is
better or worse than the other you can
certainly find that on the channel but
this is a more fun way to address it
very directly so we're going to head
over to the first booth which is either
depending on editing either EVGA or PNY
and see what they have to say about
their video cards alright so now we're
at the EVGA booth and I'm joined by
Jacob Freeman Jacobs same question for
you how do you defend the graphics cards
why is your line better than everyone
else's so I think there's a few reasons
why people like EVGA number one the
number of different options that we
offer on our graph these cards like we
have a water-cooled version or like this
hybrid cold version as well which people
really like a lot and with our ACX
coolers we have a lot of dip
for our customers in addition to that
our warranty we hear that a lot from
even at this show I hear time and time
again about the image a warranty how
they love it and you know we have our
24/7 technical support all that kind of
stuff and on top of that our
overclocking sovery and we spend a lot
of time on dialing it in making sure it
has all the options and knobs and
everything that the enthusiasts are
looking for so I think those are really
the key reasons why people like keep me
Jay cool so there you have it EVGA is
listen reasons listed very succinctly
and let's move on to the next booth so
now we're at the PNY booth I'm with Jay
Chan who's the product manager of
g-force at PNY Jay same question for you
as everyone else why are the PNY video
cards good or better than the
competition

information about this we actually did a
short news post as well I'll link that
below so that's beyond why let's move
over to the next booth and see what they
have to say hey we shoot it so the last
booth for video cards were checking out
is the msi booth you've seen the EVGA
you've seen PNY and now we're here at
msi so mark why do you think your video
cards are better than your competition
the reason why I veto card is better
than our competition is because a lot to
impose their solution and also the MSI
Afterburner you know you can do the best
overclocking you know paired with our
cooling solution that's why we're the
best graphic card on the market so that
