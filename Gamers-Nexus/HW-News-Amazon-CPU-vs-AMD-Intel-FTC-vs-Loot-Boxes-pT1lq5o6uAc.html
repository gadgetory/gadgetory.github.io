recap first up we got an upgrade for
build Zords PCB photos so now we can
take better pictures of these small
components on them this actually came
from Intel we'll be talking about very
briefly about what this is related to
later in the video today but for this
hardware news video we're also talking
about gtx 1060 gddr5 X cards they were
spoiled a little while ago but now they
are finally hitting the market finally
as if as if there was a lot of demand
for them and then jpr finds video card
shipments down 16% Intel planning a 2020
launch for Arctic sound GPUs as reported
by digit x and the FTC investigating
loop boxes everyone's favorite topic
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below and like I said in the other
recent video we did if you want to pick
up one of the shirts like the one I'm
wearing we just added these to the store
on store that game is exes dotnet it's
completely custom designed for GN so
first news item gtx 1060 gddr5 x cards
come in to market AME partners like MSI
and ZOTAC primarily have started working
on GTX 1060 SKUs sounds a bit a bit odd
considering a new generation just
launched if there are still old
generation cards coming out and the new
SKUs are g5x memory enabled they've got
GTA 5 X sub GTR 5 so there have been
different SKUs of 10 60s in the past
with faster memory there was a mine
gigabit per second SKU updated over the
typical eight gigabit per second that
one sort of disappeared on the market
but just to recap everyone just so we're
all on the same page and I might be
missing one here so let me know in the
comments if I miss one but I think the
current listing of gtx 1060 s includes
1066 gigabyte 1063 gigabyte 1065
gigabyte that was a China launched and
then 10 69 gigabits per second and 1060
gddr5 X I feel like I'm missing one
I'm not sure they've been as many GTX 10
60s as AMD presently has for just our
excuse in general so let me know if I'm
leaving one out but the g5 acts cards
we're gonna try and get one whether or
not they are actually worth buying well
I guess depend on the price and if they
end up as a replacement rather than an
upgrade over the existing ten sixties
because some point you just start
bumping into the territory of a better
video card anyway MSI is one of the
first to roll onto these apps they're
rolling out a GTX 1060 armored 6g d5 X
which is a six gigabyte GG r 5x card
that's an OC edition that'll retain the
expected 1208 cuda cores or lanes on
vectors and then it comes equipped with
a six gigabyte capacity of g5x
expectedly card will run base and boost
1544 in 1759 megahertz with memory
clocks at 2002 megahertz or an effective
8000 eight megahertz and that's across a
192 bit memory bus there's no tax part
they are offering the new gtx 1066 you
buy DDR 5 X destroyer card and this will
run reference frequencies of 1509 sevens
you know eight megahertz base and boost
respectively
same thing for the rest though so the
newer F II cards equipped with gddr5 X
will be selling for $300 and these a IB
models will probably be in that bracket
if not a bit north of the $300 mark
we'll talk about it more this kind of
follows the other news items that we
report on I think of the last episode
yes where we talked about Nvidia's board
partners facing severe overstock issues
and NVIDIA itself facing overstock
issues of GP 104 GPUs so this follows up
in that story with means of trying to
offload tell that supply so they can
launch an RT X 2060 or GTX 2060 card
sometime next year probably jpr finds
video card shipments are down 16 percent
we've discussed AMD and NVIDIA earnings
briefly lately and how those numbers
Illustrated the effects of the
cryptocurrency mining rug being pulled
out from under both companies
preliminary information from John petty
research paints a similar
picture so JP ours research shows that
video card shipments are down 16% in
third quarter 2018 year-over-year and
down 19.2% from second quarter 2018
JP are also predicts the overstock in
the channel will extend into 2019
shrinking profits for vendors JP are
states that the us-china trade war and
stock market dips have led to a slow
sell-off of excess inventory both AMD
and NVIDIA have stated that they believe
the inventory surplus will take multiple
quarters to correct and have adjusted
their fourth quarter 2018 expectations
accordingly and this is following some
contradictory statements previously
where both companies more or less said
we're not making any money on cryptic
cryptocurrency mine or any meaningful
amount of money and then suddenly all of
their healthcare revenue reports are
down when cryptocurrency mining crashes
so making a bit there anyway next one
Intel planning a 2020 launch for Arctic
Sound the GPU as noted by digit Times
Online a digitized report says that
Intel is planning to announce the
arrival of its discrete GPU codenamed
Arctic sound at an unknown conference in
December featuring Raja Kaduri and other
Intel officials an attack previously
reported on Intel's assembler
architecture event and we're gonna be
there that's why we got this thing but
what we don't know yet is what the
architecture event will be about so it
could be completely unrelated we don't
know if it's gonna be CPU GPU or some
SSDs or opting there's they make a lot
of things so there could be two events
here in December we're not clear on it
but either way we're gonna be at an arc
event
it's just what that will be about
specifically we don't yet know what we
do know though from other reporting is
that or just their own announcements in
general Intel's got several CES keynotes
coming up some in automotive and things
like that and none of them presently
mentioned the presence of Arctic sound
as far as we're aware
doesn't mean it won't be there also
doesn't mean it will be there
speculation has been rife regarding
Arctic sound and many place its arrival
in 2020 in fact Intel's previous teaser
video after bringing on the one of the
former and the lead marketing guys and
these Chris hook they made a video
saying to expect the graphics device in
I think it amounted to 20/20 so we kind
of have that as a known date at this
point it does a third attempt now at
crossover success in the GPU market they
previously attempted to break into GPUs
in 1998 and in 2009 one of those was
Larrabee Arctic sound is expected to be
leveraged for gaming AI and big markets
like machine learning so Intel has yet
to confirm anything officially other
than the teaser video we saw a couple
months ago
next up the FTC will investigate loop
boxes as esa continues to try and defend
the existence of loot boxes so loot
boxes have long been a point of
controversy or a discussion alongside
microtransactions kind of a new approach
to micro transactions additionally an
increasingly concerned public has pushed
back against game makers for including
loot boxes in their games this is
particularly citing their similar
similarity to gambling and the arguably
predatory marketing towards a younger
audience and that's why it's gotten some
attention now from politicians even so
the FTC the Federal Trade Commission in
the US has agreed to investigate loot
boxes on behalf of Senator Maggie Hassan
this is a quote from Senator Hassan who
said loot boxes are now endemic in the
video game industry and are present in
everything from casual smartphone games
to the newest high budget releases also
warning that children are an especially
easy target for loop boxes the ESA the
Entertainment Software Association has
defended loot boxes in the past
attempting to debunk any parallels
between loot boxes and gambling the ESA
has also stated that it prefers
self-regulation for the games industry
rather than government regulation
polygon reached out to the ESA
four-count regarding the investigation
and the ESA had this quote loot boxes
are one way that players can enhance the
experience that video games offer
contrary to assertions loot boxes are
not gambling they have no real world
value players always receive something
that enhances their experience and they
are entirely optional to purchase they
can enhance the experience for those who
choose to use them but have no impact on
those who do not which is almost
certainly objectively false but that
depends on which game you're looking at
so this sidesteps the possible predatory
targeting of children and the education
of parents which is ultimately what
Senator Hassan is after and it's always
comes down to protection for the younger
crowd with games and sometimes depending
on on what area you're looking at for
games it's really more led by people who
don't know what they're talking about
but in this instance loot boxes I think
have been pretty much universally
disliked moving on from loot boxes
Amazon in the news again Amazon is back
in hardware news this week dealing a
second blow to serve a partner Intel
after recently announcing that it would
be deploying I am the epic chips and
some of its AWS solutions Amazon has now
announced that it is working to make its
own ARM based instances with its own
graviton CPU the ARM based graviton is a
64-bit processor created by annapurna
labs a chip company Amazon acquired in
2015 it will power the new a1 instances
being made available to all AWS
customers a1 instances are supposed to
offer up to a 45 percent lower price
than Intel or even AMD instances so you
can now purchase an Amazon basics server
room if you wish with the Annapurna
Annapurna
graviton CPU ARM based processor cadence
I'm on the first to use Samsung's seven
LPP solution Samsung announced last
month that it's seven nanometer UV
lithography process was available and
ready for mass production now it appears
that cadence is among the first to
leverage that process as they recently
announced they've taped out their gzg r6
IP using Samsung 7l PP g DDR memory has
seen limited use cases outside of
graphics cards but the big memory makers
like micron and Samsung have indicated
interest in the adoption of g6 for non
GPU applications for once so to give us
some specific examples cadence thinks
that it can use G DDR 6 for things like
AI instances or SOC s
things like that and machine-learning
autonomous vehicles cryptocurrency
blockchain all major buzzwords that
cadence has used recently for its
potential use cases cadence if you don't
know is a company that makes some
software as well for
things like parametric analysis and for
signal integrity solutions so they are a
fairly large company in the space they
work with most of the larger
manufacturers and engineering firms as
well cadence is GDR 6ip should be moving
to 16 gigabytes per second per pen and
have a 500 gigabit per second peak
bandwidth between the SOC and each DDR 6
dot and the IP solution will be packaged
as it'll be a single package design
allowing customers to replicate
Cadence's results in their own products
next extreme tech reporting a rumor that
AMD may double down on l3 cache for 7
nanometer epic CPUs coming up soon and
these 7 animator epic chips dubbed roam
which we've discussed previously have
now appeared in the SCI software
standard database and this possibly
indicates a changed the cache hierarchy
with the new epic CPUs so the database
entry has since been deleted but
overclocked 3d was able to get a
screenshot of that and there's not much
to go on here but in the screenshot the
database entry refers to quote AMD
engineering sample which of course
indicates a pre-production sample from
engineering so interestingly it's listed
with a 16 by 16 megabyte l3 cache
configuration assuming that listing is
accurate and it may not be this breaks
down to form a gigabytes per core double
that of the previous 2 megabyte per core
solution with AMD epoch while this isn't
fully confirmed and we're not clear on
all of the changes that Andy is making
to it's 7 nanometer solution for the
server roam silicon doubling l3 cache
would certainly not advantages in
latency with some of the workloads that
that AMD has struggled with in the past
so new 3d mark ray tracing benchmark up
next this is the last news item we have
for today and this is from ul benchmarks
which is the company that used to be
known as future mark before they were
acquired by Underwriters Laboratories ul
benchmarks announced that there's a new
3d mark port royal benchmark coming up
and it's the newest to be added to the
benchmark suite in the 3d mark suite
it's a ray tracing benchmark and it uses
a direct x-ray trace and our D XR which
is a Microsoft solution that Nvidia is
also leveraging
RTX solution so UL benchmarks notes that
the benchmark isn't exclusive to
anybody's r-tx technology although it
does require DXR the benchmark was
developed with input from Nvidia AMD
Intel Microsoft and others and should
work with any graphics card with drivers
supporting DXR and the ray-tracing api
as it stands that's currently limited to
nvidia RT x-series cards but that may
change in the future
portroyal is supposedly an example of
what realistic and practical ray-tracing
will look like in upcoming games as the
benchmark uses a ray tracing effects in
real time with a resolution of 1440 P
it'll be added to the 3d mark test suite
in January of 2019 and the first
demonstration of this will be at an
overclocking event coming up in December
and that's it for this week's roundup so
subscribe as always for more you get a
store da Gama's axis net to pick up a
shirt like this one or one of our mod
mats that I have on the table in front
of me and these will be coming back in
stock in the next probably two weeks or
so as well if you wanted one of those
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
