pieces showing that deleting can improve
thermal performance of Intel CPU
significantly but we've always put the
stock Intel heat spreader back in place
today we're trying a $20 accessory it's
a cnc machined copper IHS that we bought
from rocket cool which purportedly
increases service area by a claimed 15
percent and smooths out the points of
contact Intel stock IHS is a nickel
plated copper block but it's smaller and
exposed surface area than the rocket
cool alternative at fourteen to twenty
dollars it seemed worth trying out today
we're looking to see if there's any
meaningful difference in thermal
performance for the Intel i7 8700 K when
using the stock versus the aftermarket
copper IHS before getting to that this
video is sponsored by Dollar Shave Club
makers of the new five dollar shower
shave starter set the kit includes the
Dollar Shave Club executive razor
bearing the EPS of any high-quality tool
and also includes reloadable cartridges
the five dollar kit includes everything
you see on the screen now like the body
wash and shave butter and can be
refilled for a few dollars a month this
deal is available for $5 exclusively

this is pretty simple on the surface of
it to get everyone up to speed and
integrated heat spreader by intel that
sort of silver looking one is actually
copper it's just nickel plated and it's
not the shiny kind either so it is a
copper IHS or integrated heat spreader
this is a copper IHS it's not nickel
plated it doesn't really matter a lot
what matters more here is that this has
a slightly larger surface area which is
done just by kind of the Intel IHS has
some more lower down dead zones around
the outer edges of it it's made to fit
basically all the Intel CPUs of the same
socket type so it's not like they custom
tune it this is custom tune 2 for LGA
1150 RIA so it's ultimately surface area
that matters because that's increasing
the amount of contact area between the
IHS and the cooling element on top of it
or the heatsink I should say the cold
plate so that's what we care about
replacing it's pretty easy it's you can
watch any of our d-lighting videos
it's the same process you've popped the
CPU into a tea litter you deal it it and
then you pull the IH ace off and start
to replace it with this one in the
process of doing so there are a couple
things to watch out for like the
alignment of these ridges on the outer
edges there is a guide that's pretty
good you need to basically make sure
that the arrow is aligned with the arrow
and the D litter and then you just mount
this on to it the only downside so
there's a couple things to watch out for
here reel it in or resealing a component
whenever you reseal an Intel CPU there's
a really good chance that you just
killed all of your D lighting
performance improvement because from
doing this several times now for
multiple youtubers as well I can tell
you ideally you do not reseal it with
silicone adhesive you leave the thing
deleted yes you put the IHS back on
however when you put it back on we
recommend that you just sort of you drop
the cpu into the socket without ever
moving it any other way you hold the CPU
and the IHS like this in transit and
don't let it slide around but also don't
reseal it so the downside to that is you
can't really move the CPU in any kind of
normal way to be really careful about it
so if there's no sliding you don't have
the liquid metal run over onto
components on ties on these or you don't
have the liquid metal just loose contact
in general however the upside is that
you don't have a sealant around the
edges that will increase the sort of Z
height between or the gap between the
IHS and the die that's what tills
performance and that's actually on an
Intel CPU more of what kills performance
in some cases than the thermal paste
alone so it's you want to avoid silicone
adhesive resealing so for our testing we
tested without resealing the cpu i
dropped it into the socket with the
liquid metal applied how I wanted it and
that was just the bare substrate with a
die and I put the liquid metal on this
side it's kind of I mean it's it's
basically stained now that's not
actually liquid anymore but I put the
liquid metal on this side and then drop
that just on top of the CPU right
I wanted it as the instructions
recommended latched it down and then put
the cooler on that's what I would
recommend because when I did try
resealing this because it is easier to
transport it but it just it kills the
thermals and you introduce a lot of
variants it's not worth it just just do
it without the sealant so let's get into
some of the data here test methods we
use the liquid metal conduct or not so
this is a thermal grizzly conductor not
that we used between the die and the
heat spreader on both the Intel and the
aftermarket solution we ran three tests
and for each of those three tests three
tests per i HS so six total times an
additional three tests so like eighteen
and so we had basically three sets of
frequencies and voltages tested three
times each so three iterations and then
in between each of those we reapplied
the liquid metal and the thermal paste
and then averaged all the data throw it
on anything that looks bad because
there's a lot of human element involved
here where application of thermal pay is
on top of the IHS can very application
of liquid metal under the IHS can vary
so hence running three different
iterations of them or test passes and
averaging and it looked pretty good
after all that so fairly consistent
overall we established a plus or minus
about point seven degrees run Tehran
variants with those reapplications and
additional information on testing will
be in the article linked in the
description below as always but we can
get as the charts now so this chart is
really what we ultimately ended up with
that five gigahertz and one point four
two volts we end up generating between
two hundred watts and 220 watts at the
EPS 12 volt cables that configuration
isn't on here it's just in between the
other two so depending on the test
that's where you're at for wattage 200
to 220 watts and they give or take
couple watts of course for the two
tested voltages here stock temperature
monitoring showed 49 point five degrees
Celsius over ambient for baseline
average of all core temperatures and
that's also averaged after a 30 minute
burnin mark on our X 62 with max fan
speeds which allows the radiator to soak
and hit equilibrium the peak ten-second
high was 51 point six degrees Celsius
with
liquid temperature at thirteen point
eight degrees Celsius for the rocket
cool IHS we measured forty four point
five degrees for the same test or forty
eight point two across the peak high and
liquid was roughly equivalent within
margin of error these differences
between the temperatures are just
outside of error margins and we can only
confidently say that they are outside of
the margins of error because we ran the
test enough times to establish what kind
of variance we had which was not a whole
lot so with each one of these using a
new liquid metal and paste application
we end up looking pretty even across the
board scoring about the same from run to
run this helps ensure that we're using
the same application technique each time
we're all seasoned graduated syringe for
the thermal paste to make sure that it's
an even amount each time the result is a
slight temperature improvement with the
rocket cool solution roughly in the
range of three to five degrees Celsius
so not at all bad for a copper brick
that you replace the Intel one with and
at one point four four volts and five
point one gigahertz we saw nearly
identical Delta's to the previous the
stock IHS reported fifty six point eight
degrees or 60 degrees peak high
temperature and the rocket cool IHS
resulted in a fifty one point eight
degree average or 56 point five degrees
for the ten second high the improvement
again is a range of about three to five
degrees depending on how loose you are
with your error margins and liquid
temperatures are about the same as for
temperature over time the IH has changed
doesn't meaningfully impact or elongate
the heating period in our test setup the
rocket cool kit is routinely shown below
the stock IHS by a few degrees but
there's no actual change the ramp up or
the ramp down time for temperature at
least not one that exits error margins
one more reason that the custom copper
IHS helps here is less about the extra
surface area and there is more because
if you look at the Intel one it's got
that lowered surface around the edges
and the custom one takes the whole
service area but it's less about that
and also about the flatness of the
surface the intel heat spreader stock is
actually very slightly convex and the
asa tech cold plate some of the other
cold plates on the market are
we concave this is to somewhat account
for the bend in the Intel IHS but not
everyone does it and also you've got two
modes of manufacturing tolerance to deal
with there where now you're relying on
both Intel and the cold plate
manufacturer to align perfectly with
their concave and convex bends this is
is flatter it removes that it's actually
basically perfectly flat and ultimately
when you mount it all down anyway most
the cold plates kind of become flat just
from the mounting pressure to begin with
so that's another big contributor aside
from the extra service area as far as
the copper versus the nickel plated
copper that probably has very little to
do with anything here it's all copper at
the end of the day so what we're really
looking at is the other factors
mentioned overall that is pretty
straightforward we got a couple degree
improvement and honestly it's more than
I was expecting for it's $14 without the
real ed tool if you already have the d
Lloyd kit it's a bit easier to get with
but I had twenty dollars for the
complete kit it's really not bad I was
pleasantly surprised with how well this
works now when I say how well it worked
I mean relative to its price relative to
the effort involved and relative to what
it is piece of copper now it's a nicely
machined piece of copper and rocky cool
did a great job of it this isn't
something that's going to change a lot
for you in terms of your overclocking
Headroom it's probably not going to
change a lot you for you in terms of
voltages it's all gonna be about the
same as where it was before you might be
able to very marginally reduce your fan
speeds you might be able to very
marginally reduce your cooler size but
this is it's it's one of those
enthusiast items that if you asked me is
it worth buying straight out no no extra
is tagged on to that at all not is it
worth buying as an enthusiast is it
worth fine for budget user be just
straight ask me is it worth $20 I'd
probably say no in terms of just I mean
it doesn't it doesn't do a ton for you
however from an enthusiast perspective
in terms of you're already deleting the
CPU already putting liquid metal on it
I'm actually pretty happy with it so I
would buy one but I would also buy
not expecting a lot out of it you get a
couple degrees what does that really do
for you if you already know if you have
a target in mind I need an extra couple
degrees to get to this threshold that
will numerically satisfy my OCD or
something like that if you already have
an objective then yes it's worth picking
up I wouldn't buy it expecting a lot in
terms of overclocking but it's never bad
to run at a lower temperature either
that's always pretty much a good thing
in 99% of cases so yeah it's a pretty
happy with it
and I would recommend it if you're just
kind of like you want a Saturday project
you want to play around with computer
parts for 20 bucks for an hour so it's
pretty good project for that but outside
of that it is a bit of work it's not
hard but I did have to reapply it a
couple times that when I first went
through with it to make sure I'd aligned
it correctly
make sure the liquid metal wasn't
sliding around underneath just like any
dealin process I mean yeah don't expect
great things but you can expect decent
things out of it and I think other than
that do keep in mind that if you try to
validate your own thermals run to run
like before-and-after it is pretty hard
to actually run thermal test properly
you'll want to use probably something
like hardware info to log and do it over
time don't just spot check it and then
run averages and you'll also probably
want like a current clamp on the EPS
12-volt cables so you can make sure
these software is pushing the same
amount of current into the CPU each time
because running blender or prime or
whatever pass a to pass B there can
certainly be variants of sometimes 20
watts and that's enough to eliminate
some of the advantages you might see or
even you can make one look worse than
the other if the power input is
different so if you're trying to
validate your own numbers make sure you
control as much as possible and get
something on there to read the power and
then you should be good hardware info
does a pretty good job at reading the
wattage from most CPUs you can use that
for pretty much everything in lieu of a
current clamp so yeah overall very quick
recap here is for $20 I do really like
the idea of just a fun
Saturday enthusiast project because it's
so cheap that it's basically something
you do because you haven't messed around
with your computer in a while
and you feel like that'd be fun there is
not much more reason than that that I
would buy it you know you might as well
just buy a better cooler if you're
really digging for temperature
improvements and the deal is do a lot
for you anyway but it's still admirable
for you know a small thing like the Hat
get a couple degrees out of it so that's
it for this one pretty fun if you have
suggestions for similar stuff like this
like small computer component
accessories enthusiast type products
that you don't see a lot of tests for we
like working with these it's fun to do
it's not a big expense to buy it so let
