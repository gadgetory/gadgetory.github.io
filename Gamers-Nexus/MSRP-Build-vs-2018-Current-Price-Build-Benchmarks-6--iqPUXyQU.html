would you go back to a correct answer is
2016 so that you can invest in
cryptocurrency and system memory and
also GPUs because two of those
investments have increased a few X in
just this last year the ignoring
cryptocurrency which we don't need to
talk about that because it catalyzed the
other one but either way right now today
this video card a gtx 1070 gaming ax
from msi costs about nine 800 to 900
dollars 800 on a really good day and
although the stock sometimes does refill
if you can catch it you get it at closer
to MSRP 400 or so 450 maybe that's
pretty uncommon and it's wishful
thinking that any more than a couple
people will ever find those deals so in
all likelihood in reality you're
probably paying several hundred dollars
more for a ten seventy then you should
be to the point where it has become the
same price as this card a 10 80 TI when
it launched before that this video is
brought to you by the gamers Nexus at
patreon and our patreon backers you want
to help us out directly you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and check with the
GN team or you can support us at five
dollars or higher and get access to
behind the scenes videos as we release
them once or twice a month
learn more at the link in the
description below so for this video this
one was a comment or suggestion on one
of our previous videos about GPU and
memory prices and the suggestion was do
a $1000 build at MSRP versus a $1000
build at today's current prices and that
was actually a great idea we upped it a
bit we went to 1500 to give us some room
because memory and GPUs are so insanely
expensive so we went to $1500 that was
our limit pulled components from our
shelves and basically the goal was what
can you fit in $1500 today versus at
either launch prices or the lowest
available prices in recent history
so for memory for example actually we'll
just go through the whole specs from
memory this one's pretty painful
the g.skill to buy 4 gigabyte ddr4
thirty two hundred megahertz pretty good
memory was $45 at its lowest in 2016
today that kid of memory is more than a
hundred dollars it's between 100 and 140
depending on where you buy it and when
the video card if you buy a GTX 1080i in
the back here would have been at its
lowest $700 for an EVGA 1080i SC not the
icx card 700 bucks from B&amp;amp;H photo for
actually a significant a period of time
and now those cards are $1500 so that's
where the market is today that that one
card today would blow our entire budget
for this $1500 proposed PC build let's
go through the specs and then run some
benchmarks there's no real point to this
content other than to make everybody
feel bad about how expensive everything
is you're welcome so for the specs the
current price build is using a gtx 1070
gaming X we found one for $800 obviously
didn't buy it because we already have
one but 800 bucks absolutely do not buy
this card for that much money and that's
a cheap one they tend to go 850 to 900
we also found a CPU an 80 600 K at
around the correct price $260 and paired
it with $110 e 370 board pretty cheap
board and then memory was 104 dollars
for 8 gigabytes at ddr4 2800 so we had
to step it down a bit if we compare
these specs to our MSRP or lowest price
in the last couple years build we have a
$700 GPU so let me just kind of just
point this out that's a $100 cheaper
than the 1070 and it's like three full
classes above it and performance so a
$700 GPU and then we also saw the 8700 K
for 370 dollars we were able to fit a
hundred total board into the budget it's
an ultra gaming board not my favorite
motherboard out there for Z 370 but it's
one we had and then ram here's a here's
a fun one ram 50 bucks
actually technically at its lowest it
was about 42 for this particular kit of
2 by 4 gigabyte ddr4 3200 memory from
g.skill today more than a hundred bucks
actually for a while that kind of memory
was 70 so it was 42 at the best 70 for a
long time then it skyrocketed
pick anywhere in there you got a big
disk on verse today in fact the at the
same price point today for eight
gigabytes of ddr4 2800 you could two
years ago have gotten 16 gigabytes of
ddr4 3200 which is pretty sad to think
about so the the big thing here with
these builds is the extra room afforded
by the more reasonably priced to GPU
allows us to go from an 80 600 K to an
80 700 K obviously allows us to get a
better GPU significantly better and a
better motherboard so i can sustain
better overclock it gives us a little
bit of room to play for a cpu cooler of
some kind not an expensive one but a
decent one and then you could probably
get a slightly better power supply as
well we just stuck with a and assumed a
$60 PSU cost for these we'd recommend a
bit better at $1500 but we're trying to
keep some stuff simple so that we can
match the two builds against one another
so let's let's get into the benchmarks
and allow the slaughter to commence
destiny 2 starts us off for a DirectX 11
title at 1080p and highest settings our
MSRP build with the 1080 I was bumping
up against a 200 FPS limiter so the
average would actually be higher than
what we can show here if we could have
exceeded the 200 FPS cap regardless
we're still averaging 179 with lows
respectively at 125 and 111 fps the
current price build including the CPU
overclocked variant landed at 136 137
FPS average this leaves the MSRP build a
lead of about 30% which is actually
quite low compared to the next test that
we're going through at 4k and still
highest settings our MSRP build is about
60% ahead because we're not limited by
the FPS cap anymore making 77 FPS
averages and nearly 60 FPS at low as
possible thanks primarily to the would
be $700 1080i
by contrast the currently priced 800 de
$150 gtx 1070 operated an average of
FPS with it low is falling to 40 the
framerate difference is perceptible and
definitely noticeable Sniper Elite 4
provides us a highly optimized DirectX
12 title something rather rare right now
for this one at 1080p
we saw average frame rates of 225 FPS
for the MSRP build stretching the limits
of the CPU and the GPU jointly toward
the upper end of the build the current
price build ran at 138 FPS average
depending on overclock resulting in the
MSRP build leading by about 61% 4k shows
similar results scaling with the current
price to build exhibiting occasional
tearing while the MSRP build operates a
frame rate in excess of 80 fps doom
provides a Vulkan API look at
performance for this one because doom
runs so well we're using 4k as the only
test resolution asynchronous compute is
enabled as it enables at zero
anti-aliasing now though some people
still haven't gotten that memo and with
these settings we're at 110 FPS average
with the MSRP build low is hovering
above 80 fps the build with modern
pricing sits at around 66 FPS average so
we are once again about 67% ahead with
the amaz RP build Ghost Recon wildlands
brings us back to dx11 this title built
by Ubisoft which deserves its own
category because they're so bad at
optimizing games and I'm sorry people
doesn't have quite as much of a lead in
this game but still sits at 118 FPS
average at 1080p versus 84 to 86 FPS
average for the build with modern
pricing scaling is similar at 4k where
we go from 36 FPS to 57 FPS average
civilization 6 mostly just pulls from
previous test data from our reviews as
the AI turn time benchmark is entirely
CPU bound the MSRP builds it completes
turns in about 16 seconds with the
current price build using an 86 hundred
K finishing turns in about 17.5 seconds
per turn this place is the 8700 K about
8.6 percent reduced and required time
per turn which adds up when you have
lots of turns until your own memory
speed does not seem to affect this
benchmark very much at all as we
previously demonstrated with the 8400 at
30
200 megahertz and 20 66 megahertz where
we saw the same performance blender cpu
performance with largely aligned with
what we've shown in our CPU reviews as
there is no dependency on the GPU and
there's a very little difference between
twenty eight hundred and thirty-two
hundred megahertz memory on these Intel
CPUs these numbers place the I 580 600 K
at around 39 minutes time to complete
the monkeyhead render accelerating 233
minutes when overclocked 8700 K is
faster even one stock at twenty six
point five minutes or twenty four
minutes when overclocked again as
expected a major loss in effective PC
performance at modern prices versus
original list prices which sustained for
several months
blender CUDA rendering is done using the
1080i for the MSRP build and the 1070
for the current price build Landing us
at 16 minutes to render a 4k frame for
the MSRP build and 22 minutes for the
modern build MSRP build completes the
render with a 28% time reduction from a
modern day PC of the same $1500 price
point and this is a significant loss in
performance for anyone doing CUDA 3d
rendering at home we also ran 3d mark
firestrike with its normal settings
resulting in a predictable massive
scoring advantage for the MSRP build the
1080i and 8700 K understandably lead the
ten seventy and eighty six hundred K
even overclocked
by about forty five percent that's
without overclocking the 8700 K so the
point then if we have to have one is
that if you are new to PC building or
you're returning after a hiatus bad news
it's pretty expensive right now everyone
knows that we've been kind of talking
about that for the last couple days
without Ram pricing and GPU pricing
discussions but this really drives at
home we're at $1500 you can get a
significantly better computer and we
didn't even try that hard I mean if I
really tried if if we had new egg from
2016 or let's call it 2017 for GPU
prices accessible to us today it would
have been pretty easy to dig through it
find things with good rebates combo
deals all kinds of incentives to buy the
different memory or GPU packs before
price
insane depending on which year you're
looking at for data and you know if you
really tried at it you could put
together a better power supply than we
have in there you could have back then
put a better cooler in there things like
that that would really make the build
just overall a much more complete build
unfortunately we obviously have to work
with the retail prices of today and no
one has incentives for anything because
there's no reason to offer you Han if
everyone's buying all the stock for GPUs
so yeah that's a you've got in some
cases a sixty seven percent performance
lead with a build that you could have
assembled in reality - this isn't just
Fantasyland like a little over a year
ago or a year ago for talking 1080i when
it came out in March
so yeah that's it's very unfortunate if
you want to build a computer probably
the best thing to do is you can get
mostly components at a reasonable price
memory you can't do anything about just
bite bite the bullet and get whatever
you can at a reasonable price GPU is the
best thing to do is show up at a
retailer and ask them when their
shipment will come in and then buy it
off the shelf that day when the price is
should be acceptable like close to MSRP
it's just they won't have a lot of them
alternatively tamped Newegg in Amazon
and B and H and everyone else and try
and grab a card when they refresh
because if you look at the GPU price
this is what the rumor mill websites
completely butchered when they did their
initial reports the GPU pricing on these
retailers is actually not that insane
it's the third-party markets that do it
and you can look at the price history
yourself on PC part picker newegg.com
lists most of its 10 ATT is as yes
increased in price but the 10 ATT is C
from EVGA that we used as an example
here is a it was a $700 card when new I
gets it in stock they sell it for
between 754 and 780 it is absolutely a
premium that you should not have to pay
ten percent added margin on that but
it's not the $1500 price that you'll see
plastered all over news stories and on
Newegg and on Amazon but if you look
through it it's because those are
third-party sellers they're basically
scalpers who bought the card when it
came in relisted it for two times the
price and the ripping you off for it so
just be careful where you're buying from
make sure on those pages
you sort down to the retailer first
party they probably won't have it in
stock that's almost certainly why you're
seeing $1500 for these cards but you
know just try and wait basically is the
point here because if you're impatient
right now and it may you might genuinely
just need a PC so you don't have a
choice in that case but if it's just a
patience issue the difference here is
nearly 2 X in some cases it's not worth
it just just try and get a GP if you can
but that's that I don't have any other
tips for you that's all I got so yeah
unfortunately the pricing but great
suggestion by the user who posted that
