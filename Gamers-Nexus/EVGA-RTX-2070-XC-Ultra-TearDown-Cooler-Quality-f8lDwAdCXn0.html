RTX 20 70s manufacturers had to cut a
lot of corners and we might talk about
that more later and it's not really the
manufacturers the board partners to
blame on this foley because there are
reasons working with nvidia that they do
have to meet those $500 price points and
so what we're doing today is we're
looking at what's the difference between
a $500 MSRP card like the 20 70 black
from EVGA and a good one a $550 card now
that the black version is fine but an
extra 50 bucks does get you a whole lot
more cooler it goes from two slots into
point seven slots and the fan profile is
quite different you'll see that in our
review if you're curious the BRM is
different the PCB is significantly
larger there's more stuff on there and
these things are just thermocouples
ignore those we're gonna reclaim those
later so there's a big difference
between a cheap $500 cooler and totally
like this and we'll talk about this more
later I suppose but it does largely come
down to the way NVIDIA has structured
this launch and the need to have $500
price target cards this time and not
have everything be way over the
advertised MSRP like you saw for the
2080 TI and the 2080 so let's take it
apart and see what's inside before that
this video is brought to you by us and
the limited edition foil Graf logo shirt
this four color foil shirt is the iconic
GN Graf logo with average 1% and point
1% bar colors it's printed on a soft
high-quality and custom made 100% cotton
shirt and is available on store dye
Karen's Nexus night until stock runs out
once it's gone we will not be making
more of these shirts we sold out within
two weeks of our previous
limited-edition shirts so click on the
link below to preorder now so this
teardown is pretty straightforward first
of all you need the cards 20 70 XE ultra
for this and we're working with just two
primary screwdrivers it's just a larger
Phillips and the smaller Phillips for
the screws in the back plate these are
all one size and then we're working on
our GN mod mat which is on stored at
gaming section that if you want to pick
up one of those
and these wires sticking out these are
just for k-type thermocouple x' that we
smash in there for thermal testing so
those obviously do not come included
although we wouldn't be opposed to it it
would save some money so we're gonna
reclaim those in the process of tearing
this down it's a pretty standard EVGA
backplate design one major upside from
previous from the 10 series is they're
no longer mixed in and actually one of
the XE ultra on the 28 ET I did this
they're no longer mixing the the actual
like screw head size where sometimes
they'll have three that are much smaller
and you have these different size bit on
them which is unnecessary and very
annoying so they're not doing that here
pretty straightforward we've bunch of
these to take out then actually know
what we can stop in the middle of this
so I can show you something if we take
out just the four cooler screws first I
was doing all of them cuz we're gonna
take it all apart anyway but if we do
the four cooler screws you'll see just
how easy this card is to take apart as
we found out when we put the
thermocouples on them so let's get the
last two okay so the screws removed so
far for the backplate are irrelevant
removing these four will instantly free
the cooler and you get this piece this
is just like a cable cover it doesn't do
anything so you get that off disconnect
the cable and it does have an awful lot
of pins in it but it's it's fairly safe
to pull out we would still recommend
doing it a bit safer than either there
that's all it takes to get the cooler
off which is really nice we don't
typically see them that easy to work
with so four screws to service the
cooler and the thermal paste big props
to EVGA for making that easy it's on
there secure enough that they don't
really need more screws than that so
pretty straightforward for that part
which makes servicing the card
exceptionally easy and that is a good
thing for people who want the ability to
easily replace their own paste later if
you're going to try and improve it as
the paste cures or something like that
this one threads into a knot on the
other side just pull both those
okay so screw count in the back side is
gonna be sat them up 1 2 3 4 6 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
20 screws in the backside not too bad
but we do have to take off some other
parts as well and we'll get to those so
first of all the back plate does have a
lot of thermal pads on it we have a test
for throat for the back plate there's no
back plate in the review if you're
curious what the difference is it's not
a lot it'll definitely do something
under some conditions but not the
conditions we tested in and we have seen
times with back way toward actually is
significant we've seen times where it's
completely irrelevant whether they make
contact either way though making contact
to a metal backplate is certainly better
than being hotbox that's just down there
with no thermal pads so that's a good
thing to see even if it doesn't do a
whole lot for GPU VR a more memory cool
and it doesn't do negative things and
that's good and then topside we can't
remove the base plate just yet first we
need to remove three screws that are
hidden in the back those are right there
so it's these three the rest of them can
remain in there all these i/o screws can
remain just need to pull those out okay
so there's there's three and now the
part that was securing is right here so
this can be easily removed and that's
connected to the base plate yes okay
okay so we've reclaimed the
thermocouples and now I can show you the
rest of the board looks awfully familiar
looks pretty similar to a twenty eighty
F EE PCB and that makes sense because
it's an actually ultra cooler that's on
the 20 AT&amp;amp;T ICS as well
maybe was easier to transplant that way
but either way thermal pads everywhere
as he BGA tends to do and the big thing
here on their baseplate is that they are
now doing a a heat pipe under here which
we can reveal with a spudger so under
here this thermal pad that connects to
the MOSFETs and some of the capacitors
adjacent to the MOSFETs you will see a
nickel plated copper heat pipe there it
is and this is a kind of a new thing
that GPU or video card board partners
are doing lately it's not new new but
it's something that hasn't been on cards
in this class before so that's measuring
at 11 millimeters on the calipers which
in reality is is probably about 10 tip
is the typical size for these there we
go so it's about 10 millimeters after
rezero in it and it's really short heat
pipe so doesn't doesn't affect a whole
lot just the most important part which
is the MOSFETs and most likely to get
the hottest anyway and then next to that
you've got your inductor line plate and
this is just a nickel plated copper
plate it does not have a heat pipe in it
but it is attached to the heat pipe
adjacent to then doctors just pull some
of this up so this surface and bumps up
a little bit there
for clearance and also to connect the
heat pipe with another surface and leave
them both roughly the same height so
that's that's the primary part of the
cooling for the vrm and then vram cool
lines all around there the board itself
it does move - to power headers and you
can see they block out one of them
rather than the single power header on
the original 27t that we looked at then
for components it is micron memory on
this particular model there's no
guarantee that's on all of them there's
a controller over here which is a you
p95 one to p95 12 p
builds wait has talked about this part I
believe for the MOSFETs they are on semi
31 70s which look familiar for this
generation as well and that's for all of
them so that's where all the MOSFETs
here they're all 31 70 on semi MOSFETs
and for that we have a set of 2 4 6 8 10
of them so we're on an 8 +2 4 actually
is pretty easy to see by just the chalk
labeling to see these 47s that's going
to be your memory BRM and there's the
two-phase for that so two-phase memory
VR I'm above the screwdriver and then we
have 2 4 6 8 phase of the vcore below
the screwdriver and those are all the
same 31 70 parts other parts controllers
on the back yeah this is this is
basically a 28 EFV PCB so on the back
same parts we've seen for this
generation you p95 one two I think that
wraps up the board components so there's
really not a whole lot to this PCB that
we haven't already seen because it is
basically one we've already seen shunt
resistors if you care there's a shunt
resistor down here where you see that 5
milli ohm are zero zero five five
million resistor and there should be
another one somewhere Oh two more so
we've got three let's just figure out
what those where those go to in case
anyone wants to shunt mod their car card
not their car there are three so one's
gonna go to PCIe it's probably this one
and then the other two will go to the
power but let's just figure it out so
we're gonna take a 12 volt on six and
eight pin it's the same thing all they
add is a sense and a ground on the
eights so we're gonna take one of the
yellow pins that'll be on the inside
line of the pin out and then match that
against the shunt resistor and this is
foun our mod mad on store docking with
excess net if you think that would be
useful for you to have so let's measure
them and see which ones are continuous
that is not oh there we go wasn't
connected fully there so this is
continuous with that one so we've got
the center shunt resistor down here that
along with the red probe that is
continuous with the six pin and then
just to make sure that these obviously
aren't that when it clearly is not that
one clearly is not so there's as
suspected or not connected to that one
so the middle one goes to the six pin
and then probably the top one goes to
eight yes so top one goes to the eight
pin which you can see cuz we're getting
more or less zero ohm so it is a
continuous circuit and just to prove a
point this one open loop or open line so
that is going to be continuous with the
PCIe slot if you do short your shots
don't shunt the short the bottom shot
because you don't want to pull more
power through the PCIe slot but pulling
more through these is okay just be
careful how you do go about shorting it
so the last thing here is what's on the
die and the answer to that is it's a tu
106 - 400 a that's the important part
the a after the 400 and then a 1
the reason the a at the end of 400 is
important is because there are sort of
two sub SKUs of the r-tx 2070
there's the 400 and then the 400 a the
400 is the one we saw on the original 20
70 black edition which is the $500 card
the 400 a is going to be bend slightly
higher by Nvidia so it's a pre-sorted
GPU that's supposed to be a higher
quality piece of silicon and
theoretically therefore overclocks
higher and there's a quality difference
there there's a price difference there
and video doesn't give that to
manufacturers for free they pay a
premium for the a suffix and a one at
the end is just revision number so it's
specifically not a one what you need to
look for is 400 a or not a this one is
400 a the base frequency for this
operating in our review is about 1935
megahertz
whereas the
400 model for the 20 Saudi black it's
about 1800 megahertz so massive
difference there
part of that is power delivery part of
it is the pre-sorting of the GPU on the
XE ultra that we have here so something
that might be useful for you in buying
cards that's it for this one as always
