480 with an updated v bios and newer
silicon we figured it'd be worth
attempting to crossfire together in RS
580 and RX 480 to look at performance
this seems like a realistic scenario Rx
40s will get harder to find and prices
will soon skyrocket considering the end
of life for the RX 40 production but our
x5 ATS will live on owners may resort to
then to 580 s or crossfire I want to
make sure it all works as normally which
may or may not include negative scaling
we'll soon find out before that this
coverage is brought to you by the
Computex conference which runs from May
30th to June 3rd in Taipei Taiwan this
year Computex is the biggest event of
the year for PC hardware and technology
where we preview the newest prototypes
before they come to market
we highly recommend attending or
following this event online for industry
professionals and enthusiasts learn more
at the link in the description below so
the first order of business is to say
that yes this works you can crossfire
580 and a 480 it does not take any
special hacks the question here was
really just did and they imposed
something that said this won't work
because in terms of hardware it's the
same architecture it's still Polaris the
580 in the 480 are not different other
than the voltages and the frequency
profiles on the 580 being a bit higher
for each so that means in theory which
you can do you would be able to take the
580 put it in the first slot crossfire
it with a 480 and then you're really
only going to be bound by the slowest
card which is probably your 480 unless
you were to overclock it to match 580
which is not too hard to do so that
leaves us with the question of
scalability and how well does crossfire
do in our previous coverage of multi-gpu
whether it was crossfire or sli didn't
matter which one I I'm struggling to
recall if there was ever a scenario
where we recommended multi-gpu
from either Nvidia or from Andy pretty
sure we've never recommended that and
it's because the scaling is kind of hit
and miss so when it scales well it's
really cool it's a great way to get some
extra performance out of an older device
or an ageing device but when it doesn't
scale you're left with micro stutter and
basically forced to disable the multigp
technology whether that's SLI or
crossfire and that means more effort
involved in getting
game-2 work with the system configuring
profiles to enable a disabled crossfire
sli based on the system and the games
and it's just it's not the most trivial
scenario to work with and you do
generally lose some scaling and some of
the games that are not really optimized
for multi-gpu
so it's always been a question now
whether that remains true we'll see this
is the first crossfire test of the year
for us so we'll be testing the 580 with
the 480 we use gaming X cards for each
this is a 580 gaming X now this is a 480
gaming X this is a 580 gaming ax as you
can see they are physically identical
and we put those in crossfire enabled it
in Radeon settings and we'll give it a
go we've got power testing first and
then game testing we've got 3dmark fire
strike and pinus fight lengths in the
article in the description below if you
want to see the synthetics for the
testing we're really clock limited by
the slowest card here which is going to
be the Rx for any gaming X but both of
them are pretty decent for their
categories the 480 gaming X was not a
bad card when you look at its stock
clocks and then other notes vram doesn't
stack if you're not aware most you
probably are but with things like dx11
there's no vram stacking so we're going
to be limited to 8 gigabytes of video
memory for anything that uses DirectX 11
things that use a newer api's might do
some extra stuff with the memory they
have the capability to it's just a
matter of whether or not the developers
have added that functionality to their
particular game well start this test by
measuring total system power draw from
the wall just to get an idea of how much
more consumption that is scaling with
the multiple cards well 3d mark
firestrike extreme the crossfire rx 580
and for 80 gaming that system is drawing
460 watts on the wall for comparison the
RX for 80 game next standalone stock
system to 248 watts with the 580 socks
with met 281 the crossfire config is
drawing about 64 percent more power than
a single 580 gaming X or about 85% more
power than the single R X 480 gaming
acts with for honor our system power
draw is that around 426 watts load
that's the highest on the chart so far
the profile with this game has some
power management issues judging by
fluctuations on a meter and by
interion at 1440p and 4k there's fierce
micro stutter at 4k regardless our power
draw is about 37 percent more than the
rx 580 gaming Xbox system which draws
310 watts and we're about 54 percent
higher in power draws on the our X 480
stock GPU idle power draw isn't really
affected in a meaningful way here
because this crossfire doesn't really do
anything when you're on desktop or
windowed mode we've got a couple extra
watts for the LEDs and polling but
crossfire doesn't engage on the desktop
so we're looking at around 80 watts idle
wall draw I stated you can check the
article below for 3d mark tests now
let's move on to gaming we're starting
with Mass Effect Andromeda for crossfire
is big challenge with Mass Effect
Andromeda and that seems to be
overlooked when considering multi-gpu
despite folks proclaiming Andromeda's
multigp support there's been limited
discussion around the reason why it's
sort of cheating there's an option that
enables by default when going multi-gpu
and it lowers graphics settings to
reduce micro stuttering and improve aim
rates the game doesn't actually tell you
which settings it's lower in live while
it does it it just sort of does it and
that means that benchmarking in
performance mode for multi GPU does not
produce comparable numbers to the single
card benchmarks since those tests will
be more intensive we've actually got a
few screenshots of performance mode
versus quality mode that we can show on
the screen and that's for multi-gpu
quality mode produces the same image
quality as a single card so the graphics
actually look the same frame by frame
but there's intense micro stutter at
higher resolutions and just kind of bad
frame rates even at 1080p so it's not a
good experience if you were to enable
performance mode as you can see in the
screenshots the differences between the
two show that performance has a lower
quality primarily in places like ambient
occlusion local reflections and some
changes to depth shading and refractions
you can kind of look at the shiny
surfaces and see that the quality of the
reflections in those services is reduced
and the ambient occlusion in places like
door frames and ceilings is reduced as
well with performance mode so again the
difficulty here is that they are not
linear comparisons if you're running
performance mode versus a whole bunch of
cards that were single GPU running the
particular set up so it's kind of
cheating to use performance mode but
we'll put both numbers in the charts
anyway just so that everyone can
understand the issues and where things
fall 4k doesn't look good for quality
mode we're experiencing intense game
breaking micro stutter that doesn't even
show up in the already dismal framerate
numbers we're at 19 FPS average behind
both the single rx 480 and single rx 580
this is the first time we've seen
negative scaling in a game and it's
really pronounced here you'd be way
better off to say when crossfire in this
case but let's move on to 1440p ensure
both performance and quality mode
numbers quality mode produces the same
at quality frames as every other card
and puts us at 38 FPS average the worst
on the chart behind even the RX 470
there is intense negative scaling with
crossfire in this title at least until
we switch on performance mode which
again cheats the graphics to be a bit
lower the game at now peg is a 580 and
480 crossfire configuration at 54 FPS
average tied with an overclocked rx 580
single card configuration we're ahead of
the RX 580 gaming X single GPU stock by
about 1 to 2 FPS even with this mode
you're far better off disabling the
particular cross fire configuration
we're running and using a single card
instead because one your graphics
quality will be better and to the
framerate will be mostly equivalent at
best we're seeing three percent scaling
an average FPS 1080p looks about the
same for quality mode plant in the
crossfire config below the RX 470 and
average frame rates and far below it in
frame time consistency scaling is
negative here and it's negative in a big
way 29% switching to performance mode
puts us at 100 FPS average with one
prism lose at 69 and 0.1% at 56
that's finally showing some real scaling
over single 580 gaming X which operated
a seventy eight point seven FPS average
but again the single card was under
heavier workload so it's debatable how
much you can really count that as a true
scaling result if the image quality is
not identical between configs
for honor is another game that has some
interesting challenges crossfire
performs better for us at lower
resolutions of this game like 1440 p.m.
1080p and did a bit worse in 4k with 4k
we saw fierce micro stuttering that
would necessitate disabling crossfire or
lowering resolution
as it was utterly unplayable despite not
showing up as much in benchmark numbers
we'll skip the 4k results for that
reason moving instead to a more playable
1440p we're getting seventy-nine FPS
average with 71 and 68 fps low is on the
mixed crossfire configuration showing
positive scaling over the single rx 580
gaming X the performance gain is about
32 percent with an insignificant amount
of teryan as a side effect not bad
scaling it over a single rx 480 is about
39 percent this puts the configuration
between the 980ti and the 1070 reference
card at 1080p scaling is again positive
with a 120 FPS average throughput and
lows at or above 100 FPS the arts 580
gaming X single card performs around 93
FPS average showing that the mixed
crossfire card scale over a single 580
gaming X by about 29% we're still below
a 1070 reference card here Doom is up
next on the list using Vulcan as the API
of choice Vulcan just like OpenGL has
never really delivered for multi-gpu
users in Doom we're not seeing any
scaling here at 4k as we can highlight
on the screen the 580 and crossfire
configuration are basically the same
that carries over to 1440p where there's
slight overhead without any scaling to
speak of at least in a positive way
crossfire devices even if you were to
use the exact same device just don't
scale in this game 1080p is no different
as will briefly show here there's slight
overhead in the worst case or just
equality in the best case Ghost Recon
wildlands is a bit worse than lack of
scaling we just couldn't even get the
benchmark to start with this one the
game hard crashed at all resolutions
with our very high test settings and
Ghost Recon wildlands running it earns
the crossfire rx 580 and 480 a solid DNF
they did not finish any of the tests
with this game Sniper Elite offers some
redemption though had 4k with the x12
and async compute enabled we're seeing
the crossfire rx 580 and 40 gaming X
cards placed at 79 FPS average with lows
at 63 and 65 80 gaming a single card
operated at about 40 FPS average with
lows it linearly lower than the
crossfire config at scaling of nearly 2x
we almost never see that in games Sniper
Elite is one of the very few titles that
can make a case for multi GPU
but it is surrounded by a games market
that is otherwise mixed in multigp
readiness the 79 FPS average of our
mixed crossfire configuration plants the
cards ahead of a reference 1080 and
about 8% behind the 1080 TI gaming acts
and that's impressive performance to say
the least it's rare but impressive in
this instance of sniper leaves for
unfortunately it's not just a low-level
API thing we didn't see any scaling with
Vulcan so that's out nash's of the
singularity posted about a 46.5% scaling
as you can see in this 4k high test
chart so nothing special to speak of
there so the short of this is you could
crossfire a 580 with the 480 it's not
can you probably don't even have to
flash the BIOS on the 480 to get it up
to a 580 it just will work so that's
nice if you wanted to do it you could do
it now as far as recommending it this is
still not something we recommend we've
never recommended crossfire we've never
recommended SLI at least not for gaming
it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
Sniper Elite is a fantastic fringe case
if you wanted to hold something high and
say look at how great multi GPU is you
would choose that game to push the
narrative because it looks amazing 100
percent scaling is unheard of for the
most part in our testing at least
so yes it's happened before it's
happening it's like relief or this isn't
a common thing as you can see what the
other games here if you were to play the
games on this bench as you're kind of
monthly suite of games that you play
around with you'd be basically
configuring profiles for each one where
Ghost Recon you turn it off for honor
you turn it off if you're at 4k maybe
leave it on if you have 1080 or
something like that
sniper leaf or absolutely leave it on
but then you look at some other games
the x11 titles particularly which
there's still a lot of those scaling is
mixed it's either maybe equal sometimes
there's negative scaling the division
showed negative scaling last time we
tested crossfire and SLI so this is not
something we necessarily recommend is
the point but it works and when it works
well it's actually really cool so if
you're actually considering that's what
you need to look at more is what games
am I playing and then if we haven't
tested it go find a crossfire benchmark
for that game and see if it actually
scales because if it doesn't and you
only play
a few games it's a huge waste of money
you'd be better off using a single card
avoiding the headaches and waiting for
either Vega or just getting something
like a 1070 although that's kind of a
weird upgrade but you get the idea
basically you're better off with a
single GPU that's more powerful as has
pretty much always been the case for
gaming at least in the last few years
then going with multi-gpu
even if you already own one of the cards
unless you have a specific game that you
play that scales well otherwise look
toward Vega or look towards something
like a 1080 or something similar to that
that's going to be more powerful than a
single one of these cards so that's all
