had to review and these are active eiga
56 their direct competition to the gtx
1070 by nvidia the busy six is a $400
card we're looking at it from a lot of
angles today including under volt in
overclocking BIOS modding HBM vs core
overclocking and we'll try to get into
thermals power consumption and gaming
performance though some of that may have
to be saved for a separate video because
we're about nine hours away from embargo
lip before getting to that this video is
brought to you by synergy the software
that lets you share a keyboard and mouse
between multiple systems if you have
limited desk space and multiple
computers to command that synergy
removes the need for separate
peripherals or a KVM and works as over
the network software use our link below
to get 50% off the basic or pro version
we won't be going over any of the very
basics today if you need pricing
information specs things like that check
the article below or check other content
creation outlets we're focusing on data
because that's what we have time to do
so first off overclocking notes on it
and issues we encountered Vega 56 was
very exciting to us when it was first
announced specifically because as a $400
card with these specifications it
carried and with what we knew about EFI
56 looks like it could overclock to
outperform a Vega 64 card or at least
perform equally if you know what you're
doing or even if you don't you just kind
of hack at it but we were let down or if
you know builds IDE we wanted to set
forth turn Vega 56 into effectively a
Vega 64 says the CU difference really
would become less significant as
frequency increases we quickly found
that 56 is limited to 300 watts of power
by bios that is a hard limit despite the
fact that the vrm can easily handle more
it is after all the very same vrm as on
vfe and vega 64 the core and the vrm can
handle the wattage but we're not given
the allowance stock 300 amps really
shouldn't be a problem 360 watts
shouldn't be a problem but we're stuck
at 300 so what's the solution
well you flash bios that's not only the
way it's done fortunately these cards
the ante reference ones do have a dual
BIOS switch so there's really no risk in
doing it as long as you don't flash both
in flashing bios using the newest
version of ati flash which is Vega
compatible we
found that there is a security block on
the bios that prevents any kind of
modifications to bios and that includes
changing things like the name of it so
what we ran into was a successful flash
it applied correctly rebooting you get a
black screen at no display
initialization and an error code on the
motherboard that indicates as such so to
fix this you boot back in you flash back
and you're good to go
unfortunately this is because of an
these security features that they've
added with Vega and AMD tells us that
they are to comply with the secure boot
protocol set forth by Microsoft and
other vendors unfortunately that
protocol does in friends on enthusiasts
demand to be able to play with the video
card but that's not seems to be taking
the backseat here as has been the case
lately so this was a big letdown to both
build lloyd and myself we were really
hoping for a lot more out of AMD a
company which traditionally has
advocated openness and permitted whether
explicitly or not some level of modding
that their competitors don't necessarily
permit at least not at the same level
after rolling back we next tried a
registry hack this registry hack works
with a Vega frontier edition to the
point where you can push 400 watts
through it if you want to so it's known
to work it's just that it's a power
table tack you install it you're good to
go with Vega 56 the power tables mod
available for efi doesn't work at all so
either a new one needs to be written or
it's just not going to work we think
that it might be possible at some point
but today is not that point so the
registry mod that works for this does
not work for 56 and the BIOS flashing
works but you can't change it so there's
no getting around to that 300 watt limit
which means that as you'll see later in
the performance section there's a whole
lot of performance left on the table for
Vegas 56 because there's just no
overclocking Headroom which is a power
choke moving on here we also proved the
HBM voltage so HBM to voltage looking at
it with a DMM we found it to be 1.3
volts it's a little bit lower than our
VF e this partly contributes to the
lower achievable HBM to clock on Vega 56
as it's not getting as much voltage B
core now maxes out at 1.2 volts as well
rather than 1.25 volts on VF
furthering the overclocking limitations
on Vega 56 anyway despite being
disappointingly limited in overclock and
we can still use Vega 56 to prototype a
few veins under volting is one of them
and then we can play around with the
overclocking or HBM 2 vs cores login' is
what we're about to do in this content a
couple of notes here overclocking Vega
just like with Fe has a lot of bugs
along with it and the acknowledges these
at least openly to the media and if you
want to overclock as well you're going
to have to keep an eye out for some of
these although in two weeks once this
thing comes out hopefully they're
resolved but 64 buyers will need to keep
an eye out for things like misreported
frequency and misreported voltage where
occasionally the voltage readout in watt
man and I'm not sure about other tools
but wot man especially will not match
what you should see if you probe the
back the card and also frequency will
sometimes report things like 12 50
megahertz while still performing at 1600
megahertz levels of performance ie
1070 levels despite reading about 4 300
400 megahertz lower let's call it 300 to
be more accurate so those are items of
note for overclocking a lot of the
software is wrong don't trust it just do
the overclock run a quick fire strike
test if the score improves great if it
doesn't there's a problem and that's the
best way to validate this right now not
by looking at clocks as you OC let's
start off with HB m2 versus core clock
overclocking the behavioral outcome of
HB m to burst core clock is going to
change based on the application and the
card so these results will not apply
evenly across all gaming card some are
more memory intensive than others but
this is just kind of a quick look at
things fire strike 1080p graphics
scoring increments as we overclock the
card stock we're at 18 8 1 6 points for
an average FPS of 90 and gt1 increasing
power targets by 50% boosts up to 21 188
no other changes so just power offset
now our power consumption goes from
about 196 watts to about 300 watts at
the PCIe rail that's not the total
system draw that's PCIe cable output
talk more about power in a moment though
anyway that's a gain of about twelve
point six percent in this benchmark from
the power target offset it's not linear
to all games of course but it is
significant here if we overclock HB m2
and offset the power
our target we have about 3.6 percent
boosted at nine fifty megahertz HP m2
over just the power darken offset it's
not a bad game from HP m2 only
overclocking to nine 80 megahertz HB m2
with a 10% offset on core because manual
input didn't work with these percentages
for the most part that boosts us to six
point four percent over the power offset
with no HBM to overclock or nearly
nineteen point six percent over stock
the memory overclock and power offset
alone get us 19.2% overstock and the
power offset gets us twelve point six
percent over stock the takeaway here is
that first of all power target offset
does a whole lot for you and
unfortunately it increases power but we
have a solution to that it's under volt
and we'll get there aside from this the
next takeaway HBM to overclocking in our
quick testing appears to be more
relevant for performance than core
overclocking if you had to pick one pick
HP m to push it as high as you can and
roll forth without noticing much of a
loss we were at a couple percentage
points max from overclocking the core
alongside HBM 2 so that's the main
takeaway and a lot of this limitations
the reason we stopped where we do is
because we're starved for power you can
tell this by just looking at the current
clamp while it's drawing
never goes over 300 watts so we're
clearly starved and this is a BIOS limit
it's unfortunate that it's there but
hopefully AV partners will have some
flexibility to do custom BIOS or in the
very least remove some of those security
features although that seems unlikely so
that you can push it further if you
wanted to because the card is capable of
more it's got a great vrm in it this is
one of the best reference cards that
we've ever seen and yet we can't really
tap into the full potential of the vrm
so that's unfortunate anyway the
overclocking was disappointing let's try
the opposite let's undervolt it here's a
chart showing Vega 56 power as measured
at the PCIe tables of the current clamp
running twelve point three volts an
absolute stock configuration and during
a half-hour burnin with fire strike the
V 56 consumes on average about 180 watts
of the PCIe tables not accounting for
the other 28 watts or saw the PCIe slot
which is responsible for fan power at
2.4 amps and 12 volts here's what the
power draw looks like when we increase
the offset by 50% remember earlier we
saw that increasing power target alone
could stabilize clock and improve
upwards of 12% and fire strike when
comparing to the stock config of course
doing this also increases power and
lands us at 270 watts sustained power
consumption at the cables rather than
nearly 100 about a 100 watts lower
here's where it gets interesting when
under volting we managed to stabilize at
10 25 millivolts with DPM states 6 and 7
set to 1652 megahertz digging out here
this is the clock output as we see it in
software the real clock output is about
15 24 megahertz so you have to put in a
higher number than you receive because
AMD now has a dynamic clock anyway we've
dropped from 1200 millivolts to 1025
that's huge
the increase in power target of 50%
along with this increases the speed
overall in frequency and the result is
clear the first 300 seconds or so that
you see it going crazy is when we were
trying to work with an these software
issues at which point we gave up on watt
man and resorted to watt tool which is a
fantastic solution for getting this type
of work done doing this made under
volting to work and as we see when the
line levels out around 210 watts
we overall reduce power from the 50%
offset at a slight increase over the
baseline note also that the line is
nearly perfectly flat now meaning that
we've controlled from fluctuations in
power delivery and clock frequency
results has smoothed out performance on
the whole while drawing 55 watts less
power than the offset V 56 but 30 watts
more than the stock card ultimately we
get away with better performance let's
look at a frequency chart next check
this out we're at higher clocks than
just the 50 percent offset 1524 mega
study as a sniper versus 14 75 mega
Hertz the stock card reports 1300
megahertz here resulting in a 224 mega
Hertz boost for 30 watts more power not
a bad trade at all there's plenty of
more room to play to if you were to get
serious about it we kind of cut it off
here and called it a day for now big
note there's a bit of reporting bug with
Vega right now sometimes the frequencies
look a bit funny it's always the same
level of funny though seems to be an
accurate miss reporting in software so
when you're looking at frequencies it's
kind of like if you were to take k-type
thermocouple do you have a known range
of variants maybe 2.2 Salty's or
something like that but that
thermocouple is always that same amount
of measurements off it's always 1
Celsius off always in the same direction
so it's kind of like that here where the
frequency appears to be oddly read out
in the same fashion across all tests so
in the very least it's accurate in that
regard although we don't know the true
frequency because of AMD's new way
they've set a Vega and the way they've
set up the software it's hard to know
but we did talk to them at length about
this finally here's a look at the
temperatures the fan was left alone for
all these tests so there's obviously
maneuverability for users willing to
speed up or slow down on the fan with
v56 that 50% off set we're at 84 Celsius
by the end of the test quite warm the
stock card and under-voltage card both
fluctuated around the study for 275 see
mark under bolting gave us more clock
speed a middle-of-the-road power metric
and didn't impact their most negatively
that's a big improvement more or less
across the board power is not so bad
either just as a very quick aside here's
a PWM to noise response chard we're at
about the same noise level versus vfe
within variance anyway as it's the same
cooler nothing new to discuss here
our auto speed on be 56 times V 44% rpm
which outputs about 48.8 DBA and that's
when you're in heavier operation the fan
will sometimes sit closer to 40%
technically 39 for lighter workloads
which is about 45.8 DBA
certainly neither quiet nor efficient as
it is a blower fan the coolers just not
very good but that's always been the
case for these types of designs we
really have to look out for AIB partner
cards later to look for something with
improved cooling that says the vrm is
good so maybe a good h2o candidate if
you want to dodge the bullet of the AIB
partner cards where you pay for
something they're not going to use
anyway there was much talk of power
consumption earlier here's a comparative
chart showing idle power consumption at
the wall again at the wall not at the
rail so we switched how we're measuring
from earlier wall draw the total system
operates at 76 watts with Vega 56 which
places it and here it's RX 580
predecessor the gtx 1070 fe operates at
67 watts idle or 12% lower Ghost Recon
wildlands provides a gaming workload
that places the Vega 56 at 332 watts
power draw adjacent to our 10 ATT is e2
and just past the rx 580
org lock systems again systems here the
gtx 1070 system has about 27 percent
lower power consumption than the RX they
got 56 system the overclocked 1070
consumes about 283 watts for the total
system for honor shows power consumption
at 313 watts for Vega 56 with the GTX
970 EFI stock at 232 or 26% lower power
consumption finally 3dmark fire strike
puts us at 303 watt system draw with the
gtx 1070 efi at 212 watt system draw
again that's the difference of about 30%
the RX 580 operates about the same here
once we've overclocked it and Vega efi
system both 381 watts note that because
of timing for filming this review and
running tests there may be some
additional Vega numbers or other numbers
on these charts that aren't verbally
mentioned they'll be there but we're
kind of running a lot of tests alongside
filming the video next some brief
discussion on thermal starting off with
a look back at Vega from to your Edition
including our hybrid mods and 40 DB a
noise normalize testing the Vega 56 card
runs a GPU core temperature of about 74
to 75 see under stock conditions this
requires a 38 to 44 percent fan speed
depending on how the application
enumerates the clock and impacts the via
rams and things like that
GPU temperature is therefore lower than
VF e is stock but not all that much it's
about what you'd expect given that the
same cooler in a different GPU just
slightly fan PWM to RPM response isn't
too different here either
the MOSFETs also measures similarly for
the right side of hot spot where we
observe a 63 C measurements on the Vegas
56 card this is completely within reason
for a video card and for vrm and can
even be run without a baseplate or VR on
fan at all why not the best but we've
tested it and you can actually do it at
least on vfe so no trouble there
measuring the backside hot spot on the
PCV if hosing the top inductors the V 56
card reports a 65 cells is for the PCB
rear temperature we remove the backplate
later and saw that it improved thermals
in this department by about 3 to 5
Celsius as the backplate is acting like
a heat trap and preventing heat from
escaping adequately Andy could probably
ventilate this better in the future but
it's a reference card so what are you
going to do for a comparison to the 1070
F II here's a look at a 3 mark burnin
for half an hour the Titans have any
system draw
about 250 watts at the wall during the
burn with the RX Vega system drawing
about 300 watts at the wall or about 20%
more thermally the 1070 prefers to run a
higher core temperature of 78 79 Celsius
in favor of a lowered noise level with
its fan operating at 53% and 42 DBA
output the RX Vega 56 reference card
prefers to stabilize at 74 to 75 C but
it's been operating louder 44% and 48
DBA I noticed will stop a bit noise but
slightly cooler there's room here to
decrease noise and increased temperature
if you wanted to but really make more
sense to go with a partner cooler
instead at that point let's get the
gaming we're not going to have every
single game test with under Bolton we're
not gonna have overclock and results on
here just yet before people start crying
and saying Steve why don't you
manipulate the space-time continuum and
make it so that there's enough time to
do everything in 27 hours that you've
had the card we're working on it this
this review has a lot of stuff in it
already especially given the
circumstances so work with me here this
is the initial data we have 1070 and v56
performance stock some overclocked
numbers and they're not too many and
we'll look into it more but let's just
kind of hold off on to firmly drawing
conclusions just yet especially with the
bike lock modifications and things like
that that are forthcoming but this will
give you a first look in the very least
oh and as a note we did work on under
volting pins and testing them in games
but it's really buggy it sometimes will
go down only three amps instead of six
amps and sometimes it goes down the full
6 amps and sometimes it doesn't go down
at all in power consumption so it's
really hard to know when under volt
things are actually working and we
haven't figured out what causes it to
break yet anyway started with Ghost
Recon at 4k the RX Vega 56 performs at
32 FPS average lows at 29 and 28 the gtx
1070 reference card and FC cards both
stood at around 35 FPS average setting
Vega to a plus 50% power target gets it
to 39 and overclocked in 1070 SC ties it
with Vega at this point these are within
variance and are effectively equal
there's not a so-called Victor in a 0.3
fps difference they're the same at 1440p
the RX Vega 56 card operate
- the so not because average placing it
behind the 1070 reference card by 7.6%
or behind the SC by 8.8%
overclocking the SC lands it at 68 FPS
with Vega 56 adjacent when set to plus
50% power targets for about 65 FPS
average overclocking HP m2 and the core
will help here further in theory that
will test that more soon in this
configuration we're measuring 25 amps or
300 watts at the PCIe cables on the V 56
at 1080p the v56 operates at 74 FPS
average or 84 FPS when set to the plus
50% power target the gtx 1070 runs in 83
FPS average stock 85 FPS for an AI BSC
and 90 FPS when overclocking let's see
we're ghost recon tends to show an
Nvidia Advantage sniper attempts to show
an AMD advantage so it goes the world of
games or everyone optimizes differently
at 4k v 56 operates an average FPS of 53
followed by the overclocked 1070 SC also
have 53 FPS average though with
marginally less consistent frame times
the gtx 1070 SC at 49 fps is 8% behind
here with the reverence 1070 at under 50
FPS at this point note also that vega
frontier edition comes off working
pretty poor in the scenario given its
tied performance with v56 we're all
we've been told by rob of tech gauge
check them out
friend of a site the vega 64 and 56
cards that still possess decent
professional performance actually very
good in the 64 instance in some cases
and sort of makes BFE look even odder in
our opinion that it already did but
check the review out for more on
workstation stuff ashes of the
singularity and dx12 runs v56 at 67 FPS
average with the GTX 970 SC trailing 5%
behind at 63 FPS reverence card operates
a 61 FPS average overclocking levels
things out that we haven't fully
overclocked b56 es so Andy still has
some room there to booth beyond the 1070
SC check back hopefully this week for
more of that with for honor at 4k the V
56 runs 38 FPS average against 210 Sony
reference cards 41 FPS arrad Vega FPS
it's at 40 FPS average in this title for
reference at 1440p the v56 run 7% behind
the reference 1070 or 9% behind the SC
frame rates here are in the 70s for Vega
56 with
ten 70s stretching to the low 80s 1080p
illustrates the gap with most of the GTX
170 F EE at 123 FPS average versus one
11 of the b56
SC operates at 127 FPS average so these
are 11 to 14 percent I had in this title
but to any strong gain there will be
countered by doom-doom at 4k post v 56
at 61 FPS average with the 1070 SC at 54
like sniper Andy tends to receive favor
in doom from Vulcan
which is what we're seeing here the lead
over the 1070 SC is about 13% in this
particular title countering the last one
for NVIDIA for one of the more
remarkable boosts over the tens only
baseline finally we just added
hell-blade to our bench so it presently
only has a 1070 SC and vc6 on the charts
4k yields about 30 fps or both sets of
devices so skip that at 1440p in very
high hell-blade positions with 1070 SC
at 57 FPS average and the Vega 56 is
sort of nearby and before anyone cries
that the reverence 1070 isn't down here
yes yes we're aware no we can't
manipulate time and space there's more
work to be done we know but the limited
time and be provided for this bench
means that for now this is where it
stands so that's it for now
this was a lot of work already we had
like I said something like 27 hours to
do it all and there's plenty more to be
done this is a fairly conclusive review
in some aspects thermals and power but
there's a lot more to learn in gaming
check out other sites as always to pick
up multiple sources of information
because everyone's gonna be looking at
different stuff right now because we all
had no time most people had one two
three days and this was sandwiched
between thread Ripper components so it's
an interesting choice by Andy to decide
to launch Vega right after one of their
biggest cpu launches of the year of the
decade and give everyone two to four
days to work on Vega not sure why they
did that but that's why you're going to
see a lot of reviews today that are
probably going to be along the lines of
here's the data I've collected so far
we're going to have to look more head to
it to really make conclusions which is
basically what I'm saying here so we've
got conclusions on something's power
clearly v56
cause Moore's anywhere from twenty to
thirty sometimes a bit more twenty to
thirty percent more power in the same
scenario as the GTX 970 in game that
kind of plus or minus eight percent
depending on what game you tested the
Nvidia gave the games that tend to favor
Nvidia and the AMD games at the games
that tend to favor a and B we're showing
basically opposite results so you get
wan words plus 13% Nvidia and one words
plus 13% AMD just depends on what you're
playing you really need to look into the
games that you play figure out which
ones fit those metrics and that kind of
dictates your card to some extent and
then the biggest thing here is mining so
this is the other reason why I hesitate
to do any kind of really firm conclusion
right now we have no idea what these
cards will be priced at hours after
release so we're told $400 is MSRP just
like we're told from Nvidia that they're
10 70 MSRP is what but 400 or 380 or
something like that so we're somewhere
around there but it's clearly not
available at that price most the other
cars on the market aren't available at
MSRP so we'll see how long it lasts if
at all for V 56 and then at that point
it's not a question of who's MSRP is
lower it's a question of who's available
price is lower so it's way too hard to
tell definitively which card makes the
most sense right now without seeing how
the prices land but you've got the
numbers so that gives you some
preliminary information to think about
and then from there hopefully stay on
top of coverage and maybe watch the
prices here where they fall so that's
all for this time check back for more
subscribe for additional coverage on
this card and I think it's 3 a.m. so
I've got about 4 hours of editing
writing and uploading to go so hopefully
this will make it online at embargo
