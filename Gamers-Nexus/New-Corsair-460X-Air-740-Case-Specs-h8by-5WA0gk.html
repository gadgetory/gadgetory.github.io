West 2016 they have two new cases that
were announced this morning one of them
is this one next to me this is the air
740 before getting to that this coverage
is brought to you by a higher power and
the new elements gaming PC which
coincidentally has a large tempered
glass side window as you'll see in the
b-roll
you may remember the air 540 this is a
new version so it's still got the
compartmentalize chambers left chamber
is kind of your main components
motherboard GQ all that stuff right
chamber is the PSU the drives I believe
it now supports three drives towards me
and then it's got some rotate rotation
support for SSDs if you want to change
their orientation within the backside
mountain terms of the main side main
compartment setup
there's expanded radiator support so
they've got a 280 radiator in the bottom
280 on the top and 360 in the front
that's a set up here today so that's the
maximum radio radiator support on the
air 740 stock fans it comes with three
fans the front stock but these are not
the units that it shipped with the case
these are actually maglev fans which
ports are sells separately to be saw
them I believe at Computex or CES the
other case that we were looking at here
today is that the 460 X not to be
confused with them these are X 460 so
the 460 X is a similar case to the 400 C
but it has new tooling so it does have
completely new tooling in terms of what
you're getting it's really almost the
same as the 400 C in terms of your
ability to build within the case
features all that stuff except a few new
things one of them there's three
switches on the top of the case that has
kind of a dummy fan controller you can
control the LEDs it does seven speeds
seven LED colors and it includes
optionally three front SP 120 RGB fans
that's one configuration that cost $140
the other configuration of the 460 X in
three of the same fans of snow are
jeebies and that is 120 dollars so the
the 460 X is that case it's got tempered
glass in the left side and in the front
and it's four millimeter thick tempered
glass which if you're not familiar with
the current trends in the industry
that's about standard for the tempered
glass panel and in size we saw that a
lot of cases in coffee tax including the
Cullinan so that's a 460 X this one is
150
that one's 120 or 140 depending on your
options and the fans are really the
differentiating factor as far as these
main selling point for the 460 X it's a
tempered glass and solid point for this
same as the air 540 it's
compartmentalization of your computer
components with a focus on airflow from
the front as intake so that's what
coursers got here at the show everything
else we've seen coolers the
hydrographics of course is here we
covered that extensively check the
channel for more on that hey Charlie the
promotional video helps out directly and
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
