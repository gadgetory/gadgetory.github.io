testing we're looking at the point at
which a GPU can exceed the bandwidth
limitations of PCIe gen3 slots
particularly when in by eight or by
sixteen modes this comparison includes
dual Titan V's testing and by eight and
by sixteen configurations pushing the
limits of the one gigabyte per second
per Lane bandwidth restriction of the
PCIe slots we bought the first Titan v
then YouTube channel bit speed trip and
said to us the second one and we're now
able to spread more load between two
PCIe slots than we could before before
getting to those this coverage is
brought to you by EVGA and their 10 ATT
is c2 which we've recommended fairly
highly for its build quality and the icx
sensors which are kind of fun to play
with you can check our full sc2 review
for the 1080i if you're curious to learn
more or you can click the link in the
description below to find the product
page for the 1080i sc2 so the last time
we did this test was on 1080 ice and we
only did a single card with a single
card in one slot between x16 and x8 we
saw no more than generally a 1%
difference between the two not that
exciting basically the same we now have
Titan V's which are considerably more
powerful in certain applications that
can leverage them and we also have to
Titan V's so we can really only leverage
this in one application right now and
that's ashes of the singularity as far
as games go now there are other
applications like GPU PI where you can
leverage them in tandem but it's not
quite the same workload PCIe bandwidth
consumption is going to very heavily on
what's being used to test it for example
the folks who do GPU mining often extend
their cards via a riser cable to a by
one or by four slot generally by one if
you're doing that you can tell already
that that particular mining application
doesn't really care about the bandwidth
of the PCIe bus so it will depend
- is tends to care as we've seen in the
past
Asha's also supports explicit multi-gpu
via DirectX 12 and that means we can use
two cards without a bridge between them
and have them each on the slots and they
will commute
via the PCIe bus rather than an external
bridge this puts more load on that PCIe
bus and between two cards of this power
class we would expect that it might
start hitting bandwidth limitations for
really the first time we've seen almost
ever on PCIe gen3 with two cards so
that's what we're testing today together
I don't have to speed on the PCIe specs
versions four and five have been
fast-tracked but aren't here yet and
won't be for any reasonable period of
time the PCIe gen 2 did about 500
megabytes per second per Lane Gen 3 does
about 980 5 megabytes per second per
Lane so we'll call that 1 gigabyte and
Gen 4 will do one point nine seven
gigabytes per second per lanes or call
it two gigabytes so again previously no
more really than a 1% difference with
this type of test but now we're looking
at how our performs here unfortunately
again really only one game works for
this we tried several so we tried total
war Warhammer DirectX 12 with all the
different eight betas that it has and
that does support explicit multi-gpu but
it will not detect both Titan V's and
let them run without a bridge we also
tried hitman and Deus Ex mankind divided
both of which are explicit multigp ready
neither of which saw both Titan V's and
we do the same for rise of the Tomb
Raider which is not a particularly great
benchmark title to begin with but that's
fine because it also did not see two
Titan V's so we were lots of dashes and
potentially synthetics further on this
point there's a potential limitation in
that if you wanted to bridge these you'd
have to use env link a lot of you asked
in our teardown hey what's that
connector at the top of the card that
doesn't look like ass alive fingers
you're right it's env link it's a
different protocol that Nvidia put out
not too long ago about a year ago and
has greater bandwidth if you want an NV
link bridge it's $600 and we're not even
sure if it's supported on this card
right now because we don't have one
because it's $600 so we're testing two
of these explicit multi-gpu in ashes
let's go through the numbers starting
first with our dual of versus a single
Titan B benchmark we can
look at this more of an SLI versus
single card test for starters I got two
and one
we overclocked the cards equivalently in
each setup then tested with 16 PCIe
lanes available the cards tested at 63
FPS average for the dual configuration
with lows at 25 and 22 for one percent
endpoint 1% low frames I miss
respectively the single Titan V
configuration operated at 37 point 6 FPS
average immediately establishing that we
are seeing at large noteworthy gains
unfortunately ash's is where they
stopped as we were unable to get the
other games to detect both cards the
stock cards compared at 33 FPS average
versus 57 FPS average which is a
noteworthy gain of 72% either way we're
already seeing at least 68 percent gains
from adding a second card which is
significant and no the Titan V is not a
gaming card and you shouldn't do this
and it's not a gaming architecture but
it's still scaling in games and that
gives us the grounds to test whether the
PCIe differences will scale moving on
then to the PCIe bandwidth limitation
testing our charts now focus on by 16
and by 8 configurations both overclocked
to push the limits of the PCIe clock as
it transacts between two devices we're
measuring 63 FPS average for two cards
with an X 16 interface and measuring 56
FPS average for two cards with an X 8
interface that's about a 12 to 13
percent performance improvement with
PCIe gen3 by 16 and is significant in
illustrating that we're nearing the end
of Gen threes bandwidth which is 15.75
gigabytes per second for 16 lanes PCIe
gen 4 will push about 2 gigabytes per
second per Lane and will resolve any
potential issues with these cards but
NVIDIA is also using again it's $600 and
be linked bridge to solve for this
except not in games but in real
applications that are intended for the
card as for single cards we did not
notice any appreciable differences
between the single Titan v
configurations and by 8 versus the
single Titan V and by 16 it appears that
we start encountering the most issues
when transacting across new cards in
explicit multi-gpu the question becomes
whether or not you'd notice this in
other applications not every application
cares about PCIe bandwidth my name is a
great
again or GPU miners used by once lots
for all their work it's possible that
application is more tailored for the
Titan V would not run into this issue as
the two cards may not even need to talk
to each other like they deal with this
game if you use these types of devices
for their intended scientific purposes
please let us know and we can do more
bandwidth testing just let us know what
application do you use because we're not
experts in that area and that would give
us a good starting point
the takeaway then is that this is really
interesting information we're getting
data that shows that finally after a
couple of years of writing this test
every time a new high-end card comes out
we're seeing some performance Delta when
it comes to two of these transacting
across the bus it's one game that's not
representative of the whole but for
purposes of our audience gaming looking
at a next-gen architecture Volta we can
see that it's starting to approach the
limitations of PCIe gen3 now how much
that matters will largely be determined
based on what Nvidia does with this card
in its gaming cards in the future
because Volta as it stands today is
probably not going to make it into the
next 1180 or whatever they call it so
we'll see how that changes things and
see if it stays the same but for now it
looks like we're actually approaching
those limitations which is pretty cool
because we haven't been able to say that
before 12% difference is a big one

slash mod matte to preorder this mod
matte or catch our upcoming recap of the
