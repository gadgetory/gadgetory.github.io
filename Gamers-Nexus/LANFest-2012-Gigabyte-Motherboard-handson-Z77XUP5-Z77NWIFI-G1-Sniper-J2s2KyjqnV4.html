and we're here with Irene and she's
going to tell us about some of the
motherboards that we have on display
here gigabyte very well known for their
motherboards as well as graphics charts
so I read and tell us what are some of
the motherboards that you're going to be
showing us today um we actually very
happy to hear the details in frontiers
and we didn't bring our new game
experience my report here that showing
lg1 cuter series motherboard which that
we always have I to the camera that we
have sniper 3 has the album embedded
they work hard and be honest all kinds
bother you so that's a different game I
want to consume this country the whole
way is on customer it's for way for
we're so like cross for example yeah
this is the way I saw very cool very
beautiful color contrast especially that
we have the installment of embedded to
the motherboards well it's pretty
impressive to another conversion and we
also have the sniper entry that we
introduced to a gamer with a small form
factor which is my poetics the reason
why do we do in education are gamers
fishery come to a party they want to
have this more portable system that
easier to carry around so that's reason
why we introduce this Manipur it also
has a community capacity to take the to
it as a wise man firing so it's pretty
much I'm accommodate most of getting
used for a work phone very good show me
English to the 95 and this bitch working
at once useful here is an emo 2005 March
and we just equipment to our new fresh
pond over at this one is the new
excellently night as you beeline and
this is the random that you compose the
Wi-Fi cars walk away at the special
thing that I want to highlight for this
new fresh we add the sandstone
entertainer it's all connected yeah so
there's a soft commenter on about here
so this is the thing that we have been
racing for our first introduce our
excellent connectors to the market but
now that we have that I'll put it back
and also use your phone finder will just
mention to the system figures accidenti
traitors
instances they for a sponsor so a lot of
people would use it for my keys that
before you say for a lot publishing gave
me a tour station so that way that means
I temperatures continue during my
meeting our users and the ultra you will
find that will increment to the report
it's very important for now since the
user because the temperature and the
Matterhorn it really helps decrease that
we implement a new atmosphere and you
kick into the system and help you choose
enter your power life and also reduce
your our the system temperature up to 16
of the 60 degrees temperatures Wow jump
or another user's sure that people don't
understand why we keep emphasizing on
temperature because everybody knows I if
you sit over here and inside your
hardware just cannot be affected so
that's reason why we keep telling people
right okay a temperature reading well
I'll manage through your system to isn't
a life and after we change that he
actually helped you out fill out the
system responses and so we before we
have at night three different mostly I
relabel before you go in student I know
we doin alright so that's what Irene
saying with the most read is actually
being confined to one ship basically
allows your system all to these more
efficiently cool to naturally without
any additional support grace and
ascending that were you hello to our new
377 Yuki Feith motherboard which means
the sound of importance so we can have a
Thunder for 14 women to the back of the
eye out here so can I as the first one
productive all sanibel court to the
oh that's all right it's a feature for
feature for sure so there we have the
veneer technology available for both the
z77 and the x79 chipset okay so one
thing that we're seeing is high-powered
technology process serious graphics and
what not being designed on a smaller
platform so here irene's got a mini ITX
motherboard and she's going to tell us
all about it okay so this is our z77 and
Wi-Fi for and the specialty for this
motherboard it has the exclusive and
implemented intel centrino module The
Sentinel manager it provides the app the
special feature which is into a white
time that you can observe your system in
your bedroom and you can tell have the
adapter and send a signal to analysis of
another monitor only yeah so you don't
need to staff to system with your house
but you can just send the same image to
the dialysis new yellow monitor right
you when you are watching a movie you
can just create it in your bedroom and
everybody keep watching a big difference
yeah so this is the very unique feature
for our mini ITX which is perfectly for
htpc and on the back of the UM the
conductivity you can see we have the
fuel lens and also to hdmi Oh excellent
so the spatial Wi-Fi module actually
come with the Wi-Fi Bluetooth spokoynoy
and they supported into my that
acknowledged sprayed me and we always
just tilted me people die off it's
perfect for like a means and it's
perfect for your home theater PC yeah so
this is a very very interesting that we
bring in here to show the people that if
you want a really tiny portable system
that's perfect for that you can use it
for all right very cool hey so I'm
seeing something really intriguing in
the background here um I think that a
minute ago just said 3d bios
so this what's this feature like so I'm
30 miles is because I we design a
specific we first launched it to the
market with our new difference duty the
figures a lot of people they're afraid
of the violence they don't know how to
do a change order files and the reason
why we're showing it with their actual
boy in there so people easier to see
where they are doing a job in how our
ability to change our second change that
way easier for the people who never
really see how well is working so as
more like a user-friendly features
excellent that's just a great way for
people don't know anything about bias to
get into it because as well we all know
there's a lot that Hardware comes with
it we don't exactly maximize out there
so this gives us a good chance to get
the most performance out of our system</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
