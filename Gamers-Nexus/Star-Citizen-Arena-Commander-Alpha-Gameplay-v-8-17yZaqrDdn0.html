donna and today we are in star citizen's
at Hanner module + arena commander the
dogfighting module as it were it has
been released as of last night in
version point at eight excuse me alpha
form so it's quite early in development
will be pretty buggy I am sure but
nonetheless that is the game if you're
curious if I'm excited about this the
answer lies in this helmet that
apparently was already on my head I
don't know how that happened so I let us
let us examine the helmet here this is
quite the helmet will put push f to pick
that up say hi to my my fish right here
is my fish I don't know if you you've
met Bert that is brute let's head over
to the ship I believe this is the Aurora
because as I may have mentioned this the
poor man's hand module it is the
journalists backing the game hander
module that is that is what you get I
suppose in this position so here we've
got our ship many of you have already
seen this part of the game you can lie
down in that bunk if you so please what
we do not please do that we used to go
kill vanduul which are the bad guys in
star citizen or at least some of the bad
guys so the arena commander module is a
dogfighting module it was announced at
PAX East I have video of that
announcement and interviews with chris
Roberts after he announced that he is
the CEO and chairman of Robert space
industries here we have an option to
basically choose free flight versus
killing bad guys I haven't played this
at all in space yet so we were going
straight for killing bad guys and we're
going to pick the map with the most fire
because that seems safe lets it launched
welcome to robert's space industries
enjoy the ride system chen joy the ride
don't tell me how to live my life so
here we've spawned i am assuming wasds
used to control as one would expect it
looks like AMD are used for very handy
flanking i think those are my friends
over there vixen and warlord pretty
appropriate names got some movement with
the mouse
I know that we have to lock on let's
check out these key bindings okay so
pretty cool keybinding screens screen
rather our locks onto the years hostile
that is the only button I need to know
how to use let's jump into this so we
are with throwing some some boomerangs
here to lock on to the hostile enemy and
I'm just gonna close in on it and shoot
so this is raw gameplay footage of the
arena commander module in star citizen
this game is in extremely early alpha
whole I'm gonna hit that thing I think I
think I would hit that thing it's it's a
very early alpha and that means two
things first all means I have no idea
what I'm doing and neither does anyone
else this game right now we are not oh
okay I actually I'm a pro at this game
apparently cuz I just killed that guy
and one of my eyes committed suicide
because I was so good at it that he
decided he was no longer needed um so I
don't know that was like was that an
enemy that suicide I don't know who said
someone suicided but we've got two
enemies on screen here they are both AI
I was not set into the multiplayer dog
fighting test but it is allowing new
players in every every so often so keep
an eye on the channel for that and of
course if you are a backer perhaps you
will get an email as well so star
citizen what is it in its current form
it is currently version point 8 alpha it
is very early alpha available only to
some of the earliest backers on
Kickstarter I need some some energy here
only available some of the earliest
backers and people who have spent a hell
of a lot of money on the game and
outside of that really what you need to
know is that there's a space flight
simulator is a space combat simulator
and in the future we'll have all sorts
of other things like economics and trade
and territorial wars between
effectively Guild's their organizations
in this game but they are effectively
guilds oh gosh um we're just gonna
pretend that did not happen but I think
I actually crashed into the enemy there
so good news for you Chris if you are
watching chris Roberts and star citizen
team collision works I have tested
collision for you that was intentional i
am doing some freak you a right to that
how in collision looks like looks like
we've still got the two enemies i don't
see the third one so i think we're still
only got two well this this hey I thin
in my my helmet talks a lot so we've got
uh oh right point 8 alpha if you are
playing this or you will be playing this
shortly report any and all bugs that you
find because it is a true alpha this is
not some early access basically done
alba know it is actual alpha it's going
to be buggy the assets in terms of art
and graphics are not done yet in fact
the first thing I did before even
starting my recording was check graphic
settings and you'll see here that we've
got one option which is quality and it
basically goes low it's a high or very
high rather so on a 780ti that is not a
concern we're just going to leave it at
max okay connection to server lost I was
not on the server anyway so that's not a
concern for us right now but yeah as I
was saying graphics are not done art
assets are not done this is all
basically for the most part place hold
is what I understand
we have spoken with the team pretty
extensively over at cloud Imperial games
the guys working on star citizen and
they've got they've got a long way to go
but that's okay because the game now has
43 I want to say million dollars behind
it may be a little more it's quite a lot
of money so they have a ways to go to
make sure they're delivering the product
that they really want to deliver and I
think it's okay to take time on that so
n alpha the purpose of this really is
just to get some of the early backers
and supporters in to see the game make
sure you know make sure that it is being
scanning Oh scanning I there's a third
one so it is in fact being worked on
that's kind of the primary item here to
inform their backers and also it's to
help them alpha test and that's really
just to kind of ease load on the team
and make sure some of the systems are in
place in so far as a multiplayer combat
that is the most important element here
for testing I'm trying to figure out if
I'm gonna hit this thing or not so so
for multiplayer testing they're really
just looking at how stable is this game
with multiple layers how many players
can it support in my interview with
chris Roberts at PAX East we were told
that that the current number is 11
players and that was as a pack see so it
may well have changed if you are in the
multiplayer alpha 4 arena commander
please comment below and let us know
what the max player count is right now
but for AI we've got three bad guys in
wave one and then are too trusty enemies
only one of whom has attempted to kill
himself multiple times
but i apparently can't speak because i
keep almost crashing with the vanduul
ships here that was a pretty cool
looking ship I do not believe ship
boarding and shipped captures
implemented yet but if it were that
would be that would be my my number one
priority right now is capturing that
thing although I have kind of lit a
flame at this point so we see our damage
numbers popping up there as I'm shooting
these things that is the damage i am
doing to them not vice versa as far as i
know and we've got our UI elements on
the left here you can see the fairly
interactive you I on the left side of my
screen as I'm spinning in six axis in
space that is pretty cool stuff so the
UI is meant to be fairly immersive well
that's cool I keep interrupting my
sentences here can you tell i'm excited
for a protesting this thing finally so
that is the boundary that's very Hunger
Games like really oh my gosh that was
close anyway anyway was the same the UI
is supposed to be very immersive and
useful but it's not supposed to look
like it sits flat and to dimensionalize
in most games and part of this is for
virtual reality purposes so oculus rift
will be fully supported oh yeah there we
go sweet killed them also virtual
reality stuff like the oculus rift will
be fully supported and that is only
expanded by the UI being a proper
three-dimensional UI that means he is
hovering off these panels over here the
panels are not done by the way those
will actually have things on them in the
future but if we hit tab here you can
see that we release the cursor and can
move around freely there's nothing to
interact with right now I believe there
we go it is supposed to allow you to
free look which is pretty cool
especially once we start getting into
multi ship combat and things of that
nature so let's let's get back into the
fight here now in terms of the UI on the
left side we can hit f1
f two brains up our weapons in their
current state we lock onto another me
here so you can see how that works you
can see I've got two laser cannons on
this ship because I have the be very
very poor Aurora so they have energy
that gets strained as I fire that's
what's been going on this whole time
that's why my my fire rate slows down as
I shoot more of it and also why I try to
be kind of sparing sometimes when I'm
not a hundred percent sure I can just
hit them off the bat if we go ahead and
hit f3 it will give us a look at oh man
that was pretty exciting that's a lot of
damage it gives us a look at all of our
items tranny on the ship I believe this
is effectively an inventory nothing we
can really interact with right now at
least not in my ship oh that's what it
does it says killed itself when uh when
you kill it in fact so f 4 gives us our
shields right now we can only see front
shields and they're at a hundred percent
but you can see that the ticker bar
their surrounding toward front did
decrease when I got hit so they are it
is a functional UI elements
and in the future I don't think we can
do this right now or at least not in the
ship but in the future you will be able
to divert energy from different
components of your ship like shield or
weapons to the other same goes for
throttle and things of that nature
you'll also be able to go dark if you
want to try and be more stealthy and
sneak up on someone you can go dark to
disable effectively your visibility on
their radar in terms of infrared track
and another types of track and things
like that so lots of other cool stuff
coming in this game in the future
espionage is one of those items between
organizations which are again the
equivalent of guilds so espionage will
be handled basically by allowing players
to join multiple gills equivalents so
that they can spy on one and report back
to the other pretty cool stuff
definitely getting some meta game into
the actual game and working at all
unlike within the content very smoothly
in a way that still fits canon
simulation boundaries I think that guys
almost at this I'm going to ignore them
I believe I tested this at pax a little
bit I believe we can get the camera and
third-person let's try that out okay so
this is impossible to shoot but you can
see the ship so that's kind of cool to
insert again there's some more of the
ship that looks like the back there's
the front of the ship with me sitting
and they're flying like a pro AKA i have
no idea what i'm doing please help me
and we'll hit insert again to go back
into the cockpit
we can zoom in and out which is really
just a super focus in your eyes I
suppose when you scroll up and down
let's get in here and kill this guy help
out who is that vixen that snakes let's
help out vixen turn by hit our to log on
takes a second to lock on you can also
cycle target I plead with E or T one of
those two buttons so we're gonna swivel
around here keep them locked in our
sights and boom that is one more enemy
down time to swing this baby around and
hits the last one and trigger the third
wave so really not too hard to get used
to be pretty cool I have the FPS counter
in the top right hopefully that's not
bothering you I think you guys can see
that that is from fraps the reason for
that is really just let you know the
kind of frame rate i'm getting with the
780 ti and 3570k i know that may be
intimidating given the price of the 780
ti and the fact that this is 60 FPS but
i do not think you need to worry it it's
just the game is not at all optimized
it's not even close to that point yet
because they're not done with the art
assets and it is of course not even
integrated with any type of drivers at
the moment as far as we know AMD and
NVIDIA of course cannot release drivers
for a game that is not anywhere close to
completion so it is is not optimized in
its current state which means that
you're going to get pretty pretty
average and not impressive the FPS on
just about everything
that you play with but such is the
nature of an alpha certainly not a bad
mark on this game let's go for this guy
his name is little cane I want to take
him out and I believe there can only be
one little king so that is what I am
going for right now i want to hold the
title of a little vanduul what does it
say prime prime little cane oh my gosh
oohhhhh not die I think he died right
when I flew through yes I don't know if
something was dead and we flew right by
it and got lucky so that was a good on
us I suppose you can see we've got the
mini-map in the center there it's
actually kind of an orb it's pretty
pretty cool in terms of immersion that's
how I've been finding these guys thus
far oh man now you can see our shields
working apparently i'm currently testing
these shields left side check that UI
element out you can see it dropped all
the way down to ten percent for a moment
there until I could escape and let it
recharge I'm not sure if our whole
strength is also shown in that location
perhaps that's what the inner bluetick
is representing the whole strength or
something
good thing that guy is a good pilot
because that would have been deadly a
second time now trying to take him this
one's actually hitting me this is much
harder than the other ones pretty fun a
pretty fun combat for something that is
currently so so simple for testing has
promise for the future of course I do
want to make note this game is not donya
it has a lot of money behind it please
be careful with how much one of you
invest into a game that has really no no
no promises in terms of getting all of
it back some people have invested a huge
amount of money and do you need to be
careful with that because it is always
possible for a game to be bad just look
at my just to get my thoughts on watch
dogs for that so I think this is as good
a stopping point as any you can see my
Maya ember charred remains floating
around in space with what appears to be
could it is that a helmet I believe
there's a helmet in there so once again
guys this is the star citizen arena
commander module star citizen is being
released in modules starting with the
hangar module already out the arena
commander module now out and in the
future we are looking forward to the
multiplayer dog fighting extension and
some of the FPS mechanics I did an
extensive interview with chris Roberts
on FPS mechanics at PAX East go to our
channel hit the search button and type
in chris Roberts or fps or star citizen
and you will find all three of those
things if you are interested in this
game there's a lot of content on my
channel check it out please like comment
and subscribe to make sure you see the
future stuff and I will see you all next
