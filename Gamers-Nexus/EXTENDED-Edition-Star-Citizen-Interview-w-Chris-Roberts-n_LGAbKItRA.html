say the end of June June 28th which I
think went over quite well we basically
re-engineered the website the original
one was built on WordPress and it was
kind of this Franken say it was sort of
a combination of a crowdfunding plug-in
platform that wasn't very robust
WordPress and they just had all sorts of
issues and it couldn't scale very well
so we built a new site there's a
completely custom site that's built to
be the site for the game like when it
launches and can support millions of
people and have a proper sort of basket
system and be able to buy and sell and
trade and do all the rest of stuff with
your items that was big nightmare before
and have a lot better way of content and
with and we're going to be rolling out a
lot more community features for it so
the current website maybe has 30% of the
final functionality there's going some
really cool features we're actually
going to redo we're going to do a whole
new custom forum system and comment
system that we're building from scratch
because sort of plug in the vBulletin or
the vanilla one which we're using now
just don't do it for the level of
interaction community we want integrated
with the game and there'll be a really
cool collector pedia but at least we've
got the foundation out there now and the
whole server system scales and it's much
easier for us to manage things on a on a
customer service basis so that's really
good
we unveiled some more ships so we showed
off what the idris corvette looks like
which i think people liked and a few of
the other things like what the
caterpillar looks like and we did a sort
of 300i brochure which was sort of more
in depth of the 300 a ship and also had
sort of in fiction commercial for it
that was really well received so it was
basically done as a commercial like you
would imagine origin Jim works and you
know in the far future would like a BMW
style commercial and so all that sort of
happened which is great and then you
know in the meantime the team's been
really busy on the hangar module which
is sort of what I was just sort of
running around this is a sort of rough
there's a bunch of things broken in in
the bill but the idea is
you will like we're going to launch it
at Gamescon August 24th we have a party
on that Saturday and then after that let
people download it and it's our very
first testbed of getting the client the
engine the simple part of it out getting
our stored on people's machines and
working through you know whatever issues
would be like compatibility issues all
the rest of stuff and that will allow
players to in their hangar they'll see
the ships they've pledged the very first
wave of the hangar module will only have
the initial pledge ship so that would be
the Aurora 300 I Hornet freelancer
constellation but after that our plan is
to continually sort of all these modules
release you know the hangar module going
to a dogfighting module at the end of
December then the following year we'll
have a planetside module and then we'll
have a single-player alpha and then the
sort of alpha beta of the persistent
universe all these modules that we do
once we release one version they don't
they're not static we will like rev them
every couple of months with a new drop
and be adding features adding content so
the whole idea is iterative development
with the community so they're sharing in
it they're getting to participate in it
so I hope they all understand that at
the early stages I mean you know this
like when we do the hangar and we do the
dogfighting it won't be as polished as a
you know a beta is on an MMO that
they've worked on for three or four
years because this is a much earlier
process but I think ultimately it will
make a better game and a better
experience for people at the end because
by knocking out the problems early I
think it will be much smoother in the
end but at the beginning I'm sure
there's going to be lots of teething
problems I'll be just install issues you
know we got performance issues right now
because we haven't really concentrated
on doing all the different level of
details of the different ships which so
if you don't have a fast machine you
know it may run slower you'll definitely
run slower than it will in the final
bill but we've been how to work on the
hangar module for launch later this
later on in August and then we're also
in parallel working on various things
for the dogfighting which happens at the
end of this year
and so those are our two big main
focuses the art crew is cranking on all
the ships which are pretty involved I
mean a simple ship like a fighter
something like an Aurora is after the
concept concept parts done it's two to
three months
so the concept part we design it out and
we model it in 3d and that itself can
take you six weeks to eight weeks and
then after that when we bring it into we
want to bring into the engine we got to
clean up the model we've got to texture
it
we've got to break it apart into sub
objects rig it animate it and bring it
into the engine so that can that can
take anywhere like from very beginning
to the very end I think probably the
shortest we could do is present like
three months and and much more like six
months or so on the bigger project I
want ship yeah so there's a lot so
there's a lot of well you know on the
ships that we do like when we're sort of
in the engine mode there's like six or
seven people working on it on different
parts and components of it so right now
probably the most resources we have on
the project are our resources so
internally we have
and we have about nine artists
internally and then there's about 20
actually if I include the ones behavior
is probably bout twenty four artists
outside of our nine so there's almost
like there's probably the biggest amount
of staff on the project right now is an
art team so there's probably about 30
people or so that are just working on
art a lot of them are focusing on the
ships some are focusing on the
environments like the actual hangar the
walls sections and some are on
characters so we'll be showing some more
character stuff but if you looked at the
300 a commercial you saw the spacesuit
that the guy was wearing that was like
one of the first outfits that we worked
on but yeah it's all I mean basically
there's a lot of asset production work
because it's it's you know all the
models much more dense and complicated
than say they would have been if you're
making it for a you know a 360 or ps3
star game well ya know so well that's B
well you'll see a little bit of it in
the hangar because you'll be able to
walk around in the hangar in first
person or third person when the
planetside module will be sort of just
expanding that out way you'll be outside
going to the space bar or going to the
ship dealer and it'll basically be the
first sort of public prototype of what
it will play like or feel like down on
the planet between your space missions
but you know that side of things is
actually of all the things we're doing
the less that's not that difficult
because we're working CryEngine it's got
a very strong first-person engine so
actually on we don't do comment combat
on the planet but we do combat like ship
dish you know ship boarding action that
doesn't require that's not a huge
engineering task because most of the
functionality is already there so we
have to do some extra stuff to deal with
zero-g and some other effects we want to
have and we have to do stuff to
interface with the server and deal with
the persistent universe so that's
actually probably the biggest
engineering challenge is the persistent
universe the server how you load balance
that how you deal with the instances but
the actual connects of walking around a
first-person the objects that's really
more a asset creation task because we
know we have
I think we promised 100 systems I think
right now a map has about 115 systems
each system can have multiple locations
planets and each planet some of the
planets can have multiple landing
locations so something like Earth has
three landing locations presently I just
turned my student so so that's an asset
creation so we're doing a combination
some locations will have unique designs
assets and some will be sort of a more
modular system so like you know colony a
you know will be made up of bits that
you have on sort of that level of planet
so that so so they're planetside stuff
is more about like the overall design
figuring out what the content is
figuring out an efficient way that we
can build assets to populate it all and
still make it interesting so I would say
that's more a sort of design and content
challenge than a technical challenge
technically the biggest challenge I
would say is the sort of back-end server
stuff some level of performance
optimization and and then just making
sure all the complicated ship systems
that we're thinking about for
dogfighting work well
star citizen as it comes out the first
Rev or whatever it's not going to have a
seamless like you fly from atmosphere
down onto a planet and we like generate
a whole procedural planet because with
the amount of star systems and planets
we have it's just us so now unless
you're doing some generic random looking
planet which I'm not a big fan of it's
that's like a Content issue just created
that many assets so what's going to
happen is we're not going to have any
loading screens but you'll be in orbit
around a planet and then you'll
negotiate your landing at which location
you want to land at and they'll give you
clearance to land when you've negotiated
it you're sort of basically here you
know autopilot the same as you would do
say in a Wing Commander or a privateer
and it would initiate the landing
sequence which will be an engine so
you'll sort of see you'll be like your
point of view and it'll just it will
sort of take control you won't be able
to fly it down and you'll be point of
view going through the clouds externally
will see you you know
ship going through clouds and then the
clouds will break and you'll see the
area landing and you'll land and land on
the pad and then controls back to you
and you can step out and go visit this
the bar or the shop or whatever this
yeah yeah no so now we have a very
complicated so we have a maybe I
shouldn't say complicated I should say
ambitious sort of faction set up so
there are player there their game
defined ones like standard things like
you know the merchants guild or the
missionaries guild or the UAE or their
Jean which is sort of the various
factions or races that you can be
members of a work for be aligned with a
be an opposition against we're also
allowing the players themselves to
generate their own factions at all
levels so you can have you a small group
or a bigger group the guild three
members of oceans so we'll have both
player Janet and player created factions
and game creative factions and then your
reputation between will get you know
monitored and you know if yeah if you're
if you're a wanted outlaw in UE space
you probably not going to get landing
permission to land on earth and so what
will you know will generate that and
that will also they'll also affect you
know who you who you fight who you you
run into when you're in space you're
flying around because the position
universe is always looking and seeing
where the different players are and
matching them up based on okay well
you're a pirate and you're a merchant
and you're going to cross paths well
then you know put you into an instance
and you can resolve that conflict
tell me more about the types of
encounters come across in space well
well I mean this did I mean this there's
two levels right so there's going to be
the PV stuff which is the MPC stuff and
and I think about a week ago we released
a sort of how our economy dynamic
economy is going to work we did on our
website and the key with it is that it's
not just the economy it's basically a
system that generates missions as well
as you know people buying and selling so
sort of like the idea is a closed-loop
system where planets generate resources
you've got to refine them you've got to
get them to other places where they
manufacture them into ships or missiles
or food or whatever it would be
and the doing that generates missions
for people to trade it also creates
opportunity for pirates to pray on it
pirates pray on a trading run then that
will also generate missions from the
factory that didn't get the goods it was
expecting so the mercenaries guild
saying here can you go in you know play
escort on the trading run because I'm
not getting my goods
so the actual economy itself does a lot
of the mission generating so the idea is
if you're flying around in the universe
relevant of whether you've said I want
to be more pvp or more PvE you will see
an active universe you will see people
going about their days goods going from
one planet to another planet pirates
preying on a mercenaries defending a law
enforcement going after the bad guys and
if you are like so on it just wants to
be sort of PvE and and more along those
lines you'll still see this active
universe it's just that a lot of the
ships you'll see will be MPC ships or at
least the ones that would be hostile to
you maybe the ones that won't be hostile
to you would be like a player and then
if you're more pvp it's going to
matchmake you up with people you know
against real players versus NPC's so
basically what happens is in our system
we simulate the whole world like sort of
a an AI ecosystem say and these are you
know this is these aren't the actual
proper numbers but just to give you an
example say there was 20 million AI
agents running around in this universe
at any one time we're only ever going to
get two million real players so
basically all that happens is when a
real player logs on he kicks
an AI out of the spa so in the case
where they'll be 2 million real players
playing there will be 18 million AAA
agents simulating and 2 million players
playing around the universe so the
universe is always no matter what you
can go on by yourself no one else could
be on and it would still feel like it's
alive it's just been run by AI so what
happens is real players just basically
kicking a out of the slot but and either
way it feels like an ongoing evolving
you know active universe which i think
is is the way we're trying to solve one
of the big problems of a multiplayer
game which is you know it's only fun
when there's a big player base right if
there isn't a big player base then who
do you fight against whatever and the
way we work is well there's always
someone it just may be an AI and the
same happens for missions in the economy
like you know this Factory says I need
three tons of steel alloy and puts a
mission out there well if a player
doesn't take the mission then an AI
agent will take the mission and that
will generate a you know a merger that
goes from one planet to another planet
and and so I think it will be it will be
different than what a lot of these other
games have been I don't know we'll see
but I mean it's my instinct that it will
kind of sort of combine the best of like
what worked well in the privateer or a
freelancer which was more a
single-player experience and then what
works well in sort of a full MMO where
you've got the social experience where
you're playing with your friends or even
fighting against other people one of the
questions from a community was about how
you're handling
specifically asking for PvE players will
there be any direct involvement from the
development side in terms of mixing
things up like it's falling a war
between one owner would definitely so
that the whole design was kind of I was
saying if that economy system I
described is sort of an emergent system
so it sort of reacts to what's happening
and what the players are doing or who's
blockading whatever so the goal of the
game design is to have the players by
their own actions generate a lot of
what's happening in the universe and a
lot of the conflict and interest and
intrigue and then we as sort of the game
masters are adding and feeding new
content in on a weekly basis the same
way on a website that we have like eight
to ten posts a week we'll be adding new
content in but the idea is you know we
can never add enough content to keep up
with how gamers are I mean they'll just
blow through everything faster than you
can great the idea is the gamers
themselves create 8090 percent of the
content that they're consuming
essentially because it's all about you
know their struggles for power or now
which factions with what other faction
and then we add in additional sort of
stories like so like you know like a
cool like five mission series where you
could get this one item or we create a
new sort of bad guy NPC or we have a new
star system that we add this one can
discover and so we sort of add these
things in to sort of keep things
changing and evolving and we're also
looking at what the players are doing
and based on what the players are doing
we're sort of feeding that back into
what we're doing sort of saying okay
well you know this one faction is
getting the upper hand in this area of
the galaxy so let's make some new
stories about it in our newscasts and
then maybe let's send some you know
let's let's switch something up so you
know this other faction can come over
here and get involved in what's
happening over there so the idea is to
make people feel like this universe is
an ongoing living evolving universe and
not something that's static like I don't
like on a lot of the MMO
played and it's hard for me to really
get into a lot of them is they sort of
feel like you're in a very earrin
timeslice static world and then
occasionally there's an update say once
a year or something and then they change
the world and I don't want the model of
this should be more like very small
iterative updates which is also what
we're doing on the development that's
why we're dropping things like the
hangar module and dogfighting and doing
it or development of them so it's just
it's a different way of thinking about
it but that's that's kind of the goal
huh yeah yeah tell you what will we use
that I mean so and actually one of the
reasons why we're doing the public
facing deliverables is the you know one
problem to anyone that tells you about
agile scrum is that people like you kind
of kind of abuse it when it's an
internal thing whereas yes it's always
meant to be on like you're going towards
a goal and it's a demo you're gonna have
to do but you know when you're doing a
demo for 200,000 people
you can't like fake it right so it
actually forces you to actually have it
work properly and not be kind of
jerry-rigged in the background so that's
kind of one of the reasons why we're
doing it because I sort of feel like
it's it's going to force us to get our
homework done sooner let me say that way
because what happens normally
development is that you tend to finish
everything to like 80% of the way and
you're like alright that's easy to do to
fix up the last one but you're off to
the next task because you're so busy and
then what happens at the end that's why
projects slip quite a bit is at the end
of it you just you have a lot of things
that you have to clean up and not any
one of them is particularly like
difficult or time-consuming but there's
so much of it that it just you don't
have enough time to get it all done and
that's why everyone crunches at the end
of projects and I'm not saying that our
method is inherently going to make us be
brilliant and everyone else dumb but I
do think what it's forcing us to do is
instead of having like one big crazy
crunch at the end it's sort of smaller
sprints where there's little crunches
for it but you're in better shape as you
get towards the end so you know it says
you know it's like I don't know it's
hard to give a good analogy of it but it
would be like now you've got to run 26
miles but you decide that you're not
going to you know run flat out for the
last two miles you decide that every
mile you're going to run 100 meters at
the end of the mile
fast and then you'll slow down again and
do it again I mean we're basically you
know implementing the system that I've
talked about we've got most of it up and
running so the way the ships work is all
the functions in a ship like like
they're tied to an actual object and
item so like a targeting computer is an
actual item that gets attached into your
ship an engine is an actual item the
thrusters each one of the thrust is an
actual item the life supports an item
each one of the guns would be an item
you know so the power plan that powers
your main thruster engine or the
thrusters that's an item and they all
connect to each other they have pipes
and we can define the pipes but standard
ones would be power power power pipe a
data pipe a heat pipe so like a lot of
things like like in the computer right
you power it requires power but then it
generates here and you have to dissipate
the heat so in a game and for instance
for us like you know our version of
stealth is you just don't really have a
very yet I'll have a big radar or
electromagnetic signature and so you
don't want to be generating a lot of
heat because that's going to be create a
bigger signature for the radar so you
know a really fully stealthy ship was
basically like a super cool computer and
so you would need like a cooling you
know your various like coolers attached
to your engines and guns to dissipate
the heat but of course they'll take some
slots away from something else which
could be a shield unit or whatever so
they're basically all these different
parts in a in a work with each other and
so I mean you should almost think of the
of the ship itself being almost like a
case in the PC world and you decide you
know what brains you're putting in it
what GPU you're putting in what CPU you
know I mean all those things are
basically what you can customize that's
one of the reasons why I think that you
know the games can be pretty interesting
because you know you could have the same
players with the same chip and they
could have they could have basically
kitted out their with totally
different builds and there's definitely
gonna be a rock-paper-scissors to it
right so one kind of build will probably
trump another bill but then you could
Trump that build with a different kind
of build so part of I think combat
when you're going up against people were
kind of known how they set up you know
they set up they set up a ship morphus
for stealth and if so you need to change
out your package for that because like
if you have a really stealthy ship it's
hard to get radar locks for your weapons
and all the rest of stuff so maybe you
need to have more scanners you know they
and but more scanners will mean that you
can't have as many other you know
whatever weapon or as much power so so
so we basically implemented that system
you know the balancing of it's going to
be a challenge but it's really cool and
all those and the other thing that's
really cool is each one of those systems
has a physical component that gets put
in the ship so like if you're shooting a
ship for instance it's like it would be
on a real ship it's not like we just
roll a dice in which which which system
gets hit it's literally our bolt go
through like if we knock the shields
down and we're going through the hull
we've knocked the armor down now where
our projector whether it's a physical
projectile or an energy ball we trace
that through the actual ship and does it
hit that does it hit the life support
does it hit the power plant does it hit
this and if it does it'll do damage to
it and with those damage to it because
of the power system how they connect it
will affect all they all the systems in
it so it's all very emergent behavior
it's like it's it's it's basically much
more simulated than it should judicial
because in a game most of this stuff is
just like okay you've gone through the
armor and now you've got a 20% chance
you're going to hit the power plant and
a 30% chance you'll hit this and you've
done it critical here well that's not
the way this works this is like
literally if you're shooting in the
right place where you know whether the
power plant is or whether the life
support would be then then and you get
through the armor you'll hit it and
you'll do damage to it and if you do
damage to it it goes down then you know
it goes I mean I you know the game is
skill base right so it is not it's
you're not you're not just clicking on
it and shooting on it so it's really
down it's down to you as a player
knowing when you're shooting a ship kind
of you know I I what I expect is the
better players will start to sort of
learn like in which ship where the
components are and they all sort of know
what areas to target once they've
knocked down the shields and arm so I
would say it's mostly skill based you
know in terms of you just being able to
target I mean there's various there's
various ways you can target
one is obviously just flying
old-fashioned world war two style move
your nose around target but you know on
a lot of the ships they also have what
we call class two or class four turrets
but the class two turrets generally like
one on the Apache where you know like if
you had the rift on you're looking
around and you're where you're looking
is controlling where that gun is
targeting so we'll definitely you know
all those kind of parts will be in there
so I just think there'll be a lot of
fidelity and finesse in that part of the
combat and make it much deeper than say
any other space game has been for this
kind of thing that's actually a good
suggestion I don't think we were
thinking about underclocking but I don't
think there'll be any reason why you
shouldn't underclock it to reduce your
your your your heat signature I mean
basically the process that we do is all
the items get created and it's just like
a chip where basically they'll have a
potential that can go over what they're
you know the default is and we just will
when we create the item we roll a number
you know maybe it's 20% maybe it's 30%
and then you as someone that takes that
item if you go beyond the recommended
setting you're just risking destroying
the item but you know sometimes maybe
you have to destroy a couple items and
you now get that rare item that can go
plus 30 percent I think may generate
more heat but you may have a bill that
you've set up where you know you'll just
do a little more damage for each one of
your ship so but I definitely would see
the ouvea
there'll be sort of a market inside the
game where someone like actually goes
and collects these things overclock some
and builds bills and then sells them for
you know you know you know say twice as
much as the base ship would cost but
then you know you've got that little bit
of edge yeah totally absolutely yeah you
know like you know with whoever the best
over caught you know digital storm
whoever it would be origin PC you know
they they can get that extra yeah
they're there they'll definitely I think
they'll be like boutique ship people out
there actually
the question in terms of players sign
items are you handling that through some
kind of auction house system well we're
going to let people yeah we're going to
basically sort of have a Craigslist sort
of set up inside the game so people will
be able to sell for game currency inside
the inside the game there probably will
be a sales tax they'll be on that just
in general there's everything that we've
got has like when you land there's a
certain amount of like it's like
transferring title to something right if
you sell so on a car you got to pay your
title fee it will all be in-game
currency I think I mean so that's so
it's not there'll be a small amount of
that but it won't be don't think of this
like an RPG where like the mechanic is
you kill a bunch of orgs and they drop
blue and then you take the loop back and
you sell it for whatever and then
upgrade an armor and stuff so it's not
so much like there won't be as much loop
drop like so normally if there's a
combat and you blow a ship up like most
of the stuff like the parts or it won't
be salvageable man if you if you take
over capture the ship then yeah you
could basically strip off the parts of
sell the parts so most of the time if
you were going after a ship and shooting
it it's more about like getting it to
give you its cargo because the cargo
would spill out and you could tractor
that it so the thing is that them
because there's a bit of controversy
because people look at the video no it's
not right but the actual physical
simulation of the ship and how the
thrust is assimilated is 100% correct
you know it generates an impulse of
thrust to start it turning an impulsive
thrust to stop it turning there's no
resistance in space but the visual
representation that say in that video is
really a representation of what the
velocity what the angle of velocity is
and not where the impulses from the
thrust only because in space it doesn't
actually require much impulse to start
you rotating so if you actually visually
showed what was really happening
basically you would see the thrust ago
and then it would go back to neutral and
and fire that way so
I sort of I had it doing it the correct
way originally it just looked buggy so I
changed it so you could just sort of see
the thrust of facts it's kind of cool to
see the thruster articulate and fire but
the actual physical simulation
underneath it is a hundred percent
correct I'm actually I have I haven't
had time it's one of the programming
things that I'd like to go and play with
you know because it's been some
discussion on the forums I realize not
that's not correct and I've try to
explain to them that you know it's
actually simulated correctly it's just
the visuals are not matching up to
what's actually happening in the
simulation just because of the visual
glitch aspect of it but I you know I
think probably I will change it so
you'll see it fire and then as it's
starting to you start to slow down
you'll see articulate and far in the
opposite direction to slow you which
still won't be a hundred percent correct
because you actually are only firing a
small burst each way and will obviously
keep it longer but I'll do it I think is
that well I think will address some of
the the complaints people have and I
think will make it a bit clearer so that
will be maybe a better blend between the
visual realism and and what I call sort
of the sci-fi cool side of it right
which is we have that constant struggle
it's like you know yeah there's no
there's no sound in space but you know
you've seen Star Wars you like to hear
to to know and yeah and also generally
if you think about futuristic
dogfighting odds are it's not going to
be humans piloting it it would become
it'll be computers because they can you
know the the ship itself could take a
huge lot more forces like when its
maneuvering speeds were probably much
greater than we currently allow you to
do because we sort of keep it sort of in
the Star Wars realm where it's
essentially world war ii dogfighting in
space well that's kind of fun I mean
it's like even in today's world
dogfighting isn't what it used to be
forty years ago I mean most of us beyond
visual range of here on a Monday jet
fighter you know the you know
most of the Jets and especially the US
ones are all set they're all really for
beyond visual range engagement which you
know is in the real world kind of nice
and safe what's not safe but it's it's a
it's it's less dirty than getting up
close and it's definitely safer if
you're of the America that has the best
technology against someone else but in a
game sense it's not nearly as much fun
as getting on someone's tail and seeing
them and that tight turning place so so
we always we always have to go the you
know the there's a boundary between
realism and coolness and fun well not
really I mean I think that you will not
be able to reload your sort of external
amount of missiles unless you've landed
in your rearm and refuel it should be
like real life so I mean part of part of
one of the goals and other one of the
nuances of the combat is you know
management of your ammo right so your
energy guns don't run out of ammo they
generally power from your power plant
power plants you know are things like
fission fusion antimatter they don't run
out of power but your engines your
thrusters expel matter to push you
forward so you actually have to collect
the matter to go forward so like
hydrogen will be like you know one one
kind of matter you could be expelling so
basically the power plant creates
basically the the the you know helps
fuel the the energy transmission where
you're pushing out this manner which
will propel you forward so you so you
have to manage things like your fuel
levels which is basically the matter
using two for propulsion but also ammo
so now yes we have energy weapons but we
also have a traditional projectile
weapons so one would be obviously
missiles but other ones will be things
like you know real like uranium depleted
rounds or something and the idea is that
shields like shields are much better at
like
absorbing an energy weapon like a laser
but then maybe not so good at like
absorbing a projectile weapon like a
like a bullet from her like an hour
person Gatling gun or something but of
course your projectile weapons will have
limited amounts of ammo because you
can't have an infinite amount where the
energy do so I actually would see
there'll be strategy of players
depending on which gun loadouts and
which guns they switch depending on what
situation like if you're on someone and
you kind of want to do some damage and
he's got full shields and you got some
you got some hard ammunition then that
may be a way you would want to use your
mass drive account instead of using your
laser gun or something and so the
management of your ammo is important
which would include missiles and so
partly the game is about you know you
know where how you would resupply where
you would go that's one of the reasons
why we talked about having like an
asteroid base is one of the features
that like a pirate's find an asteroid
base and take it over that would be a
place they could keep missiles and ammo
and fuel close to the trade lane and we
make it much more effective for them
raiding then someone it doesn't and you
know we also have you know a star fire
which is another ship which is a ship
mostly for transporting fuel gas around
so we'll definitely have that whole
there'll be some level of sort of supply
so I would see a bigger group of people
say maybe operating as a squadron or as
a guild you know there will be logistics
for having sort of combat operations on
a larger scale just like you would in
real life which I think could be pretty
cool yeah well we're working on the
Hornet so right now we're working
because you know that the only Hornet
we've shown is the military version
you're flying squadron 42 so we're
working on the civilian and the variants
the different parts you can interchange
and stuff so our plan is to sort of
reveal that before the hangar module and
then roll into the hangar module so
we're busily working on on that I think
hopefully people were actually we're
actually you know I thought the Hornet
was cool but you know now we're going
back in and adding more detail and parts
so it's going to be cool
any final clouds for fans and Packers
well no other than say thank you I mean
it's amazing I mean we're getting to
build you know we're getting to build
this game at a level that you normally
would only get to do if you're doing it
at a major publisher but with complete
sort of creative freedom without having
the marketing department you know
sitting over your shoulder going oh you
need to broaden it out so we get the
casual player players in and do this and
this game sold well so let's do that and
we need you in this quarter so we can
really just concentrate on making a
great game in the only and and we have
no it we have no other goal than that
and as a game maker that's like amazing
it's it's you know it's like the artists
dream and that wouldn't happen without
the support of the community in the
community you know really you know we're
excited by the game and there is excited
by the game as much as we are which is
you know basically building the game we
want to play and this is the game I
think the community wants to play and
they're enabling and I think it's an I
think it's an amazing sound it's just
it's something is happening that I think
will you know I'm not saying it's
changing everything but it definitely
adds a new element to the landscape of
gaming where you know gamers can have
their voice heard and make certain
things happen that maybe one have
happened in a bigger corporate situation
I think there's that sort of the people
empowerment that the internet sort of
has opened up I mean you know you can
see it on you know this is on the game
side but you know you so you see it in
like yeah whatever I mean whether the
air whether the Arab Spring turned out
well or badly you know a lot of it was
because of the direct connection the
people talking to each other and
connecting that way and I think that
same mechanic is enabling things to
happen my crowdfunding of games and
other things and I think it's really
great I mean I think it's great because
it sort of it lets the voice of the
people or in this case the game is be
heard more so that's fantastic and
and they you know take everyone that's
really back to us cuz you know it's it's
it's a privilege and honor to do that
and I thank you all for letting us do
that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
