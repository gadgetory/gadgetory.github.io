hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the first of
the XIII 90 mother newsy 390
motherboards the MSI XIII 90 godlike and
the thing is as far as I'm concerned the
only thing god liked about this board is
the price because it is $600 last time I
checked and that is quite insane
considering what you're like actually
getting before that this video is
brought to you by the Corsair strafe RGB
mark 2 mechanical gaming keyboard the
strafe mark 2 uses Cherry MX switches
available in MX red and MX silent and
uses the elevated key cap design that
has become part of course there's
keyboard identity elevated key caps make
the keyboard much easier to clean with a
blast of compressed air and limit dirt
build up the keyboard use a metal body
design of have received praise from us
in the past in old reviews for high
build quality learn more about the
Corsair strafe mark 2 at the link in the
description below before we get into all
the vrm stuff like let's just talk about
some of the features scattered around
the board and address this PCIe slot
situation because I saw a lot of
comments when when photos of this board
first came out talking about how this is
totally gonna have like a million PCIe
lanes but for those of you who know how
you like for those of you aware of how
you actually get a million PCIe lanes
out of a CPU with only 16 you can
probably already tell that there is a
significant lack of a very big very
expensive chip on this motherboard
there's no P Alex chip or no P Alex
switch anywhere here so the thing is
these PCIe slots is are wired as 16 CPU
so that's an X 16 on the CPU that's an X
force law so that's a 4 on the CPU again
this is an X 8 and the last one is a X 4
and that's on the PCH and the reason for
that is simple there is no PL x chip
there is no so what a PL x chip is is
basically it goes between the CPU and
the PCIe slots
and it allows you to take you know
sixteen lanes or eight lanes of PCIe and
kind of turn them into like 32 ish kinda
the problem is you you're still you know
ultimately if you want to move a lot of
data to the CPU you're still gonna hit
the limit of that 8 X slot but it
basically does mean that as long as no
other devices using the connection
something can actually get a full 8 X
connection or a full 16 X connection to
the CPU because the plx switch I mean
the plx chip acts basically as a PCIe
switch so that the CPU can communicate
can better sort of balance the available
lanes between the devices this
motherboard does not have that and in my
opinion that chip would have been like a
really good justification for the price
tag that this comes with because the plx
chips are like $50 even when you're
buying them in bulk they are really
really expensive and there are a couple
z 390 boards that actually have that
chip this one's not one of them even
though it looks like it really should
have it considering how many PCIe slots
it has but yeah it doesn't and honestly
that to me is a hugely disappointing
because it's like the board's $600 like
if you don't have a PL x chip what do
you have well they have a postcode so
that's a good thing the starters in
terms of OC features also down along the
bottom edge you get a switch right here
which allows you to control these three
PCIe slots so you can turn those on and
off you do not get control over the PCH
slot so basically also with the
situation on this motherboard it only
supports two-way SLI but you can
actually run like four-way cross fire
off of this because crossfire really
doesn't care how what kind of bandwidth
you actually have hooked up it doesn't
necessarily mean like run great when you
run it through a PCH but you can do it
SLI won't let you even like enable SLI
if the what some of the GPUs are on a 4x
connection so yeah the this only
supports sort of to a sli even though it
looks and you know looks like it could
support four-way well it doesn't
next to the PCIe on/off switch for the
CPU lanes you get a bio switch so the
board does have dual BIOS the BIOS chips
are soldered onto the board as there are
no socketed chips anywhere on this
motherboard to be seen so that's kind of
unfortunate but hey at least they're
like there's two biases and you do have
a switch to control switch between them
so as far as I'm concerned this is good
enough if you brick one you still have
the other to use and use for unbreaking
the for the other one so that's nice
then we get the break your CPU dial I
really really recommend never ever using
that thing like MSI has low like they've
built motherboards with this dial that
and the the dials just loaded like with
completely stupid settings like settings
so bad that even with liquid nitrogen
they still wouldn't be viable and it's
just like I have no idea who decides
some of these profiles it might have
gotten better recently but honestly just
don't like it's better if you just do
all of your tuning manually because most
of these OC profile like these are all
just sort of preloaded profiles and the
way they make these work is by giving
them way too much voltage and even and
sometimes even that isn't enough to make
them work so it's kind of unfortunate
below that we do find two rather useful
buttons you have a OCFS one here which
assume that means failsafe but the
manual basically calls it a force entry
to bios so that is a safe boot button
it'll get you into BIOS even if you have
bad settings set up you have a retry
button which if you have memory training
issues that can be very very useful to
get the system to post memory settings
that you know are pretty hard to run
these are both basically extreme
overclocking usage only especially the
retry button if you need the retry
button to get your memory settings to
boot they are probably not stable enough
for daily usage so you know it's not
exactly helpful for your daily system
but it is nice for for overclocking and
benchmarking basically an extreme
overclocking that kind of thing so next
to that we find sort of the standard
button load out of reset and power and
quite frankly I am not a fan of having
all of the the nice OC functionalities
except for the post code although
bottom edge of the motherboard because
well I mean the board technically
doesn't support it but you could well
isn't doesn't officially support it but
you could totally do a crossfire setup
where you know you can't get any of
those functionalities but uh because
I'll be covered with a GPU but
considering the PCIe slot PCIe layout
that's not a huge issue but I'm still
not a fan of having like the postcode
miles and miles away from the rest of
your sort of overclocking features and
functionality because it's just like if
you have this on the test bench right
it's like which which edge of the board
do you prioritize to be near the
postcode or the buttons and a lot of the
time you end up where I like with a GPU
obscuring one or the other and it's just
kind of annoying in my opinion so they
should be together but MSI decided to
lay them out like this I guess I mean
it's not I did they kind of have a lot
of space they could have used better up
here in my opinion but this is what they
decided for and at least you do get all
of those features so that that's nice
enough to have in terms of power
connectors we get to eight pins up here
and honestly a single eight pin is
capable of handling easily 400 watts
there's no problem pushing that because
this has four ground connections for 12
volt connections and even by the lowest
spec of this connector you're looking at
least eight and a half amps per pin if
you actually have like a better high
current connector which this motherboard
at its price point should really have
and you have a good power supply that
doesn't use completely you know crap
cables the eight pin on the motherboard
would be plenty to actually handle the
power any amount of power that a ninety
nine hundred K would want to pull except
maybe ln two setups where using an extra
four pin could help out in terms of the
the the power handling situation but
honestly like having two eight pins for
frizzy 390 is really rather unnecessary
if it was an eight pin and a four pin I
I would totally understand that because
you know it would like the four pin
would at least take a decent amount of
load off of the apron and there are some
power supplies which apparently have
issues with like the power supply side
modular connectors getting rather hot if
you pull a lot of power
an 8 pin power connector which is more
like a problem with the PSU you're
buying them the actual motherboard like
that the PSU shouldn't have that problem
as far as I'm concerned but yeah for the
for the motherboard side here like that
this is really really unnecessary on z3
98 pin is plenty for any ambient
overclocking 8 + 4 pin would be really
where I would stop for ln2 though
there's definitely no harm in having the
the full eight and at that point because
if you're doing extreme overclocking
your power supply probably has enough
has enough connectors to run dual eight
pins at the same time now another
connector we have here is a six pin for
the PCIe slots which since this doesn't
really have it like between the fact
that like nvidia is straight up killing
more than dual GPU setups like it's not
supported anymore patent with the r-tx
20 series like on the 1080 TI's you
could at least run for way for like fire
strike and various benchmarks with the
20 series you can't even do that
so within video straight up killing you
know large multi GPU set up support this
connector gets really unnecessary
because well it's the the main function
of that power connector is to basically
help out the 24 pin when you have a lot
of power-hungry PCIe devices and it's
not like I would recommend running a you
know like somebody might want like a
raid card or something which can get
very high power consumption and with
certain like certain high-end ones can
get really high power consumption the
thing is you still only have 16 PCIe
lanes here like that is probably not
gonna work out for you
so yeah it's just this this seems rather
unnecessary if they had the PL x chip
I'd get it because you could like cram
this full of various expansion cards but
as it is like you still only have 16 CPU
PCIe lanes and 4 from the chipset on
this slot down here so I'm not sure what
this is supposed to power I guess
somebody might run for way rx4 80s on on
this or something like cuz that's like
the only thing I can think of that would
really necessitate the 6 pin or some
other you know 4-way 3-way GPU set
that pulls a lot of power from the PCIe
slots but for normal builds this this is
pointless and also if you are actually
like going to be using this like this is
like the worst place to put that
connector just because you're either
gonna have like power cables going like
that across the motherboard or over all
of the GPUs which just like in a normal
build is gonna be really really awkward
and I wouldn't run this motherboard and
I have my doubts about this motherboards
ln2 overclocking capabilities because
there is a serious lack of low dropout
regulators in this area of them well
really just around the entire area of
the CPU socket there's just not there
there's a for Ellen 2 on basically all
of the modern for a mainstream 40
nanometer CPUs from Intel there's a
bunch of minor rails on those CPUs that
you need voltage control over otherwise
they called bog at minus 120 degrees and
you really can't do anything about it if
you don't have those voltage controls
and normally the the way those are
implemented is with a bunch of low
dropout regulators sitting somewhere
around the CPU socket except there are
any of them on this motherboard at least
not that I can see in the picture that
I've been in the pictures that I've been
provided so yeah this like so you know
like for an extreme bang overclocking
board this couldn't make some sense
because they're there you might actually
have a use for four-way crossfire
four-way SLI but it's just like well SLI
still wouldn't work because there's no
plx chip but it's just like you don't
even have the necessary it doesn't look
like you have the necessary voltage
regulators to go below minus 120 degrees
Celsius so that again is just like for a
motherboard that's called godlike and
cost $600 not having a couple you know
three like what even three dollars one
dollar they're like three amp LDOS they
don't cost anything like one dollar
apiece and they don't seem to be here so
that is just like right off the like
that basically in my eyes disqualifies
this motherboard from like extreme
overclocking usage because it's nice
that you know we have this really solid
vrm up here
which we're gonna get to very soon but
there's no like the board's gonna shut
down at minus 120 and that's that and
you're never gonna get to use that vrm
have lower temperatures and that's where
it would that's where you max out the
CPU you know you need to go cold first
before you can crank up the voltage it
doesn't do anything for you if you shove
one point nine volts into a CPU at minus
120 it's just not gonna do anything
so yeah the the lack of the sort of LDLs
in this area is kind of concerning
another overclocking feature that MSI
has included is a clock gen right here
from integrated devices technologies so
yeah it has a clock gen which is pretty
standard for all of the Z like going
from z170 forward that's pretty standard
on behind motherboards to have a clock
gen because Intel split the BC LK
regions for the PCI eSATA and I think
PCH from the memory and CPU BC LK region
so you can actually clock the VCO a b c
lk all in like sky like kb like coffee
like coffee like refresh really really
high and so you need a clock gen for
that since they that's the only way to
go beyond the frequencies that the intel
cpus can normally like normally be set
to because your bc okay normally tops
out at like 1:30 or something just in
terms of what the cpu is capable of
doing by on its own and then with a
clock gen you can go up to like 400
megahertz or something note that it's
actually practical to do that it's just
a possibility anyway that pretty much
covers the sort of the the random fluffy
overclocking features that this
motherboard has it's like I'm not really
impressed mostly because of the lack of
a P Alex chip and the lack of the L and
what seems to be a complete lack of the
extreme overclocking voltage controls so
anyway let's move on to the VR M because
at least there's something nice about
this motherboard so this motherboard
does not support the I GPU whatsoever
there's no i GPU outputs on the rear
over the motherboard and so this vrm
right here is all v core and it has a
lot of phases so you have one two three
four
four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 phases and these are pretty
much real as the motherboard has
international rectifier ir35 99s on the
back of the board but there are IR 3599
doublers on the rear and these are what
I would consider a dumb doubler because
the key feature of an IR 3599 is that it
can do a quad quadrupling like that's
the primary purpose of those is that you
can build like in theory if you wanted
to with with the voltage controller we
have here which that's an IR 3 5 2 0 1
with a 3 5 2 0 1 and as many 3599 s as
this motherboard is running you could in
theory build a 32 phase there's a couple
gigabyte boards that have done that in
like the past on platforms where it
makes zero sense to do that but gigabyte
at the time out of thing four phases so
they had to have more of them than
everybody else so they built a 32 phase
with with the with the 3599 and a
different voltage controller but with
the three five two zero one and 35 99s
you could also do a 32 phase because of
that the 3599 doesn't really have any
advanced like current balancing features
so basically it just takes the PWM
signal coming from the IR 35 from the 35
to 0 1 the signal goes into the 3599 and
then the 3599 just spits splits it in
between a between two phases and it
doesn't really worry about if one phase
is pushing more current than the other
which leads to slightly less than ideal
efficiency for a doubling scheme if you
have proper current balance you can get
even higher levels of efficiency
marginally so than if you don't have any
current balancing whatsoever but
considering the power stages that MSI is
using here the current balance really
doesn't matter like there's way too many
phases and the phases are too good so
the actual power stage is used here RT
da
wait what the hell is that that's a 4
not an a these are 2 TD a 2 and or is it
2 1 4 6 2
news from Infineon slash international
rectifier because Infineon ball
international rectifier so these
actually have the International
rectifier logo on them but it's you know
it's all infini on at this point and
this is the smaller sibling of the TDA
two one four six two one four seven two
which MSI has used on some other
motherboards this thing is only good for
60 amps output instead of 70 but it does
come in the larger packaging so these
are rectangular power stages not square
ones so these should be really easy to
recognize for anybody who watches a lot
of like a lot of my videos and there are
some benefits to the larger package
basically they have better thermal
dissipation as a result of the the
larger packaging since they have more
surface area so that's nice but these
are just 60 amp parts not 70 like the 2
1 4 7 2 s would be and unfortunately the
entirety dat one 4 series of components
just no data sheets they're completely
just covered in NDA's so I can't get my
hands on them and if I did have my hands
on them then I still couldn't talk about
it because they're nd aid so instead I
will use the data sheet for an IR 3575
to get like a rough idea of what you
would be looking at with some other
top-end
60 amp power stage from international
rectifier also because the IR 3575
datasheet is one of the few 60 amp hour
stages that IR has put out like a full
datasheet for so you do have a like
really really powerful like 16 phase of
erm here and the end result is that for
a variety of settings at 500 kilohertz
switching frequency and 5 volts gate
drive now the problem is I do believe
that the TDA 2 1 4 6 2 s will be
slightly more efficient for any given
switching frequency compared to the ir35
35 75 and also slightly more efficient
across the voltage range that you're
gonna be running into them like because
they are the the TDA 2 1 4 series of
parts or spectat 1.8 volts
along with basically all of the other
new large power stages which
are actually smart power stages so they
integrate car very accurate current
monitoring and temperature monitoring
directly into them as well as over
current protection and over temperature
protection so these are you know they're
very very clever the thing is the ir35
2:01 basically sees them in groups of
two so it doesn't actually see them as
individual phases which is why the 3599
is like a dumb doubler because normally
what hat
there are ways to basically have voltage
controllers and doublers that will then
the doubler will still tell the voltage
controller that there's one phase
because the voltage controller literally
can't control more than you know
whatever phases it's pecked out for but
the doubler then can actually current
balance the phases itself if if it's uh
if it has the logic to do that there are
some doublers out there that do that
they're just really really expensive in
general so and you'll see them used on
like top-of-the-line X 299 motherboards
a lot and recently gigabyte has just
crammed them into sort of their
mid-range lighten up because they're
using an ISL voltage controller and they
wanted and doubler and I guess the six
six one seven was just kind of what what
they already had because gigabyte was
using that part 4x 299 motherboards as
well but anyway back to this mod 500
kilohertz 5 volts gate well just drive
voltage which is the voltage that the
power stages use to switch the MOSFETs
on and off as well as all of their to
run all of their internal logic so at
these settings for the sort of various
currents that you would run on LGA 1151
and I've actually kind of ok let's see
so air cooling well let's just say
ambient that'll make it simpler so
ambient and you're gonna have a current
range depending on what CPU you're
you're on of about 150 amps I'm not
gonna include the 9600 K just because
that's an i-5 and I don't know why on
earth you would stick that into a $600
motherboard quite frankly I don't know
why you'd put a 9900 K on this
motherboard either because again there's
no P Alex chips there's no L like
I still don't get what the appeal with
this motherboard is supposed to be
because it just looks like a lot of like
I know with all of the armor on it it
looks really fancy but under the armor I
don't see anything that fancy so I don't
see the like yes it has a really nice 16
phase you don't need that like you
really really don't need that you just
need a good like a good 12 phase or a
good 10 phase he'll even in power like a
strong 8 phase would be perfectly good
for XIII 99 anyway so 150 a to about 200
a so 150 a would be sort of 8700 K
territory and work and this range we're
talking up to one point four volts mind
you this is really hard to cool as I
recently found out when I started
overclocking my 8086 K if you're gonna
run a V X which is where you're gonna
hit these kinds of currents it is very
hot like really freaking off the this
kind of voltage that these kinds of
currents but anyway so 88 the 8700 K as
well as surprisingly enough well not
surprisingly if you actually like follow
CP like if you do a lot of power testing
it's kind of obvious that this would
happen the 9700 K actually sort of 9700
K 8700 K both sort of match each other
on the vcore current poll because this
has hyper-threading which literally just
makes each core do more work and
therefore use more power and the 9700 K
has more cores but no hyper threading so
each core does less work which actually
makes like the 9700 k in my opinion is
gonna be a really nice cpu to overclock
because you're gonna have much lower
thermal density compared to an 8700 k I
got a 8700 K is just really really
thermally dense because you're doing
roughly like each core if you're
actually fully using the hyper threading
capabilities you're looking at about 30%
more work done on each core which
translates to about 30% more power
consumption and about 30% more heat
being produced by each of the cores
which makes the 8700 K really really
halt the 9700 K therefore could end up
clocking higher just because it's easier
to cool due to the lower thermal density
due to the lack of hyper-threading well
8700 k 9700 k that are going to be
looking at about 150 amps of current
poll
point this motherboard should be
producing about 17 watts of heat which
is great like it should have no problem
dissipating that as long as all of the
plastic armor on top of the heat sinks
you know doesn't insulate the heat sinks
too much from being able to draw dump
their heat because ultimately you can
build the best vrm ever and if you you
know put it under a pillow it's still
gonna overheat it just cuz that's what
you know thermal insulation does anyway
200 amps which is where the 99 hundred K
should land if you can actually run it
at one point four volts which that'll be
interesting to see cuz that should be
really like that should just be hotter
than the 8700 K in that point you'd be
looking at about 20 watts of heat output
for the 200 amp current figure so you
know great efficiency for the VR I'm
right there like what we're taught like
this is basically comparable with a lot
of like high end GPU VRMs and GPUs
generally get much much better VRMs than
motherboards because GPU cores pull way
more current than the CPUs but now that
Intel just keeps cranking up the core
counts and you know we're still on 40
nanometer the power consumption on the
the Intel CPUs keeps creeping upwards
so the motherboards are starting to
resemble starting to approach sort of
GPU vrm specs and the end result is that
this this light gets really really nice
efficiency so the vrm is definitely nice
and if it could run on ln2 then for
extreme overclocking organiz
you know sub-zero settings so dry ice
and liquid nitrogen be sort of looking
at the following current draws in this
range so you'd be looking at about 250
amps which i would expect on about dry
ice with like a 9900 k the 9700 K would
really move to like that 200 amp figure
or the 8700 K would move to that 200 and
think you're just you know there it's
not gonna like these aren't gonna
suddenly jump like these aren't suddenly
gonna jump in front of the 99 hundred K
but so 250 amps for some dry ice
overclocking you'd be looking at about
24 watts of heat for the for the vrm so
again just absolutely no problem dealing
with that and then going up from that
- 300 amps output which that would be
like Ellen - with a cold bug should hit
around that 300 amp figure because you
should be able to run up to around 1.6
51.7 volts ish you'd be looking probably
around 30 watts of heat output for the V
R M which again just should be no
problem to handle in fact you normally
you run lnto without any heat sinks
because on LGA 1151 with how cold you
can get these CPUs what tends to happen
is that the heat sinks just turn into a
massive condensation magnet and you just
end up with an absolute lake in the vrm
area which is fine if you have really
good insulation but if your insulation
isn't on point then you can very easily
end up just like killing a motherboard
because all of all of this freezes over
while you're idling that just will
freeze over and then you go under load
and it'll defrost by melting all of that
into water and then it'll freeze over
again build up more condensation and
then defrost again and it'll just get
wetter and wetter and wetter the longer
you run so yeah having an overkill vrm
that doesn't even need any cooling
actually tends to be very very helpful
if you don't like going overboard on the
insulation then unto assuming like if
this motherboard I'm again I don't have
pictures of the back so I'm not sure if
the LD O's are just hidden on the other
side but I don't know MSI has kind of
stepped out of the extreme like Alan to
extreme overclocking seen recently so I
wouldn't be surprised if those LDLs
really just aren't on this motherboard
so it might not even be able to go cold
enough that you could run enough voltage
to hit the 350 amp area which the 9900 K
should be able to do in terms of current
consumption under full multi-core
benchmarks there you'd still be looking
at only about only about 37 watts of
heat output on the vrm which again like
should be no problem for the vrm to
handle and then just for the purpose of
you know seeing how how it would scale
up past that 400 amps which I don't
think is actually achievable on any of
the CPUs that'll fit into the socket you
might be looking at about 44 watts of
heat output
for the vrm so yeah you have a really
really solid V curve erm and that's
really really nice it's just that the
rest of this motherboard is just kind of
like I'm not sure what else like that
you can get a good enough vrm for
ambient overclocking on cheaper boards
like much much much cheaper boards this
thing's insanely expensive and this vrm
doesn't really make much of a difference
to the fact that this is insanely
expensive you know at this price point
even with this vrm hell if they cut back
on the vrm and gave you some actual
features like a P Alex chip or let's say
the well the L do they should charge
extra for temp quite frankly they
shouldn't make a difference to the price
but a PL x chip would be really really
welcome in my opinion on a motherboard
of this this price point like not having
a Felix chip is just really weird as far
as I'm concerned anyway minor V RMS are
actually also really really solid so
down here we have the VCC sa and vc cio
these are both minor rails so I'm not
gonna bother going over the actual heat
outputs they're fine the like there's
never been a board where these would
actually be a concern even on like the
super low end these just don't pull that
much current both of these are
controlled by this chip right here and
that is a chip from Rome semiconductor
so ro HM semiconductor and that is a PV
where is in my notes three two zero five
and for the MOSFETs MSI is using their
favourites the well recent favorites the
4c 0 24 n from on semiconductor and I
just realized that I don't have enough
space in this area and a for C 0 29 n
and these are actually like MOSFETs that
they use for like their main phases on a
lot of the cheaper motherboards and
these are good MOSFETs like I like these
these are actually really overkill for
the purposes of VCCS a nvcc i/o as these
are normally used for like straight V
core power on a lot of other
motherboards now msi makes and the for c
0 24 n is
2.8 million RDS on MOSFETs
which is like 4 as far as cheap
motherboard low side MOSFETs go this is
probably the best low side MOSFET on on
cheaper boards out there like MSI
currently holds the crown for that yeah
and here they're just using it for vc c
SI + vc c io because they have a ton of
these because they use them on a bunch
of other boards and in stores like well
they're overkill for this but I mean
next to this vrm this quite frankly
isn't that overkill like these could
have had two phases or something and it
would have still been like our next two
because of that 16 phase that still
looks kind of like a reasonable
motherboard design decision right there
so that's your VCC sa and vc cio moving
on to the very last of the V RMS we have
V deem which is a two-phase and
unfortunately I don't actually have the
datasheet for this chip because that is
a monolithic power system so MPs MP 29
40 voltage controller 40 a and this
thing's really annoying like it comes up
on their search function on their
website but there's no actual and like
there's no dedicated like data sheets or
like anything about the actual chip
itself it's really weird it's like they
wanted to list it and then somebody just
decided now we're not going to put it on
our own site so that's kind of weird but
it does seem to like it is capable of
dry like it should be capable of running
a proper two-phase so this is and it
would make sense that on a motherboard
of this price point you'd have a real
two-phase memory vrm so that's your VD
right there and or VDD are depending on
what you want to call it or VDD Q if you
want to use the J deck term and the most
fits on there are still you know for c0
24 ends for the low side so massive
overkill and a for c0 29 for the high
side again from on semiconductor so
that's a really really solid memory of
erm right there and that covers it in
terms of basically everything on this
motherboard you know very very expensive
and I mean you do get a set of really
solid VR ends but I don't see
like I'm not seeing $600 worth of yarns
like just know it's but that's just not
here and even if there was $600 worth of
erm
you don't need $600 for ninety nine
hundred K not like you you like it just
doesn't make sense I know the
ninety-nine hundred K is expensive but
the this is just kind of silly the the
price tag on this motherboard is just
insane and the equipment that it comes
with doesn't really reflect that you
know it's just it's a high-end board
definitely but like I didn't know who
likes overspending on a vrm I mean it
doesn't even have an ID like it doesn't
even support the AI GPU itself like
nobody's gonna use it for extreme
overclocking just on the basis that it's
a Ford in motherboard and that's
ignoring the fact that it doesn't seem
to have all of the necessary LD O's for
extreme overclocking and then it's just
like so what where is the six hunt like
where is like the key feature of this
motherboard as far as I'm concerned
because it's like you don't have a
million PCIe lines because there's no PL
x chip there's you have a solid vrm but
you can get Solid V arms for a hell of a
lot cheaper than this so yeah I I don't
get what MSI was trying to achieve with
this right here you know it is
impressive but it's just too damn
expensive oh and on the last no MSI has
finally like said that basically all of
the capacitors scattered around this
motherboard so like these guys I assume
these guys as well are all made by
Nippon chemi-con so they call them NCC
capacitors for short but they are an
important chemical and not say Japanese
cap manufacturer they're really like
well regarded as far as like their
capacitor reliability goes and their
capacitor specs as well so this is
basically like equivalent to you're like
well say gigabyte and asrock and Asus
will use on their higher-end
motherboards is like Nietzsche koneff P
series capacitors that's basically
equivalent here with with the MSI mode
but yeah it's just like and even then
it's like these makup asset errs could
have been made out of solid gold and
diamonds and I'd still tell you like
it's just not worth it so impressive but
overpriced is ultimately what I think
about this PCB right here it's just like
I don't I don't see it where where where
where is the like I may be like I'm not
actually sure how much the TDA 200 4 6 2
s are like cost and they're probably
pretty expensive but there's better like
that still doesn't justify the price
point as far as I'm concerned like it
doesn't like it still is like you don't
need them so why so not that's it you
know that's the Z 390 godlike from MSI
it's it's a prep like it has a really
impressive 16 phase B curve erm it also
just doesn't make any sense in terms of
everything else on the motherboard
because it's just like there's a whole
lot of erm attached to not a lot of
motherboard as far as I'm concerned and
then it has a $600 price tag so that is
