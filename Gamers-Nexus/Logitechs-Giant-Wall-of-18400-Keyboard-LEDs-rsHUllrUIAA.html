on net we're here at PAX East 2016 and
i'm joined by you josh from logitech and
ken from right brain electronics who
worked together on this great wall of
logitech G keyboards behind me but
before we get to that all this coverage
brought to you by cyberpowerpc who are
awarded the reader's choice for best
desktops at pc magazine so you Josh
let's start with you you can't with this
idea six months ago as I did yeah six
months ago so basically we launched our
GA 10 actually this is before we
launched our g 8 10 which is our new RGB
mechanical keyboard said all right it's
got 16.8 million colors amador coming
nerd you know I grew up playing pacman
space invaders asteroids I'm like how
cool would it be if we built a huge wall
out of our keyboards and we like program
to video game on and I like brought
Wendy and Brent some of the other folks
in I said what do you think and they
looked at me like I was insane and so
luckily that weekend Wendy ended up
going to a show like a maker faire and
she meant Kent she's like really friends
with and she knows he works at this
company called right brain and they help
people with crazy dreams make it awesome
it gets it yeah the crazier the better
so that's that's kind of how we got
started and we brought Ken and we said
Kent what do you think so so what were
some of the things that your team did on
this so basically we took each of these
keyboards we knew is going to be 160 of
them low resolution you know it's not
supposed to be a display right so
basically we made it work with low
resolution but we H laser etched each
key so that lets more light out so that
the brain sort of sees the negative
space and fills it in and it was just
really a collaborative team effort the
guys that logitech have been great
obviously you're just as the visionary I
mean really a little little screw loose
right but it's amazing when a team comes
together in a short amount of time to do
something this big you know
is awesome think about it basically all
we did is it's the exact it's a standard
keyboard so one we we're actually
selling it here at the show floor all we
did is replace the key caps and
basically just think we're just using
every single key as if it's a pixel I'm
just lighting the pixels as if it was a
you know ginormous you know monitor so
right so what are what was one of the
main challenges you face on the software
side for this so basically we tried a
lot of off-the-shelf software that's
done to basically map video to LEDs but
this is 18,400 LEDs and they're not
regularly in space they're not a
rectilinear you know x y and so
basically we have to map the video do
these these irregular pixels and it
brought off-the-shelf standard you know
software to its knees I mean you load
the program you wait a few minutes for
the for the pile to load and then it was
like six seven frames per second it just
was not wasn't good so we just had to
write our own software and that was
really the biggest piece biggest
challenge right so very cool logitech G
keyboard here at PAX East 2016 if you
want to check it out at the Logitech
booth sort of in the middle of the show
and as always thank you for watching
