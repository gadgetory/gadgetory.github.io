some issues that GM's video editor
Andrew Coleman has been having with his
laptop so Andrew does pretty much all
the video editing for the site on our
own rigs which means I was not privy to
the fact that this is what he's dealing
with at home this is the primary system
as I understand it and it's it's not in
great shape so this is a lenovo
something i'm not do we know what model
this is how spotlessness lenovo ideapad
why 480 i'm going to be taking this
thing apart at least them in part to try
and figure out what's going on so the
issue as I understand it when running
just about anything including Windows
the system will sometimes freeze it will
exhibit frozen mouse behavior shutdowns
when rendering animations you may have
seen the CPU cooler TLDR or the 570 ex
review those both had some pretty cool
animations that we did they're made on
this system rendered on our machine in
the office but made on this system and
when that happens the CPU hits about 98
degrees Celsius should not do that and
the GPU also on 98 Celsius and the hard
drive somewhere in the high 70s which is
also pretty damn hot so we're going to
try and fix it but we'll see how that
goes before we get into the work here
this content is brought to you by our
patreon backers if you want to help us
out making behind the scenes videos or
other videos we've got the behind the
scenes video coming up for the EVGA vrm
testing then you can help us out by

below thank you to those of you who are
already supporting us there so let's get
into the content this is the Lenovo
IdeaPad Y 480 I guess as I've been as
I've just seen we're going to go ahead
and open it first mmm so um so there's
the idea bad and I've got a dust allergy
which is going to come into play here so
let's just
just kind of do the basics here so CPU
is hitting whatever 98 100 Celsius
really doesn't matter at this point
higher than t.j.maxx rule out ah I'm
sure or very damn close to it and I can
already tell what the problem is
the problem is probably all the dust I
just I would look at this thing I just
cleaned it off and it looks really
pretty good compared to where it was a
second ago ah so dust isn't great Andrew
docks the system which means it's really
never opened it's just kind of kept like
that closed all the time probably work
on the we should work on that hinge - um
oh this is important so this is the side
of the laptop you may notice that you
can see some copper sticking out of it
the plastic housing is broken here and
that copper I'm thinking may have sucked
in some of the dust we just dealt with
so I think the heart of this issue will
be thermals I guess we could go ahead
and demonstrate the issue you have like
a blender file or something I can open
we've opened up a GN logo 3d file and
blender I'm gonna hit f12 to start
rendering it and in 3 oh that is getting
loud that is some warm air coming out so
CPU that 20% load or there abouts
temperature is fluctuating 70s to 80 and
we're not doing a CPU round reading
while we're doing a GPU render GPUs on
100% load temperatures is at 82 now 83
it has climbs about 10 degrees in the
last 1 minute or so and it's still
climbing so we're going to start hitting
some thermal limits minimally on the
clock rate if not on the system being
stable so we're at 2.4 gigahertz CPU GPU
is what 885 megahertz is a GTX 650 M
I've got a thermocouple probe here k
type I'm going to touch the copperfin
this doesn't tell us anything about the
component temperature just tells us that
the heat sinks working well but if you
touched it with your hand you would be
touching
about 70 degrees Celsius of copper like
just having my hand where it is
measuring the temperature is pretty
uncomfortable so that's really more of a
fixing totally cooling by removing dust
will solve some of that but that's also
more of a the the copper is exposed and
that's what exposed copper is going to
do want it to heat sink GPUs up to 90
Celsius it's been like 40 seconds since
the last update so that's right three
minutes total we're running we're in the
90s starting to smell like burning dust
the cpu last check was like in the low
it would fluctuate 64 to 80 and now it's
fluctuating 75 to 85 I just saw 92 pop
up by 75 to 85 reliably
and that's not a CP render so that means
the GP is burning up the CPU gb is 91 92
Celsius hard drive has gained 3 degrees
it's at 47 now so if you ran this
prolonged rendering overnight or
something hard I would probably be
pretty unhappy as well okay so I think
I've seen enough it'll crash eventually
it certainly happened enough up until
this point so we don't need to duplicate
it so we'll freeze or crash GPU after
less than probably 5 minutes or
thereabouts of rendering we are at run
the 90s Celsius and CPUs approach in
that range as well so let's figure out
what we can do to fix this so I have not
worked on one of these laptops either in
a very long time or ever no I have
worked on the Lenovo but not in quite a
while
it's maybe a bit of a learning process
but shouldn't be too hard really for
those who don't know I used to do laptop
test engineering so this was part of the
day job many years ago these screws are
like cemented in there I don't know if
this is being has been shown on the
camera or not but I'm putting the screws
in a tray top of the tray for this and
I'm putting them in order so oriented
same as the laptop bottom right screw
bottom left screw that way I can
reinstall them correctly later laptops
are notoriously tricky with their screws
they often use different types and sizes
of screws and what you're working on so
it is important to document them
the crack in the bottom of this to just
connect the battery okay that's good OSU
the problem let's drive getting dust off
the stuff you do have to be careful the
tools I'm using to get dust or for
household cleaning you don't want to use
them on for example memory be better off
using just a blower can which I've also
got some generic you know department
store kind of anti-static compressed air
will do the trick you don't want to rub
ESD ready components are basically these
types of things all over sensitive
components okay so how do we get to here
this is often where companies hide tiny
screws under the CG any optical drives
and they also like to hide them under
the the feet so there's rubberized feet
but they are generally marked so you
know there's something on to them like
there's a little symbol next time like
this symbol here well but generally be
next to a foot with something under it
this one's like you already stripped out
I haven't even worked on it I'm I think
I can fit a square head screw in there I
can see all the dust is an ear fan
keyboard screw hard drive hard drive try
like once on the head that screws not
supposed to be in that hole that screws
not the right size for that hole
yeah something's holding that down just
probably that stupid thing now that's
too far off center oh we got to get this
screw out to get anywhere unfortunately
no matter what screwdriver I put in
there it's going to spin I've got like
one grab point so I've probably one good
shot before I strip it out worse I tried
the square heads and even allen keys and
they almost fit but not quite sure what
we can do with
a lot of force that screw is not going
back in there that screws going into the
garbage that's good
let's I've already improved this laptop
substantially remember help me remember
this white one goes there I don't think
it actually matters but I know it does
matter white one goes into the auxilary
white auxilary eight black maybe that
screw does have to come out just happens
to line up with heavens line up with
where the tension is on the keyboard I
want another man
oh my god there's so much dust got one
clip out this this plastic clips
again there goes a maglev fan by Sonnen
they make Corsairs maglev fans Shh how
many people know that now there's a
cable right here get out it it's a lot
of dust coming out of here onto my table
shells got like so many cracks in it
already I'm scared to apply any force to
it something uh-huh
got it sneaky friggin bastards that's
why you don't apply force figured it out
without hurting anything worse than it
already has been start working with the
topside a lot of plating a copper like
material not quite hard cop or anything
but we've got stuff to work with where
does that even situate that's all for
the contacts down here anyway so now we
got to actually start cleaning this
thing I'm going to start with non
sensitive areas so here's a look at the
main part of the problem
fans lot seized from dust but I would be
surprised with spinning that speck a lot
of dust and there even if it's been
suspect there's just so much crap it's
gonna not move as much air because the
dust is taking the place of all the air
probably going to open the window and
blow that outside I'm going to see if I
can take this shell off and if we can
take the shell off and individually
expose the fan which not all laptops
will do but some that I've worked with
have then we can individually clean out
the fan so they're out there so much
dust like even if you just look here
this is like capacitors dressed but we
can get off I clean that off it's going
to be hard to put back together
correctly
it's one of the most complex laptops
internally I've ever worked with I feel
like this is not how it originally
shipped but also that screw was not
taken out so I guess it is
you ready for the unveil here's your
problem
good news big copper heatpipes bad news
no way to dissipate the heat just take a
good look at the hat I'm thinking while
we're this far down we have cleaned this
out take these off take this off do new
thermal paste on the CPU and the GPU and
then seal it back up we're just going to
take friggin forever okay can you grab
me a paper towel and some thermal paste
it's mostly like hardened at this point
no point it's not really doing anything
the thermal pads that we're here on the
memory I have some dust in them you can
see on this one that use iasts pretty
probably but they still do something
it's just questionable why is there like
plastic covering everything in this
computer it's probably to keep dust out
but like GTX 650 M never before seen
like actually plastic
nice it's okay just like that
um it's trying to prevent metal contact
between the so okay so we're going to
skip throw pads for cost reasons I don't
want to put expensive pads on this and
it'll be fine without them anyway this
thermal compound is not Arctic cooling
compound it's actually compound I have
from a factory that I've sucked into
this tube and it's really damn good so
we're going to put that here
and we're we have we here in here and
that's it I put some compound here a
little generous someone's going to be
like when we go let's torch thermal
paste but this is a GPU folks it's fine
that's not the same as a CPU
or cover up the compound before someone
tries crimes against humanity
call let's resealed this goes like that
this connects here
you know I actually put those in right
now not gonna prevent anything
okay so this is captain tape this can
withstand about a hundred Celsius which
it's not going to get anywhere close to
that temperature but I want to put
something in this was originally held in
with adhesive I can tell because I can
look at it and see there's residue on it
so I'm going to hold it down with
probably better at heesu than what was
in there originally and it's not
electrically conductive yeah okay
that'll work well
auxiliary mean it's not stress testing
yet we're just seeing doesn't turn on
does a key word Mouse work that is not
uh-huh and it's not spinning I know I
this cable okay we've got video fan is
spinning a mouse works keyboard works
scale it back up what if I do a wheeled
it fun is Jesus okay my moment of truth
so as you can see TV temperatures are in
the sub 70 range 65 68 GPU temp is 68
steady generally it's dropping a bit
right now based on the render tasks but
spend 68 up until now hard drive is
about 44 so last time we ran this test
before tearing the whole thing down and
working on it we basically we didn't
even finish a render pass in blender and
we were already hitting thing very high
eighties we were at or around 90
this time we're at about 68 Celsius for
just a one render pass complete in
blender so that's a pretty significant
improvement even just I would have been
happier the 15,000 improvement over
Andrews reported 98 Celsius originally
I've been happy with probably had 10
Celsius improvement honestly but if
we're getting 20 then great I'm not
gonna question
it they sound this was a short pass but
it sounds like we're getting at least 20
15 20 C improvement maybe more depending
on how this functions when there's like
a longer burnin period CPU temps also
about 20 C improvement hard drive was in
the 40s so that was fine too
the only reason that would heat up is
because it's sort of sandwiched between
the hotter components overall looks good
the fan is working better I can actually
feel air coming out of the side now
rather than heat just radiating out of
it haha
the copper heatsink alone is cooler
about six or seven degrees and obviously
again not a measurement of performance
but the fact that the copper heat sinks
cooler means the fan is actually pushing
air through it and dissipating the heat
that it collects or conduct so I think I
can call this a success looks like
minimally cleaning the fan probably did
about all of the work but new thermal
paste does not hurt that was a good
thermal paste to the stuff that was on
there's basically plastic so not bad
overall laptop went together exactly how
it came apart I've damaged on the little
prying tool ensured that none of the
edges got chipped which I've certainly
done in the past when I was new word to
pulling laptops apart where you start
prying it up with like a flathead and
you really screw up that plastic finish
on the the shell that didn't happen here
so we use proper tools so pretty sweet I
am I guess as a value-add pretty happy
with this tool kit too but that's when I
actually paid for so I got a bias
because I paid for it and I want it to
be good but it actually is pretty good
for this task
so patreon like postal video if you want
to helps out directly or in this case
help people like Andrew improve their
computer significantly with a few mods
