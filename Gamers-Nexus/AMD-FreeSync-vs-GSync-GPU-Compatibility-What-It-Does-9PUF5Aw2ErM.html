tonight still at CES 2015 we have a
bunch of coverage on all online already
all this coverage brought to you by
cyber power and the new cyber vapor
gaming PC this is Andy's freesync
technology we saw this at CES last year
it's finally here it's a few weeks away
and free sync is unlike g-sync it's a
totally free effectively Hardware les
design it's sort of like flipping a bit
in the display most of the display panel
manufacturers are supporting free sync
now about 95% of them so it's looking
good for the tech and we can see it here
with this windmill display which is what
was on display last year it's just been
amped up a bit and then there's also a
tomb raider display that will be rolling
in for you so the main thing with free
sync is like G sync it is eliminating
tearing and stuttering vsync we
generally recommend in our game guides
to disable because it's introducing
stuttering and in a lot of cases we'd
prefer tearing tearing looks like this
where your your get it looks like the
textures are sort of lagging behind what
our frame rate is with free sync on the
display is slaving to the GPU
so it's an adaptive refresh rate and
with it off
we're hitting in the instance of this 60
Hertz monitor the the monitor is
expecting a frame from the GPU every 16
milliseconds so if the GPU misses that
mark then you're displaying a frame
again and that's where where we get the
issues one item of note with free sync
as opposed to gsync is that it will be
compatible if you run a non-native
resolution on the display and there
aren't a lot of use cases for this but
in htpc environments you might want to
run a lower than native resolution
because from a far back distance you
don't want the text and things like that
to be too small and it'll still look
fine on 720 so freesync is compatible in
that use case scenario in terms of video
card support it's compatible with
effectively every current AMD GPU and
current apu but it is not compatible
with e2 70 or 280 the chip is current
gen but the display controller is last
gen so 270 and 280 will not be
supporting freesync but the next gen is
expected to support it other than that
panel support and display support it
works on 1440 at 144 Hertz it works on
4k at 6
Hertz 2560 ultra-wide 2560 by 1080 is
compatible as well so you've got every
monitor resolution refresh rate and most
the GPS there's a marginal price
increase for testing and validation
reasons but we're told that it should
not be quite as big a jump as g-sync is
and we'll follow up with coverage on
that so that is free sink check the link
in the description below for more
coverage on this and I will see you all
next time
