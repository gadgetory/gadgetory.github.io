not need to exist they already have the
r6 and it's pretty much the same case
and stand alone the s2 is fine in a
vacuum it's fine it's a good case but
when you compare it to fractals existing
r6 it gets a bit more confusing as to
why they even bothered to make the s2
because there aren't that many changes
it's the same tooling and we'll go
through the changes in this review but
at $150 MSRP for each one street price
between 100 and 150 for the hard six it
is a little bit odd that this wasn't
just a straight upgrade kit for the r6
before that this video is brought to you
by EVGA r-tx 20 atti XC ultra video card
we recently used this to beat our
founders edition overclocking results
with its additional power target
headroom and cooling capabilities the XC
Ultra uses a 2.7 extra thick heatsink
for quiet operation under low loads but
also maintains higher clocks on average
over the FE model learn more at the link
in the description below we have a lot
of notes on these cases so let's go
through them piece by piece the r6 we
previously reviewed and reviewed it
actually pretty positively the primary
difference on the front end is that the
front panel on this one opens it's
hinged on both sides you can swap it
around it's got a five and a quarter bay
on the front and it has a dust filter
down here and you can just remove the
entire dust filter if you wanted to
assuming you had reach to it which I do
not presently and the difference is on
the new case the s2 instead of a hinged
panel instead of a dust filter that's
very easily removable they've changed it
to a non hinged front panel right there
it does not open they've increased the
gap on the side intake so there's
actually a bit more space here now than
previous and we'll talk about the
specificity of that later and have added
in a fine filter only on the sides
there's no more filter directly in front
of the fan so no more of this if you
want to clean out the filter now you
have to clean out the sides whether you
vacuum it or just remove the whole front
panel run underwater that's up to you
but the panel is no longer him so that's
a big difference once you get past that
the fans
are a bit higher up on the s2 we'll talk
about this in the thermal and cooling
section than they are in the rs6
on the front of the case the front
inside of the case the difference is
primarily come down to this drive
structure which is gone in the s2 and as
a very quick side note and attention to
detail note here the branding of the
logo has moved as well so if you wanted
to get rid of this previously it was on
this piece and you could easily pull it
out whereas now it's permanently on the
power splash ride but not a big deal
there so the whole front drive support
structures gone on this case and
previously here's the thing it's not
like it wasn't part of the chassis in
this one it was not structurally welded
or riveted to the frame or anything like
that you could remove this you can move
the plate back even and get functionally
the same case here to be fair the s2
does come with some reservoir support
mounts right here so it adds a bit of
water cooling support but this isn't
anything you couldn't have made work on
the r6 on your own and they could have
made an adapter kit for the r6 and sold
it separately instead of an entire new
SKU as well so that's a bit odd but
reservoir support is probably one of the
bigger notes on this case versus the
previous one I live in that though I
mean you can fit three hard drives in
there on the backside still you still
have access the support so you lose
about half the hard drive support as you
have here you lose five and a quarter
support which for the most part whatever
but some people might care about that it
is kind of an unnecessary loss though so
that's been odd and and then that's more
or less it the the r6 can do everything
this does in terms of layout it can be
an open layout case now moving back
further the entire motherboard chassis
components is all the same so twins all
the same there the power supply shroud
in the front you can pop out the front
hole and allow support for a bigger
radiator again there's a hole here as
well not only different there at the top
of the case there's still this button we
complained about this button before and
we pull out some footage of it but
there's a button in the back and we
complain about it because it's a cool
it's such a cool idea but when you push
it it doesn't have the mechanical
response that makes sense which we need
to pop up the panel enough that you can
then simply
pull it out instead it pops it up so
that if you have really long fingernails
or a screwdriver they you can probably
get it out but the easier way to do it
is to use the pop mechanism and then
reach inside of the case this one
doesn't even come up that much and push
it out so I mean once you're reaching
inside the case to push it out what is
the point it's it's a cool feature it's
a cool idea it is so poorly implemented
and that's one of our bigger problems
with this it's something that we've even
complained about before but because it's
clearly the same tool and it's the same
case it was in this this was an easy
product for fractal to make they did not
change very much at all so they didn't
go out make new tools at least for the
most part so I guess it makes sense that
they wouldn't have addressed this
particularly concerning because they
didn't really redo anything but it is
sort of annoying to see a feature that
is otherwise kind of cool oh go to waste
and by the way while I have this out
this filter so if you're laughing about
a filter attached to a solid block of
material you can actually separate them
and run just the filter on the top we
have some thermal tests of that as well
so if you want to get rid of the what
they call the mod you vent cover on top
you could do so to separate the filter
from the vent the the panel though is
kind of a pain you should be able to do
it by hand but in reality you should be
using a flathead to pry a bit because
it's pretty stuck in there so another
Dane for fractal on usability of the
case with the way that was implemented
in its entirety that whole top panel
needs to be redesigned the back of the
case more less famous you still have one
fan here yourself two in the front no
differences in terms of fan count to the
r6 previously and vertical mount still
there all that stuff nothing's really
changed so then what's different is
again when you buy the s2 you get less
you're spending the same money as I'm a
sharpie or more than street price with
r6 you're getting less metal you're
getting fewer Drive options because it's
again you can take this out if you
really wanted to in the old case it kind
of adds reservoir support but again
there you could definitely make a
reservoir fit in this case in a way that
doesn't look bad either so it's kind of
weird it's everything that's been done
to this case seems I could just be like
you just sell that front panel and sell
these two metal rails and make them fit
that case and it kind of seems like
you're done
I don't know that needs to be a whole
skew on its own but we're not saying the
case is bad
so the Defiant s2 is fine as a case and
you'll see this as we go through the
review all Patrick's building that's all
the thermal review it's a good case it
is objectively good build quality it's
we liked the r6 we liked the s2 for the
same reason it's just that again the
fact that it's good is separate from the
fact that it does not need to be here
and it's odd as a different skewed it
just seems like it seems like more of a
marketing decision than an engineering
one or well I guess it's probably just a
marketing decision but it could have
come down to we need another SKU the
holidays are coming up what do we do
there's an idea let's change the front
panel so I don't know it's the case is
fine but let's go through the build
notes and cover the rest of it then get
into thermals and noise the main
differences from the r6 are the hard
drive mounts and all the other parts
associated with the front panel the rear
two-thirds of the case are identical
between the r6 and s2 at least as far as
we can tell even the front panel itself
is almost the same on the outside but
the s2 lacks the hinge door of the r6
that's because there are no front filter
intakes like the one on the r6 instead
the vents on the side of the front panel
are covered with too much smaller
filters this has interesting
implications for air flow because as
we've mentioned in the past placing a
filter directly over the fans can reduce
their advocacy it's a cool idea but it's
also much harder to remove the filters
from the s2 since it requires taking the
whole front panel off instead of just
opening the door there should rarely be
any reason to remove them anyway since
they could easily be cleaned from the
inside of the case if you had to the
width of the front vents on the s2 is
also subtly different mark that just
under 2.5 centimeters
compared to the r6 is 2 centimeters
fractal design has been putting some
thought into thermal performance overall
and we'll discuss the results of our
testing later in this review perhaps
unfortunately removing the front door of
the case also removes any possibility of
installing a five and a quarter inch
drive which is a
these days and so it's a bit of a niche
market to try and fill the s2 reclaims
those extra centimeters instead for more
fan mounting space furthered with fewer
3.5 inch drives in the s2 than the r6 a
lot fewer which is probably the most
obvious difference against the r6 the r6
dedicated its entire front third to a
tower of horizontal universal drive
brackets hidden behind a steel shield
with 12 available slots and six brackets
included in the case the s2 has done
away with that completely or rather it
looks like it has which we'll touch on
in just a moment instead of all those
drive brackets there are three three and
a half inch mounts behind the
motherboard tray now that's still more
than many mid towers but not nearly as
impressive instead of the tower drive
mounts the s2 has open air and a
removable cover over the now empty hole
and the power splash shroud that should
mean better air flow but the drive tower
was removable in the r6 so the optional
power supply shroud cover is the only
additional feature in this area the
power supply shroud is riveted and
unremovable like the R 6 while the top
radiator or fan mounts is removable also
like the r6
so this is where fractal is getting away
from what made the our six unique having
more drives for example focusing a bit
on silence being a smaller case with a
lot of drive support and even having a 5
in quarter and going towards more of
what everyone else is doing with the s2
the screw holes for the drive brackets
are actually still there though but
they're used to attach the forward
portion of the motherboard tray instead
this is exactly the same as switching to
the quote open layout of the r6 by
moving the hard drive mounting plate to
the other side of the case except
there's no other layout in the s2 so
it's almost a straight downgrade what
we're trying to articulate here is that
the chassis is literally the same as the
r6 at least almost entirely the same
just has different attachments screwed
into it and we could unscrew and swap
parts to fully convert our s2 into an r6
and vice versa - the five and a quarter
inch bay that's cool from the
perspective that fractal is offering an
additional variants of a popular case
but it makes it even weirder that this
is a distinct product on its own kale
management was already very good in the
r6 and is slightly better here since the
full-length power supply
and motherboard tray hide cables even
more effectively front panel connections
will get a little Messier if all three
hard drive bays are filled of course
since the wires will have to be routed
between them rather than through them
but it's an extremely easy case to work
with overall and the build quality as
with the r6 is still high wonderful a
new feature is the slots for a reservoir
mounts on the inside of the case these
allow reservoir clips to be mounted in
the spot formerly occupied by the drive
brackets that's where the bigger change
happens so you're going for water
cooling this might be a better
consideration than the r6 for more
thoughts on the layout of this case
though check our fractal r6 review
because it's the same thing mostly and
so the opinions also apply here
including those pertaining to build
quality
moving on to thermal and noise testing
now for additional testing this time we
tried taking the steel plate off the top
mod you vent and taking the front panel
off we didn't bother doing a vertical
GPU test because we already did that
and the r6 and because Fraxel doesn't
include a riser cable so it's not really
an intended use anyway at least for an
eric welds card we've also beaten the
vertical GPU thing to death at this
point and so we'll refer you to the r6
is vertical mount for those thoughts
we're focusing on testing with fractals
three stock fans in the s2 today and as
always you can check the article linked
in the description below for Patrick's
written review and for our testing
methodology if you're curious how we do
these tests we're starting with only the
two relevant fractal cases and then
we'll move on to comparative charts
average CPU temperature and torture
testing was fifty six point nine degrees
Celsius over ambient when stock which
improves a few degrees to fifty three
point one degrees delta T over ambient
with the steel plate removed from the
top of the case with everything stocked
but the front panel completely removed
CBO temperature was vastly lower and
averaged 44 degrees adjusting the event
size and the placement of the front
filter was movement in the right
direction but the front panel is clearly
still a huge obstacle to the fans
performance of course this impacts the
noise as well but we'll talk about that
a bit later the stock r6 placed within
margin of error of being exactly the
same as the s2 but one point eight
degrees better in the open layout
presumably due to the large gap in the
power supply shroud which we left
covered in the s2 we feel comfortable
saying that the stock CPU temperature is
the same in the two cases
despite changes to the front panel the
s2 actually tactically beat the r6 is
cpu result by 1.5 degrees Celsius with
no front panel at all since the fans are
placed slightly higher in the s2 because
of the absence of a five and a quarter
bay that said 1.5 degrees is about
margin of error compared to some other
cases here similarly price the options
in the $150 class would include the
eight 709 I but same idea for
performance and the H 500 P mesh
alongside the Lian leo 11 air these are
of course very different and how they
look and their goals but they are about
the same price so if you're open to
different types of cases they'd be good
considerations with the mod you vent
cover removed the s2 lands right around
where the defined sea with extra fans
performed or the NZXT h 700 would
perform the age 500 P mesh is measurably
ahead but also an extremely different
case with a much different look and goal
and that goal is more airflow oriented
than fractals s2 is so it might not even
work for your needs GPU torture testing
is next GB tortured temperature was 59
degrees stock and that's again delta T
over ambient not significantly lower
with the top vent open and it measured
about fifty five point one degrees
Celsius delta theory' a minute with the
front panel completely removed in this
test at least it seems like the front
panel isn't the biggest obstacle to
cooling and instead the rearrangement of
intake fans has more to do with how air
is delivered not abnormal really the
stock layout of the s2 is again slightly
warmer than the comparable open layout
of the r6
which can be put down to the gap in the
shroud so the two can be considered more
or less equivalent the r6 maintained its
advantage this time in the test without
any front panel which makes sense again
because of the slightly lower fan
placement and vertical GPU placement is
absolutely not recommended unless you
using an open-loop card as illustrated
by the r6 here no need to do that again
with the s2 it's the same thing
comparatively the s2 lands toward the
lower third of the pack around where the
r6 originally performed the case is more
silence driven than performance driven
so we won't criticize its thermal
performance too heavily we need the
context of its acoustic performance
coming up momentarily to really
understand how it does as measured here
in the comparative chart the
two is overall below average and it's
cooling capabilities and not all that
impressive so we'll see if it makes it
up elsewhere build quality's fine ease
of installation is more or less perfect
to work with it's just the thermals are
not impressive so we need to look to
noise after we get through the rest of
the charts fire strike extreme is next
this is a realistic workload that
emulates gameplay allowing insight into
performance under real gaming conditions
rather than torture workloads GPU
temperature during our fire strike
extreme test was fifty nine point four
degrees Celsius over ambient almost
exactly the same as during the power
virus torture test it's also just 0.1
degrees different from the stock r6
which is well within our margin of error
and the two cases are functionally
identical on performance for this
benchmark including in CPU thermals
again the s2 ends up toward the bottom
end of the results chart for this one
blender CPU rendering is next providing
another realistic workload rendering our
monkeyhead test image on the CPU raise
temperature to 36.8 degrees celsius over
ambient also just 0.1 degrees different
from the stock r6 so again the same
that's way within margin of error
thermals are towards the top third in
this chart so it's looking a bit better
for this one but it's also a way less
stressful test and this is CPU targeted
rendering on the GPU for blender raised
temperature to 32 degrees over ambient
widening the gap with the r6 which
averaged nearly three degrees cooler in
this test although not that distant
overall both of these tests were done in
stock configuration which means a big
gap in the power supply shroud for the
r6 but not the s2 and the fan placement
differences that's where our difference
emerges we measured noise as well so for
knows the define s2 placed at about
thirty five point eight DBA and the RF
six was at thirty two point eight DBA
the difference is not within really
audible range for most people most
people detect about a 3 DB difference if
at all and even the thirty five point
eight DBA results is good for a case
with three stock fans in it as compared
to the rest of those on this chart
there's nothing about the s2 that should
make it any noise ear or quieter than
the r6 then maybe some slight variation
due to the front filter placement
including that we don't dislike the s2
but there doesn't seem to be a
compelling
argument to buy it over the rf6 there
are 16 skews of the r6 listed on
fractals website 16 it has more
flexibility in terms of the number and
types of drives that are installed it
cost about the same as the s2 the
advancements that fractile has made our
focus on Cooley and especially liquid
cooling but it's still not really an
ideal case in that department either
building a system with a 360 millimetre
radiator and then stick it in a case
with an unventilated panel is sort of a
strange choice other than to make up for
the lack of ventilation I guess by using
a bigger radiator fractals own mesh fic
is cheaper and we think makes more sense
in a lot of these scenarios and as a
note this isn't discussed a lot if you
think about noise if the whole point of
this if Fraggle comes back and says well
but noise but it's quieter it's quieter
than a case with like the metruff I see
no because with the case like the match
up I see which even doesn't have the
best front panel the world either but
it's better than a lot of the others you
still you get enough just airflow
passing through there you can run the
fans quieter and there goes your noise
so a lot of the time it's an interesting
toss-up where companies are trying to do
acoustics versus performance and it
doesn't have to be they don't have to be
opposing if you have good performance
you can get decent acoustics with better
tuned fans with better fan placement
with smarter front panel design so
that's not a good argument for anything
really but doesn't have to be a high
performance case we talk about
filtration and air flow a lot this case
does not try to be that it doesn't
advertise itself as a high airflow case
so we're not going to knock it too hard
for that it's just that the improvements
made to this case are centered around in
large part the front panel and those
include improving access to air it's
just that in reality the differences
really aren't compelling so he's not
enough to not buy the r6 instead and the
measure by sea is still a very good
option if you want a case that's cheaper
and similar things to this just in some
ways better so the strengths of both the
r6 and the s2 or that they're well built
they're visually clean and they're not
overly expensive cases that are they're
still good candidates
housing a normal gaming PC so again we
don't dislike the case we just think
it's the same thing as the r6 that we
already have the parts that make them
different are removable and
interchangeable and fax will could sell
the s2 as a conversion kit for the r6 if
they wanted to
so as Patrick says in his written review
linked below at any given time if you
have the question which one is better
the answer is also a question it's which
one is cheaper and just buy that one so
that's the r6 and the s2 it's fine it
just it doesn't need to be here
