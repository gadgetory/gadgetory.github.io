1660 and technically the one we tested
is an EVGA 1660 but and I'm sorry Jacob
but we're in MSI headquarters so Emma
sighs the backdrop for this they also
have 1660s we're gonna be looking at the
1660 performance today stock and
overclocked versus primarily the 1660 ti
versus the rh 590 Vega 56 and basically
every other card at nearby in the stack
so today's focus is on Nvidia's new $220
price floor video card the gtx 1660
before that this video is brought to you
by the coarser 1i 140 compact gaming PC
the Corsair 1i 140 is a small
form-factor PC outfitted with a 9700 K
RT x 28 e 32 gigabytes of RAM and a 480
gigabyte nvme SSD all housed within a 2
millimeter thick aluminum chassis the
Corsair 1i 140 is a 12 liter system fit
for desktop use with the same size I 160
counterpart with higher-end parts learn
more at the link in the description
below MSRP for the 1660 is tactically
about $220 that's the price floor and
video sets but the partner model we're
looking at is going to be about 250 for
the EVGA 1660 dual fan that we reviewed
these were checking the price on will
put them in a title card on the screen
if we get them in time so this is the
gaming x16 60 from MSI there's also an
armorer 1660 which should be the cheaper
version probably but armor OC and one
thing that we learned in the process of
tests in the 1660 was that if you get a
model like we tested with a higher power
target the overclocking Headroom will
actually allow you to bring the 1660 up
in performance to about 1660 TI stock
levels which is very interesting because
it's it's a study and buying one price
to your cheaper of a component and then
you just put maybe 20 minutes of manual
effort into it and it becomes the next
price class up so if you start at a 240
250 dollar price point for or 1616 on Ti
and then overclock it you get to about
the same performance levels as a 1660 ti
stock card at the $280 price floor which
will probably have a like a 130 watt
maximum board power so and and the 1660
that we tested
also gets up to about 130 watt board
power and and will look into these MSI
ones later perhaps so let's get straight
into the charts Patrick ran all the
tests for us we're remote we're still in
China but we're almost done here and he
ran the tests we have thermals power and
gaming to look at today and then we'll
talk conclusions and if it's worth the
money especially at the $250 boosted
price point of EVGA is dual fan card
that we're looking at today apex legends
is still new to our charts and not as
heavily populated with cards as our
later games this one is important for
its relevance but also because it's
built atop a modified Source engine with
DirectX 11 as the API giving us a title
that represents performance on much of
the games on the market we retested the
1660 Ti in this game but we haven't yet
retested all of the other cards recent
updates have improved performance on the
1660 TI n AF x legend so this is Nvidia
driver side we also need to revisit some
others later once we're home from China
will use our multiplayer test course
that we heavily detailed in our previous
content tested first at 1080p this test
placed the GTR x16 60 at 90 FPS average
with high settings or 101 fps when
overclocked for reference the 1660 TI XC
stock performance was about 99 FPS
average stock or about 102 FPS average
went overclocked we did not see much
performance uplift or scaling with the
1616 TI's overclocking apex Legends
after the update at least we didn't see
as much as before when we first tested
the game and some of this we'll look at
again in 1440p we tested this a total of
three separate times including full
driver wipe spore validation and
confirmed this performance all of those
times the 1660 was the closest to the TI
and apex legends with most other games
showing 13 to 17 percent performance
advantage stock to stock between the two
the rx vagin 56 card for reference ended
up at about 106 FPS average with the RX
590 card at about 89 FPS average tested
at 1440p the 1660 stock card still
pulled about 61 FPS average although
Loza started dragging behind
performance is reasonable and the game
can be played at about 1440p even with
this card it's just that the settings
should probably be dropped slightly to
better accommodate heavy combat areas
and the initial drop in the 1660 ti for
what it's worth was that about 68 FPS
average posting a lead of around 11
percent over the 1616 on TI overclocked
in the 1660 got it 272 FPS average which
is where the 1660 T IOC landed the two
are within margin of error cyber elite 4
is still our best example if we could
DirectX 12 implementation we tested this
one with both 1080p and 4k resolution
but please note that the 4k testing is
meant to be treated as more of a
synthetic representation of performance
from card to card because we have so
many cards on the chart it's easy to
make those comparisons this is done
because 4k gives us a full range of
performance without CPU bottlenecks at
the top end of the stack so we can
compare the cards all to each other
without any performance limitations from
the game engine side starting with the
more synthetic 4k workload the GTX 1660
posted 39 FPS average with low is very
close by at 34 fps 1% and 33 FPS 0 1%
these are pretty consistent overall
comparatively the GTX 1660 TI XE under
stock conditions posted 45 FPS average
or a lead of about 16% over the GTX 1660
the 1660s outperformed marginally by the
RX 590 which held a lead of a few FPS
average and is not too dissimilar from
the gtx 1066 here by its 37 FPS average
overclocking the 1660 to 169 hertz
offset got at 245 PS average matching
the performance of the gtx 660ti stock
card roughly matching the rx 590 Fatboy
overclocked results of 46 FPS average
and allowing the 2060 stock card a lead
of 24% moving on to 1080p testing the
GTX 1660 pushed at 110 FPS average stock
allowing the 1660 TI XC a lead of about
14% the RX 590 fat boy ended up at 120
FPS average pushing closer to the 1660
TI than the 1660 in this title sniper is
compute-intensive
and allows AMD to leverage its
architecture more than most other games
do overclocking the 1660 got it to 126
FPS average marking it as equivalent to
the stock 1660 TI XE and within margin
of error it also allowed the card to
outperform the RFI
ninety overclock but this is
insignificant beyond declaring that the
two can be made to be equal the rough to
FPS difference can't really be called
observably better although it is
measurable but it can certainly show a
minimum of equal performance everyone
2018 is next for this one tested first
at 1080p the GTX 1660 90 I ended up at
92 FPS average with lows at about 50 fps
and 31 FPS for 1% in 0.1 percent lows
respectively the performance allowed the
1660 TI XC elite of about 13.7 percent
overclocking the 1660 to a 160 megahertz
offset pushed it to 104 FPS average
which is the exact same performance we
got out of the 1660 TI XC even the lows
are roughly identical sure overclocking
the 1660 TI gets another 5 FPS average
but at some level it may be better to
step down to a 1660 and settle for TI
baseline performance and keep in mind
too that the 1660 TR we tested had a TDP
of 130 watts or 10 mobs over stock but
it did not have any power offset
allowance unlike some of the other cards
like the 1616 on TI that we're reviewing
today if you wanted 1660 TI stock
performance the 1660 could be purchased
and overclocked for the same performance
level unless money Vega 56 hid 115 FPS
average when stock for reference with
the rx 598 gigabyte card holding at 82
FPS average one stock and just to
clarify there saying for reference means
for your reference not necessarily with
the reference card the Vega 56 and rx
590 cards ran tighter frame time
consistency than Nvidia does in this
game with Vega 56 advantage to a point
of low frame time performance averaging
to about 60 FPS 0.1% lows whereas these
16 60 TI and 1660 both said in the 30s
at 1440p the 1616 on TI operated at 70
FPS average giving the 16 60 TI elite
about 10 FPS average or about 14% once
again overclocking ties things up
between the OC 16 60 and the stock 16 60
TI
the 16 60 is fully capable of playing at
f1 2018 at 1440p and could be made more
consistent in frame times with some
settings tweaks performance is about at
the same level of the gtx 1070 stock
card when overclocked and better than a
1060
six gigabyte and also not too distant
from an overclocked archetype 90 which
is no relax for arch 580 which is an
overclock to our X 480 far cry 5 is next
at 1080p the GTX 1660 ran an 81 FPS
average of putting it as the closest in
performance to an overclocked rx 590 and
allowing the GTX 16 60 TI stock card a
lead of about 13 FPS average over 16%
this is consistent with other results
Vega v6 maintained a strong lead over
both the ti and obviously the non TI for
this game but pricing also structures
the 56 and 1660 at much different price
glasses the 1662 overclocked planted it
once again at TI level performance at
1440p the 1660 card stock still managed
to nearly hit the magical 60fps mark
that everyone wants and is close enough
that it could be made to work reasonably
well at 1440p with some settings tweaks
at 56 FPS average and 64 FPS average
when overclocked the card nearly hit 16
60 TI performance even at the higher
resolutions the gtx 980ti was also
roughly tied with the overclocked 16 64
reference with the stock rx 590 ending
up functionally tied with the gtx 1660
shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080p plays
16 60 stock performance at about 74 FPS
average allowing the 16 60 TI a lead
with its 85 FPS average or about 15%
once again this lead is consistent with
other titles and seems to be about the
average percentage increase overclocking
the 1660 with the 160 mega Hertz offset
allowed it to match the 16 60 TI stock
card which then climbed another couple
FPS when it too was overclock the 1660
OC performed about where the gtx 1070 is
with the stock gtx 1660 at about rx 590
performance including that lows that
were within margin of error or close
enough at 1440p the gtx 1660 fell 250
FPS average roughly tied with the RX 5
90s 51 FPS average and low performance
is within a margin of error of the RX
590 the 16 60 T I ended up 14% ahead of
the GTX 1660 with in range of our
previously potted differences while the
16 60 OC pushed it up to 1660 T I
actually stock performance
the 1660 TI XE overclocked permitted
another 5% performance over stock but
the 1660 overclocked permitted 15
percent performance uplift this massive
headroom is what allowed for the tie
making performance note however that the
gtx 1660 were reviewing has power target
increase availability or allowance of
about 23 percent whereas the 1660 TI XC
reviewed at the low end of the price
stack remained capped at 130 YTD p about
the same as what our 1660 was doing and
130 watts is still 8 percent higher than
the stock 120 watt reference TDP of a
1660 TI the 1660 TI XE if it also had a
23 percent performance allowance power
allowance could be pushed a little bit
further and would increase the gap that
you're seeing here it's just that for
these two cards the 1616 on TI can be
made to match the ti up until a point of
overclocking with minor differences
emerged finally for the GTA 5
performance at 1080p the gtx 1660 ended
up at 85 FPS average allowing the 16 60
TI oxyelite of about 10 FPS average or
about 13 percent overclocking as the
last several charts katli 1662 about
same performance as the 1660 TI XE stock
card the RX 590 ended up far behind here
with Vega 56 also stuck at lower
performance levels then seen in other
titles relative to the Nvidia cards the
way GTA 5 is built tends to favor and
video devices which isn't for any reason
aside from how much compute is used in
each game and so the 1660 does favorably
here 1440p plates to the 1660 stock are
dead at 60 FPS average but it's frame
time performance became more variable
and dropped to about 32 FPS here 1%
close some settings reductions would be
recommended to improve frame timing
consistency
although the card is overall capable of
running GTA 5 at 1440p with these
settings overclocking pushed it to 70
FPS average or about the same as the
1660 TI XC once again and about the same
as the vegam 56 red dragon card from
power color for that overclocked we've
been showing Patrick Stump the card up
to its maximum power target and saw
performant old consistently at nineteen
thirty five megahertz with few dips
between this is often rare
and it's a result of power limitation
and positions restricting clocks as the
frequency bounces off of that power
limit but with no core offset applied
and just the power limit increased the
clock becomes consistent and holds
steady this remains true at 100
megahertz offset where we're still not
hitting a power limitation skipping a
few steps we saw crashes at 175
megahertz
offset on this card and so settled on
160 megahertz with a 15 mega Hertz
increment being about the minimum
stamping that can be applied to Nvidia
cards at 20 70 megahertz there's not
much to be mad at with this car 20 70 is
a strong frequency to hold for a
mid-range video card memory ended up had
about 24 80 mega Hertz we often stick
closer to 400 500 megahertz offset for
gddr5 we didn't see any performance
decay in games with this 960 offset the
memory is good enough on this device the
one that we tested and holds these
higher clocks with that issue you'll
sometimes see soft memory errors with
this type of offset but in the games we
tested those didn't impact performance
if they occurred it may be more of a
concern with professional applications
although we doubt many people are using
a 1660 with those types of applications
so overall the overclocking on this card
was good it was good enough to make it
into a 16-6 TTI a stock when running
with that overclocked power consumption
testing is done at the wall but uses
heavily controlled test benches for
accurate tests run to run we're looking
at a total system power consumption in
this test so it's not the individual
card power the gtx 1660 peaked at about
258 watts
total system power consumption 1 stock
averaging closer to 200 watts total
system power draw our 1660 tea I saw
about the same power consumption for
reference but keep in mind that partner
model cards can change power target
beyond reference total board power
provided by Nvidia spec table which is
what happened here the RX 590 for
further reference plotted at about 325
watts peak power consumption and
remained more consistent in its higher
power draw whereas the Nvidia cards will
power throttle more aggressively during
testing the RX 590 ended up about 70 to
120 watts higher than nvidias 16 series
power consumption depending on the
thermal torture testing though is up
next
under stock Auto conditions the EVGA
1660 that we tested kept a thermal
target of about sixty degrees Celsius
illustrated by the thermal overtime plot
holding steady at sixty see this had a
fan ramping to about eighteen hundred
rpm against its maximum fan speed on the
cooler of 3500 rpm and we allow this to
be automatically controlled so we're
letting the BIOS on the card dictate the
fan speed which allows us to see how it
performs and what's thermal targets are
out of the box thermally the GPU does
well and the fan rpm could be manually
run at a less aggressive curve if lower
noise were desired rather than lower
thermals so what she over to the
frequency chart we see one of the most
impressive frequency lines we've ever
plotted versus a results of the lower
thermal target that kept this card under
sixty degrees Celsius for the duration
of this particular test the card
operated at about 19 20 megahertz
constantly when under stock conditions
and with our 3d mark fire strike extreme
fixed workload this illustrates good
thermal performance of the cooler and
that were not bouncing off of major
power limits under stock conditions 1660
positioning then after all the charts
after you've seen all the game
performance it ends up we're at the $250
price point the card is it's obviously a
replacement for the 1066 gigabyte
clearly and it's a decent replacement at
that it's a competitor to some extent
with the RX 590 which is about the same
price plus or minus maybe 40 bucks
depending on the model and for the RX
590 to really compete well it needs to
come down in price closer to the 1660
overclocked models are the ones that are
easily overclocked anyway like the one
we had so all right 590 is in a bit of a
rough spot right now performance wise
the 590 we'd like to see it closer to
the to $20 range depending and there
might be some out there at this point
remember that prices on launch of cards
the competitors of those cards will
often change the prices so you might see
the 590 come down a bit by the time this
review goes up and we'll double check
and see if that is the case an update
News video what we think of so but 590
needs to come down a bit to be truly
competitive 56 we'd like to see stay in
the 282 maybe $310 price range at that
price range 56 is a really good deal but
it's often more than that and that's
where the 1660 Ti starts to look really
good especially the 280 our price floor
for that one so 1660 really where it
shines we think is if you buy something
like the dual fan models maybe like one
of these ones in the background here the
armor or gaming extra something like it
depending on where the price is if it's
in the 242 maybe 260 range and you put
20 minutes of work into overclocking it
you can get it up to 1660 TI performance
when it's stocked so that's really not
bad if you're willing to put in a couple
minutes of work you can save about 30
bucks off the top of the 1660 TI price
and for people who are on a really
strict budget the 1660 does well in
those instances so that's gonna be it
for a look right now the 1660 does fine
it's gddr5 so it's a bit different but
performance wise once you kind of match
the clocks it's not all that different
in gaming because a lot of the games are
more frequency bound on the core than
they are bandwidth bound on the memory
which is what we saw today on our gaming
test where the 1660 brings up
performance to 1660 TI class so that's
it for now we'll be home soon and do
some more testing on these 16 to 60
cards once we get back thank you for
