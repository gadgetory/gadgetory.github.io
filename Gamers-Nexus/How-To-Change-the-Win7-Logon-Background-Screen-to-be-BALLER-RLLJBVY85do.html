net and today we're going to do a pretty
sweet tutorial on something really basic
you see it every day you see it when you
hit ctrl delete if you have Windows 7
that is your logon screen / ctrl delete
screen as just it's that screen that
it's the green and white ugly green
white blue windows 7 default one that
you have right now here's what it looks
like and basically we're going to change
that because it doesn't look like a
gamer screen so we're going to change
that we can do it the starcraft dirt 3
whatever you can change it to your own
screenshots that you've taken if you
want to and its really simple we're just
going to use a tool that is called the
windows 7 logon changer or a window 7
log on background change or 13.4 excuse
me and I put the link below to download
so go to the description to download
that program once you download it pretty
simple it's a zip file just right click
and extract it depending on if you have
when raw or not these options will be
different so I will extract it to
windows seven log on background change
or one point three point four then click
on its subsequent folder because I don't
want to say that name again and we just
go right here to win 7 you get the idea
XE double click it it launches just like
that pretty simple here is what you'll
probably see unless you have a different
theme not a huge deal if you do it's
really easy to change regardless so once
you see this we're ready to go get a
picture for you to change to your
background let's do that right now let's
grab i already have dirt 3 and i already
have starcraft 2 so let's grab a what's
a good screenshot guys let's go with the
skyrim wallpaper or something like that
something really easy let's grab a
skyrim one who that looks pretty nice so
as far as this goes as long as it is a
reasonable resolution it should work i
have not tried anything too large but as
long as it's under by 19 by 10 which is
1080p it'll work just fine
if it's too small it'll be a little bit
strange looking you know stretched and
all that so let's grab this one right
now and just throw that in my custom
desktop folder put it in whatever folder
you want this is where I'm saving all my
desktop stuff so we'll put right there
save let's get rid of this browser and
now this doesn't auto-refresh so you
need to click on choose a folder and
most people you might be saving two
libraries pictures so select that if
that's your case if not go to custom
desktop like I did and just click on
that folder where you saved it it will
refresh just like that and now you can
see really simply just click on it and
it'll swivel to change just like that
and we have starcraft 2 here as well but
here is the Skyrim one that is nice
looking and guys this will be in our
upcoming Skyrim desktop so you see my
theme is all blue and starcraft right
now i am planning to create one that
reflects Skyrim hopefully I can get it
out before the games out so keep an eye
out for that this will probably be the
theme i use for the logon screen once
you have this ready click on settings
for extra options now i know this is
hard to read on my screen I'm apologize
for that that's partially the program
issues but basically you can go here to
the shadow section no shadow light
shadow shadow or dark shadow which I
currently have and that shadow is just
going to be the text how will the text
is if you have a really bright
background like just all white then you
probably want to shadow that way you can
read it close that hit apply and just
let it do its then the orange bar is
going once it's done you just there goes
it's done now so if I hit ctrl delete
just like that the screen will pop up
and that's my control delete screen with
the new background pretty sweet and
pretty easy you can also do this with
your windows 7 logon screen when you
reboot the computer and log in I'm not
going to do that right now because my
recording will end so you guys can check
all that stuff out pretty nice super
easy let us know if you have any
problems in the comments below
we are glad to help out any time and

more videos to make sure you have the
coolest gaming related everything

and updates we put them out as much as
