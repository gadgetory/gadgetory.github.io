the market with their own two old fan
cooler an axial cooler at that EVGA is
out here showing that they know what to
do
so EVGA has three cars they're showing
today I'm gonna go through the names
first before I forget them there's the
FTW three ultra which is a big one over
here there's an XC ultra so that is a
it's using a reference PCB it's the
first to fan 2.75 slot cooler $1,250 for
that one and then there's an XC just
this one right here so this is a two
slot card before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the view 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 so now that we've gotten
the names out of the way the FTW three
will have a counterpart a hybrid version
so there will be an FTW three hybrid
later we'll talk about all the specs the
cooler BRM in a moment for what we know
anyway there will be a kingpin card I
know that some of you were asking
whether there would be one while there's
going to be and it will have a custom
PCB also this time a bit interestingly
the kingpin card will supposedly be a
hybrid so that's a bit different as well
for those cards so there will be a
hybrid FTW three hybrid kingpin which
just if you don't know it just means
it'll have a closed-loop liquid cooler
attached to it and then the other cards
are dual fan dual axial coolers that one
of them has ice TX on it so interesting
thing here with IC X 2 IC X 2 has a
hardware monitor for power so it can
produce a wattage read out through
precision x1 which is a new version of
precision actually pretty interesting
we'll be talking about that momentarily
so onboard hardware monitoring for power
a bit new and different will test how
accurate it is all that stuff later in
terms of thermals cooling and and noise
acoustics should be significantly
quieter in theory for the temperature
than the reference cards that Nvidia
showed off the other day and
from what we understand the reference
cards have a vapor chamber that fully
occludes the PCB so any air that doesn't
get down that well no air will get down
there any non contacted area of the PCB
won't be cooled and that's where EVGA
and the board partners still have a
chance to shine plus these companies
have been making fans for a long time or
at least designing them so they've got a
pretty good idea of how to do that
whereas Nvidia's just getting into it so
that's the basics so four parts on the
FTW three card there is a vrm contact
plate that we should have a shot of I
think but it's got a thermal pad between
it and the vrm so there's a base plate
and then on top of that there's a
contact plate which is contacting the
actual massive heat sink for the 2.75
slot card so thorough pads connecting
those I believe it the transfer medium
is going directly into the plate but I'm
not sure we might have a separate video
of taking it apart and if we do then
obviously check that out and see what it
looks like
so FTW three overall biggest card most
expensive will put the prices up on
screen if we haven't gone through them
already so that covers that one this one
pretty straightforward dual fan dual
slot card it's the smallest that EVGA
has got should still outperform the new
reference model I know that's a big
concern from everyone right now and then
this thing right here is just a plate so
they're still figuring out the price I
guess the question for you all is what
would you pay for this it's an aluminum
shroud it goes on top of the FTW three
and it's about that or maybe one
millimeter thick aluminum or something
like that maybe I so many close to that
anyway so what would you pay for that if
anything and then also ebj is looking at
doing more customizable color for their
cooler shrouds as well so you can have
black white red available in sets of two
I think they're looking at 20 bucks for
those we might have some footage of them
and then the other card we've got
footage of as well it's the X t2 ultra
so I see x2 on that one it's a bit wider
at 2.75 slots and a bit more expensive I
think that gets to all of it so yeah
some cards that we know of that aren't
here today but the three big ones are
here
check back subscribe for the hopefully
teardown of the FTW 3 we'll see
and as always going to store it on
cameras X's on that to help us out
directly patreon.com slash gamers
there as well I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
