sweet my name is Tony I'm the marketing
manager for source and technology today
we're looking here at new case that's
coming version a couple of months it's
called The Raven arvizu for you can see
from the side it has an upside down
loadable orientation they'll fit up to
extended ATX motherboard and anything
smaller than that it also fits seven
hard drives so here you have a removable
hard drive rack that fits five hard
drives in addition to to hotswap capable
drive cages and beneath the drive cages
you can actually melt additional for
ssds on the following the case and you
can also see here right up one of the
drive cages there's a cpu support mount
so that'll hold up I any really heavy
CPU coolers that you may have in
addition we also included a bracket here
that will allow you to also hold on your
heavy graphics card okay and if you can
see the case the entire case is designed
for maximum airflow so things like the
drive cage and also this plastic mount
here for the extended graphical
supporters are all act acting as part of
the I guess an air duct to help direct
airflow to where they need it so another
improvements that we made compared to
some of our older cases in getting as
few I guess a restriction as possible
through the fem filters and also
front of the case so things like the
vent filter here are designed to let air
flow through much higher than before
whereas before their air flow rates
about sixty percent these are about
ninety percent okay second thing that we
did differently compared to us all to
all the cases that we have is that there
are no metal grilles on the front panel
so the fans operating in the most
efficient with the least amount of air
turbulence so that there's two things
not only increasing airflow but also
reducing air turbulence and one upgrade
are we made to the older fan it's also
value the case will come speed switches
that allow you to select three different
speed as opposed to two before so for
those who viewed are looking for the
fortress version of this new case layout
and we have the fortress at t 0 for
that's finished it's very beautiful
aluminum outer panel so the top is Ellen
moon and front door is bended you a
shade extruded element very beautiful
and very solid on inside there are few
things different from the RV 04 and
that's the sound dampening material
behind the front door and also on a
bottom top panel and also two side
panels at TF also receive upgraded AP
182 fan standard so that means instead
of speech switches they are now speak
knobs house
that allow you to adjust the fan speed
down from down to 500 rpm and up to
2,000 feet and you can see the really
interesting slanted vent here on the
sides the angle backwards so that
designed to direct noise away from the
user and tore the back of the case so
there's a third case based on the exact
same internal design we know our
engineers thought that with all the
extra cooling power that we designed
with Dario for and FTO for that there's
another way to utilize all this
performance and that is to create a case
with on scene I guess dustproof ability
on find any computer cases before so on
the front we have a 3 ms a filter okay
this is very strict if they do they're
great for air purifiers and air
conditioners but not so for computers
usually because usually computer fans
aren't powerful enough to overcome the
resist resist inspired by these set of
filters so with a better airflow ability
that RV or for an FTO for design that
gives you decide that maybe this is
worth a try and it turned out for a long
testing that is actually this case is
actually capable of overcoming this
filter here and to cool a mid-range to
high-end system so I think this will be
really good for people that may be
living in very dusty or working in very
testing environment to have a case that
can truly be dust proof and there are
other design elements that we
implemented like the slanted bends on
the front and the back so he can see
even the cabling on the back are covered
so that means the case is also somewhat
spill-proof so you could have
and accidental water spilled on top of
this and your system should be fun and
something so we gave the name of this
case on eventually settle on the named
minute okay because the mammoths
survived in very harsh conditions in
during the Ice Ages so we think this
name also fit this case really well
because we'll be you know capable of
surviving in very harsh computing
environment so those are the three new
tower cases here we have a 2013 this one
is still just a prototype that these two
are coming with in this quarter with
retail price ranging around one hundred
fifty dollars for the Raven over two
hundred dollar for the fortress and for
this is still unknown so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
