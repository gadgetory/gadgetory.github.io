sweet my name is Tony I'm the marketing
manager for sourcing technology today
we're looking here at a new case that's
coming very soon in a couple of months
it's called the Raven our visa for me
and can see from the side it has an
upside down loadable orientation and
it'll fit up to an extended ATX
motherboard and anything smaller than
that it also fits seven hard drives here
you have a removable hard drive rack
that fits five hard drives in addition
to two hot-swap capable drive cages and
beneath the drive cages you can actually
mount them additional four SSDs on the
filing of the case and you can also see
here right up one of the drive cages
there's a CPU support mount so that I'll
hold up any really heavy CPU coolers
that you may have in addition we also
included a bracket here that will allow
you to also hold on your heavy graphics
card and if you can see the case the
entire case is designed for maximum
airflow so things like the drive cage
and also this plastic mount here for the
extended graphic has supporters all Act
acting as part of the I guess an air
duct to help direct air flow to where
they need it so another improvements
that we made compared to some of our
older cases in getting as few I guess
restriction as possible through the FEM
filters
front of the case so things like the FEM
filter here are designed to let air flow
through much higher than before whereas
before the air air flow rates about 60%
these are about 90% okay second thing
that we did differently compared to us
onto all the cases that we have is that
there are no metal grills on the front
panel so the fans operating in the most
efficient with the least amount of air
turbulence so that there's two things
not only increasing air flow but also
reducing air turbulence and one upgrade
that we made to the older fan it's also
that in the case were coming with speed
switches that allow you to select three
different speed as opposed to two so for
those of you are looking for the
fortress version of this new case layout
then we have the fortress at T zero four
that's finished this very beautiful
and front door has been to use a shape
extruder element very beautiful very
solid inside there are a few things
different from the RV o4 and that's the
sound dampening material behind the
front door and also on a bottom top
panel and also two side panels at the
off also receive upgraded ap 182 fan
standard so that means instead of speech
switches they are now speak knobs house
they'll allow you to adjust the fan
speed down down to 500 p.m. and up to
$2,000 you and you can see the really
interesting slanted vent here on the
sides they're angled backwards so that
designed to direct noise away from the
user and tour the back of the case so
here's the third case based on the exact
same internal design we you know our
engineers thought that with all the
extra cooling power that we designed
with our vo for and at to4 but there's
another way to utilize all this
performance and that is to create a case
with on seeing I guess the spoof ability
on for any computer cases before so on
the front we have a 3-ethyl filter okay
this is a very restrictive they do
they're great for air purifiers and air
conditioners but not so for computers
usually because usually computer fans
aren't powerful enough to overcome the
with this resistance provided by these
set of filters so with the better
airflow ability that RV or for an FTO
for design gifts you decided that maybe
this is worth a try and it turned out
for a long testing that is actually this
case is actually capable of overcoming
this filter here and to cool a mid-range
to high-end system so I think this will
be really good for people that may be
living in very dusty working in very
testing environment to have a case that
can truly be dust preserved and there
are other design elements that we have
invented like the slanted bends on the
front in the back so he can see even the
cabling on the back are covered so that
means the case is also somewhat spill
proof so you could have
and I'll accept them the water spilled
on top of this and your system should be
fun I'm sorry so we give the name of
this case I'll eventually set it on the
named minute okay because the mammoth
survived in very harsh conditions in
during the Ice Ages so we think this
name also fail this case was really well
because we'll be you know capable of
surviving in very harsh computing
environment those are the three new
tower cases with here we have a 2013
this one it's still just a prototype but
these two are coming within this quarter
with retail price ranging around $150
for the Raven over $200 for the fortress
and for this is still unknown so stay
tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
