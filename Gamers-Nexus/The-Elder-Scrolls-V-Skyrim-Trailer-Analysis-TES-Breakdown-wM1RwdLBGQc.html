and we are going to be analyzing the
elderscrolls v Skyrim in game trailer so
let's skip ahead to where we start
seeing new elements that are not
cinematic the first stuff we really
start seeing is this falling snow right
here the snow is dynamic it does not
dynamically accumulate but it there are
weather patterns that are dynamic as
it's been stated by Todd Howard so
that's pretty cool that makes the game
feel a lot more realistic a lot more
open and it's gonna it probably will
limit visibility which is also pretty
cool strategic elements I wonder that
might affect sneak which which would be
pretty nice if weather actually has a
gameplay mechanic effect let's continue
here our hero is it's gonna be fighting
this dragon we're going to talk about
this more in a little bit but the dragon
fight nothing new here he's dual
wielding weapons we've already heard the
mechanics will include dual wielding
specifically meaning that you cannot
cast spells if you have a shield and a
sword in your hands you probably and I
think that's what we see here you
probably can do dragon shouts because
this guy and the trailer clearly is
doing some kind of a magical effect or
shout while wielding two weapons which
means that he wouldn't be able to have a
spell in one so we're gonna assume
that's a dragon chat okay after the
shout is yelled we see the first glimpse
of towns which is really really nice we
see a big tower here with a waterfall in
the background and it's it's a Stoney
the villa in the mountains somewhere
nothing too special about that next we
see animals that are walking around in
the forest which it might sound stupid
but is actually kind of significant
because that means that you won't only
be seeing monsters in the forest there
will actually be small animals to make
it feel more realistic and again more
dynamic in the background if you look
really closely at 1 minute and 15
seconds you can see what looks like a
ruined statue with just a giant head so
that that kind of adds to the elements
we will be exploring and it'll just make
it feel a lot more alive here we are
seeing another town
if the bloom on the background is
beautiful
there are bloom effects crisp graphics
fantastic shadows and what looks like
this I'm going to say
I'm putting money on this I'm saying
this is a smithy five bucks however it
might just be a torch
either way you see the smoke
environmental effects and some really
nice bloom at one minute and 21 seconds
we see the first working wood no we've
heard a lot about these lumber mills and
wood cutting and all these skills we've
actually I think we've only heard five
skills listed say in the comments below
if you know more but the lumber mill is
actually pretty nice it has a guy
working the mill inside or outside of it
right next to it and it looks like two
guys mining or cutting wood over to the
right the point is whatever they're
doing they are doing something they're
not just walking around waiting for you
the hero to talk to them their life no
longer revolves around yours they're the
Bethesda has made the NPC's appear to
actually have lives of their own and the
economy of towns will be based on these
skills that they're operating out of so
the lumber mill if it is destroyed
because you fail a quest or destroyed by
you this will affect the town's economy
they will now have to import lumber from
other towns which might increase the
cost of lumber based items not that you
would be using a wooden shield against a
fire-breathing dragon but you got the
point
continuing on one second at one minute
and twenty two mainly you see the
reflection on the water of the
background sky bridge kind of thing so
that that just shows the waters really
improved a lot and this is some kind of
real and really nice waterfall this is
cool the giant is awesome the game has
returned to a fantasy base setting yes
oblivion was technically fantasy but it
was more than toured medieval than
fantasy and that's because they took out
a lot of the really unique stuff that we
saw in morrowind so the more when fans
will probably be really happy to see
things like Giants return and giant
spiders and drag this giant particular
massive Club you probably don't to get
hit with I'm guessing that'll be pretty
cool in combat the graphics are
beautiful he has large hands to show off
his stature the leather is really well
done the skulls look great
it just it fits it fits the setting
perfectly and I think it's a restore to
fantasy that we have been waiting for
it's been 10 years almost since Moreland
and it's really remarkable that they're
finally going back to it the town is
pretty cool too on the left side we see
the water mill which is again similar to
the lumber mill it shows that a working
economy is in place and that there is a
different selection of buildings
compared to oblivion it's not just
houses and stores it now actually has
industry and economy the guy in front of
us they're just showing how the NPC's
walk around with a smarter AI which
implies that they will not be standing
around waiting for you to talk to them
they have set paths that they follow at
day and at night and that will really
improve the dynamics of the town
sneaking fighting the dragon this I
think tell me below what you think I
think at 1 minute and 31 seconds it
looks like a werewolf let me know in the
comments thick dual wielding mechanic is
in use here he has fire in his left hand
which is a spell and the sword in the
right so that just shows how that works
murder in the tavern fighting the dragon
again blasting a spell with a wand this
is really cool
at one minute and 36 seconds we see some
spinning around which would indicate new
combat maneuvers or at least new combat
graphics similar to oblivion if you used
right-click and acrobatics then it would
do stuff so I'm going to skip these next
few seconds and watch that again we see
him fighting the guy again and doing a
finishing move right here at one minute
and 44 seconds he's getting stabbed
through the gut as a finishing move we
have heard that these are going to be in
the skill tree for each individual
weapon there are skill trees now you've
probably already heard some base sword
stuff like that
nurse Spears unfortunately and then he
kills the dragon and fights the giant
spider and nothing really that we don't
expect here other than he does absorb
the dragons power I don't know if that's
cinematic or if that is when he becomes
Dovahkiin or embraces the power
tell me what you think but I think I
think this is really the Elder Scrolls
game we've been waiting for for years
for a decade and we're really looking
forward to it follow us on gamers Nexus
dotnet or at gamers Nexus on Twitter if
you are looking for updates on the game
we will keep analyzing these as they
come out I will also keep posting news
and eventually the review so let me know
what you guys think if any of you are at
PAX East come say hi we'll be there
about six of us and we are going to talk
to Beth Asda so stay tuned
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
