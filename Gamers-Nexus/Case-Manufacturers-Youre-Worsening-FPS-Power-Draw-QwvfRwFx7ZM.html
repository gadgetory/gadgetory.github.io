case well we're working with bit wit
technologies group we've now made our
own tempered glass and RGB case the case
even comes with a front panel that opens
so it is a hinged front panel and
there's a there's well it's a prototype
there's a fan on it and so the fan is
actually mounted to the front of the
glass we thought this was a rather
innovative approach to case design
because most of them if you look at the
cases now normally the fans are behind
the glass but then you can't really see
the fan very well so we're hoping to
work with Noctua to get one of these
license for the case and we're gonna
mount it to the outside you can actually
feel the cool air coming off of it which
is really nice when you're gaming when
the system is just getting really hot
and you can feel the cool air hitting
you it's a prototype just work with me
here before getting to that this video
is brought to you by synergy the
software that lets you share a keyboard
and mouse between multiple systems if
you have limited desk space and multiple
computers to command synergy removes the
need for separate peripherals or a KVM
and works as over the network software
use our link below to get 50% off the
home or provision with ssl so this is
our case it's got tempered glass on the
on the side at the top and we've got RGB
elements so this is our version of the
modern case industry so here's where we
get real this is an address to the case
manufacturers the case PM's the
marketing folks who have some hand on
how much cases can cost and what they're
sold for this is addressing all of you
and there are a lot of good trends in
the case industry that have come up over
the last few years I remember not long
ago when a case review would praise a
case for having thumb screws that was
the thing and if a thumb screw couldn't
be unscrewed by your fingers then well
that was just bad marketing it was false
it was not actually a thumb screw it
wasn't a tool that's design but the
point is that was what we would talk
about in case reviews it was a function
feature of the case function focused and
not long after that you start getting
cable management as
big point of praise where traditionally
you'd have like the Antec 900 was a
hugely popular case but men it had awful
cable management if you go back and look
at it now but it wasn't really a thing
then and now it is manufacturers have
improved in that department they've
improved and a lot of things really and
one of them is just stepping away from
all of the unnecessary extras like those
included for example the hue that used
to be included in the 820 that was
eventually removed and turned into a
separate unit because really a case
doesn't have that many jobs and once you
start complicating it it gets worse it
costs more but now the thing is as we
all know tempered glass and RGB LEDs and
that's fine too
there's absolutely a place for both of
those things unfortunately what's
happening is these manufacturers are
getting so crazed / checking the
tempered glass box and checking the RGB
box that we're forgetting basic things
like a computer needs to be able to
breathe and you know this is our mesh
model age 500p this is not an attack on
the H 500 P there are plenty of other
cases that have these problems
lots of them the BitFenix and so that we
saw at Computex
and put in our needs work category that
was one of them the Antec p8 that's
another one whatever the new and tech
one is called that was announced like
three days ago that's another one so you
know not every case needs to have a mesh
front panel that's not what we're asking
for
but there are some design elements that
you can use to keep the function of some
breathability enough to keep your clocks
up on a GPU without turning it into a
full mesh panel and we actually have
numbers and data on all this so I
thought I would kind of compile it into
one video to share with the
manufacturers so that they can use this
as some research or some ammunition
internally to make changes so we've got
information on the balance for example
between mash and glass and how wide the
side skirts of a front panel should be
we have that information we also have
information on for example the threshold
the tipping point for when as you are
trying to suppress the noise of a case
and clamped on how much noise comes out
of it you also have to kind of up the
RPM on the fans and get louder fans in
there potentially to to counteract and
counterbalance the noise suppression or
the noise damping element so there's a
trade-off there and at some point you
pass the threshold we're sealing it off
isn't going to be better when you have
louder fans in there also there are
instances that I think in the thermal
world that manufactures these days being
that they are in the case industry and
not in GPUs and CBO benchmarking may not
even realize that by putting panels on
cases like these and like what we've
done here by doing that you actually can
worsen the FPS of people playing games
think about that it's not so this this
thermal thing when I talk about thermal
is in all these case reviews it's not
just because we're trying to find a
point of data to nitpick a case about
it's because there are actual
differences to your experience as a user
when the temperature is higher of the
components in the case a lot of them one
of them is noise noise goes up because
you're trying harder to cool everything
GPU fan spin up case fan spin up another
one is just simply the power consumption
as heat goes up you have more power
leakage another framerate and clocks so
let's talk about that one I'd like to
present this idea to the case
manufacturers so that everyone is on the
same page for what happens when you
suffocate a case with a panel that might
look good but could have just added
another quarter inch to the front side
skirt so that it could breathe better
that's really all you need in a lot of
cases but looking at the numbers you
know we have older data from the Titan
XP when we overclocked it by about 120
megahertz and just for example in Ghost
Recon at 4k way back when we ran these
tests originally the difference was
about 8% in frame rate going from 60 to
65 FPS average and when we went to 1440p
the difference was about 9.5 percent and
that's from a non overclocked to a 100
to 120 megahertz overclocked on the GPU
so that particular 1440p and since was
95
- 104 that's about a 9 to 10 percent
gain but why mention 100 megahertz where
does that number come from why this
magical number well if we look at some
of our frequency over time plots where
it's like I said as a prototype the
frequency over time plots where we have
temperature and frequency plotted for
the entirety of a KS test what you'll
see is that the GPU frequency actually
Falls so this is very true for Pascal
where it's ultra sensitive to
temperatures every 5 degrees Celsius can
get you something extra Vega is going
the same direction and E is starting to
do similar stuff with their version of
boost
so both GPU manufacturers are on board
with this idea of effectively pre
overclocking GPUs as high as they can be
based on parameters such as temperature
and voltage and power so on the vote on
the temperature front you have for
example hitting close to the throttle
values on open phase cards that are dual
axial fans like the gaming acts that we
test cases with perfectly normal fans
use for a GPU and when it starts
throttling at around 82 to 84 degrees
Celsius what happens is the clock will
drop and you can plot it and see about a
100 megahertz decline in for example the
Antec p8 versus for example the H 500 P
with no front panel at all so I'm
picking those two because the anti p8
was a case that throttled quite a bit
and the Coolermaster won the H 500 P
when we took this panel off obviously
it's going to have the best airflow it
can case is inherently worse in your
performance from open air that's just
how it works but you can do things like
directional air stuff like that all that
notwithstanding they generally will
worsen your performance so removing the
panel and having the best GPU
performance we can for that case we were
keeping about 100 megahertz higher
clocks than the anti p8 stock and so the
point of pointing that out is that the
difference in buying a case that has a
front like let's say that silverstone PM
a one case difference between buying a
case like this that breathes and buying
a case that's closed off in the front
like the antec p8 or the age 500 P or
the Enzo or any number of other cases
the fantex ones some of the NZXT cases
everyone's pretty much guilty of this
with some cases but the difference is
buying a better case can get you a
couple percentage extra performance in
terms of frame rate like between six and
ten percent depending on what kind of
GPU you're using how much you're
dropping clocks what kind of
temperatures you're running things like
that and yes you can absolutely counter
that you could increase your GPU fan
profile to go at it more aggressive
curve go up to 70 percent sure that
fixes the problem insofar as working
around it but it makes everything louder
- and the real fix would be a case that
doesn't suck so that's what we're trying
to get here and to think that your case
purchase can impact your frame rate just
like it's it's not something that you
necessarily think about until I saw the
data a couple years ago I didn't think
about it either and I don't know that
the case manufacturers necessarily think
about that so here's the thing let me
give a couple pointers here now that
we've gotten some of the hard data out
of the way
let's talk about power leakage so power
leakage we've gotten the clocks out of
the way that impacts frame rate on the
power front for every 10 ish degrees
Celsius you drop in CPU temperature you
also reduce power consumption by about
4% this is a somewhat goes to power
leakage and power efficiency of the CPU
we found this when testing deleted CPUs
we've consulted with others in the
industry this seems to be a general good
rule of thumb so by running a case
actually we can show data for this -
let's take our recent Nhu 14s air cooler
knock - air cooler for thread Ripper
it's a pretty good one let's take that
and put it against the NR max 240 lick
tag liquid cooler and in that chart you
can see a difference of about 9 degrees
Celsius so that 9 degrees Celsius if we
plot it in terms of the power
consumption for each test with a known
workload and a known power requirement
to complete that workload we see a
difference of about 11 watts so the
enter
a cooler with the threader for 1950 X at
4 gigahertz 1.3 5 volts consumes about
320 watts CPU load during its average
peak for that test whereas the Naga Wan
it's not much lower but it's 310 312
somewhere in there and some of that
comes down to efficiency how the CPU is
or how the cooler is dealing with the
heat and how efficiently it's getting
the heat away from the CPU so that I can
continue operating without the
additional heat load and the power
leakage and things like that so this is
all to say that a 10 degree difference
in a case although it may be a
difference between let's say 80 and 90
degrees so a case manufacturer might say
well who cares it's outside of throttle
territory anyway
just remember that can impact a lot of
things on a GPU 80 to 90 degrees even
even 70 to 80 degrees on Pascal will
show a difference because it's so
sensitive to temperatures and Vega is
kind of go in the same way and then the
power difference is just extra on top of
all of that noise of course is a concern
to you increase the fan RPMs we actually
we've got data for this one as well
uh-huh so there's I think four back when
we did a bunch of Vega testing we had
some PWM versus rpm and noise response
charts and one of them shows the the
noise level per 10 percent increase in
fan PWM so you go from twenty to a
hundred percent what's the noise
increase we can show that data and it's
really it's not an insignificant jump in
noise levels to go from something like
forty percent fan speeds to something
like sixty you start getting a lot
louder when you do that and that's what
case manufacturers are asking you to do
or if I'm addressing the case
manufacturers that's what you are asking
us to do is either through automated
curves in the GPU v bios or through
manual efforts increasing the fan speeds
thereby increasing the noise levels
thereby making your case like a whole
hell of a lot worse once it's in an
actual real use case so that's what
we're
talking out on the thermal noise and
power side willingly nuking performance
by upwards of 10% with the worst case
cases is insane and it's clearly not
intentional it's just not well
researched and it's a byproduct of an
industry that's trying more to keep up
with trends than they are to keep up
with things that should be standard
which is a computer that is used for
gaming and I mentioned that because
everyone just so crazily brandishes all
of their cases with the word gaming a
computer used for gaming if you actually
know the audience you know the people
you're trying to sell to it's gonna
generate heat and when you generate heat
you really need something to work with
it so let's talk about some of the
solutions here obviously this case we
made is patented so don't copy it but
other than that you can try things like
for an example most of these panels
really just spacing them in our testing
and again in consultation with some of
the thermal engineers I actually trust
in the industry to design a good product
generally speaking in our tests and we
find that about a 1 inch gap on the side
is enough to compensate for a flat
non-ventilated front so let's take
something like the H 440 that case came
out with a version 2 H 440 steel as new
I'd calls it orjust
h 440 version 2 the reason that came out
with a version 2 other than a couple of
small changes internally is to increase
the breathability in the mesh on I
believe the top and the front and that's
because they increase the distance a
little bit between the chassis and the
front or the back rather of the front
panel so if you have a panel like this
let's just pretend that the front is
closed off so we're just gonna say maybe
they've done something like that and you
have a closed-off front panel a good
solution as we've found is to take the
side like this one this is a pretty
thick side so we can take this and cut
about a one inch hole all the way down
you can add some filtration if you want
you know
our master for as much as they screwed
up on the age 500p this is a good
direction to go it's just not enough for
a whole lot of other reasons that we
discussed elsewhere but you do something
like that on the side that basically
solves for any severe throttling issues
and of course you have to have
intelligent fan placement and make sure
that makes sense too especially if
you're dealing with all like static
pressure variables or negative versus
positive airflow what you want in the
case things like that but generally
speaking that will help a lot so an
example of a case that's done that well
would be the coarser of 600 C it was one
of the best thermal performance with our
old case bench and that had a lot of
ventilation space on the sides of the
front panel but the front was still a
solid piece of plastic so you've
achieved both the the sleek look that
everyone wants now and also still having
a breathable case that actually performs
really damn well and that's because of
their fan placement because they're fans
and it's because of that huge ventilated
side of the front panel and the other
panels on the case another point of
consideration is power supply shroud so
PSU shrouds look good I mean they hide
all of that cable clutter everyone wants
that and there's a reason everyone
started doing it after NZXT did the I
think the aged 440 was one of the first
with it and later that's 240 and of
course they've got competition now from
fan tax Corsair BitFenix silverstone
coolermaster antec everyone else also so
it's obviously an idea that everyone
likes and consumers as well but keep in
mind that any time you add a power spy
shroud to a case when the video card is
within a couple inches of that shroud
the open face cards particularly they
start to increase in their temperatures
so we can show this in some of our
reviews for cases where you see a CPU
temperatures might actually be great
they could be super competitive but when
you've got a shroud in there the GPU
temperatures climb a little bit it's not
always bad because the ventilation can
help a lot the front intakes obviously
can be aligned with the fan to help with
those problems but something you can do
to help get rid of the heat is when
positioning the fan
make sure the dead zone of the fan isn't
sort of directly in line with it where
the fans intake on a GPU assuming the
top PCIe slot mount and - I get a fan
down there to begin with so you got a
fan kind of lower down maybe between the
prototype GPU and the CPU or just
straight across on the GPU but the hot
air needs somewhere to go and those open
face cards obviously just kind of blow
it everywhere in the case so radiative
heat off the back of the backplate
should more or less be dealt with by any
fans cooling the CPU so we can kind of
ignore that and there's often a rear
exhaust that just gets rid of it anyway
so you can cut some mesh holes in the
back or use the PCIe slot covers that
are ventilated they have all the holes
punched in them that helps with getting
the heat out and away from the video
card when it's done cooling itself
another point to consider the video card
vertical mounts are popular now for good
reason they look good but the problem
with these also is that video card
temperatures go up quite a bit when
they're not positioned correctly two
good examples recently would be the
thermal take view 71 which we found
first was the the first problem with
this that we saw and the other I think
was either the C 700 P or actually they
think it was the aged 500 P as well and
the problem with both of these cases is
that the distance between a dual axial
faceplate of a card and the glass is
often like an inch or less and with a
blower fan it probably works a bit
better those slots work really well for
open loops obviously that's better what
they're better designed for because
you're not dealing with air problem
solved
but if it's actually an air cooler which
is what most people use especially in
the cheaper cases that have vertical GPM
outs
keep in mind that spacing further from
the glass panel is going to help a hell
of a lot because otherwise all that heat
kind of turns comes off the fans hit the
glass and just gets trapped in there so
that's another point of consideration
that we've noticed recently is a
potential cause for concern where the
GPU can start heating up to a point of
increasing fan RPMs to compensate for
throttling if you've said it more clamps
down fans being curved so just to
reiterate here a few things one you
don't need a mesh front to be a good
case in our eyes you don't have to do
something like this although this is one
of the better cases you don't have to do
that to be good and we've demonstrated
with other cases in the past we've
demonstrated in the past that with cases
like fractal for instance fractal gets a
bit warm with the defined C but fractal
to their credit does a pretty good job
at balancing between making a case
that's fairly closed off and does do
that discrete sleek look that is so
popular while also maintaining some
level of breathability that is
acceptable and within what you would
expect to see in a hundred dollar case
so there are ways to do this sleek look
or clothes off glass look without
killing the performance and the define
see we liked a lot there are plenty of
other cases similar to it that we've
liked a lot the s340
is one of the cases that needs a rework
at some point looks like the h7 100 I
and 400 I 200 I will do that but that
was one where man it was a great case
but it doesn't have some thermal
concerns we complained a lot about the
s3 40 elite and its potential thermal
issues but it's all stuff you can work
around as a user because they've at
least designed the case in a way that
it's got the ventilation there they're
just leaving it up to you to add some
fans and fix it and that's not the best
solution but it's better than not having
the ventilation there at all and having
no good way to fix it without just raw
brute force and high noise so hopefully
some of that data helps the case
manufacturers I bring it up because I
know what it's like to have a job that
is hyper focused on something like
designing cases in that instance I know
that when you have a job like that you
lose sight of what's around you in terms
of the rest of the industry in the
ecosystem and losing sight of the rest
of the ecosystem means that you may not
realize that the clocks on a GPU are so
sensitive now that the extra couple
degrees
can cause a drop that impacts your
framerate so hopefully that kind of puts
that data out there and a more
digestible or a consumable way for the
manufacturers and the marketing people
but uh yeah I guess that's really all
I've got to say so hopefully there's
some improvement in the case industry in
terms of thermals you know we've gotten
the looks thing down pretty well this
year the last year has been all looks
all the time that's made some progress
in a lot of instances it's time to do a
little bit of a pendulum swing back the
other direction and find a balance point
in the middle and try and do the
function aspect of cases improve the
thermals even with fan placements or
with just better panel design and again
this is patent pending so hands off
