bucks makes in a video card with an
video somewhat forceful encouragement
for manufacturers to hit the $500 price
target on the r-tx 2070 which is really
difficult for them to do because profit
margins are really low if you wonder the
difference between a $500 r-tx 2070 and
a $550 r-tx 2070 this pretty much sums
it up
this is only the cooler from the 27th
exc ultra which is 50 to 70 dollars more
depending on where you look let's call
it 70 and this is the entire r-tx 2070
Black Edition and this card fits within
the space of the cooler alone for the XE
Ultra 2070 and this is an important
thing to look at it's it's important to
look at what does this 2070 really
clearly forced price that manufacturers
are mostly hitting at 500 bucks what do
you get for that 2070 versus what
happens if you spend a little bit of
extra money is it worth it because it's
it's a really weird market right now
with the way the r-tx launch went over
and some of the cards were just they're
not delivering the way we would like
them to and it's not really good for
anybody so we're going to look today at
the higher-end XE ultra 2070 versus the
bare bones basic 2070 black edition at
$500 before that this video is brought
to you by us and the limited edition
foil graph logo shirt this four color
foil shirt is the iconic GN graph logo
with average 1% and point one percent
bar colors it's printed on a soft
high-quality and custom made 100% cotton
shirt and is available on store
documents Nexis night until stock runs
out once it's gone we will not be making
more of these shirts we sold out within
two weeks of our previous limited
edition shirts so click on the link
below to preorder now to EVGA is credit
here they're 20 so d black is actually a
pretty damn good card for the $500 price
point and we're gonna call $500 cheap
because relative to other our tips cards
sadly it is but this one's pretty good
there are some really not good ones out
and we'll probably look at those at some
point this is one of the better ones so
we'll give them credit that means the
difference between this and the XE ultra
won't be quite as profound as perhaps
one of the low-end gigabyte models and
one of the higher-end models either way
though we're going to be just focusing
on the 20 70s today so the charts will
have everything in them they're only
really gonna be talking about the 27 TS
that were testing and if you want the
comparison who have the 27 t compares to
like Vega or GTX 10 series check our
previous content including the review or
the follow-up Vega 56 over power mod
where we blasted it with wattage and
current and everything blast it with a
lot of current basically we increase the
power target by 242 percent from
baseline and drove 500 watts into the
card do you want to see that content
check the other video because we'll
compare the cards there but this one's
just 20 70s so the real discussion here
is going to be overclocking thermals and
noise primarily on the overclocking side
and one of the reasons that is the
primary focus is because of the new
identifier on NVIDIA GPUs the terrine
GPUs have an a signifier at the end of
the middle digit so this is a tu 106 -
400 a - a 1 and a 1 is the revision
ignore that it's the 400 blank that
matters is it 400 or is it 400 a 400 a
is going to be a bit of a higher-end GPU
that NVIDIA has pre sorted for the Adhan
board partner and that will impact the
out-of-the-box frequencies and therefore
thermals to some extent so we'll be
talking about that today let's start
with overclock step and we'll get
through thermals games all that stuff
but it's really overclocking thermals
and noise that matter the most today
let's start with some overclock stepping
charts the 27th EXC ultra gets a 130
percent power target and has a PCB and
vrm that are basically from the 28 EF e
whereas the 27 t black uses a 27 TF e p
ZB v RM we have an analysis of both of
these already on the channel the XC
ultras higher power target helps in
overclocking with no offset at all our
stock performance on the XC ultra landed
us at nineteen fifty megahertz peak or
more realistically 19 10 megahertz
average once heated up the performance
cap was instantly power wear
remains capped until our next step in
the chart after increasing the power
target we sustained 1920 megahertz
average without any core offsets we
eventually ran up to a 125 megahertz
core offset still with zero megahertz
memory offset here and found stability
at about 20 40 megahertz when heated up
and left to Auto fan speeds of 15 80 rpm
the new limit was VL and power mixed
together and less so just strict power
this time memory overclocked very well
on this platform we found stability at
1080 megahertz offset for over 16
gigabits per second throughput the core
clock averaged 20 40 megahertz one left
to auto fan speeds or 2055 when allowed
below 60 degrees Celsius as a result of
the boosting algorithm let's bring the
20 70 black on screen now and put that
just below the FC ultra this chart shown
on the lower half of the screen shows
that our maximum overclock was 1950
megahertz average Winnett maximum fan
speeds or about 1935 megahertz
one left to auto fan speeds and 63
degrees the maximum memory overclock was
about 980 megahertz offset the core is
significantly faster on the XE ultra and
that's a result of the higher power
limit an extra 100 megahertz is
noticeable in gaming and thus produce a
frame rate difference note that there's
also a maximum fan speed difference of
3800 rpm on the 2070 black well it's
3000 on the XC ultra but the fatter
heatsink helps the XC ultra keep ahead
before getting into the thermal section
just some quick notes on methodology
it's been a while since we've updated
every one so for our testing we
previously validated our testing methods
for thermals for cases and GPUs and CPUs
in a thermal chamber so we have tests
and validation data from a thermal
chamber it all validated works well the
way we do it and we do a couple of
things here so one of them is a power
virus load on the GPU and that's a
hundred percent load it blasts the VRMs
another one of them is a 3dmark load
looping on the same rendering frame to
check for frequency over time and then
we also do a more gaming related test as
for thermals so we take the GPU
measurement of course through software
we use gpu-z for that and then
for the BRM and the memory you won't see
this many other places or any other
places we take thermocouple measurements
so rather than using a thermal imaging
device there MOG Rafi is really not a
good tool for this you can't see the vrm
or the memory when it's running because
there's a cooler there and you can't
just take a shot of the back of it or
the front of it and really tell much of
anything especially if there's a
reflective surface or an emissive
surface that'll throw off your
thermography so we use is we use
thermocouples that we attach to probe
individual components and for those
we're using thermocouples that use an
adhesive pad that's 1/100 of an inch
thick so it's literally laser thin it
does not interfere in any meaningful way
with thermal transfer the pad is a
combination of polyamide and poly methyl
phenyl siloxane and the thermocouple is
a K type hooked into our logging meters
the calibration offsets are applied as
necessary with the exact same
thermocouples used in the same spots for
each test and this is done as far as
calibration goes we you can use an ice
bucket bath and then hot bath or you can
use individual calibration devices to
calibrate the thermocouples and figure
out the variance variance T couple TT
couple is about 2.2 degrees Celsius for
K types and it's perfectly inaccurate so
if it's negative one it's always
negative one and then you just apply an
offset to your numbers you're good to go
so thermal testing the point is very
accurate when you come here for thermal
data you are getting some of the best in
the industry in terms of media coverage
for thermal so let's get into it
moving onto 3dmark frequency over time
charts here's a plot for fire strike
extreme and it's set rendering the same
frame on loop for about 30 minutes
the XC ultra average is about 1935
megahertz for the entirety of this test
whereas the 2070 black experiences clock
decay instantly from about 1815
megahertz down to 1780 1785 megahertz
the average frequency bounces between
1785 and 1800 on the 2070 black this is
a massive difference for the out of the
box frequencies and indicates that
performance advantage resultant of the
better bins GPUs is favoring the 2070 XE
ultra and Vidia cells these higher bin
farts to board partners for
Premium and it appears that the mixture
of the new silicon bidding procedure and
higher native power targets allow for a
large frequency advantage note that we
haven't done any overclocking here
either no power offs that's nothing like
that this is straight auto performance
and even with the better fan speeds on
the XE ultra the clock Delta is
primarily stem from Nvidia spinning of
those better great parts at the premium
paid regions of the a versus non AGP use
and you can see our teardown for more
information on that and then also of
course the boosted power target what we
really need to know is the noise
normalized thermal performance as
that'll equalize our primary variable
and allow us to see if the huge heatsink
actually matters so these are noise
normalized thermals at 40 DBA we take
these at a 20 inch measurement away from
the front of the shroud and this allows
us to see something very important which
is how does each card perform at a fixed
nose level so we are equalizing the
biggest variable and looking at GPU
performance which allows us to see how
good each individual cooler is now the
big difference here this time first of
all you can't really compare the twenty
eighty the ten eighty stuff like that
versus the twenty 70s you have to
compare intra card versions of twenty
seventy versus twenty seventy but even
that is difficult this time because the
twenty seventy is now sort of Bend
within itself it's got two different
versions of the twenty seventy and the
PCB quality of course is a big thing but
that is also why we do the noise
normalize thermals normally so anyway
regardless despite its higher frequency
the XC ultra manages to run lower 40 DB
a noise normalized thermals than the
twenty seventy black with a 33 degrees
Celsius over ambient GPU temperature
versus 37 on the twenty seventy black
this puts it as similar to some of the
1070 TI cards we test it again not
strictly comparable as they are
different architectures but it gives you
a good idea for where it lands on the
stack the MOSFET temperature is
significantly lower at 31 degrees over
ambient versus 43 degrees over ambience
on the lower end card ggd are six
temperature is warmer on the XC ultra
and this is primarily a result of the
proximity of the memory module to the
hotter components of the VR app we also
did one feature test without the back
plate just to see
actually does at 68% fan rpm controlled
and with an overclock and maximum power
offset so we've completely controlled
the environment here we did not see any
meaningful change with the presence of
the backplate for G GD r 6v RM or GPU
temperatures it certainly does something
though the backplate gets hot and that's
what you want in a backplate the fact
that it gets hot and is hot to the touch
means that it is conducting heat away
from something but we couldn't measure
the differences on the parts that we
probed so either we missed whatever it
is that it's pulling heat from or more
reasonably you might need some active
cooling over the plate to see more of a
difference or you might need to be in a
more thermally constrained environment
like a hot case either way although it
didn't impact our results positively or
negatively
it doesn't trap heat and make things
worse and that's good not all video
cards can say that so the backplate
isn't bad it doesn't do anything for the
things that we measured does something
but we just couldn't find the point of
measurement that would show that the
next test looks at acoustic performance
between the two for this we're measuring
noise levels at a 20 inch distance again
with a noise floor of about twenty six
point seven decibels the only active
component in the entire system is the
GPU strictly comparing the quote low-end
$500 20 70 and the $550 XC ultra model
the first reminder is that fan noise
caps at 3000 rpm on the XC ultra and
3800 for the Black Edition this is where
the larger cooler and better PCB on the
ultra allow it to spend slower the XC
ultra and 2070 black mostly increase in
staff with one another in terms of
acoustics and are within reasonable
variance for fan quality differences and
being completely different in general
the XC ultra typically spends at a lower
rpm one left to auto than the black that
is as both seem to stick around 63 to 64
degrees Celsius as their target
temperature in a bench that is not super
thermally constrained there isn't much
difference between these cards when
comparing them at a given rpm but the XC
ultra cools better at a given rpm than
the 20 70 black does as we saw in our
thermal and clock data from earlier
moving on to game benchmark
we are starting with far cry 5 here this
is on the dunya engine and as always we
do at least 4 test passes averaged over
each game for all three resolutions
which allows sufficient time for the
devices to heat up and get to their
average clock speeds as we showed in the
overclock stepping chart so this is
heavily controlled and is it's very
strict methodology to ensure that the
data remains accurate across all the
test passes on all the GPUs far cry 5 @
4k ranks the EVGA r-tx 2070 XE ultra
49.7 mph when fully stock indicating
that it is boosting higher than the
plain EVGA 2070 card and it's 46 fps
this is one part cooling and one part
power limitations as you saw in the
thermal and overclocking sections
overclocking the 2070 black with a + 200
+ 980 offset illustrates just how much
more the XE ultra is boosting out of the
box as it's offset maxed at plus 125 on
the core due to a higher stock clock
again roughly 1935 vs. 1800 megahertz
when both the EVGA are TX 20 70s our
overclocks putting us over 2000
megahertz for the 2070 XE ultra
especially we ended up at around 51 FPS
average on the 20 so d black + 54 FPS
average on the 27th EXC ultra they
mostly equalize in gaming at 1440p the
EVGA RT x 27 t black manages 84 FPS
average with the XE ultra at 90 FPS
average when stock the out-of-the-box
performance uplift is about 6.7 percent
on the XE ultra firstly 27 t black
overclocking both cards allows the XE
ultra to retain its lead as a result of
landing a higher on the volt frequency
curve from lower temperatures though the
gap closes to a difference of 3 fps and
that's between 97 fps and 93 fps maybe 4
then so they are basically
indistinguishable in frame rate when
overclocked noise and thermals are a
different aspect and we already
discussed those finally will flash 1080p
up for a moment the differences between
the stock 27 TS at 118 FPS average and
the XC ultras 126 FPS average is about
6% once again and overclocking gets the
to reasonably close together low frame
times are stronger on the XE ultra than
on the stock card I've seen in these 67
fps 0.1% low vs. 81 fps zero on for low
on the XE ultra this is due to boosting
behavior and clock stability let's move
Sniper Elite four positions the
twenty-seventh exe ultra 71 FPS average
with lows at 61 FPS and 59 FPS the r-tx
20 70 stock card runs at 64 FPS average
closer to the overpowered Vega 56 mod
that we have the difference between the
stock XC ultra and the 71 FPS average
that it performs and the basic 20 70
cards is about 11 percent favoring the
RDX 27 exe ultra frame times are
proportionately time overclocking allows
exe ultra to hold a significant lead
likely in part due to video memory load
balancing in this game we're looking at
77 FPS average which is 71 FPS average
for the overclocks
providing a reasonable advantage here
for the XC ultra weather that's worth
$50 is sort of debatable for f1 2018 at
4k we found the 2070 stock card to
perform at about 60 FPS average well
then I see ultra up to 66 FPS average
this is reasonable again for gains
although overclocking does push the
stock 2070 above the XE Ultra stock and
overclocking the XE ultra reestablishes
its lead once again over the 2070 Black
Edition at 1440p the XE ultra again is
about 10% higher frame rate at 1:12 he
has average versus 100 FPS average with
low-end performance about the same
between the two overclocked in both
cards gets them to 120 FPS average for
the XE ultra and 115 FPS average for the
2070 black again leading to the question
of when the extra $50 is worth it the
answer is primarily in thermals and
noise which are directly related and
we're already discussed not in raw
framerate 1080p produces similar
scallion with the XE ultra again ahead
reliably and with the overclocking
permitting the XE ultra to remain in the
lead again still it's not quite tie in
with the GTS 1080 TI for performance
here but it is approaching the sc2 is
166 FPS average one left stock shadow of
the Tomb Raider is next this one post
similar results at 4k with the 20 70
black OC time the 2070 XE ultra stock
again we're seeing largely single-digit
performance improvements in the
performance for the XE old Trevor's of
the stock or black edition model have
1440p the overclocked XE ultra is a few
points ahead of the overclocked 2070
once again with the same thing happening
with stock performance and no
overclocking finally for power
consumption we measured the following
plot and ashes of the singularity for K
crazy
once all benchmark rounds were aligned
and synchronized in data our data log
inputs
ts 4k benchmark at a total system power
draw of about 320 Watts peak for the
2070 black and 27 exc ultra stock cards
alike with occasional spikes to 357
watts missus total system power draw
just to just be really clear here it
would appear that both 27 TS draw about
the same power when stock
despite the XE ultra offering
meaningfully more performance and it's
testing these are both power constrained
by Nvidia when the 27 exc ultra is
overclocked though it peaks at 400 watts
total system draw and average is 357
watts to 380 watts again this is total
system power consumption but the
motherboard and platform voltages are
fully controlled to keep consistent
power needs for all non GPU components
so I real this difference we see here is
when we overclocked but XC ultra
otherwise they're all power constrained
so that's everything we have for you for
the most part we've got more game tests
but at some point you got to cut it off
because did actually just doesn't matter
anymore the difference there was a
pattern forming it's the same in all the
other games we did GTA did a couple
others we'll post those in the article
linked in the description below if you
really want the data but no point going
over it here because the story remains
the same so is it worth the extra money
an extra 50 bucks sure probably although
the debate of an RT X 2017 worth it at
all is separate so relatives strictly to
a $500 RT x 2070 a $550 XE ultra if you
can find one would be a decent deal the
problem is it's typically 565 75 80
somewhere in that range and this isn't
really the fault of the manufacturers
the price in there at today and Vidya is
taking record profits on their actual
GPU component sale and that's hurting
the margin for board makers unless they
can adapt obviously their pricing so the
550 would pay for it except there are
still 10 ATT eyes and they're not that
tested in price anymore so you're
probably better off buying a 1080i if
it's in budget if it's not you can look
at 10 ATS and those are pretty close to
the same price you might get a better
cooler
five hundred dollars for ten eighty
ninety I than you would for five hundred
dollars for this thing and this isn't
terrible but you can get a better ten
eighty cooler like an F TW or something
if we're equating EVGA to EVGA so it's
really a question of can you get the
performance you want from an in stock
Pascal card if you can find one you
probably still can and if you can still
find a Pascal card you get a 1080i for
within a hundred bucks of either of
these 2070 s just by that instead unless
RT X is really a thing that you want to
bet the future on perhaps better for
someone like a developer or someone who
does really any kind of work making
things that will use ray tracing or
whatever else you might be able to
leverage the tensor device Kent tensor
cores for so for just strict gaming
1080i at within a hundred bucks of one
of these is a good deal if you can
stretch the money if you can't a 1080 is
a good consideration if neither of those
options apply for various reasons then
the question between twenty seventy at
five hundred versus twenty seven eight
five fifty if you get something like
this for five fifty we'd say it's worth
the price jump five seventy s kind of
difficult to justify but prices are
fluid and they'll move around so anyway
that's what we got for you on this one
