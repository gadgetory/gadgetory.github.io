airflow on the market and we all know
what happened last time a case did that
the Corsair crystal 680 X is the new
larger sibling to the two ATX a micro
ATX case that we reviewed back in June
the similarity and appearance is pretty
obvious and coarser has done this multi
compartment design before but Corsair
has used the past year to make some
pretty significant changes the result is
something more than just a scaled up to
ATX and perhaps closer to a LAN leo 11
dynamic before that this video is
brought to you by be quiet and it's
straight power 11 series power supplies
the straight power 11 PSU is shipped
from 450 Watts up to a thousand Watts
accommodating most of the gaming PC
build requirements you'd encounter and
focuses on delivering a higher quality
power supply that doesn't sacrifice on
efficiency or stability noise is also a
heavy point for the straight power 11
using a 135 millimeters silent wayne's 3
fan that can spin as low as 200 rpm for
quieter low load operation learn more at
the link in the description below this
is the corsair 6 ATX it's actually a
pretty interesting case and we do like a
lot of things about it there are some
pretty pretty serious criticisms as well
as always but this case strikes a good
balance of things it does well and
things that it really didn't do well
just depending on what angle you're
looking at it from so the case itself
it's got the basics out of the way it's
$250 so it is a very expensive that's us
pricing very expensive case it has 4
fans with it we'll talk about all the
internals and stuff like that and
Patricks build notes momentarily and the
thermals but at $250 that's a pretty big
wall for a lot of people so instantly
narrows the market the case competes
them the most directly with something
like the cooler master H 500 M that
would be the high-end one with either
glass or mesh in the front the 200
millimeter a RGB fans we reviewed that
previously different models of the c7
hundred piastres from cooler master to
some extent the NZXT H 700 I ball though
the H 700 can be had for about 150 so
quite a bit different in price there and
also some of the high-end fan tax cases
like the evolve X without the dual
system kit that's about $200 so it's in
that range that market of cases and
the the 680 X here coarser has made some
pretty serious improvements over the 280
X now they're different markets ones
micro-atx one isn't
but the Ches body is pretty similar and
because of the history with the corsair
ii ATX the company has been able to pick
up and improve on something so it's
still a case that is fundamentally
limited by the style of the front panel
which is one of the major defining
features of both the 280 x and the 680 X
without any serious reworking of a case
there's not really a great way to get
air past that decorative glass front
panel something we'll talk about later
but courser did improve if you'd like
the height for example here it can go
tall you can take these standoffs off
tip technically but there's really no
reason to do it you just kind of hinder
the airflow so it's a bit taller here
that's beneficial and other than that
this case is really aiming to compete in
at least looks and function with the 11
dynamic which is very much the same type
of case its dual compartment it is a
sort of stout glass tower but the O 11
dynamic comes in at about 130 bucks if
you can find it in stock so that is a
major downside sold out basically always
doesn't include fans but you still
include fans with same price for under
the price of this case and it is water
cooling focused so a few differences
between them the Elevens dynamic is a
case that takes the the cleverest parts
of the 680 acts like putting the power
supply and the other components in a
separate spacious chamber but avoids the
worst part by doing fan mounts on the
front instead of the side the six ATX
has really spacious kale management area
in the back so that's a huge upside
coursers done well there to give you all
the room you want to work with the power
supply the hard drives are
compartmentalized in the back side as
well and this is just something coursers
been doing for years and years now and
isn't new so let's go through Paget's
build notes hit the thermals and noise
section and then talk about the value of
the system first is the door which is a
step up from the old version instead of
for thumb screws the panel is set on
hinges and held shot with the magnet
this is better-looking and a better
functioning option it'd be nice to have
a way to lock the door in place even
more securely during transportation but
that's a minor issue and systems of this
size rarely move anyway
removing the front panel is a more
elaborate process than usual but it's
also unnecessary the filter and fans are
both mounted on a removable
tray and everything else is easily
accessible through the side of the case
fan trays or radiator brackets or
whatever you want to call them are
always an improvement and make for
easier management and make it quicker to
move or mount and dismount multiple fans
if for some reason the panel does need
to be removed it involves removing three
screws from inside the case popping the
plastic section off and removing a
further four screws from outside the
plastic half is held on by metal clips
that function the same way as the
plastic clips and the 280x but are
easier to release despite appearances
the glass pane is still not intended to
be slid out although it could be freed
from its frame by removing many more
screws space is plentiful with the power
supply drives and cables all stuck into
the side compartment which also makes
extra room on three sides of the
motherboard for large cable cutouts
this is especially helpful at the bottom
where intake fans could be mounted
without a power supply or shroud to get
in the way that said cable management
could be better
there are cable tie points inside the
compartment but they're too narrow to
easily accept velcro straps the 280x was
small enough that just providing a place
to stuff the cables was enough but the
680 X deserves a better thought-out
solution like some integrated straps or
larger loops there are a lot of drive
bays but the structures are pretty
flimsy and one of the 3.5 inch drive
sleds in our sample came loose and
shipping not really a big deal but worth
note because it's not the most secure in
the system they are toolless designs but
they could be sturdier no major points
off for this one though
the top glass panel has an extra layer
of standoffs stacked on top so there's
an air gap of about 17 millimeters
between the glass and the chassis as
opposed to about 5 millimeters in the
original 280x the standoffs can be
shortened to bring the glass closer to
the body of the case but there's really
no reason to do that the top panel isn't
removable as one big section like it
wasn't the 280x but that wasn't a
helpful feature in the 280x since there
was another steel plate underneath so it
doesn't count as a downgrade under the
glass section of the 680 X's top panel
is a large empty gap with fan mounts for
2:120 military or 140 millimeter fans
and the filter is packed separately
that's a good move when it comes to our
testing stock numbers won't be
affected by an unnecessary top filter
but it's still there if anyone needs it
both the front and top filters are
simple magnetic mesh rectangles but
they're inset into the surface of the
case in a way that's more thoughtful
than usual both fit flush with their
respective fan cages and are sandwiched
between them and the chassis the bottom
filter is mounted on a plastic frame
that ejects from the side of the case on
the same side as the glass door so
everything that should be easy to access
and clean and sit you the 680 X comes
with four fans three front intake and
one rear exhaust that's plenty and their
place where we would have chosen to put
them so additional tests were limited to
removing the entire front panel and
moving the bottom most intake fan
underneath the right side of the GPU to
see if it would benefit it more although
we're splitting the airflow a bit there
and hedging our bets with some of it
going around the card and up to the cpu
we're starting thermals for just the 680
acts now and then we'll add more
comparative results momentarily the
torture test raised CPU temperature to
fifty eight point six degrees Celsius
and the stock configuration removing the
front panel had a large benefit lowering
the sound of fifty point three degrees
Celsius over ambient for a reduction of
about eight degrees
brute-forcing airflow with three intake
fans is fine
but the case would be much better cooled
without a decorative pane of glass
suffocating them the filter is even
entirely independent of the glass panel
so it could be torn out and the case
would be just as well filtered and
function better that said you can still
have your glass and to eat it too or
well maybe don't eat the glass but you
get the idea a bit more spacing or more
even Inlet space across the entire front
panel would reduce this Delta
meaningfully aesthetics are a valid
concern but it's frustrating to see an
eight point five degree dip just from
removing a completely decorative panel
placing the bottom intake fan under the
GPU may have helped the CPU temperature
a little as well but not outside of the
range of variants it would make sense
since normally it only lives under the
GPU but when it's mounted at the bottom
of the case it can blow some of the air
up towards the CPU as well so of course
there is marketing this as high airflow
as they did in their email to us then it
is misleading marketing at best this is
very much a situation of the age 500p
original
case where it's called I airflow but
it's not comparatively 58 point six
degrees Celsius is about as warm as
cases get on our chart before they enter
runaway thermal territory it's not the
worst but it is placed between these
silence focused dark Bass Pro 900 and
the in wind 303 with half as many fans
the similarly late hour 11 dynamic with
three fans is ranked high with an
impressive forty nine point two degrees
Celsius delta T / ambience because
Leanne Lee didn't bother trying to draw
air through a glass panel and instead
provided a mount on the side of the case
that didn't technically count as a stock
test though since Lee and Lee sent us
fans separately and we installed them as
we saw fit realistically the 11 dynamic
though is cheaper even when adding fans
to the cart and can be made to
outperform the 680 acts readily although
it is smaller than the 680 X while still
remaining somewhat compartmentalized
depending on what you're going for the
11 dynamic may be the better bet it just
depends on if it's got the size and the
look that you want
compared to other cases the 680 X really
isn't impressive out of the box some of
this has to do with the fan choice or
placement but much of it is that the
front panel is a sheet of glass and
isn't really spaced out the way it
should be by dropping temperatures
around 8 degrees the 680 X would land
right around where the Corsair at 570 X
it's still high up on the charts which
is a glass and mesh that uses wide
spacing to allow air intakes everywhere
moving on to GPU temperatures first with
just the 6 ATX GPU delta T or ambient
was fifty two point seven degrees during
stock torture testing and dropped to
fifty one point four degrees with the
front panel removed that's much less
dramatic of a change than on the CPU but
only one of the three fans is pointed at
the GPU and freeing up the airflow
therefore has less of an impact moving
the intake fan below the GPU rather than
in front of it actually sort of raised
temperature a bit by fifty two point
four degrees although it's it's close to
variants but not quite this increases
because it was positioned in the bottom
front area primarily cooling the vrm and
then allowing the rest of the air to
drift up to the CPU positioning the fan
towards the back side more would allow a
more direct GPU cool and you're forcing
air straight into the GPU core area at
that point but it would sacrifice some
of the CPU cooling that we were
trying to save positioning the fan at
the bottom of the case allowed some of
the air to split to the CPU as opposed
to the bottom front where almost all
that goes to the video card the stock
GPU temperature is acceptable looking at
the comparative chart now around the
performance of the H 700 I or the
open-air Corp III by thermal take the
bottom of the case is one big vent free
of PSU clutter and the number of fans
that Corsair includes with the case
means that one of them is fully
dedicated to GPU cooling which is better
than most enclosures we review again the
11 dynamic 3 side fan test isn't exactly
stock but the result was a few degrees
cooler than the 6 ATX GPU temperature
during fire strike was 55 point seven
degrees over ambient slightly above the
torture test that's still near the
middle of the comparative chart but on
the same level as the lackluster
Silverstone PMO to moving multiple
intake fans to the bottom of the case
are switching entirely to a bottom the
top air flow layout would definitely
improve GPU thermals but with the glass
panel at the front of the case CBO
temperatures can't afford to be pushed
much higher blender is used for a
realistic single component workload in
our testing CPU temperature with the
blender tests rendering exclusively on
the CPU was 40 point seven degrees
definitely towards the warm end of the
chart and that's pretty high considering
we're only running a CPU workload and
it's a realistic one at that it shares
its space with the stock defined C which
comes with fewer fans at two and is also
a closed-off case not the measure phi xi
dynamic ran at thirty eight point three
degrees delta T over ambient with three
side fans a smaller gap than in the
torture test but still a noticeable one
for the GPU rendered evie temperature
was twenty seven point seven degrees
Celsius over ambience perhaps on the
warmer side of average the eleven
dynamic did better here again with
twenty five point two degrees but
there's no meaningful difference between
the two they're functionally the same at
this point neither GPU nor cv
temperatures reached anything close to
their maximum but it's good to
demonstrate that even without heavy
synthetic workloads the hardware is
running warmer than it really needs to
finally for noise we measured the 680 X
at forty two point five DBA it could
certainly run quieter with decreased fan
speeds but there are four 120 millimeter
fans and the large air gaps around the
front
I'll do very little to muffle the noise
generated at Matic speed the trouble
with all of this is that the coarser 680
X is not particularly quiet nor
particularly effective at cooling which
is odd since it is named the 680 X RGB
high airflow or at least in the email
that was sent to us originally overall
then coarser calls this at least in its
reviewer material and that it's email a
high airflow case and this is something
we always we have trouble with because
if it's marketed like that and it does
count as marketing when you're sending
reviewers material that potentially
shapes the review and what people say in
the reviews if it's marketed as high
airflow it better be high airflow and
the same is true with be quiet cases for
example so it would be quiet the cases
are almost always targeted towards being
quiet as the name would suggest and so
when we review those we talk primarily
about noise and about if they can still
run at a reasonable temperature it
doesn't have to be the best just
reasonable while being quieter than the
nearby competitors this case isn't going
for that angle it's going for cooling
but it's not particularly competitive
and cooling and also is not competitive
in acoustics
which makes it really for $250 it's just
not good value it's it's poor execution
of the high airflow aspect that Corsair
has promoted three viewers and so for
that we do have to take significant
points off because if you're gonna
market it as or call it high airflow and
it's not high airflow then the case has
failed at what it's being marketed for
the case itself though it is it is high
build quality so we'll give them that
it's got good cable management space the
compartmentalization for people who like
it is great we like these
compartmentalized cases because they're
sort of fun to work with their bit
easier and from a look standpoint it's
not bad either there's really functional
paneling that's easy to work with so
ease of installation features build
quality coursers done a good job but
hitting the marketing target of high
airflow of course there's done frankly a
terrible job because with four fans it
is not even as good as a lot of the
cases on our bench with two fans that
are also quieter so it coarser gets
it's an F for hitting the marketing
deliverables but does okay elsewhere and
that just leaves us with price really
and to say it flat-out give you a really
straightforward answer the O 11 dynamic
gets our buy for this you could buy in
fact 200 11 dynamics for the price of
this case and still have a couple bucks
left over for fans after you account for
shipping and taxes so for sure if you're
looking between the two for some reason
if you consider them direct competitors
even though the price doesn't really
permit it then our choice is the 11
dynamic it's it's just it's cheaper it
does similar things it's got really good
air flow potential if you use the right
fan mounts and you can buy the fans for
still combined under the price of this
case so that's our go-to for this style
of case the 680 X doesn't defend us it's
just that at $250 it's it's too
expensive for what's going on you can
take off the glass front panel that
feels a bit odd it seems sort of naked
when you do that but as a case still
with with the front panel removed
cooling is actually acceptable it's
pretty good on average it's okay and in
the worst cases as opposed to the
current configuration where it's a bad
in the worst cases and you can get it to
acceptable so anyway too expensive for
for missing its main marketing target if
Corsair hadn't marketed it at high
airflow then we could be a bit more
lenient there but we have to look at the
product or at some level what it's
designed to do and it doesn't do what it
says it will do but the rest of its okay
so just too expensive so that's it for
