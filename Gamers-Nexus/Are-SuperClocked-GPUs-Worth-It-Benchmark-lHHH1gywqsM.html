access tonight and today we are looking
at two things that are basically twins
these 750ti and which one of these is
the and the 750ti superclocked now if
you notice I had to actually look at the
card to figure out which is which
because these look identical they are
identical they both have the same
processor they have the genome 107
underneath the hood and the only thing
different is that EVGA has superclocked
this one they superclocked one of them
prior to you receiving it all that means
is that they've pre overclocked it in
this case about a hundred and fifty
megahertz it is a difference between
1020 and 1176 so that's a pretty big
difference but it's it's pretty done for
you so all we're doing today is seen is
it worth it is it worth getting a
superclocked card now this is a small
sample size we're only looking at 750 Ti
is here but we're just going to
extrapolate and and go from there on at
least EVGA Nvidia products in terms of
telling if superclocked is worth fine if
you can just do it yourself and what
does it even gain you for FPS so I keep
having to look at these to figure out
which is which which I think I would
probably be awful at having twins
because I would need the doctor to draw
SC I was I'm sorry which one is super
clocks this is the super clock card it
is a hundred and fifty dollars and you
can get it for about 140 normally with a
rebate the non super clock card is a
hundred and forty dollars tends to be
about 130 128 very best with the rebate
so they're about a twenty dollar
difference on average and that's all
we're looking at is twenty dollars worth
it so let's just dive right into it I
already benchmarked these and the
results here I test with battlefield 4
on high and ultra settings as always
grid Autosport on high and max settings
Metro last light on high with normal
tessellation
Shogun total war Shogun - on the 1080p
benchmark that is built into the game so
that's what we have here I did not test
with watchdogs because I feel like it's
not really realistically representative
because the game is so poorly optimized
so I didn't want to have like a 15 FPS
416 FPS because it's just it's not gonna
tell us anything other than that the
game isn't programs very well for for
this hardware so here's what we have
firstly of battlefield 4 on high
settings and the performance was
actually was it was a pretty big
difference it was about 20% gain with
the superclocked card which is the one
marked with the SC so that one performed
20% better with average FPS 66 versus 54
that's huge because 54 is the difference
between you having to disable one more
setting or change one more setting so
that you can achieve 60 and being able
to run it on properly high settings with
the preset now when we look at the ultra
benchmark we don't have quite as
impressive performance gains it's about
11% from 42 to 47 which is hardly
noticeable you might be able to get a
little bit more out of the superclass
card but that's you know that it's kind
of cutting it close there in grid
Autosport it was actually least
impressive there was a 3% gain on a high
probably because we were potentially
bottlenecking somewhere else and there
was an 11% gain on macs jumping from 43
FPS on the non super clock to 48 FPS
average which again is not necessarily
too noticeable but in the future in a
year from now when you're borderline 50
and 60 FPS that 10% could be a could be
a big gain it just kind of depends how
far out you're looking and what games
you're playing with because obviously
all games will perform differently as
we're seeing here Metro last light we
have a 5 percent gain from 41 to 43 and
not noticeable at all really in this
case and then Shogun total
or two we have an 8 percent gain from 48
to 52 FPS again that is a four-point
swing that's really not going to be
noticeable for the vast majority of
users so I also benchmark thermals just
to see what what's going on here and
surprisingly the superclass card
performs marginally better in all
instances potentially the fan has been
tweaked in some way I am not sure if
EVGA has done any fan tweaking or it
should also be noted that not all
silicon not all semiconductors are
created equal so it's possible that one
of these chips bend out hotter than the
other one
so do keep that in mind with a small
sample size it's pretty hard to just
directly compare them like this for all
intents and purposes they're effectively
identical they're about 2 degrees
Celsius different and that 2 degrees is
hotter on the non super clock card which
tells me that one of the chips probably
bend out hotter than the other one
because I don't see any reason that
should happen to otherwise so is it
worth it well and very best you're
getting 20% on battlefield with high
settings that's pretty that's actually
pretty big that is probably worth if you
look at it in terms of dollars per FPS
you're paying about a dollar 50 ish per
frame gained in that instance going from
55 to 66 or whatever it was actually it
was closer to 2 dollars but that's that
sort of puts it in perspective
I did try overclocked in both these
cards the 750ti non superclocked I was
able to push 150 megahertz over stock
which is what this is very easily and
stabili and I didn't even really have to
touch voltage all that much so what that
means is that assuming all cards are
created each equal which they're not but
let's just assume for a second let's the
case you can overclock this non
superclocked card very easily using
precision or afterburner and push it 100
50 megahertz over stock and you
basically get this and it's $20 cheaper
and you did it yourself
so whether EVGA bends out these chips
differently I don't know if they're
putting a better one in a superclass
card than in the stock card we don't
have that information from them they
were not able to supply it in time for
this vid
you know but if that is the case you you
will benefit potentially from a
superclocked card if you are looking to
overclock further unfortunately due to
issues with the e BD is precision
software right now and and some drama
going on there between them and
rivatuner and the internets which is
always very good at this sort of stuff
and being sarcastic but I was not able
to see how far I could push this due to
issues with voltage and and the software
and not having control over it like I
wanted to so all in all 20 hours
probably worth it if you want to be lazy
it's worth it if you want the the small
gains just for that sort of sake that
peace of mind going into the future
I think practically it's not worth
buying the superclocked card if you're
saving 20 bucks by buying this one
especially because I could so stabili
overclock this one to equate this one
and they perform the same at that point
so I think most users should probably
buy the non superclocked card and save
themselves the bucks if you're gonna pay
$10 to go from that from non
superclocked to superclocked just do it
in my opinion it's it's probably worth
the $10 especially if you're lazy and
you know you're not gonna overclock
anyway and again it gives you that peace
of mind if you're paying more than that
don't bother unless you are sort of the
type of user who doesn't tweak anything
but wants to buy more performance so
that's all I really have to say about
that read the article in the description
below for more information for more
thoughts on this and I will see you all
next time these</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
