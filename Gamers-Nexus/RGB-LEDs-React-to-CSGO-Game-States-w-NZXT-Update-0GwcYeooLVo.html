opening as hosted by iBUYPOWER right now
we're looking at some NZXT stuff we'll
get to the UCI stuff in a bit so this is
a new cam update we are looking at some
RGB lighting effects as interacting with
csgo this particular update is pushed
using the valve API for game states so
when we're talking about game states in
CS things you're looking at or like this
interaction right here you saw the
lights went whitish blue so that will
happen when a flashbang goes off the
player who is running this system is
flashed by the flash man you'll see the
white green is the health and then there
are also game state effects for the bomb
so when c-4 is planted and the timer is
going off it'll tick sort of a yellow
orange when it starts and as the time
nears its its completion the last 10
seconds it'll go red for player health
it's sort of at the bottom of the
priority stack so you can think of this
current Green there at full health
bottle the stack if another game State
event comes in that takes priority over
health like a grenade or c4 then that
goes on top of the priorities list and
takes priority over the health
demonstration this is the c4 effect so
this is the highest priority effect in
the game state api for csgo so that's
always going to take priority over
grenades and then over health in that
order the grenade states that we haven't
covered there's the flashbang one so you
know if a player is flashed there's a
game state effect I think for incendiary
so it'll appear orange if they're in
immense in the area like a fire effect
and then there's also one for smoke
we're all to do sort of a white or an
off blue color when the player is in
smoke so I guess the the consumer use
case of this is it's just kind of cool
it's a way to put your lights to use
this is pretty specifically using the
hue plus setup which is an NZXT product
it plugs into cam so that's what we're
looking at today the wider use case the
one that's kind of interesting and ties
into the UCI esports arena is the
potential deployment for things like
eSports teams so if you have five
players on a stage five versus five each
one has five of these systems
an h 440 envious case just by
coincidence that is a any sports team so
you can see from the actual stage
presence of the machines what the game
state is for a particular player you
know if they're dead if the machines red
so when the player dies the lights will
turn red instead of the green or yellow
or whatever so that's kind of the the
potential actual use case in a
real-world scenario for an eSports event
as for the release date you can expect
the hue plus lighting effect through cam
to come out sometime early October and
there may be some additional game states
that are added in by the NZXT team the
article in the description below will
explain those so as always links on
description below for more information
patreon link to help us out directly
again this is at the UCI esports arena
we will have additional coverage on this
pretty cool stuff in terms of getting
esports in front of the public in a more
direct way thank you for watching
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
