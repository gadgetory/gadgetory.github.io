recap for the past week the first half
of the show is basically the AMD news
show and we have a couple of big items
including AMD working on ddr5 memory and
near memory this is a GN exclusive story
and we'll have more of those later and a
couple of other things following up on
the rx 500 X series of video cards the
AMD veteran Chris hook leaving AMD and
then we have not AMD news about future
mark microcode patches and the
difficulties of modern fabrication
process before that this video is
brought to you by Corsairs new dark tour
RGB se Mouse the dark poor RGB se is a
wireless gaming mouse rated for up to 24
hours of continuous wireless gaming with
the LEDs enabled and can be coupled with
a Qi charging mouse pad for easy battery
charging it has both wireless and
Bluetooth antenna so the mouse can be
used easily on two systems and switched
between them learn more at the link in
the description below
so prior to the news items for the week
a quick update on the mod mats we've
shipped most of them for this round
thank you to all of you who have
purchased some and that includes a
couple of our friends in the media and
reviewers on YouTube who've received a
few I think Joker was probably the first
one to put a tweet out that he was using
it so thank you Joe for trying it out of
course given the current trends in the
industry we did actually pre overclock
the mats and make sure that they can
reach our specification of 5.2 gigahertz
before setting them out so the reviewers
do have higher overclocking mats but the
rest of them are still perfectly good
work services so if you haven't checked
it out go to store that gamers Nexus
dotnet give a look at the new mod map we
have a matte black background now by
which I mean it's literally a black
colored mat and super grippy as a result
we're very happy with this production
run and we're still improving as we go
so yeah we still have a few mats left
from the existing round you can get
those orders in now if you want one they
are shipping as they come in but we do
have another order coming in straight
after that it'll be a bit of a delay if
you put your orders in now that you
should get one before the current rounds
sold out first major news item AMD
working on ddr5 memory and what we
understand it's called near memory so
this is a bit of a jeon exclusive item
we got tipped recent
by a highly credible source that we've
confirmed works at one of the major
memory suppliers so we've got several
stories we can write here but we're
gonna start with this one our present
understanding is that AMD is working
with at least one memory supplier to
establish an RD lab at a AMD's Austin
campus and this labs entire purpose is
through research ddr5 and develop ddr5
for the next generation of system memory
and he's trying to be Intel to the
market with this one and although that's
not necessarily news competitors always
trying to beat each other this is
serious and he really wants to be first
with ddr5 from what we understand so
they've also been the first with several
other memory standards they're now a
consumed ati company that they bought
was the first with several standards for
GDD our video memory so this looks real
DDR 5 is what they're working on now and
separately we also learned that Andy is
working on what they call near memory or
HBM being used in conjunction with
future CPU components so we're not clear
presently on whether that includes
desktop CPUs in the immediate future but
we do know that AMD is working on our d4
HBM for CPUs
not just GPUs and that's actively being
developed so a given hades Canyon that's
not necessarily a big surprise but the
fact that it's coming to AMD processors
is noteworthy for sure and I would
assume at some point you see that in
some level of in the very least a
high-end mobile processor if not desktop
components that the latter would come
much later because does make a lot of
sense in in mobile processing devices
again look at Hades Canyon the next news
item again at AMD item and the veteran
Chris hook has left AMD after 17 years
working their hooks roll at AMD was
within the Radeon Technology Group
previously was at ATI and with an RTG he
served as the senior director of global
product marketing and hook is headed to
a new presently undisclosed position
outside of AMD at the end of April and
they already announced a replacement for
Chris hook and this news comes not long
after Rajat Kaduri left Radeon
Technologies group and went over to
Intel
rajae and Chris Hooke have worked
together for a long time it's possible
that Chris hook goes over to Intel
that's what a lot of the rumors have
stated but there's not really anything
to confirm that right now certainly some
kind of major vendor Qualcomm Intel one
of those is the most likely Chris hook
also if you're not aware was responsible
for a lot of the and the marketing
strategies he was responsible for
organizing a lot of the press technical
events and things like that press events
off-site learning about new products and
is moving over to some other company now
so also was behind a lot of the PR
opportunities and story opportunities as
well so Chris hook definitely played a
big role in the perception of AMD in the
industry and we'll see how his
replacement follows up on that next one
rx 500 x-series so this is more boring
than previously thought as if that were
possible if you thought that rx 500 X
news from last week was boring I've got
something better for you this one is a
basically we thought that the rx 500
x-series which was posted accidently by
an the early would be a pre pre
overclock of Polaris like the rx 500
series was in actuality it's an OEM
rebrand of the rx 500 series with no pre
overclock or pre pre overclock in this
case so the only change is the 500 550 X
the other 500 X cards no changes at all
from what we've seen thus far clock
speeds are the same specs are the same
everything is the same
they're just om rebrands five-hit DX has
a ski that's slightly faster but that's
it so yeah that was a much more boring
than expected next one industry
challenges with seven nanometer and five
nanometer process for fabrication the
timelines for shrinking process nodes
and the evolution of semiconductor
manufacturing maybe reaching new
challenges there bit in question now if
they weren't already and this is given
trouble specifically that Intel AMD have
already had and Tom's been struggling
for quite a while now to get 10
nanometer working the way they want a
report out of EE times echoes the
sentiment that doesn't seem to be a
magic bullet for the ills of
manufacturing at 5 nanometer and 7
nanometer
with UV lithography random defects are
popping up in the form of imperfect
holes tears and lines shorts wear holes
or lines meet and worse yet it allegedly
takes days to find these anomalies and
imperfections on silicon this small this
makes defects and yield a chief concern
at five nanometers and seven animators
foundry processes and company roadmaps
targeting 20/20 with optical shrinks
could be out of the window now
next up future mark recently announced
that they will further integrate with ul
or underwriters laboratories citing
their merger in 2014 on April 23rd 2018
future mark will become UL benchmarks
additionally all social media accounts
will be rebranded and their website will
be relocated to benchmarks UL com aside
from the looks future Marcus shares
everything else will remain the same
benchmark brands such as 3d mark PC
Marquette cetera purchased benchmarks
and benchmark scores will all remain the
same and will continue to receive
support any processors also just
received a Windows patch aimed at
mitigating the specter variant -
vulnerability at the operating system
level this is following several Intel
patches which have had somewhat murky
launches they've been issued and recalls
and things like that AMD is just pushing
some of theirs now though Andy has
published micro code updates for their
processors dating back to 2011 and that
starts with the first line of bulldozer
based CPUs specifically the OS level fix
takes the form of I read it here KB for
0 9 3 1 1 2 and centers around to
indirect branch prediction barriers and
and the chips and he has also released a
white paper citing their Specter efforts
and detailing what they're doing to
mitigate and hopefully deal with all
those vulnerability exploits and
concerns in laptop news asus is
preparing to trot out three new laptops
speculatively aimed at the esports crowd
these include the ROG Strix GL 503 GL
703 and tough gaming FX 504 these models
offered two different CPU configurations
and i-5 8300 h or i 78758 all models
pair the Intel coffee-like CPU with
either a
50 or 10 50 TI both the tough gaming FX
504 and ROG Strix GL 503 offer a 120
Hertz TN display the GL 703 offers a 60
Hertz IPS display and all displays are
1080p different storage and memory
options of course are available for all
models no word on pricing or
availability as of now the last major
news item is on Corsairs release of a
new high-end dominated platinum series
the previous one was the Dominator
platinum se torque and the new one is
the special edition contrast the ddr4
modules feature basically recognizable
Dominator heat spreaders and this time
they've got some black and white
aesthetic going on worthy of the
contrast namesake it's it's creative
they're working on it regardless the 32
gigabyte kits are based on Samson's beat
IIC is something that everyone should be
paying attention to right now and only
come in 32 gigabyte capacities in both
dual and quad channel configurations out
of the box the kit runs a ddr4 3466
frequency with XMP on with timings major
timings configured to 16 18 18 36 and of
course there's new kit if you're
wondering rights at $440 for 2 by 16
gigabytes or 480 for 4 by 8 gigabytes
