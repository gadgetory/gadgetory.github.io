several turrets guarding the stage so
many jerks trying to storm the stage and
steal our precious bodily fluids
wait
everybody's pointing in an apple and I
ok so what Jonathan Coulton bit into
this Apple or some it's the Holy
Apple of Antioch you realize the DNA
contained in this Apple you could grow
an army of set bearded musicians which
is my ZZ Top
I have too many items I have to drop
something jaago jaago I'm sorry I just
watched my brain and again good thing
with it I was going to say I'm going to
juggle a thousand-dollar wireless
microphone an apple with a bite out of
it and an open bottle of water around a
bunch of electronics that'll end well
for everybody involved okay no here's
what we're gonna do
less worse skee-ball ever I totally

lying wrist springsteen cover band I
think it's a bigger cheer that was
