nexus donna and once again at PAX Prime
2013 this is day two yesterday actually
last night we published a pax cast that
talked briefly about SSD overclocked in
which we did right here in this lab area
of the Intel booth and I'm joined by
Justin Whitney today from Intel's SSD
marketing division we're going to be
talking more about the SSD overclocking
feature why it's relevant what you can
do with it and maybe even if you can
expect it anytime soon it is currently
in a prototype phase justin can you give
me like a quick top-level overview of
SSD overclocking yeah what we're really
what we're really doing at PAX
this year is we were really excited to
come for the first time ever and talk
about an SSD overclocking technology
we're not necessarily saying we've got a
product coming anything like that
more important to us was the gauge both
tech press like yourself so as as well
as the attendees reaction to that kind
of technology we're not even sure that
the market wants something like that but
we've been playing around with a
prototype and wanted to get that that
kind of reaction from our target
audience and so far how has the reaction
been from your end users I'm actually
shocked at how positive it's been we sat
down with some IT pros from data centers
yesterday and they were like why
wouldn't we want to do this and we've
thought well I mean if there was any any
chance or possibility at all to corrupt
data by pushing a frequency too high or
something like that wouldn't you be
really risk adverse to that type of
situation they were like you know well
we would go through do a lot of
validation on our end
you know tune performance to get higher
AI ups lock it down and when it's stable
I think we pushed it too hard we'd back
it off and do it again so that was a you
know the biggest surprise or shock for
me at the at the show so far end users
and we're surrounded by overclockers
that take like a case cube processor
like the new 4770k
they're pushing it they're like give me
another knob that's awesome let me go
till it breaks I don't care
six months I'm gonna replace it anyway
you know so so far everything's been
really positive
as far as actual functionality what can
we overclock what utility are we using
to overclock it a really good question a
part of this technology demonstration is
we're looking at a beta version of
Intel's extreme tuning utility so you
know any any system with that with an
Intel chipset has the ability to
overclock memory and graphics processor
settings that sort of thing they put a
beta feature in just press these they're
gonna show it at Intel's its Developer
Forum next week as well through through
that beta feature next to you
we're looking at two settings on the
drive the the ASIC or the controller
itself we've got a pretty write wide
range of frequency settings for for that
part of the drive and then we look at
the NAND channel bus so you have all
these flash parts soldered down and what
frequency are they talking to the
controller as well so the controller and
then the NAND the nand channel frequency
as well so two knobs and they both have
a little bit different impact on
performance as far as actual performance
gains percentages stuff like that what
can we expect with overclocking SSDs
well one no no promises on anything here
okay true prototype status no commitment
to product or anything else so numbers
or you know just show and tell purpose
right now depending on which setting
which benchmark you're running and even
which system you're sitting on with
these prototypes right now we've seen
some increases in the 20% range
specifically in IEEE ops IAP reads we've
been seeing go up quite a bit in the end
the writes as well so about about 20 10
to 20 so far it sounds pretty good so
far so for one of the biggest questions
will be getting is about endurance can
you talk to us about endurance what your
if you have any predictions or if you
have any
and anything you're specifically looking
at reinforcing there we have no formal
validation runs that anything that I
would put any numbers associated to
short answer I would say any time you
start overclocking the performance of a
drive you're probably gonna have a
trade-off with endurance or the life of
the product
how much probably is going to be
dependent on how far we allow you to
push it are we gonna allow you to you
know if it went to market would we let
you go so far that you're going to cut
the drives life in half I doubt we'd
want to be there and we'd have a lot of
upset end users unless we disclaim the
heck out of it
okay you go to this you know this
setting and you know you're you've cut
it in half I don't know where we're
gonna be argue our guess is there's
gonna be some trade-off and that's
actually one of the questions we've got
for everyone at PAX is what would you do
you know if you could get 20% in
performance would you give up 20% life
or you know is that not something you
want to mess with so it's totally
variable depending on how much you push
the drive have there been any any
discussions at Intel about ksq SSDs or
anything like that with unlocked
overclocking features a discussion sure
we're gonna call it a case queue I don't
know if that was part of your question
discussions yeah we haven't decided any
of that if we don't even up we'll go to
market right but I think in terms of the
case queue Association there's some
really strong affinity there even in
terms of you know do you do you unlock
it overclock it and then do you void
your warranty if you had a product I
think this is going to be very similar
to that I would I would imagine so so
you'd likely validate at a known good
frequency and that's what you warranty
and if you want to push it further you
may be on your own
and some pretty strong disclaimers would
be back up your data first
you know don't put anything important on
here while you're setting you know going
through and testing your settings and
then once you have it locked down
you know then get your your favorite
games and your files and that sort of
thing very cool so I think we've talked
about it quite a bit now can you show us
what's going on here oh it love - let's
do it all right all right guys so after
you know tuning some of the performance
settings while we take a look at the
results we have three different
comparisons that were up that we have up
on the screen right now this this bottom
score 806 was from our intel SSD 520
series there's one you can talk about
specs for sequential reads and writes
and then give me some you know some real
incompressible data test it out what is
reality in this case I think we're you
know we're seeing some some bus
saturation in some regards we're you
know about 500 megabytes per second on
reads we're not impacting that a whole
lot the writes we got to go up from like
286 megabytes a second on our 520 series
up to 415 on our prototype and then once
we started overclocking that we got
another you know another 10% or so on
those rights maybe a little under that
but if we look at the random scores
that's where it gets really interesting
so I'm gonna switch to AI ops instead of
megabytes a second so from that
perspective we had about 60,000 AI ops
for random reads and writes on that 520
series and then when we looked at the
prototype default settings on that we
jumped up to 75,000 or so overclocked it
took it up to 88 almost 89 thousand
really big IAP scores
you know really nice to jump from our
520 series you know high-end client
drive up to just stock settings now
there was 10 percent or more on that and
then another 10 percent or higher on
after we started overclocking it really
depends on the settings I think what did
we calculate we were 18 to 22 percent on
random scores and increasing for those
reads and writes so kind of a fun little
experiment at this time what do you guys
think I'd really like to know what your
viewers think - yeah I think personally
I think it's pretty cool it's pretty
exciting if you have any thoughts or
comments leave them in the in the
comment section below and of course
tweet at Intel gaming or at gamers Nexus
and thanks for the overview Justin we
will see you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
