report from asrock I actually lit it on
fire is maybe more correct so as you'll
see in the b-roll it's actually got some
burnt-out traces from the 24-pin power
and I'm suspicious I'm not sure if this
is from the board from the power supply
or from the CPU I have a feeling it's
from the motherboard because I tested
the CPU and other boards am3+ boards and
it worked fine
the power supply seems fine I already
tested that I'm going to show you in
this video how we tested it and so that
leaves us with the board and this board
is not particularly good it's it's just
problematic in a lot of ways and one of
them is obviously traces that light on
fire apparently so what happened was I
was testing this on our open-air bench
just like that had the CPU in it I was
testing the Wraith cooler this is a
couple weeks ago testing the Wraith
cooler and before it even got to BIOS I
smelled smoke or fire and so normally in
the past when I've smelled that it's
just dust burning out of the power
supply I was a power supply I hadn't
used in a while so kind of just figured
that was it but nope no BIOS no video
tried for a little while
touch the pump on the CL see when I was
testing that and found that the pump was
not powered so either the pump was dead
or the board was problematic and we
found out it was the bore hit it because
it wasn't supplying power to anything
and that's because when I took it off
the bench and look to the underside that
the traces were lit on fire and they
definitely smelled like it so we're
gonna check out some of the power supply
testing that we're doing to basically
validate that this thing is is a
motherboard problem and for that we have
our fancy anti-static proof workbench
right here that's what that blue stuff
is it's an ESD mat I've got the power
supply pin out this is a pin out that
shows where the 12 volt lines are three
and a half or 3.3 volt lines are rather
5 volt ground all that stuff and I'll be
checking that against our power supply
with with a multimeter it's got a
multimeter got a power supply and we got
a paperclip
you probably shouldn't pick power
supplies up like this by the way
so we've got all those I need my my
paperclip of course we got the paperclip
and this as you probably may have seen
an ancient video of ours is used to jump
the power supply so you jump a a green
and a black pin from the 24 pin header
that will start the power supply without
actually needing to plug it into a
motherboard and hit the power button so
for testing the power supply all I'm
gonna do is see if the voltage coming
out of this 24 pin header is correct is
it about 12 volts and the 12 volt lines
is about 3.3 the three and is it about 5
volts and the 5 volt lines that's pretty
easy to do with colored wires this power
supply does not have the colored wires
which is really nice aesthetically this
is a what animatics has done basically
to they've braided their cables so they
have braided cables and that means that
we need the pin out chart that I have on
the wall which you normally don't need
of course but we do in this case because
we're jumping this with a back with a
paperclip
so you don't want to jump there on pins
make sure you're certain what is the
correct pin because if you do the wrong
ones you could kill the power supply or
hurt yourself and for this one I already
know that we're basically starting
there's a blank pin over here we're
gonna start a few to the right of that
just right of the the clip here this
little clip that grabs the motherboard
so I am gonna plug in our paperclip in
the correct green and black and I
actually just heard the power supply
tick on to me that electrical current
tick and normally it's pretty easy to
just look at the fan in the power supply
and see the fan spins up this animatics
power supplies fanless which is great in
every instance except this one so we can
plug in a 120 millimeter fan I've got
plenty of those I'll plug that into the
molex and if that spins up we know the
power supply is on alright so I've got a
fan so 120 millimeter fan we're gonna
put that over here and you can see I
have kind of jerry-rigged vanes the fan
only has a three pin header so I've
connected it to a 3 pin 2 molex and I'm
going to connect that to the power
supply and once we do that I just saw
try to spin once we connect that so the
fan has spun up that means the power
supply is obviously providing power
through this jumped pin that's what's
triggering
the start loops basically electrically
it's triggering it to turn on and supply
power so now we can take the multimeter
set that to voltage DC because
everything coming out of this is DC
voltage or DC power rather what's coming
from the wall is AC or alternating
current the power supply converts it to
direct current and direct current DC
comes out of here so we're talking for
DC voltage with a multimeter and I'm
just gonna take these probes and then
check a ground against a hot wire
surrounded check the ground against the
three-point-three ground against a five
volt i ground against the 12 volt which
normally reads between 11 and 12 and
with eleven point nine five or something
and I know those just from the chart
that we have on the wall
so I know which pin is what and we'll be
able to check the voltage on the readout
and see is this power supply providing
the correct voltage now a quick note
sometimes these power supplies have
regulators in them which is a good thing
normally but it means that the voltage
may not be fully supplied there may
actually be no power provided at all if
there's no load generated so that's what
these fans come in for it will require
some kind of kick from the power supply
because it's gotta generate over power
output its power the fan you can plug in
a hard drives if you're not getting
power still because those do drop more
so that's the process for determining if
the power supply is good and this one is
and I know the CPU is good because I
tested the CPU and other an 3 plus
motherboards so we're basically left
with the motherboard is awful and burned
and dead so that's garbage it will
probably end up on a shelf or a wall in
the background of the set from now on
because it has no functional use left in
its life but just a quick insight the
how some of the testing goes how it
works behind the scenes when we blow
stuff up because it does happen quite
often and just as a side note ESD by the
way is real that's why we have these
mats this one's not technically plugged
in right now
you do basically drive a screw through
the mat that connects to a mesh on the
inner layer and that helps ground it
when you plug the opposite end of the
screw which is normally terminates in a
power cable into the grounding pin at an
outlet
we'll talk about that in a future video
but that keeps everything safe so we
know it was an ESD that killed the
motherboard it was just something screwy
between the the CV and the board it's
if it was an AMD an three-plus very hot
cpu so those things are kind of tricky
sometimes
