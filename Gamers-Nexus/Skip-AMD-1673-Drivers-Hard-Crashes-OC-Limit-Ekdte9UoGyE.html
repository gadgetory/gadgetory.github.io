16.7 dot 3 a.m. the driver we were
alerted by one of our Twitter followers
thank you by the way early in the day
that the new driver 16 up 7.3 has an OC
limitation that was not previously
present and that is on memory
specifically for the rx 480 and
obviously in the future presumably any
other rx series card so what's happening
is this the original memory overclock
had a ceiling of 20 to 50 megahertz
which we show in our rx 40 review and
with 16.7 dot 3 that limit is dropped
down to 20 50 megahertz that's the new
ceiling with this particular driver
which is for every card I've tested and
everyone I've seen tested lower than its
actual theoretical max I think our card
was hitting 2200 megahertz in our
official review so that would drop that
rate down somewhat substantially from
the 2200 to 2050 100 50 megahertz Javid
memory overclocked now in terms of
gaming performance you're not looking at
that big of a difference so this isn't
some huge cry of shame on AMD's part
it's not like they're stealing
performance from you but it is a
curiosity as to why the the frequency
overclock has been limited and so I
reached out to AMD we decided to wait
until contacting them and see if we get
a response before doing any kind of
video republication and what I got from
them was first of all right now as we
film this
they have QA team Quality Assurance
looking into the issue of the the driver
frequency limitation that's going on at
1673 and Andy said that they are first
checking to confirm if this is an issue
at all a problem and then once that's
confirmed it will of course come down to
a question of when does the driver get
updated to maybe 16.7 of 3.1 hotfix or
something like that to resolve the issue
it was not revealed to us if Andy sees
this as an intentional change or if it
was completely unintentional or a bug or
whatever but they are acknowledging that
some users have present
this as an issue and and they are
looking into it actively so it's not
like this is just being ignored and
there's silence from Andy on the matter
in terms of what's going on I tested it
myself just a bit ago with an MSI rx 480
and also with a reference are X 480 the
press sample and we're seeing the same
issue on both cards and then the is if
you roll back the drivers to 16.7 dot
one or two I think was the public
release then the issue is gone the
overclock is again peaked at twenty to
fifty megahertz rather than twenty fifty
so it is a driver related thing and Andy
is looking into this in terms of
performance again just to reiterate this
isn't something that I'd go burning down
the towers over because it is a pretty
small issue in the scheme of things it's
really just a removal of some of the fun
of overclocking of course that sucks but
it does look like it's potentially an
accident so I just say if you're on 16.7
dot two or I think that was a public one
if you're on 1672
then definitely just hang out there for
a little bit and grab sixteen seven
three dot X when a hotfix is released
and I say that because it's more than
just memory overclocking that's an issue
here a bigger issue that I discovered
and I haven't seen I haven't gotten a
response from AMD yet on this but we're
having problems with a hard crash in GTA
v with 1673 so when testing the MSI 480
which we're trying to review right now I
was getting issues where the screen
would just completely freeze and we had
to do a full system shutdown to get back
into Windows it wasn't it was there was
no soft fix so that is certainly an
issue that is one reason I'm
recommending just stay on sixteen seven
to an update later once everything's
resolved because it seems like there's
some other stability issues there and we
had some white screen issues where the
desktop would just turn completely white
just while on the desktop with 1673 and
that is not present when I roll back to
seven to so as far as our review goes
the MSI our X 480 will be reviewed on
1672
you and other drivers as relevant but
I'm going to be throwing away the
results that we've already taken for
1673 because I can't get stability with
a lot of games for anymore than the
benchmark so that's not a valid test in
my opinion so that's it that's all we
got for you quick news update on the and
the drivers again just wait see what
happens we'll update you if there's
anything relevant but most like is just
gonna be in a driver push with the
hotfix in which case check and gamers
exit on that for that news because it's
by not worth doing a video on if if that
comes out so page on like push well
there you go in a house out directly and
subscribe for more content I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
