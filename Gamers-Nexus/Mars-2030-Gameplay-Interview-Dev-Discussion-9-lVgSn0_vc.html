dotnet and I'm joined by Julian Ray's
fusions that lead VR producer working on
Mars 2030 so we saw Mars 2030 yesterday
or the day before in the keynote and can
you sort of bring everyone up to date
what is Mars 2030 before we dive into
the details yeah
March 2030 is basically a culmination of
the latest in research that NASA has
been working on for a mission to Mars we
integrated it into unreal engine to
create an experience for everybody to
kind of become an astronaut and go on
Mars and this is a more gameplay side
question so we're talking about this pre
interview where as many of the viewers
know a lot of the VR experiences right
now are cool for sort of a limited time
and you sort of run out of things to do
what I played very limited ly with the
Mars 2030 demo seems more open world so
what's what sort of dirt game design
philosophy what are you planning to have
for people to actually do in-game okay
and I'll backtrack a little bit and add
it something to that so the whole
purpose is to make you feel like an
astronaut you know so when you're when
you're in that this experience you have
the freedom of going and exploring Mars
and going on different missions so in
that process it having an open-world
environment really just just doesn't
confine you to this to this track where
you have to go and explore and instead
you're you you're traveling a few miles
out and you discover these like a lava
tube opening that takes you to different
places and and we and in that I think
there's there's a lot of excitement
because not only is it an open world but
the things that you find challenge the
expectations of what you'd expect to
find on Mars and and we really want to
do that because when you when you play
any any Mars or or when you see Mars all
you see is the Red Planet
but we want to go a step ahead of that
and say okay well what else what are the
highlights what were the compilation
compilation of the best of Mars and so
you get to see all those things in the
experience very cool what about missions
and things like that yeah so we're
building out several different missions
for our full release each one addresses
a specific goal for NASA's reasoning to
go to Mars one of them is to basically
uncover Mars is history and and and look
for the existence or past existence of
life and then the other is ultimately to
kind of the first baby step in in in
establishing a human presence on the on
the red plane or on other planets it's
it's the first step into doing that and
this graphically was comprised of I
guess photogrammetry of sort of
satellite flybys yeah we used a lot of
data that NASA pointed us out to
University of Arizona's high-rise data
which they'd flown satellites over to
Mars and and kind of captured the
closest data to get them up the most
realistic landscape as possible so
that's an interesting point is realism
since we obviously haven't personally
been there how do you deal with things
like color accuracy or physically making
the object or the interactions with the
rover how do you deal with that being as
accurate as possible
we we fact check almost everything I we
and we have tons of reference imagery
we're using the the real Martian colors
with some of the Mars images that you
see now that they add a little bit of
blue to be able to distinguish different
rocks that you see on Mars so but we
want to be as true to life as possible
and even though no one's ever been on
Mars before we're aiming to put you on
Mars as best as possible so that's all
on Unreal Engine 4 right that's correct
and is there anything special you're
doing with Jensen brought up physics so
physical simulation of the rover wheels
did you talk to NASA about that or how
did you figure that out no we actually
got to drive the rover at Johnson Space
Center and we got a feel for what it was
and how it works and then some
our developers put together a Nvidia
physics system to be able to kind of map
out each individual wheel and since the
rover for purposes of never getting
stuck anywhere because you don't want to
get stuck on Mars basically it can
rotate and it could also strafe so you
have to integrate that and and
there wasn't that previously and and we
had to kind of put that all together
very cool what about so you were talking
about color accuracy using these
different I guess looking at like a blue
filter to bring out more detail on the
rocks what about things like PBR and
lighting what sort of advanced graphics
technologies are you using well in terms
of lighting we've been kind of deciding
on whether we're gonna use dynamic or
baked baked lighting it's just an issue
with with with framerate and VR we want
it we definitely want to push on on the
visual output and so we've opted for one
stationary light that basically
illuminates the whole experience and and
a lot of our environment artists have
been working to kind of add PBR to all
the models including the habitats we
were working to get PBR there and just
so so it comes to life and it really
makes a difference when you when you
start adding those those elements in
right so in terms of development
timelines things like that you guys look
at the support the vibe and the rift you
know when are you looking to launch yes
at the moment we we want to be as device
agnostic as possible and and let
everybody enjoy and not not only have a
vr version but a non-vegan as well so
that anybody that just wants to be an
astronaut can give it a shot
how about release window we're aiming at
October of this year very cool so for
more information hit the link in the
description below and we've got an
article from the initial unveil of mars
2030 with steve wozniak I was pretty fun
and then more information from today so
check that out and as always patreon
like the post roll video helped us out
directly and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
