Edition Cardon which is a pro targeted
card that precedes the launch of our X
Vega the gaming targeted card already
run us through a few initial tests and
now we're going to tear it down and show
you what the inside looks like go
through the cooling solution and then
we'll have a PCB vrm analysis from build
Zoid going up within the next 48 hours
if not sooner
so for this card it was $1,000 we bought
it ourselves and II did not sample this
one too many media if any media and that
means that this is brought to you by our
patreon backers who have helped when we
need to buy samples ourselves so you go
to patreon.com/scishow and acces if
you'd like to help us out directly or
store doc gamers nexus dotnet if you
like this coverage and want to support
our independent journalism so started
with the card on the outside it is and
what looks like an anodized aluminum
finish and it is a unibody bent finish
over the top and on the back the card is
actually still quite warm because it
just got done with something our whole
testing what's the stock thermal paste
on there so we have numbers for that
already but not sharing them just yet
that'll come soon enough
it does seem like the body of the card
acts as somewhat of a heatsink though so
you'd probably want some airflow
directed on the card to dissipate some
of that heat that is accumulated in the
shell but we'll go through the internals
in a moment I haven't actually seen it
yet big blower fan on the end this goes
up to forty nine hundred rpm and it
seems to sit in the 40 to 50 percent
range for its RPM when it's under a
heavier workload like blender or
something that we're having trouble
getting that to complete without
crashing but again that will come to
review back side you've got the aluminum
backplate with giant support structure
for the cooler and then the Vega logo
but we can just start tearing it down at
this point
so the only thing left is rear i/o and
that's all pretty standard so let's
start with removing the backplate or the
screws in the back plate anyway we've
got an LED here that has only two
indicators on/off and then on the other
side red and blue and then we have a GPU
tachometer which shows the GPU load
these screws look to be which size is
this TR six size
so we've got a torque 6 size for these
let's say warranty boy from youth and
don't do that and there are one two
three four five six of these alright so
that was easy enough
there's your back plate there are no
thermal pads on it
these are bumpers to prevent vibration
of the back plate against the PCB and
also to prevent contact although these
one is millimeters standoffs do a good
job of preventing any potential contact
anyway so you won't be shorting anything
and I believe this is anodized anyway
but that's the that's back plate easy
enough so 6t are six screws and I
haven't actually taken this apart yet so
I'm lining this with you now we have
Phillips Phillips all Phillips it looks
like and TR what are these five TR five
up here for that part of the shroud that
might not need to come out maybe it's
four LEDs and then we have Phillips
heads in the back so I'm going to get an
anti-static wrist strap on just because
we need this card and bought it
ourselves so it matters this time okay
so we've got an anti-static wrist strap
on these aren't 100% necessary but we've
got a grounded mat and no need for a
very stupid reason to kill the card
which would be static electricity so
we've eliminated that from this part and
this is plug straight into the ground as
well so that's all good these Phillips
heads are a pH zero one size with the
iFixit kit that we're using I'm just
going to kind of hit all of them about
half way and then go through the rest
actually you know what what I'm going to
do instead is remove the four for the
GPU because a lot of the time these are
connected directly into the only part
that actually needs to be remove them
and the rest are just for some base
plate or something okay okay there's the
retention kit the screws are stuck in
there so that's different from the GTX
cards we see most often and let's get
these out of there now these probably
hold the
plate in the 40 spots against the rest
of their tension for the GPU does it
come off no asbestos pecked that these
three might be for the ERM fan so we're
going to leave that off or leave those
on until the very last moment
that's the compromising okay okay so
let's get we're going to just go ahead
and take these out place permanent
barcode and serial number or product
label here oops
they've got that one and like I said
this is the first time we're taking this
apart so it may well be the case that
some of these screws do not need to be
removed oh there's a hidden screw it
there to get the card to release the
shroud but it is it is easier to just
kind of take them all out if you haven't
done it before so you can prevent any
damage from prying at things
all right that's everything is feeling
pretty loose now another screw on this
side right here sure what's holding us
in the fan is at least by the way so
those three are for the fan which means
that you don't have to take them off but
that's fine hmm I don't see any okay
it might be an unnecessary step but just
to eliminate something kinda dumb we're
going to take these out oh that's
looking promising by the way on the
front side of this card there are a
couple screw holes as well that are
unused presently I'm not sure if there
will be partner models of this version
of the card that might be why those
would be there but these right here
we've seen them on plenty of cards in
the past but oh there we go
okay so the secret is to take all the
outer screws out I think we actually
jumped the gun a bit this shell you can
get off just by pulling the tr-5 screws
these ones right here out of the side of
the body at which point you're you'll
release the shell and then we're just
connected by a an LED cable down there
it'll deal with momentarily
so here's everything's going to be loose
because I've taken all the screws out so
giant blower fan like I said this is
this is one of the bigger ones you've
seen it also has a pretty high RPM it's
got I'm not sure if that's aluminum or
not but got the
we finish on the middle I can see the
chokes already two of them we're going
to disconnect the fan early in this
process okay cut that out safely okay
large aluminum thin stack on top of a
copper plate underneath how do I release
this or is it already released it was
that a bio switch can you get a close on
that one that might be a bio switch I'm
thinking so that's a BIOS toggle on a
reference card that's kind of neat
it is a thousand-dollar reference card
but still would be kind of neat I
believe it might be but I'm not positive
a bill died we'll have that answer for
you definitively in his coverage on our
channel so this aluminum sink is oh I
was just about to say it's a it's
definitely not soldered on because I
could see the paste and I could see the
pace starting to spread out the sides of
it but it was basically glue okay so
huge die we're going to measure that for
you in a second I know that's been a big
question for everyone let's get rid of
this fan so for my own reference the fan
cables going through the square-ish
rectangle hole that's going to be the
bottom right of the card so that'll be
good for reference move that to the side
move that to the side okay so where are
our thermal pads oh that's right this is
a HBM you know it's been a while since
I've looked at an HB M card so for a
moment I was like where where's the beer
am why have my seen inductors everywhere
that's why it's HBM to but it's been so
long since I've seen an HB M card opened
the P reacts being the last one that
took me a minute so we've got into the
inductors are contacting through thermal
pads to an aluminum base plate this
matte black plate is aluminum and we've
got a small thin stack over here through
which air will go from the blower fan
mounts right here
and that stack is at the back of the
card
on top of the display port out so that's
going to heatsink that the i/o and also
just help spread heat in general from
the area we've got kind of a ramp up
here which is probably for either
acoustics or airflow direction reasons
certainly not for aesthetics because
you're never going to see that part of
the card this is fairly standard this
keeps all the air blowing in a tunnel
like effect that direction don't need to
cool this side of the card so it is left
uncooled directly by the fan but then is
a squirrel page scroll cage ie blower
fan and does it have any information 12
volt 2 point 4 amps nothing special
Delta electronics and it does go to 4900
rpm in our initial testing so there's
the fan and there's this base plate
these contacts these inductors so
inductor contact there and then is that
inductor contact it oh let's see a wrong
way that might that's actually the
MOSFETs
okay so fats and doctors and then some
breathing it looks like for the caps
okay so let's move this to the side
we've got that inside of the shell
nothing special there's an LED board PCB
for the LED that's here and also here
that's all that is so that can be moved
aside as well so look at this part
aluminum fin stack flat fins on the top
makes sense you don't need any
ventilation from the top so if they can
trap it and allow the air to get forced
that direction out the back of the case
and all the better you can see some of
the fin density and pitch here then
pitch is standard 90 degrees then
density is
is also fairly average looking underside
so the underside is a copper base plate
with a copper protrusion this is all one
piece of copper the protrusion is
contact and actually you can see the
imprint before I wipe it off there's an
imprint of the HBM right there and right
there
so we can see the HBM stacks and then
here's the actual die stack right there
and that's contacting the GPU proper
with these going through the backside
now what is this little protrusion for I
wonder is it basically a tiny tiny heat
pipe or what just go like this
I guess I can look at the imprints yes
this goes like this okay that looks like
the world's tiniest heat pipe over there
or something or just a manufacturing
imperfection I'm actually not not sure
but we'll we'll get the snail-pace now
off of the card and look at the rest of
the important stuff I think that is
actually that is a heat pipe in fact or
it's something like that so all right
let's look at the card I need to get
some rubbing alcohol I've already tested
this thermal paste so we'll be putting
our own on after it for our other
standardized thermal tests then won't
concrete I look at that stuff geez
Andy doesn't like to put the name on the
dye so this will be rather boring if
that's the case again but we already
know what it is anyway so all we really
need to do is measure the dye and do a
separate video on the power and vrm
layout
all right let's measure this dye no
words on it so we're just going to go
straight to measuring the dye and the
lower two parts
that's your HB m stacks right there all
16 gigabytes so 8 gigabytes per stack
the HP m and then there's the actual
Vega dye digital part of my digital
calipers is not working try and be as
accurate as I can here without not
scratching or anything like that so if
you zoom in down where the calipers are
touching dye and then show the
millimeter reading everyone can see it's
roughly 22 maybe 20 point something and
now the other side
so you can see there that's about 20 25
to 26 each tick is one millimeter and
now for total package Heights which
always interest me for modding to be a
little careful with this measurement we
can subtract the PCB height so it's not
going to be the most accurate but it'll
be close enough so our PCB is about one
one millimeter thick so we're going to
subtract that from the dye height this
this side can be easier
okay package height off of the PCB let's
call it a bit extra because they can't
quite touch that somewhere in that area
and then for the total package size
accounting the interpose we're at 30 by
30 so this is a 30 by 30 pack die this
this entire width by this entire height
this is 30 by 30 and then if anyone's
curious just go ahead and measure the
HBM 10 by 11 or 12 okay so that's all
the measurements or 10 by 11 or 12 on
that let's let's call it 12 on the HBM
now let's let's do the mounting hole
distance next for your cue liquid coin
enthusiasts so we're at 60 1 2 3 4 60 4
is a square we'll find out I guess so 64
by I'm going to rotate this so everyone
can see it
1 2 3 4 is that really 5 sometimes odd
what's that say 1 2 3 4 that looks like
64 to me yes that's 64 question is is
this also 64 64 by 64 there's your
mounting hole difference if you want to
liquid cool this that is the answer
that's it for this one this is as bare
as it gets this is the Vega card
frontier edition Fe so Vega Fe we've got
full benchmarks on it coming and hold on
to your purchases before you see that
they will give somewhat of an indication
to rx Vega but it's not our X beta so
we'll have to test that separately when
it actually ships but that's what we
have for now
so you've seen the die you've got all
the measurements for the mounting holes
for liquid cooling you have the
measurements for the die size rough
measurements for the die height but
don't don't go mass-produce water clocks
based on those knockers and vrm is
coming separately along with testing
we're probably doing thermal power
noise first and then gaming immediately
after that so do subscribe to the
channel if you are not so you can catch
all that coverage as it goes live and if
you want to help us out directly with
this type of thing in the future please
go to patreon.com/scishow in this video
were suggestions from the community
because they wanted to know you all
wanted to know what the different dye
size measurements mounting hole
measurements and things like that were
so we do listen to your suggestions for
these and thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
