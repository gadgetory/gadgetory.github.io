nexus dotnet and today we're talking
about October's most played pc games as
measured by Raptor now raptor of course
is not the most used social platform in
gaming but it does give us a good
cross-section of the pc gaming world
right now and sort of relatively what
the most popular titles are so first of
all we've got League of Legends Holdings
drawn in first place as the most played
pc game for october and really the rest
of the time that it's existed and it
currently holds about twenty-two percent
of the total share of players on raptors
service that is a massive chunk of the
user base World of Warcraft is measured
at eight point five percent of the share
do note that the WoW expansion that just
shift the Warlord's expansion is not not
counted in this because it's shipped in
November so we won't have those metrics
until next month in December and I'm
curious to see how far Wow rises as a
result of that dota 2 of strong at five
point six percent csgo actually rose a
little bit it's up to 3.8 now and I
think that rise can be attributed to the
new vanguard release that was just put
out for four players although I'm not
sure if that was out in time for October
but players were certainly training up
and getting ready for it so that is a
factor are caged up two to three point
two percent of the share and that just
shipped in September in North America
and has ascended two spots to round out
the top five now there's also Diablo 3
which we were not big fans of d3 i'm sad
to say because i really wanted to like
it but it just wasn't good in terms of
the story or at launch things have
improved a bit and blizzard just ran a
fifty percent off sale on its expansion
reaper of souls but despite this plate
i'm actually declined almost fifty
percent so they fell from about six
percent playtime to about three percent
of the of the player base in terms of
total time played and in other
interesting news payday 2 jumps in
nearly 20 slots this month or this past
month as a result of Keanu Reeves you
can now play counter
character from John wick in payday 2
which has theoretically gotten some
players but more importantly it's it's
because payday 2 is offering all kinds
of new missions and daily promotions and
did so throughout October so that was a
pretty big reason for its increase
Borderlands the pre-sequel which I am
NOT a big fan of that's pretty common
knowledge is new on the charts and
landed at set point seven seven percent
in place 18 middle-earth shadow of
Mordor a game that our reviews editor
loved is also on the list at number 19
and tf2 very impressive holding strong
at 20th a game that is the really the
oldest one up there next to wow those
two are pretty damn old boast both are
in the decade or approaching a decade
for age dropping out of the list our
path of Exile civ 5 which makes sense
because beyond our is just shipped
Skyrim which makes sense because it's
old but really it's quite impressive
that held on for so long and the sims
for a game that i really can't speak to
so that's our list of the top played pc
games for october as according to rafter
and let us know what you think of this
type of industry related content I can
certainly produce more of it and I will
see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
