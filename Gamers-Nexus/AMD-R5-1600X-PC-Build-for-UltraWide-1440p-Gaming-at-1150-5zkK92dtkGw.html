we're using the r5 1600 X CPU that
received our editors choice award when
it was reviewed this PC is built with
two tasks in mind ultra-wide gaming and
production ready workload at the same
time we wanted to prove that as possible
to game at 34 40 by 1440 without buying
the most expensive parts on the market
and given Ultra wise to complement to
production work the R 5 Series fit the
bill before getting to that this video
is brought to you by the current bundle
on the GTX 1060 and GTX 1080 video cards
where you can get Ghost Recon wildlands
or for honor at checkout this comes
alongside new MSRP is for the GTX 10 80
series cards now down to $500 you can
learn more at the link in the
description below so those were the
goals ultra-wide 1440p with production
readiness but the next set of
requirements was under $1,200 and
everything had to be pulled from our
inventory so I tasked gns team member
Patrick Lathan with this build
he was basically told don't buy anything
he only what we have in stock so this is
what we ended up with now the complete
parts list is in the description below
I'll go over most of them here in the
video we also have had an article online
for a few days if you are curious to see
how that went over but yes we know you
might pick different things the point is
from inventory in-house things we have
tested validated it built with and
suffered with for the last couple months
as we've figured out all the quirks of
Ryze and now it's fairly smooth doubt
with the efi updates and the memory can
more or less figure it out from at least
our perspective so that means we can
piece together things that we know work
and that's really important because of
the new uark it's not necessarily as
easy as plug-and-play all the time there
are a lot of weird quirks that haven't
been fully discovered yet depending on
board and all this other stuff so we
know this one's good that's why we built
it the complete parts list again is
below the result was good overall we're
pretty pleased with it the system came
out to about eleven hundred fifty
dollars after rebates maybe 12 or 1205
if you don't count those and your cost
the core parts include an r5 1600 X we
don't have a 1600 but the 1600 X did
really well on our benchmarks in an
overclocking and all that
so we used it here we've got a gtx 1070
SC which was purposely chosen to fit the
price and show that yes 34 by 14 34 40
by 1440 is in fact playable with
something that's not a 1080 class piece
of hardware so 10 at 70 SC there the
gigabyte X 370 gaming 5 motherboard am 4
board of course is used for our
motherboard of choice you could probably
save 100 you probably go down $250 save
like 50 bucks if you want with something
like a k3 but we just didn't have one in
the house so that fits the board memory
because it's so important to rise and we
are using Corsair Vengeance LTX memory
at 3000 megahertz we looked around a lot
for 32 hundred megahertz kits from what
we have and we've got a lot of them but
it's just not affordable right now and
ultimately we made the judgment call
that we would rather have 200 megahertz
lower memory and save some money than
the other way around because although
the performance gains are reasonable
it's not worth as much as ddr4 cost
today hopefully that changes soon though
and just the costs are brutal but we did
find a couple of combo deals though on
new egg Amazon and elsewhere and there's
all the links below but we can get into
some of the benchmarking now so we've
got tests for power thermals and gaming
for the case we're using a corsair 270
our case this is one that reviewed
positively back when the 570 x launched
the other massive corsair case for its
price the quality and ease of
installation features are great with 270
are and it runs reasonably cool as will
show later we've also got a bit of a
corsair theme here we have an MP 500 SSD
and a cxm 550 watt PSU to accompany the
case for cooling we found as you'll see
in testing later that the stock fan
configuration was enough to keep the
system reasonably cool a thermal take
contact silent 12 air cooler at $25
provided an affordable solution for
direct CPU cooling and again our thermal
tests will show that with the 1070 SCS
cooler handling the rest now because
this is a PC build and not a comparative
benchmark like the CPU and GPU reviews
that means we just built this thin and
then tested it to fit what a real user
would be doing so that means
tuning settings so that 34 or 40 by 1440
is actually
we'll add a reasonable framerate 60-plus
for the most part or even higher in some
cases and that also means that we can
test using different games different
courses and different approaches than we
normally do just because again it's a
one-off build we've done some
overclocking it's really not useful for
gaming because we are so limited by the
pixel throughput required of the GPU
that the CPU overclock is minimal at
best for even overwatch and then in TV
production workloads you can get some
benefit there like in blender and
premiere but we've got benchmarks for
that already if you want to see those
starting with power draw we measure
power draw at the wall and found total
system power draw at idle to be about
sixty eight watts followed by a CPU
accelerated blender crunch workload
demanding 151 Watts really not bad
overall so we can that same blender
heavy render workload to use CUDA with
256 by 256 tile sizes and the 1070
pushed us up to 185 watts at the wall
and overwatch has proven surprisingly
useful for some CPU testing and power
load testing so we threw that in for
gaming workload we were at about 250
eight watts for overwatch given a 550
watt PSU we're around or under 50
percent load marks in most realistic
environments you'd start pushing more
power if running joins CPU and GPU
rendering taneous lee but would still be
able to sustain that on this PSU though
you'd not want to run that 24/7
obviously thermals go hand-in-hand with
power as the two are directly correlated
we tested thermals inside the 270 are
with the system fully built measuring
room ambient second a second to keep
track of external influences on
temperature Emmie's was between 28 and
29 t for the entirety of our thermal
tests rather than run a torture test we
decided to use at real-world scenarios
again to provide a representation of
what you can expect as a user if you
were to build this box idle thermals are
good for both the CPU and GPU operating
that 37 and 39 °c respectively given an
ambience of 2029 relax with a delta in
the 8 to 10 sizes range that's workable
with our blender crunch load at 100% on
the CPU and zero on the GPU let's see
the CPU temperature climbed to about 63
Celsius max which considering our $25
cooler is pretty damn good we'll look at
noise levels in a moment see how they
match this case ambien
which increases as a result of course
and despite the GP undergoing no actual
works during this time for that reason
we see a slight spike in the gpio
temperature though really it's something
more than marginal doubts a 3d mark
combined test executes for our gaming
simulation and makes the workload bump
in GP temperature up to around 76 which
is where it sits before maxing out its
fan curve for the most part and CPU
temperature to around 49 C considering
this is representative of gaming we're
close and both components are under
relatively heavy load
temperatures are completely agreeable
here just as thermals go with power so -
noise goes with thermals we configured
our system to run its fans at 100% at
all times the case fans even the CPU
fans Auto completely idle our system was
running somewhere around 35.4 DBA with
blender workloads not really changing
that the CPU fan speed didn't really
change very much during testing that
said when running a mixed workload
involving the GPU as well the fans spin
up increased noise output by about 4 DBA
not bad overall though fps is where it
gets really interesting
overwatch was the first with max
settings we're seeing a frame rate of 80
FPS average 65 1% low and 59 0.1% low
optimizing overwatch by using our
overwatch graphics optimization guide
that we published recently resulted in
slightly adjusted shadows local fog
detail and reflections down to medium
and a 108 FPS average as a result of
that with spikes to 120 if you really
wanted to you could drop settings a bit
further and get near 120 FPS study any
higher than that will become somewhat
constrained by the CPU even if we were
to throw a GTX 1080 into the mix though
total or warhammer output about 60 FPS
average on ultra or 80 on high
this was also GPU constrained at 34 40
by 1440 so no games there from an
overclocking battle builds one was
around 64 FPS with ultra or 72 on a high
in the campaign but you can expect
roughly a 15% drop in multiplayer
depending on how many actors are nearby
the player zoom on ultra got around 85
FPS average and dirt rally represented
our racing crowd on ultra wide with 80
FPS average at Ultra if you're curious
about blender and premiere results we
have those in the article linked below
now these were also covered very heavily
our our five reviews for more analysis
on that you can check our r5 1600 X
review where we gave the CPU an Editors
Choice Award actually the first editor's
choice for we've given four CPUs this
year so the build overall we're pretty
happy with it performs well it does
gaming at thirty four forty by 1440
pretty handily considering the gtx 1070
which is the biggest choke point for
that resolution and production workloads
are definitely viable on the cpu if you
do software accelerated stuff if you do
could accelerate stuff to ten seventy is
still damn good with premiere if you run
cuda on the ten seventy it will
outperform the r5 1600 x no problem at
all
so that is there as a potential
workhorse for things like premiere or
blender and then if you are using the CP
you've got the 1600 X or of course if
you're doing something like game
streaming which we haven't tested yet
but this should help out in that use
case specifically things to change one
thing to look out for would be potential
memory upgrade so if you can find a 3200
mega kit without a huge increase in
price over this one it's a worthy
consideration once you start spending 20
or 30 dollars it's pushing price kind of
into next CPU territory so be careful at
how much you're spending on memory right
now the motherboard if you wanted to
save 50 bucks the gigabyte k3 is worth
considering especially if you're not
going to be doing any heavy overclocking
and you don't need the extra features on
the gaming 5x 370 board but there is a
bit of a trade in the vrm department so
keep that in mind other than that the
build holds up well performance is good
thermals are really not bad you could
add an extra fan to the top it's got one
in the middle right now but adding one
to the top would increase your air flow
through the CPU area and reduce those
temperatures it's just it's really not
necessary it does pretty well without it
so that helps keep the noise levels down
as well and that's it complete parts
