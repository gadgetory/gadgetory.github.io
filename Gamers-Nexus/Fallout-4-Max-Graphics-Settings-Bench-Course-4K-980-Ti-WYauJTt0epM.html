net and what you're looking at is our
benchmark course for Fallout 4 you can
find the full benchmark with all of the
FPS results and video cards linked on
the website or in the description below
at gamers Nexus net and we'll upload a
video for that as well if it's not
already online this course was designed
specifically to produce a mixed workload
for the GPU when testing a fallout 4
this was a GPU limited workload so we
had a 59 30k CPU in the system which
means that that was not a bottleneck at
all and this means that we can see the
stress level produced by fallout 4s
graphic settings on GPUs the course
selected is in diamond city and the
beginning of the course tanks FPS pretty
hard as you can see it's the most
stressful when you're looking the camera
straight at the center of the sort of
downtown area I suppose where there's
some AI and a lot of models and things
like that and then as we walk around the
course the frame rate jumps up quite a
bit sometimes in excess of thirty
percent or higher gains over the
starting area of our benchmark we loop
back around and walk backwards and look
at the original area again this produces
our mixed workload to create sort of a
realistic environment now that said
running around in different parts of the
game will produce different load levels
so in some fields you'll have really
high FPS maybe 2x what you get in this
city and other cities it might tank
pretty hard in really specific instances
but overall fallout 4 is not an
intensive game this is the maximum
graphics setting you're looking at here
this is a holder is to it so as you can
see it's not particularly impressive
visually but then again but as the never
is so that's all for the bench course
check the website and the channel for
more of the benchmark itself another
fallout 4 information the graphic
settings will be defined in a separate
video so that's all for this time hit
the patreon link in the postal video if
you like this type of content and want
to support us and I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
