it's not necessarily a bad thing in this
instance the way the new rise in CPU
scale is behaviorally similar to the way
GPU boost 4.0 scales on GPUs we're
simply lowering the silicon operating
temperature will directly affect
performance and clock speeds under
complete full stock settings a CPU
running colder will actually boost
higher now alternatively if you're a
glass half-empty type you could view it
as the CPU running hotter causing
thermal throttling either way frequency
is contingent upon thermals and that's
important for users who want to maximize
performance or pick the right case and
CPU cooling combination if you're new to
the space the way it has traditionally
worked is just CPUs will run at one spec
with one set of frequencies until
hitting t.j.maxx or maximum Junction
temperature rise in 3000 is
significantly different from past CPUs
in this regard and we're going to
explore this today with some additional
work that we did from our livestream
where we overclocked the 3900 acts
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the gamers Nexus toolkit on
store cameras axis net our brand new
toolkit just launched and contains 10
custom eight drivers for video card
disassembly reap hasting and tear downs
the eight core tools are made of
high-quality chromium vanadium alloy
steel that's built for long service life
and resistance to wear during use the
other two tools are carbon steel hex
heads that were custom ground down for
capacitor clearance on video cards all
the tools are easily mounted to a
pegboard or stored in the GN made tool
bag for easy transport
learn more at the link in the
description below an Intel CPU is
probably the easiest foil to rise in
3000 series CPUs with Intel you have
really only two parameters to consider
there's the turbo boost duration which
we have a whole separate content piece
on including MCE discussion and then
there's the power limitations and beyond
that thermal is only a factor once you
get up to t.j.maxx for the most part so
the way this works is if operating
within spec outside of the turbo
duration limit which is 90 to 120
seconds on average depending on what the
motherboard vendor has done on there and
the CPU will stick to one all core speed
for the entirety of its workload and
there's no modulation within that speed
so you could be running the Intel CPU at
40 degrees you could be running it at 90
degrees and as long as you're not at
t.j.maxx you'll get one
frequency out of it whatever they define
for the most part in their in their
turbo boosting tables it'll be the same
frequency so once you hit t.j.maxx say
it's maybe 95 or a hundred degrees
Celsius you either get thermal
throttling on the multiplier to get
multiplier throttling or you get a
thermal shutdown and the choice between
a two will very depend on which
motherboard you've chosen for your
platform AMD Rison by contrast behaves
more like modern GPUs the positive way
to look at this is pretty simple
out-of-the-box the companies are now
maximizing performance to the best of
their thermal power and current
conditions with granular steps in
frequency along the Volt frequency curve
this is also using thermal as a gauge
for where on the curve the silicon
should operate given the current
condition this means that there's less
overclocking Headroom it means that as a
testing environment it's a lot harder to
get like-for-like benchmarks because the
companies no longer have to tune for a
worst-case scenario but that also means
that the out of box performance is
nearing the maximum reasonable
performance achievable by manual
overclocking so primarily this is mostly
a good thing because just like with GPU
boost the horizon CPUs are boosting to
their maximum thermal capabilities as
opposed to the alternative which would
be AMD setting a lower boost frequency
to account for the worst-case scenarios
and then giving the user more
overclocking Headroom so you get one or
the other but ultimately the out of box
performance does matter quite a bit
because most people don't overclock
factually that is that is the way it is
so that's the way to look at it the best
way to demonstrate how frequency scales
with thermal which is what we're doing
today we just have one chart it's very
simple is to simply run a few tests
we're using the gigabyte x5 Sony master
motherboard for this and we're running a
CPU stock so it's the rise in line 3900
X it's a 12 core CPU keep in mind that
as you increase frequency across all
cores it has significantly more impact
than if you increase frequency across
one core so if you run a CPU with let's
say frequency that's maybe 150 mega
Hertz higher all core in blender versus
150 mega Hertz lower option the
difference will emerge there more you'll
have a more of a percent change than you
will if you're running a more
single-threaded workload like a game or
like Cinebench one threaded something
like that where it's it's just an
increase on a single-core further what
we are doing running stock is allowing
precision boost to to do its thing we
have a separate video with excruciating
detail on what precision boost means and
how it's different from precision boost
overdrive or PBO you may have seen those
letters lately and also how it's
different from auto se which is not part
of the president boost feature set or
the precision boost overdrive feature
set it's in the same menu but it's a
different thing so to be extremely clear
here
precision boost overdrive or PBO is
explicitly different from precision
boost - and the reason we're pointing
that out is because we're using just
stock full stock settings zero changes
all we've done is run the CPU more or
less out of the box and we're gonna go
from there so there's no PBO enabled
here it's just the native precision
boost - which is considered stock and if
you're uncertain about any of this all
this is also in the AMD review guide
where they say to disable PBO for stock
operation so hopefully that's fairly
clear all PBO does is bypass current
limits so it bypasses ppt it bypasses
TDC and it bypasses EDC and all of those
are in the separate video if you don't
know what those are so all that said
we're controlling temperatures within a
range of about 84 degrees Celsius T die
or the die temperature of the CPU and
down to minus 80 degrees for the 40 pot
for the Alan to pilot temperature and
this is also there's no mortise ETL so
we don't have to worry about that here
it's just straight T die until we get
sub 0 and then the reading bugs out and
we have to go from a thermocouple that
we've attached separately so let's get
into it the chart coming up will show
frequency and Cinebench score versus
temperature it's a very straightforward
test we're going to be manually tuning
the TDI temperature on the cpu for each
test pass so the cooling solution here
is 100% irrelevant it doesn't matter
what we use to cool it as long as we
control the temperature the CPU doesn't
know what's on top of it it doesn't know
if there's a liquid cooler or an air
cooler we're now onto pot all it knows
is the temperature it's operating that
so this allows us to see the range of
performance under various cooling
conditions it'll allow us to demonstrate
the actual real-world impact of good
case and cooler combinations on your C
you and we'll start with more of a
real-world warm scenario then go to not
real world - sub-zero and just see if
the scaling continues the chart starts
at about 84 degrees Celsius which is
where you might be sitting with the 3900
X and a stock cooler with the average
modern case in a room that is lightly
air-conditioned at 84 degrees we
measured frequency between 3975
megahertz and 4000 megahertz sticking
closer on average to let's call it 39 75
maybe 3980 once he averaged it out on
the 12 core CPU as we manually dialed
our temperature to reach 78 degrees we
averaged 40 50 megahertz all core
frequency and 71 degrees Celsius for TDI
put us around 40 75 mega Hertz all core
for reference with a step down to 61
degrees a 10 degree drop
improving all core frequency notably to
41 50 megahertz and remember this is
just in a bench here but the the scaling
should continue and pretty much any
application based on thermal the next
step is 255 degrees where we saw an
improvement 240 200 megahertz with a bit
of averaging in there becomes more of
maybe 40 190 or so 40 185 about 4200
megahertz
after multiple runs up that sustained
temperature this is not delta T over
ambient as the only important thing here
is the actual operating temperature
ambient for what it's worth was 21
degrees but we're showing CP temperature
anyways that's not relevant at the
moment what is relevant is that an
ambient temperature of 21 to 25 degrees
might be common for an air-conditioned
house depending on where you live and
how you like to keep it cooled and
adjust as needed if if you do keep it
warmer case ambient is often approaching
a range of 30 degrees even on a good
case and a 21 degree celsius environment
with our test systems we used for case
reviews so a 55 degree low temperature
is achievable primarily with high-end
cooling solutions and well ventilated
cases it's doable you can actually
achieve this if you try but this is the
end of our common real-world scenarios
where as the 78 to 84 range would
represent a stock cooler load condition
with a decent case we can go further we
can go lower than that and see what it
looks like later so down to 36 degrees
we see scaling continue to 40 to 25
megahertz again this is across all cores
and at 18 degrees we average roughly 40
to 60 with individual cores bouncing
around a bit more than we saw previously
event
we stopped scaling at minus 80 degrees
Allen to pot temperatures are a teapot
so the CPU is somewhere between 0 and
minus 80 we don't know exactly where
because we've lost the sensors at this
point so the all core frequency at minus
AE teapot is 40 300 megahertz all core
fixed never change him that's really
good so cold bugs were encountered after
this we hit them about minus 81 to minus
85 as for CB marks those scale
relatively linearly with frequency the
range from 84 degrees TDI to 55 degrees
TDI which are the max and men of the
reasonable temperatures a user might
encounter from not spending a lot on
cooling to being try hard on cooling
that range is about four percent
performance increase just from a lower
CPU temperature on the CPU zero changes
we're not overclocking this is not PBO
this is stock the same thing would
happen if you did this on a GPU like an
NVIDIA GPU so this is why cooler and
case selection matter a lot with Rison
and why we as a review outlet have to be
careful to maintain a fixed cooling
condition for testing in a fixed
environment we run AC at the same
temperature the whole time for all of
our CPU tests and and all that impacts
the frequency of the scores so the
maximum scale not that it's particularly
relevant to users is about 6.4 percent
from 31 20 points to 33 19 points
scaling from minus 80 to 84 degrees
positive over zero Celsius we're
basically at GPU boost behavior on the
CPU at this point in this regard we can
use liquid nitrogen as a really neat
utility for carefully controlling the
temperature rather than dumping L onto
into the pot we can run fairly dry and
set temperatures to whatever value we
want them to be manual application of
allen tool allows us to keep fairly
consistent temperatures with a range of
roughly plus or minus 2 degrees celsius
from the test begin to test and the
segments a lot of people will probably
overlook the fact that while l n2 is
indeed cold the cpu is only as cold as
we allow it to run with minimal allen to
use and just a cold allen to pot we can
get the cpu to run at 84 degrees which
is really hot for Allen to as a solution
but obviously it depends on what you
modulate it and we can operate under the
same thermal conditions as a stock
cooler in a warm case so this allows us
to test with greater granularity and
accuracy
as we can dial the temperature to
whatever we want rather than being
limited by coolers available and having
to swap them out all the time so from
here you can extrapolate the thermal
data to know how hard you want to
brute-force your cooling but colder is
definitely better with Ryze and there's
obviously a point of diminishing returns
but you really can't go too crazy with
cooling for this chip we saw scaling all
the way to Sub Zero which you're you're
not gonna get that I mean most people
are not running chillers maybe a pipe
and some air from outside in the winter
or something but on average most people
are obviously running at or above
ambient in the best case is maybe at
with a low workload or something so yeah
point is if if you're you've got some
money and the only thing holding you
back between buying some crazy
tricked-out cooling solution and going
to step down is you're not sure if it's
worth it it as long as the cooling
solution has a difference in temperature
in thermal performance it will produce a
difference it'll it'll create a
different result is it worth it well
obviously that starts coming down to the
money argument and that's gonna depend
on how much money you have to spend on
your computer a lot of the time you
could take the extra 50 bucks that you
might spend on one class better cooler
and sink it into a GPU upgrade and going
from well going from like a this is
low-end but 5757 rxc that's $50 that
performance gap will be bigger than the
performance increases heat from better
cooling but if you if you don't really
have much of a budget better cooling
solutions certainly aren't going to hurt
it's not like Intel CPUs where once you
once you kind of have it controlled
there's no benefit to going better other
than reducing power leakage and for
reducing power leakage you get about a
4% reduction in power consumption by the
chip for every 10 degrees Celsius or so
that you drop the core temperature but
is that a value well not really
so anyway pretty cool stuff
literally in some cases what we need to
do next is obviously look at thermal
solutions individually and subscribe to
make sure you can catch that content
this was filmed and I edited this one so
our editors didn't get involved they've
got another break
and I will be flying to California for
an EVGA charity livestream where I'm
battling with Jay Jay's two cents with
kingpin as the referee for an Ellen to
overclocking thing so if you want to
catch that check on Tuesday we're gonna
try and stream that otherwise it'll be
on their channel as well so yeah point
is we'll look at more thermal solutions
once back but really interesting data
how useful is it well you see a scaling
of about four ish percent under
reasonable conditions so it does that
matter that'll depend on you but we
wanted to present it and show that Rison
actually really cares so when we go on
rants for 20 minutes about how much a
case is terrible at cooling this is the
situation where it's going to matter a
lot it also means that we can't really
use the rise and chips easily in a case
test bench because the frequency will
scale so you have to start plotting
frequency plots in addition to the
temperature plots and the temperature
plots aren't exactly accurate because
your frequency is changing so it's no
longer like for like so anyway yeah pick
a good case make it cooler if you can
afford it and don't feel too bad if you
can't you still get reasonable
performance it's just that obviously
it's a bit better with colder so that's
it for this one thank you for watching
subscribe for more you can go to store
documents nexus dotnet to helps out
directly like by picking up one of these
toolkits that we have or by picking up
one of our mod mats or shirts if you
