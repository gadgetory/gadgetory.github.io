recap for this week the major news item
the anchor is that NVIDIA bought too
many GPUs that's been a bit of a problem
for them also GPU shipments trending
downward as well as potentially profits
Samsung hynix and micron the memory
suppliers are facing potential antitrust
fines ranging from anywhere from eight
hundred million dollars to eight billion
dollars a bit of a range there and then
also Intel CEO resigned so it's been a
week filled with drama in the hardware
world before that this video is brought
to you by Corsairs HS 70 wireless gaming
headset which focuses on comfort with
memory foam adjustable ear cups and a
padded headband the headset has a 40
foot low latency range over wireless
lasts for up to 16 hours of gaming use
and as extra focus on build quality to
ensure it lasts a long time
learn more at the link in the
description below for the first news
item nvidia buying too many GPUs this
was this has been posted by one or two
news outlets at this point and it's
something that we spoke with people
about during the Computex timeline so
we've been able to confirm basically the
stories that Nvidia allegedly purchased
too many GPUs in anticipation of mining
to some extent for the Pascal
architecture and at this point it's
looking like they're delaying their
launch of taurine as a result of having
too many Pascal GPUs so if you're
wondering why GE prices have been
trending downward a bit and why some of
the AIB partners have suddenly found
budget to run ads for video cards when
they haven't needed to for months
that's probably why and from what we
understand we're still on target for a
next generation architecture launch
probably in August it's just a question
of why was it pushed to August and from
everything we've seen from the people
we've spoken with and from the other
news stories online it does sound like
Nvidia in fact bought too many Pascal
GPUs and they're stuck with overstock
this goes back to what we talked about
when we spoke with manufacturing
partners off the record previously about
why they would or would not get invested
in mining and the reason why not for
of them was because they didn't want to
be stuck in this situation where they
have too many GPUs we've also heard that
one of the board partners has requested
to return some of their excess GPUs to
Nvidia not sure if that'll go through
but that does indicate that they
definitely bots humanity next 1gb of
shipments and profits trending downward
prices could still remain high here so
in another digit times report AIB
partners are expected to see their
shipments fall in the second half of
2018
due to a reduction in cryptocurrency
mining demand as shipments and profits
shift downward due to the demand
shrinkage prices are still anticipated
to remain somewhat high they've been a
couple of cards in some market segments
that have finally been brought down 1070
t is a bit of more affordable now for
example but a couple of the other cards
like Vega do remain far over MSRP in a
lot of situations comedies such as ACS
gigabyte MSI and power color told their
parent company are all expected to see
inflated inventories as they abandon the
mining market as prices continue to
normalize somewhat vendors are still
maintaining their overall higher or
should say the retailers are maintaining
their overall higher prices of about 20
percent inflated over MSRP but this is
much lower than the 40 to 50 percent
inflation over MSRP that we've seen
previously but still higher than the
normal 8 to 10% kind of max that we saw
before the mining boom
according to digit times industry
sources indicate that DRAM suppliers
Samsung SK Hynix and micron could be
facing antitrust fines up to eight
billion dollars in China for price
fixing the three companies collectively
controlled 90% of the DRAM market and
the memory prices have been rising
almost exponentially since 2017 early on
at this point and something that we've
also covered many times now is that this
is almost cyclic where if you plot it
over the last five years you'll see the
prices rise and fall in basically
perfect unison with the stock prices of
these companies Samsung notwithstanding
because it makes so many things so
samsung hynix and micron have all
confirmed that China's antitrust
regulators have visited their offices
and had conversations
with them as part of an ongoing
investigation into potential
price-fixing nothing's been publicly
confirmed yet if found guilty of this
the vendors could face fines ranging
from 800 million up to eight billion
dollars the estimated fines are based on
profits in China between 2016 and 2017
as we've previously mentioned China has
no small interest in memory related
things they've become the world's
largest consumer of DRAM and the Chinese
government is currently working on
becoming more self-sufficient in its own
memory supply for the future
next one Intel CEO has resigned so
Intel's announced that Brian krzanich
has resigned amidst discovering a quote
past consensual relationship with
another Intel employee which violates
Intel's of non-fraternization policy for
management Intel has appointed CFO Bob
Swann as the interim CEO while they
conduct a search for a permanent
replacement so if you're looking for a
job that pays about 21 million dollars a
year they're hiring Chris an was tasked
with several restructuring initiatives
during his tenure as CEO and the most
notable was being Intel's transition to
a data centric business and evolving
past the PC segment exclusively Chris
anich was a decades-old employee
starting with Intel in 1982 and the
timing is a bit suspect as the alleged
relationship wasn't a new occurrence or
news in general it's just something that
they finally decided to dig into now and
difficulty launching 10 nanometers could
we be jaded among us to assume ulterior
motives next up AMD is 7 nanometer
Radeon Pro Vega 20 asses of the
singularity benchmarks were apparently
leaked and these benchmarks point to a
suspected at workstation grade GPU based
on a seven nanometer Vega 20 note first
however that there have been several
fake leaks or faked benchmarks lately in
the form of modified Cinebench or other
benchmark files so we'd recommend
scrutinizing the Vega 20 leaks a little
more than normally Vega 20 is expected
to hit the server and data center market
with little word on when or if other
markets can expect and these seven
nanometer Vega 20 silicon and he has
clearly stated that they will bring
seven nanometer silicon to the gaming
eventually but it's been widely
speculated that it will come in the form
of Navi rather than Vega early Vega 20
specs claim 4096 stream processors
support for up to 32 gigabytes of HP m2
allegedly twice the density and power
efficiency overall and a 35 percent
performance increase compared to 14
nanometer Vega also in AMD news and the
assume what quietly launched the pro-v
340 rumors have surfaced online
speculating as to whether this card was
a vague attend or Vega 2020 being based
on 7 nanometers and it's almost
certainly not 7 nanometers as bandi
would have made a much larger
announcement out of this additionally
the pro-v 340 is supposedly a multi chip
or multi-gpu solution comprised of two
Vega 10 dies with a total of 32
gigabytes of HB m2 presumably split
between the two GPUs and giving you 16
gigabytes per Vega GPU Vega 20 allegedly
supports up to 32 gigabytes for a single
solution single die and the pro-v 340 is
aimed at virtualization for professional
use such as oil and gas research
designers media and entertainment things
like that next one is AMD appealing to
the cheap seats by sort of trolling
Intel and Intel recently held a
sweepstakes celebrating the 40th
anniversary of their venerable 8086
processor and the launch of the limited
edition i7 8086 K and II took this
opportunity to troll Intel by offering
the winners of Intel sweepstakes a
chance to trade in their i7 8086 K that
they just won for one of AMD's thread
Ripper 1950 xcp use completely different
target markets it certainly gets
interest and attention in the community
but it is definitely appealing to the
cheap seats on that one Intel quickly
responded by the way via their own
official Intel gaming Twitter page and
said at AMD Rison if you wanted an Intel
Core i7 8086 K processor - you could
have just asked us the smiley face
thanks for helping us celebrate the 8086
overall a good spirited exchange between
the two companies of a bit odd and
unexpected
next up Intel hires former Larrabee
architects so this story gets a little
confusing
for anyone who's been covering Raja
Kaduri as he was at AMD because Intel
hired Raja Kaduri
a while ago now and Kaduri also just
hired Intel's former Larrabee GPU
architects Tom forces to aid in the
development of the company's new GPUs
Forsyth's previously made advancements
to AVX instructions processing
particularly avx-512 and has been
speculated as a potential player for VR
development focus at Intel for the next
generation Intel GPU Forsyth noted on
Twitter that he will quote started Intel
shortly as a chip architect in Raja
kaduri's group more AMD news on this one
and he's working with Coolermaster on
their wraith ripper cooler this is
something that was shown at Computex
that we didn't cover it at the show we
were focus on the cases and the
announced threader for two at Computex
in an official capacity and our
understanding presently is that it's
looking like 250 watts to upwards of
potentially 300 Watts TDP for threader
for two motherboard vendors are working
on the x3 99 refresh to ensure they can
take this amount of power and heat look
at the MSI X 399 creation for example
but cooling vendors have to get involved
too
and one of those is Coolermaster we're
working on new tr4 coolers so AMD's
collaborating with coolermaster for the
wraith ripper mega cooler they're
calling it a massive air cooler capable
of dissipating 250 watts of heat as
measured by andy's version of TDP they
all do it a bit differently the cooler
will use eight pairs of heat pipes
attached to a large stack of pretty
densely packed fins and wraith Ripper
will purportedly guarantee memory module
clearance because it's going to have
several slots on either side of the
socket so that's a consideration and it
will also be adorned with addressable
RGB LEDs because that's innovation a
center mounted concealed 120 millimeter
fan will handle the airflow Wraith river
will be sold through Coolermaster and
either coolermaster nor AMD have
revealed pricing or availability details
on that cooler just yet last one is
about be quiet it's not the most
exciting thing they've opened a us-based
service center so German BAE has to be
quiet has announced the opening of their
first us-based service center and
declared a commitment to our us-based
customers and be quiet also noted that
this service center will be based in Los
Angeles and will be aimed at both
consumer and business customers if you
didn't know be quiet has had issues in
the past selling their products in the
u.s. because Newegg is not the easiest
retailer to work with so they had to
actually bypass new item list on their
own on the third-party marketplace
originally before new I was willing to
work with them so they've had a bit of
trouble getting into the US but they're
trying harder now finally hardware sales
for the week EVGA has got their gtx 1070
TI at 490 dollars with an included
supernova 550 watt g3 power supply and
we'll put a link to that in the
description below there are also several
other video cards that are on sale which
is basically MSRP at this point but it's
been a while so we'll link to one or two
of those below it as well once the video
goes live we'll have more updates on
that and finally Corsairs @ TX 650 M is
on sale for $50 after rebate normally 90
on new AG which we'll link below as well
so that's it for this time is always
good a store doc gamers Nexus dotnet to
pick up one of our mod mats one of the
GN teardown cubes that we gave to
vendors as Awards during the show if you
want your own or go to
patreon.com/scishow and nexus to helps
out directly
subscribe for more i'll see you all next
