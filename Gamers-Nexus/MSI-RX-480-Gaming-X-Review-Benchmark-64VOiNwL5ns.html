reviews of reference cards we
recommended waiting on the our X 480
until partner models came out from
adding board partners like amasai Asus
and other folks working on card sapphire
so forth and so that's finally come to
be we have an MSI twin Fraser 6 cooled
version of the rx 480 and it is called
the gaming X so it's the same naming
scheme as followed for the gtx 960 1070
so forth and the our X 480 reference
card when we reviewed it was before the
10-6 came out and so at that time we
recommended the 480 as the new go to 200
to $300 card and as a 1060 came out of
course there's a lot more competition so
now it's a split market between the two
and you can check our 1060 review for
more discussion on the explicit
comparison between the 480 and 1060 but
for today we're reviewing the MSI R X
480 gaming X and this one is equipped
with that Twin Frozr cooler so it's a
bit more advanced in terms of cooling
potential it's got a pre overclock
applied to it as priced at 265 dollars
versus the $250 price of the reference
card in this review we'll look at the
MSI pre overclocked 480 for thermal
frame rate and overclocking performance
this is the specs listing of that 480
from MSI the price for the card is $15
more than reference it's still the 8
gigabyte model and the card runs 8
gigabytes of vram clocked at 8 gigabits
per second or an actual memory speed of
2000 megahertz and the rest of the specs
as you might expect are the same as the
reference card the architecture
obviously hasn't changed so we're really
just looking at a pre overclock and
that's about it check out the RX for ad
initial review for information on
architecture the cooler is where these
AIB partners really differentiate
themselves in design from each other and
from the reference card and this cooler
is the Twin Frozr 6 cooler so it's going
to be the same that we detailed at
Computex this year and also and pretty
much every card review since then from
MSI it's got dual push fans as you can
see they are pretty large fans and that
is possible because the PCB is a custom
PCB you can see this one is actually a
good deal larger than the reference
model and so it's not
i taller but also wider the height
allows msi to fit the dual push fans
that are pretty large on there which is
really a benefit to noise so now as i
can spin them at lower rpms they're
larger they just pay more heat per
rotation so to speak and that allows a
slower fan speed and also better idles
because you can leave the fans idle when
it's under 60 Celsius load and so that's
just a noise consideration the PCB is
also wider and that's similar it allows
this huge aluminum heatsink to be
accommodated and then there are three
copper heat pipes which are
nickel-plated for the rest of the card
and those are two six millimeter pipes
and one eight millimeter pipe here the
cards heat pipes square out towards the
cold plate which helps ensure contact
between heat pipes and the aluminum fins
that spread the heat greater surface
area overall has been the primary push
for this generation of AIB partner
coolers on both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and
the cooler is two six millimeter and one
eight millimeter heat pipe are rounded
on the outside but they do square out
towards the middle a base plate sits
under the cooler making contact to the
FETs and helping with vrm dissipation
but also providing structural support in
conjunction with the flanking backplate
and you can actually if you look on the
side see some of the chokes sticking up
from that base plate let's get to some
testing the bench you're looking at on
the screen now is our test platform and
our full testing methodology is defined
in great depth on the website as always
you can hit that below if you want to
read more you can also search the
channel for one-percent lows or for
Delta T if you want to learn more about
what either of these measurements for
FPS and temperature mean the peak
average temperature of the msi are X 480
gaming X using MSI's updated Twin Frozr
six cooler post a load output of 46.1
six Celsius with an idle of 7.5 for
Celsius and that's sustained entirely
with passive cooling when doing idle
most ABI partners including EVGA ACX
gigabyte msi and most of the others at
this point we'll spin down to zero rpm
when under minimal load that's resorting
to passive heatsink cooling this is
versus the reference cooler for the AR X
480 the MSI rx 40 gaming X posts about
10 degrees Celsius cooler performance
overall versus the rx 40 reference from
Andy and that performance improvement is
in line with our previous tests of AIB
partner coolers versus the reference
designs here's the overtime chart this
shows temperature versus time so it's
the same data as the previous chart but
presented differently for full over time
charts fan RPMs things like that check
the link in the description below as for
our endurance tests we saw nearly
perfectly flat frequency output and
that's what we want to see the frequency
is able to maintain its defined setting
by MSI that pre overclocked with greater
stability then even the reference card
was able to maintain a lower clock rate
and that's because of the improved
thermal solution compared to the
endurance of the our X 480 reference
card the MSI gaming X rendition of the
product is greatly improved in clock
rate stability and in temperatures and
as always for more thermal analysis
check the link of the description below
before getting into FPS for this card a
quick important note we posted a video
about 16.7 dot 3 the new AMD updates to
its Radeon settings and driver package
for the rx 480 and other cards and we
were having a lot of issues with that
driver set when we were actually tasking
this card which of course whittier rolls
out slightly addressed so things may
change by the time you see the video but
the relevant point here is that we
didn't use 16.7 dot 3 for benchmarking
because it was just not stable for what
we were doing with the RX 480 and so we
ended up just using the same driver
packages we've been using for the last
few reviews which will be updated as
soon as something stable comes out so
we're on 16 72 which is equivalent to 16
to 7 1 except there was a internal
version 16.7 dot 2 for GTA 5 and for
doom which supports the Vulcan update
and are on the original launch drivers
which I believe were 16.6 dot 2 for
every other game on the bench and as
always will update once the drivers are
updated properly let's start with GTA 5
at 1080p the msi RX for you gaming XP
overclocked to 1303 megahertz manage the
frame rate of 88 FPS average with 1%
lows at 63 and 0.1% low is not far
behind looking at the reference our X
480 clocked at 12 66 megahertz a boost
we see an 80 5.3 FPS average so not a
huge gain
but it does at least post a difference
of 3.1 percent for reference the
reference gtx 1060 rest set around 95
FPS average with 67 FPS 1% lows and
that's a difference of 7.6 percent from
the msi RX 4 80
we haven't fully tested our suite at
1440p with GTA 5 but just as a quick
note here we were heading 64 FPS average
45 FPS 1% low and 39 0.1% Louis with the
msi version of the RX for 80 lakh ops 3
tends to show more favorable performance
on AMD hardware which makes it an
interesting benchmark title the game is
also exceptionally well optimized for
its graphics quality and routinely
exceeds 100 FPS at 1080p at high at
1080p again hide the msi our X 480 hits
144 FPS average with a 117 fps 1% low
and 111 FPS 0.1% low and that's a good
gain over the reference our X 480 which
is at 132 FPS average so 132 Brits 144
equating a difference of 8.5% by ops 3
is a fairly clock intensive game which
is evident here and in this instance the
AIB partner cards are enough of a jump
with the pre OC that it differentiates
between 144 Hertz gaming and just under
that for reference the gtx 1060 founders
Edition card runs at 122 FPS average at
1080p at 1440p the msi our X 480
maintains a 91 FPS average still fully
playable with lows exceeding 60 FPS and
the reference card sits at around 83 FPS
average so a bit more than 7 FPS
difference between the 2 our 4 gigabyte
unit had some 0.1% low frame time issues
with black ops 3 at 1440p but was still
at 88 FPS average for reference again
the gtx 1060 founder's Edition is at 78
FPS average and that's just above the
GTX 970 SSC or superclocked or as they
might call it super super clocked
version of the card for the curious the
msi our X 480 was bumping 45 FPS average
at 4k high so you'd want to be at 1440p
or lower resolution for optimal player
you'd have to seriously tank your
settings because in black ops 3 with
this setup because the Z
point one percent losers were suboptimal
the RX for 80 even from MSI was choppy
and black ops 3 up next doom note that
we're hoping to conduct more doom tests
in the future with Vulcan and async
compute and that will be in the near
future but we're backlogged on GP
reviews right now in the meantime we're
looking at doom with OpenGL and Vulcan
to quickly test API scalability within
the game
at 1080p the MSI R X 480 performs a
couple FPS better than the reference
card as doom is less clock rate
intensive than some of our other titles
we've tested and the gaming X 480 is at
87 FPS which is 85 of the reference card
lows are comparable the GTX 1060 is the
one to keep an eye on here by the way is
at ninety eight point three FPS average
with OpenGL marking a reasonable lead
over the RX 480
let's switch though to the chart with a
Vulcan and OpenGL simultaneously with
Vulcan this story sort of changes the
our X 480 now operates at 111 FPS
average with the MSI version of the card
at 118 dot 5 FPS average the GTX 1060 F
II posts nearly identical performance to
its OpenGL output at 97.9 fps and is now
behind the RX 4 80s in performance so
they've traded 1440p is a similar story
looking at our OpenGL only chart we see
the MSI rx 480 is a couple FPS faster
than the reference card posting about a
5% difference both cards are behind the
1060 EFI is 66 FPS average and higher lo
metrics in this chart but looking at
Vulcan and OpenGL the MSI are X 480
gaming axis and now at nearly 80 fps
with the reference card at almost 74 FPS
average the GTX 1060 gaming X from MSI
is at almost 70 FPS these new API s are
still finding their way into games and
still working on optimization so there's
a bit of difference between how they
perform right now but it'll be
interesting to observe performance as
game developers to start making the
switch over from the last gen AP is to
support next gen only built moving on to
Mirror's Edge catalyst 1080p ultra has
the MSI R X 480 gaming X operating at
seventy eight point seven FPS average
with poorly time 0.1% lows at thirty
five point seven fps and this has the
card performance similarly to the EVGA
GTX 970
SSC but with significantly worse low
frame times and that is detectable to
the player for reference the stock our X
480 from AMD runs a few FPS slower at 74
FPS average and the GTX 1060 EFI is a
bit faster 82 FPS average at 1440p ultra
the msi rx 40 gaming X sits at 51 fps
closer now to the GTX 1060 f:e but the
EFI card again sustains better low frame
rates we tested plenty more games as
well so if you want to see ashes of the
singularity for DX 12 and 11 comparisons
or Metro last light just for some really
stable benchmark game the division and
Mordor those are all linked in the
description below on the full review of
the card alright so let's talk about
overclock has one of the more
interesting points of an AAV Partner
card the overclocking process is the
same on this card as with the our X 480
reference we're using an these Whatman
utility built into the drivers and
afterburner will eventually come out but
it's not ready yet for the RX 480 so we
didn't use it for this test so we're
using a wot man and with wot man based
on the stepping chart you can see on the
screen now we eventually settled on a 13
16 megahertz overclock on the core and
2150 on the memory we pushed 2200 but it
was just a little too volatile we saw
some flickering on occasion didn't do a
hard crash but it did flicker and that's
not stable and when we pushed the 13 70
megahertz same thing it would hard crash
or would flicker so we settled 13 60 and
2150 note here that the MSI our X 480
can push to 1168 millivolts while the
reference card can only do 11 50s that
is also useful for stability we measured
the maximum GPU draw at 240 Watts when
fully overclocked and that's not the
card draw that's the GPU draw so with
the card you add a bit extra for the
memory and things like that 40 or 50
watts more depending on power target
memory overclock and all that stuff
results are what you see on the screen
now in terms of the actual FPS
performance you can see we gain a couple
of frames in some cases for the most
part we're just between where we were
hitting with the RX for a dihybrid which
we were able to push 13 90 megahertz you
can see that in shadow of mordor and
the overclocked reference card which we
got stuck at 13 40 megahertz so the msi
RX 4 80
this card is able to push an additional
20 megahertz or so on the core with this
particular card that we have does
obviously very somewhat card to card so
we get an extra 20 megahertz not a huge
deal but overall you're paying more for
things like the cooler that's where your
extra 15 dollars is going for the most
part so with these over clocks and
important thing to note is that the
extra OC we get the extra 20 megahertz
or so is not accompanied by a screaming
loud blower fan and get on this thing
this we have to keep it around 4,000 rpm
the fan is pretty loud of that speed and
that was just to keep it cool enough to
perform a 13 40 megahertz core clock OC
this doesn't have that issue runs out
about 30 to 40% fan speed they're bigger
fans they spin slower in general so
they're much quieter so that is the main
trade off here
in addition to the extra 20 megahertz in
terms of the conclusion here the change
between the reference card and this
board partner card is not huge in most
games with FPS but in a couple games
like more clock sensitive like black ops
3 you do see a pretty reasonable
difference in fact it's enough to go
from 130 ish FPS on this 244 on this
which if you're 144 Hertz monitor owner
you're playing competitive FPS that's a
decent enough change where you would
certainly want in a heavy partner card
if you didn't already and by the way we
really don't recommend these you don't
recommend the founders edition cards
either it's just the board partners do a
better job with cooling and that impacts
more than cooling as you've seen here at
impacts the frequency stability as well
and you also get some pre Oasys applied
if you're not going to overclock on your
own so in general this was never really
the core recommendation even though we
said the RX 480 is the new sort of 200
to $300 titleholder as stated in that
video we're indicating more for the
partner models now here's the thing this
is $265 so at 265 you're encroaching on
territory of a lot of the gtx 1060
market and that's a pretty powerful
performer as well they are very tightly
tie
in some games the 1060 tends to
outperform the RX 480 and a good deal of
games rx 40 times outperform the 1060
and a good deal of games it just depends
on what you're looking at for an example
with black ops and doom doom on Vulcan
not OpenGL we see the 480 times I'll
perform the 1060 with other games GT a
shadow of mordor we see the opposite
1060 outperforms the 480 so if you're
playing one game very heavily I would
suggest that you look for benchmarks of
that specific game we might have them
linked below and pick the card that
looks the best for that game if you're
playing kind of a wide berth of games
then just look through all of our charts
figure out what kind of looks like it
matches the most of what you're playing
and and pick from there in terms of the
overall performance though certainly
this would be a better choice than
reference I would recommend it and feel
comfortable recommending it at the $265
price point $15 extra not terrible it's
certainly within the oh it's only $15
extra sort of margin where you feel like
you're pushing the budget a bit but for
the better cooler much greater silence
and slight better overclocking potential
there not a huge amount it is worth it
and in my opinion and in the opinion of
the folks at the site like Mike who
helped me test these cards the 1060 is
your most immediate option to look at in
consideration we would recommend looking
at the EVGA 1060 SC review on that
coming and hopefully soon and of course
the RX 470 is coming out very soon we
already published the release date on
that as August 4th so if you are trying
to tighten the budget a bit wait for our
review of that see what you think and
then pick between the three cards based
on how much money you have available for
GPU so as always I'm not going to tell
you which card to buy between the 1060
and the 480 I will tell you avoid this
and go for a partner model if you can
because they are a lot better unless you
really want the blower fan for some
reason maybe an SFF box where the push
fans don't work well so that's all I
will tell you in terms of 1060 and 480
just look through the numbers we've
given them all to you pick based on the
numbers because that's that's all you
need to make a choice so thank you for
