latest APU the a10 78-60 K has a reduced
TDP down to 65 watts an impressive 30
watt reduction over other current AMD
APU switch sit around 95 watts and this
seems to be a trend with AMD lately
there Fiji cards for instance and the
300 series cards both made moves to
change the thermal package of the die to
reduce its TDP reduce its overall heat
output and this is a response from AMD
to criticism from reviewers and users
alike with regard to power and thermal
output of their devices so the a10 78-60
k is what we are reviewing today this is
the new apu it's $120 units and we're
going to be looking at that the new a10
78-60 ka pu launch is accompanied by the
7890 k a high-end apu at 160 ish dollars
that we'll be reviewing separately and
in the near future the 78 60 k runs a 65
watt thermal package while retaining a 2
module 4 core architecture and all the
specs are in the chart on the screen now
but the short of it is that the new $120
78-60 ka pu runs 8gb you cores with 512
streaming processors the very same as
the 78 70 K that we previously reviewed
and the new 78 90k that just came out
the 78 60 k operates base at 3.6
gigahertz but turbos to 4.0 gigahertz
and we've observed some thermal
throttling issues though Andy does
believe that the lower thermal package
should allow for longer turbo periods
the GPU clock is noticeably slower than
the 78 70 K which is now priced at $140
by the way Anna Sony at 60 K runs at 754
megahertz the Sony 870 K at 866
megahertz and the 79 TK s also at 8 66
megahertz so then to the astute viewer
it would sound like the 7/8 60 K is
pretty comparable to the previous 78 70
K and other AMD APU s and that would be
a correct assumption or viewpoint
because the architecture is actually the
same it's just another refresh where
they've done a few reductions to
thermals and they've done reductions in
clock speed to help with those thermals
and to lower the price it is $118 MSRP
7/8 how many K is now 140 and 7 8 9 TK
is around 1
- definitely a pretty steep price for an
APU but we'll look at that separately we
previously said that the 7870 K would
actually be a pretty good buy at around
120 dollars is what the 78 60 K is
priced at now and that statement was
based on the fact that in our tests we
found that cheap CPUs with cheap D GPUs
actually performed much better than a 70
at 70 K at maybe around 10 dollars more
than its 140 $150 ish price range so
today Louis the seventy at 60 K at the
$120 price point we asked for for the 70
at 70 K it's time to look at the clock
rates and the thermal changes here and
see if it impacts FPS to a point that
it's not actually worth the buy or is it
actually a feasible solution for cheap
computers now let's look at the gaming
benchmarks and see if this thing is
actually worthwhile as always check the
article in the description below for
full testing methodology and more depth
will first look at thermals briefly and
then we'll talk about gaming fps our
thermal testing methods were recently
validated with the thermal chamber and
we found them to be nearly perfectly
accurate so for today's test we decided
to change things up a little bit we used
a stock cooler with each of the two ApS
on bench rather than using an identical
cooler for them and so we're looking at
the performance as boxed meaning when
you get the product with the cooler that
is in the Box how does it actually
perform comparatively between the 7/8
1707 e at 60 K with their smaller cooler
master cooler versus the 70 at 70 K with
the Wraiths cooler equilibrium results
show the rates to be a significantly
more efficient cooler no big surprise
there and even with the hotter TDP of
the 70 at 70 K and the higher operating
clock we logged the 70 at 60 K with its
stock cooler and thermal paste @ 29.5 C
delta T over ambient the Wraiths cooled
so need 70 K ran at twenty five point
eight six six C delta T over ambient and
both are fairly and actually fully
acceptable CPU temperatures for AMD
especially and these are impressive
steps in the right direction to be fair
though these ApS are quite a bit cooler
than I am these FX counterparts and do
note as well this is very important that
we had to use T case for CPU thermal
measurements due to software issues with
locating T Junction on AP use time for
gaming benchmarks the first up is GTA 5
on normal setting
using only the IGP so we've got no DGP
you hear the two configurations which
use a DGP you are running an el cheapo
card the r7 250x which plants those
total configuration costs close to the
high-end AP use the 810 78-60 Kalin's
only barely above 20 FPS here making it
effectively unplayable without support
from discrete GPUs to its credit the new
apu does outperform the i3 4160
marginally and it's HD series IGP but
neither lands anywhere remotely close to
the realm of playability GTA v isn't
playable until adding a d GPU to the mix
even a cheap relatively poor performing
to 50x boost FPS by more than 2x over
these apu so definitely a statement
there to the performance levels moving
on to grid Autosport at medium settings
with zero tap AAA we see the cheap d GPU
plus cheap cpu accommodations performing
best with the 7870 k at taking a strong
first amount i gps and AP use and the
new sony at 60 k performs slightly
slower than the 70 at 70 k actually a
good amount slower not just slightly it
is actually a 27.8% difference and both
are more or less able to handle the
racing title with some more tuning but
the AP use and even some intel iGPS
need to be generally tuned slightly
below medium settings for best
playability at 1080p without a d GPU in
grid Autosport at medium settings dota 2
isn't particularly compelling either
which is real shame because this is sort
of the flagship mark for AP use and iGPS
with an FPS that's hardly any better
than an i3 41 60 to 70 at 60 K it leaves
us generally unimpressed and actually
the difference between the i3 and the
760 is imperceptible to a real-world
user the 78 60 K really struggles here
and the gap between the 70 at 60 km 70
at 70 K corresponds with clock rate
throttling that seems resultant of the
hard 65 watt TDP constraint on the new
apu next up a few cpu heavy charts that
run a gtx 980ti at DDP you to eliminate
the GPU bottleneck as much as possible
so here we're looking more at CPU
performance individually shadow of
mordor clearly throttles at around 97
FPS on this particular GPU so hitting 80
FPS with a 78 60 k is
Miraval but does show a clear bottleneck
that is inferior to even an i3 4160 in
this instance if you're planning on
pairing a DGP with your cheap CPU we'd
actually strongly recommend an i3 over a
comparable priced apu looking at Metro
last light the trend somewhat persists
though the i3 CPU does throttle the GPU
pretty heavily here by around 30% the 78
60 K is even worse nearly a 50% throttle
over the 100 FPS matched with the 4790k
note that the point 1 percent low frame
times in the chart these abysmal low
results actually our resultant of the
thread count and really is a one-off
instance with Metro last light the game
is very sensitive to thread count and
not every game reacts this way as you
saw with Mordor which is much more
forgiving with these metrics here's a
look at grid Autosport on the screen now
on ultra with 4 tap MSAA as we mentioned
in the article we've seen a heavy favour
toward Intel in grid so keep that in
mind and the 810 78 60 K nearly achieves
parity with the Sony at 70 K in this
instance but clearly throttles the GPU
massively so is it worth it is the Sony
at 60 K actually good for $120 where we
said the 7870 case should have been
priced well here's the thin for $300
computers or ultra cheap systems it is
actually worth a look because you're
basically at that kind of budget you're
sort of throwing gaming out the window
it's something that you'd like to maybe
do at lowest settings or medium settings
if you can push it but the system's
purpose would be more for everyday use
browsing just to kind of keep things
going with a very slight gaming ability
in the mix and that's really about where
the usability of the APU stops after
that point it becomes a much better
value to buy a cheap CPU like the one of
the athlon x4 is they're actually really
good CPUs and pair it with a cheap GPU
normally we don't really recommend the
cheap D GPUs things less than $100 but
if you're really on a restrictive budget
I would strongly recommend one of those
with a cheap CPU over an APU at 120
especially $160 because once you add it
160 you're basically at the price of
something like an 8 60 K which is a
pretty strong performer matched with
something like an R 7 250 X or one of
the more modern r7
three 40 X cards or something like that
so that's sort of where I stand on those
now there's one critical thing to note
here and that is the dark horse in the
race
and these at new athlon x4 80k was just
announced and that is a CPU only
solution there is no IGP and because
it's got no IGP that means that the cpu
performance is actually pretty strong
comparatively so the AP use and it's got
no actual IGP per bar it's got no
graphics ability so you do need a D GPU
with the solution the AAT K is going to
be $95 the 860 K is already out there
has been out there and basically succeed
in the 760 K which we had in our charts
here today so if you're looking for a
sort of cheap and the CPU less than $100
I would recommend waiting on these ApS
right now wait for the 80k to start
shipping three viewers take a look at
its results and ask yourself once you
see these is it worth buying a $95 CPU
plus maybe I don't know an $80 to $100
GPU and seeing how that goes you're
still at under $200 total for the CPU
and GPU so a pretty good cost see how
that goes versus these APs
you might end up throwing X or 20 or $40
at the solution but for gamers for the
type of people I imagine are following
this channel I would generally suggest
that approach with even a cheap CPU plus
d GPU approach rather than the apu all
in one type of thing except in the
instance of something like a $300 super
cheap build where you are ok with
accepting the life of low graphics
settings medium graphics settings and
just sort of dealing with it as a way to
offset you or your low cost over on the
build so those are the thoughts on the
