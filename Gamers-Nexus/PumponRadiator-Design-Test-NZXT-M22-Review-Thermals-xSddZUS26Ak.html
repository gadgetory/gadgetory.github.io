coolers made by a relatively large
liquid cooling manufacturer NZXT dumped
to a Sutekh for this 120 millimeter
closed-loop cooler instead of opting for
a pump in radiator design that
circumvents aces act patents and permits
sale in the US the m22 is a complement
to NZXT ease asa tech products at the
high end which will still exist but
comes in at $100 and 120 milliliters
that's a bit high for a 120 millimeter
liquid cooler particularly considering
that competition from EVGA CLC 120 comes
in at $70 and is made by the familiar
ace attack but his performance may make
up for the price differential today
we'll find out before that this video is
brought to you by I fix its brand new
Manta driver kit the iFixit Manta kit is
a universal repair tool kit that
includes 112 steel bits redesigned from
the ground up with longer necks for four
millimeter bits allowing more precision
when working on components the $60
iFixit Mantic has everything from
pentalobe drivers to why drivers and
standard bits learn more at the link in
the description below we already have a
teardown video of the NZXT m22 bits and
pieces in front of me so if you haven't
seen that and you're curious you can
check that video out it went up already
but the short of it basically there's a
pump located inside of the radiator that
takes up some of the potential
dissipation room for additional aluminum
fins but it does bypass ASA Tech's
patent registration where they basically
say we're the only people who are gonna
put a pump in the CPU block so it gets
around that in terms of design overall
it's not that different from any other
closed-loop liquid cooler they only work
so many ways there's a copper cold plate
with micro fins in it it's got a gasket
on top of the cold plate so the gaskets
over here and basically helps direct
flow and change modulate the pressure as
necessary for the liquid going through
the micro fins that mounts to what would
be the CPU block except the pump isn't
in there and then the rest of it just
flows through the radiator as it would
do in any other liquid cooler nothing
else has really changed for the most
part so the concerns obviously would be
you're sacrificing some of your aluminum
thin area in the radiator so the dents
of your fin stack is less and
potentially covering some of the airflow
area with that pump located there now
fortunately most of it is right behind a
dead zone on the fan it's behind the hub
so you're not pushing any air really
through the hub anyway maybe some of it
gets out and goes around if there's
enough gap between the fan and the
radiator fins but for the most part it's
not going to be too much of a problem
except this is bigger than just the hub
so the outside edges of the pump do
obstruct some airflow and you do
sacrifice some of the fin stack area so
we'll get to looking into that today the
m22 is $100 the X 42 which is an ASA
tech NZXT cooler 140 millimeter is
presently $115 on Amazon so 15 bucks
more for 140 and we'll see how the
thermal performance is in a moment the
EVGA CLC 120 is presently $70 we never
liked the EVGA CLC 120 in fact our
review of it was pretty critical and
that's because it made absolutely no
sense to buy the two 40s or 280 are so
much better that just doesn't make a
good purchase except the cooler is now
dropped down to $70 so it's pretty
competitive in that regard these days
but there are a lot of 120s out there
that are pretty competitive in price
considering them 20 to 100 bucks to mzx
ease credit the LED is on this cooler
are basically the best in their class
it's just the infinity mirror like they
have on all of the other NZXT liquid
coolers except it's a slightly smaller
block on top but it's still got the cam
integration for RGB LEDs so they've got
that right not many other people do that
in 120 class the cooling might not be
there though so let's go over that first
of all supplier overview this is made by
a pol tech NZXT obviously specifies a
lot of it
they created the PCB for the RGB LED
control that's NZ FC is doing but the
cooler itself the pump is made by a
politic they source a radiate well they
probably make a radiator for this one
and the rest of its all done by them
they make a couple of other coolers as
well they've previously made the
Silverstone Tundra Series coolers for
the most part
suppliers in the industry primarily
include ASA tech sometimes cool it or
cool IT if you prefer and that's really
mostly it Dyna Tron used to make a lot
of stuff doesn't make as much anymore so
those are your suppliers for testing as
always it go to the link in the
description below for the article that
will contain testing methodology and
also some additional information if you
want some more on this cooler let's
start with the 40 DB a noise normalize
charts this is where we basically set
all the coolers the output and
equivalent of 40 decibels of noise at 20
inches of distance for the full system
which uses a passive power supply and
very quiet GPU fan so we're mostly
looking at the cooler noise at this
point and then that allows us to see the
efficiency of the cooler at 40 decibels
to more fairly compared all of them with
one another with their own fans this is
out of the box thermals except at 40
decibels normalized at 40 DBA across the
board the NZXT kraken m22 falls in dead
last attributable in part to reduce
surface area for heat spreading I'm 22
operated at 54 degrees Celsius over
ambient when restricted to 40 DB a
markedly behind EVGA CLC 120 had cooler
that again we didn't like that much and
at 49 degrees over ambient for that one
the reason we didn't like the CLC 120
from EVGA was mostly because alternative
240 products performed better quieter
and we're not that distant in price at
time of launch looking to the crack in X
42 the difference in performance is
tremendous it's about 10 degrees cooler
at 40 DBA than the m22
and cost about $15 more via retail
channels like Amazon that's money well
spent the EVGA CLC 240 is available for
$90 via Amazon these days 10 bucks
cheaper than I'm 22 with the Corsair h
100 IV 2 at $105 either one of these
would be a significantly better choice
in terms of cooling out the price even
the CLC 120 would be though we'd still
advise against it but $70 does help a
quick note here of course there are
places you can't just use it 240 even if
it costs less so in those instances yes
you will still have to use 120 or maybe
a 140 if you can ex 42 if you can fit a
140 is much better than that I'm 22 so
far but there are still other
alternatives in the 120 class so let's
go over a couple of additional numbers
here's an overtime chart that shows the
EVGA CLC 120 with the NZXT fan and the
EVGA fan allowing us to determine
whether the thermal difference was a
result of the fans or results of the
radiator and pump design the NZXT fan is
cooler overall across our power cycling
toward your desk that's why you see the
ups and downs and also deals better with
soaks this leads us to believe that it's
not the fan that's inferior it's
actually better but the radiator and the
pump design which are restrictive in a
few ways one of which being that you're
not getting as much surface area to
spread the heat and the other being that
the impeller as we saw them to tear down
is kind of weak for this chart the NZXT
m22 in flat out thermals lands again
toward the bottom at 53 degrees Celsius
over ambient around equivalence with a
slowed down 1500 RPM EVGA CLC 120 which
operates significantly quieter than the
max speed I'm 22 is 45.8 DBA the x52 a
cooler that we shunted in favor of the X
62 there's a few degrees warmer than the
m22 when cut down to 800 rpm landing at
55 point six degrees Celsius over
ambient it's way more expensive than the
m22 but the H 100 Ivy 2 isn't it's five
dollars more and at a heavily slowed
down and quieted 1050 rpm the H 150 ivt
performs at around 44 degrees over
ambient for this testing unless you
absolutely need both the 120 form factor
and the lighting effects it's hard to
find a place for the m22 moving to noise
at 100% fan speeds the m22 operates at
45.8 DBA not too distant from the X 42
out of 79 at rpm which creates a forty
eight point six DBA total system noise
at 20 inches the EVGA CLC 120 is capable
of maintaining a lower noise level with
equivalent performance or a
significantly higher noise levels at max
fan speed that part is up to the user
obviously so I'm 22 is primarily good
for one user
someone who wants a 120 millimeter form
factor specifically and nothing else
will suffice and that same person must
also want the RGB LED lighting effects
that cam provides through the top of the
block if you don't care about the RGB
LED stuff skip the cooler entirely by
another 120 assuming you need a 120
the UGA CLC 120 is still not our
favorite but at the new $70 price it's
far more arguable and it's not like some
cheapo 120 cooler made by a no-name
supplier it's still made by A's attack
it's basically the same parts you'd get
if you bought a 280 from EVGA the
difference is the radiator is smaller so
in terms of reliability
it'll be fine even though $70 makes it
look a bit cheap I mean you of course
could also go air at that price you
would definitely do pretty well if you
just went with an air cooler but they're
definitely valid reasons to go to 120 so
if you need a 120 and you don't care
about the lights let's give them 22
that's what we're saying if you don't
need a 120 and you do care about the
lights then get something better that's
$90 like a 240 from EVGA from Corsair
the LEDs are not nearly as impressive
with those two we don't think as the
NZXT options so you get the NZXT x 42 if
you really want the LEDs but you want a
better cooler thermally X 42 is
perfectly fine and it's 15 bucks more on
Amazon on average so it's absolutely
worth the money in our opinion and then
finally if you don't need the LEDs at
all and you can go with a larger cooler
there are way better options the H 100
IV 2 is pretty good for the price
especially the EVGA CLC 240 is pretty
good and there are quite a few others
but we'll stick with those too for now
it's kind of the go-to for the current
price in the market they competitive and
they perform basically all the same cuz
their only difference really is fan
noise and fan speed and you can check
our reviews of those for more on those
coolers so that's it for this one the
m22 not really impressed with it the
pump design although it's unique its
creative and they have to be creative if
they're trying to circumvent patent
issues where NZXT is a partner with ace
attack so that gets kind of messy if
they're starting to make things that
don't use easy tech products it might be
in everyone's best interest to try and
not cause problems by going with a
design that doesn't have the pump on the
block and so they did and we have to
give them credit for that it's just that
the design doesn't seem particularly
good so maybe
could be improved you could probably
move the pump to the tank instead that
causes new problems like compatibility
any case I can barely fit it to 40 well
certainly not for the 240 with a pump in
the tank so there are a lot of
challenges here with the patent that
NZXT and anyone else has to work around
if they don't want to use a Sutekh but
they are worried about backlash for Mays
attack in the instance where they're
partnered with them for instance like
NZXT still is so we do give credit for
that it's just as a consumer you don't
buy something because they were unique
you buy something because it was
actually good and this isn't
particularly good except for that very
specific one use case we want the leds
and a 120 form factor in which case by i
guess but an air colored probably better
or any other liquid cooler that's it for
