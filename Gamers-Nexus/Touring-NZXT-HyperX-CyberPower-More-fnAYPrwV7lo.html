nexus dotnet and i am fresh off the
plane sort of from California I just
spent a few days there for Nvidia's game
24 event where they unveiled officially
the GTX 980 that we have already
reviewed as of about a week ago now so
that reviews on the YouTube channel
check the channel for that content and
while out there seen Nvidia and their
GTX 980 and all that cool stuff we
decided hey you know what we're in
Southern California all these companies
are here NZXT is here cyberpower is here
western digital kingston a lot of
companies are there the the bigger ones
like nvidia and intel r up in norcal in
silicon valley but a lot of the major
manufacturers are in Southern California
so we visited them and I just wanted to
show you some footage of our tour
through their offices and warehouses and
assembly lines and all that stuff I have
previously toward Kingston where you can
see their smt line how ram and SSDs are
made but we went back for more we also
visited NZXT here's sort of here's a
look at NZXT in these shots you can see
some of their designs done by shin fen
and he is their design director these
are ideas that have come to fruition
there's some of the case you might
actually recognize some of these as
phantom series or Age series or s series
cases that have come to be manufactured
and it all starts here in these designs
and you can actually see in the in the
on the wall here that some of them are
influenced from things like the Loom
ixia by nokia or whoever makes that
camera and yachts and things like that
just sort of all come inspiration comes
from everywhere i guess is what you can
say and this is where it starts for NZXT
they also have a giant warehouse where
they ship out dozens
of H 4 40's and other cases phantom 4
tens every day and we got to see that so
here's a still and some photos and video
moving on from NZXT which was a really
fun visit by the way they have some cool
stuff on the horizon we did videos can't
talk about it yet but stay tuned
subscribe to the YouTube channel and you
will see it as soon as we are allowed to
post so moving on from NZXT we visited
Kingston's hyperx group the HyperX group
is sort of a a gaming subdivision of
Kingston technologies it is a hundred
percent focused on gaming products that
includes ram and SSDs and now it
includes things like headsets as well
and potentially other peripherals in the
future so hyper x has its own fully
revamped office it's got a really nice
vibe to it be sort of a cool place to
work but inside there is a studio for
eSports events because kinston does
sponsor quite a few teams some very
large ones in the MOBA and used I don't
know if they still do but they
definitely use the sponsor EG starcraft
2 group and that all happens here for
show matches so they've got a really
cool 5vs5 setup that's moot lit with red
vs. blue lighting and it's used for show
matches and streams and things like that
so that is the HyperX group next we
visited CyberPower and cyber power and I
by power and all of these system
integrators digital storm all of them we
generally don't talk about a whole lot
because our site is about building your
own computer but there are definitely
times when when it is useful to have it
sourced by someone else if you don't
want to do it or if you are
uncomfortable doing it or if it's for a
friend or something like that and you
just don't have time so we visited
CyberPower got to see their assembly
line got to see some cool systems did a
very good video on a collaboration
between cyberpower and NZXT that will be
online very shortly within the next
hopefully 24 hours of this video being
posted
assembly is pretty cool we actually
inflated one of the packs that keeps the
video card in place that's what you're
seeing right now these are used so that
the video card does not crack or rip the
pci express slot out when the system is
shipped and most of the system
integrators use this I I by Bauer
included and we also toured them as
you'll see in some footage and basically
the way these companies work or at least
CyberPower is they receive an order
think of it like a ticket at a
restaurant they receive an order they
give it to the appropriate system
builder their varying levels of
expertise they build the system it takes
anywhere from 13 minutes for a sort of
template boilerplate newegg etail system
too much longer for custom liquid loops
build it put it on the conveyor belt
send it down it goes down to the pixie
boot guys who pixie image and and ghosts
and operating system onto the drive
along with all the drivers they do burn
and testing for several hours to make
sure the components are good and then
they ship it out from there so that is
how these these facilities work we also
visited i buy power what you're seeing
right now they have a very similar
operation set up it's sort of receive an
order build it ship it down the assembly
line have it burned in all that stuff
very similar in process and we were
given a tour through there and i have a
full full video talking about all the
machines used all the packing stuff it's
really some cool technology even if
you're not a fan of sis or system
integrators so that was the tour of
California's southern companies at least
the ones we had time to see and we will
of course be back for more subscribe to
the YouTube channel if you like this
content there's plenty of it from our
previous California trip that was
somewhat a literate of and hard to say
and I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
