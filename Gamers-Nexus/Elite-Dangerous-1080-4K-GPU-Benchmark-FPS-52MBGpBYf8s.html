Donna and this benchmark is looking at
elite dangerous which is another space
simulator game and it's bit different
than star citizen in scope but was
actually backed by chris Roberts who is
of course the chairman and CEO of cloud
Imperium games the developers behind
star citizen so it has their endorsement
and the difference here is that elite
dangerous is done it is out it's
complete and really that's that's that
its final yes it's still being iterated
upon but I'm like star citizen it is
available for play now star citizen
still in development for at least
another year maybe two or more so elite
dangerous I already published the
benchmark course if you're interested in
that you can see the course that I took
when benchmarking the game and sort of
look at the graphics it looks pretty
good I played it at 1440 and even 4k
when benchmarking but of course the
heart of it is at 1080 so in terms of
graphics there's nothing crazy here it's
not like some of the other recent games
where there are all of these new
technologies or Nvidia or AMD competing
technologies there's not any game work
stuff being pushed it elite dangerous
it's pretty straightforward in that
really the bulk of the graphics are the
HUD and things like Space Station's do
draw on the GPU a bit but that's because
it's just rendering a lot of polygons
and not necessarily because of any new
FX or special effects at 1080p
the game plays really on just about
anything I tested it from a 250 X
scaling up to 980 the 980 ran it at 160
FPS which shows you that even on a 35 70
K there's really not much of a CPU
bottleneck which sits that's good news
and the 290x plays it at about 140 fps
780 113 so all is well in the terms of
these cards it does struggle on a 250 X
I would probably not recommend playing
it on max settings on a 250 X but you
could drop the settings quite a bit this
this was run on max so you could drop
them down to low and you'll be fairly
okay on a 250 AD I would really
recommend upgrading though for this
instance moving on I ran the benchmark
with DSR and VSR which are dynamic super
resolution by and
and I believe virtual super-resolution
by Andy and the two technologies are
very similar in scope in that they
simulate a 4k or 1440p display so
although there's a filtration process
the component of the card that does the
scaling friend but for AMD excuse me the
scalar component is removed from the
graphics pipeline that means that it is
not impacting the framerate output in
this filtration process so your
performance it will be almost identical
to the hit you would find using an
actual 1440 or 4k display despite the
extra filtration added in on top of it
because it is removed from the pipeline
at 1440 p vs r and d sr the 980 drops
down to a hundred fps you remember it
was 160 on 1080 and the 285 drops to 56
fps to 90 X to 85 so it is definitely
playable at 1440 with these cards you
would not want to go below a 285 or a
780 for the most part if you're playing
at 1440 if you have a higher resolution
display 3k or 4k in that range the only
things I could test with this for the
285 and 980 because AMD's VSR is only
available up to 4k on the 285 everything
else is limited to 1800 HP which would
be 32 by 18 and the 980 is the only one
powerful enough to run 4k so I just
didn't even bother testing the others in
this instance the 980 s sort of slightly
playable at 4k but you're definitely
gonna hit some spikes that are very
noticeable in gameplay as I did
especially when flying around space
stations and getting into really intense
combat so you probably would want
something a bit more powerful or a multi
GPU setup if we're being realistic
that's ultimately what you would need to
drive 4k @ a consistently playable fps
so that's all for this benchmark please
let me know what you think about elite
dangerous because I honestly have not
had much of a chance to play it I've
just been benchmarking so I'm curious to
hear your thoughts you can comment below
but the best way to get in touch with us
