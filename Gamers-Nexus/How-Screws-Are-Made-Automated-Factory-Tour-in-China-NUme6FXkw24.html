six hours before we got to this factory
we're in a screw Factory
take the introductory screw class which
the factory managers will use to teach
us about how screws are made for PC
cases video cards coolers and even cars
or semi trucks the factory is
responsible for producing 2 point 1
million screws every single month for
about 25 million screws per year and
it's commonly used as a third-party
supplier for the computer hardware
industry Coolermaster took us on this
tour to show where the screws for their
cases and coolers are made including
liquid cooler products like the ML 240
cases like the SL 600 M and coolers made
for partners that were oddly not allowed
to name but we are allowed to show not
exactly sure who these particular case
and cooler parts are made for but they
do look familiar to other parts that
we've covered in the past must be a
coincidence in this video we'll be
learning about how screws are made
before that this video is brought to you
by mass drop and the PC 37 X gaming
headset with professional-grade
Sennheiser noise cancelling microphone
the PC 37 X headsets are what we use in
the office for phone interviews where
audio and mic quality are critical
making it very convenient high
performance solution for gaming or
professional work the headphones come
with a detachable ten-foot cable for
safe storage during travel a standard
3.5 millimeter plug and soft foam for
firm but comfortable fit over the ears
the PC 37 X headphone stand apart with
high mic quality mixed with high quality
audio output learn more at the link in
the description below
screws are purchased from third-party
suppliers for one obvious reason the
world uses screws and just about
everything and so screw making factories
have been around a long time they're
well established and they're able to
mass-produce at lower cost and greater
efficiency than any individual computer
hardware manufacturer could ever hope to
match as such it's better to use a
third-party supplier that specializes in
the task and then just buy the screws to
spec screws start life buried in the
earth of course but as the various
metals are dug out they are turned into
spools of metal wire that gets shipped
to this factory the supply chain is a
long one before Coolermaster ever
even buys a screw and before this
factory makes one the wire first has to
be made by a different factory which
buys the raw materials from refineries
who can either buy from a mining company
or are part of what various other
chemicals are involved in the process
all coming from different suppliers in
the chain
the first machine is at lawn and takes
about half of the factory's width for
the first floor there are about a dozen
of these in this one line each costing
about 70,000 RMB or about ten thousand
four hundred US dollars in April of 2019
these machines to straighten the steel
wire through the length of the machine
then feed it into a set of six tools at
the end of the line including taps
thighs forming tools and cutting tools
the machine dumps cutting oil into the
tools and the steel wire helping keep
things cool and lubricated and
preventing rust it's also a recyclable
operation so the factory will reuse much
of this oil for continuous operation
although it eventually does have to
purge it as it becomes too dirty the
tools each have different jobs like
cutting the threads into the screw the
standoff of the bolt depending on the
day or tapping the screw if threading it
internally the screw is fed through
slowly as the cutting tools work on
creating the threads and shaping the
screw then is eventually cut at the tip
and dropped into a bucket for collection
some of the screws we saw being made are
standoffs or non PC applications but the
same idea applies there's an internal
and external threading for these as they
both insert into a threaded hole and
then receive a screw on the other side
and so multiple tools are required just
to make one one of the other machines
used is equipped with multiple dies for
making different parts of the screw this
one also makes screws from a long spool
of steel wire and can make between
10,000 and 20,000 screws per day
depending on the type of screw as the
wire enters the machine it compresses to
make it as wide as the screw needs to
end up be the wire is cut compressed
twice make it bigger and then cut again
depending on the screw either a mold can
be used to punch out different shapes or
this machine is used to tap and die and
cut the screw down to size different
dies on the machine can be used for
creating the head of the screw and
shaping the tip of the screw including
chamfering Aldana in a step-by-step
process
throughout the entire production of the
screw we were given a set of screws from
each stage in the process showing the
metal wire the wire next chamfered on
one end and then the screw head that's
created each part of the machine is
controlled by a series of gears and
wheels for which we have a lot of fuel
and each of those is covered in oil for
smooth operation and for cooling
purposes the wheels turn to keep the
gears moving which moves the dies onto
the steel wire to process the screws
this happens ad infinitum and goes on
for at least 10 hours a day it's largely
automated the process only required for
overseers for the entire factory floor
that we were on so there are four people
for dozens of machines all responsible
for producing tens of thousands of
screws per day the most manual part of
the process is replacing that steel wire
we saw earlier whenever it runs out it
obviously has to be renewed and that's
done by the human operator but the rest
is mostly done by machine this factory
makes 50 to 60 different types of screws
in production per day working about 10
hours per day when we asked how many
tons of metal the factory goes through
per day the manager just shrugged and
laughed but did tell us that they see
about 200 metric tons of brass aluminum
steel and stainless steel of metals
enter the factory every month so you can
do the math on that the screws coming
out of the machine are hot to the touch
and coated in oil they accumulate here
until ready for delivery to the quality
control room upstairs moving upstairs we
get to the quality control section of
the factory the primary machine is an
automatic optical inspection device but
it's not the same as the Aoi machine
seen in the SMT lines and it uses a
laser to check screws for compliance to
the customers tolerances that are
defined on the customer places the order
P CK screws have a much wider tolerance
for error than what we're seeing here
they're used in an application which
doesn't require intense precision of for
example aeronautical equipment the
customer currently occupying the
obstacle inspection machine has zero
tolerance for failure the screws are
dumped into a sort of hopper that
rotates and feeds the screws down a
track and toward the inspection machine
as the screw exits the hopper they slide
down a metal ramp and onto a spinning
disk
screws that were not standing on entry
will be rolled into a collecting bin
simply by using the turning of the disk
these are reclaimed and fed back through
later another wheel is used to push
screws to the outer edge so that they
align with the laser screws go through
laser inspection for both circumference
and threading which then communicates
with software on whether the screw
passed or fail screws that succeed are
blasted with air to kick them off of the
wheel and onto a chute that leads to a
bucket of past screws screws that failed
are sent through a second time to be
double-checked as sometimes false
positives can be thrown by the optical
inspection if the screw fails twice in a
row its bend as potentially bad and sold
to a company that melts down medals for
reuse each individual type of screw is
sorted into bags by weight after this
the screws are bagged and marked for
sale to the customer and for example
coolermaster buys by the screw so they
might order for example ten thousand but
the factory uses weight to calculate the
appropriate amount of screws based on
that order quantity there's some error
and variance baked in but when dealing
in tens of thousands of units per order
it's really the best approach as for
some of the bigger pieces of machinery
in the factory the most expensive
machine we saw cost three hundred
seventy two thousand the USD and
requires a team to configure it also
takes about five minutes to set it up
the machine has to be warmed up before
operation and is used to make large
bolts and screws for non computer
applications one example would be screws
used in the industrial automotive
applications that we discussed earlier
the machine cuts and drills into the
screws extending the tubes high Mullaney
ously the first step is to cut the wire
chamfer the edges after that then
chamfer and crimp the other side after
this the machine drills halfway into the
screw to begin creating the threads then
the remainder of the wire is pulled
through and extended at the same time as
the drilling process proceeds six
different tools are used to make just
this one screw with the robotic arm not
an operation for today used to pick up
and move the tools around we have shots
of each of the stages from the machine
as it progresses showing how the wire
transforms from a steel rod into actual
hardware and that's how screws are made
