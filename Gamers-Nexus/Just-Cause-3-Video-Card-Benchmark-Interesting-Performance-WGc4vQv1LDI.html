dotnet and this is our Just Cause at
three video card benchmark so obviously
looking at all the different GPS that we
have and the Nvidia alike and testing
them on the new square enix published
game Just Cause 3 which is a
continuation of a somewhat long-standing
series at this point it's basically an
open-world destroy things game and that
makes it interesting to benchmark it's a
unique challenge and there's submit
there's some cool graphics tech in the
game there's some technology for the
global illuminations for water and for
things like that that enable the very
law and view distances this is part of
being an open world is that you can see
very far obviously so there's some level
of detail scaling that's fairly
intensive compared to what you might
find in other games of the open-world
nature Skyrim as an old example has
always been very reserved in its
presentation of detail and if you look
at the LOD the level of detail and the
view distances that's sort of where
they're able to preserve performance
they don't actually draw that many
objects very far with Just Cause 3 a lot
of stuff still gets drawn pretty far out
things like active objects actors which
would be characters cars other vehicles
things like that don't get drawn too far
away but with the terrain you can see
pretty far with the landscape in general
the water you can see that it's not as
high-quality as if you were up close but
the general idea here is that there's a
lot of detail and it goes pretty far
away in terms of view distance so some
of the more interesting items in terms
of graphics settings you can find the
full list in the article by the way
length of the description below if you
want to learn more about the graphic
settings in Just Cause 3 but off the top
here the most interesting ones would
generally be water detail first and
foremost because that is a game works
enabled technology within Just Cause 3
so that would be part of the Nvidia game
works suite which as all of you know is
sometimes controversial but at the end
of the day it's in there so we got to
talk about it that is called wave works
the specific implementation of the game
works toolkit that is that is in there
as wave works and that helps enable
things like
Crest's and wakes behind ships and
players and all kinds of splash effects
and things like that so that is in there
and then there's also water tessellation
tessellation we've talked about a few
times now there's a good video on the
channel already where we talked to
someone from Epic Games about
tessellation what it is what it means
regaining but to recap quickly
tessellation is effectively
multiplication of triangles so in a game
world most things are compared all
things actually are comprised of some
sort of triangle or quad or some very
basic rudimentary geometry this table as
an example this table is a rectangle in
real life in a game it might be drawn as
two triangles kind of divided down the
middle with tessellation what you do is
you take the triangles that are that are
already being used to create an object
the composition of an object and you
multiply them and that multiplication
creates greater apparent depth and I use
the word apparent very specifically it
looks like there's more detail you can
see more bumps and roughness and grit in
the surface for example and that is done
through tessellation so water
tessellations in here specifically for
water it basically makes it look more
like a natural fluid rather than kind of
a weird glue-like substance that you
might find in some games the next thing
is Elodie factor so Elodie is level of
detail talks about it a bit already and
that just scales how much details in
different types of graphics elements
within the game as you distance yourself
from them so for example meshes a mesh
is a really easy example meshes it's
just like real life meshes where you
have sort of a almost a wire frame frame
underlying the whatever the model is so
think of a clay model right you have a
wire frame of a car and on top of that
you put your clay so there's your mesh
and your modeling going on with the LOD
factor scaling it down will reduce the
complexity and the appearance of detail
or depth of different objects in the
game to include their host meshes and it
also scales down things like textures so
textures will pop in a bit slower
depending on your LOD scaling and they
will also
have the lower resolutions rendered for
a longer period as you approach them
with lower LOD scaling so that's the
other one and then global illumination
is pretty important this is the item
that deals with reflections and
interacting with bounces of light so
when you have a light source in a game
you have the light source a cast array
of light and it hits an object and it
illuminates that object with global
illumination you're saying I'm going to
take this ray of light that's hitting a
car and now we're going to look at the
car we're going to say ok this is a
metallic surface this has some
reflectivity to it and we're going to
bounce that light off of the metallic
surface appropriate to the reflectivity
or whatever index the game developers
are using to determine how reflective
that object is then you trace the light
through its bounces until it stops
bounty until it actually runs out of
energy will call it so that's global
illumination lowering that or turning it
off in this instance will just eliminate
the multi bounced lighting will call it
and so that makes your light in a bit
more simplistic but it saves your own
performance methodology is defined in
the article if you want to learn about
how we tested this there are some pretty
specific things going on and the main
thing is we have very high and high
settings that were tested when we say hi
what we mean is we changed all the
options to say the word high and then we
also disabled ssao global illumination
motion blur and screen space reflections
to create our version of high settings
because there are no presets very high
we turned it all on and said it's very
high and for AAA we always used FXAA for
the anti-aliasing our benchmark course
is already separately on the channel at
max graphics but you can see it again in
this video if not right now and that
course shows the obligatory completion
of missions that were at the very
beginning of the game so we've already
completed those first few missions that
you have to complete and we're now
released freely into the open world and
that is when we started the benchmark
search so I looked at a few different
things here and the main items that I
looked at included combat and
destruction included grass hills foliage
and
geometry and we also looked at cities
which would be included in that dense
geometry things like action elements
cars combat again with different levels
of movement or different items used to
fight like grenades and exclusives to
looked at all that stuff and ultimately
determined that when running on this one
line segment up a grass hill we had the
most intensive experience with the game
out of all the other stuff so the city's
weren't nearly as intensive at least the
ones that I was able to test and the
combat although it was intensive it
seems to be a general theme that
anything which was highly explosive like
all of the fuel tanks and silos and
things like that they all tended to be
in areas of low geometric or object
complexity so you actually had a higher
average fps and then when you blew that
stuff up it ate into that and ultimately
produced a low FPS during the explosions
that was similar and comparable to what
we see in our grassland fields benchmark
so we went with that because you want to
reduce any chance of test variants you
want to be a hundred percent
reproducible and reliable in your
results and so we want to eliminate any
type of dynamic element within the game
or possible that's where we came up with
our worst-case scenario so again this is
a worst-case scenario you will generally
have higher FPS when you're grappling
around or traveling through cities or
what have you but other words times the
charts you'll see here are what you can
expect for game play and it's it's it's
fairly complex in terms of the search
that we set forth and you can learn more
about that and all of our other GPU test
methodology pieces where we talked about
how we test games let's get started with
4k unlike competitive shooters Just
Cause 3 doesn't demand for a constantly
high FPS we found that the game is
fairly playable at 50 FPS average and
there's some negative impact to fluidity
once you drop below 50 FPS but generally
it's playable at about that range
obviously more is better for the most
part with some limitations but you won't
need the exact 60 that we normally do
for some shooters the gtx 980 TI runs
Just Cause 3 at just under 50 FPS
average when at 4k and high that's all
high settings with the disabled FX
options that we already mentioned the
one percent and 0.1 percent lows are
pretty bad really and they both run
under 30 FPS so that makes for some
unpleasant spikey periods of gameplay
but this is a worst-case benchmark
design so generally if you tweak a few
settings down on the 980 TI it will be a
fairly fluid playing experience until
the worst case scenarios at which point
it will still be playable it just hit
some wacky times there is effectively
zero sli scaling revealed in our testing
and we talked on video about this it is
a known issue they're working on it
they're implementing new updates to the
drivers and so forth to improve SLI
scaling a single gtx 980 i right now is
about as good as two of them at least in
this case and you'll see that trend
continues more or less through the other
charts the gtx 980 runs at 40.5 FPS
average at 4k and the 390 x hits 42 FPS
average a bit higher neither of these
cards though produces a frame rate we
really find comfortable for play and the
settings or resolution would have to be
tweaked to make them better for
playability the gtx 980 TI at 1440p
however runs Just Cause 3 at about 65
FPS average so that's 1440p and very
high with the lows at about half of that
the gtx 980 is 16.7 percent behind the
980 I and is playable at 55 FPS on our
worst case scenario the 390 X also hits
55 FPS making it playable though does so
with lower one percent and 0.1 percent
frame rate so that be 22.5 vs. 30 + 20.5
verse 28 pretty big difference there and
generally not pleasant but it's still
within playable range and you can make
some tweaks to improve that looking
further down the list we see the r9 290x
is still playable at its 51 FPS average
output with the GTX 970 trailing just
behind and again I'd recommend some
settings tweaks to both of these cards
to maybe drop high to medium
something like that to keep a more
consistent 50-plus FPS and I left
crossfire tests in this particular chart
because it demonstrates a lack of
crossfire scaling at this time a future
driver will likely resolve this but
right now there's zero crossfire scaling
and SLI scaling is very small it's what
Cup will present that very best so
multi-gpu configurations are not too
happy with this game right now look into
1080p at very high this is probably the
key setting or most users will be
targeting with this configuration
anything including and north of the r9
380 effectively equivalent to the r9 285
in the above chart because we don't have
a 380 anymore it was on loan or the gtx
960 for gigabyte at 210 dollars would be
sufficient for Just Cause 3 but you'd
probably want to make a few settings
tweak to the lower end cards like the 3
80 to 85 and 9 60s for better sustained
frame rates during intensive periods the
9 64 gigabyte and 962 gigabytes show a
small disparity to FPS or 4.3 percent
but nothing nearly as interesting as
what we saw on AC syndicate you can
check that content if you're curious
about the tubers for gigabyte disparity
take a look at the r9 390 X in this
charge so again we're looking at the
1080 and very high chart 3 90 X versus
the GTX 970 at very high the 390 X leads
the 970 by a couple percent so you're at
75 or 71 FPS the 390 X also stands
higher one present low FPS so commit
that to memory for a moment and we'll
come back to it in a couple of minutes
here or less moving down to high and
disabling some of the FX like guess Sao
go illumination excuse me screen space
reflections and so forth FPS improves
considerably on most GPUs and this is
particularly visible at the low end
where the somewhat aged and decrepit r9
270x once a powerhouse for the budget
class now enters a range of relative
playability despite poor 1% in 0.1
percent low frame times the GTX 950 is
outperformed by the r9 285 and thus the
r9 380 marginally with the r9 380 x
taking a more
lead of five point nine percent over the
gtx 960 cards now here's the part that
we're bringing back from every the gtx
970 is at 102 FPS average which leads
the r9 390 X in this benchmark something
we've seen recently in other titles
especially those that make use of
tessellation heavily like fallout and
Assassin's Creed is that the 970 does
actually leave the 390 acts in a lot of
games these days 390 X however appears
advantaged at the highest quality
setting which is the one we looked at a
moment ago but loses ground at lower
quality settings so here the 970 is
actually a bit ahead and previously the
970 was a bit behind a moment ago for
example to recap everything the 390 X
wasn't a lead of a couple percent pretty
small and this Delta between the 973 90
X with the 970 the lead is 11 point two
percent at the same resolution just some
settings tweaked we haven't yet found
the cause of this but I did substantial
research with the site's Mike gaglione
and we spent a few extra hours of
validation trying to figure out what it
was I haven't found it yet but the
narrowed down list of settings is SSAO
global illumination and texture quality
and that's what we're researching next
so we'll let you guys know if we figure
out what's going on with this disparity
and it requires for the research so what
are the best cards were just cause 3
looking at things from the 1080 range
first the 1080 settings with very high
play best on a 970 or 3 90 x not too
surprising that's fairly common for
these games the 970 is a bit better
value in this case in terms of frames
per dollar it's cheaper these days and
the 390 X if you want Andy or you're
pushing towards another game where it's
advantaged it's not a bad Buy it's just
not the best value comparatively at 1080
with high the options I look at would be
the r9 380 x sort of at the top end of
that it's six percent faster than the
gtx 960 on average or the r9 380 which
is comparable to the 285 in these charts
or the gtx 960 4 gigabyte card if you're
planning on playing games that work vram
intensive like AC syndicate although
that game struggles on the 960 to begin
with so those would be by three main
options for 1080 and high and then at
1440 are basically looking at a 980 TI
or a 980 both of which are very solid
performing cards and consistent with
1440 performance but neither which will
play 4k very well at this particular
point in time with Just Cause 3 so until
there's some sort of SLI optimization or
other optimization 4k is not super
playable on Just Cause 3 right now you
can make it work with some settings
drops but no one really wants to do that
because then you're just blowing up
lower settings at a much higher solution
although it's not terrible depending on
the game but this game I don't like it
so that's where I would go for different
cards different settings and things like
that post and comfortable if you have
any questions and check out the full
