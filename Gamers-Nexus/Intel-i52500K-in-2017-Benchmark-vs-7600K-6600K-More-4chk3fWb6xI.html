most popular processor of its time along
sides of 2600 K Sandy Bridge has been
able to hold strong through several
generations of Intel processors and
Andy's next big architecture launch is
only just now occurring then should be
here in February and KB Lake has already
arrived so now it seems like a good time
to finally start considering upgrades
from Sandy Bridge and that's what we're
testing today before we get into that
this coverage is brought to you by
Thermaltake and their Corp III ATX case
which is wall mountable and can act as
an easy access test bench with high
quality materials
learn more at the link in the
description below in this revisit of the
i-5 2500 case and E Bridge processor
we'll be testing sandy bridges that stay
in power into 2017 we've got the 2600 K
on here but we're focusing on the 2500 K
for today
this includes blender rendering speeds
that would be a production application
and workload which is a bit more unique
because there's some multi-threading
advantage there and we looking at a
handful of modern games watchdogs to
Battlefield 1 all of those a couple of
synthetic tests just to provide a
baseline of numbers and this testing is
limited to performance so we're looking
at FPS and completion time for
benchmarks thermal power all that
stuff's been done for this processor and
it hasn't changed so we're not going to
be revisiting it today the 2500 K
alongside the 60 series of chipsets or
the 6 Series that would be stains like
z68 do you remember that chipset and
platform but it was also compatible with
these 77 motherboards critically and
that's sort of still true today where we
have z170 z2 70 have some inter
compatibility depending on which CPU
you're looking at for potential upgrade
so 2500 K also has a base frequency of
3.3 gigahertz and a turbo is up to 3.7
gigahertz and it can fairly effortlessly
overclock to 4.5 gigahertz or there
abouts may be a 1.3 voltage and you can
tune plus or minus based on your
particular processor with the right
cooler so it was a flexible CPU and now
it's just important to see how it's held
up as for TDP and other specs that CPU
had the same TDP as modern Intel CPUs
though it's significantly less powerful
and operates at a lower clock rate which
hand-in-hand the memory support on the
2500 K was also limited and it's
somewhat critical to performance changes
in some specific applications the right
motherboard went a long way in this
regard you can still run the higher
memory speeds but still not anything
like what we have today and of course
there's a ddr3 vs ddr4 chains as well
and a case anyone's forgotten the i/o
has changed a lot since 2011 so HS i/o
now consists of things like m2 nvme and
a whole slew of devices that are enabled
via the PCIe bus and that's not really
something that was that popular or even
in some cases like nvm II didn't even
exist when the CPU came out especially
not in consumer applications so that's a
big change and it's something you should
account for with upgrade plans because
moving forward even if the percent gains
may be minimal in some use cases the
advantage from new i/o devices could be
a lot higher than just a raw CPU gain
and of course PCIe gen3 is now
everywhere and USB 3 multiple
generations of it even Gen 1 and Gen 2
have pretty much proliferate in the
market so the markets been shaken up a
lot for i/o and that's probably the
biggest change here other than the usual
clock rate and because we're testing so
many CPUs on different platforms that
means that we have multiple test benches
to define those are all defined and the
article link in the description below
which also contains a few extra charts
that won't be in this video check that
link if you have any questions about
what motherboard was used and what
memory was used because we'll be
changing between ddr3 and 4 of course as
we iterate through the CPU generations
and that's all defined in the article
test methodology page one more thing to
note here before getting started this is
our edition of i5 CPU to the CV
benchmark this was promised in our i7
7700 K review next will be to add a 3s
and FX CPUs each one of these sort of
core series updates does take a lot of
work so we're doing them incrementally
fxs to ni3 'soon and that is in
preparation of course for Xen and for
the i3 KB Lake CPUs that we'll be
looking at shortly the first test is our
blender benchmarks at GM's Andrew
Coleman made the full methodology is on
the site again but
basics are that we're rendering a 4k
image of these various monkey heads each
monkey has different effects applied to
it all stressing the components in
different ways during GPU benchmarking
for instance we notice that the fur
monkey stresses GPU memory in some ways
that are not the same for CPUs as the
chart demonstrates this is a benchmark
where multi-threaded CPU is really shine
the additional threads are fully
utilized for each 16 by 16 pile that we
render so two times the threads means
two times the active in flight tiles
being rendered simultaneously we already
talked to i7 numbers in the 7700 K
review so we're focusing on the core i5
CPU today the Intel i5 2500 K with its
stock frequency settings is able to
render our scene and 106 minutes making
it the slowest device on the bench by a
long shot the 35 70 K CPU released about
a year later in second quarter 2012
completes the frame in 94 minutes a
modern CPU like last gens i5 6600 K is
able to complete that task in 73 minutes
and of course the 7600 K is a bit faster
than that so we're looking at about a 30
minute faster render time over the 2500
K or a reduction of about 31% time
required between the 2500 K and the 6600
K if you're rendering using this CPU as
you might do if running both GPU and CPU
on a render task then the upgrade is
clearly substantial and something that
should have been done a long time ago to
provide some perspective for Sandy
Bridge the same gen I 720 600 K is able
to render the scene at about the same
time as an i5 6600 K a
multi-generational difference at 74
minutes if you bought an i7 2608 you're
still in pretty decent shape in this
particular benchmark at least compared
to today's i5 CPU a trivial overclock to
4.5 gigahertz on the 2500 K moves us up
to an 82 minute render time absolutely a
worthwhile improvement and if you're
stuck on the cpu rendering intro a while
it's probably something that should be
done let's move on to Cinebench
synthetics we're seeing the i-5 2500 K
operate expectedly at the bottom of the
bench the 2500 K is pushing single core
performance at 124 C D Marx was
multi-core at 460 marks the overclocked
variant at 4.5 gigahertz again
pretty easy performs ahead of the i5
3570 ka saag cpu and just under the i5
4690k in a single core and even in
multi-core performance 3d Mars fire
strike is posting the i5 2500 K at 13
for 98 total points or six one nine zero
on physics and that's the score we care
the most about since its isolates the
CPU and remove the GPU from the equation
the 3570 KS off marginal improvements to
6 808 and the 2600 K is pretty heavily
improved in physics when it's nine is
zero three three score as for what this
means in practice here's the 3d mark FPS
output we're seeing a physics FPS of
19.7 on the twenty five hundred K
compared to twenty six one overclock the
i-5 35 70 K on 4690k both fall between
the stock and overclocked 2500 kcp use
there's some variants intestinal 3d
marks so keep that in mind but these
results are reliable nonetheless there
is just a bit of variance between tests
and that's all synthetic of course and
there's only so far we can get with
synthetics we've got times five
benchmarks in the article links below if
you'd like to see more but with newer
api's but let's move on to FPS
benchmarks for now there are a lot of
different ways to do game benchmarks for
CPUs so again article below for the full
methodology but the basics are we've
mixed in some CPU limited games and then
a couple that would appear to be GPU
limited once you reach the high end but
do show some pretty substantial changes
as we approach the low end of CPUs where
the GPU is now being bottlenecked by the
CPU so there's still worthwhile to test
and provide a fuller picture of actual
performance across various games rather
than just a whole bunch of carefully
picked CPU benchmarks starting with
watchdogs
2 we can now reveal why we added this
game to our CV benchmarking workload
with the high end i7 CPUs we undoubtedly
begin to battle with other system
resources like the GPU even though it's
a GT X 1080 FTW in the system and that
means the differences between the
skylake and KB like i7 cpus are harder
to detect as we scale down though the
CPU choke becomes readily apparent the
2500 K is limiting our 1080 FTW to 59
FPS average when at 1080p with high
settings and that's a card which is
capable of achieving that clearly at
least 2 X 5 performance when using the
latest
cpu's if you're running the a stock i-5
2500 K this is about the maximum
performance you can expect on our
particular benchmark course primetime
performance isn't exactly bad it just
scales linearly with the average so 35
70 K shows a reasonable improvement but
even that gain is outdone by an
overclock on the 2500 K at a 4.5
gigahertz this isn't hard to do and can
be held at around 1.3 volts so your
mileage may vary and produces higher
averages and 0.1% lows then the 35 70 K
is capable of more interestingly we see
the same gen 2,600 K really stretch its
legs and watchdogs to producing an
additional 15 or so frames per second on
the 2500 K this is where you get your
value in those i7 purchases several
years ago better longevity mostly and
it's probably one of the most
interesting stories here we'll soon see
if that carries over to other games
though with watchdogs to were generally
seeing that multi-core CPUs are
advantaged and the i5 4690k in 4790k i7
CPU have a sizable gap between them as
well
furthering this point but as for the
2500 K versus modern TV purchases a
linear upgrade would land you on the
7600 or 6600 K it was which produced an
extra 20 FPS or so average frame rate
throughput frame times improve in step
with this and watchdogs is a game where
you could generally get by with the
lower FPS so the upgrade isn't necessary
you could be pretty happy at 40 to 45
FPS if not a stickler for hitting 60 all
the time but the point is that an
upgrade would better allow for higher
graphics settings where at high here but
moving to ultra would be more acceptable
with a higher-end cpu battlefield 1
doesn't show as much change at the very
high end where our 1080p ultra settings
are landing the KB Lake sky Lake and
Devil's Canyon i7 CPU is all roughly in
the same performance range where we do
see a change though is dropping down to
the 2500 kctu the 2500 case don't
performs reasonably well in battlefield
1 despite becoming a bottleneck with
1080 FTW and is operating at 115 FPS
average with the overclocked version at
124 FPS average the 35 70 K performs
about where the overclocked 2500 K
performs and the 4690k starts pulling
away from the 2500 in a more
dramatic fashion the CPU is certainly
slower but still keeps up pretty well in
battlefield 1 only if you're pushing for
higher refresh gameplay or upgrading
into 10 17 10 to 80 class hardware will
a bottleneck could be really noticeable
to a point of requiring that CPU upgrade
unlike wall socks to the difference
between the I 720 605 2500 KCBS is not
as substantial total war is new to our
CPU bench and thus far only features i5
series CPUs before diving in note that
total war does output frame rates with a
good amount of variants at the low end
especially this means we won't really be
using the 0.1% metric as much since it
fluctuates past the pass and seems
inconsistent overall we're also only
testing with DirectX 11 because dx12 has
with some issues it's performance just
isn't as good as the x11 and so we're
not testing it for steam at 2500 K
perform at about 92 FPS with 1080p and
high settings for this benchmark
overclocking provides at substantial
gains pushing us up to 114 FPS average
with bolstered frame times the
performance improvement is about 24%
absolutely worth the overclocked for
sure and looking to modern CPUs the 6600
K is capable of operating at 156 average
with the 7600 K at 165 average from the
2500 case of at 7600 K we're seeing a
stock clock rate difference
totaling and resulting in 73 FPS average
or a percentage increase of about 80
percent the final benchmark is GTA 5 and
we had some confusing issues with this
one that arose I still want to include
the benchmark because accurate for every
other CPU except for two of them and
those are something they require some
further investigation maybe someone out
there has encountered this but basically
with the 6600 K and 7600 K we were
seeing some stuttering that was not
occurring on the other CPUs making it
for slightly dragged down averages but
really heavily impacted 0.1% low values
again only on those two CPUs is 66 and
70 600 K when I tweet it out we posted a
tweet asking if anyone has seen this
because we will responded J from Jay's
to sense that he saw something similar
in the past with one of his CPUs so it's
definitely something that's known we've
done everything from reinstalling
Windows to
on GTA drivers XMP changes all that
stuff and the issue persists so this
seems to be less of an ordeal when
dropping XMP when turning off that
profile and going down to something like
21 33 megahertz but it's still present
still we haven't got it fully figured
out yet but the benchmarks are still
good for everything else
those two CPUs have a bit of an asterisk
next to them because of that performance
anomaly right now it looks like some
sort of GTA issue when testing with our
config if anyone's got thoughts on this
post them below
so the charts we're looking at an
average FPS of 101 with the i5 2500 K
with overclocking pushing off to an
impressive 124 FPS average compared to
the i7 2670 it seems to provide the
biggest impact to performance at least
for the most part by 535 70 K operates
about 11 FPS faster than the stock I 5
2500 K and then again the other i5 is
6670 600 K just seems to have some
issues but are definitely at least 123
to 129 fps and the averages we've done
due diligence on these to try and figure
out that issue with those 2 CPUs again
Windows reinstall completely fresh
platform drivers CPU changes XMP changes
over clocks and not over clocks to check
the memory bus or a memory controller
she'd rather lots of things to try but
didn't quite figure those throughout so
that's the way it goes sometimes for
ashes of the singularity and Metro last
light if you want to see those results
check the link for the full article in
the description below as always and that
will contain additional benchmarks and
some further analysis the 2500 K has
held up relatively well for the past 5
years but it's starting to show some
serious age in a few specific game
watchdogs two-for-one post fairly
sizable differences between modern CPUs
on a 2500 K though multi-core seems to
matter more for that particular title
we're also seeing big gains from
overclocking in a lot of games
especially because the 2500 K was so
easy to overclock if you've got one it
might be worth throwing it under a good
cooler maybe an a IO and pushing it for
4.5 gigahertz to the remainder of its
life blender and rendering tasks are
particularly abusive to the I've
2,500 K which is being outpaced nearly
two folds by modern successors it's a
good time to upgrade some of the 2500 K
a CPU has held on really well as of the
2600 K and it's still hanging on but it
is kind of nearing the end of life where
modern GPU is if you're buying one might
get bottlenecks by the i-5 particularly
if you're going for anything above 10 60
and 480 class like the 1070 and 1080 and
whatever Vega may bring so that means it
is now good to look for KB Lake and then
now normally we don't really recommend
waiting for CPU or GPU or really just
component upgrades in general because
unless there's something really specific
you want a lot of the time it's just
waiting for the sake of waiting because
you can wait forever in the computer
hardware world there's always something
new but Zen is very close at this point
it should be launching next month and
that's close enough to wait especially
when you've already have the CPU for
five years or so and also then now
normally if a new Intel CPU were coming
out next month I might suggest not
waiting just because we know their gains
are pretty small on average generally if
you need a system now it's worth buying
zen is a big deal for AMD they haven't
released anything major for several
years now almost since this CPU came out
twenty five hundred K so it's worth
waiting around if you can to see how it
goes we'll revisit the topic when we
review the Rison CPUs for now it's
either a 7600 K or 6600 K if you can
find one for cheaper than the kb lake
alternatives because basically the same
but if they're used or something you can
get a cheaper go for it but a 4690k
might also be worth looking into if you
can find one for cheap on Newegg amazon
or somewhere they're dumping a bunch of
them to make room on the shelves but
that's all I got for you so 2500 K
pretty interesting results especially in
