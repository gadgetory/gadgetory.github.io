Nexus tonight and we are here with a lot
of computer components that not a
surprise given the content of this
channel today we are building a budget
AMD gaming PC quick note before we get
started I'm giving away an anti 1250
liquid cooler it is a dual pump liquid
cooler subscribe to the channel for info
on that and check back for the video
that details the giveaway and how the
process will work if you need a liquid
cooler it's a pretty good way to get a
free one so moving on this is actually
an entry-level overclocking PC if you
want to do a little bit more than gaming
you want to actually pump up those
clocks on the CPU maybe play around with
Ram the GPU a little bit this is the
system that we expect out for that it is
about $700 for all these parts you could
go for Intel in this price range but
you'd be dropping your GPU a little bit
and some of your other components a
little bit and I wanted to have some fun
with overclocking I know a lot of you
are interested in it and of course
graphics are pretty important so we
wanted more money to borrow from the CPU
budget and put into the GPU budget and
that's what we've done here so let me
run you through the parts and in this
guide I'll show you how to overclock
this exact system and we're using an
aftermarket CPU cooler of course to do
that so that's what this guide will
cover I'll also run through game
benchmarks in the end hit links in the
description below for all of the content
and all of the charts for the benchmarks
if you are curious about how this
performs in specific games like
Battlefield 4 and whatever so here's
what we've got the CPU we've got an AMD
athlon x4 760 k now some of you may know
the Athlon line from way back during the
x64 days when they were first starting
this is Andy's new Athlon which is
basically just an APU with no IGP so
they've dropped the graphics chip on the
APU on the richland 80 years to be exact
and we've just got a CPU in there so
it's just a CPU on the die and and
because of his richland that means it's
going to perform a little bit better on
the CPU side than Kaveri dusk very does
better with the GPU we don't want that
we've got a discrete graphics card and
so what we have here for the video card
is an MS
Twin Frozr edition r9 270 you can
actually get a 284 about the same price
now that just dropped it a couple days
ago
that's about 170 to 190 dollars the CPU
is $80 pretty pretty good steel there
for the motherboard we're putting the
CPU and everything else into we've got
an AMD of course 888 XG 45 game
motherboard from MSI and because it is
an 888 X chipset it's actually going to
work with both FM 2 and FM 2 + CP u so
if you wanted to drop it Kaveri if you
in there you can totally do that it's
not going to give you any huge
advantages over 885 X because with
Richland we can't take advantage of
pci-e Gen 3 but that's irrelevant for
these purposes you're not gonna exceed
the bandwidth of Gen 2 anyway so don't
worry about that it will support two
video cards and x8 x8 if you want to do
crossfire or SLI that is an opportunity
there and at overclocked memory up to
2400 megahertz which is a chipset and
platform limitation so not crazy high
but not bad you're not going to need one
1600 anyway for gaming so moving on to
the power supply everything is being
powered by a Rosewill 550 watt PSU it is
a bronze rated PSU this was actually
bundled with the case here and that
bundle deals pretty good I think it's
like 15 or 25 dollars cheaper than
normally if you buy them separately so I
was on Newegg links again below in the
article the case is a thermal take G 41
commander case so that's it's it's just
a cheap mid tower it's a budget case it
has a 120 millimeter fan in the back
120mm front you can easily drop more
bigger fans to in the top and in the
bottom if you want more cooling or need
it for our purposes not so much will be
fine with that
CPU cooler unless your room runs pretty
hot or you're overclocking your GPU as
well so that's the case it has a little
bit of cable management room in the back
I'll show you all that pretty
straightforward stuff not not too crazy
for drives we have technically this
build I'm specking with a one terabyte
Western Digital
drive because that's all you needed 7200
rpm that's what you want for gaming if
you want an SSD you can get like a 240
gigabyte one for 90 bucks right now
crazy good deal I would highly recommend
it for budget purposes we're sticking
with a 7200 rpm one terabyte drive
technically you'll see a green WD are 2
terabyte drive over there as well that's
because I'm building those system for a
very piratical friend shout-out to
optimum so so that's what we've got here
for RAM and the optical drive of course
the most important component Ram is two
sticks of four gigabyte Kingston HyperX
Ram I believe it is their Genesis line
and I have pretty good stuff it's this
clocked at like 1600 or 1866 something
like that and we can very easily
overclock it not too expensive and gets
the job done for gaming and reliable so
then the optical drive standard 24 X
don't even I mean if you're not gonna
use it if you can install Windows with
the USB key do it and forget the optical
drive save that will save you 20 bucks
then we've got the CPU cooler which of
course is going on our $80 overclocked
CPU so this is a fan Tex pH 12 DX or TC
12 D X I think that's what it's called
it's a very user friendly name as you
can notice when the hardware reviewer
can't even remember it it is the TC 12
DX and this chips it's pretty cool ships
in red silver blue and black and I think
it's nickel-plated it uses just normal
paint for the for the actual fins it
won't impact your performance all that
much but it looks pretty damn cool if
you want something red or blue or
whatever so that's what we have there
it's four six millimeter heat pipes
pretty standard stuff direct contact and
yeah I'm just just a CPU cooler right
it's a pretty decent air cooler if you
want air if you want liquid I would not
recommend getting into it unless you're
spending about 80 plus dollars because
any of the cheap liquid coolers are you
gonna perform worse and louder than a
high-end air cooler and those will be
priced the same so those are my thoughts
there now if you're not sure how to
build a computer you haven't done it
before I hit the link in the description
below or I'll pop it up right in front
of me
the video that is a guide on how to
build a computer it's not the same spec
but it's the same exact process so check
that out and that'll help you get the
system together and up and running but
let's jump into this build I'll kind of
speed through building it and then I'll
show you how to overclock the system run
through the game benchmarks and we'll be
done now in terms of the actual build
process for this it's pretty standard
you can check out my other tutorial
video on how to build a gaming computer
if you need help actually assembling
this but in in this specific scenario
the only thing I'd really advise you to
do specially is to route the fan cable
for the rear fan under the video card
before you install it plug it in then at
the bottom of the board and that frees
up your fan slot on the right side of
the board if you want to install an
additional top fan as I've done here for
top intake because the overclock was
pushing it a couple degrees too high so
this cooled the down to a point where I
felt comfortable with it now that we've
got the system built we are ready to
overclock as I mentioned this is a
beginner level overclocking system it's
pretty straightforward what we're gonna
do today nothing too special because I
really would advise you to play around
and read a lot before you start tweaking
the more advanced settings and BIOS so
what we're starting with here today is
just meant to be multiplier control and
then in in the actual OS we'll mess
around with MSI Afterburner to play with
the video card settings so here we've
got MSI's BIOS open this is UEFI bios of
course so it is mouse enable that is
pretty fancy on the graphics run not not
anything like the old blue and white 8
or 16 bit bios we used to have so what
you need to do first is open up this OC
tab on the left you'll start on settings
and there's also OC before you install
your OS you probably want to go to
settings and go through to advanced and
then integrated peripherals and just
make sure you're on HCI mode for the
SATA mode because that's that's what we
want to install it is it should be like
that by default but just out of habit I
always do that so make sure in the top
left that OC Genie is currently off that
is MSI is autumn overclocking feature
you can use it if you
like to get a baseline but we're gonna
play around with this manually so that
we can learn some more click on the OC
tab you'll see the CPU base frequency is
set to 100 megahertz and then if you
look down below adjusted CPU ratio which
is set to auto right now if you look
below that you shouldn't see 3800
megahertz which is 3.8 gigahertz the
stock frequency that the processor you
purchased shifts at if you got the 760 K
so what we're gonna do here is play
around with the multiplier and that's
all that's going on behind the scenes
right now at a 100 megahertz base clock
BC LK with a 2.8 gigahertz total
frequency we're multiplying it by 38 X
right now so if we type in 38 and adjust
CPU ratio you will see that nothing
changes because all we've done is turn
auto off and set it to the setting it
was on already what we can do is
increment that slowly to higher
multipliers and hope that the CPU
remains stable with the higher clock
rate so I normally suggest just jumping
straight to 40 or 41 because that's not
too huge of an overclock so it should
remain stable and it'll get you through
those first steps a little bit easier so
we're gonna jump to 41 because I've
already tested and this is stable at 41
which is 4.1 gigahertz and if you want
to try and step higher you might want to
start running liquid once you hit the
four point two to four point five
gigahertz range because the CPU does run
a little bit hot and it's very hard to
find accurate measurement software
unfortunately so we're at 41 right now
that's 4.1 gigahertz you don't have to
adjust the Northbridge ratio you don't
have to really adjust anything at this
point you don't even need to change
voltage for the CPU because we're not
pushing it that hard but of course if we
started pushing up the frequency a
little bit higher maybe is a 45
multiplier rains and you probably will
need to start changing the voltage to
make sure the CPU remains stable just
check the maximum voltage recommended by
AMD so you don't push it too high and
melt things by the way check out my
overclocking primer video for GPU and
CPU overclock units a bit
more in-depth and this will be this kind
of a crash course so check those if you
want more details on what all these
items and BIOS do because it does get
pretty advanced if you want to get more
extreme with your overclock
so starting out you need to make sure
your memory is configured properly it'll
probably be 1333 or 1600 by default but
the memory that we purchased is actually
a bit more capable than that so this
board has Intel's XMP profiling built
into it so we can say enable XMP and you
can choose profile 1 or profile to
profile 1 will have slightly higher cash
latencies or cast timings but it's it's
faster in the frequency Department it's
1866 megahertz with a 10 cache latency
and profile 2 is 1600 megahertz with a 9
9 9 27 latency so it's a bit faster in
terms of wait and see if it's lower in
frequency
I just using profile 1 right now
honestly this isn't going to have a huge
impact on your gaming performance but
why not boost it above the 1333 or 1600
default right so we'll push it to 1866
with profile 1 and this point we're
pretty much done we've got our basic
overclock dialed in we have our RAM set
to what it should be so we can hit f10
to save and exit and now the system is
going to boot normally into Windows once
you're in Windows you want to download
an MSI Afterburner and that is going to
be used for overclocking the GPU and
also monitoring the GPU temperatures but
before actually tweaking the GPU we need
to make sure that the CPU overclock
we've just set is stable so the best way
to do that is grab Hardware monitor
that's HW monitor and that will let us
monitor the CPU temperatures
unfortunately there's not an accurate
measurement tool for any of these modern
AMD CPUs I don't know why that is
they're all going to measure a lot
hotter than the CPU actually is but
hardware monitor is the most accurate I
found so grab that then grab prime95 it
can be found on the interwebs if you
type in prime95
and I have a guide on using that as well
and our overclocking primer i've already
mentioned so grab product prime95 run a
hardware monitor and then tell prime95
to run l FFTs large FFT
and that's going to really strain the
CPU and not much else so you want to run
that for if you make it to the 15-minute
mark it's probably going to be fairly
stable so I would really start with just
go to 15 minutes make sure it's stable
if you want to try and push the clocks a
little bit more go for it but watch that
Harper monitor temperature the whole
time make sure you're not exceeding
anything dangerous I was sitting at
around 77 C which sounds hot but again
this is not an accurate measurement tool
so 77 C was was what it was measuring at
with the stock installation with an
aftermarket cooler when I overclocked it
was sitting around 83 C so that's about
five to six Celsius warmer not too
terribly much it is quite warm but again
we have measurement issues in terms of
accuracy so not too bad overall to get
60 warmer with that extra couple hundred
megahertz boost to the frequency so as
you're measuring temps just make sure it
stays kind of on the on the safe side
and let it run for 15 minutes at burns
to reboot up the frequency if you really
want to if you feel confident and if you
have a liquid cooler probably and and
then do that until you get crashes or
blue screens don't let it exceed
anything like 90 Celsius 95 Celsius
that's getting the danger zone
especially since t.j.maxx on these AMD
CPUs is technically I believe 75 or 80
Celsius Richland is a bit warmer but
I've said it a thousand times now it all
comes down to measurement tools so so
that's that's the need-to-know
information on CPU overclocking run
prime95 with l FF T's for as long as you
think is reasonable a couple hours
ideally once you have a frequency you're
happy with just to make sure it remains
stable and then jump into msi
afterburner and with afterburner we can
adjust the GPU settings to get a tiny
bit of a GPU overclock you can't
overclock GPUs to the same capacity as
CPUs because they function differently
so the stock setting here in afterburner
is 955 of megahertz for the core clock
we're gonna
just that pretty comfortably to 995 that
is about a 40 megahertz overclock and
and that'll that'll punish us a couple
extra frames if we're lucky depending on
the game and it's not gonna be unstable
so set set that 995 megahertz overclock
you might want to step it up more
gradually than that I stepped it up 20
megahertz at a time so I did two
increments of 20 before I found this to
be stable and safe and then run fur mark
with the burnin 1080p test and run that
let it run its course if it crashes
you've gone too far you need to back off
that throttle a little bit if it doesn't
crash you're good probably leave it
where it is and don't play with it too
much
don't touch the voltage unless you know
what you're doing and the memory clock
is nice to jump up but it's not gonna
really push a whole lot of extra frames
and your performance in gaming but you
can read my full guide on overclocking
for more information on all of that so
what does this gain us well in the real
world I got about a 10 FPS boost in
average fps in battlefield 4 that's a
pretty significant boost that put us
from about 40 FPS to about 50 fps and if
he drops on the battlefield settings
it's the difference between 50 and 60
fps which is very smooth gameplay on a
60 or it's monitored - pretty average
gameplay so that's battlefield in Metro
last light I saw almost no difference in
the average FPS it was a very small
however the 1% low FPS which would be
your lag spikes we call them graphic
spikes that Department was about 5 to 10
FPS better with the overclock so that's
fairly significant that means your
spikes will be much less impacting to
your ability to aim and play the game
and then the Total War series I used as
a CPU benchmark almost no difference
across the board it was pretty flat so
you're not gonna see a lot of difference
there just goes to show that it all
depends on how the
optimized and built so that's everything
he needs to know about the system if you
need help building this post a comments
on the article I don't hit the YouTube
comments too much anymore but post a
comments on the article linked in the
description below all of the parts for
this build are linked in the description
below and let me know if you need help
we will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
