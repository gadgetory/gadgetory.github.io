hardware news recap for the week this
one the biggest item is in rumor status
and it's Andy's semi custom solutions
for the next-gen consoles
finally getting some specifications
leaked out Roman also responded to our
overclocking challenge he's a couple of
months late but he did need to wait for
Asus to help him so that's
understandable IDC and Gartner reporting
that Intel CPU shortages are affecting
sales obviously but the interesting part
is that both of them align and their
views which is rare and then a couple of
other things like steams Hardware survey
from March of 2019 has given us some
more stats on market share following up
on our sales volume post for Intel and
AMD before that this video is brought to
you by the gigabyte z 390 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful Z 390 VRMs for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th gen
Intel CPUs the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a real
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated our DV illumination learn
more at the link below so the quick GN
news item for this one we have the mod
mats finally coming back in so we just
got the shipping information and they're
on the way which means if you have
orders in they'll be shipping out soon
and if you don't have an order and you
should get one in so that you can get a
mod mat shipped out to you as soon as
they arrive which will be in the next
probably 10 or so days at this point so
medium and large will be back in stock
shortly on store documents nexus net if
you would like to pick one up let's
start with the AMD news item so this one
is expansion on speculation that AMD is
working on the next SOC set to power
next-generation consoles from Microsoft
and Sony while not confirmed by AMD
rumors suggest that the chip will take
the form of a semi custom apu named
Gonzalo a twitter user by the name of t
um underscore api sak alleges that there
is now a qualification sample in
existence and it was spotted in the 3d
mark database with a code name of its
really long zg 167 0 to a e8 JB to
underscore
32 slash 10/18 underscore 13
eight which of course we all know is the
APU for these consoles and assuming that
this leak is accurate and it looks like
it maybe it would indicate that AMD is
late in the development process nearing
completion and that volume production
could be near more interesting is how
much of the qualification sample has
changed from the rumored engineering
sample spotted back in January it's
looking like an increased 1.6 gigahertz
base clock revised stepping going from a
2 to B 2 and a different version of Navi
10 light running at 1.8 gigahertz
suggested by the new pci ID 13 e9 all of
this would align with the conjecture
that AMD has made considerable progress
on the APU and is nearing the production
stage but of course take with salt as
prescribed though we are nearing the
point where we should start seeing real
specs officially confirmed next one is
Roman der Bower finally responding to
our overclocking challenge so Roman
overclocked to I think it was 20 ATT
eyes using some voltage mods and was
able to take the new two card high score
in the 3d mark Hall of Fame so he's got
a video up you should watch it if you
haven't and it should get things pretty
interesting again because at some point
we'll respond it's just a matter of I
guess what equipment were using at this
point or if we're waiting for anything
like certain new video cards so he went
to some event I think an asus event in
Russia and set up a system there did the
benchmarks he's got a video on it and
it's pretty cool you should check it out
but we will be responding at some point
in the future so keep an eye out for
lives two announcements from us as we
continue to try and brute force their
Bower into a losing position by having
more expensive parts than him because
that's the only way it happens IDC and
Gartner both reporting that Intel has a
CPU shortage issue we've been talking
about this for a long time that we just
published in the last week our Intel and
AMD sales volume roundup for our viewers
but that extends past our viewership -
in some ways so the interesting bit here
is that while these statistics and
numbers tend to be different between
Gartner and IDC for their reports the
one thing that they
both agree on is Intel's contribution to
declining PC shipments in first quarter
of 2019 which is something that
Microsoft also indirectly accused Intel
of basically saying Windows 10 had lower
adoption than expected because one of
their major partners couldn't supply
enough chips to the market which is
obviously Intel so both firms agree that
Intel's continued CPU shortages affected
the global PC market particularly the
low-end market where Intel has more or
less abandoned some of the Pentium chips
and products along those lines in favor
of saving their fab space for higher and
higher aspe products many manufacturers
especially those not among the big three
so that B Dell HP Lenovo were forced to
look elsewhere for CPUs including an D
in some cases for the first time in a
long time
Gartner senior principal analyst Miss
Kitagawa of the following the supply
constraints affected the vendor
competitive landscape as leading vendors
had better allocation of chips and also
began sourcing alternative CPUs from AMD
the top three vendors worldwide we're
still able to increase shipments despite
the supply constraint by focusing on
their high-end products and taking share
from small vendors that struggled to
secure CPUs
moreover the constraints resulted in the
top vendors shifting their products
makes to the high-end segment in order
to deal with these constraints which
along with favorable component price
trends should boost profit margins so
the system integrators and OMS that are
shifting as the quote says some of their
focus toward the high end which helps
prop up the margins and make up for
Intel's inability to meet demand at
present IDC reiterated that more PC
makers are turning into an v4 solution
so we've got two large sources for that
rather than waiting on Intel and that
the vendors have been more focused on
commercial and business consumers for
their pre-built systems rather than
looking at the average end-user and the
quote from them is furthermore more PC
brands turned to AMD chips all this
combined with firms rounding the last
corner on its Windows 10 migration
deployments led to a shift in the market
for traditional pcs toward more
commercial and premium product and IDC
also
said that quote Intel CPU shortages
continued to pose a production
bottleneck for PC makers and then
further cited that all of this is also
in addition to consumer interest on a
downtrend for new PCs is something we've
heard for a long time now
so the enthusiasts market is a bit of a
bubble where there's still a high volume
of purchasing relative to previous years
whereas pre-built desktops are for
end-users not for gamers are on a
continual downtrend IDC and Gartner both
differ and how they interpret the market
data and they have different numbers as
well and they have different opinions on
the leading PC makers so the fact that
they align in these things Intel CPU
shortage is affecting the market as a
whole is a important point to note and
we'll have a link to additional coverage
on that there the IDC and the Gartner
reports and our show notes linked in the
description below steam has released its
hardware survey for March of 2019 market
sure hasn't changed much year-over-year
despite our recent sales volume results
showing GM's viewers shifting buy and
habits significantly the difference here
is that because with the market that's
much larger than our small enthusiast
segment it takes a long time for the
ships to turn Intel and NVIDIA jointly
hold almost all of the notebook market
and the pre-built desktop market at
least four years past meaning that and
these inroads to the DIY enthusiast
space will be obscured by this data and
Andy still has a very long way to go
despite recent positive news like the
previous story in steam survey AMD holds
about eighteen point one percent market
share
Intel's 81 point nine percent market
share for gaming CPUs with 56 percent of
users still on quad-core CPUs video card
usage and market share is always
awkwardly measured in valve survey as it
includes Intel I GPS as part of the GPU
measurement although we wouldn't
traditionally really count those either
way counting Intel steam shows Nvidia at
75% AMD had about 15% and Intel at about
10% just meaning that there's an Intel
AGP in that amount of systems DirectX 12
is gaining popularity in a more
noteworthy way progressing from 50
percent to about 65 percent market share
over the past year if you remember
specter and meltdown there's still more
to that
storia but now there's a new one called
spoiler this has been spoiled for a
little while at this point but intel
finally responded to it so Intel gave
the spoiler exploit a low risk advisory
and this is following the exploit being
dropped into Intel's lap it is somewhat
unique it only affects Intel CPUs it
does not affect arm it does not affect
Andy at present and this is because of a
proprietary memory subsystem that Intel
uses on its products not used on the
others which includes a memory order
buffer that spoiler is able to directly
target previous side-channel attacks
include the out of order execution
attacks and spectrum meltdown Spectre
which affects CPUs for the last couple
of more than a decade was one of the
bigger ones but spoiler is the recent
ones of spoilery leverages speculative
execution as well and the inherent
weakness in Intel's memory subsystem to
leak critical information about page
mappings physical address mappings and
it can also be used to bolster other
known memory attacks like row hammer or
other side channel attacks even though
spoiler abuses speculative execution it
affects an entirely different area of
the CPU thus current specter and
meltdown mitigations aren't applicable
and don't work for this one what's more
is researchers noted that Intel likely
won't be able to deliver a micro code
patch due to the complexity of the
memory subsystem at least not without a
massive performance degradation in
response Intel officially issued a
security advisory on its site and has
given spoiler a CVE
identifier in the advisory Intel
assigned spoiler a cbss base score of
three point eight out of ten which
indicates a low security risk
Intel doesn't say much else about
spoiler other than it would require an
authenticated user and local access to
Hardware which is likely why it doesn't
appear overly concerned with the flaw
spoiler is another testament that CPUs
need Hardware mitigation for security
threats at this point involving the
overhaul of to some extent the actual
design of the architecture other
research papers have noted previously
that modern CPU design has D prioritized
security in the name of performance and
we're starting to see the consequences
of such designs quick one on Nvidia here
we talked about RT X or DX r so
for coming to some of the 10 series
cards previously when we noted that
everything above a 1063 gigabyte would
support DXR on the new drivers those
drivers are finally out so if you've
wanted them and you wanted to try DXR on
a Pascale 10 Series card you can now do
so games have to support this as well
but if you wanted to try it out and
videos got a couple of performance
numbers they're really more or less what
you would expect this instance of DX are
on GTX sort of serves two to three
purposes and one of them is it's a try
before you buy
so for owners of Pascal they can now see
what DXR r-tx features might look like
even if they don't get a frame rate
that's particularly desirable these are
can still see the end result and that
may from a sales standpoint convinced
them their hardware's out-of-date they
need to upgrade so that's potentially
one one up side from Nvidia to viewpoint
or if you're a user and you do want to
see what RT X and DX are really look
like without just looking at YouTube
videos then you could now try that
separately this is also a way for Nvidia
to sort of prove the point that from
from Nvidia's viewpoint look you need
taurine to actually do this stuff
properly and if you don't believe us go
ahead and try it will give you the
ability to on Pascal so that's that's
point number two point number three is
that although may be inadvisable this
does technically widen the pool of
developers and make it a bit easier for
RT X and DX are adoption to happen as
most of the market that is on modern
hardware may still be on Pascal 10
Series card since 20s not that old yet
so it does widen that user base even if
it's not a particularly good piece of
hardware for ray tracing it's still
doable at least on some of them like the
1080i so they've got some numbers on
that if you're really curious about it
but not too much to look at up next
Intel obtain memory h10 SSDs Intel
announced its new opt in memory age ten
drives will be coming to the laptop
market later this year the new octane
drives combine obtain memory and qlc
NAND and an m2 form factor flash and
octane are two distinct types of storage
and as such the new drives will use two
separate controllers for each the new
octane h10 drives will present
themselves to the operating system as
two separate PCIe drives which will
require motherboard supporting PCIe
bifurcation from there the drives are
combined using Intel's at rapid storage
technology which will then use the
octane memory as something of a cache
system for frequently accessed data
Intel has some lofty claims for the H 10
SSD stating that they will launch games
60% faster to check faster than what
you'll need to check the slide appendix
for each of these claims they will
apparently load documents two times
faster for what that's worth
an open multimedia files up to 90
percent faster which could be useful for
the large files and the 810 drives
aren't being sold to the consumer just
yet
not exactly rather they're coming from
OMS and new laptops slated for second
quarter of 2019 however as Tom's
Hardware notes support for the DIY
market is coming in the near future
unlocking Lee Adobe is ending shockwave
support its discontinued so adobe has
officially taken shockwave off of life
support and it has declared the plugin
officially end-of-life to no one's
surprise
honestly we thought it was already dead
but shockwave was first deployed in 95
for rich media format files and
interactive content for websites and CD
ROMs however with the migration of
technology such as html5 WebGL shockwave
was supplanted and has been largely
unused except for perhaps the small
local business website down the street
from me that hasn't updated since the
mid-90s no one uses CD ROMs anymore
anyway so shockwave going away really
not not too big of a shock and Adobe
plans to kill off flash in 2020 so
that'll be the next big death from
Adobe's product line adobe has taken
down the page for shockwave so if you
want to get it the version number you
need to look up is twelve point three
point five point two oh five that's the
last iteration of the software the last
news item is the 9990 X II and its price
which is $2,800 so if you've found
yourself with an extra three grand or so
and you couldn't think of how to spend
it the 9990 XE which was a an auction
only processor is now available via
retail through K skin and this isn't
some
we necessarily expected because it it
was such a limited auction that there
were there were system integrators who
only got one like Puget systems some
iBUYPOWER they both bought one one CPU
the companies that typically buy them on
the order of hundreds or potentially
thousands depending on the size of the
company they're buying one of them so
this thing is available via retail now
caseking has it's the German large site
they work with OSI UK as well but if you
wanted to import it to the US or
elsewhere you could case Cana has system
builds available aimed at streaming that
used the 9990 XE for the primary system
and a 9600 K for the secondary system
the system also uses a 28 e TI and a cos
Omega motherboard and an elgato for K 60
Pro capture card and the Kane mod seek
seek a PC 843 as it's called will cost
twelve thousand nine hundred ninety nine
point nine zero euros in addition to
taxes and shipping I guess if you wanted
it you could get it but very small
market for that even the sis we're a
small market for that one so that's it
for this video as always subscribe for
more you get a store documents nexus net
if you want to get on back order for our
medium or large mod mats which are
coming in in the next ten days or so and
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
