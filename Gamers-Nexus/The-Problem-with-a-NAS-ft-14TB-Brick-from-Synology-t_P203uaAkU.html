with 20 terabytes of inaccessible data
on it it's part of the problem with
network-attached storage is if something
goes wrong you can't really service it
it's not like if we did a DIY server
which is by the way what we're doing
next and we have here a problem with
either the power supply or the
motherboard or the power board or some
proprietary component inside of this
sign Allah GDS 15 15 plus it's
apparently a very common issue and if
you push the power button doesn't come
on anymore so today we're gonna try and
troubleshoot this and see what the heck
is going on and if there's a good way to
fix it before that this video is brought
to you by thermal takes view 37 case the
vo 37 focuses on highlighting custom PC
builds with its full panoramic window
and tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
quick back story on this so it's a 20
terabyte raid which means 14 terabytes
is accessible and usable by us we have
all of our b-roll on here compressed and
uncompressed we have our finished files
on here that get uploaded to YouTube we
have our product designs our logos our
software basically everything except for
a really critical business tax document
stuff like that and we've got a remote
backup through a backup service that has
some of that stuff backed up about well
most of the finished files most a really
important stuff is there but there's
some stuff on here that we need like
brand-new product files we've been
working on things that we haven't backed
up yet because they're like new this
week and that will be addressed later
working on a better backup solution so
anyway this is some sign ology nass it's
a really common point of failure for
this particular model and other models
made in this year to not turn on anymore
which is great it's the best thing to
deal with in a business is to just
randomly have all your operations grind
to a halt for seemingly no good reason
and another problem with this series of
Nass is not just the power delivery
randomly dying but also the Intel
processor that's in here it's some atom
or something it's got some security
vulnerabilities and then it also has its
own issue of randomly died so I was kind
of hoping that we got one of the updated
ones thinking well we're a media outlet
they should send us a good one but nope
they didn't cherry-pick it so we got
what any customer would get which is a
dead mass and we I've already purchased
a replacement unfortunately the problem
with some of this is that in order to
migrate the raid and not lose all the
data I did have to buy another sign
ology and ask what our next move is
going to be a custom server and it's
something we're working on for a couple
of months from now I built servers for
our web server in the past it's not a
big deal but we should just do that at
this point because the thing is with
this it doesn't work and I can't really
do much about it because all proprietary
parts in the most part so yes I can buy
a new power supply for the unit on eBay
it'll get here in three or four weeks
from China I can buy maybe a motherboard
for it but it's unlikely and motherboard
failures are pretty common and a lot of
them are already bought so that leaves
us with a question of what the hell do
we do to get our data that's not backed
up yet off of this thing safely and make
sure that we can continue to operate so
again the problem is with these things
they are not user serviceable and if I
build my own damn - which I'm capable of
but decided not to
cuz this seems like one of those you
plug it in and just works types of type
of thing and it did just work for a
couple of years but when it didn't just
work anymore it was potentially a
catastrophic failure that cost the
business a lot of money a lot of files
and stuff that we can't really get back
or recreate so that's the problem with
it if this happened on my own server I
built and I knew it's a motherboard or a
CPU or a power supply I have shelves of
those components and I can swap it out
in 15 minutes and be done whereas this
might take me weeks to get a power
supply I might never be able to get a
motherboard or it won't be
of all in terms of price so let me show
you a couple of things here first of all
will save everyone some time you can
unlock these drives which the lock is
really just kind of stupid anyway but
you can unlock the drives and pull them
out and in doing so it will sometimes
help to completely reset everything so
this is a troubleshooting stuff I
already did basically you pull every
drive out label them so let you know
what order they go back in what slot so
you can recover the raid but if you have
this problem you pull all the drives out
first let it sit leave it alone unplug
the power and see if it turns back on
hopefully does and if it doesn't turn
back on that should that's pretty close
to resetting the CMOS like in terms of
what it does for recovery it doesn't
turn back on here's a thing I learn in
the past few days you open this thing up
that's ATX power in fact actually
completely unintentional plugging of our
mod mat which I'm using right now so
let's take a look at this this is a very
well planned by accident
what we have here let's take a look at a
green because there's only really one of
them so green and ground right here
that's gonna be the fourth pin over on
its row and it's got a black on either
side and a blue over here and then an
orange on the end so this is our mod
pack you go to store document access net
to pick it up if you want it it's a
great modding and building service but
it also has pin out diagrams like this
so let's look over at the pin out now so
I said there's a Dan orange blue black
green orange blue black green black
black black and then should be blank
yep blank red red red and then it should
be black yep so this is actually the
same pin out as an ATX 24-pin power plug
which means we can actually just plug in
a computer power supply and see if this
is a power supply problem and start
troubleshooting from there these get
these are super tightly crammed in there
so I use a flathead to just pry it out
so we can unplug that and now what we're
going to do is a simple test with a
power supply tester so here's one of
those that I happen to already have
fortunately so we
plug this in right here okay so it's got
power so this is a power supply tester
it's got all the different voltages on
the front of it so there's like twelve
five so forth and one of our 12 volt
rails over here is not reporting 12
volts the LDL indicator that you're
seeing on this 12 volt line really just
means if there's no EPS 12 volt cable
connected so this actually seems like it
passes the test we're still not really
sure what the problem is the problem
further is that the hard drive power is
a special connector so hard drive power
is in here a whole bunch of red 5 volt
whole bunch of yellow 12 volt bunch of
black foreground that is not a standard
power supply connector so a few
solutions here one is if this is a power
supply problem and if this cable is also
bad or whatever is the power delivery in
general is bad I could solder molex or
SATA connectors to these solder the red
yellow and black wires together and it
would work just take a day because it's
a lot of cables or I can order a
replacement $350 to replace this stupid
power supply which is like under 300
Watts 250 watt custom power supply 350
bucks ships from China won't get here
for 4 weeks that's on the in except
unacceptable so that leaves us with a
troubleshooting option which is going to
be let's plug in a computer ATX power
supply so I pulled this one out that we
weren't using and all that happens here
is I plug in this 24 pin which has the
same I'm it's all black out cables
unfortunately but same exact pin out as
you saw in our mod mat which is on here
so it's safe so we can plug this in the
motherboard and I'll just go ahead and
plug again that mod mat the pin out
diagrams helped us significantly for
PCIe fans and for 24 pin now so if you
do want to grab it the next round will
be here within I think it should be
shipping to us already actually yes it
is shipping to us already so that means
it'll be going out to you guys within
about a week or so
filming this so anyway plugged in what
we're not gonna do is plug in anything
down here except for this power supply
so this one still needs to get power and
I don't know if this 24-pin needs to be
jumped I don't know if it will even do
anything but we're just gonna go ahead
and plug in a jumper cable anyway
because why not and we're gonna leave
these hard drive cables plugged in so
now the unit needs power and the EVGA
power supply needs power so let me plug
those in okay so plugging everything in
and now in theory all I have to do is
flip the switch on the EVGA power supply
and push the button on here is it on yes
so you can see that blue light blinking
now so our Nass has gone from being
completely 100% unresponsive on the sine
Allah GDS 15 15 plus doesn't work 20
terabytes minus the provisioning space
but or the rounding space call it 14
terabytes 14 terabytes potentially gone
again we have some of it backed up not
that stupid but it's not not everything
is some of the b-roll for example we
don't need it it's not desperate need
its back it up but we didn't have it
backed up and I want it so either way
it's several terabytes of data some of
it more expensive to lose than others
and we're able to access it now and in
order to get the drives to kick on I
just have to plug in an Ethernet cable
so they're not on if we plug in let's
just plug that in just to kind of prove
a point here we got the power on beep
and we have green status LED we have al
an LED on everything appears to be
working
oh not sure if it's a dead power supply
or dead power delivery or bad
motherboard or bad power board or
whatever but it's working now and
basically the problem here boils down to
something that is not necessarily easy
to fix this is okay it's not a difficult
fix but clearly we can't just operate we
could but you don't really want to
operate with just an external power
Slyke ATX power supply sitting outside
your Nass because I don't know how
trustworthy I don't know
what other kinds of problems that could
introduce the the power is no longer
coming from the same source so we're
splitting power from one power supply
for the hard drives and this power
supply is clearly already there
defective or something's wrong with the
24-pin specifically and another power
supply for the rest so not really
something you want to trust your
business with and at this point we have
like I said most that's backed up I can
pull everything else off now that I want
now that it's bootable and then start
getting this thing out the door and we
have to buy another sign ology box just
to migrate the raid I'm going to
download it locally first or safety all
that stuff don't don't worry about us in
terms of making sure the data safe
because I will it'll be fine but this is
a problem that I've always had with
NASA's and now I think our next step is
going to be building a server which I
want us to do this for a while
we built our web server it's all Linux
and everything not a big deal that for
us to do just kind of waiting on the
Silverstone cs3 81 I think that we
showed you at Computex I really want to
use that case for our server so once we
have our own server the motherboard dies
power supply dies whatever we've got a
whole shelf of them and we're gonna be a
bit safer with the raids and stuff like
that still gonna have an ass it'll still
do local file storage for test data for
backups we have remote backups it all be
and is presently safe in terms of data
but I wanted to show you the
troubleshooting steps here so if you run
into this problem with one of these
types of boxes or another one
fortunately it's not too difficult to
fix this particular problem but that's
if you have this specific problem the
greater issue still lies that all this
stuff is semi proprietary and not
necessarily easy to get your hands on
especially for an older unit where it's
just not on eBay anymore or something
like that and none of its a permanent
fix anyway so that is the NASS problem
we have that almost cost us a lot of
data and a lot of money but we're good
now and learn from it obviously and
we'll be moving to a better solution in
the future though I did still have to
spend like $1200 unexpectedly on a
replacement Nash because
was not able to send one out on
emergency notice which is fine we don't
really talk with them too much anyway so
that's understandable but it was a big
unexpected expense and once this is done
with we'll never have to deal with it
again fortunately so that's it for this
one as always he could have stored out
gamers access dotnet to pick up the mod
map that we showed at this video it was
an awesome very organic plug for that
one I'm pretty happy with it actually
most at almost that Linus levels of
plugging stuff or we go to
