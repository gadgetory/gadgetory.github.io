X data center obtain Drive it served as
a primer to 3d crosspoint technology the
architecture jointly created by Intel
and micron intel's deployment of this
architectures house under the octane
name while microns will be quantex in an
article we published a few days ago we
revealed that Intel has plans for octane
as a consumer targeted device for
release on April 24th of this year
that's a big change from the $1500 data
center drive we previously looked at
we're back to discuss the potential
challenges that octane memory faces its
target market and messaging that needs
to get across on Intel's part before we
get into that this coverage is brought
to you by EVGA 1080p IFT w3 video card
with the new icx thermistor technology
and if you are curious about that card
you can learn more at the link in the
description below the basics of 3d
crosspoint don't change your intel
octane memory is still using cross
points and the same architecture
underlined as a DCP 4100 X the
difference is in the implementation with
octane memory Intel's looking at more of
a consumer focus whereas the P 4800 X
was data center focused although you
could technically put it in a consumer
system if you wanted to the thing here
is that Intel is still attempting to
fill its unique gap between memory and
storage solutions and is trying to do so
by offering a low latency high endurance
type of memory that effectively serves
as they drive cache and you would use
something like rst to enable it as a
caching device this is a story that
we've all heard before many of you may
remember the earlier SSDs that were too
small to really use as a proper boot
drive we're being used as cache drives
that idea while interesting did largely
fail and was replaced by proper larger
sized SSDs because it just made a lot
more sense in terms of complexity price
usability all that stuff as they became
more popular that's what changed the
price of SSDs fell and mostly eliminated
the need for any type of caching
solution today Intel is trying to bring
back a type of cache though it is a lot
lower latency it is theoretically higher
endurance
and there are all kinds of claims
they've made that make it look pretty
good it's just a matter of is there a
use case for this Intel obtain memory
technology so it's a story we've heard
and for most of our audience it seems
that solid-state drives
plus hard drives are sort of the primary
use case where you're buying likely one
of each and using the SSD of the primary
drive with your favorite applications on
it the hard drive as archival storage or
game storage or whatever that seems to
be about the main use case Intel is
looking at targeting more of a hard
drive only use case for the octane
memory implantation something we'll talk
about here and in some regard this is
reminiscent of those earlier cache
drives and of solid-state hard drives or
SSH DS where they had a bit of SSD on
there and a bit of hard drive on there
neither has been particularly widely
accepted by the market so Intel's got a
long road ahead for octane memory the
question is where this technology has
used cases and if it fills a market gap
that is already unserviceable 'ti octane
memory is fitted on an m2 form factors
stick and although several generations
of Intel platforms host m2 sockets only
KB Lake will officially support octane
memory and the rst update Intel notes
that this is for validation reasons
though the technology is mostly software
driven and just needs an m2 slot on the
hardware side there's nothing special in
KB Lake that skylight does not also
possess with regard to opt in memory
support on the hardware level
aside from additional testing and
validation done on KB Lake that probably
for time reasons wasn't done on skylake
or older platforms the m2 memory stick
acts as something of a front loader for
the system drives Intel markets this as
a $44 stick as targeted at hard drive
users rather than SSD users and thus
only presented significant data in a
hard drive versus opt in cast hard drive
use cases and we have plans to perform
SSD cache use case testing as well to
determine if octane can offer use for
SSD plus hard drive configurations as
most of our viewers and readers are
likely running either way when pre
buffering the hard drives the
performance gains are tremendous so it's
a technology worth looking at opt in
memory can be configured through rst as
a 16 gigabyte or 32
front buffer to primary storage and
Intel says that the device will quote
learn user behavior to determine which
files get cached on the stick windows
files will make up a lot of the file
composition on the stick with frequently
accessed applications art files or games
taking the rest in some brief testing we
performed at the press event we saw
blender and photo editing applications
like again reduce their launch times
from roughly eight and a half seconds to
roughly four seconds after multiple test
passes were averaged the first test
passed with a hard drive made it look a
bit worse but it did improve over time
though nowhere near the extent that
octane improved as it learns the
application will not be publishing any
hard data until we can further validate
in our review as this was a limited run
test in Intel's facility but it has some
promise despite being called memory
Intel octane memory is actually a
non-volatile solution so this is good
for a few reasons one as we discussed in
the data center coverage the idea of
octane and 3d crosspoint is to provide a
higher capacity lower cost somewhat
partner to ram as opposed to an SSD
which is still significantly worse in
Layton sees compared to RAM but filling
somewhere of a middle market so that
means that middle devices always have a
weird challenge just like we saw with
SSH DS and cache drives where they might
not see market adoption in some segments
this one octane storage looks like it's
got a pretty serious future potentially
in data center enterprise things like
that octane memory is the consumer
targeted alternative and that's the
front buffer and then there's also
octane storage eventually for consumer
that we don't have any details on it yet
now as far as what Intel is advertising
because we haven't tested ourselves yet
so we're going off of their numbers for
now and then we'll test and check back
for those results Intel claims a 2x
increase in overall responsiveness that
is their word for basically meaning how
Windows fields so if for Intel slides
and for the purposes of this discussion
when they say responsiveness what they
mean is sort of what the user
experiences when they're launching
things like applications or Windows
Explorer things like that and the point
here that they were making is that for
consumers who are not enthusiast
audiences
like us or like you all for the
consumers who are less informed
responsiveness on Windows with a hard
drive doesn't feel great and there is
merit to that that's the discussion we
had when solid-state drives became a
thing
so there's merit to that discussion now
as far as measuring it we'll do that in
our own testing if it's even possible
but other claims that were made were 4.1
times faster media project launches so
that would be things like large blender
files or large project files and CAD
stuff like that and in some respect you
can think of the Radeon SSD which has
that really large solid-state cache on
the video card it's kind of comparable
to that in ways where if you're
accessing a huge CAD file regularly it
might get stored in this opt in memory
because it's non-volatile it'll stay
there and then every time you access it
hopefully it should be faster up to an
extent where it's not possible to
continue accelerating it beyond that
point so all the tests that they showed
us and the claims they made forthwith
with one exception I believe were versus
a hard drive a single Drive solution
spinning disk not versus solid-state
drives
so obviously the reason you do that is
because if you're Intel and you say well
octane front-loading an SSD or whatever
shows some improvement but nothing like
4.1 X which is a pretty large number so
we're not going to show we're going to
show the less favorable or less
interesting or less sensational scenario
that you would get with a hard drive
that's how I read the situation so
unfortunately we don't know how or if
opt in memory helps in a significant way
with the solid-state drive plus hard
drive solution that most of us are
likely running but front-loading hard
drives it looks pretty good they also
showed some other tests with different
applications Windows boot time stuff
like that power draw should be about the
same as an SSD of similar deployment and
spec so power draw is not a big deal
there and shouldn't impact laptop users
too much as for support immediately
until notes that 130 plus motherboards
will officially support octane at launch
including asu's EVGA gigabyte MSI
as rock and then other vendors will
support following launch and that would
include system integrators power saira
power all the usual suspects in that
department
messaging is Intel's biggest challenge
with octane memory for enthusiasts we've
been told before that front-loading your
drive will speed it up but it's never
really been quite worth the effort
obtain memory completely react acts at a
hardware level though is not too
different to the end-user in terms of
what it's actually doing you keep in
mind too that octane memory is just one
of several implementations there will
again likely be AIC octane storage
devices at some point this year or next
that tends to what happens with these
things those might be more interesting
but we'll see anyway for messaging
challenges Intel informed us that octane
memory is it more to help users who feel
Windows is too slow and it's normally
because the hard drive is the weak link
not the OS itself so we then asked Intel
the obvious question this seems like a
problem that already has a solution
those would be SSDs so why do you feel
obtain is different what makes it seem
like this technology is going to succeed
in a different capacity or better
capacity than solid-state drives have
Intel's main argument here was very non
enthusiast focused so they were looking
at audiences like the person who walks
into Best Buy or other local retail
chain and purchases a complete system
for example the $500 Dell box that's
sitting at Best Buy next to a $500 HP
box these two devices have one thing in
common they probably have hard drives in
them and the consumer is likely buying
it because it is $500 and at the store
if they're not informed and they sit
there and they use one then they use the
other then they use a $2,000 system from
I buy or cyber or whoever they all feel
the same in terms of Windows usability
there is no applications no bloat loaded
on these things they're in the best
light so they probably feel the same the
user who is uninformed therefore buys a
$500 box now that argument is valid in
some ways anyway and Intel is basically
saying look we're going to take those
boxes put off a memory in it it'll be a
$44 retail stick we have no idea what
the market will be for the sis probably
not a whole lot so $44 for
stick and it will perform a whole lot
better okay so that's the argue is but
SSDs exist so what else what else can
you give me if I can still spend 80
bucks and put it pretty damn good SSD in
there without much markup from these at
sighs why is this that much better when
it's not that much cheaper their answer
was well SSDs are hard to use so that
might be laughable to us I think
actually probably is a bit laughable but
the thing is again with that non
enthusiasts audience they're basically
looking at as this user doesn't know
what an SSD is doesn't know where to put
their files doesn't know that putting
stuff on the SSD with limited capacity
should really be reserved for special
types of files that are accessed
frequently are really critical to
operation whatever
so they're saying opt in memory solves
this because you only see one device the
hard drive and then op same memory and
rst work out the rest on its own they
figure out what's what the user needs
okay so that's that's the argument now
the thing is even if we follow that
argument and ignore the whole
enthusiasts market just look at the
consumer market the first thing that
comes to mind is the difference between
Microsoft Windows and Apple's arises is
that Microsoft Windows runs on an open
ecosystem Dell HP CyberPower ibuypower
main gear all of them they all have
their own initiatives to build systems
to aspect that they like that they think
competes they're not restricted by a
company like Apple where Apple says you
know what we want an SSD in this entire
product line you don't get anything else
so that means what happens of course is
there's a race to the bottom Dell and HP
might have two boxes on the shelf
HP's $544 got Intel obtain memory Dells
$500 the end user is still going to buy
the $500 box if the argument to begin
with was they buy the cheapest box on
the shelf so until it's got a problem
there now MDF can certainly help solve
that and pushing the manufacturers and
the S eyes and integrators to use off
paying for those low-end devices that
can do
a whole lot of good depending on how
much they're willing to spend on
marketing and MDF for these eyes so
there's potential there now ultimately
we're seeing a race to the bottom no
matter what that doesn't mean I obtained
useless obtain certainly looks very
promising based on the testing we've
done versus hard drives at the Intel
event lot of caveats there and
requirements but it looks promising it's
just a matter of messaging that is Intel
salute biggest challenge it's not the
technology which seems good it's the how
do we explain this to people who want to
know what it is people like us and how
do we make sure the people who are
buying in bulk are still not just going
for the cheapest thing on the shelf so
there's a lot of testing to do here the
biggest one is going to be if we use opt
in with a traditional SSD how much does
it help us because the latencies are
still a lot lower than traditional SSDs
so that's promising depending on what
you're doing and we'll have to test that
other than that it's it's really just a
matter of seeing what happens we should
be getting samples to test will be
releasing hopefully reviews by launch I
think that was April 24th so launching
April 24th pre-orders are up now don't
preorder it just wait and see what
people say about it because it may or
may not make you sense for your use case
as an enthusiast we'll have to see if
you're using a hard drive it sounds good
but again if you know how to use a
solid-state drive it's kind of like
should you just buy a solid-state drive
instead for 80 to 90 dollars and just
use that so we'll find out for you we'll
let you know if front buffering front
loading whatever helps out with those
use cases or not for now links in the
description below for more information
we have an article on this from a few
days ago we have an article on the DCP
4800 X along with a video that explains
the architecture a bit more then we have
an architecture piece on 3d crosspoint
which is Intel micron co-developed so
you can learn more in all of those links
