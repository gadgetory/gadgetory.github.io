overclock and and the our X 480 this is
the new video card uses new overclocking
software called wot man in the future
there will be aftermarket software like
afterburner and things like that what we
have in here is a custom our X 480 we
have a three part series showing how we
made this it is liquid cooled it will
overclock better then this thing does
but not that much better and the process
is basically the same so we're going to
show you how to do it on this before
getting to the tutorial this coverage is
brought to you by Origin PC and a new
origin Kronos gaming PC with the RX 480
is customizable upgradeable and ready
for VR so for overclocking there's a few
things we need to know there's the tools
that you need and then the settings that
you control the tools you need or should
have include gpu-z that's free you can
get it on techpowerup
you should also have something like 3d
mark or a video game that provides a
good amount of load and then you need
the an AMD software so that's Andy
Radeon settings we news wot man and
other than that a notepad file or a
spreadsheet and I'll show you why in a
moment I would recommend not using firm
our core combustor or anything similar
some synthetic applications generate a
load that very specifically targets one
part of the card maybe tessellation and
those things that will not provoke a
failure in the same sense that game will
so you might get a higher overclock with
fir mark you start playing The Witcher
suddenly your overclocks not actually
stable anymore that's why so let's look
at this thing we've got the custom card
in here as I said I have gpu-z open and
I've got this 3d mark in the background
this is what I recommend I think there's
a free version stress test is what we're
going to use up here and that will run
on loop and then wot man is over here
you get the white man by right-clicking
the desktop go to in the Radeon settings
and once your an AMD Radeon settings
click gaming global settings global wot
man that's where we are so here's our
overclock we have applied now the
settings you will be modifying in this
overclock include the core frequency
which starts us at around 12 66
megahertz the core voltage or V core
and we've also got memory frequency
memory voltage and then there's the fan
rpm for the blower fan or your AIB
partner carb fans and finally the power
percent targets frequency is the
frequency the clock operates at that's
what largely determines your gaming
performance voltage is what basically
determines the stability of your core
and you'll want to increase that as the
frequency increases and becomes less
stable memory frequency is how fast the
memory runs gddr5 in this case power
percent target that's how much extra
board power we're providing over
reference so if you offset by 50 percent
you're running out 150 percent power
you're drawn a lot more wattage it's not
great for the GPU or really anything on
it if it's running too high for too long
with a high voltage but that is part of
how you create a stable overclock so
here's what we're running at right now
I've got it at 13 90 megahertz I've
maxed out our voltage to 1150 and I know
that's stable that's what we showed in
our previous video
we're at 2200 megahertz for the
frequency I know that's stable for this
particular card it's not going to be the
same for yours so don't just copy these
settings power percent limit we're at
150% fan rpm ignore it because we have a
custom fan on there for the blower fan
for this overclock while it wasn't
possible but for the 13 50 megahertz
overclock we did do for the blower fan
and reference card I had the fan at 3800
- 4100 rpm it was very loud but it
worked and kept it reasonably cool you
see we're at 25 degrees Celsius ambient
is 24 ish so we're actually pretty darn
cool right now and that's because of the
liquid but you will be closer to the 80s
so now let's go ahead and reset this we
know this works but I want to show you
how to get here so reset the first thing
this is your default setup with AMD and
you can see we're actually at a
frequency percentage offset using what's
called a frequency voltage curve this
offsets the frequency for different
voltage States this is going to be a
lower voltage that's slightly higher
higher still and then the highest and
this is basically to allow stepping of
the card so when you're at idle or
running an easy game or browser it will
run a lower frequency lower voltage and
thus draw less power
samesies angle here and Nvidia's angle
as well but for overclocking we're going
to change this to dynamic which really
just means manual and I'm going to enter
manually the same frequency across the
board because I want to benchmark this
so I want a 100% stable frequency is not
required but it is what I recommend
before doing that we're going to run the
stress test in the background go to
gpu-z let's open a new one here just to
clear it out it's going to pop up a
warning because I'm not connected to my
server and go to sensors and the
settings I want to click twice on
voltage so we get max voltage twice on
GP power so we get max power observe the
core clock as we go and make sure it's
hitting the numbers that you configure
because if it's not it means we need to
change something to make sure it hits
those numbers otherwise you're not
actually doing anything okay so with
3dmark in the background generating a
load you can see here this is my
previous stepping I would recommend to
opening a notepad plus plus or
spreadsheet file we're going to create a
few rows we'll have core clock we're
going to have the power target actually
let's do V core the core power % mem
clock and then a pass/fail let's call it
five-minute test
pass/fail 60 minute test so first of all
our core clock let's go ahead and start
overclocking I know that the stock out
of box setup for this card is 12 66
megahertz boost so you can set it there
to start validate it works we know it
does and once you're there we can start
overclocking you want to do increments
here so I'm going to do an increment of
about 25-30 let's go let's go to
thirteen hundred megahertz 1300 across
the board that's a good starter if
that's stable we can increase from there
you may leave voltage at Auto for now
once you get stability issues I would
recommend going to manual change it
manually course their speed for memory
leave it alone we will mess with that
once the card is actually hitting its
limit for the core clock apply those
settings let's go over here so take a
look at the GPU clock despite being
configured to 1,300 across the board
we're not actually hitting that and
that's not because 3dmark is not
generating the load it's because the
card is throttling so let's let's go
over here and we will say let's let's
just call this a good 1,000 megahertz v
core auto power target 100 percent 1000
mem clock 2000 and we know this will
pass because it's the stock setup
basically so let's go ahead I'll show
you how to unlock that thing I'm going
to offset this by 50 doing too much
power and too much voltage will damage
your card long term especially if it's
cooled poorly so do this at your own
risk but we are going to just go ahead
and do things to the extreme here
because who cares it's our Hardware not
yours so I don't really really care if
it dies ISO 13 hundred megahertz we're
now hitting that properly core I'm going
to enter 1,300 Auto 150 I know this
passes we're just going to put pass so
now we've got this fixed now that we're
getting an actual stable clock right at
the number we configured we can start
offsetting this I would recommend doing
increments of 20 megahertz you can cut
through all this okay so we've offset
this to 1320 Tec gpu-z validate it is
1320 and the rest is all the same
settings now I am going to put pass here
because I know it passes we're doing
this for speed reasons you should let
this run for a minimum 5 minutes I know
that's not enough for a stable overclock
but hear me out
5 minutes look for artifacting look for
flickering and look for driver failures
if any of those happen then you either
need to increase your voltage increase
your power target if you have not maxed
it out yet or you need to decrease your
clock because you've hit your maximum
stable clock so we're going to go
through do 5-minute tests on each of
these overclocks
until we find the one that makes it
fail almost immediately once we find
that point we'll start running longer
endurance tests and down clock as
necessary
I know 1320 is stable let's go up to
1350 now on our reference card we failed
at 13 40 megahertz but this is no longer
a reference card we put an aftermarket
liquid cooler on it so it can actually
go much higher all right so we let this
run for a few minutes it looks good go
ahead and increase that again at this
point we're getting to where we want to
probably offset by about 10 megahertz at
a time I know where it fails already I'm
gonna do 20 I would advise that as you
begin approaching kind of where
reviewers another and your peers hit
their limit I would advise going down to
10 megahertz offsets to see if you can
really pinpoint that point of failure
and minimize any risk for other events
now here's where I'm going to change
this all right so I'm going to change
this to manual voltage control let me
show you something the maximum setting
if I type in 2000 millivolts watch what
happens it resets that means Andy is
protecting you and that video will do
this as well from doing too much 11:50
is the max they allow you should
probably do either either leave it on
auto if you don't know what you're doing
or if you do know what you're doing keep
it closer to kind of where and these got
their default settings and increase only
when you start getting failures for
example I would maybe start at 1100 and
see how stable it is and then increase
from there on time accessing out because
again we know you know what it's capable
of okay so we've been stable at 1380
let's go to 1390 we're doing 10
megahertz offsets now to see you know
it'd be a little easier on the card and
at this point we're getting near where
we'll be overclocked in the memory as
well
3ds any potential bottlenecks but also
because we're going to hit a max on the
core let's check on GPU Z while while
we're sitting here waiting for this to
burn and gpu-z says we are still at 13
90s so we know it's actually working
it's not throttling itself temperature
we're at 50 Celsius diode
this is an accurate reading you should
listen to it if you're hitting 89
Celsius 90 Celsius you want to increase
that fan rpm that's something we're
skipping here so this blower fan will
spin at 5200 rpm max it's really loud 60
decibels is about what we were getting
but if you want to stabilize that
overclock reduce your temperatures try
and keep it to 80 85 Celsius that will
help you out a lot and you're probably
gonna need to be at 4000 rpm so that's
where I would manually set that and you
do that in the bottom left of the
software power draw we're at one point
one 375 that's pretty high board or GPU
power excuse me we're at 187 watts that
adding on the board power puts us a
little over 200 close to 220 watts it's
a lot of power so we're getting near the
limit of this thing let's go ahead and
push the 1,400 it apply okay so the
video cards in the process of failing as
you can see we've crashed a screen run
black and Radeon Settings is now turned
semi-transparent GPZ is dropping the
clock rate so we know this thing's
failed the best thing to do at this
point because of the current instability
of the program quite obviously it's
still dying we're going to restart and
then jump back into it and now you've
seen how it fails I'll show you how to
do the stepping
all right so we saw it crash it crashed
at around 1400 megahertz
that's just where this car that happens
to fail yours will not be the same so
don't copy my numbers because it's not
going to work out the same way so it
fails there we can go ahead and enter in
this table 1411 5150 saw mm memory not
22 mm
on the five minutes and failed on the
endurance failed at around six minutes
or so it's not even really properly
endurance but we're just going to do
that so we know that's the point of
failure I've dialed it back down to
thirteen ninety at this point you run a
burnin so let it run for sixty minutes
see if it survives spoiler alert I knows
art I know ours does so we're going to
say pass pass on the endurance and then
next it's time to play with the memory
thirteen ninety we don't do that
thirteen ninety alone 5150 M memory I'm
going to leave it on auto frequency and
it's at 2,000 megahertz click that
button set its dynamic let's do one
hundred megahertz at a time at max is at
2250 hit apply we're at 2100 with a 13
90 and I know this pass is at five
minutes we're going to put pass let it
sit you know let it burn in C it does
any flickering if it does step it back
or increase the voltage manually so next
twenty two hundred would be our next 100
megahertz offset you can probably do
fifty at this point really to just be
safe but 1390 so at this point it
becomes a question does it pass or fail
I know it does for this and then if we
go to 2250 it will fail and then we back
it down to 2200 we back this down to
thirteen ninety as it is now run the
endurance test for sixty to one hundred
twenty minutes see how it does if it
looks good then you can kind of let it
run a little longer and see how it burns
in okay so that that is how to overclock
the and the RX 480
before you do this on your own and I
kind of stayed at this at the beginning
but be very careful of your power drop
in general
/ volting is bad for silicon if you over
bolt too much especially with a cpu
which will let you go higher than
something like this well when you're
over volting just don't go too crazy
check guides online make sure you stay
within kind of the recommended
limitations so you don't hurt anything
thermals are concerned make sure the
thermals are reasonable increase your
fan rpm as necessary or get a better
card with better cooler or get one of
these aftermarket coolers that we've
done and put it on yourself the next
concern is power draw this board in
particular is special it's got its
drawing too much power through the PCIe
bus that's something we've seen several
reviews on now we validated it ourselves
kind of lightly and I'll do more on that
in the future but you will want either
you want a very good motherboard if
you're going to start pushing 50% power
limit like we did and you want something
like extra power headers this EVGA x99
classified board has a six pin header
down here giving us extra power to the
PCIe bus that means it is reducing
strain on the 24 pin but you're still
going to be kind of really really
pushing a little bit on power
lissa do you keep an eye on that you
don't want to run it too long and don't
run it like that on a cheap board with
150 percent power it might not be good
for the board but we are researching
that so I'll let you know if how that
hold is true so that's how to do it if
you have a questions post and below do
my best to answer check the articles for
more details on this our our x 480
review article has a couple paragraphs
on overclock and that will recap this
data and talk about how to do it in case
you missed anything I would strongly
recommend doing one of the sort of
notepad files that I was showing you
that will help you keep track of things
save it as you go other than that that's
