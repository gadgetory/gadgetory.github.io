dotnet and this is our CPU benchmark for
Fallout 4 which is now a full day of old
so obviously that means the game has
become irrelevant in the eyes of the
greater games industry but we have a bit
of content left in Fallout 4 before
moving on to whatever the next things
may be and some of that content includes
our CPU benchmark which I just conducted
you can find the full article link in
the description below and the CPU
benchmark basically just takes all the
CPUs that we had available and if it's
not on the charts then we probably don't
have it so the CPUs tests that include
the g3 - 580 at the low end for Intel
the 810 78 70 K at the low end for Andy
and then a number of i3 i5 Zeiss Evans
and and the FX CPUs including the FX
9000 and 8000 series so that's our
listing of products you can check the
full article in the description below
for more methodology on how we conducted
the tests but we did opt to use the gtx
980ti hybrid which is an EVGA card and
we use that because it's our best
performing single GPU solution so we
wanted to obviously eliminate GPU
bottlenecks wherever possible
now fallout 4 is pretty aggressive on
the GPU consumption so even the 980ti
hybrid does bottleneck at some points
like the higher settings and high
resolutions so it's not entirely
possible to eliminate a bottleneck on
the GPU right now with fallout 4 but we
got pretty close in terms of just being
able to see the absolute performance
data between the CPUs and get a good
feeling for where everything falls our
hypothesis going into this was that the
i5 and i7 would be pretty similar in
performance just from a purely
theoretical standpoint that's kind of
what I was expecting going into the test
so we tested the i3 41:30
the i5 4690k and the i7 4790k which are
all the same generation CPUs alongside
our other CPUs tested and looked to them
to determine where the differences of
lie and the i3 I was expecting to
perform pretty well but certainly lower
than the i5 and i7 the i5 and i7 I was
expecting to perform very similarly so
let's look at the data and see how it
actually panned out and
1440p at Ultra is a fairly GPU intensive
test so do keep that in mind but we
still wanted to run it and see what the
Delta was between the CPUs with the
provision that there would be some GPU
limitation the 1440 ultra test shows the
FPS output is limited to about 83 FPS on
the 4790k and the 59 30 K and if we move
down to I 5 CPUs the 6600 K and 4690k
the framerate drops a considerable
amount at 15.6 percent so that's a
pretty big Delta it still remains above
60 FPS though and that's all that really
matters for this game because of the
game time in physics ty fps so
considering this greater than 60 fps
playback for anything other than
benchmarking isn't really too important
and once you change the GPU from the
980ti hybrid to something else that 15.5
80% Delta could come into play a lot
more so if you down class the GPU from
what we used here do calculate that in
to make sure that you're still staying
above board on the frame rate so keep
gpo choice in mind when looking at these
charts the FX 95 90 technically plays at
1440 ultra but we faced severe
framedrops and stuttering with the cpu
and that's a trait characteristic of the
95 90s high TDP we found this to be true
in other games as well so this is not a
unique fallout 4 issue but the frame
drops are severe enough that we probably
dropped the settings down if I were
actually to play this game with a 95 90
so that the stuttering and the frame
drops are less severe and then the i3
falls far from the i7 starting point
drop in 44 percent against the i7 and 29
percent against I 5 quite a difference
in both regards at 1440 we see nearly a
30 percent performance advantage awarded
to the i5 CPUs over the i3 CPUs and the
59 30 K exhibits stronger a low frame
times then it's a non extreme cousins so
if you look at the 59 30 K and some of
these charts it will be outperformed by
the 4790k which again not a fallout
unique trait because it's happened in
other games certainly but the difference
here is really made in the low frame
times the one
seven point one percent frame times as
we move into 1080p we keep the same
ultra settings but drop resolution quite
a bit so the pixel count is way lower
and we see a higher FPS output obviously
but there's still a pretty big
performance curve so Delta between all
these CPUs is still large and there's
not great scaling for Fallout 4 across
our CPU lineup if you look at the i7
4790k and the i5 4690k same generation
both Devil's Canyon both refreshed as
well there's a framerate drop of 17%
from the i7 to the I 5 again a pretty
big drop and the performance advantage
of the 4790k
over the 59 30 K is again reflected in a
few games so this isn't abnormal to see
the 4790 trading blows at the 59 thirty
and the 59 30 K can be beaten out by the
4790k depending upon thread utilization
and game optimization for each game
tested and the same goes for the 6600 K
against the 4690k where you sometimes
see a maybe 1 FPS drop in performance
with a 6600 because of a latency
increase in the skylake memory subsystem
or some other sort of transactional bus
latency and this is reflected in our
6700 K benchmarks as well the i3 at 1080
ultra is presented with a massive
bottleneck of about 54 percent against
the i7 and when we look at the i-5
pairing the bottleneck is still about
37% so that's a big difference between
an i3 on i-5 and the big hits continue
and remain the case with the 95 90 am
these high-end FX CPU with low frame
times in these 16 40.1% lows and these
are noticeable enough to impact play so
that's again some sort of frame drop
stuttering issue and then finally we
look at some of the medium benchmarks
just to get a better feel for things and
eliminate more of the GPU bottleneck and
some of the cpus here are equalizing due
to the load on the GPU and CPU sort of
mixing load mixing on the game side but
the performance gap still exists the i3
to i-5 to i7 Delta
is in order 29% from the i3 ti5 24.6%
from the i-5 to the i7 so still a big
difference and md's 95 90 is its best
performer of course but even the 220
watt TDP $200 CP losses to Intel's 4690k
by 20% in the frame rate Delta the 59
30k again allows for higher 0.1% low
frame rates fallout 4 is Omni pretty
aged and somewhat decrepit creation
engine and that engine definitely is
showing its age with regard to
optimization on the GPU and the CPU
sides so this Delta is from our testing
pretty tied to frequency Fallout 4 is a
very frequency hungry game obviously you
look at AMD and that's there's some
architecture that matters too because
AMD does have a higher Raw frequency but
the architecture is so different it's
not linearly comparable to Intel's
architecture so keep that in mind but
raw frequency is what matters after
architecture of course and the game does
utilize threads a bit that utilizes
hyper threading even it's just poorly
optimized so we see some odd performance
and some spurious positioning of the i3
and the i-5 and things like that so then
the important part the i3 you can get by
on some settings depending on what
you're running and obviously what your
GPU pairing is but it will bottleneck
mid-range and high end GPUs so you don't
don't want to buy a high end or
mid-range GPU put it with a an i3 CPU
and just choke your framerate heavily
because of that the i-5 has about a 30%
Delta against the i7 in some cases 17%
and others so pretty big difference
actually in this game and that was not
something that I expected to find
looking at an these high-end CPUs the 95
90 in this case the low frame rates are
pretty poor and that's just really an
issue with the CPU itself so you
encounter that at some setting levels
but not all of them and it can be worked
with it's just it's not great and it's
the smoothness of game plays pretty poor
at times at 1440 and 1080 maxed so that
is all for our CPU benchmark on Fallout
4 check out the GPU benchmarks the
volumetric lighting benchmark
