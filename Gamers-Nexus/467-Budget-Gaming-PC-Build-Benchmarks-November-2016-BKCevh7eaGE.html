together a budget build with just things
that I had lying around and available
and see how many corners I could cut and
what a very budget gaming PC is capable
of these days could have cut a few more
corners a cheaper motherboard for
instance would have certainly drop price
by 10 or so dollars maybe 15 but I
didn't have any in stock I did however
have an athlon x4 845 which is just
about the cheapest gaming grade cpu
currently on the market it's a $68 CPU
or thereabouts-- and we also had a GTX
1050 about 110 115 dollars and opted for
a fifty-dollar coarser case 50 after
rebate anyway so that's the 200 are so
this build is looking at really how does
it perform and if you wanted to spend
about in this instance 467 dollars on a
PC what should you expect from it in
terms of gaming frame rates power draw
thermals and boot times now there's a
few things here as stated again we've
got an app on x 4 845 at 68 bucks
there's a GTX 1050 game in from EVGA
$115 and Asus 888 X plus which includes
a free copy of doom I suppose if you
care about that and an 8 gigabyte kit of
2133 megahertz corsair vengeance pro
memory that I benchmarked years ago
that's pretty cheap now and then the
case that's on the table there's also a
500 watt EVGA 80 plus white power supply
for about thirty eight dollars and
interestingly this system could actually
be run with a lower wattage power supply
is something we talked about in the GTX
10 series the 1050 in the 1050 TI is
specifically those to review pieces talk
about the power supplies now and how you
could technically run a 300 watt psu and
power this thing just fine even if
you're pushing the CPU and the GPU
pretty hard through game and scenarios
but the power supply market for those
cheaper power supplies is really not
that mature yet I mean they've been
around for a while but these are things
that are often the really cheap no brand
Chinese power supplies that are 20 bucks
and would you really be better off not
buying at all and join with something a
bit more expensive and overkill
quote-unquote on the wall
or the price just doesn't really quite
line up with things so using a 500 watt
psu it's a bit overkill but it's not
that bad and if you ended up upgrading
maybe to an i3 with a higher-end GPU or
just whatever any kind of upgrade there
will be head room for it in the future
as for storage you've really got one
main option but there's an optional
option it's a lot of options the main
option of course is a 7200 RPM hard
drive at one terabyte you can get those
from sigue Inc of those from Western
Digital they tend to be fifty to sixty
dollars at this point pretty darn cheap
and a lot of storage so that's kind of
where you generally go for this type of
build the optional version would be
something like an SSD I picked up in m7
vplex or SSD they are fifty dollars for
128 gigabytes right now which is pretty
darn cheap not the cheapest i've seen
but pretty good considering the
performance of them so i would be and
the reason i picked that up my kind of
thinking with this is because i've been
doing this long enough that I'm ok with
waiting on upgrades and things like that
I would rather have a stable OS drive
that I don't have to worry about
refreshing later if my plan is to get an
SSD after I get a hard drive I'd rather
have a stable OS I don't have to screw
with if i upgrade and invest money later
and other components now the alternative
to this of course and it's a good point
to make is that if you buy something
like a fifty dollar hard drive you could
invest that fifty dollars you would also
spend on an SSD because you probably
need to you need one for storage and one
for your OS because one quick gigabytes
is decent but can't fit many games on
that so you probably need to that fifty
dollars extra of course you can put
towards an i3 cpu that would boost
performance pretty reasonably you can
put it towards a GPU I would put it
forward toward the CPU in this case but
still m7 b is what I went with just
because I am a bit spoiled by SSDs at
this point so I wanted to test with one
of those we're also sticking with amd's
stock quote unquote near-silent solution
for the cpu since the export 845 really
doesn't need anything more powerful than
that and it's a bit cheaper that way the
entire build took me about 30 minutes
obviously bit of experience here but
after KO management time the build
itself getting it in the case
it was about half an hour of work so
pretty trivial to set up let's start the
test with thermals that noise an FPS for
full testing methodology as always check
the link in the description below our
thermal values r delta t / ambience so
add your own house ambient temperature
into the results to get an idea for
performance in your environment for most
houses it's probably about 70 72
fahrenheit which would be about 20 21 22
celsius because we can't take an
accurate temperature measurement of andy
cpus unfortunately they don't report
properly to software and always appear
colder than ambient which is impossible
by the way unless you're using ln2 or
something where I looking at GP attempts
here we can have delta T values the GTX
1050 game Ian from EVGA is hitting about
26.8 Celsius under a simple gaming
workload and adding your ambient
temperatures of that for an idea of
where to land ultimately probably
generally be in the 40s just under 50
Celsius or thereabouts Idol is about
3.85 Celsius delta T over ambient and
really not bad the case here is
providing adequate cooling for these
components and it is just a two fan case
at 50 bucks but for a low-end build like
this that's perfectly fine here's a look
at the builds power consumption power
draw is about 143 wats when running a
CPU and GPU intensive gaming workload
with idle desktop consumption at about
39 242 watts and that's after accounting
for PFC and efficiency when measuring
from the wall under a gaming workload
and with max case fan speed and auto
controlled CPU and GPU fans that were
seen noise levels about 37 decibels with
this particular build you could lower
the noise levels significantly by opting
for a tower cooler and using the SSD
does also lower noise levels a bit
because the hard drive occasionally will
do what you would expect it would do it
spins and makes noise so 37 DBA is what
we see with the SSD and with auto
controlled CPU GPU under gaming workload
and then obviously the tower cooler
would help but this is cheap so for
thermal reasons it's not really
necessarily worth the investment for a
tower cool or aftermarket option but for
noise reasons it might be that's up to
you very quick test here for boot up
times with the SSD and the build our
boot up time
about 15 seconds to get fully into
windows will soon be benchmarking this
drive though against other SSDs that we
have and against hard drives to keep an
eye out for that content in the future
let's get to FPS testing with GTA 5 at
1080p with high settings configured
across the board though with three
sliders maxed we're seeing an average of
about 60 FPS with lows around 36 FPS 1%
and 23 FPS 0.1% low it's not terrible
especially when you consider that this
is a $68 cpu and $115 GPU stutters can
be partially resolved by reducing CPU
intensive graphics options further but
they are infrequent enough that a
builder on a budget this strict could
reasonably enjoy gta5 at high settings
at very high in ultra settings again
sort of surprisingly performance is
actually not bad it's still it's about
10 FPS lower than what we saw with the
high settings you're bit more stuttery
obviously but not terrible the CPU is
hurting performance of the most with GTA
5 we've shown that in the past let's
look at overwatch we're seeing an
average FPS output of an impressive 75
with overwatch though the low metrics do
hurt the system's ability to avoid
stuttering during more intense battles
but again this is with ultra settings if
you were to drop settings down to a mix
of medium and high with care taken to
lower quality and the CPU bound effects
you'll resolve those stutters pretty
quickly overwatch is reasonably playable
on this setup it you could definitely
have fun with it and is exactly the kind
of game that the 1050 and 845 are meant
to play just know that you'll have to
reduce settings down to again a mix of
medium and high speaking of games that
these devices are meant to play
battlefield one is not one of those it
is definitely the opposite but I still
tested it because it's a new game and I
was curious we're seeing performance
with 1080p medium settings at around 47
FPS average 26 FPS one percent lows and
20 FPS 0.1 percent lows the dips in
frame times and frame rates are
definitely noticeable here we saw about
an 8 FPS improvement moving from ultra
at 39.7 fps to medium but you might
still have to shift down to low settings
and
then you'd be dealing with difficulties
when running multiplayer if you have
your heart set on battlefield one it's
probably best to invest a bit more than
something more powerful and I three
would be a good start we show that in
our CPU benchmark for battlefield one as
would a 1050 TI both of those would be
capable of playing at about 60 FPS with
ultra settings at 1080p a bit below
depending on your multiplayer match ups
an rh 470 of course would be another
good option but it is stepping a bit
higher in the price area dota 2 is next
it's got medium settings at 1080p and
produces an average FPS of 60 17 with
low is hovering around 35 and 19 FPS
really again not bad overall that with
occasional stutters dota is a bit harder
to control for with the stutters we
generally notice that it's not as
consistent as frame times as some other
games we test but you can still account
for some of that in these settings by
fine-tuning for the CPU and next with
doom at 1080p and medium settings in
OpenGL we're seeing an FPS output of
about 53 average 21 and the one percent
low is 18 and the 0.1% blows and
remember this is a game that was
provided for you with one of the
components Vulcan negatively scales of
this particular setup and isn't worth
the showing we tested it with ultra
against OpenGL at ultra and negatively
scaled so you should be running OpenGL
for this particular game and system so
then the question of course is this type
of system worth building it's pretty
cheap like I said if you were going to
do this yourself this is a good starting
point for a system guide I'll have all
the links on description below you could
alter a bit lower end motherboard i did
use this one because we had it and
because it will fully support the memory
spec and that's actually beneficial in
some titles append what you're looking
at and you could probably shave a few
bucks off maybe in the video card
department five dollars saved if you go
for zotac instead of EVGA so yeah it
could be dropped probably to about 450
pretty safely and that's without getting
bad untrustworthy power supply or things
and entering into the territory of
components that will more likely die
without actually putting any load on
them that's severe enough to kill a
normal component so this is a safe
baseline for a cheap build under five
hundred dollars is it
worth it depends on what you're doing so
overwatch and dota 2 performed pretty
decently the lows were kind of iffy
depending on which game you're looking
at what settings those can be mostly
accounted for all these titles really
had kind of poor low performance
depending again on the settings but if
you end up opting more towards medium
settings and take care to look through
and sort of step down anything that CPU
bound because that's the big limiter
here then it would be fine and the
average FPS for things like GTA
overwatch and dota is great for all
three of those titles it just becomes a
minimums game and GTA 5 the minimums
were actually pretty bearable when
actually playing the game and looking at
it more heuristic alee it's it's pretty
tolerable so not a bad build if you're
looking to play something more intense
than overwatch and dota maybe
battlefield one it does make sense to
step into i3 territory on a 1050 TI at
sort of a baseline you could get x 1050
but it's a bit rough 1050 tii through
kind of be my baseline then from there
if you've got more money look into an RX
470 things like that and we'll be doing
another one of these build guides pretty
soon the idea is to do something like a
700 750 dollar build hit this against
that and then see what the difference is
with a two hundred fifty dollar
additional investment and hopefully show
kind of is it worth stepping up for
users who haven't done this before and
don't necessarily know now of course
there's a million ways to criticize
builds I've seen you all do it to Linus
and to others there's a lot of ways to
build a computer that's the cool thing
about PC building so like I said these
components are off the shelf here you
could opt for a different case you get
out for a different power supply
whatever you want to do feel free to do
that but that's what I put together it's
pretty cheap I would recommend it to a
friend who's playing pretty lightweight
games but other than that it's a step up
