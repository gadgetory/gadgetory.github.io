FTW 3 card it's a 2080 first ones to do
it
I'm sure someone else has already posted
stuff because we had a crowd of people
taking photos on my shoulder
thanks guys hey I really appreciate it
I'm sure you credited us alright so you
know where it came from though it's a
tu-104 408 a 1 GPU it's an RT X 2080
almost a GTX before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focus build which is partly thanks
to the airflow design and the removal of
a bottom power supply shroud for a
balance of looks and performance check
the link in the description below for
the view 37 so this card will talk about
the PCB in a moment erm all that stuff
I've got some information but kulish
pretty straightforward so it's it's just
a bunch of heat pipes on the back 2.75
slot really thick all aluminum VIN stack
and then three fans and then there are
three fan connectors that plug into the
side of the PCB so I'm really nothing
that different for what we normally work
with it's all three head fan headers
plug into the bottom right over here on
this card
we have b-roll taking it all apart a bit
curious but I think the cooler is pretty
straightforward if you've seen previous
EVGA cooler so that's the cooler as far
as the PCB you already know the GPU is
it is an RT X 2080 the PCB is using a 12
plus 2 phase design and it is a PWM
split to drive to MOSFETs each so one
PWM signal for two feds and that is
using on semi ft 11 31 70s will talk to
builds right about this later if you
want a bill toid PCB analysis will
probably have one the controller is a
UPI you p90 512 and that's what I've got
for the BRM specs right now so that's
EVGA FTW three has taken down with the
at their booth at Gamescom for the r-tx
2080 and just one more time here
it is a tu-104 480 - hey one sample
typically the last
one just means revision one or revision
a one in this case so that's what we got
for you check to all of the coverage of
EVGA a booth on our channel it's already
up for the other three cards and then we
have b-roll of taking it all apart I
mean I'll just really quickly cover the
base plate this is entirely new the
folks taking photos are my shoulder clod
and notice it but there is a plate right
in the middle here that's contacting
between the BRM components and the big
heat sink so it's got two sets of throw
pods on this side on the top side going
into the heatsink and then another set
of thrown pads on the back and it looks
like yes even a small heat pipe in there
so the small nickel-plated heat pipe in
there copper nickel plating heat pipe
with contact to the MOSFETs and then
another contact plate with the throw pad
to the chokes and I think that covers
the whole card so yeah that's EB J's FTW
three you didn't see here first but we
were the ones to do it first thanks for
watching subscribe for more go to store
dock cameras Nexus net or
patreon.com/scishow sexist helps out
directly and we're also gonna be talking
to their Bower
after the hiss so check back for that
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
