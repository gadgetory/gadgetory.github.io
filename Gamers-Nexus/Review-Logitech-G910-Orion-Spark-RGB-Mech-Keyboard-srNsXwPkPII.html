Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
this this is a Logitech snoot g 9/10
keyboard using the roamer g switches
which it's a brand new switch type it's
not cherry it's not kale it's called
Romer G it is built by Logitech and they
built it for endurance so the big
difference here is the switch type which
we'll get to in a second going over the
features this is a 180 ish dollar
keyboard it's fully RGB enabled meaning
it's got all the red green blue LEDs you
can do tons of color combinations not
quite sure how many but it's a lot more
than you can care about and it uses a
full color palette swatch type thing
that you'd find in photoshop in Logitech
software to change the colors you can
individually change the color of keys so
if you want WASD to be different or if
you want your mobile keys to be
different you can save a profile for
that and then it'll highlight those
based on whatever you set in the
settings you can also do all kinds of
breathing effects and things like that
if you like the aesthetics there's a lot
more to it than that though you can
program the RGB switches so that in
theory once game developers support this
you could actually have a cool-down
mapping on one of your keys so if you
wanted e to be red when your ability is
depleted and you want it to glow or
breathe green when it's ready for use
you can actually program that into this
and that's not the easiest thing in the
world to do so if someone else has done
it you can grab it online of course on a
forum and download the profile so that's
pretty cool it's not really implemented
yet don't go out buying it expecting
that right now but it's something we'll
keep an eye on and as soon as I see it
available I'll do a video on how to how
to implement that and how to program
these the keyboard has a full media
panel on it's got play stop pause give
back which is pretty awesome for gaming
because I like to listen to music
sometimes when I game but when I'm the
last person on the csgo team or whatever
I want to pause that music so I can hear
everything and make sure I know where
the footsteps are that's sort of what
this is useful for it also has a volume
wheel you need to scroll up and down if
you want to change the volume and it's
got mute if you want to mute everything
and that's been around for a while now
on keyboards I'm a big fan of it I know
some people aren't but I like it and
it's there if you need it it does not
have the USB ports that the g7 10 plus
had and it
the g7 10 plus to two USB slots because
would power those USB ports and this
doesn't have it which I really wish it
did have one because now it makes sense
now Logitech has added this they call
arcs doc let me see if I can so I pop
that up right there that is a phone doc
it's a cold doc and all it does is hold
your phone which it's dud Y right Y so
it would it would be cool if I could
power the phone if it were a hot foot or
a hot shoe that I could just plug the
phone into or have it microUSB coming
out of here into the board because then
at least you can charge your phone while
you're using Logitech's application they
have a mobile app that will show you
things like your system resource usage
and things like that and it sort of
replaces the LCD that was found on the
g15 keyboard so that's where they've
gone with LCD they basically say put
your phone in it it's cheaper for all of
us and that's true but it all you're
doing is killing your battery unless you
charge the phone with another cable
going up to your desk so I'd really like
to see that expanded on in future
iteration so that it makes more sense
aside from that of course the big news
is the Romer G switch I have talked
about this with Logitech before we've
got a video on the channel discussing
the Romer G switches switch types are a
big deal with keyboards because that's
what creates the mechanical feeling
that's why it doesn't feel like a
membrane keyboard that a lot of people
hate now after being spoiled by
mechanical so it switches we have kale
we have cherry we have taupe er stuff
like that and then we've got now Romer G
and there are plenty of other ones in
between too but those are the big ones
kale and cherry especially cherry is
sort of the premier brand they are
manufactured in Germany they have
switched shortages all the time that's
why we have trouble finding hammocks
green and they're used in really
everything Coolermaster logitech uses
them the g7 10 plus which is similar to
this in concept uses the MX browns which
is that a rubber damped and that rubber
damper it's basically just an o-ring on
the bottom of the switch so when you
push it down it doesn't make as loud of
a clack and this is about the same sound
and feeling as a rubber damped MX Brown
switch so it doesn't have the loud
clicky clack e responsiveness that
hammocks Blues have but it's also less
fatiguing it's quieter people who want
quieter keyboards and
that's sometimes a thing that's
desirable you don't always want the
loudest keyboard in the room at least I
don't and I know a lot of you do but
that's the great thing about switches
because we have lots of choices out
there so with the romaji switches
they're theoretically rated at about 70
million key clicks that is a lot of
clicks you're not going to kill this
board you'll probably upgrade before you
do cherry switches are about 50 million
and kale are about at really anyone's
guess it's about 40 million from what
I've seen but we have no way to validate
that with kale so that's it's sort of
kale cherry and our emoji in terms of
the switch endurance and it's it's
there's a lot more to it than switch
endurance though there's also the look
and the feel and in terms of the feel
these feel ok there there's no color
variation so it's just romaji there's no
Romer Blue Room or brown Romer red
whatever it's just rumor that's it
that's there's only one so if you don't
like it you're out of luck if you like
MX browns you should try this see if a
local hardware vendor has it that we can
try it first but give it a shot and you
might like what you feel if you don't
like MX brown if you especially don't
like damn to MX brown from the 710 plus
which is another one you can try then
you really you won't like this it's not
going to be loud enough it's not going
to be tactile clacking enough for you
the Romer G switches do have a shallow
actuation depth of only 1.5 millimeters
so if you are doing a lot of typing this
will actually feel kind of good because
it doesn't require that much effort to
push the keys down it's very easy to
depress the keys but it's that's why
it's not as loud so it's it's a
trade-off there I like the shallower
actuation death and the quieter noise
you might not that's okay in terms of
the look the new switches have a giant
hole in the middle for LEDs and that
hole comes with it a lens there's
actually a lens in the hole to amplify
the strength of the LED so it's the LED
sits underneath it it goes through the
glass lens and then is amplified outward
so you get a much brighter more vibrant
color with the LEDs as you can see in
our shots of the keyboard in the dark
and that's a lot different from Cherry
where you've got more plastic flanking
the LED and sometimes the LED gets in
the way of the switch so they have to
engineer a new way to push down the
switches without really violating the
LEDs space as
you can see in our Coursera RGB keyboard
unveil we did at CES either this year
last year that sort of shows that
technology as it was being invented and
Logitech has furthered it with romaji
so Logitech's board overall I'm a fan of
the way the switches feel but I also
like the way MX brown switches feel when
they're damped if you don't like that
feeling don't buy this because you won't
like it if you like that feeling and the
relative quietness of MX browns dent
you'll like this keyboard in terms of
whether you should buy it it's still
$180 board so it's really competing with
the 170 Corsair RGB board and that's got
similar software
it's got Lua scripting support things
that Logitech also has Logitech software
is much more impressive in my opinion
they really they have a lot of things
going for them with their software I'm
excited to see where it goes in the
future that doesn't change the fact that
it's an expensive keyboard so you really
at this price point you're looking
between Corsairs r DB and Logitech's new
RGB board this one because the cheaper
ones like Roseville's 120 $100 keyboard
120 I think rgba T it is an RGB board
but it's tkl it doesn't have this 10 key
over here it doesn't have the media
panel doesn't have any of the other
fancy features and this author is pretty
bad so that's what the extra money gets
you for Corsair and Logitech in this
situation Logitech you're spending a bit
extra money for other features
definitely spending a bit more premium
for the romaji switches but that's what
happens when you buy new technology
theoretically the romaji switches last
an extra 20 million clicks or so over
cherry that's a pretty big deal if
you're trying to use this forever so it
might be an okay investment if you're
really able to get that life out of
these switches and Logitech does have a
warranty program if not but still it's
$180 courses is 170 I would be a buyer
of either of them at those prices I'd be
a buyer at about 150 because I just have
a really hard time justifying almost
$200 on a keyboard when I know I could
spend a hundred get a single color LED
which Logitech and Corsair and everyone
else makes and then spend that extra 80
ish dollars on something like an SSD
which will have any huge impact on your
everyday use case scenarios in your
computer so that's really where it
stands it's how much money do you have
to spend for effectively a toy
and this is a fun toy to play with
because it's got all these cool switch
color options in the in the software the
software is really pretty advanced with
scripting and it's it's fun to play with
just do you want to spend the money so
that's what you have to think about as a
buyer are you willing to spend an extra
$80 for RGB colors and and a new switch
so that is everything for this review of
logitech c910 Orion spark RGB keyboard
it is a mechanical keyboard it has
romaji switches they feel similar to MX
brown dance switches if you don't like
those you won't like the keyboard it has
RGB colors that is really what you're
paying for and that's all you need to
know 180 ish bucks check the link in the
description below for full details a
link to the product and all of that and
I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
