this card is supposed to be priced at
472 480 dollars and it was when we
originally filmed this review but we had
to add this part in because now it's
$900 which makes it absolutely not at
all worth it however in the event the
prices come back down to 472 480 this
review should serve as your guide so if
you're watching this just basically use
the review if the prices are reasonable
and if the prices are still 800 + then
don't buy the card at all period and
this one lands just between 1080 s and
the baseline 1070 ti reference card with
of course vega 56 nebulously in the area
depending on how retailers feel at that
day before that this video is brought to
you by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below a couple of things
here about this video card this one
might be appealing to you because it's a
three fan cooler and it's reasonably
priced the cooler however is running a 2
slot form factor configuration so a lot
of the larger fan coolers on the market
lately have been two and a half or even
slightly more for the expansion slot
size and that means that although it
will fit in a lot more builds more
easily it is using a much thinner
radiator or heatsink if you prefer in
fact it it's significantly thinner it's
about half the thickness of what we saw
on the recent 2.5 it slot design for the
EVGA 1070 TI ultra silent or whatever
they're calling it so quite a bit
different MSI has tended to stick to two
slot designs there Twin Frozr coolers
typically have used two slot designs
although there are some that have gone
larger and this one is what they're
calling a tri froze our cooler so three
fans dry frozer it is not really as
simple as three fans equals better
though it's not more more is more better
because the Twin Frozr fans
are taller and a bit wider so this is
just going for three smaller fans
instead as for the advocacy of the
cooler we're really focusing on that
today with video cards as many of you
know at this point if you've seen our
channel the difference between tarda and
card be within the same class ie 1070 TI
is pretty small in fact the difference
in gaming performance out of box is
clock for clock far more likely to vary
based on the silicon quality than it is
based on the actual card or the vendor
itself if msi makes one of these an EVGA
makes a similar one the difference
between them gaming wise and FPS wise is
almost certainly going to hinge more on
which one had the better silicon when
you bought it so for that reason we're
focusing on the thermal cooling ability
is the noise levels and some
overclocking potential versus the
colorful 1070 TI volc√°n x that we
reviewed all of which will come together
to help us understand how good of a card
it actually is we also have vrm
information coming out hopefully
somewhat soon that will be done by
builds Oya if you want to see the power
component analysis from an overclockers
perspective let's get into thermals
first for the full testing methodology
as always check the article linked in
the description below that contains our
test bench and our test methods starting
with a complete stock auto test for
out-of-the-box thermals we measured the
gtx 1070 TI duke at about 49 degrees
celsius over ambient and again that's a
delta t number so it is del z
arraignment for the GPU diode rating
we're at 49 and this was during our
standardized power buyers torture test
the MOSFETs operated at about 51 degrees
Celsius over ambient with the hottest
gddr5 module measuring at 65 degrees for
the MOSFET and memory measurements we
are using k-type thermocouple that are
1/100 of an inch thick they are laser
thin for a direct component contact
measurement and this is effectively a
case measurement we don't have many 1070
TI cards tested yet but these
measurements place the MSI Duke markedly
behind the only other 1070 Ti currently
on our bench the colorful Vulcan X the
Vogon X operated about 8 degrees cooler
on the GPU temperature 2 to 3 degrees
cooler for the MOSFETs though those
aren't
direct comparison since there are
different vets and about three to four
degrees warmer for the memory keep in
mind that MOSFET temperature here is
largely irrelevant because all we're
really going for is making sure it's
within spec which these are they are
well under spec in fact for both of them
although one is more under spectrum the
other the Vogon acts had an unimpressive
base plate and vram cooling solution so
these numbers make sense where MSI is a
bit better for the vram cooling the Duke
is one of the warmest cards on the bench
though and part of the reasoning is
because Emma size fan profile and V bios
simply isn't aggressive enough and the
fans are kind of weak to begin with
during Auto testing the fans tend to
stick to around 38 to 42 percent speed
with an ambient temperature of about 21
to 22 Celsius and this has them at about
30 decibels of noise that's way too
conservative we've noticed that MSI
seems to target about 66 degrees Celsius
for the core temperature and so they are
adjusting fan speeds based on that
target
this means that memory can sometimes run
warmer because the fans don't need to
spin very fast for the GPU to be 66
degrees but the vram doesn't have any
governance over the fan speeds here are
some noise normalized numbers with
thermals tested at 40 decibels
normalized for all tested cards the
eye-catching thing here is that thermal
performance improved the one set to 40
decibels output which is untrue for
nearly every other card on the bench
this happens only for one reason
the fans are spinning faster at 40
decibels despite 40 decibels being
generally on the lower end of video card
noise emissions the Duke performs about
8 degrees warmer than the Vulcan acts
when both are at 40 decibels with a GPU
temperature of 45 point 4 degrees
Celsius delta T over ambient we're also
seeing a mosfet temperature of 45
degrees on the MSI Duke Card about the
same as what the Vulcan X saw and a 58
degree memory temperature whereas
colorfull ran 64 degrees speaking of
noise here's a look at that noise levels
show the msi 1070 TI duke toward the
very bottom edge of the pack when at
each rpm level and this is a PWM signal
to noise response curve most graphics
cards like to keep their fans at around
50 to 55 percent so we'll highlight that
area of the decibel output and that is
used as a hard target in B BIOS general
the msi cards fans don't spin very fast
and tend to max out at around 3300 RPM
they're admittedly very quiet for the
most part until you hit a hundred
percent or so but they are also
ineffective at cooling again considering
40 decibels was a faster speed than auto
the tuning is much different from most
cards on the market as for overclocking
here's our overclocked stepping chart we
found the msi duke card to be stable
briefly at 225 megahertz core and 500
megahertz memory we ultimately began
crashing in games with those frequencies
though so we had to step down to 200
megahertz offset core and 450 megahertz
offset for the memory again these are
offsets not the actual speeds the clock
averaged about 20 50 megahertz in this
configuration which is one part power
limit and one part thermal limit Pascal
increases clock speed for roughly every
5 degrees Celsius on the core and if the
Duke were capable of cooling itself
below 60 degrees in our room ambient of
about 20 22 C we'd see a couple
megahertz higher clock we also ended up
peaking at around 20 88 megahertz though
hit a 21-14 megahertz core speed for
about half a second before crashing that
was with a 250 megahertz offset which
ultimately did not take here's our
colorful vulcan XO as he table for
reference for this one we got stuck at
around 20 88 megahertz table average
clock or 2120 six megahertz peak
frequency the results is better for the
Vulcan X and the resulting performance
and fire strikes shown here with fire
strike Ultra comes out to 53 66 points
versus 53 15 points for graphics this
was done on repeated testing and is
outside of error as we ran the test
numerous times an average did fire
strike Xtreme has us about 200 points
different as well once again favoring
the colorful card as you can see here
and now comes the usual reminder these
clocks don't necessarily mean you can
hit these clocks in fact you might do
better you could do a lot worse the
difference primarily will come down to
the actual silicon quality much like the
frequencies that you can hit out of box
will largely come down to silicon
quality not to the card itself or the
design of the PCB or really anything
else its silicon quality first then you
start wearing
things like cooling ability because
you've got that thermal limiter to worry
about and then from there power starts
to come into play once you're
overclocking but until then not so much
so this card is an instance of a
slightly below average cooler it's not
awful they do run actually pretty quiet
which is an upside relatively but
there's a reason that EVGA when they did
their ultra silent version fattened up
the heatsink it's because if you're
gonna run quieter fan speeds you do need
something else to help deal with the
heat it's generally more mass or more
surface area more specifically speaking
and this card if you kind of if we have
b-roll shots of the side of it or
anything you'll see just how thin that
heatsink is it's comparatively really
just about the same size as the heat
pipes so it's a lot smaller than what
you see normally and that's where the
difference in thermal performance it's
coming from before the most part the
fans are a bit weak but they're not the
worst because again they are at least
somewhat quiet and MSI does as we show
on our teardown contact some of the
power components with at least they're
all pads connected to the fins of the
heatsink so you're getting some level of
transfer some nominal level of transfer
between the vrm components and the
heatsink which is better than for
example the zotac amp extreme that we
looked at previously but it's just it's
simply ok it's not that exciting and you
know as a 10-7 ETI
for the price it's not bad you can find
better but it's also not the worst thing
a messiah has ever made they we have we
have examples of that on the channel if
you're curious so yeah overall not too
exciting or disappointing either way it
is certainly warmer than the Vulcan X
I'm not sure what the Vulcan X is
selling out in the US has been in and
out of stock we'll be looking at me 1070
TI cards from EVGA it's somewhat soon
and hopefully one of them ASIS but other
than that we've got some of these tricks
and power colored Vega coverage coming
up sometime hopefully before CES but
we'll see the Intel bug is throwing us
off a bit that video should already be
