Nexus Donna and I am here at cyber
powers super-secret offices in
California and we are looking at an NZXT
s340 we've got some other cool
components in here I'm gonna run you
through them this is actually a custom
s340 and this is all built using cyber
powers set up on the website of course
so first of all for the chorus pecs the
big thing on everyone's mind is the GTX
980 which is Nvidia's brand new GPU and
it uses the GM 204 GPU you can check out
the full review and the links in the
description below for that it's insanely
powerful it's the fastest GPU I've ever
ever tested and then for the board we
have an SOC force by gigabyte and in
there for the CPU there's a 4790k which
is The Devil's Canyon CPU and that will
overclock about 10% because of thermal
concerns that's kind of the safe limit
if you want to do more on your own
you're on your own for the cooler
there's a CLC it's NZXT Zechs 61 which I
have written about before so check the
website for that it is a 280 millimeter
CLC and that is cooling our our CPU Ram
we have 32 gigabytes of HyperX fury and
fury is it ships at 1866 megahertz they
have a savage line that's coming out
soon that will ship I believe at 2400 or
2133 and then for the SSD there is an
Intel 730 not sure how much space
probably a lot because it is a pretty
good SSD some kind of zxe power supply
near hidden by the shroud of the s340
and as far as the case the s3 40
normally ships in a black white
configuration and CyberPower has a
custom version they've got an orange
backplate here for hiding the cables and
the shroud when it this is a
pre-production model when the shroud is
complete it will be orange as well
there's also a black red version that is
coming out under cyber powers branding
only available on their website of
course so that is the s3 40 pretty cool
case we've written about it check that
out it's basically the h4 40 but a bit
smaller no plastic parts NZXT is trying
to move away from plastic which is
something that we are greatly
appreciative of and in addition to the
case setup there is a
a multicolored LED strip that comes with
the system when you buy it this is very
similar to something I showed you with
BS mods Bob Stewart who does a lot of
pretty high on case mods at trade shows
and it's it's pretty similar to that
it's a bit cheaper and you don't have to
build all this stuff like he does so
what you do with this is just hit the
different colors and it will change
those colors it's got an IR detector in
there that's not detecting right now
there we go
so it'll change all the different colors
on the remote and it's just just some
style stuff for your system and yeah
that's the setup check the links in the
description below for all the pricing
full article and all that stuff see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
