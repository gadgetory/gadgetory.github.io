that didn't deserve their own separate
videos one is Andy's n there's a bunch
of news on that at my sort of IDF next
door anyway and then Nvidia now has a
GTX 10 CC with 3 gigabytes of VR am
officially this time not just a rumor so
we'll be talking about that in a second
first this content is brought to you by
i buy power and their new element gaming
PC which has the red LED underglow arc
LED fans a large tempered glass side
window so you can look at all of the
LEDs first off with AMD the Zen
architectures of course the new
architecture coming up it is replacing
sort of the vchera bulldozer excavator
all those chips are going to be AOL as
zen roles in the main ship that we've
seen a few times now and was shown
officially at the sunnyvale while san
francisco event by the sunnyvale company
it is the eight-core 16th red chip so it
is an smt chip it's got simultaneous
multi-threading which is basically what
Intel hyper-threading as they've sort of
rebranded it and changed a few things
but same idea where you've got eight
physical cores 16 threads that was on
display at this event and in and II
showed a 40-percent IPC gain
instructions per cycle which is
something they've needed to compete in
performance with Intel and hopefully
reach parity if not exceed Intel's
current gen performance so that was
shown the forty percent gain there were
also some architecture unveils for Zen
and this was demonstrated through the
eight core 16th red chip and through a
server chip called Naples which is a 32
core 64 thread chip that is a server
chip again it's not something you'll use
in a gaming PC they had two of those in
a server board so sort of like a old
skull trial set up so I was just server
22 cpu motherboard so that was
demonstrated and some of the
architecture information revealed for
summit ridge which is the eight core 16
thread one that we're mostly looking at
increases the issue with an execution
resources by 1.5 x over excavator and a
1.75 x increase in the instruction
scheduler window over excavator as well
single thread performance improves by
greater instruction level parallelism
and AMD still drives a big focus on
integer units so this is something that
Andy's always been pretty big on energy
units over a floating-point obviously
there's still floating point half the
block diagram is floating point but
integer units specifically were shown at
this event and we can see that there are
four al use to AG use and the latter of
which pipe into the load/store queue Zen
can perform two loads and one store with
each cycle and caches in a 32 k 8 way d
cash the FPU side of the chip runs to
multiplying two ads for floating-point
operations with a single scheduler
flanked by the FP rename and FP register
file we'll talk about this more in the
future probably in our design review
once we get there and explain what all
this stuff means cash is mostly unified
now so there's eight megabytes of l3
cache shared and then the l2 cache is
also unified for instruction use so that
is a big part of these IPC gains caches
it plays a huge role on TP performance
especially with certain types of modern
games so that's one of the big news
items it is 40 nanometer FinFET same as
sort of the Polaris lineup and that
means that all the same power efficiency
gains native to that process node are
going to be yielded pretty much in Zen
clock gating is still there and AMD also
showed a clock for clock blender
performance which is a rendering and
animation tool so they showed clock for
clock performance versus an i7 broadwell
each ship at eight cores 16 threads so
same corn thread count obviously
completely different architectures so
not perfectly linear and clockwork
locked not necessary perfectly linear
but andy claimed that they were
outperforming intel in this specific
application with blender presumably for
render times finally summit ridge will
launch on the am for platform which is
brand new it will be replacing the am3+
platform and the FM platform so ap use
will no longer be on their own platform
which is actually a really good thing
probably as long as they all function
fine but the good part of it is if you
buy one motherboard you can use it for
either AP use or Zen CPUs as long as
it's 7-10 ApS so obviously the upgrade
pathway is clear if you wanted to kind
of my great one board down and use it
for an eight
you set up then you could do that so
that is am for Bristol Ridge will
function an am for if you have read
about that architecture that processor
and system integrators will be shipping
am for systems starting in the second
half of this year very soon and
hopefully we'll be reviewing it so and
these moving to am for which has modern
support for pcie gen3 USB 3.1 and ddr4
native support and say to express
support so it's completely updated nvm
ease also they're all those issues with
am3+ will be resolved at am for the next
bit of news is about the GTX 1063
gigabyte card we don't have one yet
nvidia is not sampling media this time
so I've got some on the way through
board partners and we'll be reviewing it
but basically it's a three gigabyte card
it's not the same as the 1060 those
specs are changed a bit so they've
disabled one sm or simultaneous
multiprocessor you look at a block
diagram with the card for the 1066 ii
goodbye you'll see 10 SMS and one of
those has effectively been turned off so
that means with 128 cores per SM we go
from 1280 cuda cores on the 1066
gigabyte down to 1152 cuda cores on the
three gigabyte card so that's one of the
big changes that will impact performance
certainly the clock rate is the same on
the three gigabyte and six gigabyte
models and that's the sort of 1517
hundred megahertz clock rate that we've
talked about before other than this
frame buffers different TMU count is
down a bit coup de coeur count is down a
bit clock rates the same and the frame
buffer is half so that's the main update
with this card in the past the most
we've seen these vm changes impact
performance have been in very specific
applications Assassin's Creed syndicate
black ops 3 with certain settings
Mirror's Edge catalyst with certain
settings things like that not every game
will reflect the change but some of them
do I don't know if this is sort of
correlation is not causation thing but
often gameworks titles we see a change
so that's something we'll be talking
about and video claims a five percent
Delta between the three and six gigabyte
cards but a fifty dollar price gap I'm
not sure how it'll actually work because
you're still removing ten percent of the
cores so that ten percent with a five
percent reduction
seems weird so we'll be testing that and
Nvidia is also claiming claiming a
performance gain over am these are x48
gigabyte card of ten percent so will
validate that as well but if they're not
sampling so I'll make sure we get some
whether I have to buy it or otherwise
availability will begin in the next
couple weeks for the three gigabyte card
it will be two hundred dollars MSRP
we'll see what it actually lands at but
that's fifty dollars reduced an MSRP
from a 60 k by model and that's that's
really all there is to it so we'll see
we'll see how it works the driver update
was pushed today so that will make cards
function once they're out there board
partners are starting to send them out
so we'll have news for you on that and
on Zen as more news is available next
week there will be a Zen update as well
so we'll try and post some information
on that it will be about architecture
again thank you for watching as always
pay channeling cholesterol video for
information hit the links in the
description below we've got articles on
both of these news items already
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
