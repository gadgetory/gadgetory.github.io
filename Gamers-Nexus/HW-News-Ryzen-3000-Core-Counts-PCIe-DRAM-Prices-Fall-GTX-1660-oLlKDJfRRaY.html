news recap talking about well there's a
bit of stuff that we've confirmed at CES
some of the rumors that were in the
industry
getting circulated had some time to
speak with engineers and product
managers at CES and get some was
confirmed for you so we talking about
some of that today like the new NVIDIA
GPUs coming out that won't have r-tx
talking about again a.m. these products
X 570 we got some further confirmation
on that following our previous video on
the chipset and PCIe for consideration
so we were able to get that more
concrete for this week's news show and
then D Ram price is expected to fall
further throughout 2019 there's Nvidia
ten series isn't nearly entirely gone at
this point ice lake CP is showing up
with a cash upgrade things like that
some of this is new some of it's a few
days old but this is our weekly recap
for hardware news before that this video
is brought to you by mass drop and the
PC 37 X gaming headset with
professional-grade Sennheiser noise
cancelling microphone the PC 37 X
headsets are what we use in the office
for phone interviews where audio and mic
quality are critical making it very
convenient high performance solution for
gaming or professional work the
headphones come with a detachable
ten-foot cable for safe storage during
travel a standard 3.5 millimeter plug
and soft foam for firm but comfortable
fit over the ears the PC 37 X headphone
stand apart with high mic quality mixed
with high quality audio output learn
more at the link in the description
below
quick GN note first we just restocked a
a bit more of these so the copper Mule
mugs are on the store they're on store I
came from Texas Donna if you want to
pick one up it's got the thermal
conductivity of copper printed on the
outside of it and then a nickel liner on
the inside so you can drink your cold
beverages out of it and then we did
restock Raglan hoodies those have been
in high demand and the anniversary
designs shirt so all three of those
things have just recently been restocked
on stored I cameras XS net first a news
item this is gonna be a short one for
and the CPU core accounts and PCIe 4.0
on the PCH we had a news story talking
about some of this a couple days ago at
this point and let's start with the CPU
core accounts in speaking with some of
the same people who have informed our
other previously accurate stories as
we've we've gone through launch cycles
and I've been able
determine if our sources were accurate
this comes from some of those same
people where our understanding is that
and these plans for CPU core account
with the new generation rise in 3000
series it's a cat hair that came off my
shirt snowflake is is is here with us
apparently so our understanding the CPU
workout should be 1612 and then your
usual 8 for example 8 for whatever so
there's been a lot of talk about is
there going to be a 16 core and the CPU
our understanding is yes we don't know
anything else I don't know the TDP I
don't know anything about the cache or
the frequency cache you can probably
predict with fair accuracy frequency no
idea
so either way though our understanding
is that there should be a 16 core and a
12 core AMD CPU coming out in the
desktop series of Verizon processors
coming up later this year is just a
question of do tOA's come out at launch
in roughly June with the other with 8
core part or are they slated for later
but regardless of one the 16 and 12 core
parts come out our understanding is that
they are supposed to come out and it
will be in the rise in 3000 series
desktop lineup as opposed to just the
HTTP tr4 stuff so just wanted to confirm
that for you our we are we have pretty
strong confidence that's going to happen
unless there's some major change and a
indies lineup so despite having very
confidence that 16 and 12 core parts
will exist we just we don't know when
and of course AMD could change their
plans and so you know it's it's not a
rumor this comes from a trusted source
that works with these parts but it's not
Andy so keep that in mind we're pretty
sure it's gonna happen it's just give
yourself a little bit of room to be
disappointed if there's a delay or
something Nvidia or actually there's one
more thing on AMD first the PCH so we
were talking about PCIe 4.0 and so first
of all language correction I did say
chipset last time when I was talking
about migrating parts of epic to the x5
70 chipset epic on the sp3 platform does
not have a traditional chipset so the
correct phrasing would have been to say
migrating parts of epic itself said be
things
i oh like pci you 4.0 to the x5 70
chipset and so want to put out in a
language crack from there but the rest
of the content stands and the thing that
we've since confirmed with a couple of
people is that the x5 70 chipset
especially with its rough 15 watt target
not the lower 68 watt target of the the
current chipsets is probably going to
have PCIe 4.0 in the chipset and by
probably I mean almost definitely at
this point so that was something that we
were a bit wishy-washy on in the
original coverage where I said we really
couldn't confirm one way or the other
but since that story went up we have
gotten a couple of notes from I think
three different sources that said yes
it's it's gonna be PCIe 4.0 in X 570 so
wanted to update that in case you were
curious so another one this is another
rumor that's been out there that we've
been able to partially confirm so Nvidia
1660 GPU information has been going
around lately one aspect of the story I
haven't independently clarified with
people as the name 1660 avoided using
the name so that might we don't know but
it's probably 1660 Ti or something
whatever the current naming is you may
have heard of this referred to as the
GTX 1160 in the past same vein when
we're talking about either part though
so what we have independently confirmed
is we independently spoke with sources
in the industry and confirmed some of
the rumors that include for example a
drop of RT and tensor cores and the
upcoming lower skew series of Nvidia's
new GPUs we confirmed that the CUDA
cores are still moving to taurine
architecture so this is not a Pascal
refresh like we previously about eight
months ago speculated might happen so
it's not Pascal inventory it is in fact
updated silicon which is good but it
drops RT intenser cores and then we
further GN confirmed independently that
this isn't just a rebrand or anything
like that at least as far as we
understand it's supposed to be new
silicon so interesting things were you
there we we further confirm that the
1660 will be less powerful than the 2060
in ways other than just RT and tensor
cores and that's going to come down to
the coup de coeur account so the coup de
coeur account should be actually a bit
reduced
on the 1660 or whatever its name may be
at the end as opposed to the 2060 so
reductions in SM count is what you're
looking for there and it's all very
interesting it begins to reinforce some
of the other reports like there was
posted by techpowerup for example so we
were able to largely confirm a lot of
their stories with our own sources and
when you have multiple outlets talking
to to their own different sources then
you know it starts to look like a real
story and not just rumors so independent
validation there the interesting thing
though is that this deviates from some
of the expectations that were posted a
while ago the where people thought it
would be like a 2060 exactly except with
RT and tens of cores removed
it's clearly not that you're losing some
SMS as well and there might be some
other changes I don't know if the memory
change is gonna be if any but if Nvidia
did launch just a straight 2060 with no
Artie or tensor cores they're starting
to put a price on RT X and so I don't
suspect we should see a product that
similar because if you have a
like-for-like card that only disables RT
in tensor cores or just doesn't include
them in the silicon at all does it be
wasteful then then you're starting to
say okay this one's 350 and that one's
$300 the price of RT X is $50 so I don't
suspect we'll see that happen and Vidya
probably wants to avoid a scenario where
you can put a firm price on the the
value of RT X that should largely be a
subjective than it should be up to the
user and putting a cost on that is it's
not really beneficial for marketing and
ultimately the user should sort of
decide anyway so likely they will avoid
that scenario but an interesting thing
to think about next one DRAM prices are
expected to fall 20 percent throughout
2019 so we can perhaps start 2019 on a
positive note here with this one with
DRAM prices continually forecast as
declining we spent much of 2018 writing
about memory prices and for good reason
that said 2019 maybe the Year memory
prices reach or fall below where they
were in early 2016
DRAM manufacturers such as Samsung and
SK Hynix have already announced plans to
cut capital expenditure and
fashion in a bid to maintain prices
instead micron looks three following
suit
we've also mentioned that DRAM makers
could augment output to try and level
out the market which is an oversupply
presently despite this DRAM exchange a
reliable site where you can check the
pricing still expects demand to be week
with little signs of recovery throughout
the four quarters of 2019 as such prices
are expected to slide quarter by quarter
with as much as a fifteen percent drop
in first quarter 2019 however the fact
that the big DRAM players have so much
influence over the market is concerning
especially when prices are returning to
normalcy and there was a report on PC
Gamer by Paul Lilly who felt similarly
and reached out to Avril Wu an analyst
at DRAM exchange and found the received
the following quote even though DRAM
manufacturers have revised their 2019
capex downwards slowing down the
capacity expansion we still believe that
memory prices would continue to drop in
2019 particularly the prices of consumer
DRAM would decline by over 20 percent
this year so even though there are still
some uncertainties in the market on the
whole prices are expected to keep
sliding which is of course much needed
at least in the enthusiasts audience
segment so good news there for you but
we need to see how that pans out over
the next couple months and Vidia claims
it's ten CDs inventory is nearly gone
not really much of a surprise we've
previously reported months and months
ago around the 28th e27 launch area that
the 1080p eyes were almost gone and in a
Q&amp;amp;A session Nvidia CEO Jenson Huang gave
an update on their self-proclaimed and
self-inflicted crypto hangover as he
previously called it
ventureBeat reports that when asked can
you tell us more about your problem with
excess inventory and how that will be
resolved that Wan responded as such
Huang said it's completely a crypto
hangover issue
remember we basically shipped no new GPU
in the market to the channel for one
quarter but the amount of excess
inventory and market demand channel
velocity you just have inventory divided
by velocity and that's time we said that
it would take one to two quarters for
all the channel inventory to
sellout 1080i has sold out 1080 has sold
out 1070 has sold out 1070 t.i has sold
out in several more weeks 10 60s will
sell out then we can go back to business
I think the world would be very sad if
Nvidia had never shipped another GPU one
said that would be very bad so yes I
mean certainly from at least his
perspective it would be but that was
their quote so Nvidia is is sold out of
1080i 1080 is everything down to 1060
and keep in mind that this doesn't mean
you can't buy cards with those dps in
them it means that Nvidia no longer has
silicon stock of those parts so it's a
bit different from their perspective
than from yours because you're you're
buying from you're buying completed
products so they may still be out there
on some retailers but you should not
expect more to be manufactured is the
takeaway from this and if his words are
anything to go by we can assume the end
of life of 10 series is nigh and they
can begin to push the 20 series a bit
more earnestly and start really
saturating the channel as much as
possible with the existing 20 series
cards even as Pascal heads into the
sunset here there are rumors swirling
that there's a potential taurine based
gtx card as we noted sans the RT course
and you can refer to a few minutes ago
for that so ice Lake CPUs have been
showing up in benchmarks online with a
potential cache upgrade a recent
benchmark shows Intel ice Lake CPUs with
double the l1 and l2 cache as can be
seen in the Geekbench and si software
Sandra benchmark databases these
benchmarks show quad-core chips clocks
at 1.38 gigahertz with a boost of 2.29
the chip is a low-power mobile part and
as Tom's Hardware points out most likely
is an engineering sample so frequency is
probably not final but still gives an
early look at what's happening the CPU
shows an l1 and l2 cache of 48 kilobytes
and 512 kilobytes respectively and this
is a significant upgrade from Intel so
long unchanged cache hierarchy as a
reminder ice lake will be based on the
sunny Cove architecture and Intel's 10
nanometer process node which has been
long awaited at this
Appl attributes' week iPhone sales -
repairs Apple stance against right to
repair is well-documented look at Luis
Robbins channel but they always stop
short of saying it hurts the bottom line
instead they prefer to talk in vague
terms and invoke talking points of
safety and security in a recent letter
to investors CEOs Tim Cook actually said
in more words than we're using here that
the repairs of iPhones were hurting the
bottom line in the latter Cook warns
investors that Apple would come
significantly short of revenue
expectations for final quarter 2018
mostly due to sluggish iPhone sales
Cooke offers a few different reasons for
the slump in sales but one in particular
is users hanging onto their older
devices after the throttle gate
controversy Apple tried to atone for
their sins by offering $29 battery
replacements which many iPhone users
took advantage of by replacing an older
battery this did two things it showed
many device owners that smartphones
don't come with a two-year expiration
date and simple repairs can keep a
device running like new for many more
years secondly have forced Apple to
admit in Apple's own way mind you that
planned obsolescence and avoiding user
repairs is important for iPhone sales we
don't really talk about Apple very much
or even smartphones or frankly kind of
boring but these kinds of points are
interesting as they relate to rights
repair and pointless consumer cycling of
devices in an industry that's still
maturing with PCs its maturity hang out
to a PC for years at a time sometimes
five or more depending on how serious
you are about it and phones haven't
quite gotten to that point yet although
they're trending that way so we do hope
to see people hold on to their phones
for longer because it's just it's just
absurdly wasteful so it looks like it is
going that way though just because
there's so much news this week let's go
through a couple and kind of rapid-fire
format so for rapid news here USB type-c
will get a new verification protocol the
USB if' group announced that USB type-c
authentication procedures will begin
soon this new program is primarily aimed
at resolving issues of uncertified
cables USB type-c cables and issues of
security so something to keep an eye out
for a GPI maintains a narrative that
storing the Internet freedom order as
has benefited consumers so AGP FCC
chairman and his administration we're
responsible were getting net neutrality
rules last year and this achievement is
something that is tremendously proud of
recently pi said that he was pleased
that a strong bipartisan majority of US
House of Representatives declined to
reinstate what he called heavy-handed
internet regulation
Ars Technica I went digging for more on
this and got a quote from deputy
director Evan Greer of the advocacy
group fight for the future and Greer
said as usual what Ajit pie is full of
it and further said this is a direct
quote his claim that broadband speeds
are up is the tech policy equivalent of
it's snowing outside
therefore climate change is a hoax so
ARS technica has an article with an
interview with mr. Greer if you're
interested
another quick news item ARPANET director
and internet pioneer dies at 81 so our
vennett was essentially the first
Internet and it came with the creation
of the tcp/ip stack that is still the
backbone of the Internet we enjoy today
it had many important names attached to
it with Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn being two
of the more prominent
however Larry Roberts is perhaps a
lesser known but equally important
contributor he was the program manager
and director at Advanced Research
Projects Agency along with his team they
created ARPANET in 1969 which would
later become the foundation of the
Internet Roberts died on December 26th
at the age of 81 so poor went out for
the Roberts kids without him probably
wouldn't even be delivering this to you
today
and also cat gifs so it's done quite a
lot for this world some of them more
important than others like cat gifs for
example another one windows 7 users put
on notice
AOL is soon so officially eol this time
looks like January 14th 2020 if you're
on Windows 7 Microsoft will stop
updating and then there's been news
about and Intel I $9.99 9 t x ee that is
not me miss speaking that's actually
going to be the name 14 core part base
frequency 4.0 5.0 boost so that'll come
out at some point probably but
mostly exclusive to system integrators
the ACLU's auction we might get one I'm
not sure that's it for this week as
always you can support us directly by
going to store that Cameron's exes net
if you want to pick up for example one
of our new mule mugs Moscow Mule mugs or
our Raglan 2-tone hoodies and you can
also get a patreon.com/scishow sexist
