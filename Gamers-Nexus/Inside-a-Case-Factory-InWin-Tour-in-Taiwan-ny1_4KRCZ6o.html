factory one of them in near Taipei
Taiwan this is a pretty cool machine I
wanted to show off so this is part of
the plastic injection molding process
for making the cases I have plastic
components on them we've seen some of
the metal component metal machines
already and those are it's everything
from sanding to CNC machines and things
like that this deals with the plastic so
what we have here is basically a
four-step process the first step starts
back here and that is where the plastic
components are input originally the
plastic comes down and goes into an
electrically heated tube and that tube
is what helps prepare the plastic to be
shaped so that plastic then is brought
in here into this chamber you can see
it's moving now so this big chamber will
bring the plastic in close and press it
when it's heated and that action of
course shapes the plastic to be whatever
shape the panel needs it to be whether
it's got holes in it or embellishments
or angles or whatever that happens here
and then the part that's moving around
up above me that comes over it reaches
an arm down and grabs the plastic piece
then pulling that up and bringing it
back over to my left right now it brings
it that way at which point it is dropped
onto a conveyor belt and the conveyor
belt moves it down to a factory worker
an actual person who goes throughout the
process of cleaning it up and preparing
it to be placed into whatever pallet
needs to be placed into prior to being
applied to the case which is then of
course shipped to you so now we're gonna
look at the rest of the factory with
b-roll of all of the machines at work
and this will be all voiceover
commentary from here this next machine
we're looking at is pretty cool but it's
something that you may have seen in the
US or wherever you're from because it's
somewhat standard this one is a manual
CNC machine it is used to cut out shapes
and effectively form the metal that
you're looking at here in this example
and they also have a drill bit
attachment it's basically a drill bit it
can mill a hole into the metal that the
operator is currently working on so this
can be used to create small tools or
molds or things like that that will be
used later for production purposes and
in wind does make a lot more than just
they've got some samples around their
workspace their lab for buttons and
things of that type another tool in the
same room was the sanding machine and
this is another one that may be somewhat
familiar
so this functions in two ways first of
all the operator places the object to be
sanded on the surface and it is a
magnetic surface so the object won't
move around they then turn the sander on
and that begins spinning basically a
giant wheel to grind down the service to
be however smooth that they want it to
be and then the table rocks the piece
back and forth to assist in that motion
where you get these sparks flying
of course this generates a lot of heat
which can impact the efficacy of the
sanding process so the machine sprays
water on the piece being sanded to cool
it down so that it may continue to be
efficiently and effectively sanded by
the Machine and as with most factories
there's also a quality control lab and
this one had some pretty cool stuff that
we actually got to see in action one of
the first machines we saw here was the
3d coordinate measuring machine and that
was next to a projection machine so
these two work in conjunction to
basically check the very fine
measurements of whatever tool or part of
a case is being made the 3d coordinate
measuring machine uses a scanning head
as you'll see in our footage here and
that is controlled by a joystick by the
operator the operator can use the
joystick to navigate basically like a
d-pad and that scanning head will get
closer to the object and it can measure
or apply changes as needed the next
piece is the projection machine and this
one is where you put the object into the
bottom of the machine as you can see
here and all it does is project it
larger onto the display that's at the
top of the machine at about head level
so that the operator can inspect the
object being quality tested and make
sure that it meets the very specific
measurements as required by the
manufacturing documents some other cool
things we saw in the in wind Factory
were these really large press machines
and these do exactly what you may think
they do you take a sheet of metal and
they can press the shapes and so there's
two different types of these that we saw
in their factory one was a stamp and
this functions as
just slamming down and stamping out the
hole that is required and this may be to
form for example a screw or a bar that's
used in one of the fancier cases that in
winds got and so there's these stamp
machines they stamp out cut the shape
and then the press machines which sort
of come down with a huge amount of force
and press the metal into whatever shape
is required by the company now these
also will stamp out holes so the stamp
machines can cut out there's little tiny
hex patterns that you'll see in some of
the cases like the in wind 303 and these
hex patterns are created by just milling
a hole into a piece of sheet metal over
and over and then they later go through
a bending process the bending machine is
pretty cool as well the piece of already
pressed or stamped metal is fed into the
machine at which point based on the spec
input by the operator the machine will
then bend the metal into the shape
required and that may be something like
an L shape for a standard PC case or
something like that now towards the end
of this area there's the assembly line
and that is exactly as it sounds the
assembly line is where the technicians
who line the conveyor belt will assemble
the pieces with whatever documentation
they're given for that particular day
the particular component being made
whether it's a case or something else
and this is where they actually will
hand screw in all the screws the rivets
bolts and get it together packed and
ready to move on down the lines of
shipping or wherever it may go next and
normally one of the places that these
products will go of course is the powder
coating area and this was pretty cool as
well so this powder coating for paint
isn't a brand new factory for n when we
were one of the earlier tours and that
means that it wasn't really fully
populated just yet so what you're seeing
here is not what it'll look like in a
couple weeks time as it ramps up into
production one thing we did get to do
though was see the powder coating in
process and that was pretty fun so what
happens is first a technician operator
will take the piece of material whatever
it is side panel or a front panel top
panel whatever and they'll bring it into
a booth where they spray it down with
effectively a giant compressed
air gun and that evacuates all the dust
from the room so that the material can
be worked on without any dust
interfering with the paint so that gets
all the dust off of it
once it's sprayed off and hosed down
with this air they'll place that piece
onto a large ceiling mounted conveyor
belt and that is very very slowly almost
in a creepy fashion brings the component
into the giant paint booth and it just
keeps on rolling straight through and
ever stops goes through the paint
normally white or black right now and
that paint is sprayed on by several
cannons on the sides of the walls and
you'll notice there are these giant
filters as the component emerges from
the paint area the filters are sucking
in all this paint and this was important
to us because we've got a camera at the
end of it so we were of course concerned
that some kind of paint would ruin the
camera but no it gets sucked into these
filters I asked how often they have to
change them because they were taking on
a ton of paint dust and we were told
actually what they do is about every 35
seconds they will just drop a ton of
that dust straight down into a pan which
is later cleaned out so this was a
pretty fun process to look at and once
it's done I think we were told that the
this particular part of the factory can
take on more than 200 case components or
cases simultaneously through the
conveyor line and that pretty much sums
up what we saw in Huan's factory very
cool stuff we'll be looking at a couple
more while we're here near Computex
computex is next week one of the other
final things in the in--when area was of
course their showroom and they told us
while in the showroom that there will be
three new cases unveiled at Computex and
we will be there to cover them as they
come out that will include the D frame
version to the X frame version two and
another new case which was not disclosed
so check back for that coverage we will
be looking at that next week at Computex
as always patron compostable video and
helps out directly thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
