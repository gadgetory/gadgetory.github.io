can see it's shining a little bit of
light on well we could take the whole
thing and scale it a little bit and that
might kind of help make it a little more
visible oh also when I hit play then
make sure that playing to the location
of the camera not from the players start
that way we don't accidentally jump
around a location they don't really want
again so what I'd like to have happen
here to be able to walk up to this light
and just turn it on and off using the e
key right now when i hit a all the cow
blow up to let's fix that first i'm
going over to my project settings once
again you remember on my inputs we took
those action let's change that over to
our push that one key over and then
we're going to add a new action mapping
which i will call use
expand that what's actually set this one
to the e key so a little more
conventional so when you might have
actually seen in one two or five
thousand different names you might have
played now here's the deal our cows
Boughner we set up earlier week she did
we told that it should always be
listening out from inputs from the
player but general that's not how I
handle things it wouldn't be a lot more
I guess elegant with how you handled
inputs and how you pass them off between
different players so let's start there
let's set up our little waltz cons here
so that it can dynamically handoff
control to the player and take it away
and a common way to handle that is by
approximate only when the player is
close to something should they be able
to actually use it when they step away
from it they shouldn't be able to use it
anymore now it's pretty easy to set up
in blueprint it's affecting a lot of
ways it's very similar to how used to do
things in kismet if and you've ever
played with that that things like
trigger volumes and whatnot we're going
to do something really similar let's go
over to our components list and here we
could see the wall sconce leads to the
light component that makes it up chooses
list of components we're going to add a
box component now we're going to resize
this a little bit so we can move it
around freely we can scale it we have
all the same types of controls that we
have in viewport it'll make us a little
bit wider or something to be super wide
and pull that in just a little and will
kick up its thickness and then I'm going
to try to make it kind of flush with the
back of the light fixture it does not
have to be perfect this is necessarily
need to be an exact science but if you
get a lot of these overlapping you could
run into problems you want to keep this
clearly trimmed down to just the object
you want to interact with let's call
this essentially give us a
amzil rename it trigger perfect now back
over here in our crap we're not going to
worry about the construction script in
this case just to show off what the
construction script is doing is allowing
us to set some public variables for our
lights you see over here i have the
brightness that i can adjust and get
real time feedback you take the light
color and make that really anything we
want and that's because each time I make
a property change the construction
script is fire now in terms of gameplay
the construction script will only fire
the moment this is spawned when you play
and then it will never fire again so
it's a way for you to have some in
editor behavior as well as using the
event graph or your in-game name so in
terms of that let's take our trigger
which i just added a moment ago I'll
drag that in except let's not drag it on
I'm sorry we're just going to select it
over here the mindprint list right click
it at the very top you see we can add
events for it and one of these events is
called on the component begin overlap
which is a little bit of a mouthful but
what that means is when we have entered
the space of this volume when it is
overlapping with us we want to do
something on that note that reminds me
over in our components we want to make
sure that that trigger has some specific
collision properties an easy way to do
that is just change its preset will tell
it to behave like a trigger so it's just
that happens to be one of the names of
presets if you want to know what that
does if you're the kind of person says I
hate presets because I never know what's
going on in the hood all it's doing is
changing a series of checkboxes about
how you're going to collide with objects
already got a walk stuff are you going
to register overlaps and stuff what
types of objects do you want to collide
with a non collided and so on we're
going to use the trigger preset to save
a speed and then on our component begin
overlap we want something to happen what
we're going to do is we're going to
enable input we are going to tell this
light a when something steps into your
volume we want you to start listening
out for inputs and that's fine the note
said that's cool but where we're
listening to it was from it's going to
ask you to provide a player controller
now in my case I'm going to again cheat
for the sake of speed and we are going
to say get player controller and it will
feed us one by default this is hard code
into player index zero right now we're
we have a single player game so player
and x0 is perfect if you started having
multiple players there are some note
that you have access to that would allow
you to dynamically check which player
just entered into the volume and then
set your player controller accordingly
we're not going to worry about that in
this case so we have enabled input and
we can already kind of test this out we
just need to set up the rest of our
actual toggling behavior so remember
earlier we made that action input for
the use event so we slay that to the
inky so here I can right click and let's
type use and I get an event for that
just like we did earlier with the cow
self-destruct system so what we'll do is
just say when we hit this button we are
going to take our light component which
is point like to in this case and we are
going to toggle it
we'll plug that in like step and toggle
is going to go either way so that's fine
don't worry among other than that there
is one problem still remaining but I'd
rather show it to you to tell you what
it is so let's go ahead and hit play and
now I can walk up to the light actually
let's get way back here for starters so
I'm hitting the key key and nothing's
happening let's walk up to the light and
now when I hit the e key we can turn it
on and on but there's a problem now if I
get away from the light really far away
from light and still turn it on and off
that's because we enabled that in we
never disabled it we never told the
light to stop listening to the player so
let's do that really quick it's pretty
easy to do we need to select our trigger
right click one more time and this time
add an event this one will be called on
component and overlap so now we're
stepping out of the volume and what are
we going to do we are going to disable
input and just as before it's going to
say so who should we stop listening to
well I'll stop listening to that player
controller we set up a moment ago
compile play
and I hit from back here head
everything's just lock
any question on excuse me any questions
about this so far yes sir
so at it at this time there's not that
is something that we have been
discussing but I mean until we have like
actual plans on the table I can't really
talk further about it but it does get to
be compiled code so I mean it exists
somewhere we just haven't really gone to
that other step however the good news is
you have access to the source code so if
you want to go ahead and write that for
us then you totally do that we probably
really appreciate it though I'm so sorry
I'm supposed to repeat the questions
back and I get carried away the question
was do you have access to the whatever
the blueprint is doing in code meaning
like if I create a really cool blueprint
network can I see the code that gets
created under the hood and then make
changes to that the answer is at this
time no but it is something we have
discussed a little bit here and there I
just I can't really promise anything
until we have a plan right were there
any other questions and I will try to
repeat things yes sir not the other way
around if you start a sequence of
project you get any other visual aspects
so if you didn't hear that the question
was it can you work the other way you go
from code to blueprint and the answer is
yes that's actually what we do a lot of
the studio so programmer can go in and
create a class that can be fairly
generic and then start exposing elements
of that class by a blueprint and then
you can use those bug those hooks if you
will and change them around so one of
the things we do for instance is a you
know the designer will go to a
programmer say I need a generator that
allows me to create power to power these
things but I'm not quite I don't care
about what model is going to be attached
and so on so the program will create the
very basic behavior in a generic class
expose the hooks that need to be changed
by an artist to blueprint so the artist
who knows nothing about program you can
go in and make their records and changes
and turn it
and they want any other questions yes
sir so when should a gameplay element B
and blueprints what should it be in C++
that's always going to be like a
question right so the good news about
blueprint is it becomes compiled code
you're looking at speeds they're very
similar to what you saw with unreal
script so just like with any scripting
language on well script included once
you start having to get really low under
the hood like individual physics
calculations like let's say you're doing
a vehicle I wouldn't necessarily do a
vehicle in blueprint because you need a
lot of dynamic access to stuff going on
in physics so at that point I would be
reaching for C++ code for most other
things things that tend to run more
asynchronously use blueprint whenever
you can I mean it's going to remain
super fast super performant you can make
entire games in it again because it is
in effect a compiled scripting language
sir
can't blueprint reach out and touch a
mysql database where you have basically
handles i was trying to dig through all
of the nodes that i know from blueprint
and there's like thousands and thousands
there's not a native one bit would be
really easy to create you would just
create your class that handled your your
sequel database and then you just expose
the hooks that are artists needed say
for instance they need to populate that
with an array you would make that array
public and accessible to blueprint they
can now bring in that know they can
execute what it fires and they can now
feed an array into it and start setting
stuff out the database that make sense
cool any other questions yes sir
so unreal engine 4 can run on pc and mac
we're not calling a unique add any more
just and I'm only saying that because I
want to make sure I understand what
you're saying so unique a is still a pc
product on religion for is pc and mac
any other questions yes sir
oh so what do you do about the c++ code
on Matthews Xcode yes I'm noticed a lot
of people Mac does have an IDE okay
sorry i'll try not to troll the back
users any more than that attitude today
I need anything else all right yes sir
but multiple people so we can do that in
a village before the same way we could
it on religion 3 you would use something
like level streaming and make each
artist responsible for a specific
section of a level that gets streamed in
individually and when you're done if you
need to reevaluate how things are
strained in of course you can say take
this part that the artist was building
that was stream and now let's make it a
permanent part of this level and maybe
reevaluate how everything else get
stringed in but that's generally how we
do it right you'll take a level bust it
up into certain sections or in some
cases certain tasks like your you know
your high-end final look artists who may
just be going in and adding bits of
foliage or decals here and there and
they're all going to have their own
stream levels that represent what
they're working on and they can work on
all those at the same time at any point
you can just reload the map and ever all
changes this have been saved out come
right in anything else all right well
that hits us pretty much right to the
mark I want to thank all of you guys for
attending please be sure to get your
hands on a religion for if you haven't
yet remember that once you subscribe
even just one time what you get is yours
to keep and will not magically stop
working so you have really very little
excuse to not get your hands on these
tool to start making Navy with them
thank you all very much enjoy
