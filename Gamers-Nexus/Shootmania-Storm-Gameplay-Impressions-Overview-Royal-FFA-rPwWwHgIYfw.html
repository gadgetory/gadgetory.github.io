nexus donna and today we are playing
shootmania storm which is a sweet new
twitch shooter game in the style of
quake and unreal and this one's a bit
different from those it is it's very
fast just like them except you only have
one weapon and we're going to talk about
that in a moment it does what what
happens here is because you only have
one weapon there's no you know
counter-strike style by system there's
no I don't know there's no unreal pickup
system you need to be very good with
that weapon and you also need to be very
fast and very good at dodging because
you only have a couple hits and then
you're out for the round so because this
game only gives you one weapon and
because you only have four charges of
that basically plasma cannon before it
cools down it takes a bit of strategy
and a lot of aim to figure out where and
when you need to place your bullets to
take out your current or multiple
enemies and what eventually happens is
the player who is the most dexterous and
most able to think on their feet and
dodge the incoming rounds is the one who
will probably win so we are currently
spectating because I joined in the
middle of around this is actually this
is the first round of the map so that's
convenient all these players right now
are getting squished toward the middle
of the map by this storm you see on the
outline edges of it so the way this
happens at the beginning of the round
some player captured this pole in the
middle that we're looking at right now
it's effectively capture the flag type
thing except in a free-for-all format
once someone has captured that pole they
initiate the storm which is on the
outline edges of this arena the storm
slowly compresses players toward the
center of the map eventually eliminating
those who are caught in it and obviously
forcing them to fight so it keeps rounds
very short and very and just really you
know off the flying off the cuff so
you do get a ton of points for capturing
the pole however everyone kind of Wow
take that guy out pretty fast everyone
kind of convergys toward the center and
goes for it because of the amount of
points you get so I'm going to stay on
the outskirt of the map until the storm
has been initiated that sort of gives me
a chance to get more points through
other means like killing players or out
surviving them and the game actually is
it's very challenging in in these free
for all matches this this is called
royal this game mode there are a couple
other game modes and then there are a
good deal of unofficial game modes that
players have made so basically you only
have two shields you have two hits and
you're out and this is actually a
healing pad right there I need to get
moving because that storm is closing
them two hits you're out and if you
happen to die before the pole is
captured which is to say very early in
the match then you end up getting to
respawn except you only respond with one
shield let me focus on killing sky for a
second so this is incredibly hard okay
so I won that round I gained thirty
eight points i'm pointing out the screen
as if you can see it again 38 points i
hit 16 people or got plus 16 rather for
hitting people and I out survived the
other 11 players which then doubles to
survival score of 22 because I was the
last man standing so that gets you quite
a deal more points we're going to ignore
some of the complexities of the scoring
system it's really not that hard to
understand but we need to focus on
gameplay before going into the the
numbers of the game so gameplay pretty
straightforward you want to hit players
there's some strategy in rushing the
pole because you get a lot of points for
triggering that and you also force a
conflict between yourself and all the
other players who have rushed
who are probably fairly good players but
there's also a strategy to stain toward
the outer edges like I did last nap you
saw how well that worked not always the
best because you may get eliminated and
then you didn't get points for the pole
you didn't get points for surviving you
just get screwed all around however
there's also a strategy just to how you
shoot how you fight so we see in the
bottom left user interface is kind of
annoying but in the bottom left you can
see I have four charges for my plasma
cannon will call it currently down to
three and what happened to your ouch I'm
down to one shield now you can see that
in the middle bottom as well what
happens is as you shoot that initiates a
cool down and yeah this guy's good okay
so he won that round as you shoot it
initiates a cool down so if I fire four
rounds in rapid succession then I'm out
of shots for a good you know a couple
seconds which is actually a very bad
thing so as getting back to the original
point here of this of this monologue
their strategy to conserving your shots
and letting the enemy shoot their four
rounds and then trying to fire back at
them during their recharge so I hit him
once he's got one more shield again you
only get two shields so that makes it
very easy to die also makes for some
interesting dynamics when you and the
other player both have an equal exchange
and hit each other once because suddenly
both players are forced with the
decision you know do I play aggressively
or defensively right now I'm getting tag
teams here by two players but luckily
there's a healing pad right here so if i
do get hit as long as the storm is not
too close i can try to recover some of
that damage you can see he is doing that
right now that's the guy i hit earlier
anyway what's happening here
is the player who hits 200 points first
will win you get points in three major
ways by out surviving players oh that
was close by out surviving players by
hitting players and by capturing the
pole and then your points are doubled or
something like something crazy that you
get a good deal more points for winning
the entire match that's hits that's
points I got for hitting players that
survived I survived you know X many more
people and then pull in the middle
everyone gets a point for the round as
well I believe G is that guy does not
like me am I going on about here kind of
folk star not dying right now I'm gonna
run for the healing pad while I have a
second to break free and cuz losing a
shield so early is a massive detriment
if you end up caught in the final two
battle in the middle and you only have
one shield and he has to your I mean
yeah you better be a damn good shot and
speaking of being a damn good shot being
a twit shooter oh gosh again be nuts
Hood shooter the game realize pretty
heavily upon mouse control and upon your
ability to move on the keyboard you know
high DPI is kind of cool but I actually
play with low DPI in effort to better
control my mouse when I'm aiming and I
have found that that actually works
better that's a whole different
discussion let's see if this guy that
guy got eliminated by the storm I think
no he did not anyway comes down the game
comes down to your ability to aim and
once you have two players in the center
like this it's really just like a back
and forth kind of juking match whoever
can shoot the other guy first and trick
them into running a bullet or just
really spray and praying but that is not
so viable in this game because of the
four bullet cool down you think about
what else i can tell you about this game
so told you about the bullets told you
about the shield system the pole system
there's also an elite game mode this is
royal but i will show you the elite mode
in the future perhaps even in this video
depending on how time works out but how
elite is basically a 3 vs 3 juggernaut
match so think of it like your typical
juggernaut game like from Halo except
there are three players per team and
then there's a rotation one player each
round from one of the teams will be the
juggernaut versus three players from the
other team so you have red vs. blue say
red starts the rotation one of their
players will start as the juggernaut
they have quicker movements they get a
laser which is a different weapon I'll
tell you about in a second and they get
more hit points the other three players
are the from the competing team they
have the plasma cannons that everyone is
using in this match elite is kind of the
going competitive mode right now Ubisoft
is pushing that one heavily for
tournaments i believe they run weekly
and monthly tournaments normally with
prizes up to a couple hundred dollars in
the case of the alienware tournament up
to a couple thousand dollars and so
that's the gist of elite Royal is this
mode and then we also have some
player-created modes called obstacle
which is very cold at an entirely
different video obstacle is basically
your ability to move quickly through a
course that is not competitive in a
combat sense but competitive in a speed
sensor sort of like platforming really
what's our other mode battle is another
player made mode battle is a basically a
team domination style set up but it is i
don't think it's official and then
finally we have joust which is an
official mode and joust is basically a
1v1 rotation knockout format so you go
head-to-head with another player and
then whoever wins that match stays in
fights the next player you get knocked
out until your turn which is normally
within a couple minutes max so that's
joust now I said I would tell you about
the other weapons so right now we're
using the plasma cannon I don't really
know the proper name for any of the
weapons I will warn you but we know this
is a plasma cannon and oh yes there's
also a grenade launcher equivalent I
need to get away from the storm
goodnight launcher equivalent and a
sniper rifle which is basically a
railgun three players okay so ones over
there once in the other corner got him
yeah yeah I know I stopped talking again
but it's for a good reason as you can
see because this is totally playing for
money right now that's how good we are
I'm conserving my shots i'm going to try
and do a burst fire yep it was worth it
so there's that strategy in saving up
your ammo as i told you just kind of
shooting one every few seconds is good
to keep them suppressed I hid behind the
pole let him fire off his shots and save
them I for and then rapid fired at him
I'm actually in contention for first
place I'm in second right now goes to
200 points anyway multiple of weapons so
plasma cannon you have a railgun which
is a railgun is basically a one-hit kill
sniper rifle that's a hit scam meaning
there's no like there's no
traditional leading the shot it's it you
shoot wherever your cursor is it hits it
no delay so that's the other weapon it's
one shot before the cooldown on like
this plasma cannon which is four shots
and then there's a grenade launcher
equivalent that I think is two shots
before they cool down and has a massive
AOE damage effect so that is a pretty
sweet weapon the way you get those is by
going to different pads or buildings in
the game so you see here we have these
healing pads you can step on something
very similar to activate the sniper
rifle on certain maps and that gives you
a pretty good advantage if you have a
vantage point a big disadvantage if
you're bad shot because you only get one
shot and then it cools down and they'll
probably kill you before you can respond
the grenade launcher is activated by
going into a bunker and also some
strategy to that because you can get
trapped in those pretty easily storm
will take you out where other players
but the advantage of having an AoE
weapon so right now I'm in second it's
between me and him basically these other
guys we won't even talk about them let's
go into 200 points and first there will
win so I'm gonna stick to my strategy
right now on this map of about surviving
and of hitting players I'm going to kind
of avoid the pole I captured it once
earlier but that was risky and it's
really it's not trivial to get a pole
with so many good players so I'm going
to hang out get free points basically
for surviving and then rely on hitting
four more points not quite as free see
if this guy comes out of there
she that was close all right so i need
to go heal before the storm gets closer
and cuts off the healing pad and this
will give me a pretty this will at least
equalize the playing field if it comes
down to me and another person in the
middle because as i said earlier you
want to have as much help as possible i
can hear a guy there he is and that
healing pads gone but it was well worth
it because i didn't die there in the
least i got an extra few points from him
it's down to three players you can see
in the bottom right the total current
player count who ran right into that and
now it's down to two players the guy in
first and someone else of course i am
rooting for someone else because i'm in
direct competition with the guy at first
but i'm guessing he will win he's a
pretty good player yep he wins so he had
185 points i will be at whatever that
plus that is and he's probably gonna win
at the end of this round at which point
we will end the video and jump to a new
video on elite or obstacle mode which i
really encourage you to check out
because those are some sweet game modes
it's really being that the game is so
focused on cash this guy's aggressive so
focused on player made content it is a
mania planet game if you're not familiar
with those they made the trackmania
nations and trackmania canyon games
there's a full map editor there's a skin
sdk of some kind so you can skin your
character i have a custom skin you'll
see at the end of this and you can even
create your own game modes which is what
obstacle and battle are so hugely
player-driven which i may not need to
tell you this but is awesome because as
the game ages you know every game is
going to eventually age and lose support
from its developer or publisher
officially this game you have the tools
to take it into your own hands which is
exactly what happened with trackmania
nations and really the developers as
important as they are they don't play a
huge role once it's out because the
players are able to create often better
for
better or more interesting maps and game
modes see if I can win this one I'm
gonna let them kill each other if
possible there are two other guys yeah
guy in first over there he remembers I
saved my shots last time he's doing that
to me now it's pretty bad to jump
because it's very predictable but you
can jump in speed boost which I have
somehow neglected to mention that's what
that bar bar in the bottom right is he's
gonna hit me I'm talking it's a speed
boost it's what makes you go so fast in
this game just like skiing and tribes
you have a limited speed boost say good
game good round and good fight limited
speed boost once you've used it it's got
a cool down just like the gun so that's
the other part of the skill so to wrap
the game up just this game mode at least
it's basically three parts one part
agility your ability to dodge one part
aim and uh where's me where is me great
grammar right there i am so there's my
custom skin on the far left you can see
that i was talking about one part
agility one part aiming and then finally
one part speed your ability to maintain
that momentum and keep flowing with the
map and that is probably one of the
harder things to learn but it is so
rewarding once you learn how to stay
moving at a really high speed because i
mean just like tribes it's you know it's
fun and you're hard to hit you get to
the pole faster all kinds of awesome
stuff like that so that is shootmania
storm this is the next map there are
quite a few maps they're all very good
except for maybe one check out the other
videos on the channel for the full
proper review that really explains
everything in more constructed format
rather than me just shout casting as I
play and get killed and check out my
videos on obstacle and elite modes which
will be coming very quickly after this
one so review will be published on the
psycho to gamers excess thought I'd
check that out follow us on twitter also
