have confused about half the internet
with its product positioning landing at
a one thousand dollar price point and
offering both gaming and professional
level performance but without any of the
professional level driver certification
this makes the card most immediately
analogous to a Titan XP and today we're
reviewing the Vega frontier edition most
heavily for thermal performance noise
versus thermals power consumption noise
stand alone and some smaller additional
tests on production and gaming workloads
before that this coverage is brought to
you by the core g21 enclosure from
thermal take a $70 case with two four
millimeters thick tempered glass side
panels mesh ventilation in the front for
breathability a rarity in cases these
days and a power supply shroud with top
mounted SSD sleds learn more at the link
in the description below again a large
part of our review we focus on noise
thermals and power because we think we
can cover those the most adequately and
with the greatest depth while hopefully
offering some unique insight to the card
but we do have some production and
gaming tasks in there and before anyone
starts screaming that this isn't the
gaming card there are a few things to
clear up about the Vega Frontier Edition
first of all for thermal power and noise
that's largely unchanging power does
change a bit with workload but by and
large when you look at the results that
we present here it will apply pretty
much everywhere so that gives a good
understanding of how the card will
perform in various workloads and also
gives us some insight as to Vega as a
whole as an architecture so that's
number one the second part is with
regard to product positioning we spoke
with AMD in length about the Radeon at
Vega Frontier edition cards unique
position in the stack the device isn't
quite a card targeted at the core gamer
audience but also isn't exactly a
professional class simulation card where
you would need to pay for driver
certification for assurance of accuracy
the Radeon Pro line is still reserved
for that side of the market which the
Radeon Vega f/e does not fall into as it
does not have those driver
certifications and that means that this
card is split marketed and again
speaking with an v about this at gaming
and developer applications this isn't
for scientific or compute users who
would be better served by fire pros but
in our conversation with the companies
they were big on the fact that it's a
pro ready card with drivers but that it
also has gaming
is packaged in similar to a Titan XP
except with more pro level optimization
that makes Vega Fe a very oddity card
indeed because it's positioned outside
of the professional scientific space no
certification no purchase but also
outside of the core gamer space just
like the Titan XT is that makes Vega Fe
almost directly comparable to the Titan
XP though again it does have some
additional changes in the pro area so
your typical buyer would be more likely
to be someone like a game developer who
creates content on a gaming class
machine and also needs to be able to
play to have stud content on the same
machine while keeping cost relatively
low certified drivers are expensive and
that's not an object if you're designing
an aircraft but it is if you're
designing a game and although both pro
applications are businesses there's a
big difference between I'm a game
developer and I design aircrafts that
could kill people if the simulation is
incorrect
which is where you would want the driver
certifications you would want the cards
that are certified for usage with
whatever CAD applications those might be
and when you're spending twenty thirty
thousand dollars on software anyway
something like a Quadro or fire pro card
doesn't seem so intimidating so the
places you would buy something like a
1080i or maybe rx Vega in the future
would be more for home freelance user
someone who's making money doing
freelance work on blender or whatever it
may be and can't justify the $1,000 plus
purchases but still want the performance
of a decent card that's the distinction
because even if you're just a game
developer who doesn't need those pro
certifications you can still make use
out of the more expensive cards it's
still a business expense buying
something cheaper probably cost you more
money in the long run anyway but there's
a good cost savings over something like
what Boeing might use for example so
that's kind of where the card is
targeted and that means that there are
some confused comments online some of
this I think can be drawn to the name of
the card Vega it has adopted the name of
the architecture which has been hyped
and discussed so long now particularly
in the gaming space because people want
high-end competition for NVIDIA gaming
cards that Vega F II has sort of become
the de-facto flagship card for Vega as a
whole the architecture and therefore is
being seen as a
Arta that could be a gaming targeted
device and much like the Titan XP is not
a good purchase for gaming when you
could consider something like a 1080p I
instead get very similar performance or
not much of a difference in really
anything except for price Vega F II is
not really meant for gaming but could
still be used to play games now the thin
AMD told us is that it's basically a
distinction of you develop things you're
a content creator and you also want to
be able to consume that content on the
machine whether it's to play test or
otherwise so that's the distinction now
as for the testing as always full
testing methodology will be in the
description below and the article we
have a lot of different test beds for
this one for power thermals gaming and
noise so those are all defined in the
article drivers are specified in the
article but they were the launch drivers
made available publicly by AMD as this
card was purchased and not a review
sample so it wasn't tested prior to
launch and that more or less goes over
all the basics now there's one more note
here overclocking we had some good
success with overclocking the core
originally but ran into some issues that
were either bugs with wot man or just
challenges that were not sure how to
overcome just yet the two primary issues
we ran into you were with HP m clock
speeds when overclocking the core and
with the fans beat so speak into these
we were able to get the core overclock
so something like 1670 megahertz we had
1682 fairly stable for a bit depending
on the application it crashed in a few
but survived and others ultimately
settled around 16 67 megahertz and the
problem was that the vram the HBM 2
seems to fall from 945 megahertz to
about 500 megahertz when doing any kind
of core clock change and wot man that
includes under clock in it so as a test
we dragged that bar down to negative 100
and the HBM readout I don't know if it
was actually an accurate readout but
through wot man the HBM readout said 500
megahertz when it was originally 945
even if you restored a default after
attempting any kind of change in watt
man negative or positive overclock on
the core
HBM would
we'll be stuck at 500 and would not
reset until rebooting the machine so for
that reason a lot of the performance
results with the overclocked version
we're actually lower than the stock and
that's because HBM was running lower
than stock quite significantly actually
so we only have one overclocked result
in here pretty far n to show that change
otherwise they've been eliminated until
we understand either what we need to do
to make it work or if AMD needs to roll
out an update there's we're not clear on
if it's an issue of this is a new card
we don't know how to work with it or if
it's an issue of wot man is buggy so
that's something to note now as far as
band speeds
once you ramp them up they're kind of
hard to ramp back down take several
minutes and the best way to fix it is to
basically go to auto fan speeds walk
away from it come back and then try to
only ramp up and not down because
ramping up is not much overcome also
there seems to be an offset of about 200
rpm on the wot man reading for the fan
speed and the actual reported fan speed
so keep that in mind as well but we
accounted for all that in the testing
all of that aside let's start with
benchmarking for power versus thermals
we're starting just with Vega and then
we'll add the Titan XP for comparison
under our thermal benchmark we measured
at the wall the Vega FB stock
configuration draws an average of 384
watts load with the overclock very in
drawing five to the two watts average
from the wall our peak power consumption
is for 42 watts during the stock test
and 569 watts during the overclock test
thermally we're averaging 79 nine
Celsius with the stock configuration and
7501 salties with the overclock
configuration accounting for ambient
which is lower because the fan is
manually controlled to 3,700 rpm in that
test
adding the Titan XP stock card we see an
average power consumption of about 357
watts so that's 27 watts lower than the
Vega EFI system the same test at a
maximum power consumption of about 370
dot 5 Watts about 72 watts lower than
the Vega FPU configs max power
consumption the Titan XP runs lower
power consumption overall but also hires
thermals and this has been a criticism
of ours since we first reviewed the
Titan XP and his resultant of the blower
design one item of note is that the Vega
EFI card has a much more sporadic clock
behavior as the clock rises and falls
frequently throughout testing we see
this reflected in the therm
and power lines while the Titan XP
remains more stable we're not yet sure
the connotation of this behavior and
aren't sure if the root cause is related
to Andy's execution of the software or
of the architecture
regardless we'll simply call it an
observed behavior for now this next
chart shows power draw and temperature
trend as plotted against a 22-minute
test run of spec view probe twelve which
performs trace based testing of 3ds max
Maya and other production applications
the spiciness in the chart is from test
starting and ending and they do so
through an intervals because they're
different speed cards with Vega Fe the
total system power consumption sits
reliably around the 425 watt mark pretty
consistently actually the few dips down
to 340 to 380 watts in the middle by and
large though we're at around 425 for
most of these tests adding the Titan XP
to the chart reveals its total system
power consumption at around 340 watts
for the initial quarter of past in and
around 396 to 4 or 4 watts for the
second half of the test they're all
performance for both devices is largely
mirrored in this specific test pass as
neither is permitted enough time to heat
up to throttle points between the test
execution for other power draw tests our
Vega Fe air system draws 381 watts in a
fire strike workload which is a delta of
40 watts more than the stock Titan XP at
the wall and a 1080 ISC to stock card we
also see a power draw of 401 watts and
Ghost Recon wildlands which is about 31
watts more than the Titan XP and 1080i
and for honor we're at 393 watts or
about 37 watts at more than the Titan XP
testing thermal performance
comparatively next with a steady-state
chart plotting noise normalized
performance at 40 DBA we see AMD's at
Vega EFI card operating at 59 9 DBA
ranking it alongside the worst gtx 1080i
partner card we've tested the armor
while still retaining a lead over the
reference to Titan XP card which is
saying something
these numbers are delta T over ambient
so if we account for ambient the Titan
XP was operating around 96 Celsius with
this 40 DBA output and clock throttling
as a result to be fair and II was also
clocked throttling on the Vega F II card
dropping about 9% off of its clock by
the end of the test which is certainly
significant but the point is that while
both of these devices can avoid clock
throttling by running higher
p.m. neither of them is quiet while
doing so this is precisely why AIB
partner models exist our liquid called
hybrid model the Vega app ecard will
further emphasize this shortly but to
provide perspective versus the AIB
partner 1080i cards which is when we
started using this testing methodology
and to their abundance we see a prime
example of noise efficient cooling in
the asus strix ROG card the gaming X
isn't far behind and blower fans in
general have just never really been good
at this particular task and that remains
true with Vega Fe that said big F II
does manage to retain lower temperature
at its noise level than the Titan XP
neither should really be run at 40 DBA
though and instead should be left to run
higher fan RPMs reduce clock throttling
still using our 40 DBA tests we're not
looking at MOSFET measurements on each
board with the hot spots measured with
thermocouples we see Angie Vega EFI hot
spot set around 50 4.2 Celsius delta T
over ambient switch although a few
degrees warmer than the armor is still
completely within operating spec for a
MOSFET remember that power components
can take far more heat than a GPU with
many supporting 125 or 150 C before any
major problems developed in this
instance we remain below a DC prior to
our Delta P calculation and that is
acceptable
speaking of board components let's take
a look at some of Vegas's component
temperatures under three different
states otto OC and a 3700 RPM fan to
prevent throttling and our 40 DB a noise
normalized config the GPU certainly runs
warm but is nothing out of the ordinary
for a blower card you see this
performance almost identically on both
end video and AMD blowers hence why we
normally recommend buying the AV partner
models for the frontier Edition though
it's between air and liquid units from
AMD right now we'd recommend a DIY
option as possible which is what we plan
to find out soon regardless about
temperatures in both our chores and hot
spots are well within operating range
the backplate itself which was measured
on the inside of the aluminum plate
opposite the top fat measurement
posted a temperature of around 61 to 65
Celsius which means that the card gets
physically hot to the touch when it's
running but just don't touch it when
it's on I guess this next chart shows
fan noise at each rpm measured in 10%
increments at a significant milestone
like lowest duty cycles and average duty
cycle for auto of note the Vega EFI card
tends to auto spin at around
40 to 41 percent in our bench setup with
a Titan XP spending out around fifty to
fifty-five percent of its total fan
speed in our set up keep in mind that
the fan sizes and speeds are different
so these percentages mean different
things for each device the Vega F II
card can spend up to forty nine hundred
rpm for instance so it's forty to forty
one percent
Auto is around two thousand rpm this
place is Vega Fe at around forty seven
DBA output in its average Auto
configuration with a Titan XP at around
forty seven to forty 7.9 DBA output in
its average auto configuration these two
are pretty darn close the noise output
when configured to their auto stocks and
curb matching them and noise output is
the best way to see a side-by-side but
we kind of already did that in the
previous noise normalize charts before
getting the fire strike and gaming let's
start with a few production tasks we're
using a spec view per for 3ds max my
Acadia and creo testing between the
Titan XP and Vega EFI card primarily
these tests were conducted in Pro Mode
because Vega is targeted at content
creators who game these choices make the
most sense and are adjacent or inclusive
of our core audience without going off
the deep end in production tasks we'll
leave that to our friends at Tech gauge
when they get their review up 3ds max
positions the Titan XP at 170 5.9
weighted mean fps during its bench pass
with the Vega EFI card 17% behind at 140
9.3 FPS with the CAD modeling software
cRIO AMD trades places with Nvidia and
leads with 90 4.4 FPS while the Titan XP
runs at around 60 or about thirty six
point eight percent behind Vega F II the
tide turns again with maya where nvidia
now operates a commanding lead at 145 f7
FPS and Vega at 139 for deficit of 22%
versus nvidia finally Cadia another cad
solution has Vega in the lead at 150 2.3
vs one 13.5 for the Titan XP a
commanding lead in this case for Vega
we have other tests that we want to run
but we'll revisit that topic later we
finally did get blender working after
working directly with one of the cycles
coders from the blender foundation to
troubleshoot issues with system hands
and blue screens finally using the build
at 2.7 8-9 cd6 b03 we were able to get
the render to complete on Vega and on
the Titan XP which had been completing
no problem already we've been in comms
with them throughout to troubleshoot
further but for now we've actually got
finished charge to look at this shows
that power thermals and time to complete
the render all-in-one the Titan XP
finished this render in fifteen point
one minutes which is why its wine ends
sooner and the Vega card finished the
render in nineteen point eight minutes
for a thirty-one percent longer duration
this was with tile sizes at 256 by 256
though the latest OpenCL optimizations
in blender ensure that the GPU should
remain at one hundred percent load
regardless of pile size in the future so
we optimize for the GPU with 256 by 256
anyway thermally the Titan XP sits at 45
percent fan speed for a noise output of
43 DBA and they sustain the operating
temperature of 73 Celsius Vegas it's at
roughly 2000 rpm Auto fan speed for a
noise output of roughly 47 DBA and
steady state temperature of 80 to 81
Celsius power consumption on Vega
averages roughly 390 watts total system
power drought while a Titan XP average
is 323 watts
total system power draw both Nvidia and
Andy maintain their clocks of 1848 and
1600 megahertz respectively throughout
the entire test so there's no thermal
throttling going on with either even
with the auto fan we can't definitively
state that this performance will apply
to all blender renders given the
differences in material types and types
of workload that blender can produce but
the cycles renderer with our benchmark
performs this way your mileage may vary
this gives a good early indicator of
course there's still room for blender to
update further getting to gaming and
synthetics we first start with fire
strikes to provide a baseline for
performance with fire strife ultra we
see Vega EFI plays at 4906 points when
stock which ranks at about 2.4 percent
behind the GTX 1080 founded Edition card
with gtx 1070 founders edition cards at
about 15.6 percent behind Vega FP
aftermarket models will obviously score
higher but we're focusing on reference
for today compared to a 1080 TI Vega EFI
is about 27% behind the 1080i reference
card and about 30 1.7 percent behind the
1080i gaming ex-partner model just to
illustrate the type of games you would
see with the partners if you had them as
for similarly priced Titan XP cards the
Vega F II operates about 32% behind of
the stock configuration or about 40%
behind the overclocked configuration as
shown in these chart
the overclocking issues we faced on Vega
ended up lowering performance overall
not raising it we think this is
primarily due to that HBM clock bug or
whatever it may be that drops the
reporting clock by 400 megahertz but
we're not positive we reached out to AMD
and haven't yet received an answer but
hopefully should have one for you soon
for the rest of the charts
now that we've Illustrated that
overclocking issue will leave OC and out
fire strike extreme shows similar
performance with Vega FPS sandwich
between the 1070 EFI with a 1070 EFI
about 13 percent behind Vega and a 1080
EFI cards with Vega EFI about 5.5
percent behind the 1080 F II that's 1080
EFI and Vega EFI where Vega has lost
some ground at 1440p versus the previous
test Vega EFI is about 29% behind the
1080 TI and about 34% behind the titan
XP reference card for fire strike at
1080 P times by an FPS numbers that
correspond to these check the article
linked below for gaming let's start with
AMD's most favorite benchmarking
scenario then move on to other games
with doom at 4k and ultra settings using
async compute in Vulcan the Vega EFI
card operates an average FPS of 60 4.2
which places it slower than a GTX 1080
Fe by about 5% slower than a 1080i F II
card by 28% and slower than a Titan XP
card by 32% due to the thermal limiter
going to a hybrid mod the Titan XP
performs much higher as we showed
several months ago and using the 1080i
gaming addict increases performance
somewhat significantly over the TI fe
just for reference the 1070 FP runs a
54.7 FBS average which is about 10 FPS
lower than the Vega F II card
moving to Ghost Recon wildlands at 4k
with very high settings the Vega EFI
card runs an average FPS of 37.7 1% lows
of 34 and 0.1% levels of 33.7 fps in the
very least and these frame times are
reasonably consistent here so that's
good unfortunately the card still runs
about 12% slower than a 1080 F II at 43
FPS average and about 32% slower than
the 1080 TI FPS 55 FPS and consistently
times lows for reference with Titan XP
card operates a 60 FPS average with a
1080 TI gaming X at 58 FPS average the
1070 operates at 35 average with lows
around 30 and a gtx 980ti operates
roughly the same 33.7 FPS average at
1440p with Ghost Recon
the Vega F II card manages to maintain
62 FPS average which marks it about tied
with a GTX 970 and average FPS though
Vegas low-end performance is still
remarkably consistent with a 980 TI
about 8 percent slower than Vega F II
1080i cards are all in the 90s alongside
the Titan XP making the Vega Fe card
about 32% slower than the slowest 1080
TI our 1080p results will be in the
article that is interest you let's move
on to another benchmark that's
historically been favorable to Andy and
Sniper Elite 4 with DirectX 12 and async
compute at high settings and 4k Vega Fe
operates a fifty-three FPS average with
the lows close by this marks the 1070 F
e card 10.2 percent slower and marks
Vega epi about 11.5 percent slower than
the GTX 1080 F II card or Vega about
thirty percent slower than the 1080 TI f
e card moving to a Titan XP the
difference now becomes a 39 percent
deficits on Vega F II maybe then Ash's
with DirectX 12 and high settings will
show some difference with this game Vega
Fe runs an average of its 69.50 s with
lows at 40 4.6 and 40.7 zr1 % the GTX
1080 Fe card operates about 10 FPS
faster at seventy eight point nine FBS
and the 1070 Fe card operates about nine
FPS lower than Vega Fe at 61 Titan XP is
nearly 100 FPS average for its
persistent difference of about a 30%
deficit on Vega F II since the launch of
this card it seems that some of the
community has been a bit disillusioned
by Vega FP a few things here first of
all and the at least in their initial
dem I was never said that they were
competing with a 1080 TI at CES when the
1080 I did not yet exist the demo that
they had set up was a GTX 1080 a Vega
card with vsync on in some game demo so
no you can't see the fps in those demos
it is entirely possible that Vega FP was
slower and probably was because vsync
was on but the point was they're
comparing it to a 1080 F II the
community over the past couple weeks
leading up to launch had amped itself at
least in part to believing that Vega Fe
would be competing with a Titan XP or a
1080 TI and gain reforms that's clearly
not the case that doesn't mean it's a
bad card what we can look forward to on
the gaming side of things now that we've
tested this and have a pretty educated
understanding of performance of Vega
hence buying it for the channel
what we can learn is that we know the
power consumption metrics we know some
of the thermal behavior we know some of
the clock behavior and in theory if Andy
is on the same silicon which they should
be maybe minus one HBM module or stack
if they're on the same silicon with
maybe a slight clock bump as has been
rumored it is possible that our X Vega
will be pretty competitive with a GTX
ten eighty founders Edition at leaves
because that's what we primarily tested
if that's the case and if NV is able to
make rx Vega in the 400 to 500 dollar
range it would be pretty competitive so
saying that there's no reason to panic
it has been the wildermann and a whole
lot of flame whores online about this
card there's no reason for any of that
on the gaming side our advice to you is
not to speculate and wait because as
it's clearly shown by this card there's
a possibility it does okay in gaming
when it's our X beta not when it's the
frontier edition which costs thousand
dollars much like this at twelve hundred
dollars without the context of the 1080p
I would it seemed quite a bit different
than it does today as for performance
the card the Vega EFI card is ahead and
Cadia is ahead increo is ahead of
medical and power software performance
not in power consumption it's behind
there as and consumes more power now
with regard to gaming performance to
give NVIDIA credit they do more or less
crush Vega efi at the price point and
performance if you look at something
like a 1080i even a Titan XP that price
goes out the window there but whether or
not that's relevant is up to you
entirely that Vega F II card is not
something we would recommend for gaming
just like the Titan XP is not something
we would recommend for gaming wait for
our X Vega or look at something else
like a 1080 or 1080i we'll look at our
x-ray guys soon enough but overall what
we can look at here for our X Vega is
the basics and then as far as
performance and extrapolating
performance my advice would be don't I
would say we're not quite sure what this
means for performance on RX Vega just
yet there are still variables and keep
your hopes realistic for RX Vega by
which I mean don't hope for anything
just wait and see we
should have one to test if it's not sent
to us we will buy one so we'll
definitely have a review up and can
followup with Vega at that time when
it's appropriate to for gaming but for
today we have a pretty good idea of
thermal power and noise so that really
lays out all stairs to save out there
most are noise have some decent ideas
from spec view perv and blender and then
anything else will be done separately we
have a hybrid model coming up shortly
assuming we're able to mount it liquid
cool it to this card so subscribe for
