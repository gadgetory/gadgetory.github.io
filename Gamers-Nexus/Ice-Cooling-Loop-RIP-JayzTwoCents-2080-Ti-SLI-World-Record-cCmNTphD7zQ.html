by posting multiple of his own scores in
succession he complained about not
having enough time for this I told you I
got to put this away I don't have time I
don't time to screw around with this
well Jay if you don't have enough time
for this you can call me mother fucking
father time because I'll make time all
day to beat your scores and that my
friends is what we just did so Jay I
would like to welcome you to our current
high standing that time of filming so
right now what I'm looking at if it's
not different on what's on the screen is
a fifteen thousand a twenty five
graphics score and a twelve thousand
four hundred and thirty three points he
views score which beats Jay by several
hundred points before that this video is
brought to you by Power colors rx 588
gigabyte card which is marked down to
$200 with rebate starting September 29th
on new egg and that is for the 8
gigabyte model if you're looking for a
mid-range video card for gaming on high
settings consider power colors 8
gigabyte rx 580 that we linked below the
card also comes with three free games
including Assassin's Creed Odyssey star
control and Strange Brigade while
supplies last
learn more at the link below Jay the one
with the most golden of all the golden
samples Jay is the favorite apparently
among manufacturers or it just gets very
lucky and has an insane CPU that doesn't
even need to be deleted ours is deleted
not only is it deleted but we put it in
50 pounds of ice you salty Jay yes salty
yet because that lowers the freezing
point of my bucket of ice that's what
we're working with right now we have the
CPU radiator dunked and ice we have
excuse me well there's a five hundred
sixty millimeter GPU radiator and there
take my word for it there's a water a
pond pump in there that's what that is
and we have that hooked up to fairly
condensation proof a blue shop towel
we'll see how long that holds you might
lose a part but it's been good so far
and I have to thank Ritchie and build
Zoid for being patient with me
while I walked through this whole
process so Jay
your turn find the time for it if you
can I don't know I did I didn't seem
that problem finding time for it so our
biggest limitation now will soon become
power and that's something we can just
run in extension cables for or something
I don't know but for the score we have
of presently fifteen thousand to forty
two you know ji I think you can do it I
believe in you but seriously
J has done some really crazy good
overclocking on the GPU side
I had a few tricks up my sleeve for this
one we might reveal in this video I
don't know we film like we filmed how
many gigabytes
we filmed two hundred fifty gigabytes of
all of this crap for the last three days
so there's the build there's the ice
bucket there's the overclocking so I
have no idea how we're gonna split the
videos but I want the score to go up
sooner because I I just I I want J to
see it I want it to keep him up at night
like this kept me up at night when I saw
his scores go up so J thank you very
much for participating I'm sorry to say
that it's over but it was fun while it
lasted and I'll see you in California
assuming well I guess he did threaten to
fly here and cut my hair in my sleep so
so if I actually lose I'm gonna fly to
North Carolina I'm gonna break in and
I'm going to take clippers to him while
he sleeps and then that's not creepy at
all but it's totally worth it to win
this battle whatever maybe I'll see you
here brain scissors strong ones okay so
I don't know how we're gonna cut this
but we'll have other videos talking
about the build process I'm gonna try
and beat the score myself we're going to
do a live stream before I tear all this
down assuming nothing dies tonight we're
gonna do a live stream showing it off
one final time before I tear it down
we're gonna put the time for that on the
screen now so if you tabs away check
back and look at the screen that's gonna
have the date and the time for the live
stream before we tear this beast down
and it will be no more so J if you post
a better score I'm going to assume it's
only because I gave you all of the ideas
that you used it to beat our score
because your hardware is by and large at
superior in every single way so all you
have to do is muster up the skill I
guess to do the rest of it
I mean we did everything anyway if you
don't know if EJ is James to senses
Channel we've had a lot of fun working
with Jay on this and a friendly
competition on overclocking their Bauer
jumped in jerk head and so the fun will
soon be over for all of us but he can
check him out on YouTube as well anyway
I will transition to some other part of
the video or something so for the bench
hardware this is kind of a crazy
configuration first of all big shout
outs Rubbermaid who didn't sponsor us
and I have no idea what works for their
7 year 8 quart cooler I bought this at
the local hardware store we filled it
with a lot of ice I'm sure the gas
station doesn't know why we kept going
back and buy a nice either but we've got
a 360 Thermaltake rat in here with this
was really not meant to be in here
originally and then we have a 560 rat
down there ideally this would be
horizontal not what it is here it's
gonna get air stuck in it and it's it's
got issues where the water can't really
flow through it we have a pond pump in
there so that's that part of the build
the motherboard is an e bjx 299 dark
which is the best overclocking board
I've worked with so X 299 dark for our
study 980 XE CPU yes very funny you know
the meme so that's that's our set up
there G skull try and Z memory that I've
overclocked pretty heavily tighten the
timings really heavily so that's doing
well the VR is kept cool by built-in
fans we have a an ek furious fan here ek
furious fan there they're like 2500 rpm
so that's cooling the V RMS on the vram
for the cards which I've completely
surgically taken apart and put back
together again so we have blue shop
towel everywhere I shorted the shunts on
the cards with liquid metal I was gonna
solder some three million shots on there
and if J responds maybe that's what I'll
do but next but I had to do something
that I could do without taking
everything apart and that was put liquid
metal on I couldn't get a soldering iron
in there so we have hard mods as an
option next but anyway that's the video
cards are there we have an AC swan we
have an EVGA XE ultra on a riser card
asus rog Strix which is a beast of an
overclocker we have to get rid of the
efi card this is cooling all those we
have this as exhaust blowing all the hot
air that way which provides some
pressure on the right half the VRMs of
this and then a Knox with 3000 rpm
industrial fan in the back
forcing air through just brute force
through all of the shop towel and
everything cooling the bottom VRMs and B
Ram and those by the way we're running
about 40 degrees Celsius maybe and most
recently about 35 and that's because
everything around it is freaking
freezing so that's that's the set up for
the most part we have EK supremacy
blocks on the GPUs we didn't do blocks
on the water on the vrm because it's
just totally irrelevant can pull it with
air and I other than that we have an ax
1600 I Corsair power supply that's done
very well with all of this and then I I
think that's it I think that's
everything I think that pretty much
covers it you guys supremacy block on
the CPU a lot of shop towel the whole
goal of this is to stop air from hitting
metal things because that's when or
anything honestly because that's when
condensation will form including the
tubes which are the EK zmt tubing so
there's zero maintenance to in these
were specifically chosen the black tubes
which are mostly covered up now but
there's one down there these were
specifically chosen so that we could
help insulate them keep the cold in and
and reduce condensation concerns then we
have a thermocouple k-type hooked up
with one in the tank and one in the loop
for the GPUs for a point nine degrees in
the tank and we're at four point on the
loop Celsius of course so that's our
test bench okay so for part of the
settings we're using the hot keys and
I'm going to give away pretty much all
the secrets here so J will now beat us
by using the secrets and because he has
better hardware so that's all he needs
to do is use the tricks but anyway this
is what we're doing I am setting the
clocks on the memory and the core based
on the current load of times by which
I've checked with a current clamp
meticulously through the whole
benchmarking process so I know when it
goes up and down in current requirements
and I can adjust the clocks to counter
that based on the workload so all we're
doing is we're just going to change the
clocks for each test like right now I'm
dropping to an offset of 1180 on the
memory down from 12:40 so it's on 1240
offset memory for the first task
now we're down to 1180 and we were on
170 offset core for the first test and
now we're at an offset of I think 165
and then this test eventually we're
going to hit a spot where the current
again changes the current requirements
so once we get there I'm going to
increase the frequency by an extra 10
megahertz to give me some extra score
while we can get it in this part of the
bench so it's waiting for that and then
we also have a part later where we're
gonna have to drop the memory frequency
and the core frequency to try and an
encounter artifact and that'll happen on
the memory so the CPU tasks I'm dropping
everything on the GPU jeebies done it's
not really gonna impact the results of
this test it's entirely CPU and so we're
dropping the GPS so we don't have to
worry about supporting that overclock
anymore it is no longer a concern now
we're just focusing on supporting the
CPU overclock and I just changed the
match ratio so it's going to crash but
before when we had 34 mesh I was stable
now I was pushing 35 I don't think I'm
gonna get it but I wanted to give it a
shot but that gives us a good
opportunity to get back into BIOS and
see our other settings so on the EVGA
BIOS and what I've got right now going
on previously I could not get over 4.8
gigahertz at all like we had the first
four cores at 49 everything I was 48 so
that's why J was well I don't know how
his CPU score was lower originally but
that his his CPU clocks of 5.0 25.1 were
supporting a higher graphics score in a
significant way because the Seaview is
able to better keep up with it so now
we're at 51
for the first two cores that pushes so
for rendering tasks GPU bound things
where you have draw calls this first two
core is at a higher frequency will help
keep up with the GPU whereas the rest
are at 5.0 so we're at 5 gigahertz for
those the stable mesh ratio was 34 not
35 although I did just try it and then
everything has been 1.9 5v core 1.45 the
mash 1.38
VCC i/o was 1.33 before I increased the
mesh and then essai is one point one
eight five I was running lower before
500 on core offset this is where we've
done a lot of tweaking so I spent
a whole day on this this is a g.skill
try dingy black 36 hundred megahertz kit
they're setting a better one into but we
pushed this one to 4000 megahertz and
it's on 1.85 dim v10
I've got 15 15 15 28 I kind of was
stable on 26 but dropped it for more
stability on 28 five five for the RR DS
we're at 38 for your foie at e-file were
at one for command rate and then all
these so T RFC we're at TW our is 22 RFC
is the refresh cycle for the memory so
this you want this number to be low this
is how quickly it refreshes the memory
to to grab whatever it needs to get next
and so we lowered that quite a bit from
stock refresh interval our efi this you
want high because you want the memory to
retain its data for absolutely as long
as possible without ever refreshing it
in benchmarking so we've maxed that out
we have C ke 6 we've dropped w w DD or w
RW d r2 7r w DD to 7 r WS r to 7 and i'm
trying to get these lower but that's
kind of where they were stable on this
kid in memory we've turned off some of
the features of the CPU I'm not going to
go through all those right now and that
gets us to where we are at I just set it
to 5.1 gigahertz as well so we're gonna
give that a shot before closing out
everything but so that's it that's that
score I got for now back to you J I
guess I'd really rather you don't get up
from this one though because I have
things to do
but I'll always make time for you Jay
it's you got me right here right here in
the heart I think is what humans call it
when you talked about your time
constraints and I feel for you but I am
eternal so I'll come back whenever your
respond they go out for watching
subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow and access to help
us out directly go to store my cameras
access dot net to pick up one of our mod
mats or any of our other products like
our shirts if you like these videos I
want to support them because holy crap
this took a lot of time as Jay said and
it's very expensive to produce this kind
of content so help us out if you feel
like you can otherwise check back for
the livestream that's the best way to
help us if you don't want to spend money
and we'll post again that date and time
summer in the video thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
