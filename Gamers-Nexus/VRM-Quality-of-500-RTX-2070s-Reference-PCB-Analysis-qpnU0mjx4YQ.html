hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the RT x 2070
reference PCB from well EVGA here but
this is the same PCB you would find on
like a Nvidia founders Edition card
because while this is the reference PCB
as much as nvidia likes to pretend like
reference like the founders cards
founders edition cards aren't reference
cards they very much are you're not
gonna find a card with a worse PCB than
a founders Edition it just so happens
that founders editions are generally a
lot better than what Nvidia used to put
out so it kind of makes sense to to you
know hold them in a higher regard
compared to say like a reference
I don't know GTX 580 PCB gtx 680 PCB
yeah definitely much better than like a
gtx 680 reference PCB before that this
video is brought to you by autonomous AI
where you can buy they're automatically
raising and lowering smartdesq tables
and table legs if you'd like to build a
raising and lowering table similar to
our set table the DIY kit is $250 and is
easy to assemble to a service of your
choice if you'd prefer something
pre-built the full tables can be had
from 300 and up you can learn more at
the link in the description below for
autonomous AI anyway today we're taking
a look at the 2070 and so this is a
twenty series and you know and video
cards so of course we have the usual set
of voltages and so let's start going
around and identifying all of them
starting of course with the most
important voltage regulator for of
course the V chord which powers the GPU
core which is why we call it V core and
I've written that really badly so let me
just slightly tweak that that's slightly
better up above that in which is kind of
a normal position for this we have the
memory of erm so that's an e mem and
that of course powers all over the
micron GDD are six memory chips micron
is currently the exclusive supplier of
GD d are six for all of the geforce
cards samsung also makes GD d are six
but you're not gonna find it on a on a
sort of consumer card you might find
like i think they're reserved only for
like tesla cards and quad rose
yeah micron G DDR six on this as usual
down in this area I'm assuming we have
the pecs rail I am not 100% certain
about that but this just seems like a
reasonable place to put the pecs rail
because that powers the PCIe interface
and some of the internal PLL's of the
GPU core this right here might be and
this is where it gets messy cuz this
right here I assume as the BIOS chip
because there's not really anything else
that chip could be considering where
it's located but the thing is we have a
whole bunch of regulators in this area
and at this point this is gets becomes a
bit of a mess because we need a 5 volts
rail for the V R M so you need a v RM to
power the v RM and i'm not sure where
that is it could be this but this could
also be 1.8 volts which would be a
supporting rail for the GDD r 6 memory
chips as well as powering the bios chip
and then this could be 5 volts but the
thing is this also has a USB C port so
this over here could be the USB C power
rail so yeah and unfortunately all of
these like two of them they do seem to
share like the the componentry between
them seems to be the same for a couple
of them so that makes it even harder to
figure out which is which but those are
the rails that are present here I'm just
not sure which one is which one because
I don't have the card in hand to check
for sure if I had the card in hand it'd
be relatively easy so that's kind of the
situation with the minor rails and now
let's get into actually looking at the V
Corps v RM since it's so important in a
bit more detail so we have a 1 2 3 4 5 6
phase so nothing crazy right there
controlled by a chip on the back of the
board because of course there's not like
the board's not long enough to cram it
behind the V curve erm proper and that's
this chip down here which is a that's a
u p95 12 so this is pretty standard for
the Nvidia cards this goes up to eight
phases output of course here it's only
running on six so
not running at 8:00 it's running
six-phase it goes up to two megahertz
switching frequency it has a SM bus
interface so you can in theory do things
like control the load line on it well
configure a whole bunch of functions of
the chip and like control the voltage
and monitor the voltage and output
current and operating temperature of the
vrm assuming Nvidia actually allows you
to access that last last I've heard or
at least as far as I'm aware you can't
actually get access to this because the
Nvidia driver won't let you and I think
it might even be straight-up disabled so
it's kind of like like the chip has it
it's just not necessarily being used now
for the actual voltage control this
being an Nvidia chip and video card it
of course uses the PWM vid interface
which basically is a PWM signal from the
GPU core to this chip which is used to
then set the output voltage of the vrn
which is a nice really like simple way
of doing voltage control at like very
very rapidly so that's that's why Nvidia
goes with that because that's a really
it's a really elegant way of solving
your voltage control it's just kind of
unfortunate that that means you also
need to have like you need to go through
the Nvidia driver to control that though
it is easy to physically modify but
software wise you need to go through the
driver anyway back to the front of the
board so it is a six phase and as each
of the phases runs one of these power
stages here and these are on
semiconductor NCP 3 1 0 255 and these
are 55 amp power stages or dr moss so
they're not so that that stands for
driver MOFs and basically these are
these are power stages they're just not
very intelligent compared to say like
smart power stages or but there's a
whole bunch of other flavors of power
stages that integrate things like
temperature monitoring current
monitoring over current protection these
don't really do any of that these are
just a 55 amp power stage where you get
a dry it you get a driver and you get
to power and you get your high side and
your low side MOSFET in one convenient
package and these are respect to be well
the datasheet says these go all the way
up to fifty five amps but all of the
efficiency curves only go up to 40 so
that makes things a little bit difficult
because basically we can't actually look
at current outputs you know in that 55
like perfectly like how much heat each
of these power stages makes at 55m five
amps output is not actually available in
the datasheet even though they are
marketed as being 55 amp port which is
always fun well that's the same thing as
all of the 60 amp power stage is only
going up to 50 amps in the data sheets
except for some exceptions but most of
them if it's spectat 60 it only spec
aspects the heat output up to 50 amps
and then it's just like and normally
that's done because honestly you're not
gonna go to the maximum output of a
power stage just because it would
produce so much heat that it'll be
uncool about regardless of the fact that
you're aware that it's going to be
producing too much heat so anyway
looking at the output for at the vrm
heat output for a 1 volt output so
that's nice compared to say all of the
like on the other cards so far on the 20
series it's always like really high-end
70 M for smart power stages from like
Fairchild or something and those are
always SPECT in 1.8 volts well these are
expecting 1 volt so that's very nice 500
kilohertz switching frequency and of
course running on 5 volts because they
don't run on anything but 5 volts you're
gonna be looking at sort of the
following efficiencies for the following
output currents so 50 amps output which
that would be roughly around stock so a
stock stock current output would be
somewhere around 150 amps average and
that that now looks like an a but there
that's a 1 yeah anyway so stock would be
around somewhere maybe slightly over
that 150 amp figure there you'd be
looking at about 15 watts of heat output
which is really just fine like that is
not a problem whatsoever then once you
start overclocking assuming the power
limit goes high enough which last I've
heard it
and you could be looking at something
like 200 amps output and then the vrm
would be producing about 24 watts of
heat which still really isn't that bad
immediately that's 24 watts of heat
concentrated on a much smaller surface
area than say some of the other GP like
VRMs we've looked at recently right like
it's worth considering that this is a
six phase so while it might be producing
only a little bit more heat than some of
the eight phase and ten phase and twelve
phase and much higher phase count VRMs
at 200 amps output this is a lot denser
so it will still end up being hotter
even though that like it'll be much more
hotter which that's great English right
there but it'll be like more hotter than
you would necessarily expect from the
very slight decrease in sort of
efficiency right that's not a huge loss
like the efficiency isn't that much
worse but it's also denser so that's
worth keeping in mind and then the
absolute maximum current output that the
datasheet really allows you to go up to
easily without while extrapolating where
the where the efficiency curves would go
you're looking at about 240 amps
producing about 32 watts of heat which
is still manageable
like that's admittedly you will need
like of erm heatsink on some airflow but
that is still not a ridiculous amount of
heat but yeah this this is not exactly a
super-powerful vrm especially compared
to say like a twenty eighty or even
other GPUs in this price category this
video room is really not not impressive
because well honestly if you if you
actually look at even cheaper cards like
vega's these days are cheaper than one
of these the the Vega reference PCB is
like ridiculous compared to this so you
know but obviously this doesn't need an
insane vrm it's just worth considering
that yeah this this is pretty
it fits the purpose but it's not exactly
incredibly impressive and it's not
really it's it's also a bigger step down
in terms of the vrm design compared to
like the the 2080 or the 2080 ti like
the
the the downgrading of the vrm going
from like a 20 atti to a 20 80 - this
thing is pretty significant even if the
well the price the price differences are
also so kind of makes sense but it is
worth noting that this isn't super
powerful but it's not super terrible and
honestly I don't see why in videos
shipping these cards like I would
happily shove 240 amps through this like
even on air cooling as long as the air
cooler has good vrm cooling I would
totally just go for and shove 24 240
amps through this vrm it shouldn't
really have a problem with that this
isn't so much heat that it's uncool
about especially considering that
there's like you know well there there's
a lot of cards in the past that would do
well hell of a lot worse than this right
here and those were fine so the this is
yeah this is a nice enough erm it's not
super overkill but it's fitting for sort
of a mid-range card it's kind of
unfortunate that apparently the power
limits are super low the memory of erm
is in typical memory vrm fashion massive
overkill it's like every time somebody
needs to power memory they go for
ridiculous overkill though here we
actually see a pretty big difference
compared to some to the say the 20 80
and the 20 atti because for once we're
not using a new sort of NVIDIA voltage
controller the voltage controller for
this lovely two-phase right here right
one two is AUP 1666 and this is the same
voltage controller you would find on a
loss of the 10 series GPUs and this
thing this thing is really dumb this
does not have any digital interface
whatsoever
it just has a PWM vid input and every
all of its functionality is configured
by resistors around the chip so that's
that's kind of how that works right
there but it is a 2 phase voltage
controller so this is a two phase vrm
and for the actual MOSFETs because these
are power stages these are straight up
Moll so that's while dual N fats because
you have one chip but there's two
MOSFETs built into that chip and then
the drivers for the
MOSFETs are actually built into the U P
1666 here so basically this is hooked
directly to the two MOSFETs in each of
those packages over there
so these right here are Fairchild
Semiconductor fdpc can't see my notes
properly 5 0 1 8 SG dual infants and
they have a 1.6 million low side which
is really really good and if I remember
correctly in video is using these for
some reference card on the 10 series as
v core power so these are totally out of
place for powering a like a couple G DDR
6 memory chips this is really really
overkill the end result is that
basically you're looking at sort of
doing one point three five volts
actually let's put that where it
normally is so you're looking at these
doing like 1.3 5 volts output because
that's what G DDR six runs on 500
kilohertz switching frequency and I'm
assuming a gate drive voltage of 12
volts so there because that's just the
easiest way to power them since you have
12 volts available on the card anyway so
420 amps output on these you'd be
looking at about 2 watts of heat which
is in line with what you would get with
like the like the 20 80 and the 20 80 TI
V RMS actually get about the same
efficiency even though those of you arms
are like much nicer it's just they're
massively like the components there are
super over SPECT and you can't really
like there's a limit to how efficient
your vrm can be also this isn't
factoring in the power that this chip
uses which skews these results a bit
better because the power stages do
include their driver losses which this
doesn't because the drivers are built
into that and I'm calculating just the
losses on the MOSFETs themselves anyway
going up from that 20 amps output to 30
amps these start actually getting a bit
worse and producing about 3.5 watts of
heat and then 40 amps output you're
going to be looking at about 5 watts of
the heat so definitely like these these
are
definitely czar definitely weaker this
is definitely a weaker memory vrm than
what you would have on like a 2080 or a
2080 ti it's just not a massive
difference because you're really not
going to be going very high current
output anyway
GD d r 6 especially with just the 1 2 3
4 5 8 chips that you have here they're
really not going to be exceeding that 20
to 30 amp output range so this should be
perfectly fine running passive as long
as there's not too much heat just sort
of soaking into the PCB from everything
else because obviously these produce
heat that produces heat this produces
heat and with the PCB being as small as
it is the PCB zone sort of thermal
dissipation capabilities kind of suck
because it doesn't have a lot of its own
surface area which is actually like a
valid way of getting things cooled if
you can't like if you don't want to have
an actual heatsink having a lot of
unnecessary PCB space can actually do a
lot of that for you but obviously this
doesn't have that this is as short as it
can possibly be so yeah but the memory
of your room here again just completely
like definitely fitting for the fit for
purpose basically they're nice solid
memory vrm completely acceptable v core
nothing incredible but definitely
acceptable and the last thing left is of
course the usual 20 series power
management stuff it's probably the best
term to use for it and there is as usual
a ton of it so that right there is of
course our favorite up7 6 v 1 power
management chip which is used of course
for balancing the 12 volt inputs of the
card because you have 12 volts coming in
from there and 12 volts coming in from
here and this might have a power limit
of like 150 and this might have a power
limit of a 75 watts and I now realize
why NVIDIA has such a low power limit
saying for these cards of course it only
it can only pull a maximum of 25 watts
without exceeding PCIe specs
yeah that actually makes a lot of sense
yeah that pretty much explains it the
stock TDP has to be like 190 or
something yeah yeah that makes sense
anyway so you have like a 150 watt limit
here 75 watt limit here and
unfortunately you don't really get to
choose how current goes through your
phases well the the you p95 12 can
actually current balance all of your
phases but you don't have perfect
control over where you're gonna be
getting your power from so you could end
up in situations where you know this has
a 150 watt limit but you're gonna try to
pull 200 Watts through that and only
like 25 Watts
through the PCIe slot which is like
you're technically still under that 225
limit that the card has total but your
you'd be power throttling off of the
PCIe connector so the job of the U P of
the up7 651 here is to basically go and
switch some of the phases of the vrm
from pulling power on the 8 pin to
pulling power on the PCIe slot or if the
PCIe slot is being overdrawn taking
whatever phase is over pulling the PCIe
slot and moving it onto the 8 pin
reducing the power throttling because
you're not going to be bouncing off of
the power limit for each of the
connectors as much as you'd normally
would and you can really like actually
like max out the total board limit
instead of just whatever power connector
you're maxing out so that's a new
feature of the 20 series owners
personally I think this is completely
pointless there's a lot of cards in the
past where they just didn't bother with
worrying about where the power came from
it was just kind of a case well the card
has a power limit of 300 watts where
those 300 Watts come from that's a
completely different matter and is not
actually considered by the GPU
whatsoever it'll just kind of pull them
wherever it can get them which can in
theory like lead to some issues but you
know it's worked fine up until now I
don't I don't really see a reason why
you would you know bother with something
like this but Nvidia felt like it was
necessary so that they went ahead and
did it and to make sure that this chip
can do its power manage
as quickly and as effectively as
possible you obviously need something to
actually monitor that all of the power
going through the card and that's done
by this chip over here which is of
course the on semiconductor NCP forty
five four nine one and unlike the rest
of the twenty series so far there is
only one of those because normally you
have two of them here you have yes
indeed you have just one and it's on the
back of the card so that's how the power
management is done here you know you
have the NCP for forty five four nine
one for monitoring all of your power
draws and this for balancing them and
while balancing your to power inputs the
voltage controller itself actually
balances the current through the phases
but which phases are on which power
connectors the voltage controller really
doesn't care about which is why you can
run into that situation where you'd be
pulling more from the eight pin then
you'd be allowed to without actually
maxing out the PCI uslaugh and then
power throttling which is why you need
the extra circuitry to manage where the
phases actually get their power from
because the U P 9512 really doesn't know
and it really doesn't care so that
pretty much covers the power management
stuff except for the shunts which you
have one here and you have one here and
those are being monitored by that NCP
for forty five four nine one chip and
you also have a shunt over here so I
guess that might be for the USB C port
may be kind of intra there a third shunt
okay well if you're wondering about how
they're wired up you can always just use
a multimeter to check which ones
connected to what I'd have it as a guess
that this one's for the eight pin and
this one would probably be beat for the
PCIe slot so that is the RT x 2070
reference PCB it's not the most
impressive thing ever but it's
definitely like for for what it has to
do it's you know completely adequate you
got a solid little six phase
and little is actually the right term to
use because that is compact and then you
have a nice you know the nice little to
faith well that's not actually a little
memory VR I'm you can get much much
smaller memory power systems but you get
a nice two-phase memory power and yeah
not really much else to the card than
that so that is it for the video like
