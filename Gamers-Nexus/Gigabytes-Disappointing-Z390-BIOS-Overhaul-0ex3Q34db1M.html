or intact it's no mystery at this point
that Intel's coming out with the 9900 K
and other CPUs and so is e39
motherboards are coming with that we
have the gigabyte Ethernet 19 master in
front of us we have the azrog z3 90
Taichi ultimate we've got the msi
completely changed brand in here meg z3
90 god-like talked about that more later
and the gigabyte ones one we're gonna
look at today so this isn't a review
it's not a PCB analysis we're getting to
that though build Zoid has all the data
he needs what we're looking at right now
is the BIOS the reason we're looking at
this is because gigabyte has routinely
had one of the worst BIOS and just
anything integrations that we've had to
work with over the past few years and
asus is clearly a market leader in their
BIOS capabilities like what you can
achieve with it in overclocking msi has
gotten way better for usability
gigabytes kind of in stock but they've
completely rebuilt it for this series
and so that's what we're gonna look at
and see is it actually better because I
know a lot of you have had the same
question before that this video is
brought to you by Thermal Grizzlies
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal Grizzlies cryo not is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo not has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below first of all
for this board we'll talk a little bit
about the hardware but not much there's
an actual finned heat sink on there so
I'm really happy about that I haven't
tested it yet don't know if it's any
good we'll test vrm thermals soon enough
but gigabyte did this 4x4 70 as well and
they were like the only motherboard
manufacturer to get the memo and start
doing finned heat sinks again so really
cool to see that in the very least they
still have the covers on top of it so
marketing still gets what they want
which is for the heatsink to be
completely obstructed by things but it
looks like engineering and tactical
marketing have successfully managed
to get finns under the obstructions so
there's still more service area even
though there's not a lot of airflow from
the top but that's okay because we can
still get some air in through the inner
rim of it and through the outside so
significantly better than previously and
marketing still gets what they want but
we're here to talk more about BIOS today
so let's take a look at that so this is
the new BIOS I am going to be learning
this with you today and criticizing it
and complimenting it live as I see it
for the first time as well so you can
learn it with me this is I guess
considered easy mode or as hard mode
this is easy mode we have classic mode
f2 what's that okay it looks like the
old one so here's the old BIOS basically
in a wrapper it's got a bit of a UI
change around the outer edges but where
where's hardwood where's that Vance mode
normally there's an advanced mode with
the easy mode but I guess it's just
classic we'll look through it more but I
think it's just class mode so this is
the only one we actually care about
let's look at this so for some of the
complaints I had I've always disliked
the smart fan settings option in
gigabytes bios that's disappointing
that's the same so this is the reason I
didn't like this is because it's
separate pop-up and none of the hotkeys
work on this screen specifically so
smart fan I would like to be able to get
into BIOS set my fan speeds to like fall
for example and I do like this feature a
lot apply to all I really like that so
they've they've always had that though
and then I want to be able to hit f10
and save and exit but none of the
hotkeys work here so gigabyte does this
a lot where they have all these weird
popups within it's like windows within
windows within Windows as unnecessary
levels of complexity but so I guess this
is the new Advanced Mode let's get into
the advanced frequency settings this is
where most of the action happens for
overclocking on gigabytes boards base
clock is standard typically 100 and it
looks like if you hit Enter on this it
pops up just a list of every number in
the world between 80 and whatever the
max is whatever their max is so kind of
interesting choice there of course you
should just type in the number you want
but be CLK slice ratios for graphics
known really uses these but it's nice to
have the option I suppose CBO upgrade
should probably be a lookup table
pree overclocks that they've set and
what I would like to see is if I open
this and I select one I want to see
reflected in BIOS what it's changing so
I want to see that number turn into 48
right now if it's if what 4.8 does is
change the clock ratio to 448 then I
want to see that number reflected when I
enter the pre overclocked setting and
likewise I would like to see in the
voltage tab I would like to see what
they're trying to set for that so we
still have like current setting over
here I want to know what's there for the
the new option we just chose so that's
something I'd like to see changed for
this BIOS I guess it's not off to the
best start we already know the fan
settings haven't really changed how they
work so that's not different
the advanced core options probably where
we look next I would love to have so
here's what I'd like gigabyte if you're
if you're watching this here's what I
would like to see what gigabyte really
needs to get away from is having 10,000
menus within menus and having like
pop-ups of numbers between 80 and 500
with a significant figure accuracy of 2
decimal points like it's just not it's
this is just unnecessarily difficult to
navigate even though it's but apparently
been upgraded I'm still see a lot of the
problems I've had so like this page this
page should have if you're looking at
CPU overclocking core clocks things like
that just just multipliers to what I'm
looking for you're looking at just
multipliers
I shouldn't have to go into a submenu
called advanced CPU core settings and
then navigate to the cores here under
the Intel Turbo Boost Technology section
which is kind of confusing I think for
most likely anyone who's not worked with
a gigabyte board before is used to other
boards what I want to see is per CPU
clock ratio it should just have sub
options under it where you can set 48 X
4 cores 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 47 X 4 cores 3 through
whatever so that's that's problem I have
with gigabyte BIOS too many menus within
menus it looks like that hasn't changed
yet but we'll keep looking through it
and see what they've improved so yeah
I'd really I'd love to see the CPU
overclocking page simplified
and I don't know I like it's hard to say
it's I think it's hard to make a lot of
changes that would really make a lot of
sense without looking like they're
copying Asus because Asus just does it
so well but I'm positive that there is a
better way to do it that is not a copy
of a C's without having menus within
menus because this is just unnavigable
or four I think you know UI design 101
as few clicks as possible as the rule
so anyway turbo ratios you want to
adjust them individually they're all in
here
it is kind of nice though I will say
that gigabyte shows you the stock just
in there this is there the previous or
current settings listing over here so I
like that we can see the stock turbo
ratios that Intel provisions for the per
core sets and then for the power package
power limits this is another thing that
I think could be improved so if I type a
huge number in the power line because I
want to remove the power limitations on
gigabytes board for overclocking it up
99.9999 and it goes to auto what I
wanted to want to see it go to is the
biggest number there is which in this
case is 40 90 but you can find out by
hitting Enter which then goes through
evidently about 4,000 numbers one by one
which also seems kind of weird but it's
a quick way to find out what the maxes I
guess so I'll take that where I can get
it another thing I'd like to see is a
where's LLC do they have ILC in here
this time so this is good core current
limits good that's not changed though
they've had that for a while now number
of cores enabled is good this is
something so here's the thing all of
this stuff these are power settings and
they are power settings that relate to
the CPU for the most part but there's
like DRAM power settings in here too
there's sea state settings there's speed
shift mixed with hyper-threading mixed
with number of cores enabled makes with
per core overclocking half of that stuff
should be in a different tab like all of
the power settings in here so we've got
let's see pac is power limit cpu current
limit
see States all of that stuff package see
state limit all of those power settings
energy-efficient turbo what is that
that's as well probably should move but
all of these settings I think like the
power setting should be moved into I
don't know how about like voltage and
power settings or something something
that makes more sense I look at this
like so it's top menu you have this menu
here MIT I don't know what that stands
for I never have but you have MIT which
is all I know is this is the
overclocking tab that's the only place I
care about so we have that menu then you
have all these other ones pretty
standard stuff and then the MIT menu has
within it menus and it has no top-level
options like when I as few clicks as
possible guys so that when I load this
page I should see clock I should see
ratios I should see base clock I should
see beak or all of them the critical
stuff the overclocking should be here if
you want to bury more advanced settings
like current limitations power
limitations things like that put them in
an advanced power and voltage tab like
this but then this goes to more sub
menus and that's so ok let's go here so
it's gonna take me several clicks and
it's not like the huge amount of time
and I don't want to exaggerate it but
it'll take me several clicks to find
what I want and while that is not a big
deal you know maybe I'm spending 10
minutes looking for all the settings I
want instead of three at the end then
after that you learn where they are the
end of the day you're gonna overlook
things and forget about stuff because
it's not all in front of you so I'd
really like to see the most important
stuff for just a basic overclock I'm not
even talking advanced stuff here so I'm
not talking about like what we were
doing for the RIP J rappel TT stream
I'll talk about what builds ordinaire
Bower dude I'm talking about
I want the ratios on a per core level or
sync all cores whatever you want to call
it if you don't use a C's terminology
talking to gigabyte that should be in
the top page for whatever MIT is and I'd
like to see V core there I'd like to see
probably definitely per core
overclocking v core base clock
and probably XMP toggles should be in
there so memory based memory settings
should be Auto should be XMP and after
that you have a timings page and you let
people who want to play with hymens do
that because that's a special group of
people who want to do that that should
be buried I agree but to not have at
least just like XMP on or often here
seems like a wasted amount of clicks
because if there's one thing that I
think a lot of new builders will
overlook and gigabyte is clearly trying
to appeal the new builders to some
extent because they've revised the easy
mode bios there's one thing new builders
will overlook it's that their memory
isn't going to run at just the speed
that it says it runs at unless they go
and tell it to do that in BIOS because
of how JEDEC and the board's work
together so yeah XMP should be on this
page Correggio is base clock and I think
also I'll leave fully most up there all
the power offsets should be moved to an
easier to access page AVX offset should
probably be on the main page as well I
think that covers us for that one
another thing I do like though so this
is something I noticed earlier when
playing around with this the BIOS now
says what's changed so this saw wanted
for so long from gigabyte and Asus does
it a suits doesn't make the best things
in the world either they certainly have
flaws but if there's one thing they do
actually really well it is genuinely
BIOS and just from an ease of use
standpoint so gigabyte is now reporting
what you've changed before it reboots
which is great that's what I want to see
because I want to know what's changed in
case there's a lot of stuff in here and
it's all buried so if you're gonna bury
stuff at least tell me what I changed
that way if I accidentally change
something I know it rather than having
to dig for it later
so this is good I like this the job well
done gigabyte for adding some stuff like
that so they've started a few things
here I'm just noticing and let's let's
go back to easy mode and see if there's
any correlation there favorites
f11 okay so here's favorites and this is
something we've seen on boards in the
past it's not well I'm not sure actually
if gigabyte told BIOS has this or not
but it's good that they pre start a
bunch of the stuff I'm asking for so now
we're
getting closer to what I want here so
this this shouldn't like it's cool that
it's in favourites that's cool that's
useful it's great for usability and
human factors but this stuff should also
most of it anyway not all of it like
really we don't need vtd ERP secure boot
mode we don't need these things in
favorites but it'd be nice to have some
of these options like ratio and V core
and memory multiplier maybe or just XMP
and MIT natively without having to go to
favorites so that's something that it
seems like they kind of have the right
idea but the wrong implementation and I
go back to Advanced Mode that's only
really only thing I care about right now
so I already complain about this many as
in menus and once we get into the menus
we can see there is load line
calibration this isn't new gigabytes
kind of had this the pop ups nice this
time I guess I don't really like pop ups
typically but when you're gonna use
words to define your levels of things
like how am I supposed to know to type
in an ultra extreme I don't I wouldn't
talk with that so having the pop-up is
good what if I type in a number that is
it okay numbers correlate it that's good
too so that's good to see good human
factors there zero does that go to auto
zero should get auto but it goes to
standards I guess we'll take that don't
wait doesn't make sense
zero goes to standard what the hell
what's normal why is it normal and
standard normal standard hello okay so
what I'm looking at right now is the
bottom left what's changing when I do
this and we can see that they're mostly
changing except normal and standard
appear to be the same thing at least
visually maybe they're not I even I I
never use these I only use extreme or
high so I don't know you need to pass
some - to adjust that's good well use -
to just use plus they're just on my pad
okay good enough anything else here we
care about current protection this is
something that is a bit nebulous for me
so here's this is a complaint I've had
for gigabyte for a while now I don't
know what these mean I mean obviously I
do now but when you look at it the first
time you have b-corps over current
protection
all I know is I want it off I don't care
if it's on normal or high or extreme I
want it gone and so the core current
protection does extreme mean it is
extremely protected or does it mean it's
extremely unprotected like it allows it
to go extremely high or it's extremely
protect that's unclear so I'd like to
see the language improved on that you
should probably just use honestly like
off and and on and sort of on or
something
or if you're gonna do like current I
mean this is just a number
just current actual current number
anything CPU v core PWM switch rate okay
that's fine that's fine that's fine so
let's look at this tab this is a very
important tab like I said there's a lot
of stuff that should be moved into here
they should call voltage and power or
something like that but CB v core
they've got starred looks like well look
at the stock voltage for the actual nuke
CPUs later once they're out but they
have a enter list again I don't find
these particularly useful I also find
the words normal and Auto to be very
confusing I don't know what that means I
don't like I could find out but to me
normal and Auto mean the same thing and
that's that the user hasn't controlled
it so bit nebulous on the language I
don't find these lists particularly
useful but I guess if you're gonna do
something on an interaction it's not the
worst thing to do and maybe from a human
factors usability standpoint for a new
user they might look at this and maybe
come to the realization that they should
only really be increasing voltage about
these steps rather than typing in much
larger numbers without knowing that what
they're doing is something so maybe that
has me it's there let's read some of the
text here adjust the CB v core voltage
Auto equals BIOS automatically
configures the setting D core voltages
that can be entered manually note
extreme overclock configurations may
need a higher v core voltage which may
incur a higher temperature so I mean
that's good that's good that they warned
you about temperature from a new user
standpoint but they define Auto what is
normal anyway be CLK adaptive voltage
okay and able or disable that or go into
Auto what is Auto to
tell us enable/disable be CLK adaptive
voltage this feature is enabled and when
BCL KOC there's no need to override
voltages in order to boot at a higher B
CLK so okay so it tells you a bit will
get the correct voltages automatically
this is something that gigabytes been
guilty up for a long time though they
always have auto and able disabled for
stuff like MC E or for like this and
just just just unable to disable if the
if the functionality is switching then
Auto is okay if the functionality is non
switching and it's always going to be
enabled or disabled permanently until
you boot into BIOS then only have these
two options it should more or less be
boolean at this point so that's just a
small gripe CPVC ci ok all this is fine
si IO voltages that's good to have
exposure to in the same spot as V core
so I appreciate that and not much else
is different their chipset voltage
control this is weird too so this this
this gigabyte that's what I'm talking
about our menu is MIT advanced voltage
settings chipset voltage control and
there's one option
why what's what is the point of this
just just put it somewhere else
literally anywhere else is fine no one
changes that anyway and if they do it
can go somewhere else
DRAM voltage control okay DRAM voltage
ok 1.2 channel a B ok this seems fine
they could add a few things here but
will that builds oi talk about that
later
internal VR control ok so this is for
the fiver I guess maybe for the voltage
regulator I'm guessing not virtual
reality yes is for the looks like it's
for the vr m the fiber so we have the
graphics fiber and we have current
limits that's good that's good to see I
mean this isn't really something that I
typically use but did they have the
current limits broken out individually
let's do this it's been Tommy push Alton
to the left for a while now or all two
moves it to the left ok so just all to
not left this is something that I've
never found particularly useful
it's not new either this has been and
gigabytes BIOS all that's new here is
they've changed the skin so I'm not
really a hundred percent clear on why
this is such a big deal but the skin is
different so I don't know like here's
the thing you could do this and I guess
it's dynamic so maybe there's something
to that or you could put all this stuff
on this page which currently has nothing
on it except for menus so if you're
having if you have a menu which is then
full of menus you have to start doing
screwy stuff like putting in more menus
off to the side that are accessed by an
Alt key so I find this to be useful
information that is in the wrong spot
and I think that should move system ok
there's all standard we don't need to
worry about that and this is BIOS
version f5 i if you didn't see that so
next one BIOS what we have here security
options ok that's fine
quick boot options boot options this is
all standard stuff no complaints here
that tab makes sense peripherals looks
pretty normal as well I don't see PCIe
options in here ie switching to Gen 2
instead of Gen 3 to artificially limit
the lanes that would be kind of nice
maybe it's in the chipset options nope
these kind of belong together I think
peripherals and chipset I feel like you
could limit some of the sub menus here
and power which for again we have like
actual power options that are more at a
motherboard level a system boot level
and then we have the power options and
voltage options that are at the CPU
overclocking level so maybe some some
clarification of language would be good
for that a CPI or something I think that
covers all that stuff so that's that's
most of that PC health status this is
like more stuff that could just kind of
be at a top-level menu somewhere I like
if you're not going to put overclocking
options here you just you just gonna put
menus at least have like the health
status or the alt menu just all listed
here natively because that that would at
least get use of the menu miscellaneous
max link speed auto ok
that's actually what I was asking for a
minute ago so they do have that that's
good and I don't think that's neither
three mark enhancements not new you
there favorites okay smart fan we saw
that it's the same it's fine let's
switch back to easy mode so here's where
you get all the readouts that are in odd
places within the actual BIOS this is
the much less useful BIOS maybe I don't
know very new builders might like it it
looks pretty from a marketing standpoint
but we've never liked these every
company makes one to some extent it's
just they're not they're not
particularly useful at least we have
that's kind of weird you hit enter and
it just changes the profile but at least
you have access to that's that's weird
though DRM status so my select is on
DRAM status and hitting enter which is
really not clear at all even though I
just stumbled into it changes this thing
down here which looks like a different
option so excellent being able disable
that should just be like accesses XMP or
something boot sequence that's good to
have smart fan again it's pop-up but at
least this I like I like that they have
this successful in the easy menu because
that's probably the one thing that
everyone wants to change is the fan
speed the dr at the dram excuse me
speeds and stuff like that and i think
for the rest of the easy mode i don't
know I don't have any serious complaints
I find it not particularly useful for
myself but I could see it being used 12
for beginners and that's fine that's
what they're going for
so that's gigabytes new BIOS it's it's
the old BIOS with more orange and less
red and it's got the easy mode now so I
don't know I've it's there are a lot of
things that could be improved in
gigabytes bios it's not terrible like
here's the thing gigabyte baked some
really good boards these days at the
high end especially so they have
hardware that's perfectly fine some of
the gaming seven gave me nine series
which I think that Brandon's going away
now unfortunately I really liked it but
it's going way after everyone else did
the same thing don't know who copied her
but MSI also had gaming three five seven
whatever and I guess in they'll kind of
started anyway so Brandon changed but
previous gaming seven and nine
motherboards have been pretty good on
the hardware level BIOS is always been
weak for gigabyte it's usable
you can get what you want it's just not
the most advanced and powerful BIOS in
the world it's kind of difficult to
navigate and it's it's slow to work with
just from a human use case scenario not
in terms of loading or things like that
I actually didn't try moving the mouse
they fixed the mouse I don't know if
there's been any changes to the mouse
behavior but it seems okay we've had
previous gigabyte bios's where the mouse
would move on an XY grid and that was
infuriating even though you really
shouldn't be using a mouse in BIOS
anyway but if you're gonna have it at
least work it looks fine here so no
complaints about the mouse movement this
time but yeah a lot can be improved
nothing's really changed in a
significant way for the advanced mode
bios which for whatever reason it's
called the classic mode that's also
confusing so I get to this page I see ez
mode
I'm like okay I don't want that where's
that vance mode well I guess my only
other option is classic I don't want
that either because I know what that is
and I didn't like it I don't know
there's a lot that could be clarified
here and gigabyte has a lot of work cut
out for them the board I want to be
clear we haven't but we haven't reviewed
the board we have benchmarked it it
could be perfectly good on a hardware
level this is you can survive this you
can work with this it's not a big deal
if the BIOS is annoying to work with as
long as it has the features it needs and
from other people does so they're fine
there and as long as the vrm is good
we're gonna look at that but it seems
fine and it's got a real heatsink on the
beer I'm sorry I really like that could
job gigabyte on on pushing for real heat
sinks on motherboards again seriously if
you if you have a chance to praise
gigabyte for anything they've done it's
that heatsink cuz I'd like to see other
companies follow suit and giving them
credit work to do there is is definitely
they deserve that so job well done a lot
of stuff the PCH heatsink cover thin
it's kind of interesting with the way
the LEDs are laid out not really a thing
I talk about much but I do like their
implementation so like a hardware level
it seems like this is an okay product
and we'll review it later it's just that
I want to be clear on the BIOS level
there's a lot that can be improved and
this is gigabytes biggest weakness as
their BIOS wear ASIS it's their biggest
strength because price kind of starts
gaining issues a bit at the high end
