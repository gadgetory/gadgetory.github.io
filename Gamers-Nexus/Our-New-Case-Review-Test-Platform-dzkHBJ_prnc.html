about our new test bench the open air
tech station as it is called and you can
check the channel for that video but now
we're talking about our next new bench
for 2015 and onward and this is talking
about the bench that will be used for
all of our case reviews going forward
and these case reviews will be conducted
by Pascal agent he's a writer at our
site and also handles the social media
so let's go over the specs for Patrick's
test bench for all the case reviews
first of all we're using a micro ATX
motherboard and micro ATX is on its way
out it's sort of mini ITX or ATX at this
point but we're sticking with micro ATX
for now because there are still some
cases we want to review that our micro
ATX only and we want that versatility so
uses a z97 micro ATX board from as rock
and the cpu is a 4770k which we just
happened to have lying around so that's
what what ultimately went in the new
bench and for the cooler it's got one of
these on top of it this is a dark rock
three from be quiet say pretty beefy
cooler but not insane it actually will
fit in almost all the cases we review
it's only 160 millimeters tall so that
tends to be about the cut off point for
most cases some cases are 150 if we run
into those instances we'll figure out a
solution but this will work for most of
them fairly quiet and very cool for an
air cooler and this is definitely one of
the ones you would want to look at for
mid-range air cooling options so that's
our cooler that will be using in every
case which will impact the thermal
results if we decide to continue with
thermal benchmarks on cases which is
something I'll do a video about in the
future so that's the dark mark 3 we've
also got a gtx 960 for the video card
for this bench and that is the asus
strix 960 that we've reviewed and tested
an sli you can check all those videos on
the channel of course other than this
we've got some Kingston Genesis RAM in
there which is effectively fury memory
it's just the previous model we just had
some Genesis memory lying around so
threw that in there think it's clocked
at eighteen sixty six megahertz and it's
26 or four gigabytes so that's our Ram
motherboard cpu
cooler and video card for the power
supply we've also got a be quiet power
supply it is one of their dark power
units and it's 750 watts so yeah that's
a lot it's a lot more than we need for
this system but that's what they had
available and it gives us some Headroom
if we ever decide we want to use this
bench for SLI testing and extreme
overclocking things like that so what I
recommend is 750 I Paris by for a 960
and a 4770k no but that's not really the
point of a test bench it's not always
going to reflect exactly what the real
world user will build because we do need
that extra flexibility for changes as we
opt in different hardware the first case
that Patrick is reviewing is the s3 40
which is an NZXT case been out for a
little while now it came out shortly
after the h 4 40 next he will be
reviewing be quiet silent base 800 and
that is their new case it's their first
venture into the case world if we decide
to do any testing with this bench
outside of cases it will use the s3 40
as the permanent test bench case for
that system so to sort of update
everyone we've got several test benches
these days we have the one I just showed
you which is still running in an i5
3570k but that's okay because it's just
doing GPU benchmarks for games and FPS
and that one rotates video cards for all
the FPS testing we do on video games
we've got this bench which is a 4770k
system with a 960 permanent and this
cool are important because its case
testing that's doing all the case tests
and we'll investigate it for cooler
tests in the future but not sure about
that I might build a separate bench for
that and then we've got a mini ITX
system which I've yet to unveil that
will be used for separately testing all
the mini ITX enclosures because those
are sort of specific in their
requirements for a good enclosure and I
want to make sure we're testing that
with a different build than what we use
for testing ATX and micro-atx enclosures
so those are our benches to kind of get
everyone updated with the channel things
are going very well for the website I'm
pretty excited about it make sure you
check out the site www gamers nexus
donna if you
not check that out the channel of course
subscribe as always and we will see you
all next time peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
