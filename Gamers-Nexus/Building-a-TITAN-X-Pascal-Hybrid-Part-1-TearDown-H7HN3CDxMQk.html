bill this time with the Titan X so we're
gonna be tearing this thing down I've
already done the thermal tests in part
three of this video we'll look at the
thermal results of the non torn down
version that we this one versus the
hybrid version that we're creating
ourselves using this EVGA hybrid kit we
have a couple of these available and
basically just try and mod them onto the
cards ourselves if you haven't seen that
before so the goal here is to see how
much better we can make the thermals
because they're pretty high as is stock
and to that end can we further increase
the overclock with a 1080 we've got an
extra hundred mega Hertz out of this
thing
on the 1080 we'll see if we can
replicate that here before getting to
that this content is brought to you by
Iowa power and their new element gaming
PC which has arc LED fans and under glow
lighting with a large tempered glass
side window and this video is also
brought to you by Sam who's one of our
viewers and loaned this to us while we
were in England I was able to pick it up
and bring it back home for about a week
so we've got some time to do a hybrid
build and see how it works and that's
about it let's get into this thing so
first of all this video we're gonna take
this apart after the teardown we'll
build it back up into a hybrid card
hopefully and then part three we'll have
the results as normally so we can see
the thermal impact and all that stuff
this is a new tool kit this is not a
sponsored tool kit just a new one so
we've got a lot of things here I haven't
quite used them yet but let's see okay
just like the 1080 this uses a ton of
really tiny annoying screws that are
very easily broken at the shaft so we'll
have to try and avoid that this time
because it's not my card so I have to
care more about it so last few cards
give us a false sense of hope and that
the 1060 was a pretty easy hybrid build
other than the actual building part but
the the teardown was pretty easy and
this one it looks like we've got a
million screws to deal with so got to
keep better track of them where they go
not quite sure yet depends how this
build goes will that will dictate
whether or not this thing gets rebuilt
as the orig
card or if it gets left as a hybrid card
and Sam continues to use it that way it
just depends on if if it's mountable in
a case because as we've done in the past
sometimes the hybrid versions have teams
running out where the expansion slot is
that's fine for it open-air bench just
for testing and validation but obviously
does not work for home use okay so
there's part of the backplate that's the
same as the 1080 nothing special here at
all it look there's a thermal pad it
looks like well that's a very hell is
that
it's like cloth anyway thermal pad
covering that part of the card you can
take that off if you wanted to that idea
is to allow a better airflow if you were
to put these in SLI but really tested to
see if that is how it works obviously
power headers here six pin eight pin
solder points here and then on this part
we've got some solder points that are
unused for an eight pin if you wanted
out this side that's obviously not the
case here though and then we can see the
vrm is going to be where this is on the
other side of the card and we'll we'll
look at that once we take the full thing
apart
okay so there's the second half of the
back plate really just it's just a cheap
back plate it's really more meant for
aesthetic reasons than anything else
does just some level of structural
support with all those screws but very
tiny screws in some cases and has break
easily when you're reassembling if not
careful as we've shown in the previous
video so expansion slot cover thing is
still mounted that's got screws on that
side this has loosened the heat sink
which uses a vapor chamber on this
particular card and a blower fan which
is over here obviously see that right
there so now we've got to get into the
underside of the shroud and I'm
remembering what a nightmare the 1080
was to take apart so we've got these
tiny thins which I believe believe this
will fit over yeah so we can use this
learn learn that from the 1080 video app
sure trying to use pliers to take them
off so we can use that to take those off
I don't remember what order these come
out but doesn't really really matter all
that much let's let's get the rest of
the expansion cover off we don't need
that on there all right so that
simplifies things I think it's time to
start taking the shroud apart okay this
thing's not held on by adhesive I
remember that from last time I thought
it was held on by adhesive and then
snapped ours in half
okay so what will come apart and what
won't all right there goes that there's
the back half of the Shroud mostly no
function except one important function
these was actually pretty advanced
comparatively heatsink we'll talk about
that in a minute but these things as you
can see they go back in like that the
windows under the crowd obviously the
main purpose of these functionally
outside of the aesthetics part is to
guide airflow from this so the window
keeps it trapped under there so you
don't have you don't have air evacuating
from the system before it fully goes
through the entire what looks to be
aluminum heatsink so aluminum heatsink
here's actually Lewis I can take it out
in a minute
the air comes in the front blows through
comes out the back and that's exactly
what you want it to do there's the
cooler
it's a vapor chamber setup no heat pipes
but vapor chamber in this instance is
going to be better than a heat pipe
setup anyway just based on the design of
the heat sink in the cooler so that
obviously now it's there your air comes
in here this is the cold plate I'm not
positive if it's just like a nickel
plated copper or if it's just straight
aluminum but sometimes they they'll
nickel plate it although that doesn't
make a lot of sense or something you
don't see because the main point of
nickel plating is for looks not for
thermals and obviously there's no
exposed copper under the paste so that
instantly answers part of that okay so
here's the part here's the GPU itself
the GP is the shiny bit that's branded
as Nvidia made in taiwan' it
is GPU GP 102 - 400
so GP just quick refresh GP 102 that is
the actual GPU Titan X is not the GPU
Titan X is the video card GP 102 is the
GPU - 400 is its version of that GPU
just like 104 has 106 have 400 200
variants depending on what you're
looking at a 1 is the revision a in the
industry means that it is a consumer
model as opposed to X which is an
internal tested model and NVIDIA
branding around it you've got those
super tiny capacitors on the substrate
the green bits the substrate and then
this metal plate is probably just for
structural integrity so that's the GPU
ideally we leave the backplate or I
should say the base plate another back
plate ideally we leave the base plate on
here and then mount the cooler to that
as that would help us continue to cool
the vram and the RM without requiring
additional copper to be mounted to the
card which is kind of a pain to do and
not always effective but we'll see how
this goes we'll take a pic take apart
the rest first and look at it so we're
gonna take apart the base plate just at
least look at the card if nothing else
this is the other side of the shroud
because over here helps direct airflow
with this and then that is the LED power
so this cable is covered in electrical
tape here and connects to the LED and
that's really it that's all that does so
let's just get all this out of the way
if it were my card just pull on it pull
on it until it comes off okay so let's
go ahead and start taking apart the
underside so again the objective would
be to leave this base plate on here for
thermal reasons we are going to take it
off just to look at the card and then
hopefully it doesn't have too much
complexity to just get back on there and
leave it there with the cooler the only
reason that wouldn't work is if the like
with the what was it the 1060 if we have
an issue where that's just not gonna fit
because it's too wide in that case then
we do we just take it off around the
tasks and maybe put some aftermarket
theorem and vrm everyone this happened
last time oh that seems to happen with
the 1080 and Titan X specifically so
that's that's good that's a hot now we
can you can ignore that just do like
last time just unscrewed most the way
and then leave
okay that was a pain in the ass here we
go we've got VRAM modules let's pull it
this way so for the board some missing
circuitry over here a couple missing
spots that have not been filled
probably for cost reasons just to need
it or something like that and GPU proper
vram so two four six eight ten twelve of
those is twelve gigabytes so that means
they're one gigabyte modules or eight
Giga bits
it's normally how they are actually
listed and sold and these are made by
micron as one would expect so this is
gddr5 X as with the 1080 and micron is
the only current known manufacturer of
gddr5 X so that's what the memory is
this is the vrm MOSFETs capacitor bank
and it looks like it is a two-phase
memory it's either a two or three phase
memory vrm and then seven or eight phase
core vrm depending on what's going on
the rest of the board it's a pretty
extensive vrm set up based on what we
saw with the 1080 but it's still not
sure how far you'd get on that if you
were at extremely overclocked or
something like that but for our purposes
this is just fine because we're not
gonna be bypassing any electrical
restrictions or short aden shunts and
things like that so that's the set up of
the board I think that pretty much
covers all the core stuff this is the
fan or we've got a fan and an LED header
that's what these are that's for the fan
is PWM controlled by the needs of the
GPU based on temperature led you had are
pretty simple so that's that's the basic
as a board as far as cooling already
talked about the vapor chamber setup
that's what this is and this is the rest
of the cooling solution so you've got
the fan here that's screwed in through
the under
that's what this screw is here and
there's only two more probably under
this pad as well this pad is covering
the vrm I see can you even see the
imprint there of the MOSFETs
the inductors are the chokes which is
what these things are these are 22
labelled conductors are what protrude
through here those can withstand very
high heat it's basically coiled wire in
there and the kind of like a ferrite
core on a camera charger this is the
thermal pad for the capacitor bank vram
thermal pads one's missing that's
because it's still on the module and
then these other thermal pads here for
the rest of the components around the
board including the vram vrm which was
confusing to figure out the organization
of letters in my head in part two we'll
build this into a hybrid card that means
running mounting a liquid cooler to it
again gonna try and keep keep the
backplate the base plate and mount this
to the base plate if it does not work
we'll go like this and figure out a
solution for the rest of it just with
copper and things that we have around
and then we've got some copper shims if
we need them as well in the event that
the GPU is not tall enough to exceed the
height of the base plates sort of
recessed bracket so that's it as always
pay traveling the post roll video make
sure you subscribe so you see part two
where we build it up as I've made clear
in the past these videos are not
tutorials don't tear down your card
based on these videos or build one up
necessarily now once we get to the
results we can show you how well
normally liquid works we'll see if that
it remains the case here it was the case
with 1080 1060 and the rx 480 and I
should imagine would remain the case
here it just depends on how difficult it
is to mount the liquid cooler to it but
when we see these reduced thermals which
really should happen we'd normally go
down to sub 20 degrees C so somewhere in
the 16 C to 20 C range that's a delta
value so you add it in with ambient to
maybe 20 Celsius here in the 40s versus
adding with ambient in the 80s with the
reference cooler so pretty significant
difference
and it does remove the issue of thermal
throttling at certain thresholds they on
the cards like 85 86 Celsius for this
card it'll throttle its clock you leave
some performance you have some frame
reduction in the 1% 0.1% lose area but
that's all stuff we'll talk about in the
last video so thank you for watching as
I said a moment ago links to description
below patreon link emotional video all
that stuff and they give it to Sam for
letting us borrow this card I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
