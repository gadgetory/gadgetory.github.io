at CES in a glamorous hotel room i'm
joined by Jim Vincent jim was with me at
the computer history museum tour we did
previously in Mountain View California
and I wanted to show off at Jim's
brilliant setup for production while
we're at CES Jim do you have you have a
name for this setup that you have a poor
man's laptop the poor man's laptop we
have it so let's point out everything we
got a five dollar dell keyboard really
light dancing Zarah that they actually
for five bucks not bad yeah with
Chiclets which is our Chiclets with it
yeah it's ready real ratalie button haha
we got that we have an actual computer
not a laptop yeah many pcs that's the
zotac i reviewed one of those ages ago
yen something you need 60 I think
something like that in 16 right it's
just one of those it's 4k ready which
really doesn't mean anything well you
can run for KO puti parrot soda
television yeah with your masters of
orion game too that's right which i
think is made for 640 x 480 but yeah now
the bag of a run to whoa that's oh I
yeah I apologize haha have the back to
wireless antennas to connect to our one
megabit per second hotel Internet power
we have the keyboard of the mouse what
is our mouse it is an old logitech g9x a
logitech g9x always a good sign folks
when you have to check the name of the
mouse to see what it is and then this is
legitimately cool so this is a USB
detachable USB osb 1080p a sous mb 168
monitor which it goes through the same
type of USB 3 c on em hard drive yeah so
yes USB 3 straight to the box because
there's no monitor built into this
so tacky in it nice and late so it's
portable right and and it doesn't come
with a stand to gym it does but I never
figured out how to make it work it comes
with this lovely actually synthetic
leather case which is good to protect it
while flying but but instead you propped
it up against your backpack that's right
which has metal reinforcement in it in
case someone tries to knife it in Rob
your cam yeah this is one for you
traveling at reversible country right
what United States system alien by the
way let's let's walk through the rest of
the set up here you have a forty dollar
sixty dollar forty dollar old rivers in
one of the motorola android watch and I
think that's inductive charging which if
you don't know what inductive charging
is probably most people do it's just
metal to metal contact rather than cable
so you have that for some reason man
what is this uh this is an nvidia tablet
which i'm using to do computer books
here the shield Aurelio's of the shield
a one yeah which is actually pretty good
little tablet and then behind me there's
the Canadian Tire a power strip which I
guess we'll get b-roll of separately
hahahaha that we plug into the hotel
wall noun or what's the Noma brand Noma
yes very well respected yeah ah so
that's a that's Jim set up by suppose
that's what we got for CES we are that
professional production company I was
gonna say it to the gigabit power power
virus but giggle giggle dit giggle bit
he helped it you'll learn more about a
giggle bit at some point in the future
I'm sure maybe behind the scenes at
Taiwan haha that's what we got so that's
Jim's production setup he mostly reads
news and updates visual studio
apparently haha I'm fast internet it's
it's applying and acquiring
I've let you tether but I don't want to
waste the data on visual studio right
yeah this so generally one thing that is
actually kind of cool about this display
I work off of a laptop keygen works out
video production off of a larger 90 DM
laptop but my big bottleneck on mine is
screen space so you could actually hook
this up and use it as a second display
on a notebook that's how these markets
it as a second display for print out
books for notebooks or laptops yeah it
makes sense yeah so that'd be a kind of
sweet setup but uh let's how we're using
it here so thank you for watching I
guess yeah you can find coverage on the
channel I don't know when this video
will go up if it's after during CES but
there will be covered on the channel and
on gamers Nexus dotnet subscribe for
more convention coverage I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
