nexus tonight here at CES 2015 we were
at kingston and the HyperX suite here at
the at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas
first all this content brought to you by
cyber powers cyber vapor gaming pc right
now we're looking at pcie ssds and this
is actually an m2 or m3 hyperx predator
SSD that has been mounted to a PCB matte
black for PCIe usage so this operates at
1400 / allows in READ&amp;amp;WRITE megabytes
per second that's sequential and 100,000
hundred thousand I oh I ops read right
that's for ki ops pretty good
performance it's expected to release
late februari prices yet unknown and the
new savage SSD is coming out that is a
successor to the hyperx 3k SSD price
also unknown on that coming out shortly
after this drive but it should be good
for most gaming systems that can utilize
a say the drive if you don't want PCIe
again this is an m dot to drive so it is
not like the original pcie ssds like the
ocz revodrive that came out some time
ago it's quite a bit different and it's
just mounted to a PCIe card so you can
plug that into your pcie slot the cool
thing here they had a system setup where
from Lian Li the case where the the card
was actually displayed front forward so
that's sort of a neat way to do it and
finally this is using a Marvel
controller the new hyperx savage SSD
which is SATA will be using the Flies on
controller a lot of companies are moving
the flies on as of this CES we've seen a
couple other ones moving that direction
and we're still waiting on the San 4th
gen 3 products to start rolling out so
that's your update on the SSD market
right now at least as it pertains to
hyper x and we will see you all next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
