we're talking about PN why is gtx 980
accelerate pro and this is another gtx
980 video card so it's got the same GM
to a4 GPU as the MSI gaming 4G as the
reference card as every other 980 on the
market and that means it's got the same
TM use the same Rob's the same kuduk or
count basically everything is identical
to every other gtx 980 the only point
where a video card differentiates itself
from board partner to board partner is
the cooler which is pretty obvious the
faceplate and things like warranties
smaller stuff and then the pre
overclocked settings and this is a
fairly high pre-order cost card at least
compared to reference and compared to
the MSI gaming 4G that we had but there
that doesn't necessarily mean it over
clocks higher when manually tweaked the
pre overclock is not huge for any of
these video cards it doesn't necessarily
get you a big performance gain in terms
of frames per second you'll normally see
one two three which is within normal
variance of testing so that makes it
pretty hard to actually find a
difference when testing and so we end up
looking more at the cooler so the
thermal levels and the overclocking
Headroom if you're manually overclocking
and in this case the cooler is a dual
fan cooler
unlike the asus strix and damien 4g this
one does not use an idle cooling state
for the fans so they they remain active
basically all the time they are backlit
by LEDs but that doesn't impact the
cooling and then it's got a set of five
heat pipes back here not sure the size
on those they look about six millimeters
might be eight but five copper heat
pipes and then you have an aluminum sink
for the vrm and a video ramp and then
another aluminum sink for the GPU itself
and this unibody design blocks out air
intake from the front which was
something i was curious about if that
would be a problem in thermal testing
you'll see momentarily if it is and then
all of your intake comes in to the fans
and their push fans they're not the
squirrel cage fans that you find on
reference designs this card has a
backplate just like every other gtx 980
on the market or at least everyone that
I'm aware of currently and EVGA does
something a bit different they use two
flanking plates around the PCB so the
EVGA Super S even you
cards will have this like the gtx 960
this one is just one backplate it's a
proper backplate so you lose some of the
thickness of the card and that does make
it a bit less rigid but it's really not
an issue even at 11 or whatever inches
this thing is it doesn't work the board
or anything like that it's not heavy
enough so that is a non-issue in this
instance it's mostly an aesthetic stand
and speaking of aesthetics the faceplate
here is a metallic silver color it's
really we don't like talking on
aesthetics on the site so I'll just let
you look at the video footage for
yourself and decide if you like it or
not because that's really all that
matters does not affect performance and
jumping into performance Iran FPS
benchmarking software for several games
you can see all the charts here we also
did overclocking and thermal testing
which we'll see momentarily in terms of
frames per second the gaming 4G to the
reference card to the PMI card are all
generally within margin of error the
only place where this is not true is in
a game like grid or GTA where we
actually see the two aftermarket board
partner cards pull ahead of the
reference card but the gaming 4G and the
PMI card are still within the margin of
error of one of one another so that
doesn't really make a compelling
argument to buy either one just from a
pure performance standpoint and that is
something you'll find true with really
every video card on the market within
the same brand as we found with the GTX
at 960 s or I should say the same model
so I'll throw the other charts up here
so you can just check them out and then
link in the description below if you
want to read the full article with all
the benchmarking charts and data in
terms of thermals this video card
actually outperforms both reference and
the gaming 4G card and I originally
thought the gaming 4G card would be a
better performer in terms of thermals
but because it's fans idle they go to
zero rpm when it's under a certain
amount of load I think it's 30 watts it
actually has a higher idle temperature
it's about 37 Celsius before subtracting
ambient so that b-26 Celsius after delta
T and the PNY card is about 21 Celsius
delta T so it's it's six degrees cooler
idle and that means it is a bit cooler
under active cooling as well but it's
important to note that even the
reference card which is the warmest
here all of them are well within the
safe range for operating temperatures
for the GPU so there's really no major
gain one card to the other even though
this one does cool substantially better
than the others it's still not a big
enough difference read by the game in 4G
over the PNY card you need a lot more
than that overclock and we've got the
chart here with all of the frequency
overclocks on memory and core clock and
the p my card actually was the worst
overclocker it was about 16 megahertz
behind the reference card depending on
on how you measured your numbers the
reference card is actually a very high
performer and i think this is in part
because our reference card has a very
high ASIC quality the P my card was a
little bit lower ASIC quality which
means that the GPU is capable of
slightly less in terms of voltage levels
and frequencies and you can check ASIC
quality with gpu-z if you're not sure
what your card is and you're curious
that does help understand how far you
can push a video card before it starts
exhibiting instability the MSI card has
the highest overclocked
overall technique very impressive very
granular control and the piano my card
data sight cards at reference card they
all perform very closely just as they
did pre overclocked when you've
overclocked the card so again not a
major differentiating factor it's kind
of a boring thing that none of these are
glaringly different from the other but
that's the nature of same model GPU
reviews so where does differentiate
itself is with the warranty PNY it has a
one-year warranty at its base but if you
register the card it extends to a
lifetime warranty there aren't many
video card manufacturers who do this AMD
has a few like XFX I believe does this
but in terms of NVIDIA PMI is one of the
frontrunners for a good warranty it is
not transferable you have to register it
at all that stuff but it is somewhat
useful unless you're gonna replace your
card within a few years like most people
do the cooler is good even though it's
not a massive factor in selection it
does actually perform quite well so if
you're going to cram this into a small
htpc case where you don't have a lot of
active cooling from the case then it is
a fairly important item to consider and
then in terms of the pre overclocked
quality so it ships with overclocks
installed by the factory
and this means that if you're a user who
does not want to manually overclock your
video card that does have some value
especially because the pre overclocks on
the accelerate Pro are higher than the
gaming for G's pre overclock some higher
of course than reference and this does
make it an interesting Buy and worth
consideration for people who really have
no interest at all in manual
overclocking so that is the PNY
accelerate pro gtx 980 video card you
can check the link in the description
below for the full review of this card
and i've got a link to the product
itself in the description if you want to
