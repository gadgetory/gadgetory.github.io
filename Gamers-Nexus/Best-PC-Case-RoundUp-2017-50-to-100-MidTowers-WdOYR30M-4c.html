there lately but we decided to put one
together with actual thermal and
acoustic testing we're looking at the
best cases that have come through our
lab in the past year narrowed down to a
scope of 50 to 100 dollars of the
mid-tower requirement and these are all
on the market today this includes chart
toppers like the silverstone our l06 the
define C and the Corsair 270 R and for
more of the best cases that we've worked
with with a couple of honourable
mentions
before getting to those that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
their 1080p is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full sc2 review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080i
st2 the goal here is to go rapid fire
through the cases that we've found to be
the most appealing for one reason or
another in our actual testing of the
last year so that includes it things
that like thermals and acoustics but
also build quality and positioning in
the market overall so we go in over that
today if there are any of these charts
or cases that you find interesting check
our channel and website for full reviews
as those will contain the full charts
and all the depth that you would want on
the matter but we're going to go through
as quickly as possible for sake of this
roundup links for each of these cases
can be found in the description below or
in the full article on the website along
with our testing methodology if you're
curious about how that's conducted but
let's go ahead and start the low end
with a 50 to $60 range and work our way
up to 100 Corsair spec oh for in cooler
masters master box 5 start us off for
the round up being the two cheapest
cases of the laws for the Corsair spec
oh four runs about fifty dollars but add
another eight for an extra fan for this
one we'll show why in a moment the spec
of four is small lightweight and fitting
for an ultra budget PC that might
leverage something like a g4 560 or GTX
1050 class of hardware given the price
point the case is reasonably well built
so as illustrated in our charts like
this chart showing TV performance when
using these stock configuration versus
two of our aftermarket configurations
adding a fan is absolutely worthwhile
for a ton more data on this case see our
full review but for something simple and
a budget build it's really not a bad
starting point the master box 5
meanwhile gets an honorable mention for
its unrestricted
take modularity and low price at $60
cooler masters Master box five resolves
some of the airflow problems of other
cases on the bench by including the two
120 millimeter fans and optional mesh
front and additional installation
configurations for builds of various
types moving on to the next price
bracket there were a few potential
candidates from Corsair for this round
up so we included two one was the spec
of four and this one is a 270 yard
270 our one our editors choice award at
last year for its quality and price when
it launched in 2016 it's easy to build
in not too flashy and the cooling is
good when tested in our thorough
benchmarks $60.00 for the non windowed
variant isn't bad though you lose a fan
but the extra ten bucks per window and
additional fan is perfectly acceptable
despite entering the s3 40s price range
it's not wild or exotic we even combined
its review with the more visually
exciting 570 X but the to so many our is
one of the safest bets on the market
right now in terms of price to
performance in our testing as you can
see here we found that see Sony arts be
adequately cooled with our configuration
landing between the noise focus defiance
II and thermal chart-topping Silverstone
our l06 in fact thermals were good
enough that even at reduced our PM's
like 1000 to 1200 rpm on all case band
we would still be in good cooling
performance range provided reasonable
cooling on the core components like the
GPU cooler always had our test
configuration running under 37 DBA when
tested with the Twin Frozr cooler at 55%
of the CPU cooler at 1,100 rpm which
really isn't bad at all of course we
can't talk cooling without mentioning
Silverstone's our l06 right now cooling
is 100% the priority of the our l06 Pro
even an hour torture workload
silverstone $75.00 our l06 pro is the
competition to Beach for CPU cooling in
this price bracket and that remains true
even when reducing fan rpm to a thousand
rpm as seen in this charged GPU cooling
is much the same story as the previous
chart with the Silverstone case a few
degrees lower than the next closest
competitor
even if we look to our new blender
benchmarks with a CPU worker going at
full utilization Silverstone places
several degrees cooler than these
somewhat open core p3 noise of them to
priority for silverstone considering its
43 DBA output with our component
internally but we have so much thermal
headroom that we can
down 2,000 rpm and land under 40 DBA and
our config the three front fans and mesh
front panel made the RL zero six the
best cold enclosure we've tested this
year and March to return to roots with
mesh paneling rather than the new noise
focus that often features flat panels as
it's become more and more acceptable to
eliminate five and a quarter drives from
cases it's also become possible to
shrink case footprints and increase
front intakes aesthetic results are a
matter of opinion especially with this
case as up to you but the performance
results are definite it works well the
interior is very basic and plain but
Silverstone included fans add a lot of
value to the total package as a bonus
the PMO one from silverstone has the
same three intake and one exhaust layout
it's similar in quite a few other ways
in fact careful observers might note how
much of the chassis and tooling is
exactly the same you like both cases but
the differences between the two is
mostly in appearance are all the 0 6 of
course is also cheaper silverstone
therefore takes a no frills approach if
that's your thin the RL 0 6 is a worthy
contender under $100 in win meanwhile is
an all frills company as far as anyone
is concerned fans are thrilled
so is cooling in general and also
anything that is aluminum or animatronic
like the H tower the n1 3 or 3 of those
simplifies things and drags down price
to $90 which for a win is quite a feat
we were impressed by the solid
construction glass in one point two
millimeter thick steel with panes
included results in a total weights of
24 pounds sturdy cases in this price
range with big glass panels rather than
small acrylic windows are uncommon we
would like to see better cable
management and support for wider
radiators on the 303
but overall the 303 manages a good
enough in the performance Department
while still looking great the biggest
obstacle in the original review was the
lack of any fans included but
considering the quality of many stock
fans that may be a good thing in for a
case with fans and then replacing them
is more expensive overall this is a case
you buy for it looks but be sure to grab
a couple case pans with it one upshot of
being a solid metal and glass box is
relative silence in the least and with
that note of silence it's time to move
on to fractal and their $90 defined see
we've been interested in review in fact
those cases for a while and finally got
our chance with a define C this is a
no-nonsense boxy case with a focus on
performance in the noise department like
the rest of fractals lineup but with a
small footprint and some acoustic foam
it's a stripped down chassis and that's
many cases are mediocre because they try
to do everything but the define see
instead focuses on doing a couple things
very well there are only two hard drive
bays no five and a quarter bays and no
wasted space whatsoever
Kayle management was easy and the whole
installation process was pleasantly
simple their old tests weren't
incredible but the advantage of the
defined sea is its size build quality
and the noise suppression that doesn't
impede too much on performance on our DB
a charge fractals define C was the
quietest case without the word quiet in
the company name leaving that badge
firmly in the hands of German
manufacturer be quiet define C is about
as small as a case can get while still
fitting a full ATX board and lands in
its spot securely in our best of roundup
moving now to one of the more expensive
cases in this listing the $90 MDX es 340
elite fancies itself something of a
luxury case in the market and to be fair
it was one of the first $100 cases with
tempered glass paneling making it one of
the cheaper options when that fad
started bass 340 Aleta is a good looking
case and it preserves many of the
features we like them the original ass
340 which we still think is one of the
best cases made and that particularly
includes a good cable management the
elite model got our recommendation based
on this and its most obvious new feature
a tempered glass side panel revealing
the tidy interior and new prominently
placed as a steam out and the air T
expanded the cable management bar made
slight tweaks to the s3 40s already good
features and stuck a sheet of glass on
it and call it a day not so bad
functionally the elite is identical to
the original except for the extended
side panel at the cost of air intake
thermals were therefore unimpressive and
the included rubber puck has become the
bane of our existence and a tit-for-tat
skirmished with NZXT but the cable
management and looks make up for it with
the right build that alone gets s340 on
the charts Roseville is Cullinan is a
close competitor at $110 and gets an
honorable mention the case improves on
thermal performance over NZXT s340 elite
by way of brute force as we can see in
our torture chart that's on the screen
now but it loses some of the finer
touches of the elite those are good
considerations with NZXT is taking the
win for the best cable management
features currently in the industry
Sarala takes t-series enclosures our
unique simple case
is suitable for tradeshows or fancy
liquid cooling setups surprisingly
despite being made for high-end
enthusiast audiences then we'll take
charge as a modest price the open frame
of the p3 doesn't support fans anywhere
except for the radiator mount but it
doesn't need them even with an air
cooler enough ambient air circulates
through to properly cool components
modular parts are included for liquid
reservoir mounting their even parts for
different PCIe card configurations like
basing outward versus vertical or
horizontal mounting laying the case
sideways is another option stand it up
of course or even while mounting it
though shouldn't be much of an issue for
the case as long as it's mounted high
enough on a wall or only used for shows
but there's a filter behind the radiator
mount so if you do make use of that that
will hopefully help out we can show you
our noise testing short with this case
on it and will but because there are no
included fans when the body doesn't do
much to contain noise the noise output
depends entirely on your component to
figure out noise levels for the case
plug a radiator fan in and listen that's
the noise level thermals though we're
good as we see in this CPU torture
charge the p3 places toward the top
third of results showing that open air
remains one of the best solutions the
only option that best the open
configuration is of course directed
airflow in the RL 0 6 or acting the
acrylic wall on the p3 to us this is one
of the best cases available if only for
its affordable test bench configuration
options
the p3 can be used as a hot swap
component rig for open-air testing which
can't be said for anything else other
than true open-air benches and many of
those like the ones we have are $200 or
more and on that note I've just come to
the realization that we spent about
$1,000 on open-air benches in the last
few years so they are expensive but an
open-air bench is Anessa what everyone
wants there are plenty of actual closed
enclosures real enclosures like this one
in the list hopefully that helps you all
out there are several honorable mentions
we cannot reasonably include everything
many of you will surely comment below
and note the cases that you like that
were left out but these are the ones
we've tested they've come through our
lab and we've had time to validate them
and figure out what needs improving if
anything of course there's always
something like the spec before in its
fan or just what you should look out for
other honorable mentions not in this
core content would
the Corsair 400 C which is about a
hundred bucks it competes with this
directly the NZXT s340 elite but it's
got a bit of a different take on its
overall layout so check our 400 C review
for that they also have the 600 C if
you're a corsair fan and want to see
what they did with that one but if
you're not necessarily into the coarser
stuff there are still plenty of other
options Silverstone's pmo one is a more
expensive version of the RL zero six
that we looked at to some extent there
are plenty of other cases on the market
from inland that are more expensive all
kinds of options in the 100 200 dollar
range but for today's list this will get
us started we'll revisit this topic soon
because we'll be at copy tech so if
you're not subscribed to subscribe now
that we can follow our coverage there we
