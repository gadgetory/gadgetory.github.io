Jian we shot three today one of them is
on the patreon channel if you go to
patreon.com/scishow Nexus is a bonus
episode the other ones both will be on
this main channel so you can check those
out if you have questions for next week
post them in the comment section below
and I'll try to get to them that we do
get quite a lot we have some really good
questions this time one of them my
favorite one I'm not going to be able to
answer directly today but it prompted a
really cool interview that we'll have
coming up hopefully in the next week or
so and that is going about the about
Intel's ten nanometer struggle featuring
hopefully David Cantor from real-world
Tech I'll tell you more about that in a
moment before that this video is brought
to you by EVGA a 19th anniversary
giveaway EVGA is giving away over
$80,000 of components and it's retro
themed that 19 year anniversary
including two signed GN mod mats and
also several full systems GPUs
motherboards and more to participate
click the link in the description below
to start EVGA scavenger hunt screenshot
competition or gaming events click the
link below to learn more
alright so before starting quick news on
everything news update as always we
restocked our blueprint logos if you
were interested in them they sold out
twice they're finally back hopefully
they'll stay for a while now and we're
hopefully not that your perspective and
we also have the mod mats are in stock
and shipping now so if you buy they are
actually going out the door as orders
come in now they're not backordered
anymore final item before we start this
posters brand new we really like the
design of it it's a video card Anatomy
poster so it's just kind of cool if you
want something that shows like MOSFETs
chokes and all that kind of stuff
capacitors on it and explains where they
are on the board we have them on the
store store die Kara's next to sign up
for all of those things alright let's
get started properly first question I'm
gonna tell you what it is and we're
going to come back to it in a few days
this question is from uncle curse burp
who asked what do you think of Intel
struggle at 10 nanometer and AMD moving
to 7 nanometer with TSMC Intel CEO had
to resign over the 10 nanometer struggle
and they may truly be in trouble with
the constant 10 nanometer delays in
terms of AMD being able to deliver a
more efficient product to the semi cost
a market for
reference here's a link and they link a
semi accurate story not saying the story
semi accurate it's that's the name of
the website so David Cantor if you
haven't seen him on our channel before
we spoke with him about the sort of
misnomer that is the phrase coup de
coeur so we talked about what is really
a coup de coeur isn't appropriate to
call it a corps and we also have talked
with him about CPUs talk to them about
the SSD market so canter is a leading
expert analyst he is a an actual
technical analyst not just a market
analyst he runs the website real world
tech comm doesn't get as many posts but
that's because each one is pretty
in-depth previously wrote for
microprocessor report and runs the real
world Tech forums as well so canter is
by all accounts an expert and can talk
to this subject in a great way for our
audience so I asked him do you want to
contribute an answer for this episode we
got to talking about it and basically
decided you know what screw this let's
just do a whole video on it because it
would have been only two to three
minutes whereas we can go fold that for
the video so we'll have him on a just a
Skype call pretty soon hopefully and
quick quote from him when I was speaking
on the phone with with Cantor about this
idea he said ten nanometer is a little
bit of a mystery to everyone what's the
back-up plan so I think that's a that's
a pretty good hook for the interview
we'll do later on subscribe if you want
to catch that basically I wish I had an
answer this episode but I I really would
love it's just dutiful like 15-20
minutes on it rather than three so next
real first real question I guess does
heat degrade CP is more than pure
voltage and this was posted by Stefan
Svensson who said I've heard different
things from different sources but those
heat degrade CP is more than pure
voltage and put into the CPU freeze
differently can one safely input higher
voltages into the CPU as long as the
temperature is low or will the high
voltage degrade the CPU regardless of
low temperatures I reached out to both
Roman or Bauer and builds what about
this Roman we'll probably be talking
with him separately I don't know if
it'll be a separate video or not or if
I'll just revisit it next week
but builds I'd had an answer he was
immediately available there Bowers was I
was busy with work so build so I'd said
and I'll expand on this on my own
but he said both are exponential as in
the rate of degradation at like 150
degrees Celsius is really really fast
compared to 100 degrees Celsius
similarly 2 volts might kill a chip
instantly when compared to 1.75 so to
expand on builds roids answer the reason
I reached out to these extreme
overclockers exos years is because
although I can speak to this from most
practical standpoints these guys are
bringing CPUs under it's under liquid
nitrogen they're pushing high voltages
so they've got the really extreme
version of the answer for you so both
are exponential has builds Lloyd said to
expand on his answer though so it does
heat the great CP is more than just pure
voltage it depends on what part of the
cpt are talking on if you're talking
about the CPU core that's one thing
let's talk first about another component
though the IMC or the SOC on if you're
talking AMD so the integrated memory
controller has its own voltage and on
Intel the IMC if whenever you're working
with let's say memory overclocking
you're having trouble stabilizing a
memory Yoseob you might need to push
your system agent voltage on Intel or
your SOC voltage on AMD same idea over
all different names slightly different
well actually different applications as
well but same idea so if you have to
push the SI or the SOC voltages up this
is an instance where although your
temperatures could be perfectly fine and
well well with inspect pushing the
voltage on either one of these two
specific areas SOC or the IMC can cause
serious degradation on the IMC over time
so if you start pushing let's say 1.4
volt system agent on Intel on modern
Intel like skylake architecture and
onward then absolutely voltage will
cause degradation on the CPU not the
cores but the memory controller so
pushing 1.4 si over time to stabilize
your memory overclock eventually and
this could be a couple months it could
be six months probably not longer than a
year though almost certainly under a
year if you're at one point 4 volts
probably within six months but at some
point there will be degradation and that
degradation manifests in a primary way
either well mostly requiring more
voltage now to sustain the same clock or
you're just not able to ever hit that
clock again and you have to drop clocks
but keep the same voltage or you drop
really hard and you lower the bowl to an
appropriate safety level so that is one
area where just pure voltage can cause
serious degradation without necessarily
having the heat component at least not
presented to you through core
temperatures something else that's hot
but adjust the voltage plus the heat on
that component where you can't get an
IMC temperature and any sauce for that
I'm aware of that is the that's one
component of your question the other
component is yes actually four cores
four V cords but different you can push
pretty high voltages and typically under
most normal user scenarios I'll define a
moment typically you will hit a thermal
limitation before you hit a deadly
voltage typically not always so when I
say normal user scenario I mean it's not
deleted you didn't put liquid metal on
it it's out of the box thermals as you
might say and pulling that CPU out of
the box put it into a socket and I'm
putting a cooler on it that's maybe like
240 millimeters max for a radiator or an
air cooler under those conditions it's
pretty likely that you are going to hit
a thermal throttle scenario before you
start hitting really seriously deadly V
core and I mean in most cases we've
tested with like coffee late with a six
core or something you might hit thermal
throttle at one point for two volts
which is around where you kind of cut
off for safety anyway maybe one point
four or five which isn't all that much
worse but start pushing any deadly
amount of voltage is is going to require
more exotic cooling or D LEDs and things
like that but there's still the other
part of your question okay
so I'm not running a deadly voltage but
my temperature is really high well for
the most part especially on Intel and
AMD CPUs are a bit different
Intel CPUs have currently basically zero
response to temperature except for a my
throttling or not it's very its binary
it's like it's a bit just basically a
boolean question
of am i a hundred degrees or on some in
my 105 degrees if no then let's just
keep running the clock as high as it can
if yes we'll drop it back until we
sustain t.j.maxx or temperature junction
max and in those cases of Intel CPUs you
can run like 90 degrees pretty much
without problems for a very long time
the degradation there is it's very
difficult to plot we don't have a real
answer it would take years and years of
testing and dozens of CPUs at that
sustained temperature to really know the
answer but 90 degrees is not that bad
now it's it's not a number people want
to see generally yeah even it was just
an OCD thing you might want to see like
80 or something like that but 90 is
reasonable it's just that I mean it's
not it's not a pleasing number it's just
it's not killing your CPU literally
though and the voltage in theory if
you're under like 1.42 is gonna be fine
as well for V cores just watch out for
SA and SOC and these got a bit of a
different temperature scale can't
remember it off the top of my head
because they have a few different swings
so like AMD is TDP suggests it's
calculated partially on temperature as
you would expect and because they are
directly related TDP for Andy is assumes
an optimal temperature of about sixty
point eight degrees Celsius for the
cores and beyond that point you start
getting some D rating sort of TDP
worsens that's pretty normal and the
also their CPUs do have more issues
sustaining overclocks once you get into
the 80s especially once you're into the
90s so that doesn't mean it's bad
doesn't mean that Andy's worse or better
than Intel it means they approached
differently so this particular aspect is
not a better or worse it's a these
things work differently but to answer
your question well I think I read it but
build Joy's answer covers the extreme
and with Ellen 2 and extreme high
voltages where as he said 2 volts might
just straight kill a chip but you're
never going to hit 2 volts docking at
one point seven five volts heat there
it's very unlikely I'll even do 1.5
volts if it's not deleted with liquid
metal and you're not eating some extreme
cooler like a giant water cooler or
chiller or something like that
it's for the most part you will probably
thermal throttle before you kill
something with voltage that's not always
true though see the entire rest of this
answer for why hopefully that gives you
a pretty good outline I feel like that's
fairly complete
there's dummy more there but hopefully
that helps next question and our thanks
to builds wide from actually hardcore
overclocking by the way for helping with
the answer you can check him out
actually hardcore overclocking on
youtube not to be confused with actually
running stock which was his other side
channel our mining GP is safe to buy use
those from guy in Vera who asked now
that mining rigs are being chopped up
and sold off are those GPUs safe to buy
or should they be avoided but like the
plague well assuming it's not one of the
ones that was hit by the flood in China
let's just do that was it's ignore those
first the idea of mining GPUs so I the
concern here I would assume is hey this
thing's been running a hundred percent
load for its whole life does that mean
it's degraded in any serious way and the
answer kind of depends whenever you're
talking used obviously there are million
variables we don't know what the owner
did I have no idea how well they took
care of it whatever so any answer I give
you is not going to be a blanket yes or
no as far as would I buy a mining GPU
used let's see that if the price is
significantly reduced and I feel like I
have recourse as a buyer then yes I
would consider I use mine in GPU however
I I've got kind of my own any like
personal idiomatic ways of or
idiosyncratic ways I should say of
dealing with this stuff so my
idiosyncrasies for this kind of scenario
I just always feel a little uneasy
buying used but that's not nicely for a
logical reason it's just I mean it kind
of is based on logic but I like the idea
of knowing that there's a warranty there
the component could fail for any reason
it might not even be the miners fault it
might just have been eventually waiting
to fail because there's something bad on
it so I don't personally like buying
used parts if I can avoid it
but there's
absolutely totally an argument for why
you should do it we buy you stuff for
business like tables chairs all that
stuff all the time so I totally
understand it I don't want to like say
that you should and I'm just saying that
keep my perspective in mind which is
that I feel uneasy doing it myself which
means that I feel really uneasy
recommending anyone buy use because if
something happens I don't want to be
responsible for it
so with that disclaimer out of the way
you take on the risk all that stuff
let's talk about the real technical
aspect of this technically a mining GPU
has been under maybe a hundred percent
load for its whole life when a miner is
presumably working in optimal scenarios
they should have the GPU under power
target so typically miners we run 7080
percent power target something like that
I don't know exactly but it's it's below
100 percent it's certainly not over
clocks like on or twenty percent power
because you instantly lose all of the
the profit margin there on power so
they're running below power target in
theory the fans are also running kind of
fast so hopefully if there is a dead
component soon it's going to be a fan
not like a cap or something so in theory
the fans are running fast power targets
low vrm shouldn't be too abused the
memory vrm might be a bit abused if they
overclock the memory and memory via arms
weaker that's certainly true in a lot of
cars the core vrm gets way more focused
so it's possible that the memory vrm
gotta be used as possible that it ran a
bit hot but MOSFETs can take like a
hundred twenty-five degrees Celsius
before there's any real Assyria's
problems and doctors same thing so then
what components are we concerned about
well MOSFETs can pop even though they
can run high temperatures but that might
just be a bad batch so it's really hard
to distinct to draw a line
distinguishing between mining abuse and
what is going to fail anyway capacitors
are where your real concern is
especially anything that's kind of
located in a hot spot on the card where
there might not be air flow because the
cooler designs bad so this comes down to
a lot of assumptions like we're assuming
that the cooler is pretty good to begin
with we're assuming that everything's
getting decent air flow
we're assuming the miner was running it
at maybe below the power target and thus
below the temperatures this is what
you'll hear a lot from miners it's well
it was it was below the load that's on
gaming it would have it and it's not
thermal cycling so it doesn't have the
abuse of thermal expansion and
contraction constantly through its life
like it would with game and it was just
a hundred percent always-on and there's
absolutely some truth to that but it's
it's also not quite that simple so if
you have a capacitor on the board that's
not getting good airflow and it was in
Iraq in China where there's not like
necessarily it's higher temperature just
ambient temperatures higher maybe they
had a whole bunch of GPUs in a line
whatever if it's in kind of poor
conditions it's possible that a
capacitor could be running at 105
degrees Celsius it's not too common
capacitors time to get these and cooling
from the fans but if that's the case if
it's a bad pool or whatever then
absolutely you could buy a car that has
a cap nearing end of life 105 Celsius
maybe some caps are gonna be 5,000 hours
something like that so if you're running
24/7 105 C it's gonna die inside of like
a year but 105 sees a whole lot and it's
not that common that caps get that hot
we typically see them in the 60s to 80s
in like a hundred percent load 100%
power target gaming scenario or like a
prime crunching type or a power buyer
scenario so the answer to your question
is this is really hard to answer and
there are a lot of things to consider
and we're making a lot of assumptions
one of them is that the cooler doesn't
suck if it's a card that has a bad
cooler and it was being used 100 percent
of the time even with reduced power
consumption from miners who set up
properly it could still be a risky buy
because if the coolers bad it doesn't
matter what the miners did at some point
you've got stuff that's getting hot even
though they're not pulling as much power
as normally it's still in a higher
temperature than then your average room
ambient temperature in most serious
cases so I don't know I would say yes it
is worth considering buying a used
mining GPU
there's a good chance that it was under
less strain that a lot of used gaming
GPUs in some instances but in those
instances where it was under more strain
than the average gaming GPU it was a
hell of a lot more strain so you're more
likely to see a failure it's just by
somewhere where you've got some buyer
protection I know there are going to be
people who take issue with this answer
because they're gonna be people who are
miners who feel or people who bought use
mining GPUs and say my anecdotal
evidence suggests it's completely ok and
I agree with you
it's definitely completely ok if you get
lucky but it's also easy to get screwed
over and you just don't know what you're
buying it doesn't have like a CARFAX
report or something like that
so until we know we have a way to know
what you're buying I feel uneasy
suggesting it but I would say that
there's a good chance you're okay
it's just when it's not okay it will be
a catastrophic failure and that's how
GPUs failed by the way it's not like
performance degradation it's not going
to be you buy a 1080 as performing like
a 1070 it's gonna be you buy a 1080 and
either works great and you never notice
that was use remaining or it doesn't
work that's probably gonna be the two
modes you get GBS don't really degrade
and performance like in gaming they just
have they work fine until they don't and
that's because when they don't it was a
catastrophic failure capacitor died
MOSFET blew up something like that but
anyway in the very least PI just
replaced their own place so hopefully I
covered all my basis there and addressed
most of the definitely going to be
posted criticism of the answer I'm sorry
if you don't agree I did my best to
cover all possible angles of it so
hopefully I got the angle that you cared
about but anyway that's that's you asked
my opinion that's how I feel about it
it's not a hard fact necessarily that
you should or shouldn't buy one next one
prime95 vs. ADA so Devin Dykstra says
when I was overclocking my CPU I noticed
an odd phenomenon when I overclocked it
to high 8 of 64 and prime both crashed
my system but when I ran stress tests at
the same time it was stable I would
think that running both
would put even more stress on the CPU so
what's going on here they actually won't
you should only use one real stress
testing program if it's going to pull
100% of resources for the component of
testing so you should use either only
prime or only ADA I don't particularly
like ADA's stress testing tests so I
would suggest most other things prime95
smaller 50s I would suggest blender is a
good one too that's a realistic one if
you don't like prime because it's not
super realistic blender uses a VX it's
still really abusive it's not quite as
abusive as small F of T's and prime so
using both you're gonna run into an
issue with thread scheduling where
Windows is bouncing between the two
applications and windows basically sees
two applications calling for a hundred
percent resources and Windows is sitting
there freaking out trying to figure out
how I can keep both of these
applications running simultaneously and
so the solution is to do thread
scheduling and the switch resources back
and forth between them so you're
toggling stuff on and off you're putting
stuff in memory you're pulling stuff out
of memory and all of that means that you
have a lot of CPU downtime while Windows
is trying to keep both applications
running rather than just saying you know
what I can't handle this I'm gonna give
all my attention to prime in which case
you would have the first scenario you
described so what it's doing instead is
it's trying to keep both running you're
getting the prioritization and the
threads switching between the
applications memory is being used and
dumped and that means that you're going
to end up with a sort of like false
sense of stability so just use one
application next one is from a fourth
tuna who says can GN possibly review
gaming mice it's known in cyber sport
enthusiast community that even among top
tier game you know my sensors button
switches do differ in effect performance
players collect data based on reviews
and personal experience there's a lack
of expertise about sensors their
technology and parameters we've done a
couple of videos with people like Chris
pate from Logitech who's a great
engineer NPM
about sensors the trouble with reviewing
mice we used to do a lot of peripheral
reviews but we got out of it and it's
because they're so damn subjective it's
just it's really hard
as someone who these days tries to lean
on data and data collection it's hard to
review something subjective and feel
confident in my conclusion because
ultimately the thing with subjectivity
is that people won't agree with you and
that's fine but it's different when it's
something like that personal like a
mouse where like a game review if you
read game reviews and you think I don't
agree with that critic at all that's
fine you don't have to like call them
names for it it's just that in the
future you know that you shouldn't be
reading that critic because they might
not like the same kinds of games as you
do so it's important for subjective
reviews to find someone who has the same
style as you and typically agrees with
you as opposed to what most the internet
thinks which is that you need to be
constantly at odds and adversarial with
everybody so my street views fall under
that category it's really hard to do
right there are ways to do technical
testing you can test the latency you can
test input response time we've done it
but we worked with Logitech to do it and
we don't have a permanent set up for
that so I've thought about it
I would love to review mice and a
technical fashion that's like repeatable
way to collect data but it's just not
something we can do right now like I
mean what are you gonna do test button
endurance and get a pneumatic arm to sit
there and push the button 50 million
times and then you have one sample so
it's really hard to do and we got out of
it but I'd love to look at my skin it's
just I don't have any present plans that
said if you have ideas I'm not a mouse
enthusiast anymore I don't have the time
to be anywhere so if you kind of spend a
lot of times on forum time on forums and
you look at these user reviews of it let
me know what kind of data the people
collect is it objective if it's
objective data that I can maybe collect
myself let me know and we can look into
it for next time if it's subjective let
me know what that is - but just
I'm probably not going to test it if it
is to more good full tower case is
George Lambros says host IVA hope you're
doing well I am thank you very much I
know you mostly cover mid tower cases
but do you plan on reviewing some full
tower cases as well I made the mistake
six years ago to buy the 800 D and now
educated me I ripped the drive cage
apart for to 140 fans in the front glued
Silverstone air filters on the front
that's cool now I have much better
temperatures but that means all my seven
drives are in the air held by cables or
sitting on the bottom of the case thing
it's time to upgrade so which one would
you recommend except the half while the
half X is kind of old anyway so I don't
really feel great about recommending it
anymore
but okay so I was reading the rest of
this a few things here I also have
drives on the bottom of my case and I
shouldn't but I do
you you've got a couple options if you
want to keep the full Tower approach
which I completely get I actually
personally prefer full towers and use
them myself then there are a few options
the dark base pro 900 s out there as you
mentioned that's one of the better ones
we've looked at lately the view 71 is a
fairly big case I guess it's not
technically a full tower and I don't
remember how many drive cages it has
sorry but look into the view 70 wanted
performed way better than we thought it
would and it is full tempered glass case
but it has enough gaps that actually
perform pretty well so that's also a
big-ish dark base pro 900 for sure the
biggest we've looked at lately see 700 p
we actually decently liked the cosmos
see 700 P I know a couple of other
reviewers really didn't like it and it
is kind of clumsy to work with if you
want to invert it I would just suggest
not doing that but it's a large case
does have some not great air flow but
you can you can work around it with that
one that's the upside those are really
that's that's what I got for you case
labs if you have a ton of money like 500
bucks you can buy a case labs case and
never buy another case ever again but
they are expensive up front
and hopefully get you set up for a long
time they're also better for water
cooling so that's kind of that's what I
got in mind we look at a lot of cases
positive I'm forgetting full tower cases
I know I am so for those of you who keep
a good eye on full tower cases please
post them below so that George can take
a look through your suggestions but
George those are mine it's basically
looking at case labs just so you know
what's out there
but don't go in planning the buy one
because they're expensive look at the
dark Bass Pro 900 if you don't like it
that's fine but I actually did quite
liked that case personally the c7 harpy
is okay but it's got some problems and
I'll think about others but if you 71
maybe that's what I got for you right
now I think alternatively you go mid
tower and get like a small box or build
another small system and do an ass and
just do network attached storage and
then you could put it on a gigabit or 10
gigabit line 10 gigabits probably bit
expensive so maybe gigabit locate it in
your room with the router and you've got
network attached storage and now you can
have a smaller case that's an
alternative for you to think about there
are NASA's that are sold for relatively
cheap that are fairly all-in-one most of
them won't have the failures we had
recently last one goes to pilot how
often are you able to make it to a bike
track do you bring your own bike or rent
do you have a favorite and is there one
you are looking forward to visiting so
Whistler is probably one of my favorites
I got to go so when this there's a
season for downhill season and it's
typically like May maybe June through
like October and at that point all the
cherry lips closed and it becomes winter
parks except for a couple of parks that
are actually some not far from us that
are year-round
so I try to bring my own whenever I can
if it's on the East Coast and I can
access it by car I definitely do that
I ride local jump lines I don't know if
we'll put a picture in but I have photos
of like giant jump tracks we have
locally and stuff like that so those are
great but they don't have trailers so
push the bike up write it down to the
jumps or local mountain lines so I get
out pretty regularly for just like trail
riding locally and just and jump tracks
locally a couple times a week I try to
do for like an hour or so each time hour
or two just to keep saying it really
helps me stay focused on the site if I
go out there
and just do a bunch of jumps for like an
hour and just do nothing but session
jumps it clears my head completely and I
can think about what I want to
accomplish for the day for the site so
as often as I can
downhill riding requires driving or
flying but I do get out a good amount of
weekends through the summer and I bring
my I bring two laptops I'll edit a video
or schedule them for posting and write
articles while I'm there so I I still
worth like four to eight hours a day but
that's a lot less than normally so it's
it's like a mini break but not that much
of one and buying or renting I try to
bring my own bike if I can if it's in
like Whistler like where I did the
recent video then I rent there because
it's just it's too expensive and there's
damage waiver so I don't have to worry
about damage because not my bike and
there's damage waiver so yeah favorite
probably Whistler in Canada I've ridden
in Taipei after Computex I've gone twice
now and that's pretty fun I like in
Taoyuan I like mammoths in California
snowshoe Bryce Bailey I don't like that
much but yeah those are my those are my
top picks so anyway that's it for this
one as always subscribe for more go to
