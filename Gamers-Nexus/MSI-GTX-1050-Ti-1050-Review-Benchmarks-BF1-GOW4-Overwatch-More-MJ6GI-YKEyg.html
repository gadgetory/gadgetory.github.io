Nvidia's new GT x 1050 and GTX 1050 TI
video cards that were reviewing today
the rx 462 gigabyte model has had a
price drop $10 to $100 MSRP in response
to the $110 MSRP of a 1050 and the rx
470 is now dropped $10 to a 170 MSRP
it's still hard to find for the most
part below a 200 other than one or two
examples today we are reviewing the GTX
1050 and gtx 1050 TI video cards
comparing them in thermals in FPS
overclocking and power draw but before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by Roseville and Anu Cullinan
tempered glass PC case which currently
has a deal where you get a free 650 watt
power supply with the purchase of the
case on Newegg hit the link in the
description for more on that so for the
cards we're using we're using a GTX 1050
Ti from MSI it is a gaming ex model that
means got the Twin Frozr cooler on it as
priced above the $140 MSRP that the
Bayes 1050 Ti is listed at and by the
way there's no reference model for
either of these are just a IV partner
cards the 10:15 on Ti we used which is
dismantled here one of them anyway is a
an MSI card it is base clocks it's
pretty darn simple the cooler is really
not that impressive but it is $110 so it
fits that MSRP that Nvidia was going for
and that's what we use for our non TI
model let's recap the block diagram
before getting to the review content the
GTX 950 and 1050 Ti both operate on a GP
107 GPU with a 1050 Ti using AGP 107 -
400 a 1050 using a GP 107 - 200 this is
similar to the 1080 and 1070 which use a
GP 104 400 GP 104 200 chip respectively
the GP 107 400 GPU has an SM count of 6
totalling 768 CUDA cores at 128 per SM
that is the Pascal architecture other
than GP 100 and this is built on 2g pcs
as we saw on the GTX 1060 and down now
the result is 6 T pcs the GP 107 400 GPU
s 48 TM use again that's 8 TM use per SM
with 32 ROPS it's smaller sibling the
GTX 1015 aunty Aiko
1sm and cuts down to five total
simultaneous multiprocessors which means
we lose 128 CUDA cores 8 TM use texture
map units and we're also cut down on
memory capacity unrelated leaf from the
1050 Ti though both utilize a 128-bit
wide interface so we're on 2 gigabytes
of vram for 1050 there's one skew and 4
gigabytes 1 skew for the 1050 Ti the eye
size is pretty small on these which does
mean that there's less area to dissipate
heat but they're also generating a lot
less heat anyway the die size of the 107
400 GPU is 132 millimeters squared which
you'll see on this b-roll by the way and
the cards are powered by the PCIe slot
in most cases some cards do include an
extra power header though like a 1050 Ti
gaming X that we received but not all of
them do this anyway for more
architecture discussion hit the link in
the description below that's for the
website the written review which has a
lot more detail and you'll get here but
you'll get a pretty good amount here
that also includes the test methodology
for thermals for FPS for overclocking
all that stuff if you have a question
about what drivers were used how we
tested something how we tested the game
what settings were used hit the link
it's probably answered as for thermals
here's our look at GP temperatures with
delta T over ambient if you don't know
what that means we've done a video on it
it's basically just the temperature - an
active measurement of ambience we have
ii ii ambient subtracted from ii ii
diode temperature and that takes care of
any fluctuation in HVAC so the 1050 TI
is at 39.3 3 celsius delta t / ambient
with a 5.4 9c idle that of course is
influenced more by the Twin Frozr cooler
than anything and the 1050 OC card is at
30 5.41 Celsius and it is a pretty bad
cooler just on the face of things when
you look at it but the GPU generates low
enough heat and requires low enough
power anyway that it seems to not really
matter a whole lot at the end of the day
Rx for 16 I chose on here 51 Celsius but
it is a sapphire cards half hour cooler
so again that's the most responsible
element and it's a bit hotter chip
anyway
moving on to power consumption measured
at the wall we're looking at total
system power of our test bench to create
a hierarchy between the cards the system
remains unchanged for every test so we
can look at Delta's between cards the
GTX 1050 based model with the
fleet system mind you is running at
about 72 volts amps idle below what our
750ti
SC was pulling and at about the same
load consumption the rh for 64 gigabyte
model is at about 170 volt amps just
under the 1050 TI gaming x is 177 volt
amps
load power consumption and that puts the
cards right around where they are
respect for in terms of power supplies
you could actually if you wanted to get
away with a 300 watt power supply with
these things because this is again an x
99 system with a lot of ram and iron
parts and we're still pulling just 177
volts amps at the high end between the
three cards i just listed let's get into
the gaming benchmarks for these cards
we're starting with overwatch at 1080p
given the obvious market position of 100
$250 devices we've only tested low-end
devices with overwatch and the rest of
the cards will appear on the next tests
against the last generations gtx 950 the
gtx 10:59 Ti is operating about 10 FPS
faster or about 10% change laws have
also improved on the GP 107 GPUs both
posting north at 70 FPS at the low end
though that argument is a little muted
since the lows are north of 60 on the
950 anyway
overwatch isn't an intensive game at the
end of the day so that's all there
really is to say about these results
large for 64 gigabyte is running at
about 67 FPS average with the 2 gigabyte
stock clocked card for $100 at 64 FPS
average just for the curious here's a
quick data point with the RX for 64
gigabyte vs. the gtx 1050 TI for
gigabyte up 1440p overwatch allows
render upscaling without a higher
resolution monitors so if you preferred
pixel density to speed you could
actually get away with a 1050 TI upscale
to 1440p anyway let's move on to a game
where we've got more cards on the bench
like the arts 417 480 and 1060 in
battlefield 1 our testing is defined
with exceptional depth in our be f1 GP
benchmark article if you're curious
about the precise actual process for
test execution you can check that out
here's B f1 at 1080p with dx11 and ultra
settings the gtx 750ti from the first
iteration of maxwell is operating at 32
FPS average and that's not exactly
playable you have to run low settings
for that combination to work and
battlefield 1 looks so good that it
really
is actually feel like a ways to do so
moving up the ranks we hit the rs4 64
gigabyte card at 43 FPS average then the
1050 at 46 FPS average which is mostly
the same though a couple percentage
points better technically and the gz x
1050 TI operates at 58 FPS average which
would actually make it reasonably
playable in competitive matches if
you're willing to reduce a few settings
to hide from ultra that performance puts
the 1050 TI about on par with the
overclocked to 960 SSC and considering
the 960 was $200 when it launched the
1050 TI is availability in the 140 to
165 range shows minimally progression in
the performance per dollar market and
these are x4 70 outperforms the 1050 TI
handily operating close to 75 FPS
average and with it low as time to close
to 60 FPS if the rx 470 is ever properly
available for 170 which there is one
card out there for 170 it would be a
serious competitor to the 165 MSI 1050
TI card for this game at least it would
be a better choice we'll talk about that
more in the conclusion as for dx12
performance you've already talked about
how high frame time variants of Mars the
game's low-end performance for both
Nvidia and and the hardware that remains
true here alongside the negative scaling
we observed in our original bf1
benchmark 1050 Ti is operating at 50 FPS
average width D X 12 and with 0.1% lows
that dip as hard as 1 to 2 fps and 1%
low is around 7 to 9 fps these issues
don't persist throughout the entire
multiplayer match if you play them but
you'll see hitching at least a few times
per match and that's enough to be
annoying we tend to see these every few
minutes it's just enough generally to
recommend focusing on dx11 results for
now regardless the stack up is pretty
similar here the RX for 64 gigabyte is
between the 1050 TI and 1050 and
performance moving on to 1080p with GTA
5 we see that the gtx 1050 TI is
operating at 67 FPS average with 1% and
0.1% low metrics that are reasonably
scaled leading the r9 380 X marginally
the 970 SSC is ahead of the 1050 Ti with
an 89 FPS average and the 1060 is above
all of these the 1050 Ti leads the rx
for 64 gigabyte card by about 20 fps
with the GTX 1050 non ti also ahead of
the RX 460 at 57 FPS the new at 10:50 is
marginally ahead of the Maxwell 950 but
they're pretty close to the same
here's Gears of War 4 at 1080p with high
settings we're seeing performance that
ranks the GTX 1050 Ti at around 72 FPS
average landing it again just under the
gtx 960 SSC from EVGA this also marks
the card well ahead of the GTX 950 and
the rx for 64 gigabyte card which pushes
52 FPS average the 10:15 on TI card also
pulls ahead of the rx 462 gigabyte model
and that's more significant in the 1%
and 0.1% low values thanks to better
frame times on the 1050 and it also
manages a better average than the 4
gigabyte rx 460 card bike ops 3 has some
performance limitations that prohibit 2
gigabyte cards from running equally high
settings to 4 gigabyte cards and up and
so this first set of data is only
showing the 4 gigabyte devices that
would be the RX 4 64 gigabyte and 1050
Ti no 1050 or 2gig 460 we're seeing 1050
Ti operating at about 78 FPS average
with the rx 460 getting closer to the
1050 TI's performance than most other
games the 1050 Ti is outperformed by the
r9 380 X in the scenario and the GTX 970
and 1064 in way outperform any of the
most recent releases in terms of video
cards in the last month or so Andy does
tend to be shown a bit of favor in black
ops 3 for testing but it's still not
enough to pull ahead of the 1050 Ti for
the rx 460 that said the RX 470 is well
ahead at 116 FPS average here's a quick
look at the 1050 and rx 462 gigabyte
cards at medium-high settings we are
forced to buy the game to dropped extra
quality on these devices so they have
their own smaller set of data for dota 2
Metro Mordor doom and more hit the link
in the description below and you'll find
those benchmarks here's a look at our
overclock stepping table for the GTX
1050 Ti note that we ended up capped on
our memory overclocking even setting the
OC to a thousand mega Hertz didn't
increase the base memory clock rate
beyond 2002 megahertz and that's about a
250 megahertz offset from base on the
memory we were also able to accompany
this with a 1911 megahertz peak core
clock or
about 1873 resting core clogs that's
more of an average the performance for
the 1050 Ti improved a little bit with
GTA 5 now operating at 68 FPS average
and with a for fps again 20.1% low is
not really significant or visible but
certainly an improvement shadow of
mordor moves to 59 FPS from 55 and is
one of the more clock sensitive games
which is why you're seeing that for FPS
jaunt we also see Mirror's Edge catalyst
shifting from 52 FPS average without the
OC to 55 FPS average with GOC not a big
deal overall but then again overclocking
doesn't seem to move framerate a whole
lot for most games with this generation
of hardware
anyway the 1050 Ti and the 1050 cater to
slightly different markets you've got
$110 MSRP card with obviously a range
above it for AIB partner models $140
MSRP card this one in this particular
case $165 so it does scale quite a bit
over the MSRP the two cards are
separated really only by a few things in
the architecture it's one SM difference
so you've got one SM effectively
disabled on the 10:59 ti that means 128
fewer cuda cores it means 8v or TM use
that's just every SM on this
architecture other than GP 100 will act
that way other than this the obvious
difference is the memory so 2 gigabytes
last vram on the 1050 and there's only
one SKU for it so we end up with a
performance stack that's pretty
straightforward at the top if you top
out at $170 which is around where this
is the RX 470 comes in and all the games
we are showing for the most part are h4
70 is a better performer than a 1050 TI
even the $165 model so that would kind
of get the the the favorable
recommendation over $165 1050 TI for the
most part unless you have a specific use
case once you get below that once you're
in 150 ish dollar range the cards that
are closer to MSRP for the 1050 TI are
actually pretty good and if you can't
afford that extra stretch to something
like an rx 470 it makes sense to buy
let's start with focus in on the 1050 Ti
and its alternatives there's one rx 470
available for the new MSRP and XFX model
and that's 170 dead the GTX 1050 T I
should have launched date cards for 140
with priyo si cards again scaling
upwards of 170 given the current
performance metrics we're seeing it
makes more sense for gamers to
prioritize an Rx for 70 at the 170 price
point than 1050 TI but that doesn't mean
the 1050 t I shouldn't be bought cards
closer to the $140 mark have a big
enough gap to make a difference in
budget builds and will cater to the same
market segment that the old 750ti once
did that extra $30 helps go toward a cpu
and at this price range that could be a
big deal we're talking the difference
potentially between an i3 and an i-5 but
if you're looking at the segment closer
to 170 rather than 140 150 we would
recommend the arcs 470 generally for
most different use cases that is until
you're reaching the gtx 960 3 gigabyte
and RX 40 4 gigabyte cards which we've
already got plenty of content on as for
the gtx 1050 this card is falling into
the range where we generally encourage
most gamers to take one step up to
something like a 1050 T I normally don't
recommend cards of this class for
something like overwatch and dota 2
though you'd be ok be in good shape with
1050 or even an Rx 460 but the GTX 1050
is vastly superior in each of these two
games and you can even upscale the
resolution to 150 percent off of 1080p
if desired with a GTX 950 and overwatch
so recap in generally in the 140 ish
wage the 1050 Ti makes good sense and if
you can stretch from a hundred and ten
dollar price point up to reach the low
end of the 1050 T is it's probably worth
it because that expands your range of
games from stuff like eSports titles no
no problem at all with just playing only
eastwards titles but if you have games
other than themes like csgo overwatch
dota2 and rocket League that you would
like to play it's worth looking into one
of these because you can get into things
like battlefield one with a bit of a
higher ceiling of your graphics quality
but if you are only playing to eSports
titles I suppose something like this
just bordering on unnecessary because
you've seen the frame rates for getting
already with a 1050 and even an rs4 60
now mentioning the rx 460 this card for
the most part does invalidate the 460 a
little bit it is even at a hard dollars
$10 reduced price from its MSRP this
thing's still outperforming a good bit
in some titles upwards of 20% and $10
difference to gain that much performance
does make this a better Buy but the RX
470 at the top
is a better buy than something like this
so it depends what you're going for this
is a bit of a tougher review because
we're obviously reviewing two cars of
different price ranges but you get the
idea all the numbers are there you can
