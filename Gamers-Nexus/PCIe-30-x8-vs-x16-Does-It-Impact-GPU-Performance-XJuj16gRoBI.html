this was just a curiosity on my part but
it's a question we ask pretty much every
generation of either PCIe or video card
architecture and that is what is the
impact of PCIe lanes on video card
performance so in this case we're
specifically looking at this GTA X 1080
just because the fastest performing
single card we have right now and we put
this into an X 8 slot PCIe gen3 and an X
16 slot PCIe gen3 the way to do this
this test is actually very easy to setup
so first of all the board we used is one
of these X 99 classified boards and it's
actually all these are hardwired for 16
if you look into the actual slot you'll
see that they are wired for 16 lanes but
they don't all actually produce 16 lanes
worth of performance on these cards and
so EVGA has a manual for this board that
does say specifically which slots to use
for your video card configuration I use
the ones you're not supposed to because
we were trying to see how does x8
perform so that's how we set it up you
can go into BIOS as well and validate
these settings so in BIOS and the top
slot on this particular board it will
push electrically 16 lanes and it tells
you that in BIOS if we move down to the
second slot which you really don't want
to use for any reason other than
something like an ancillary device like
PCIe SSD if you move to that slot you'll
see that it does push 8 lanes not 16 and
that's easy to validate through BIOS and
through software in Windows and things
like that so that's the setup the reason
you would run by 8 lanes I'm not too
sure maybe you're putting one of these
into a z97 or z170 board or something
older ish that is more lane limited than
x99 but that would really be the only
use case it's still worth testing though
always curious about the impact of it
and it does give us some Future Sight 2
PCIe Gen 4 and things like that so let's
just jump into the results this one's
pretty easy and straightforward first of
all Metro last light at 1440
key with very high and high settings and
tessellation the PCIe gen3 by 16 lane
assignment pushed 96 average 74 1% lows
and 70 0.3 0.1 percent lows compared
against the by 8 assignments 95 73.3 and
67 so the difference between the
averages is 1.0 5% negligible but
measurable and the difference between
the 1% lows is 0.95% so basically there
is a 1% difference in this game between
an eight-lane assignment PCIe gen3 and a
16 lane assignment for this particular
game before moving on further that would
mean really you have nothing to worry
about if you're concerned over whether
to put your high end GPU into a 16 or 8
Lane slot if you're choking on lanes
somewhere else like SSDs which really
should be pulling from the chip side
anyway but you get the idea if that is a
concern don't worry about it because
it's 1% difference but let's move on the
next game the next game is Mordor shadow
of Mordor and at 14:40 we're seeing 108
average versus 107 average with 8 lanes
half the lanes you lose 1 FPS and then a
60 point 7 for both 1 percent lows and a
very slightly reduced 0.1 percent load
metrics so the average difference
average FPS difference between 16 and 8
lanes is 0.93 percent again about 1
percent total between the two and that's
consistent with Metro last light at 4k
for shadow of Mordor we see about the
same thing the average FPS gap is 0.7
between sex 16 is 64 X a to 62 point 3
and that's a 1.1 percent difference so
negligible measurable but not something
you'd ever perceive as user black ops 3
1440p we see the same average FPS we see
a two point four six percent difference
in 1% lows and we see the same more or
less 0.1% lows and moving on to 4k it's
a gap of x16 at 71 point 3 X eights at
70 point seven and that is a 0.85
percent difference between the averages
again around 1
percent and the 1% Lowe's shows a 1.0 5
percent gap with the 57 point 3 vs. 56.7
moving on to GTA 5 at 4k with very high
and ultra settings effectively maxed out
with going without going to advanced
graphics the by 16 setup it's fifty
eight point three by eight is 58 FPS
average and one percent lows are forty
four point seven versus forty five point
three and that gives us a difference of
zero point five two percent between the
averages and one point three three
percent between the one percent mometrix
ashes of singularities on screen now but
you'll see that it's basically the same
thing this was just a short with dx12
but again performance is effectively
equivalent so even with a high end GPU
the the best performing single GPU we
currently have we're not seeing a
difference between sixteen lanes and
eight lanes maybe if we add something
like that r9 390 devil dual GPU single
card setup maybe then we would see a
difference I don't have one of those on
hand but we'll try and figure something
like that out as far as a single GPU
setup meaning one card one GPU there is
effectively no difference 1% difference
between 16 lanes and eight lanes and
that's really all there is to it if
you're doing SLI or something obviously
that's a bit different because the way
scaling works the way the bridge works
we'll look at that separately but for
now don't worry about the difference
between X 8 and X 16
when you're pairing up your GPU with
motherboard especially if you're using a
lower end card than one of these which
is supposed to be 720 dollars but if you
buy it today it's 1100 and is a terrible
deal so unless you're using that what is
effectively an $1,100 video card right
now
despite the MSRP well actually even then
you have nothing to worry about so
that's all for this test it's the same
it's the way it's been for the past few
generations I would imagine the
interface which is PCIe will continue to
push the bandwidth beyond what these
GPUs can actually really utilize in a
sense that chokes the performance in
games noticeably it's been that way for
ten years or more now and it will
probably continue to be that way for
some time so as always patreon link post
roll video if you liked this random
exploration of a curiosity we'll have
more content for you as always coming up
shortly this week thanks for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
