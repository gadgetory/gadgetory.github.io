and we were gonna talk with Chris from
robot entertainment about Orcs Must Die
Chris can you tell us what your
inspiration was for such an outrageous
game inspiration well yeah it really was
just a bunch of guys in the studio kind
of sitting around coming up with
different ideas for games
we've been playing kind of horde mode
games and also some tower defense games
we thought what would it be like to try
and throw those ideas together so we
broke up a couple guys did a prototype
and started to feel good and we decided
to move forward with it awesome
are there any other enemies other than
orcs oh yeah we've got a ton and they
all behave differently which is really
cool which kind of helps set the stage
for how you do your defenses and how you
plan things out but in the demo we're
showing the orcs we're showing ogres
which are big kind of burly tank guys
we're showing small runners on the
ground we just want to get to the rift
as fast as they can hard to target
fliers are in the air so there's a good
variety of them how many different trap
types are there our game the way it's
set up we have over 20 levels in it and
that's the main campaign of the game
when you finish a level you're given a
new trapping spell so over 20 that's the
long way of saying over 20
so we saw the archer in the first demo
yeah what other character types are
there if any before that you get to
place down yeah we're not really talking
about the other specific ones right now
but there are going to be other ones
that are pretty cool and it is a
multiplayer no single-player only so our
thinking behind that was because we're
such a small crew we wanted to do we
wanted to make sure we got in everything
nice and tight and polished it's really
rich when you get a chance to play it
there's a lot of detail going on in
there
I'm gonna get it out start seeing what
people like when they're interested and
kind of build off of it from there how
long has the game been in development so
far only seven months yeah and we're
shooting to get the game out in early an
early summer so it's a pretty quick
turnaround for us what what would you
say you personally are looking forward
to most about this game yeah well having
people play it the last two days it's
been really cool watching how people
have the different traps interact
because their people are doing things
that we would have never expected
they've got there they're throwing bombs
off of their flip traps all the way
across levels and it's landing on overs
heads and blowing up you know we're
seeing really really cool combinations
ah you know what would be great is if we
get to a point where people are throwing
these up on YouTube and now I'm kind of
that would be awesome
what for talking about the ways to kill
orcs and other enemies are there is it
pretty much make your own way to kill
them or their others set like
contraptions you can build an aside from
the basic traps well in the world
there's a ton of different things to
mess with so and it just depends on the
level but the levels were showing here
there's handle ears that are hanging
down from the ceiling you can pick those
off and they'll come screaming down and
smashing the guys we've got these giant
logs with spikes on them that are above
staircases you shoot them
rolling down the stairs and flatten
everybody we've got ballista that you
can get in and start shooting guys in
the ballista so there's a lot of that
stuff too what made you guys pick orcs
for the enemies is it just because
they're kind of squishy and everyone
knows them yeah yeah it just seemed like
the right thing to do at the time you
know and now the deeper we get into it
the more we just really want to tear
them up and find unique ways what kind
of weapons does the player-character
have so he's got kind of standard
weapons like a kind of an energy
crossbow and a blade staff but also a
series of spells the two were showing my
gosh were showing that you were showing
here we've got a fireball that does a
big area area effect explosion knocks
out guys around but it also does an
alternate act where it lays a firewall
down we've got a wind staff which pushes
guys away but you can also grab enemies
with it and kind of walk them into traps
while you're holding and slice them up
so there's a good amount of spells to
what what kind of closing comments are
most important things do you have for
people watching you know it's it's a
it's a pretty cool game you know I want
people to get their hands on and give it
a shot because it's a really interesting
balance where people are finding they
get a chance to lay out a great strategy
and finding a lot of fun in that and
then like it's it's really cool when
you're down on the ground and the orcs
are coming through and the ogres are
coming through and you've got to think
on your feet and switch to a weapon
fighting with a weapon and then drop
down a new trap but that's a it's really
a lot of fun awesome
so you're saying midsummer release or
somewhere around there and early summer
early summer okay so once again Chris
from robot entertainment working on or
quest I expect it sometime around early
summer and we look forward to it thanks
Chris right on thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
