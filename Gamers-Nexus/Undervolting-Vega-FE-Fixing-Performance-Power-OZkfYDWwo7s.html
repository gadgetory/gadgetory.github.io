requests on our user-submitted to-do
list for this card and it yielded some
of the most interesting results and data
set this feature benchmark shows how we
can significantly reduce power
consumption on Vega while yielding
better performance from the FE card not
even the same just straight better
performance better power consumption and
better thermals before getting to that
this is brought to you by our patreon
backers at patreon.com slash gamers
Nexus who helped us in funding these at
user requested benchmarks you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and access tell us
that directly or if you prefer you can
grab our brand new shirt design which
has a link in the description below so
this benchmark was requested a lot for
Vega because in past and the card
generations like even the rx 500 Polaris
refresh it's been possible to undervolt
the cards or reduce the voltage going to
the core and achieve either the same or
slightly better performance in terms of
clock stability while also potentially
reducing power consumption as opposed to
for example a straight plus 50% off set
without under voltage in which scenario
end up destroying a lot more power
stabilizing the frequency but it's at
the expense of extra power and extra
heat because extra power so that's why
this was interesting to people and it
was interesting to us as well hence
running the test but a few things here
just to get everyone on the same playing
field power target and voltage are sort
of tied at the hip but they're really
not the same thing so you can increase
power target and decrease voltage and
they're not really going to conflict
with each other what's happening is
these two different items power target
limits how much power is permitted to go
to the GPU so that might be something
like 20 to 21 amps and the stock state
for example and then of course you have
thermal targets as well like 80 or 85 C
which will limit you thermally so you
have two different variables there where
you can be constrained thermally or
constrained and power consumption or
power availability to the card so if you
increase the fan rpm on this to
something crazy like 100% you eliminate
that thermal restraint but you now are
facing a power constraint so that's
that's part one part two
voltage is what's applied to the core in
this case technically you can change the
memory voltage as well we're just
looking at core voltage today more
voltage means more power consumption so
that is problematic potentially if one
you just don't want to draw as much
power with really no need and two it
means more heat so in the stock state
we're actually allowing less power to go
to the core because you're at a zero
offset so you're 100% power target or
hundred percent power consumption as
opposed to 150 for example so you're
allowing less power to go to the core
and you're running in this instance a
higher voltage than is necessary and the
cards have DPM States so they go I think
it starts at zero but they go up through
seven and the seventh state is basically
the highest boost possible so out of box
for this that's 1600 megahertz and out
of box the voltage is 1200 millivolts so
1.2 volts the next state down is 1528
megahertz and the voltage is a bit
changed as well and then below that you
start getting into the territory of 1440
megahertz so in the initial reviews when
you saw people saying that the card
wasn't sustaining 1600 megahertz it was
probably 1440 to 1528 because those are
the two options in the pre-configured
DPM States in a.m. these drivers and
BIOS for the vega card and the result is
that you end up with lower performance
because the clock is throttling down to
those two states and again it's only one
or two reasons for this it's either the
power or the thermals so under volting
is a way to solve some of that and
that's what we're getting into today so
targeting methods and problems first in
case you want to do this you should be
aware of these things
first of all problems what man is not
perfect it has a lot of bugs
some people have not run into the same
ones that we are but that's because
they're doing things differently if for
example you go in for the overclocking
and voltage tools and you set them all
to the same number so sixteen hundred
one through seven and twelve hundred one
through seven then we have seen
especially with other changes in there
like fan speeds issues where HBM drops
to 500 mega
and that will really hurt your
performance so be aware of that
basically I don't know the exact answer
as to when HBM 2 drops to 500 megahertz
it just seems to kind of happen as
you're tweaking stuff in there and I'm
not sure which change causes it but just
be aware that it can happen so if you go
in with a plan to undervolt like this
just keep an eye on HBM speeds
after you're done to make sure you
haven't actually worsened performance
though your power consumption would
probably get better so that's one thing
to be aware of what tool recommended to
me by build Zoid is pretty good but has
a lot of problems as well it has the
same 500 megahertz memory bug and it
seems to be caused by the same things
but what tool is pretty easy to work
with if you prefer that and then finally
the fan targets are wrong so you can go
in and set a fan target in watt man or
watt tool of say 3400 rpm and it'll add
a couple hundred rpm on top of that so
it'll go up to like 3700 for example
close enough though close enough to use
but just something to be aware of and
then finally for our testing we have
three configurations to look at
primarily one is stock Vega so 0 changes
at all after a driver install the second
one is stock Vega with a plus 50% power
target and a fixed fan speed 3400 rpm in
Hua Man which is like 3700 in reality so
the important part plus 50% on the power
and then the last one is stock Vega in
this configuration plus 50% power under
vaulted to whatever was the most stable
and with the fan speed also at 3400 so
stock with plus 50% and stock with plus
50 percent under volted are going to be
directly comparable thermally whereas
the stock one will not be because it
regulates its own RPM and so will be
different so that's the setting we're
using this will allow us to ensure that
we're not hitting the power lot wall
ensure we're not hitting a thermal wall
and leave us with an understanding of
how much voltage is required to remain
stable for our voltages we tried a lot
of them 1080 just wasn't going to
cut it 10 80 millivolts not good enough
we then tried 1090 millivolts down from
1200 mind you and 1090 was stable in a
lot of the titles it was stable and
firestrike basically ad infinitum it was
not stable in for honor
so for honor we had to actually go up to
as high as 11 20 millivolts and then
some other games required 1100 or 1090
so it's not perfect basically again if
you're planning to do this be aware of
that you will either have to take the
highest stable voltage like 1120 for
example in our case for all titles or
you'll have to get used to the idea of
changing voltage for each application or
setting profiles I suppose you can do as
well so be aware of all that but we can
get into the charts now start with
current draw at the PCIe cables only not
counting the PCIe slots the completely
stock card starts off drawing about 268
watts but as we approach the 400 second
mark the card starts spiking hard
between 17.7 amps and twenty three amps
this behavior correlates with clock
throttling which we'll show in a moment
and is precisely why we've been saying
that Vega Fe air can't hold its
advertised 1600 megahertz boost clock
out of the box its power limit and
cooler are simply insufficient the
cooler can do it if exiting the fan
profile and going to high DPS with your
own fan profile but this is where it
sits out of box that gives us our
baseline the next move is to get the
frequency to hit 1600 megahertz
constantly so we increase the power
target by 50% and set a fixed fan speed
and solve for the thermal limit
absolving Vega of both of its main
limitations anyway at once the red line
is the result a new problem emerges the
normals in frequency are now under
control but the PCIe cable from the
power supply is putting out 30 amps at
the time averaging about 28 to 29 amps
overall that's about 344 to 370 Watts
down the PCIe cables and it's going to
start generating more heat in the card
as a result but it's also just kind of
wasteful power consumption finally our
under voltage line emerges the blue line
represents an under volt of negative 110
millivolts so we've dropped from 1200 to
1090 millivolts current is now 23 amps
for power consumption
283 watch at the PCIe tables that's
about 15 watts more than the stock set
up that struggled to maintain 1600
megahertz about 87 watts lower than the
power offset setup that sustained 1600 I
guards successfully and should lower
thermals as well let's go to that chart
our orange line again represents the
stock auto configuration which runs a
fan curve that isn't aggressive enough a
voltage that's too high and a power
budget that's too low the worst of
everything the result is constantly
hitting the thermal limit and
potentially throught well definitely
throttling observed at the 85 C mark
though there are a few spikes to 90 C it
tends to stick at 85 applying a 50%
power offset and fixing the frequency to
1600 megahertz properly temperatures are
about 73 Celsius now but the fan is 70%
to control for the thermal variable for
under bolting so noise levels are
somewhat unbearable at 60 DB a versus
the auto noise level of roughly 50 DBA
but there's room to drop the fan speed
with a lower voltage because less heat
is generated as less power is consumed
we just stuck with these numbers because
we really wanted to make sure there was
no thermal limitations that would mess
up our undervolt in tests the more
appropriate comparison would be our blue
line versus our red line has these two
are tested with the same settings aside
from just one variable voltage to the
core the fan speeds the same the 50%
power offset is the same and the voltage
is the only difference at a 110
millivolt reduction on the under voltage
card where we perform at 53 to 66
Celsius for about a 7 to 10 Celsius
reduction from the card operating at
1200 millivolts that's pretty good so
far the last question is a frequency
plot in frequency the orange line that
shows the stock out of box configuration
for the Vega frontier - an air-cooled
card
we're throttling hard and only rarely
achieving 1600 megahertz the regularity
of which 1600 megahertz is achieved
diminishes significantly as time goes on
largely due to thermal constraints in a
default fan curve we tend to be
operating at DPM power state 5 to 6
rather than state 7 which would give us
full performance the red and blue lines
converge on this chart as increasing the
power target and removing the thermal
limit gives us a perfectly flat 1600
megahertz curve closer to what
advertised on the box that said the red
line is polling
344 to 370 watts to the PCIe cable so
it's a little aggressive and may not be
worth the power and thermal load
overstock under volting however permits
1600 megahertz to remain possible 50
percent power offset possible and thus
permitting 1600 megahertz and still
draws 87 watts less powers on the
redline with only 15 watts more than the
orange line that's pretty good trade so
that proves the theory and shows that
under bolting is working at least once
you learn how to deal with the
applications and their bugs and it looks
good so far now obviously a maintain
1600 megahertz or sustained versus 1442
1528 fluctuating is going to perform
better but just to really drive at home
we're going to perform a few benchmarks
on 3dmark
ghost recon and doom and a couple extras
will be in the article linked below but
the point isn't to re benchmark the
entire test suite we're just going to
give you a worst-case a best-case and
then a synthetic test so that there's a
pretty wide spread of what under Bolton
does in the real world now additionally
we are leaving out spec view perf again
not fluidly the point of this if you
want spec you perf performance numbers
check our hybrid Vega card video with
the results as that has the very top end
of spec you perf performance once this
thing is overclocked as far as we could
get this particular card fire strike
ultra starts us out the Vega Fe err card
when completely stock ran a graphics
core of 4906 with our 50% power offset
cards both operating at around 50 to 70
graphics core this includes the
under-voltage card which manages about a
nine to ten percent performance uplift
over the stock card here's the crazy
thing
again we're not overclocking to achieve
this all we're doing is making more
power available while reducing the
voltage which Nets a marginal power
consumption spike at the trade of more
consistent and faster frame time that's
a pretty good trade for 15 watts and as
far better than the 87 watts of the
power offset without under bolting card
that we did for point of reference our
hybrid EFI overclocked performed at 57
74 which is 7% faster than the under
voltage card kind of puts into
perspective just how far are under
bolting and over
and we'll get you to begin with fine spy
gives us a gain of about seven point six
percent from the under-voltage card over
the stock card with our hybrid OC
gaining another nine point six percent
on top of that
additionally the drawing significantly
more power at around thirty three apps
we have a few more fire strike charts in
the article link in the description
below those interest you has four games
some experienced instability at 1090
millivolts and had to be moved up to
1104 honor was particularly unstable and
required a core voltage of about 11 20
millivolts so these aren't perfect and
can't all sustained at 1090 but we've
got to spread and overall you're looking
at better performance versus stock
anyway let's look at Ghost Recon first
at 4k and with very high settings the
under-voltage AMD Vega
err card performed at 41 FPS average
with lows close by at 37 and 36 the
stock card with no modifications
whatsoever operated at 37.7 FPS average
resulting in a performance uplift of
8.8% from the stock card this uplift is
because the stock card cannot maintain
1600 megahertz without power offset but
again a power offset without
over-voltage increases your power
consumption by 80 to 90 watts thereby
increasing the thermals that the card
deals with this under Bolton and
overpowering appears to be the best
approach to extracting more performance
as we've done here with doom using
Vulcan async compute which is enabled
without anti-aliasing these days and
rendered at 4k the Vega under volted
card operates at 70 1.6 FPS average with
low-end frame times also improved over
the stock card our average FPS
improvement is about 11.5% in Doom
following the trend of Doom being a
somewhat best-case scenario for AMD on a
routine basis the performance table is
tremendous here when considering our
minimal power consumption increase and
better overall control of the card so
that should hopefully answer at least
most of the question of under-voltage on
Vega Fe thank you for the suggestion for
that one a few notes here for the end of
this first of all obviously this isn't a
perfect solution no matter what 10 90
millivolts is great but it doesn't work
everywhere so you've got to add
according to whatever the software
demands you have to add the power
consumption to account for that
difference separately at this point it's
really
kind of like buying a project car if
you're doing these kinds of
modifications hopefully it's because you
enjoy them because otherwise you're
dealing with buggy software that'll set
you back until you figure out it's weird
kinks and anomalies and most of those
just save you time seem to be if you set
D p.m. states 1 through 7 all to be the
same frequency and voltage which is not
an issue on the other cards but is on
this one because of some weird fury left
over code but once you pass that you
still have an issue of tweaking the
voltage to be a minimum voltage required
for stability for each application if
that's not appealing then you you're
either left with run at stock or run it
with the the highest lowest voltage
possible to sustain everything so below
stock but maybe something like 11 22 11
40 millivolts rather than 1200 that
point you're not really saving a whole
lot it's certainly better than 1200 when
it's not needed but it would it would
make sure that pretty much every
application works within another note
not all GPS are the same ours may
undervolt better or worse than others
including the ones that you buy so keep
that in mind too you probably don't just
copy the the numbers we got because it
might not work on yours now as for why
this is the case it's kind of it's weird
this is something that is somewhat
consistent with AMD GPUs lately where
you can undervolt them and improve
performance and at least one aspect and
as for why that would be the case my
assumption would be that this is
something where Andy is picking a
voltage that they know will work and
keep the card from crashing because
that's what happens if your voltage goes
too low on all of their silicon so it
might just be some kind of safe net of
we know 1200 will keep all these things
afloat in all applications so we're just
going to set it here whereas if you're
fine tuning the thing you have a lot
more room to play but no company is
going to do that so the other option is
they didn't have enough time to test it
and they pick the highest voltage that
they could set without being ridiculous
and knew that it would work and keep
things stable at which point it
more time and testing but not really
sure which is the the reason for the
higher voltage than necessary but either
way you have room if you buy either this
which probably no one in our audience
should buy or rx Vega which is more
likely to be a viable candidate for you
it's going to apply there too so you
have room with the Vega architecture and
cards to potentially undervolt
and improve performance now rx Vega is
not out yet well test it we'll see if we
can under bolt that one as well
and if they've set the same
conservatively high voltage curve volt
frequency curve on that card as this one
then there might be room for power
consumption reduction on rx maker but
all that is out in the future so stay
