last I left spoke with you at I think
commies axe about deleting Intel CPUs we
deal it a sudden 100x back then and now
after the deal it died mate has been out
and we've deleted several things you've
got a new direct eye contact kit so
what's let's let's go over the base for
the product and the name things like
that and I guess we'll talk they're all
differences too so what what what's the
let's start with a name oh yeah it's
very special it's called a sky like a
cleric die frame so I've been very
creative there yeah so so marketing
department in your budget or no such a
direct frame the point is to remove the
socket basically right yeah it replaces
the whole ILM essentially so you have to
remove that thing completely also the
back plate of the motherboard then
obviously you have to delete your CPU
you leave off the heat spreader put the
CPU back in put the back plate from the
back to the mainboard screw in the
direct iframe and that's basically it's
pretty simple and then the point being
that you can allow a direct contact
between the die and Coldplay what kind
of thermal benefit do you see from that
it really depends on the chip so it
depends if it's a hiker count local
Township depends if it's very convex or
not also depends on cooler thermal paste
everything if you take all of that into
account usually let's say two to ten
degrees difference that's the highest I
saw was in a 7 &amp;amp; 8 exe the one I
actually have here I for some reason
that the chip is very convex and if you
have a cooler that's also a little bit
convex it really well it works a lot
better than using the normal I HS and
that's like 8 to 10 degrees difference
also what I've seen is that the course
are getting a lot closer together so
normally there sometimes you have a
chord it's like 50 degree Celsius hotter
than other ones and if we use direct
either closer together so it reduces the
delta quartic or yeah and at that point
I guess for for these numbers you're
giving our is this with thermal paste
between the cold plate and the die yeah
I mean the previa the the first testing
I did was just deleting with liquid
metal and normal conventional compound
on top between the cooler and IHS and
the second testing with liquid metal on
top of this and between the cooler okay
and as for risks any risks involved
because typically if we've had people
ask us to do direct eye tests and the
answer generally has been no because
without a frame you risk cracking the
die or something so is there a torque
spec for tightening the cooler or what
are the risks yeah that was one of the
biggest challenges I mean mainly having
an even pressure on all the PCBs to push
them down into the socket equally
because if you would have too much
pressure on the top PCB the bottom one
is really thin it would kind of not
really Bend but you just lose socket
contact you lose memory channels PCI
Express devices are gone and that was
one of the challenges and then as you
said before it's kind of an risk
cracking the dive if you just mount it
on top but so the tolerance is really
tight on this on all the dimensions
especially the the bottom ones that
touch the PCB but the very thin part on
top it's like zero point five to two
zero point five eight millimeters and
it's it's like not even 0.1 millimeter
high difference to the core so no matter
what you do if you have it mounted you
can do whatever you want with your
cooler you're not gonna crack to die and
what about pricing and availability
availability will be quite decent I
think we have a lot of well several
hundred pieces that say that it will be
available firstly through caseking and
OC UK later on over ms on us as well and
pricing will be 59 or 69 US dollar not
sure about that yet but roughly that
have a release date next week or
whenever this video is online so for
more information links in the
description below we will have one of
these two tests so we can do some direct
eye cooling test versus our original
deal id's and thank you as always for
joining me thank you mint we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
