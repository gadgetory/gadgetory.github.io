GN episode as always that leave your
questions in the comment section below
for next episode or if you're a patreon
backer you can leave them in the page
around discord we also have a second
extra patron to ask GN video that'll go
up separately from this and will be
available only to patreon backers so if
you're interested in that one go to
patreon.com/scishow gamers Nexus to get
it otherwise we've got the full-length
normal episode here so before that this
video is brought to you by EVGA and the
X 299 dark motherboard for the Intel
high end desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is
one of the only motherboards on the
market with proper vrm cooling we've
tested this and found a significant
performance increase over those without
active cooling on the BRMS this board
was used in our recent attempts to set a
top-10 record in fire strike and you can
learn more about the x-29 dark at the
link in the description below so prior
to the questions this thing this is the
CPU or AP that we got in from AMD from
part of that boot kit that we reviewed
and if anyone was curious I haven't sent
it back yet obviously I got an email
reminder from the warranty program was
all automated that just said you need to
send this back within 15 days otherwise
you're not gonna be able to use the
service again so I mean I'll send it
back I have really no reason to keep it
but I was curious about what would
happen if anyone was curious that's what
happens they basically say you can't use
it again so it doesn't look like I would
be charged for it or anything like that
but anyway that's going back soon first
real question is an interesting one that
I've been talking with about with AIB
partners about lately this is from David
Watson who said hey Steve do you think
we will end up seeing and Vidia
competing with aftermarket cards more
directly by releasing their own non
founders edition cards with new custom
coolant solutions and heat sinks with
double or triple fan designs I think
it's fascinating prospect and when I
feel NVIDIA has had a lot of thought
bent on and it's really bound to you as
much sooner rather than later because if
they can get more market share they
surely will and I honestly feel it's
coming from Nvidia and could be massive
for them so do you feel this is on the
horizon I
I don't this like I said there's
something I've spoken with a lot of
people about because you look at what
what anybody has done and they've
introduced reference cards which both
vendors have had for a long time but
they have introduced reference cards
that are separately branded and also
more importantly sold directly by Nvidia
and he has done things kind of like this
but not quite the same so the best
example with AMD would probably be the
fury X where there were no partner
designs allowed it was only Andy's
design that was it but you still
ultimately bought the fury action say
fire or Asus or whomever so this is a
little bit different although not too
much but they're there but they're
different enough so Nvidia they have
their founders Edition cards that they
sell directly currently at a pretty good
price considering the market because
they've stuck to about MSRP and it's the
only other way to get on mice RP cards
is basically go to EVGA x' website or
any of the other manufacturers who have
a store and buy it from them because the
retailers aren't gonna help you out so
do I think it's on the horizon I don't
know I don't feel like this is something
we'll see anytime soon that said
certainly on videos in a good place
where if they wanted to make a better
cooler they can do it it's it's not
they make silicon products it's not that
much harder to make something with two
fans on it so it's not like there's a
technical hurdle there the only thing
that's stopping on video from making
better coolers on the cards is the fact
that they have partners who can do that
for them so why put the expense in
there's extra marketing like work that
EVGA and asus and all them can do for
you they can handle the entire warranty
process they can handle shipping and
distribution so there's a lot of
advantage to having partners handle all
of these things because it's all
logistics and SKU tracking and
management of inventory and management
of warranty and RMA and all this stuff
and Nvidia spends their money on R&amp;amp;D and
engineers for the most part and their
own marketing obviously geforce and all
that stuff is all marketed but there's
an advantage certainly to having
partners so it's not like they provide
no service
and their coolers are pretty good of
course but the coolers are probably the
weakest aspect of the entire argument
because like I said it's not that hard
for a company like Nvidia to make it
cooler like the ones that their board
partners make so yes I've spoken with
some board partners about the idea and
this is just kind of like casual
conversation in the past as something
that people are distantly maybe anxious
about
but I don't have any reason to believe
that this would happen anytime soon
that said Nvidia sometimes does almost
feel Apple like in some of their
marketing and in the way that the
company carries itself I'm not saying
that's a good or a bad thing but in
terms of building a product and having a
really clear distinction of like this is
the product by our company like apples
got the MacBook or whatever I don't even
know the process but they have their
product and that's it that's the end of
the line it's the start in the end of it
and they build this whole marketing hype
around it and they control all the
messaging on it so there are advantages
to both approaches of having partners
and not Apple if you take that analogy
certainly has its own challenges like
with price but also the windows products
have a lot of their own challenges as
well so yeah I don't know I don't think
this is something that's on the horizon
any time soon but I guess the only
valuable information I can provide here
is that this is something that we've all
kind of talked about behind the scenes
and have wondered about but there's no
concrete evidence to suggest that Nvidia
would compete with his Ford partners
directly at this time in fact when the
founders edition cards launched and they
got a lot of flack for this but when
they launched the founders edition cards
were I think $50 more than than actual
MSRP for the board partner cards and so
they were actually distant that they're
further away from competing with those
partners because their cards were more
expensive than the board partners in
most cases
so yeah no evidence to suggest that this
would happen anytime soon but it's been
thought about next question
thank Buddha says quick question
regarding the 200 FPS limit in newer
questionmark games is this applied per
monitor if you're asked if you're using
multi monitor or is actual a game that's
locked to 200 FPS total it's the game
for the most part so doom does this and
I think maybe destiny
I think destiny does as well so with
doom specifically I know what the cause
of that is doom limits to 200 FPS
because of a physics issue in fact the
doom T mid they batted for both teams
and video and AMT at different points in
the development cycle earlier on it was
Nvidia Nvidia brought the doom team out
to a press event I think for the GTX
1080 and they showed the game and noted
that it was capped at 200 FPS because of
a physics bug that the team was working
on resolving hopefully before the launch
of the GTX 1080
obviously that never happened it never
got fixed they came out later to some
a.m. the event I want to say was the
Polaris 1 the same bug existed there was
no further conversation about it so the
limit your scene typically if it's not
because it's a console port that's been
poorly done or something if there's
actually just a kind of random high FPS
limit it's often physics Skyrim and
Elder Scrolls games and fallout or great
examples of this as well there's a 60
FPS you can unlock the FPS and if you
put it not powerful enough set of
hardware and lower the settings enough
and really blast your framerate
you can do pretty crazy things with
physics just just because the game bases
the physics calculations on the frame
rate so locking it to max 60 resolves
that but once you start pushing like 400
frames per second you can really break
the games so yeah that it's it's not it
is not to do with the monitors unless
it's a vsync thing if it's game engine
bound meaning you've turned off vsync
and you still have a cap then then it's
probably because of a game engine
limitation often the physics
if they do it based on frames next
question Michael Morgan says can you
demonstrate the end-user benefit of HP
MMS memory over gddr5 or g5x
on GPUs please so we've got we've talked
about this first let me refer you to a
previous video of ours that was about
how much HBM costs this was specifically
a video talking about the cost to
manufacture Vega products and the HP M
was a large aspect of that so in that
video we make the point of why Andy
chose HP M how they restored more or
less required to use it for that
particular product because although it
would have been cheaper with gddr5 or 5x
even it it would not compete as well it
wouldn't it wouldn't compete so HP m has
got a lot of advantages to it one of
them is power consumption and I have all
the specific numbers in that video I
don't actually have them in my head
anymore we filmed that while ago but
power consumptions much lower with HP m
per gigabyte in an ideal world where HBM
cost is something we don't have to think
about you would use HP m on basically
everything because the power consumption
is lower so from strictly a standpoint
of being energy efficient which helps
elsewhere like in thermals or just I
mean there's no reason to waste power in
being energy efficient HP M is superior
especially for the performance you gots
a bit more complicated than that
with AMD specifically the Vega products
and the fury previously were already
such high power consumption that
requiring that much more for gddr5 is
starting to become a problem in terms of
your power requirements for the whole
board all of it not just the GPU and
then also further depending on the type
of memory you're using with the GPU and
the GPU architecture it's possible to
become memory bound and this happens
with it's actually we have to answer
your question can you demonstrate we
have demonstrated it with the AM D
products again because they primarily
are the ones that use HP m with a nd
products we've shown that
increasing the HBM clock overclocking
HBM rather than just a core clock in
fact in fact to you down clock the core
overclocking HBM will generally
typically up to a point of diminishing
returns get you greater gains and
performance than the core and that would
be the beginnings of indicating that
there is a memory limitation it's not
all there but in the other test we've
published and we did a lot when Vega
launched you can more or less draw the
conclusion that it typically becomes
bound by memory before anything else so
in this instance because h BM is
advantaged although they have fewer
stacks of HB m on Vega they they want
with two stacks instead of four so you
are still running a thinner bus than on
Fiji with Fiji you had four stacks so I
think it was a 4096 bit bus but it was
HP m1 so fewer bits per pin so you end
up with I think it's two stacks on Vega
with HB m 2 so it's a thinner bus 2048
or something but it makes up for it in
the frequency of the memory which is
much higher it's like 945 instead of 500
all these numbers off the top of my head
I think they're pretty accurate though
so yeah the the answer though is HB m is
basically a requirement on GPUs that
become memory limited or GPUs that have
serious power consumption issues already
where you can't afford another 30 40 50
watts for GE or 5 especially at the
capacities that HB m can do in the same
space for the power that it takes and we
do have a lot of great content on that
so just search the channel for HB m or
for Vega and find some of the stuff we
posted when it launched I think we also
did some HP I'm testing on the Titan V
where we same thing overclock HP M
versus core what happens so you can find
that content as well next question is
Vishal Baabda who says why do CPU what
why do CPUs not have different
manufacturers like GPUs
there are more manufacturers we might
get more enthusiast features from the
factory like liquid metal Tim and better
IHS so first of all ideally you use
solder not liquid metal liquid metal
coming out of the factory doesn't make a
lot of sense if they're going that
approach it makes more sense for them to
just solder it at that point so liquid
metals more of an enthusiast thing as
you've pointed out but it doesn't make a
lot of sense manufacturing it would once
they've gone that far
solder it's where you go it makes more
sense for the manufacturer better IHS
sure that's that's certainly possible
but yeah so the general answer here why
don't CPUs have different manufacturers
like GPUs consider the market I guess so
with with GPUs you've got nvidia and AMD
they make everything with CPS obviously
Intel and AMD make everything but GPUs
require a whole lot more than just the
the single part you don't just buy a GPU
from Nvidia or from AMD and then socket
it into a board like you buy a CPU and
you socket it into a motherboard so a
GPU is is fitted with enough special
requirements that it makes sense to have
those board partners you have different
sources who supply the memory you could
get it from at one point al-qaeda or
these days Samsung hynix micron for
example so someone needs to take control
of where the memory is coming from make
sense to put a manufacturer there they
pick the memory supplier they pick a PCB
supplier they design the PCB they design
the cooler they pick suppliers for the
cooling components so there are a lot of
suppliers that go into a single GPU or a
single video card I should say and I
suppose you can make the argument that
why don't companies like Intel just make
the motherboard because that would be
the equivalent it would be if they if
Nvidia and AMD made their own cards then
Intel would make their own motherboard
well an Intel did make their own
motherboards at one point it didn't go
too well they they had a lot of issues
controlling it and part of that I think
does come down to what I was saying
earlier with
Logistics and part tracking warranty all
of the supplier relations certainly a
company with a market cap of 150 billion
dollars or whatever it is these days
could make that stuff work but they
tried and they didn't do a great job of
it that until motherboards went under
they even had that whole better together
branding as well which AMD stride
similar types of branding but I I don't
have a great answer specifically why but
from industry experience if you kind of
look at the whole picture of things it
makes sense to me that with something
that's a socketable part like a cpu you
just make it you sell it direct cuz cut
out the middleman kind of like what we
were talking about with Nvidia why
doesn't that video cut out the middleman
well there a couple of reasons to keep
them around Intel tried to cut them out
with their own motherboards didn't go
over so I don't know I that's kind of
how I look at it Intel also if you kind
of look at how they're making the parts
and many an AMD don't fabricate their
own GPUs they go through partners Global
Foundries tsmc people like that Intel
owns their own fabs which is quite a bit
different because that's all in-house
and there's I mean they already don't
have middle people to make the thing so
I have middle people to brand it and put
a heatsink on it I guess because that's
really the only difference you have at
least with GPUs you have a couple more
things you can specialize so yeah I
don't know that's that's how I see that
guess next one we have a celebrity
question this is from Satoshi Nakamoto I
believe it's the real one we've we found
him he was on our discord I don't think
that surprises anybody Satoshi says of
course hey guys could you reach out to
Thermaltake and ask them if they have
any idea for the arrival of the level 20
case well mr. Nakamoto if I may if I may
call you that the level 20 case I
actually I sent this question the
Thermaltake not sure whether it was a
joke or not and apparently it's in high
demand a lot of you want to know
it's gonna be available there's not a
hard date yet they're pushing to get it
out keep your eyes on their social media
channels they're just finalizing all the
production and everything like that so
shouldn't be too long for anyone who who
doesn't know that's a $1,000 case so it
would make sense that the god of Bitcoin
I guess would want one next question
defenestration eyes throwing people out
of windows says Steve a massive limit
for AP use is there need to use system
memory do you think Abe use will remain
on the low end or end up high end is
there not actually limit to ddr4 ap use
more memory channels on AP use or will
more memory channels appear in the
future on AP use given how board
partners operate and push for chip
consolidation do you think we might see
a motherboard RAM GPU CPU as a single
PCB I think there's a couple questions
here so first one do I think ap use will
end up in the high end how do we define
high end if our definition of high end
is competing in graphics capabilities
with a 1080 Ti than know if our
definition of high end is competing with
what I would call mid-range maybe let's
say a 10 60 or an RX 580 or Vega 56
something kinda in the 200 $350 in an
ideal world price range I still don't
really think so not today not today but
ap use are cramming a lot of processing
power into a small space and he's done a
great job where they realized that these
are for gaming devices into outputs in
IGP and everything they make basically
they take less die space to put that IGP
in there then Andy does for their
graphics components because Intel is
probably under the assumption that
you're buying the i7s and coupling it
with a d GPU Andy took the other
approach of saying if you're buying
something that's 300 plus dollars then
screw it we won't include an integrated
graphics component we'll use all the
space for the
the CPU and then you can go buy your own
graphics card and deal with it yourself
and then they also make the assumption
that at the low end with ap use you
probably if you're spending one hundred
two hundred seventy dollars on it are
buying it for gaming and so if you're
buying it for gaming the GPU component
sort of matters the most
provided that you have enough frequency
and a couple of threads from the CPU so
with that provision I don't think that
Andy is going to be cramming like a Vega
56 equivalent into an APU anytime soon
look at how much space Vega takes 56
takes right the die size alone is a
concern you start eating more of the
shared die space or the shared substrate
for a bigger graphics component at some
point you run into limitations as we
advanced in the future it'll get that
direction I don't I don't think there
will ever be though in the immediate
like next couple years I don't think
there will be an APU that would go
properly high-end like 1080 plus in
modern day terms because although an APU
and maybe five years could do what a
1080 does today I don't think it's gonna
do what an AMD like Vega 76 or whatever
does at that point in the future
next question though but they are good
though the APS are good they do the the
things they're supposed to do but it's
not meant to be that kind of component
it's you're asked you're asking to cram
too much into one spot I think could
happen in the future though distantly
next part of your question was let's see
consolidation a single motherboard Ram
GPU CPU PCB it kind of exists to some
extent you can get basically PGA devices
you look at laptops that's more or less
what you're talking about take the Apple
example again Apple solder is it all on
to one board for the most part soldered
CPU it's all BGA ball grid array
soldered memory soldered flash
components in some cases it's all
soldered so I that's I guess kind of
what you're talking about at that point
it does exist
typically in really small form-factor
applications we're having modular
components doesn't make sense because of
the space requirement or the thermal
concern see next one so this one I need
to we'll come back to this more in the
future once I get around to the fans
housing content at some point we do the
basics now Thane of Starfall said I've
bit confused by case fans lately
specifically rpm and in relation to
voltage if I understand correctly
different fans have different max and
minimum rpm at a given voltage but what
happens when you connect two fans with
different rpms to a single header on the
motherboard using a Wye splitter so yes
you do understand correctly if I take 10
Noctua nfa fourteens which we've
actually done and plug them into the
same motherboard header and spin them up
to max 100% versus whatever the minimum
voltage is you'll see different rpms and
that's manufacturing tolerances as for I
think part of this question was about
fire I've read on forums that the cable
or port can catch fire if they draw too
much power is this true it's always
possible make a fire with electronics
but it shouldn't really happen so what
you're asking basically the the fan
headers on motherboards are typically
rated for one amp and the high amperage
or H am P is typically what it's labeled
high amperage headers on motherboards
are often rated for two amps not always
check your motherboard manual but if you
put a Y splitter into a 2 amp header
you're probably gonna be fine and you
plug litter into a 1 amp header and then
you plug a bunch of fans into it and run
them at max speeds you might have
problems theoretically shouldn't start a
fire but but yeah it comes on to the to
how much current the header can handle
it's one or two amps typically so just
be reasonable with how many fans you're
plugging into the Y splitter and then
you had some questions about PWM stuff
we'll come back to that with our fan
content in the future go more quick ones
one of them so this one how do
dealing with from ash borer how to
delete it with liquid metal temperatures
compared to soldered CPU temperatures do
you ever plan to deal it a risin CPU and
test results under the assumption that D
lighting provides better temperatures so
I don't mind that Intel doesn't solder
anymore as an enthusiast I want to do it
anyway and if it's not soldered it's
easier to deal it if it's if it's
soldered you won't have to deal it is
more or less the answer to that question
if it's soldered they've done all the
work for you there's no reason to have
liquid metal it's gonna perform within a
couple degrees in the best-case scenario
and solder may be a bit ahead and maybe
a bit I would assume a bit ahead dare
Bower did a video on this he deal it at
arisin seven CPU and the variance was
not that great so yeah I mean it same
what I just said is all that needs to be
said I guess if it's soldered deal it in
is basically irrelevant at that point
next question armand be mod my out of
stock
damn miners yes well the gamers Nexus
anti-static mod mat is well known for
being used in factories in China that
are filled with GPU mining equipment I
guess if you want one though they're on
backorder and they will be shipping end
of this month or early next month so get
them before the miners do I guess last
question nori the explorer.exe what is
an important fact viewers should know
about gamers Nexus and the opposite what
is a big misconception viewers have
expressed about gamers Nexus important
fact if I'm taking it seriously is
probably that we've been doing this for
about 10 years so a lot of experience in
the game started with gaming content
almost exclusively didn't really get
into PC hardware stuff till maybe 2010
in terms of like editorial work I'd
always worked on it personally but PC
hardware maybe 2010 2012 areas where I
started getting more serious about it
and basically pivoted the site to
hardware coverage instead of games
coverage gaming coverage there was
understand I have a lot of contacts in
the game industry
still but we always don't talk to them
as much anymore
it was interesting because it gives you
a really good understanding of things
like game graphics game programming game
engine limitations all these things that
if I had started in state and hardware I
wouldn't really understand and so
knowing a bit extra obviously there's an
impossible now to know but knowing a
little bit more about game development
and game engine development from those
starting years before we got into
hardware has been really helpful in
understanding how to test different
aspects of games and in understanding
how the games interact with the computer
hardware what happens when you toggle
different settings on what do the
settings names even mean that's all
stuff I learned from the early days
covering basically games exclusively
about ten years ago so I would say
that's an important fact that people
know we started as a Games coverage
outlet and it has provided me with a
unique perspective on Hardware coverage
that I think we've been able to leverage
with some things like our Final Fantasy
coverage recently misconception I think
Budokan in the ask GN basically answered
this for me something about shredding
are we I'll use that as a as an
opportunity to plug the GN Steve
side-channel where we've been uploading
our patreon behind-the-scenes videos
some of them go live subscribe to that
channel if you haven't because every now
and then we'll set a patreon
behind-the-scenes video public for
everyone and that's where it will exist
so if you're subscribed there you'll get
it as far as shredding our I've got some
some downhill mountain biking videos
over there where I've done things like
talk about coffee like and rise in the
while riding down the mountain at
Whistler and I don't know we have some a
line footage or something we can show
while we're at it so that's it for this
one is always subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow and resent axis dogs
out directly or get the extra version of
this ask GN and stored on cameras axis
dotnet to pick up one of our mod mats on
backorder
they'll be here very soon for the second
round so thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
