episode as always it leave your
questions in the comment section below
and we also have a patreon version of
this so it's a shorter bonus episode on
patreon.com slash gamers nexus where
we'll post that if you want to get
access to that one or post in our
discord where I can see your questions
there too so for this week we have a few
ones about cooling about overclocking
Headroom where does money go for
high-end motherboards so we'll talk
about that before that this video is
brought to you by our limited-edition
foil anniversary shirt this shirt
commemorates our ten-year anniversary
design and is available in foil on a
high quality cotton shirt completely
custom designed for GN we're making a
limited amount of these and then we'll
never make them again so get your
pre-order in now to ensure you get yours
go to store like Aaron's Nexus net to
grab the GN soil teardown anniversary
shirt now just before getting to the
first question as you saw hopefully and
probably the ad before this section this
is our new shirt it's a limited edition
shirt it's kind of meta because it's
it's a one-year anniversary of a 10 year
anniversary
shirt design so we're making a limited
amount of these once they're sold that's
it they're gone rot making more if you
want to get one you can pre-order yours
on store documents Nexus not net we're
taking pre-orders just to figure out the
size distribution so that we can order
the right amount of each size and then
it'll be a limited quantity once we
figure that out so grab it there if you
want to pick it up it is a silver foil
print basically and looks pretty damn
cool and also shiny for the teardown
logo design first question is from
spacejam flam who says why the sweet
 our cooler master AIO is so cheap
what's the catch the catch is that they
are not good so i several months ago
tried to review one of these because of
the reason you're asking they're cheap
and the problem we had was it leaked and
I think that's a pretty common problem
so our leak was because there are
there's like zero protection between
where the screw for the fan goes in and
a pipe in the radiator typically a CLC
is designed in a way that see
got a metal plate behind the screw so if
a screw is too long it will hit the
plate and no damage is caused or the
fins are behind the screw have you been
fins it's really completely irrelevant
it's not gonna matter at the end of the
day if you drive a screw in there though
and it hits a water line that's a
problem so what happened here I used the
screws that coolermaster included but
the tolerance between them was pretty
large I don't remember exactly what it
was but it was like nearly a millimeter
or something and one of them was long
enough to hit a water line and cause a
rupture and leak all the fluid out so we
never reviewed it and fortunately was
able to save the test bench because it
wasn't on but it's just the design fault
you can work around it hopefully they
fixed the problem by now it's been
months so I would hope that the screws
are tighter tolerances or just shorter
rather than longer when there is a
tolerance issue so maybe that problems
fixed cooling wise they're also not
impressive I don't know if there's
enough interest maybe I'll buy another
one and kind of demonstrate it but
there's a reason they're cheap and
that's part of it the leakage problem
the other one being performance is
really not that great like you're better
off buying a decent air cooler for the
same price then a low end liquid cooler
and a lot of instances because low on
liquid coolers the points of failure the
extra point of failure is exaggerated
just because like if you're spending 60
dollars on low end liquid versus high
end air high end air that fan might die
in like 17 years but the pump who knows
what kind of problems you have with that
including pump line next question is
from frantic killer who says how much
additional overclocked head room can we
expect from a full model bla covering
both the CPU and VRMs isn't even worth
it hopefully you can do thermal tasking
for comparison I'll send you a monoblock
if you need it also thanks for the great
content so when it comes to overclocking
we did a pretty good content piece that
answers this on the Asus Rampage 6
extreme and the problem with that board
was the vrm had absolutely no way to
dissipate all the heat that it was
creating from a higher overclock
especially with an 18 core CPU or 14
core CPU or something like that
so when you're talking about vrm is
really the the limiting
is it thermal throttling is it hitting a
point where protections are kicking in
if it's not then really as long as the
CPU is reasonably cool and the vrm is
within spec there's not gonna be a huge
difference in performance keeping the
vrm colder to a point of say like 50
degrees Celsius as opposed to 90 it's
not really gonna matter at the end of
the day keeping it colder at say 90 or
70 or whatever versus 140 that matters
because you might be tripping over
thermal protect or over temperature
protection at that point OTP or some
other issues high current applications
will strain VRMs that don't have a good
cooling system on them already so the
new motherboards rx-3 99 are looking a
bit better some of the x-force 70 boards
like that gigabyte one have proper
finned heat sinks those do really well
and don't even need the performance EVGA
x2 99 dark has fans on it one of the the
Asus zenith board has a fan on the BRM
so you don't really need a monoblock in
most cases just a fan will suffice but
for purposes of fitting with your
open-loop system you might as well go
with it if you feel like it looks better
and if you think it's gonna be easier or
quieter than installing more fans near
the vrm that's really the only thing but
keeping of V rhymes not like a GPU if
you keep a VM really cold it's not going
to perform significantly better for your
frequency then say like if you keep a
GPU at 40 degrees versus 80 that'll make
a big difference but the BRM does not
behave the same way next also they can
take a hell of a lot of heat as I said
150 is a common over temperature
protection point and they start
de-rating sort of 125 to 150 range for
MOSFETs and for inductors capacitors are
more limited but they also tend to not
have the same thermal problem capacitors
you might have five thousand hours of
life at 105 degrees Celsius or something
but they rarely reach that temperature
unless it's really poorly designed next
question is actually a really
interesting one static albatross says
where does money go on high-end
motherboards it seems like high quality
motherboards with good overclocking
features tend to have a lot of non
performance extras like I'm about two
covers higher end audio Wi-Fi more RGB
in all caps
cetera how much do these features not
have cost and consumer the RGB is the
one I'm gonna focus on so I did have
time to talk to some people in the
industry who make motherboards and other
components and the answer for RGB like
let's say you have a really high end
overclocking board by the time you're at
the point of putting LEDs on it it's a
couple bucks so a lot of the time you're
talking five maybe ten dollars
difference in reasonable MSRP impact
unless it's a marketing thing where they
can just mark it up a ton because
they're the only vendor who does it or
whatever that's not the case anymore so
typically it's like five to ten bucks to
add some LEDs if they're doing something
like the digital RGB LEDs like the MSI
lightning card that we saw at Computex
2017 then it starts costing a lot more
because you need a ton of LEDs to get
that effect to look good and that cost
money so that cost more with the digital
RGB LED light pipes and stuff like that
but if it's just LEDs all over the board
doesn't cost a whole lot so fortunately
doesn't impact consumer price in theory
very much like the bomb caught the bill
of material cost is low and so unless
they're marking it up like a thousand
percent it shouldn't really impact a
whole lot other features m dot 2 covers
metal covers anything that's like shaped
or tooled or anything like that that can
cost a lot because tooling cost a lot
just depends on how they make it if it's
like injection molded if it's plastic or
if it's if it literally requires a tool
in like a punch or something like that
some big machinery to make it those cost
a lot more but all the stuff you're
talking dollars from the most part Wi-Fi
can cost a lot so Wireless is high
single digits for pricing for most of
the wireless cards that you see on
motherboards these days low double
digits in some instances things like
certifications to have different vendor
first party vendor logos on the board I
won't specify but those can cost a lot
too so a lot of your money goes towards
the vrm for the most part and then if
it's got a lot of metal on it that
requires custom stamping or anything
like that like the vrm heat sinks can
cost a lot of money too just because
it's a whole lot of metal so if they do
some complex design with it that's where
some of your money goes most what's the
actual vrm though next question that
quick
shot gaming would the i-580 600k
outperform the 7700 k and video editing
6 core 6 threads versus 4 cores 8
threads we have a video on Adobe
Premiere performance with the 8700 K and
thread Ripper and high end Intel CPUs
our findings were that generally
speaking a spec well this is specific to
Adobe Premiere with Adobe Premiere
you're better off with a high frequency
lower core count device with an IGP than
anything else and the video quality
output is non-existent if you're
uploading to YouTube especially so
people who say but you rendered on a GPU
it's gonna look worse
no you were wrong for purposes of
YouTube it compresses the hell out of
stuff so much that it actually it's just
invisible the differences if you could
even tell them it has to be really high
bitrate so that might be correct in some
applications but not our specific
application and for that reason using a
lower end CPU with an IGP basically out
reforms or performs equally to a lot of
the h EDT stuff 8600 capers 7700 k
whichever one clocks higher for Adobe
Premiere is going to be better and then
beyond and it's also negligible at that
point especially because you should be
CUDA accelerating anyway and then beyond
that as long as the application is
heavily multi-threaded then more threads
will be better than not it just kind of
depends on the application blender for
example is pretty multi-threaded and we
have benchmarks on blender for the 8600
cavers is the 7700 specifically if you
want to see those results I don't have
them off top my head next question is
from Steam ed who said stt stream ed
says in the future would it be possible
to make the mouse oh the mousepad have
black and blue colors no offence it
looks great just too bright for a
mousepad for me so this we kind of
silently posted a new mousepad design
that we have on the store haven't I
guess this is the announcement of it but
we'll do something more official later
but we've got a white and blue mousepad
design that we did and tracks very well
looks great it is white and blue so if
those colors don't work for you we're
considering a black and blue option but
let me know in the comments how
interested you are in the one we've
post-its on stored a game is a nexus net
if you want to look at it it's not out
yet that's why
officially announced it or anything but
take a look if you like it for the
unique white and blue design awesome you
can grab it there if you want the same
design but black and blue let me know
and then we do have other mousepad
designs coming forward as well it's just
it's a matter of obviously it takes time
to make all this stuff but we are trying
to make multiple designs to appeal to
everyone next question the Phoenix I
noticed that you and no other tech
channels are talking about the stock
prices and changes for NVIDIA Intel and
the etc is there a reason of just not
the category of your channel is okay so
is this for a reason or just not the
category of your channel I think it's
what they meant to say I am qualified
attack to talk about technology and
hardware I'm not qualified to talk about
stock prices in the stock market the two
might have overlap for some people but
we focus on the technology so we don't
talk about stock prices unless I might
mention it like in a news video but I'm
not going to advise for or against
purchasing stock because it's not my
place in this machine there are other
people who can do that next question is
from Grimm 12 who says would it make
sense in theory at least ignoring cost
and efficiency to intentionally buy an
overkill graphics card for a given
performance level to minimize noise and
heat output sort of if noise is a big
problem then yes you spent more to get
rid of it so something like the FT w3
ultra silent it's a fat card it has a
really big thin stack on it and that
anything with a large radiator or fin
stack will dissipate the heat over wider
surface area doesn't require the fans to
spin up as early or for as high of an
RPM and that will reduce your noise
levels but you pay more because more
metal and obviously it's the other
problem here is when you get into like
ultra silence like neurotic level of
silence the issue is it's a low volume
part so low volume parts cost more to
make because they can't make as many of
them so they don't get volume discounts
so it can be worth it it's just how much
do you really care about the noise
because you can do stuff on your own to
like just get better cooling in your
case this is a problem with case design
is there's a limit to how much you can
stifle silence by just putting plastic
walls in front of everything
versus designing it with good airflow
and running lower rpms which can address
the same problem but either way if you
get enough airflow into your case and
you custom tune the fan profile on the
video card assuming it's not a garbage
cooler you can make up a lot of ground
without having to buy the special fancy
ultra silent cards it's just those make
it easier if you want something out of
the box they typically have fan profiles
that are tuned lower as well so they
don't get the same clock but they are
quieter out of the box if you can do
that tuning on your own I would advise
that you do it as long as you get a
baseline card that's not complete
garbage because those exist too and then
you should be fine and save a couple
bucks as well
Corwin says do you make use of a torque
driver to standardize mounting pressures
during thermal testing with there be
much advantage of this when it comes to
things like core Delta's we do use
torque drivers for some stuff so like
for example when we did that mounting
pressure comparison i think with the
vega cards where we had a mounting
pressure paper that sort of color eise's
as it receives force that's done with a
torque driver to make sure that it's the
same amount of force in the same spots
every time the screw pattern we do is
the same - for that specific testing
anyway just to make sure that it's the
same like corner to corner
exact corner screws that were screwing
in at the same time in the same order
same amount of force all that stuff to
standardize it for coolers yes but for
the most part with coolers if you're
just tightening to a point where it
stops turning within reason that will do
pretty much the same thing but we do
have torque drivers I think there's one
of the wall behind me somewhere for when
we need those last question is from pyro
CF he says for the average overclocker
is there much benefit to increasing the
cpu current capability past 100% I've
not noticed it increased stability
performance
just just temperatures I'm guessing that
non extreme overseas you're not going to
be hitting a power limit we I don't know
it depends on your board I guess but I
hit power limits all the time or current
limits all the time by not changing that
setting so depends partly on the board
and the CPU and how much you're
overclocking but with an 8700 K for
example or with even the Intel nook we
were working on current limits are
pretty easy to hit so if you're really
overclocking I would advise uncapping
the current limit or we're pushing it to
a level you feel comfortable with
because you will current throttle in
scenarios that draw more current like
for example Cinebench does a decent
amount of amperage prime95 does a lot
blender does a good amount so anything
like that where you're pushing more
current through an overclock then the
motherboard will allow for you should on
cap it but each motherboard is going to
have a different OCP or current throttle
territory for the CPU each CPU has
different tolerances as well for where
they sort of cut off the current versus
versus whatever they think is reasonably
said I don't know it depends on the
board so some of the board's we work
with have a 50 amp hard limit some of
them with 8700 K is at 4.9 gigahertz I
was hitting current limits so I would
recommend uncapping it generally
speaking performance is not going to be
directly derived from a current limit
aside from eliminating a throttle point
that's really the only thing to be
concerned about and that's it for this
one as always you can post your
questions below for the next episodes
we'll probably do two of these for this
week and we've got the patreon episode
