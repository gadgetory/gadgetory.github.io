at PAX West 2016 looking at a new power
link that they're showing off here for
the first times this is actually a bit
difference we normally see this type of
copies at CES things like that balls got
the GG 87 behind us before getting to
that this coverage is brought to you by
iBUYPOWER
and the new elements gaming PC which has
a full tempered glass side window LEDs
in the front and bottom and tempered
glass in the front as well so let's
start with the power link this is the
new product that's probably the most
interesting just because it is kind of a
neat thing this isn't solely built for
cable management so we saw this at
Computex it was an early model and it's
changed a bit since then
the main way it has changed is actually
response to what a few of you said in
the comments previously where these
power connectors on this side nearby and
here actually now are movable so
previously the concern was if they are
fixed then it might not fit all video
cards that's been resolved you can now
use a small screwdriver and access it
through a pull away rubber tab which is
right there in the middle and then move
them up and down as necessary to fit the
video card in terms of the inputs these
are both 8 pins that there will be a 6
pin included with the unit and then on
the input side it's just 2 8 pins so you
plug in both if the video card doesn't
need both 8 pins for all the power it
won't use 300 watts or whatever it may
be pushing obviously it's only gonna
pull whatever is necessary to power the
card internally we can't show it yet but
it's just basically a power routing
system so the rails to move the power
from one side to the other no real
efficiency loss there they're probably
going to be some capacitors or something
like that inside which will help it keep
that efficiency
and then it basically just mounts on the
card I'm sure we'll have b-roll of
amounts on the card like this if we're
using the FTW behind me here so that's
the idea it's just the cable management
tool if you saw the Computex video there
was an LED on it now there's not for
high treason so it is a bit shorter than
previously and the price is to be
determined but probably somewhere the
$30.00 range or something like that for
now as for the DG 87 the last time we
looked at this was CES it was at
Computex as well it's been up for
pre-order now it's here and pretty much
done and ready to be bought so there's
four models of this 87 down to 84 and
that's down skewing so if you buy the 84
it's cheaper than that 87 87 to 20 to
$30 and then the 84 is going to be in
the 100's 150 170 something like that
Japan what you're buying the core specs
of the case this one I'm next to has 8
fans it's a hell of a lot of fans all
140s its intake there's an exhaust and
there's exhaust here as well but the
intakes on the front the case is massive
supports ATX e-atx all that stuff power
supply on the bottom and then this is
sort of instead of expanding the window
downward they've got this mirrored
finish on the outside and then that
actually which it's not on right now
because we've pulled the power link out
but if we're on you'd see the LED
display where the temperatures there's a
temperature indicator and then there's a
fan controller built in on the 87 model
there's also a caboose button if you
want to force your GP to run at max
clocks on again this model HDMI out for
VR things like that
this type-c connector kind of different
for a case that's unique under standard
USB an audio so that's the very basics
of this case might look at it more in
the future but basically it's a massive
case so that's all for the EVGA be with
at PAX West's 2016 as always links to
