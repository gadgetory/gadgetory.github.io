video might be going up after CES but
all the same we're here at the Inman
booth now looking at two new cases
primarily there's a third I'll thrown at
the end though that's kind of special
this is the 301 we'll also be talking
about a modified version of the 303
called the 303 type see before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by cyber power and there's cyber excel
gaming PC though to be relevant they
also have some in win cases in the
rotation so for the 301 this one is
basically a shrunken down version of the
303 if you've seen our 303 coverage you
already know that in terms of the
outside it's basically the same thing
but just smaller the front has red LEDs
in the i/o and the nameplate on the side
still has the single button push to
lower down the window and that is a
tempered glass window the one thing I
really liked about the 303 that I wish
would be applied to more cases is that
touch button to release it had some
thermal concerns but in terms of design
that was pretty good because you're not
dealing with the thumb screws for
everything inside for cooling the case
supports to 120 millimeter front fans or
you can put a 240 millimeter radiator
there there's absolutely no way for the
front of the case to breathe and instead
the air has to come in through the back
side there's some ventilation matching
in the rear panel I would have to test
it to see how effective it is but that
would be where your air would come from
if you front mounted cooling there's
also an option to do to 120 millimeter
bottom fans one of the very back that
would hit your GPU core one towards the
front if you have a bigger GPU that'll
probably hitting the VRM or if not it'll
go up and hopefully get to some kind of
CPU cooler the CPU cooler height is up
to 158 millimeters before you hit the
side panel of course and in terms of
cooling again 240 in the front there's
also support for a 120 millimeter rad or
you can put a 120 millimeter fan in the
rear for exhaust or whatever you might
want to do power supply is top mounted
obviously because we've got two fans at
the bottom so top mounted PSU and then
in front of that is a 2.5 or 3.5 inch
drive cage so it is technically 3.5 on
the spec sheet but could be 2.5 back
side supports 2 2.5 inch SSD trays and
we were not able to take the back panel
off because first
purposes they didn't want us to just
because it's a trade show and they
probably built it last minute and I'm
sure the cables were not managed because
they'd have enough time so we won't be
able to see that but moving on next to
the type-c version of the 303 and now
moving on to the 303 type see this is
again pretty similar to the 303 same
tooling all of that but they've added a
type-c connector to the front and then
some pretty obvious changes to the side
panel there is it's not a laser etching
but some kind of other logo display on
the side and the cool thing here is that
this is actually illuminated on the
panel itself but rather than using a
cable if you release this lever you'll
see it loses the lighting that's because
inside it's just the direct pin contact
- a little very tiny PCB on the side
panel so no cables are required for that
functionality other than that it's the
303 so it's the same thing we reviewed a
while ago three 120 millimeter fans
supported up top right here which is a
unique way to do it you would basically
have to have a radiator there for those
to be effective so you mount your three
120 s or two 120 s and do a 240 set up
and then the power supply mounts here
behind the back 120 millimeter fan I'm
not sure if the cooling support has
changed to adapt it has not so that was
one of my wishes with the 303 review was
that I wanted a 280 millimeter mounting
point because it could actually fit one
in terms of the size it was just there
no mounting points but you could force
it if you wanted to so that hasn't
changed
still the 303 side panel is a big change
the type C port on the front is a big
end relevant change with a m4 and z2 70
on the market still 120 in the back
still put 120 s in the bottom and that I
think pretty much covers it because it's
still the 303 case there to view our
review for that if you want to see how
it works functionally but in terms of
price no price yet on this there's no
price on the 301 if you think of a price
that you would pay for this please leave
a comment below because anyone's looking
for feedback and that would probably
help them figure out what market they
best belong and and now for the final
case we're going to move over to one it
made by Bob Stuart and rod Rosenberg the
monitors from PS mods we saw this in
Taiwan at Computex 2016 it's actually a
real case now so let's go check that out
so the final case like I said combi tax
we covered something like this
almost the exact same actually this was
done again by BS mods the case is built
on the frame of the 509 but the entire
body is obviously completely different
three millimeter thick aluminum for the
paneling and rather than retool the
entire chassis which would of course be
a huge expense they've used standoffs so
in that regard it's pretty smart because
they've got standoffs to mount this
plating on the outside off of the
original frame that way there's no
retooling required the 509 specs are
pretty much the same you can still
figure 140 in the back power supply
still in the bottom all that stuff but
with the medieval metal that's never the
case styling of the case this was done
by in one's factory they're now actually
going to at least somewhat mass-produce
it rather than just be a one-off mod for
the contest that was hosted in Taiwan
last year the sword is a machined on
both sides and it obviously serves as
the i/o which is kind of cool and then
the power buttons right here in the
pommel of the sword with the cross guard
being actual just thick aluminium it's
all the way through aluminum which is
probably a significant cost but it looks
at damn good the styling here these
little divots they are calling scallops
and that is all going to be CNC do I
believe the name of the case like I said
medieval metal is kind of a working name
you can go to the BS mods Facebook page
and I think they're going to be hosting
a contest there at some point to
potentially rename it and then the
winner will receive one of the cases
which is significant because the price
is about a thousand dollars it's very
expensive case but that is sort of what
anyone does with their cases so if you
know and when you know what to expect
for price this is not something that I
would probably review for function it is
definitely a forum type of case it comes
with no fans like most of the other ones
we've looked at you buy your own fans
buy your own components set it up how
you like you'd probably want a liquid
coil at your intakes on the front and
there is a sort of Templars cross in the
front with LED illumination from the
setup that they have but you could set
that up on your own if you wanted to the
mesh for the Templars cross is some kind
of punching from their factory which we
did a factory Torrance all the machining
was pretty damn cool if you want to
check that out we have a video from the
factory tour in Taiwan last
here so that's it for the in one booth
for CES 2017 you can find all our
