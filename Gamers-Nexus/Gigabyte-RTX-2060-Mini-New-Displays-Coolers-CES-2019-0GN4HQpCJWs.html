CES 2019 and gigabyte has a lot of stuff
to show they have a whole wall behind me
and then there's a another wall in the
other room so we're gonna try and go
through almost all the stuff here today
but I think the big one to start with is
probably going to be the RT X 2060 video
cards because they just launched or at
least to the press sorry you can't have
one yet before that this video is
brought to you by thermaltake scorpy
three case the core p3 is one of the
most unique cases on the market it can
serve as an open-air standing chassis a
test bench in vertical or horizontal
orientation or as a wall mounted
showcase pc the core p3 now comes with a
5 millimeter thick tempered glass panel
for its side but keeps the front top and
back open for air the core p3
versatility as a display piece test
bench or standard desktop is reinforced
by its price of roughly 110 dollars on
Amazon you can learn more at the link in
the description below the cards that are
on display here couple models so in
order of price we don't have firm pricey
numbers yet but just in in terms of the
stack how they'll line up the 2060 OC
follows and gigabytes traditional naming
scheme so 2060 OC kind of at the low end
we're not clear on if it'll come to the
North American market but maybe not and
if it doesn't what will come to the
North American market is the wind force
OC so this is a dual axial cooler design
it's pretty straightforward we know it's
a different PCB and vrm than previously
the PCB measurements are the same but
the vrm components are different I just
I don't know what exactly those
components are today so we're gonna try
and find that out for you four separate
coverage on what MOSFETs are using what
voltage controller all of that stuff so
not clear on what that is just yet but
it is a dual axial cooler it's got a
couple of heat pipes and then a pretty
simple heatsink so this is going to be a
more affordable option the game you know
see is a triple fan design so a triple
axial single eight pin on both of these
cards following the 2060 spec pretty
straightforward there and I mean it's
it's just a slightly higher end model
it's got a backplate like most the
others these days and we'll just have to
wait and see what the the vrm component
specification is hopefully that will
stay in place so that's the game you
never see this one I think will interest
more people
small so this is the Mini ITX OC and
you've seen these cards before we use a
similar card to this a 1070 model in our
Mini ITX test bench and it's I mean it's
it's a small card and actually we're
just talking with another vendor about
how small cards and the 20 series that
are also 2 slot pretty hard to find so I
think so tax coming out with one but we
haven't seen too many just yet and the
problem here is that as the GTX 10
series dies and gets phased out you're
gonna be left with kind of a gap in
coverage of Mini ITX models where people
are waiting for ITX models but can't buy
attention is because gone and are
waiting for the 20 series to come out an
ITX so that's the start of that one but
that's their video cards we don't have a
ton of details on them just yet we
already reviewed the 2060 you can check
that for performance for the basics of
what the silicon can do and then as far
as what the cooler can do we'll check
back with you later once we can actually
test them I'll briefly mention this so
there's memory we've showed this we
showed this actually at Computex where
gigabyte did something kind of
interesting they had dummy modules so
it's at the time it was a new concept
for them and it was you could buy a kid
of four if you are OCD about your memory
slots and you want all four to be filled
and two of them are fake so it just
brings down the cost while allowing you
to still have the higher capacity for
two sticks but fill in all four slots if
you are neurotic will say about that
kind of thing so all they've shown here
that's different from previously
thirty-six hundred megahertz kit and a
four thousand mega Hertz kit and those
are CL roughly nineteen let's see
thirty-six hundred eighteen nineteen
nineteen for the timings four thousand
nineteen twenty twenty and they are
hynek's CD memory the biggest challenge
of course the memory is the getting on
cue balls from other boards gigabyte
happens to make a lot of motherboards so
it works out there we have not worked
with the memory yet but they've been
upgraded to higher frequencies if that's
something you were interested in but
from the looks ID the interesting part I
guess is the dummy modules which we
showed before let's move on to the tower
cooler and the SSD so this one I don't
need notes for this this is pretty this
is my domain so 163 millimeters tall for
the tower cooler so in terms of
clearance you miss all the 150
millimeter keys
for the the window to board height but
you still hit most the other cases that
are in the mid tower upper mid tower
range in terms of sizing so 163 if you
kind of look at it while it's spinning
it looks like the fans are facing the
same way no it's not a mistake
this one is blowing that direction and
then that one's just a reverse fan blade
design so it's a back swept design you
would call it typically so it looks the
same from the outside about his back
swept so it's pulling air pushing it out
the back of the case and this is called
the ATC 800 so it's the aorist our
cooler I think is what that stands for
800 model again TBD on price don't know
yet TBD on availability this one's a bit
further out than some of the other
products we've looked at like the video
cards which are on the immediate horizon
for roughly January 15th or something
around those around that time based on
on video zone release timing but for the
cooler it's a little while out it is to
120 millimeter fans it's a RGB and I
there is a temp and rpm reader here with
a bar so I'm thinking maybe that will
progress and show some kind of basically
like windows progress complete bar
except for temperature and rpm but we
don't know just yet so that's the cooler
it's a big air cooler below it under the
video card is a PCIe SSD these are using
a 5 on controller it's the 12 II
controller which is pretty new if not
brand-new and these will be coming in a
1 terabyte or 512 gigabyte model for the
PCIe card the add-in card as opposed to
the nvme m dot 2 stick just the stick
which will be 512 or 256 gigabytes for
capacity but it's the same flies on
controller for both so and also it's a
pretty heavy-duty shroud and housing
with RGB LEDs which is what most people
want at this point I suppose although
Kyle did tweet a photo about RGB LEDs
and we will find that and put it on the
screen now I think that covers most the
the core stuff here I do want to point
out a motherboard will walk back over
this way because this was it's not new
technically it came out a couple weeks
ago but it's a Z 390 a RS extreme water
force in terms of BRM and PCB it's
literally an aorist extreme it's the
same other board which we liked and
build Zoid gave it high praise on our
channel
that's a rainy endorsement from him you
got any amount of praise so that's been
modified now to have well it's it's a
water forced water block so it's just
got a pretty much full coverage block
here and it's been out for a couple
weeks but if you hadn't seen it it does
look kind of cool and if you're into
open-loop it might be worth looking into
I don't know if we'll be testing this
one we have a standing offer it's just a
matter of is there interest so if there
is interest let me know in the comments
so that I can I can confirm that and get
it in the office for testing and there's
one more thing I almost forgot it the
monitor so not in this room will have
b-roll for this one the gigabyte monitor
is new for them this is in gigabytes
effort to expand their product line up
into other verticals as well and the
monitor is called let's get this out of
the way first the Eris display 27 QT so
a b27 QD is the name which is actually
one of the more forgiving monitor names
in the market and it's got a couple
specs we can give the more important 27
inch IPS 144 Hertz
it is 1440p dcpip is 98% freesync as
well particularly relevant because
nvidia is now actually supporting that
although they've renamed it and
appropriated the naming for the product
the monitor has built-in power so if you
don't like power bricks that's a
marketing point now I guess is to put it
back in the monitor which we actually
prefer them the power to be in the
monitor not in a brick that sits on the
carpet gets hot but it's gotten so far
the other direction where they need to
be thin that people have forgotten you
can put them in the monitor so gigabyte
has now done that you can kind of add on
some will call them cheating options for
games which actually are pretty cool so
some of this stuff has been done before
some of its more interesting for example
counters or timers you can through the
software we have footage of this you set
a timer so if you know for example an
opponent's ability in a MOBA it will
refresh every 90 seconds or every five
minutes or whatever inset it so that
when you hit the hotkey it'll just start
an onscreen timer that is done through
firmware on the monitor so it should
bypass game anti cheat systems I don't
care about how you feel about this
ethically or in terms of how the game
works but it's it's pretty cool
otherwise so like I said spend on before
and
but this combines a whole bunch of stuff
in one so timer pops up on the screen
you can see exactly when the opponent's
ability should recharge and we're cool
down other stuff you put a reticle on
screen and there's a couple other things
in there too like some adaptive noise
reduction with a mic built into the
monitor that listens to ambient noise
cancels it out in your mic noise as it's
all a process through the software which
is mostly for example for streamers I
think that covers most with one
millisecond if I didn't say that
it's got RGB on the back pivot swivel
tilt are all built in and then OSD built
into the firmware so games like destiny
to can't block it out and HDR 400 so
that covers it that's the gigabyte suite
