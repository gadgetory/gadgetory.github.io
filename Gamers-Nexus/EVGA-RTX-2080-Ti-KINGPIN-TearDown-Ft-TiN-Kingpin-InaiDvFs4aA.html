EVGA and although this video might go up
later so depending when you hear me say
well we're still at EVGA you might think
that we've been here for like two weeks
now but actually just filmed a lot of
videos back-to-back this is the kingpin
20 atti we saw this at CES and this is a
pre-production model but it's pretty
close to production there's a few
changes I'll point out as we go before
that this video is brought to you by the
mass drop and hi-fi man he4 xx planar
magnetic headphones the he4 XX
headphones focus on high quality audio
listening experiences with comfortable
foam cushions for the ear cups comfort
is also ensured with a leather covered
spring steel headband allowing
flexibility and durability against bends
these headphones are capable of
delivering big sound for audio files
while being positioned competitively in
price learn more at the link in the
description below so this we're gonna
disassemble today and primarily look at
the cooling solution faceplate I think
as mostly fine at this point is this as
metally said this actual the shroud is
metal and we have large is like a 100
millimeter fan or a 93 or something like
that so large erm thin and on the
backside just normal backplate some
exposure to capacitors back there in the
top
this is actually an OLED display so we
have some other shots of this running
and on a bench so you can see readouts
for the voltages temperature stuff like
that pretty useful and also clears out
onto pots so you can leave that on there
and still run the card with modified
cooling but this is the stock cooler and
if it's not in the shot yet I'll bring
it in this cooler itself is a 240
milliliter CLC so it's an ace attack CLC
it's a Gen 6 pump we've disassembled Gen
6 pumps in the past and can maybe splice
some footage in and editing so the Gen 6
pump has a metal impeller it's shaped a
bit differently from the Gen 4.5 and 5
pumps impellers where they use that
yellow plastic three-pronged impeller so
in powder quality is much higher in Gen
6 Gen 6 from a performance standpoint we
haven't really seen much thermal
difference but from a
a permeation standpoint is supposed to
be a bit better so that's a newer ASA
tech pump 240 CLC radiator and then two
of the UGA fans they are not the same as
the EVGA CLC 240 fans where it's got the
cut out on the side so it's closed in
fan and also this time unlike some of
the hybrid cards in the past that EVGA
has done you will be able to control the
fan speeds so fan speed is is
controllable this time which is helpful
for noise levels so we got the the four
screws out for it there's sprain
retention spring tension screws for the
cooler on top of the GPU and that's
gonna secure the the cold plate to it
we'll have to take the back plate off
and see if there's any other screws
hiding under there although I do have
kingpin and tin sitting next to me we're
gonna do this as if I were doing it in
the studio without on the outside help
so I'm gonna have to reveal this for
myself and see what's underneath the
back plate and on the the cooler side of
things so Jenn the Jenn six pump having
direct control of the fan is probably
the biggest change versus previous
hybrid cards we've looked at
I guess I'll point out as Vince noted it
aside from silence is helpful for
performance as well because you can
blast the fans beat instead and then
this this screw is part of the
pre-production that's not going to be a
different-colored screw in the final
model so let's see up in this corner
here we have a header that I can show
off to so let's rotate
she's a pro bit header and BIOS which
right here is this dual or triple triple
BIOS triple BIOS up there and you'll be
able to download different the BIOS
revisions if you want to online is the
is this a debug led up here
a little power and also 1.8 damn trouble
okay so a troubleshooting LEDs three pin
or three eight pin connectors evbot
header fan header all right there and is
there going to be a USB yes okay so
there will be a micro B USB once the
card is is finished it's another one of
the pre-production differences so
there'll be three dip switches here for
a load line V droop and what's the other
one what's the third it's different
settings for vrm okay guys one is for
memory one is for view oh I see yeah
ma'am now in GPO okay cool so a lot of
thermal pads on there you are correct
okay so throw pads backside that's kind
of an interesting touch the white out
around the back the GPU does that final
- yeah that's kind of cool actually
any functional reason or just because it
looks different which goes fixture on
top and bottom okay okay so there's a
reason for this white square here but we
can't talk about it
uh-huh alright so there's the back of
the PCB there's a one shunt resistor
back here and then I think we're free to
take apart the front of the car -
because I can feel that it's loose so if
this is like the other EVGA cards then
it should just be the four screws
holding and the yep holding in the CLC
cold plate and we don't need to take
this cold plate apart today but we've
done it before so if you do want to see
actually we can just cut in some some
footage to have a Gen 6 disassembly it's
they're all pretty much the same
although this cold plate is is modified
so EVGA has got protruding cold plate
here which was done on the
previous hybrid cards as well we
actually did test previously where we
swapped cold plates on coolers and it
does it does actually help on GP cooling
to have the protrusion I'm assuming you
saw the same results it helps with
thermals because so when we were
speaking with one of our contacts ages
ago the flat cold plates that are used
for CPUs traditionally have a slight
bend to them they're slightly concave I
think it is and so going with a
protrusion EVGA can use a flatter plate
for GPUs because they don't have an IHS
that's got a curve to it so that's the
primary difference for those does this
will this card come with the kingpin
paste on it no okay so this is just a
production or a testing pace will have
standard paste on it and then the
interesting part here we're getting to
now so here's the memory plate and we've
seen this before as well on a lot of
different cards including the hybrids
but this is just a copper plate that is
going to be connected by a thermal paste
to the cooler so you can see some
thermal paste on the edges here around
the protrusion on the cold plate and
that's what's making contact the memory
plate so it's a copper memory plate and
then that's I think this should be free
yes this is free as well and this is the
cold plate for the memory I believe one
of the other pre-production secrets is
that there's a screw in the thermal pad
so as this vents or was this 10:10 so
this is clearly not that's clearly not
final although the indentation in the
thermal pad probably is final so that
comes off this is just just to be clear
here this is just what happens when
you're working in a development
environment taking stuff apart all the
time I'm sure tin has screws hidden in
all kinds of other thermal pads
throughout the lab I probably just
hiding them from kingpin so it doesn't
take his screws so there's the plate for
the memory the idea here is as we've
explained before is it's you've got a
protruding copper plate coming down and
we're getting getting getting is this
is this a common problem so the cold
plate comes down contacts the memory and
you're sharing thermal solutions so
technically the memory sinking into the
same plate as ultimately the GPU is
going to raise the GPU temperature a
little bit but it's a balancing act of
do you want to cool the the memory with
a bit more do you want to be a bit more
serious with your memory coin because if
the losses from sharing a thermal
solution are less than the gains from
pulling the memory of it better than
it's obviously worth it so in this
instance I believe kingpin was saying
that in testing there wasn't really any
difference in clocks sharing the plate
versus not I saw better performance it's
not better performance on the memory
side sharing the GPU decrease in
performance not you right so yeah so
better cane pin saw better force on the
memory side with sharing the solution
than the loss from not sharing the
solution and this right here I should
know this will be copper plated as well
so this is a pre-production artifact but
aluminum heatsink will be copper plated
aluminum heatsink that is copper plated
currently these look the same at the end
of things and GPU die these are going to
be hand selected for the kingpin cards
and then the vrm is under this which we
need to take off still so let's let's
remove that I'm not sure if I already
freed it or not but there it's
disconnect to the fans we have two
headers one for the I suppose pump and
fan control and then one for the vrm fan
and this should be loose probably yes it
is loose okay
just have all the inductors come off
with it yes so the reason that took some
force is because as EVGA does they went
crazy with their own pads ever ever
since the icx cards came out it's been
thrown pads everywhere inductors to film
that everything's a bat I looked over
you to see if it was darling like no
reaction usually just this one give a
warning it sounds like the t-rex it's a
pressure release to deplete all the
oxygen from the step so this is a very
very busy half of the PCB so are all the
components final at this point okay
MPs 1814 is that what that is a MP
eighty six nine five nine nine five six
okay
MP eighty six nine five six okay so it's
a sixty M power stage we can have maybe
have build Zoid doing analysis of this
as well so yeah there's PCBs both off
the last heatsink and there's the other
half of the via ROM and this heat sink
will will change I have a question for
you
does the supplier of these components
put the dot on it or yeah that's me that
means it's pre-programmed to the
firmware so essentially these are
digital controllers and when you give
them the image to flashing to chip they
will do that
out of the board and then
supply the components to the assembly
house and then they will put all the
components on there yeah okay cool
the reason for that is you want to have
different colors because they're firmer
can be different but cheap will look the
same the model member is the same so you
don't confuse the assembly house right
makes sense cool sometimes they are like
labels like the small sticker would they
like Gaussian number or stuff like that
on the bigger chips Maria all right so
that's the the kingpin Edition 20 atti
and we're more looking at the
disassembly process and the cooler today
but I guess we'll get some photos and
some of them over to build to it as well
he can do a full video on the vrm side
of things because that's his domain so
that's it for this one check back for
