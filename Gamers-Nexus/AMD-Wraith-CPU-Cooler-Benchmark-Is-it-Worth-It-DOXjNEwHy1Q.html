surface area of the aluminum heatsink by
24 percent and it's a good deal larger
than the previous cooler if you look at
the two of them here side-by-side and
even larger still then the cooler before
that the race the reason for launch is
primarily a refresh of the existing FX
line particularly the FX 83-70 and it is
launching at the same price as the
current FX 83-70 cpus but the old cooler
will be available for $10 cheaper with
the FX 83-70 so you pay 190 instead of
200 the Wraiths cooler uses the larger
heatsink surface area and it also has a
new fan which spins at a significantly
slower rpm and this is a good thing
because the previous cooler if you've
ever used them spins up to a maximum of
about 5500 rpm we get 50 to 52 and the
new cooler is about 29 47 rpm so it is
almost half it's about 40% of the
original rpm and the cooling as you'll
see momentarily is pretty comparable so
that does mean that the AMD stock
coolers will finally stop making the
shrill Banshee shrieking noise the Theia
that the older models have made and
that's something that we tested so let's
talk about all that you can view the
test methodology link to the description
below we've got that all in the article
if you want to know how we tested how
our automation sort of works at a very
top level and things like that keep all
of the testing accurate and fairly
transparent also note quickly there's no
objective decibel level analysis at this
time because we don't have the tools for
right now we're investing in thermal and
if we can't do it right we don't do it
at all subjectively what I can tell you
is that the old cooler at its maximum
rpm is absolutely unusable this is the
previous model not the new one so the
old cooler was so loud and such a high
frequency that anywhere beyond maybe the
halfway point the 3,000 rpm mark it was
just unbearable and really caused a lot
of stress to sit next to so the new
cooler even at its 3,000 rpm is
generally quieter than the system and
GPU fans in our test bench so that makes
it more or less inaudible or
imperceptible and fan noise or any noise
is logarithmic so it's not really just
as simple as saying you can add a couple
more decibels and that's what you expect
the output to be but generally you
should expect a very slight increase in
noise from the Wraiths cooler the old
cooler was substantially louder to the
point that it is actually the loudest
device I've ever tested short of a
server fan at 12,000 rpm or something
like that let's look at something for
which we do have objective benchmarks
and analysis so this chart shows the
equalized temperatures for peak load
averaged thermals on the different
coolers on the bench so we look at the
thermals over time there's another chart
for that and then we average the peak
thermal area there's a set area and
every test where that happens we average
that and then we get a value to three
significant figures which you can see
here that we averaged out from a two
significant finger measurement and you
can read all that in the article
so the a.m. the Wraiths cooler at its
maximum 2,900 rpm or less was pushing a
forty one point zero seven four Celsius
and that third figure is actually
important here because if you look at
the old stock cooler at its maximum loud
rpm it was pushing 41 point zero seven
eight so that is a very small
imperceptible barely measurable
difference we can only measure it
because we log for such a long period of
time and we use accurate instruments so
it's unnoticeable to the average user
except for one thing and that's the RPM
and the noise so in order to achieve the
same cooling performance as the Wraiths
the old cooler had to operate at two
times almost anyway the speed and that
made it much louder it's idle
temperature was also a bit higher at six
point two nine four Celsius versus four
point eight three six Celsius of the
Wraiths and that is again not really
something you're going to notice in your
rig but it is just noteworthy because it
shows a clear cooling advantage for the
Wraiths and that is likely a result of
its larger surface area so even though
they're about the same under load the
larger surface area of the fins will
help drive down those thermals during
idle periods just by nature of having
more fins to sink the heat into and then
dissipate it here's where it gets more
interesting so we take the old stock
cool and we clock it down so to speak to
the same revs as the AMD ray
at about 2900 rpm the noise level is
fairly comparable from a subjective
standpoint it is not too different with
the old stock cooler and the cooling
performance is actually noticeably
different so it's now about a 5 Celsius
more or less gain for the stock cooler
the new one versus the old one so you
get 41 point zero seven four versus
forty six point nine and that's again
not super noticeable but when you're
talking about coolers ultimately you're
just fighting over a couple Celsius and
a 5 Celsius differential is actually
pretty massive when it comes to the
world of cooling especially with air if
we look at something more standard for
an aftermarket cooler you can see the NR
max t40 fit up there the top they use a
140 millimeter fan it spins at much
slower speeds 1,200 rpm so it's
significantly quieter to the point that
your other fans will be louder and this
is true for most aftermarket coolers of
this spec it's a $40.00 cooler so it's
not just an animatic saying that is true
for most of those coolers and that is at
thirty eight point seven eight Celsius
so not a huge advantage over the Wraith
or the old cooler even at max rpm anyway
but the noise levels are again what
you're looking at here and it is of
however a big difference from the old
cooler at 2900 rpm so if you want
something that's quieter and more
tolerable then the Wraith would probably
be the way to go short of buying an
aftermarket cooler and the Wraith is
going to be about ten dollars more so
that the price isn't changing of the
83-70 still 200 bucks but the old one
goes down to 190 that makes the rate ten
dollars more and if you wanted to bump
up to a sort of entry level
air-cool you'd be spending at least $25
on average from hyper 212 to an AR 0 1
or something like that and that we think
generally is worth it for anyone doing
any kind of overclocking or prolonged
system service life because you'll want
that extra few degrees to help eke out
more life from the CPU or the
neighboring VRMs and that's another
thing we don't show here is that if you
have a larger cooler there's actually
some potential to sink some heat from
the BRM especially if there's vapor
chambers and both involved and the
Wraith won't do that as much but let's
get to the conclusion
here so the rate is a good cooler and so
far as stock coolers go it is actually
the best stock cooler out right now
comparing against Intel the old Andy and
the new Andy and for that we hope AMD
will continue in the future because the
wraith is good enough that we can
actually say if you're buying the cpu
you're not planning to overclock and you
don't necessarily intend to have long
system service life then yeah you can
stick with the wraith because it's a
tolerable noise level and it's
reasonably cool comparatively anyway now
for anyone doing serious stuff we still
recommend aftermarket and this isn't
really addressing the question of buying
an FX processor am3+ platform at all
we're just talking about coolers here
because generally my feeling anyway and
the kind of feeling of the site is that
the FX line and am3+ line are old enough
now five years old with am3+ that it's
sort of becoming an odd choice to buy
because ends right around the corner if
you really want Andy and Intel is just
cooler and quieter and perform similarly
for games it's different story sometimes
with certain applications but generally
speaking the older architecture is a bit
more difficult to work with
it's got PCIe limitations it's got USB
three non-native limitation so you have
to get an aftermarket chip start it onto
the board and create USB three that way
and it just kind of becomes a little
messy when you start doing that sort of
stuff you can create issues with IO
transfer rates or hannes and freezes and
things like that which don't happen on
many of the platforms out there but
they've certainly happened on some of
the ones we've tested so generally am3+
FX I'm not a huge proponent of
recommending at this point because the
other processor is so close but if you
are buying one then probably do get the
wraith model if you plan to not use an
aftermarket cooler because it is
substantially better than the old stock
one if you're buying an aftermarket
cooler well I just gave you the answer
you buy the old one you throw out the
cooler so that is all for this I hope to
see Andy continue the wraith cpu cooler
with their next line as the cpu
hopefully become more relevant again and
the LED on the side is kind of a nice
touch there's a white LED on the side of
it but you know
it's an LED so not much to say about
