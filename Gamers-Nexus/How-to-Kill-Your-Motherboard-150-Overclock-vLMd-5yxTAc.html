extinguisher and the thumbnail will
refrain from the bomb emoji and the
hashtag FBI involved hashtag fire aspect
to the title what we're doing today is
looking at basically how to blow up your
motherboard vrm so the point of this is
to illustrate that it's actually
depending on board and what you're doing
an overclocking it can be quite easy to
exceed or nearly exceed the safe
temperatures for vrm components on a
motherboard in this example we're using
a board with no heat sinks on the VRMs
and we're also overclocking it as high
as we'll be able to so this is an
example of where a user who has just
seen overclocking done online on a
particular CPU or product gets the idea
that hey it's not hard to overclock this
thing and they go about doing it without
necessarily thinking out the
consequences and when one should
overclock to what frequency and voltage
before that this video is brought to you
by the new cable mod pro series cable
mods a new pro cables come with
pre-installed closed combs for clean
builds accompanied by a revamp to color
style and vibrance the cables are now
using thicker wires and they've also
added right-angled internal USB 3
extension and right angled SATA data
cables by the pro series cable kits at
the link below or customize it your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below so this should be pretty
fun it's going to be partly a what
happens if anything when you severely
overheat the vrm components we've done
MOSFET testing in depth like this in the
past with the EVGA ACX cards but now
we're revisiting it on a motherboard
that has no heat sinks and what we're
doing is measuring the SOC vrm component
temperatures while we do some live
overclocking I have two thermocouples
set up right now on MOSFETs and they're
just going into a thermocouple reader
which right now is reading fairly high
at thirty five ish degrees Celsius for
each one room temperature is about
twenty twenty to twenty one right now
degrees Celsius and part of what we're
testing here is also what happens when
you have no airflow so this is a worst
case scenario we have more of this
testing coming up inside an actual case
as well if you're interested but if you
think of a case like maybe a bit Phoenix
ENSO which I
face the zero airflow unless you create
airflow manually up in the top of the
case has knows no airflow really so you
have a case like that maybe you put a
closed-loop liquid cooler on it and the
radiator is mounted in the front of the
case so it's not even close to the V RMS
this is a real scenario that can happen
there is no airflow and also there are
no heat sinks on the VRMs so right now
just ambient we are 10 degrees above
ambient just by the V RMS running
sustaining windows with nothing going on
and with no case even but it has no air
flow over it so this is our scenario
we've setup it is a worst case scenario
to show again what happens when you push
things too far and what is too far to
push the V our own components all right
so right now we're just gonna set up
some basic overclocks and step through
them and watch as the temperatures rise
just for fun this is all really kind of
for fun right now it's not necessarily
like a guide or anything so I'm doing
here is I've set a really super
achievable clock 1500 megahertz we can
go higher than that and 1.15 graphics
voltage I've pushed this particular chip
up to 1,700 sort of but it's stable at
1650 on a different motherboard so we're
gonna see how high we get on this board
and I'm just gonna run fire a strike
loop in while it sorts itself out and
we'll look at temperatures as we go and
keep pushing it so I'm just gonna push
this like a user would when the user is
trying to see what kind of clocks they
can achieve because a lot of people
don't really know that the V RMS exist
or the MOSFETs exist or that they can
overheat or what's a safe temperature
for a MOSFET so I mean I was there a
couple years ago so this is going to
sort of show that even if your CPU
temperature is in check you might have
other things to worry about so right now
we're running at one point one ish for
the SOC voltage and up to one point
yeah about one point one and that's got
our MOSFETs at 53 degrees and rising if
we if we show that so here's our
temperatures this one is going to this
one's going to the MOSFET closer to me
on the SOC VRM
and this smaller number down here in the
corner that you may not be able to see
is going to a MOSFET that's I've
determined as the hottest one that's
closest to the memory also part of the
SOC vrm SOC drives the APU graphics so
APU graphics voltage is SOC voltage more
or less different motherboards tweeted
different ways the amasai boards don't
really do anything currently when you
put an AP graphics voltage you need to
use SOC for that case but the point is
both APU graphics voltage and SOC
voltage go through the SOC PRM so by
overclocking the apu we are pushing
everything through with SOC PRM and the
same would be true for memory on your
cpu so right now we're already at 65
degrees and we really haven't done
anything and it's still climbing so
we're not thermal runaway or anything
but we're definitely getting there and
just while this Rises is to give you an
idea of what kind of safe temperatures
are for VR Emmas it depends on which
component you're talking about it
depends on what component they've used
specifically so when I say which
component you're talking about I mean
choke capacitor MOSFET just crash we'll
get back to it MOSFET capacitor choke
and then after that which version of
each one's a which which specific model
of MOSFET so generally speaking kind of
safe guidance would be for capacitors
you don't really want to exceed about
105 degrees Celsius a lot of the lower
end capacitors like on these boards are
often rated for a 105 degrees Celsius at
5000 hours so and the higher you go over
that you will have lifespans aggradation
so if we're at 105 C on a cap and let's
say we run at 24/7 rendering or mining
or whatever something that you can do
24/7 by the time we've hit about 5,000
hours you can start expecting the ends
of pop and that will depend on the
capacitor some some are at 10,000 hours
and so forth but a lot of be 350 boards
use the cheaper capacitors so this
crashed which means as I use or you'd
say okay time to increase the voltage a
bit so let's just go ahead and do that
we'll push to one point one seven five
and let's start it again and we'll also
have to make sure it's actually doing
something different yeah there we go so
as you'll see in our killing your IMC
video which is coming up this voltage
number is not necessarily what's
actually going through the socket it's
just the closest estimate we can get
through hardware info after accounting
for things like resistance between the
pin and the pad and the distance
traveled you might actually have a
higher voltage or a lower voltage in
reality than what's being shown in
software but that's board dependent and
something we'll talk about separately
load line calibration also comes into
play we're currently on a high load line
calibration so not quite extreme but
high will help us stabilize the voltage
provision a bit all right so we're
coming back to it I've let it sit for
about a minute and we're at 73 degrees
on the main MOSFET again no air flow on
these that's kind of the whole key
factors we know there's no air flow
that's intentional if you have this
board in a crappy case see all of 2017
then it's entirely possibly of no air
flow we're climbing pretty fast at 75
so we've gained five degrees since I
started talking my AP graphics voltage
input is one point one seven five one
point one SOC voltage and we're at 1.15
ish right now for the current voltage or
I should say the present voltage means
confusion it's bouncing around a bit and
either way we're a bit more stable than
last time we're still only at 1500
megahertz so much.we stabilize there
we'll go a little further but first we
need to see how hot the MOSFETs get so
77 degrees right now is where we're at
so 77 see the other MOSFET which is
closer to me or sorry let's see which
one is this this is the okay so the
other MOSFET down here is reading 76
right now that would be the one closer
to the memory and then which is blocking
a lot of the air flow and 79 degrees is
the one that's closer to me those are
both SOC MOSFETs and the liquid cooler
is doing actually pretty well right now
we don't need to pan the camera over
there but I'll check what the CPU
temperature TDI is only 42 degrees which
is completely acceptable so TDI is
totally fine we're not even overclocking
the CPU by the way I'm just messing with
graphics so this would be a lot worse
with CPU overclocking
or a cpu workload even but yeah eighty
degrees now so let's talk about saves
time we're talking about 105 C for low
in capacitors and being at about five
thousand hours of life and with chokes
you can get into one hundred twenty five
hundred fifty degrees territory with
MOSFETs about the same power state as
MOSFETs also looking at one twenty five
really beyond there you start D rating
kind of hard and eventually you have
some kind of failure depending on which
specific MOSFET it is so the big concern
with these components is as a user if
you're not aware these things exist
which is totally fair or you're not
aware that they need to be really
decently cool if you're overclocking
they don't give you signs of failure
it's not like you start seeing
artifacting if your MOSFETs are too hot
you'll just keep running up the
temperatures and eventually something
fails
now hopefully there's a and s VI D
connection somewhere between the CPU and
the component that says at some point
hey I'm 110 degrees now this is still
within spec but we should throttle back
a little bit to prevent a runaway
thermal scenario that happens on a lot
of boards if you've disabled SPID or it
just doesn't have that kind of
protection there's no over temperature
protection on some MOSFETs some VRMs
then you could definitely run into a
scenario where it runs up until
something fails and that will typically
be in a puff of smoke won't probably
won't start a house fire but it'll
certainly kill at least that component
on the motherboard 83 degrees now and we
might be kind of hitting steady-state at
this point and how much power is going
through here let's see how much power is
going through so I'm just going to
current clamp it zero it out current
clamp which is directional so I need to
clamp it that way 5.7 apps right now 5.8
5.7 5.8 let's call it five point eight
so five point eight by twelve point
three we're watching about 71 Watts
right now down the EPS 12-volt cables
with our current configuration and we're
stable so at this point again not
monitoring temperature a user might
say you know this is pretty good let's
see if we can push up to 15 50 megahertz
and get that stable I've seen all these
reviewers GN included hit 1600 or 1650
maybe I can do that so let's give that a
shot I just heard the heard the coil
line stopped on the motherboard which
indicates a crash
so there's actually some slight coil
wine from it running the settings we
have and it stopped and now we've
crashed so we need to increase the
voltage which is the first step to going
into an out-of-control scenario alright
so we're back let's uh let's just push
it up to one point to from one point one
seven five we're kind of getting to the
top end of what's comfortable here and
we'll talk about the safe voltages for
SOC and a separate content piece because
there are definitely unsafe voltages
especially depending on motherboard and
LLC and everything LLC tables but
that'll be a separate piece more or less
branded as how to kill your IMC or how
to kill your integrated memory
controller so keep an eye out for that
but anyway pushing up to 1.2 ap graphics
voltage which on this particular board
does seem to actually do something so we
took some time to stabilize the slightly
higher overclock 1550 megahertz and 1.2
for the AP graphics voltage 1.15 SOC
which hardware info not not a DMM but
harder infos times one just crashed okay
so there we go
this time it didn't blue screen so we're
getting closer it's just you know what
let's let's increase this you really
should not go beyond like 1.2 for an for
SOC voltage you might hear that 1.3 is
okay like AMD has said that I believe so
the thin is there's a difference between
typing 1.3 here and getting 1.3 into the
CPU and that difference on boards that
are more aggressive on voltage could be
deadly so if you type in 1.3 and you're
sending 1.4 into it that's very bad but
you know let's let's just increase SOC
voltage a bit talk it's all the same
honestly let's do that see if we can
stabilize
the go into BIOS I feel like it's
actually in BIOS right now if I know how
you can tell you NIT f10 and then I
could hit enter yeah it's in BIOS it's
going to BIOS it's not sending display
out you just throw it back over there
literally throw it so you'll notice in a
minute that our monitor changed that's
because the piece of pixie or
monitor that I have which I really
really dislike for a lot of reasons that
monitor wasn't giving us display in BIOS
and also they have scaler issues so
after wasting like an hour of our time
tonight every place the monitor and that
I do not recommend that particular pixel
monitor although I'm sure they make one
or two things that are actually good
that is not one of them so let's get
back to doing things the way I actually
wanted to do BIOS now that it works what
okay that's CPU polish okay
now we're pushing high voltages this is
kind of get into danger territory
especially on this motherboard so let's
pull back a little bit this because I
made adjustments in BIOS now let's just
see if like one point two four is stable
something like that should be it's
getting awfully close to the limits of
what we would recommend for SOC voltage
I'd recommend if I possible stop in 1.2
1.25 somewhere in there so we are
pushing 1600 megahertz now we're gonna
wait a minute for the MOSFETs to warm up
but I do mean almost literally one
minute because that's how long it will
take to get to ninety degrees we're at
82 already 83 this isn't the most
scientific way to take a measurement
it's just an infrared like it's just a
laser so problem with this is things
like emissivity and reflection we've
talked about in the past but I'm just
measuring something that's a blackbody
component so that's actually fine for
this thermos or our chokes which I'm not
actively measuring all right like 80 our
MOSFETs there we go 94 degrees that's
what we want to see 95 is climbing okay
there's a ha well we'll get to that
later
maybe okay so to recap we are beginning
to enter thermal runaway scenario we're
getting close a reminder of what we're
doing here there's no air flow on the
MOSFET they have no heat sink and even
if they had a bad one it would be
irrelevant because even with a bad
garbage heat sink if there's no air flow
over the heat sink then it doesn't
matter
because if if all you're doing is
soaking the heat but you can't get rid
of it all it's doing is like delaying
how long it takes to get into a
dangerous territory 99 degrees now so
again we'll see these things might
throttle some of them throttle it like
110 what happens frequency dials back
voltage drops and it'll spike both of
those numbers will spike up and down as
they throttle the control I think I've
pushed these to 120 already pre-film
and then I stopped or actually it was
technically 117 so we're gonna see if we
can go a little higher than that this
time and cause like a catastrophic
failure
we are stable at 1600 megahertz
I was sent degrees not there yet going
for it and this one with an SOC voltage
of about one point two three so again
this is a completely possible scenario
where someone's like I'm stable at 1600
and you won't see any signs of it being
unhealthy for the vrm to run at this
temperature until something goes
terribly wrong
and if you push the SOC voltage too high
the opposite problem occurs where if you
push out the C voltage too high you can
just slowly degrade the IMC to a point
where you'll have to dial back your
overclock or increase your voltage to
maintain the same overclock and worst
case scenario you might kill it if you
really really push like like say one
point four volts you kind of degraded
over time for SOC voltage and not not
that much time either one point five
kills things but yeah we're pretty
stable now 104 degrees not even really
trying I mean this is all completely
reasonable and so about the motherboard
part of this blame kind of goes it's
hard to blame Asus here too much because
this is not a board that they're
marketing at overclocking and this just
gets into territory where like if you're
buying this kind of motherboard and
you're overclocking it's kind of falling
onto your own shoulders there's a reason
that warranties are void with with
overclocking often so I don't know that
I really fully blame a soos because not
having erm heatsink certainly I would
prefer that they have erm heat sinks but
you could run this processor stock and
the vrm is not gonna overheat so if
their goal is to provide a cheap
motherboard that you can plug a CPU into
and let it go they've done that
obviously they're not marketing it for
overclocking and if they were that would
be a serious problem because it's not
good for that with no vrm heatsink but
we are at 107 degrees and climbing quite
rapidly you're starting to get into like
runaway scenario with the I don't I need
like any like a black sticker on one of
the caps actually there's a black corner
on it so all the other black body
components around the - I've probes are
slightly lower because pretty determined
that those were the hot spots 107 108
let's push this up to 16 50 megahertz
and see if we can get stability on it
overclocking only goes into increments
of 50 megahertz by the way so we crashed
so that means I need to increase the
voltage a bit
that's a 1.3 okay so here you go this is
where again depend on which vendor you
ask and we'll talk about this a lot in
our other killing your IMC video some
vendors will tell you one point three is
okay one point three once again to
repeat if we're saying one point three
is okay it's important to know is that
when I type in the number one point
three or when I measure the back of the
socket with a multimeter and see one
point three which one of those is
acceptable is probably the latter
so either way hardware info when we're
actually running an application thinks
about one point two eight after
resistances and things we might be a bit
higher than that and I've configured it
to one point one SOC well no actually
it's one point two this is wrong
BIOS has it at one point two and a bit
over one point two for AP graphics
voltage will see that stable and this is
going for 1650
Hertz CP is still under 51 degrees
Celsius so you would have no indication
at this point that something's wrong 116
degrees okay well we were away for a
minute getting everything set up so this
is with an SOC voltage of about 1.2 nine
to 1.3 this is where depending which
manufacturer you talk to you they might
say this is actually a safe voltage to
hold but they would probably suggest not
to go beyond this we're pushing that
down it's oh it's actually slowing down
it's not crashed we're pushing we were
pushing nine hours we just went down to
two right when I took that measurement
no it's back okay maybe that was a
throttle that might have been a throttle
on the PRM so we're back to pushing nine
amps if you want to do the math that's
nine times twelve point three to get the
watts which is 111 so we're pushing like
30 watts more than we were previously
into the EPS 12 volt rail or down it and
117 see if it throttles again at the
same yeah so it's throttling when this
reads 118 which might suggest that the
vrm is trying to prevent catastrophic
failure so that noise I just took a
recording of is coil whine and every
time it stops we know that it's
throttling let's see if it does it again
it'll be out like 118 should be around
here if it does throttle yeah it's
getting a little higher each time Oh
hit 120 this time
starting to get towards runaway what
kind of power are we pushing down into
this poor motherboard it's actually less
power it does smell like maybe the tape
the thermal tape I'm using might be
starting to burn 123 degrees mm-hmm SOC
voltage still saying about 1.3 so you're
following the guidance from vendors
who've said 1.3 then you're still within
guidance and you think about this if you
don't have a probe on it and you don't
know any better that a vrm can even like
that it even exists or that it can
overheat you look at your CPU
temperature like man 53 degrees that's
really good and I have a 16 50 megahertz
overclock stable and everything's
looking pretty good on the screen it's
not even slowing down anymore because I
increase the voltage enough 130 degrees
people from the thermocouples this is a
real thing that can happen in use cases
where you have no air flow so MOSFET one
130 mosfet to 128 TDI only 54 degrees
SOC voltage 1.28 to 1.3 133 oh gotta
shut down so we might have just had an
over temperature protection shut down
oil wine stopped everything's hot
welcome to hell alright so fire strike I
think corrupted itself in that crash so
we're just using fur mark now which is a
power virus for VRMs basically so eighty
degrees I'm gonna demonstrate one more
thing here I don't know that we'll get a
pop tonight because it looks like
there's an over temperature protection
to force a shutdown doesn't mean it'll
protect you from degradation or anything
but it will shut down the system so what
I'm gonna do is take a capacitor
measurement before we finish and see
what temperature those running at and
how quickly would they die although
they're not as choked out for air flow
as they could be there we go 100 degrees
already that's quick so alright so I've
jammed the capacitor in there it's not
exactly where I want it but it's decent
this number is what we're looking at can
you read that
sorry MOSFETs at 100 14.4 our capacitor
is currently at 94 and rising so here's
the thing if you're able to get
everything let's say you don't get a
thermal runaway scenario at 130 degrees
like we just did where it shuts down at
136 external temperature is probably 150
internally thermal shutdown to protect
you let's say you're sitting in stead of
something like 120 where there's no
thermal shutdown and things look
actually okay in Windows so at this
point you'd say you know what I'm
operating within spec and there's no
visual issue there's no artifact and
there's no crashing there's no actually
the coil mines pretty much gone away you
might think that this is actually okay
it looks stable but our capacitor is
rapidly approaching 100 105 degree
marker we're at 97 now and that's
without even being an internal reading I
that's an external probe and I'm not
even really happy with where I've
positioned it so I think it would be
worse in reality potentially so where we
are right now is with just fur mark we
were we were hitting 130 plus which 550
internal because that's that just
happens to be a magic trick point so
say where let's call it 140 heading 140
on the mas but I was measuring primarily
we currently have one capacitor at 91
degrees and this is a completely stable
overclock the framerate is not dropping
any more we don't really have coil whine
anymore and we're at 1650 megahertz and
things look fine
so what isn't fine in fact is that we're
at 91 degrees externally for the
capacitor we already know that the Delta
between external and internal can be
quite large because we were reading like
135 136 and we had a thermal shutdown at
that temperature for the MOSFET that's
not really a normal thermal shutdown
temperature 136 internally it was
probably 150 and you can look up the
datasheet I'm sure and get the exact
number but either way we've got at least
10 degrees of headroom there which puts
us pretty close to 105 this is in open
air if I put this in a bit Phoenix and
so and that's the GoPro if I put that in
a bit Phoenix and so or some other
closed-off case it really wouldn't be
hard to get the extra 5 degrees if we're
already at a hundred plus and this is
with not perfectly accurate external
measurements anyway so what I'm saying
is although we're apparently not going
to get a catastrophic pop today because
there is in fact a an over temperature
protection what will happen is in about
maybe five thousand hours of use in this
condition your motherboard could
potentially blow a capacitor and if it
doesn't cool you're lucky but it will
eventually and that's kind of the that's
the problem that's where if you're
overclocking on a platform like this
it's not really meant for it a lot of be
350 platforms or like this one even
though they have fake garbage heat sinks
on I mean like literally basically
plastic hunt some of them like the top
of the heat sink is plastic so when I
say fake I mean actually it's it's a
fake heat sink in fact so they have bad
heat sinks on them and you're running in
these conditions you can blow a
capacitor
and and it will take a while so this is
this kind of response like anyone who
thinks they're doing fine on a closed
off airflow case with a cheap
motherboard as bad vrm or bad vir I'm
cooling and they think that they're okay
because you're fine today but see how it
isn't a year of that kind of use maybe
one and a half years depends on how much
you gave under those conditions or
whatever you're doing so yeah I think we
can we can stop this one here but
basically we didn't get a catastrophic
failure which I really wanted because
it'd be cool on camera but the board has
some kind of over temperature protection
and the MOSFETs but you still got to see
the whole process and you got to see
something hit 136 degrees which is
pretty damn cool for a computer
component well actually it's the literal
opposite of cool you know what I'm
saying so yeah it's just kind of a fun
workshop basically there wasn't a whole
lot of point to this except hopefully
there was some stuff I said in between
the beginning and now that gave you
something you can take home and learn
from even though we didn't get it cool
like catastrophic flame out from it but
if we left this set up for a while it
would eventually degrade and or die
depend on if the IMC takes the damage or
if the capacitor takes the damage first
so yeah that's it as I said no major
conclusion here or at least not like a
bombastic one but just kind of workshop
it from beginning to end for fun with
high temperature stuff so subscribe if
