of ask GN this one's got a pretty fun
opening question about something I T is
the last weekend since then has been
fully revealed by other rumor mills on
the internet so we talked about Nvidia's
naming scheme shortly and other than
that if you have questions leave them in
the comment section below as always
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by the EVGA sleeves wire
combs people often ask me what my hair
care routine is and it's the same as any
self-respecting enthusiasts cable
management routine I use the EVGA
sleeved wire combs to neatly organize
each individual strand of hair just like
how they can tidy up individual cable
wires in your system the cable comb kit
includes two 24 pin to 8 pin 4 PCIe and
a couple of peripheral sleeved wire
combs learn more at the link in the
description below so getting into this
one first of all like last time we're
gonna have an extended edition for the
patreon backers I'll be talking about
that more in a moment the first question
was it from mr. scat os-- Klauss who
said whoa hold on there second tech
Jesus what do you know about ampere
Volta and the name scheme of Nvidia
next-gen GPUs speak up spit it out we
were on to you you know you are hiding
something come on be a good lad chop
chop very demanding there so yeah last
episode someone asked about something
about ampere and I said I don't think
that's actually what it's called I left
it there so this is where it gets kind
of fun this is the whole touring thing
you've probably seen it by now
that's the rumored name rather than the
one that's been rumored and actually a
couple months ago I put out a content
piece where we started actually couple
content pieces where we started burying
references to the actual naming scheme
because I'd heard about it through a
couple of vendors we didn't want to go
and publish like a hey here's the actual
name of the next-gen and video
architecture thing and because I don't
know didn't really seem like the right
thing to do so
we just kind of buried references to it
and I know that at least one board
vendor caught it because they messaged
me about it I don't think anyone else
did which is part of the fun because the
Turing test so so yeah here's the thing
here's a quote from a Content piece we
put out with the what do manufacturers
think of mining six months later this is
the second one I dropped where I said
the primary concern from aiv partners is
that they'll be left with overstock and
with new architectures looming no
torre√≥n tests needed for that it's
likely that those cards would remain on
the shell of ass blah blah blah you get
the idea so that was I think the second
instance of hiding something related to
Torian and our content as a test for
anyone who might have an idea that the
name was different
so yeah in fact we didn't know that and
it is supposed to be the name for the
next-gen gaming architecture as I
understand it today that might change I
was told this by people in the industry
some months ago now and things could
have changed in that time or they could
have been wrong or whatever but related
to the recent rumor mill content I would
say that yes the idea of that being the
name of the architecture is probably
correct I haven't actually read any of
the rumor mill stuff beyond the name so
I don't know what they've been saying
about GTX 2000-series or any of that
stuff I have no idea I haven't read it
any of that that you would be interested
in on a hardware specification side
generally avoid rumors and reading them
outside of reading the headlines just to
kind of know what people are gonna be
talking about that week so yeah that's a
that's the fun part there which thoria
is not even exposing that now is because
rumors popped up like right after we
posted that content piece people other
web sites figured it out whether through
their own sources or otherwise so yeah
next one is a little bit less fun of a
topic it's just gonna be me complaining
for a second this is from Golden Sun
three D s and two other or three other
people posted similar comments to this
one and it said patreon exclusive
content that is a low this is referring
to last week when we said with every SPN
we're now going to take some of the
extra questions
from the patreon backers from patreon
discord from people who give us money
and address those in a second episode
that's maybe 10 minutes long and put it
out just for patreon backers and it was
exclusive content for them it's not
early access or anything like that we
already do this with behind the scenes
videos
it's low-quality production admittedly
it's generally low-quality content but
it's just some kind of interesting stuff
to show the people who support us
directly hey this is what we're working
on you might be interested in it we're
not going to invest a lot of time trying
to produce it because the point is to
not reduce the amount of content we're
putting out on this channel on the main
one so here's the thing this is not us
taking away content from the main
channel in fact it's doing more work
we've added a video production slot to
the schedule so it's it's increasing our
workload as viewers you don't get less
patreon backers get more everyone else
gets all the same stuff as before and
we're just giving patreon backers a less
formal ask GN with their questions and a
behind-the-scenes video every now and
then just for kind of like hey here's
some cell phone footage stuff of things
were working on just in case you thought
it would be cool so that's kind of what
that is I was pretty disappointed to see
this contest this comment come out of
anyone in our audience the why aren't
you giving this to us for free to
comment because it seems like our
audience should kind of know better than
that understand beans we're again not
taking stuff away we're adding stuff and
like I guess the main thing here is
we're not doing the early access content
a cage note behind-the-scenes videos but
it's not like we're holding real content
with benchmarks or motherboard reviews
or whatever we're not doing exclusive
content for core motherboard video card
CPU none of that is behind a paywall
and I have no plans for it to be so
nothing's really changed I would say
that if you have that concern ask
yourself
gamers Nexus makes mod mattes and shirts
and stickers they don't give that to me
for free
why am I upset that this extra ask Jen
isn't given to me for free but I'm not
upset that the shirts and the stickers
aren't given to me for free where's the
difference because I can tell you what I
think the difference is I think people
see a physical product like a shirt or a
mat or mug and they have this intrinsic
understanding that that thing cost me
money to make so no I will not give it
to you for free
well videos cost money to make - I've
got staff and equipment costs and
operating costs so it's really no
different than physical product now we
run ads on those videos and we have
means to make the money back obviously
otherwise you wouldn't operate but the
point is ultimately patreon backers are
footing a now somewhat significant
portion of operating costs and we want
to give them something as a thank you
and that something was one to two
behind-the-scenes videos a month and now
an extra ask Jen with just their
questions and it's kind of informal very
direct with the patreon backers and
about 10 minutes long so it's just it's
a way to say how can we give them
something more without taking away from
the main content and we said you know
what an extra ask Jen doesn't take that
much more time just add another hour or
two of work a week and that's that's the
end of it pretty easy so yeah that's
that's what I have to say about that you
know when you're working 100 plus hours
a week all the time physically there is
no more time left so it's it's just like
it's a little bit more but it's not
crazy and I wouldn't make any in-depth
content exclusively for patreon because
just the physical limitations of time
and space wouldn't allow it
so next real question Caudill is said
this one was on discord said Steve so I
know this would be pretty niche but have
you guys considered testing with closed
loop liquid coolers which ones have the
best radiator or pump performance ie
using the same best performing fans on
all the radiators say maybe the NOC -
industrial fans I think the gist of this
question is basically if I put
if I take the same to high-end fans put
them on all the liquid coolers where's
the difference so I have thought about
it and it is interesting we've done some
stuff like this not a whole lot I've
only done this with maybe three coolers
where we normalize the fans generally
speaking the ASO tech coolers
particularly of the same generation even
kind of plus or minus one generation
they all perform about the same once you
normalize for the fans so let's say we
have three 280s on the table all made by
a Sutekh they're the most common
manufacturer anyway so you might have a
course here 280 an EVGA 280 and NZXT 280
there are very few differences between
them other than things like RGB lighting
NZXT has a custom PCB that they designed
that's all ten of software driven stuff
so the real difference is then come down
for a cooling test with normalized fans
would come down to radiator cold plate
microphone density and pitch and that's
tube length I guess that would impacted
a bit so there's not a lot of difference
because the manufacturer does have a
decent out of control over the process
however most of that control is either
aesthetic or it's some convenience
oriented thing like tube length and
that's not going to change a whole lot
for performance the tube type doesn't
change between ACE tech coolers the cold
plate doesn't change between ace tech
coolers I don't think if it does it's
exceptionally minor because I haven't
been able to notice it i've opened all
of them and yeah i mean it's it's the
fans comes down to the fans
so that's you're eliminating the main
difference for them now if we look
outside of these tech coolers that's
where you would probably start to see
pump differences so pump speed can
impact that it's true that some a tech
coolers run at different speeds if
you're on one low and one high yes there
would be a difference but you can pretty
much run them all at the same speeds at
this point they all have some level of
pump control for the most part so yeah
differences would be if you move from
ASA Tech as the supplier to someone like
Dyna Tron or a pol tech or any of them
so like a pol tech makes for example the
old Silverstone tundra coolers and I
can't remember who else they make these
that I have a list of it on the web
site but those would be the differences
and no I haven't done it it would be
interesting but I think if I did that
test I there's a couple other things I'd
want to do as well so it'd get kind of
we'd make it a bit more complex I don't
know if we'll get to that though but
honestly I guess step back and look at
what you want to buy and if everything
you want find out who the suppliers are
if everything you want to buy as many
buy A's attack then I would say don't
really worry about it by the one that
looks the best and fits your computer
and and they should all basically
perform the same with the same fans and
outside of that I'll let you know if
then when I find out next one Zeta said
Steve what makes for a good mousing
surface I've heard there are certain
materials or prints that are detrimental
to sensor performance particularly in
very fast or very precise movements and
I have a separate sheet on that so I
took this question I emailed it to
Logitech's thought it was a an
interesting one so here's what logitech
said they answered a few my questions
they started out by just saying it's
hard to find bad mouse pads now in
general and in large part because the
newer generations of sensors have been
designed part to track well on surfaces
gamers decide they want to play on
mostly black cloth so my first question
to that was what specifically is it
about a surface that a mouse sensor is
looking for what does the mouse sensor
want to see is it contrast is it doing
like some kind of luma tree scope
analysis is it looking at is it doing
white balance does it CZ depth or grain
or weave or fabric things like that and
the first the easiest answer doesn't do
any limit Rhys cope analysis or white
balancing the answer I got was no as for
the rest logitech informed me that these
sent this is a quote the sensor works
largely using contrast as it detects
motion by comparing the features in
multiple images against each other
this makes illumination homogeneity
important as inconsistency in the light
could change the appearance of those
features the sensor doesn't see z-axis
changes but if the depth is large enough
it could be believed that the mouse has
been lifted
fortunately for game
this would be a terrible service to use
physically something like a cheese
grater so it's unlikely it would happen
in a real world scenario my next
questions that was about colors are
there any specific colors that would
confuse a sensor or patterns or things
like that do higher low contrasting
colors have any observable impact and
performance the answer was any color
that absorbs IR light around 850
nanometers wavelength rather than
reflecting it would be bad for sensors
too extreme contrast colors like black
and white that are exactly in the path
of travel when flickering at high speed
could reduce maximum tracking speed
similarly to the way that repetitive
patterns with 2 millimeter pitch could
do so at a very basic level this type of
service can make the sensor lose some
ability to correlate images with
certainty reducing performance so to
really reduce performance there's a lot
of specific things that need to happen
I asked about wood fabric with a denser
versus looser weave have an impact on
tracking capabilities while detects are
definitely yes the weave of the fabric
is such that it acts like a repetitive
pattern or interferes with the
homogeneity of the illumination and it
can mess with tracking and then finally
any other notes on what specifically
makes a bad-mouthing service this one's
kind of an obvious answer but clean
glass and mirrors of course and then
repetitive patterns so hopefully that
answers your question pretty interesting
stuff and not something you think about
a lot next question is from Bill when
Bill when cello who says I have a
motherboard that won't boot and I'm
trying to diagnose it what's the first
thing you guys have checked there's a
question we answered ages ago but I
wanted to bring it back because it is a
good one to touch up on so we have a
guide somewhere on the website of basic
troubleshooting steps some of the first
stuff I would do off the top my head in
that scenario in order of what's easiest
to do would be reseat the RAM boot bare
bones so that would be like do all these
one at a time so you can actually
identify the issue rather than just fix
it or not know but bare bones probably
first so anything that's not needed
disconnect it make it simple
if you installed the motherboard without
standoffs or you dropped the screw there
could be a direct short that would
definitely cause it's not boot if the
board is contacting the steel of the
case rather than a standoff then it that
would be a short that would be your
problem after that kind of stuff is
accounted for and you've gone bare-bones
go down to one stick a memory tried in
two different or three different slots
and see if it's a memory slot issue or a
memory stick issue if it doesn't work
try the other stick if available if
that's clearly not the problem
I would probably move next to reseeding
the video card or going IGP if you can
if there is an IGP in the cpu next I
would probably reset CMOS some boards
have a button to do this the I prefer
still to remove the CMOS battery the
silver battery and technically you
should be able to leave it out for like
15 seconds and it will clear I have had
boards that will keep memory forever
like minutes so if you really want to
just pull it out walk away for five
minutes get a drink and come back that
probably get you through most of the
issues make sure the EPS 12 volt cables
plugged in that would cause it to spin
up and then instantly turn off it's
really easy to overlook seating of all
the components seating all the cables
again make sure they are seated properly
in the power supply that's that's most
what I got if it really comes down to it
you could receipt the CPU this is a
possibility that you have a bent pin
either in the socket or the CPU
depending or a missing pin if it's AMD
it's more likely missing than bent you
can look into the socket and see if
there's any gold shining through that's
missing pin sometimes you can still boot
without them Intel you might have to
unbend pins I think that basically
covers everything there's a lot more you
can do obviously computers are complex
but those are all my first
troubleshooting steps beyond there
you're looking at going to forums for
getting one-on-one help from someone
okay so next one David five days ago do
you get recognized in public do people
want your signature or take a picture or
something of the likes
the only instance of this I would like
to bring up and remind everyone of is
what caused the NZXT to create the shirt
pocket gamers Nexus and hopefully we can
dig up the the source video for this and
let it play for a second
but that was someone we work with in the
industry in Taiwan who who saw me and
recognized me I didn't know who it was
till we got to the top of the escalator
in that shot but he saw me went by and
just said you know IRA's Nexus like
I mean this isn't everyone around you
speaks Chinese not speaking English so
just saying hi would be enough but no
that got my attention that was being
recognized in public by someone with
whom I work so not really that special
that's probably the only real instance
of that
I'll get recognized at trade shows where
the entire audience and everyone in the
convention center either works there and
with us or maybe at like pax is a
consumer we got we got this a couple
times at the Corsair booth last year
where you got the Corsair booth so it's
people who like hardware got recognized
a couple times but it's not that common
so not really I mean at trade shows yeah
definitely
and feel free to say hi but yeah not not
all that common I'm not I don't work
with celebrities like Jay I think he
gets recognized more next one Cyrus are
I followed your MacGyver type hybrid
1080 hybrid cooler on a 1080i EFI guide
I had one immediately available and now
I'm worried about RAM on the furthest
end next to the waterblock
that area really heats up and gets no
airflow so I can't speak specifically to
your configuration without seeing a
photo of it however we later tested
after that guide we did a Titan xp1
hybrid mod and we tested what's the
temperature of the vram and of the vrm
because without the blower fan the
question was are they still getting
enough airflow the answer was yes
neither was anywhere close to the max
spec they were actually doing quite well
with just the base plate and whatever
airflow was kind of just naturally there
so I wouldn't worry too much about it
unless you have specific reasons to be
concerned as for the reference fan speed
if we talk about the blower fan on the
end of the card you can leave that at
like 25 to 40 percent and it'll be
sufficient it's not like it's contained
anymore so that should be sufficient if
you're really worried about it you could
find a way to spot check the
temperatures I would just like I guess
it comes down to a question of how hot
is it like it's hard to say without
thermocouples but open up gpu-z and make
sure the GPU temperature looks good
GPU temperature looks good and your base
plate is on you're probably fine and if
you're really concerned you can get a
separate case fan just blast it with
that and you'll be good if you start
seeing thin if you get like shutdowns or
artifacts then there might be an issue
but without seeing that I can tell you
more just do a couple more here
this one's quick prefix said Steve if I
donate $1,000 to patreon can I have a
shout-out to my twitch channel twitch.tv
slash Q marching no you can't don't give
me any money for that because I'm not
gonna do it next quit wait next question
is from Street guru it says maybe too
late if you get this one but with the
rise in AP use out will new egg or
others start advertising old rising
three and five bundles with the
motherboards that don't support Raven
Ridge out of the box is it something
people should be on the lookout for we
have a separate video on that we just
filmed before this so the answer is
pretty much in there but Andy and their
partners are putting stickers on the
boxes for physical retail for online
retail there's you you're not going to
know if there's a sticker on the box I
think they're doing some kind of
flashing kit and if that isn't help to
you then AMD has assured me that they're
partners in each region are responsible
for making sure that you actually can
get a board working so if it doesn't
work I think you have to email them New
Ager whomever and and they'll take it
back and get it flashed for you for free
I think and if that's not the case let
me know last one jazz Oh will says
question for SP and I was wondering am I
worrying too much about my
use temperatures I built a fan profile
around mining to keep the card under 60
degrees when gaming I noticed my fans
will ramp up immediately I try to keep
it under 60 for everything so it's about
59 I get 79% on the fans and get
normally to 100% fans on modern titles
with a 1080 Strix well you're going for
a pretty aggressive temperature 60 is is
definitely good and that'll get your
boost clocks higher it's like every five
CEO on Pascal gets me more boost so
that's that money a good place to be but
you don't have to be there I'd say let
it go a little higher you could run up
to maybe 70 75 you'll be fine it's not
gonna hurt it and your fans can quiet
down you'll lose some clock but not much
we're talking like in the dozens of
megahertz not in the hundreds of
megahertz so that would be my first step
second step is look at your case make
sure it has air flow and if it doesn't
then resolve that because that may be
your problem but without knowing more I
that's that's kind of the most I can say
so
Zeta last one said would you say that
the products on your store page are
objectively cooler than the
competition's offerings seen as they are
based in California for the most part
and we're not I would say that yes it is
objectively cooler here than it is there
and therefore our products are
objectively speaking and cooler then I
mean if we just took the out-of-the-box
thermals of them they would probably be
cooler but that's just kind of I mean
that's it just seems like basic science
to me I don't know unless their air
conditioning there's or something like
that that's it for this one again there
will be an extra patreon questions asked
en filmed after this it should go live
at the same time we'll set it to we'll
post it on the patreon page but
otherwise you can leave your questions
below for next time thank her asking
them and for watching go to
patreon.com/scishow gamers Nexus tell us
that directly go to store that gamers
Nexus not net to pick up one of our
other non free items that's discussed in
here and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
