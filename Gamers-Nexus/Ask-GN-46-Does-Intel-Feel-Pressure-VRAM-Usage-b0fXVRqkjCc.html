episode it's been a little while last
travel if you have questions for next
week's episode post them in the comments
below and we'll try to get them for that
video some of these are from our patreon
discord so if you don't see the
questions from the comments from the
last episode that's because they came
from our patreon backers on discord
because I needed some new questions
because the previous video is all rise
and stuff and we answered most that in
the reviews before getting to this
episode this coverage is brought to you
by EVGA and there FTW three icx card
which is a 1080 TI icx card meaning it
has the NTC thermistors attached all
over the board so you can get VR MVM
temperature readings and additional GPU
reading and stuff like that kind of cool
check out the link in the description
below for more information on that card
so based on my vague understanding of
what our upload schedule should be this
week in theory we already have content
up pertaining to this device here if
that is the case then this first
questions already answered which was
does the switch still work asked by many
people and the answer is yes for the
most part so it works well enough to do
the thermal testing we can play rather
the wild on it it functions basically as
expected there are a couple extra screws
that that were not extra when I took it
apart originally but I does it's in good
shape and you don't really need those
anyway apparently because it's held
together just fine
so yeah that's good to go first question
is from walter favor who says why are
modern games using more and more vram
the textures don't seem to look any
better and I believe added some extras I
have I used to have two 772 gigabyte
cards in SLI which I could play crysis 3
at 1080 ultra without getting bad
framerate and running out of VRAM I
currently have a 290x 4 gigabyte and I
now seem to be it slowly going out of
VRAM again why is that our game that I
came dev is just becoming more awful at
efficiently using vram that's always a
possibility but not not to slight devs
just because the development environment
is so insanely fast-paced this is why
directx12 and vulcan is taking so long
to get rolling because those low-level
api s are really not trivial to program
for which is a different question really
but but same idea where optimization is
not huh not an easy thing when you're
also trying to just make the game and
get it out the door but as for the the
kind of you ran requirement there's a
few things here the first thing to kind
of mention which i've done in the past
in previous episodes is a depending on
how you're measuring vram that number
you're seeing might be misleading so
there are a few ways to do this a couple
of games like GTA 5 was one of the first
we really praised for adding a VRAM bar
and their options many that was pretty
cool couple companies are doing that now
I think Ghost Recon wildlands included
and the division maybe that's that's one
way to look at V RAM consumption that is
going to be an estimate based on
whatever the developers have put in
there to ask to make consumption and
theory that should be pretty accurate
that's generally the maximum amount that
would be consumed now the other way the
more common way would be to take a tool
like gpu-z and just look at what it says
is being consumed for vram now the
misleading thing here is that all gpu-z
knows is how much vrm is more or less
being engaged not necessarily used just
requested access to by the applications
so an example would be I think call of
duty black ops 3 is the game that we've
tested a lot in the past that one will
look like it can consume 10 to 12 Giga
bytes of VRAM with the Titan X or
something in reality you'll be just fine
without that but that's just because
it's sitting there requesting all of it
it doesn't know if it's gonna use it or
not it's just saying hey give me all
that memory you have not necessarily
actually using the memory so depending
on the tools you're using the first part
of this question why are games using
more v-ray I might just be that they're
your cards have more vram and the tools
you're using to look at consumption are
saying that all of it's being used
because the games are just requesting
all of it not necessarily using it so
that's part one as far as actual usage
of VRAM I would say look at things like
consoles now we have
the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox one or
whatever it is right now whatever
iteration they're on 1 s I don't know
but we're the consoles are upwards of 8
gigabytes of memory at this point and
that means that the developers have some
more freedom to actually use more memory
on the consoles as they port these PC
maybe they don't optimize it as well or
maybe they are using more vram that
doesn't answer your why don't textures
seem to look better a question I think
that's more of a subjective thing but I
would say that consoles are one of the
first places to look just because if you
are building for the lowest common
denominator and that is now an 8
gigabyte memory device suddenly you can
use a whole lot more vram than
previously seems permissible and
considering your porting to maybe a PC
where the RAM is pretty high and Excel
vrm and memory because their system
memory too we don't have the same
limitation as consoles in that regard
you're gonna be able to build more
complex images and textures and things
like that but as for textures don't seem
to look any better I guess that probably
just depends on the game more than
anything because there are some games
that look legitimately really good but
yeah so they answer in short is a few
parts it's one how are you measuring it
if you're using tools that just say how
much vram is being requested then as you
upgrade video cards it will always look
like more V rounds being consumed which
you can test by running a game with a
card that has 4 gigabytes put another
one in that has 6 or 8 put another one
in that has more if you have access to
all those and you'll see that each time
with the right games or the wrong games
more and more will be requested even
though the game performance in terms of
memory consumption might be the same the
next question is from Joe Gibbs he says
hey GN a friend wants to build a new PC
on Rison he wants 32 gigabytes of RAM
and when asked why he says he wants it
to do graphic design I think he should
buy 16 and then maybe upgrade in the
future if he runs out do you think 16 is
still enough in 2017 and when should you
go for 32 gigabytes so the the most
immediate thing was the support graphic
design I'm not 100% sure what that means
depending on the software the first
thing I would do is say take the current
system and run the projects that you're
like a representative size of what
you'll be doing on a day to day basis
for us that might be something like
premier run in our case premier or
Photoshop or whatever open a project
file that would be representative maybe
get some chrome windows or whatever in
the background just to eat another
thousand gigabytes of memory that's what
chrome does and then look at your memory
consumption and from there figure out
what do I need for my tax bill that
would be step one step two Rison still
has some issues with supporting four
sticks of memory in theory that should
be kind of worked out going forward I'm
not 100% sure the details on it right
now there are more and more efi updates
coming from all the board vendors that
for the most part almost well really
like 100% of them right now our
addressing memory issue is memory clock
or memory capacity or whatever in theory
that support gets better
so first first thing to do see how much
memory is being used currently once
you've kind of plotted that against some
common use cases then look at the
options for Rison if you need 32
gigabytes keep in mind that generally
speaking more sticks of memory in some
of the existing Rison platforms may mean
that you run at a lower clock rate if
that is acceptable for the most cases
well I guess it depends on what you're
doing but for the most case it probably
is if you really just care about
capacity and not speed then go for it
but if not I would say just do some some
research on the platforms out there the
crosshair 6 has gotten better and better
almost on a weekly basis they're like I
mean they're pushing beta update to us
every couple days for EFI or for BIOS if
you prefer and that is generally
improving memory support and the same is
true for the gigabyte gaming 5 board but
yeah some boards still have issues with
4/6 memory rising as a platform in
general has some issues with memory
again in general so make sure you do you
research the kits you buy may not
actually clock to they're advertised
rate on the kit depending on again
motherboard efi chip and use all kinds
of stuff and you can check tries and
review
hours included and a couple others as
well legit reviews as a good memory
discussion you can check those from our
information well the short answer thirty
two gigabytes you can totally use in the
right use cases we blow through that in
some of our projects with a lot of warp
stabilizes or sped up time lapse type
things so it may be worthwhile the next
question is from Street guru who posted
this in our patreon discord again
patreon.com slash K person axis if you
want to get in on that Street guru asks
also going to guess you'll have a rise
and overclocking guide at some point
perhaps bring in build to chat about it
yes that is the plan I've been talking
with builds worried about that he's
waiting for your motherboard still
Verizon and he's on another continent
it's not easy for us to share parts with
them it's also very expensive to get
them there so he should have a board at
some point it's just a matter of when
they become available in that region and
we're hoping to contract them to help us
out with an overclocking guy that's a
bit more in-depth than you might
normally get so that is in the plans yes
next question
Steve Strazza also from discord asks why
is vram a fixed component on the GPU not
user replaceable in parentheses as
opposed to CPU Ram which is standardized
and replaceable I would say probably the
most answer to that is going to be
latency or size V Ram is soldered its
BGA is it's got a hundred and something
hundred seventy pins maybe or hundred
seventy solder points so the ball grid
array it allows the memory to take less
of a footprint on the PCB if that's item
number one that's really important so
being smaller you can pack it in denser
which is important for a GPU where you
don't have a full motherboard size
available to you also the latency is a
lot better on something like gddr5
versus ddr4 three that's really
important for a video card where you're
really trying to avoid ever talking to
system memory if possible you want to
store as much game content as possible
into the local memory that's because the
latency is lower which is because it is
that BGA gddr5 architecture has a
to standard ddr4 that you put in a
system their system memory in general so
that's the main part the size would
probably be the other one because if you
can think about it
putting on Ram sized slots that socket
onto something like this is not very
size friendly you could do it with I
guess something like laptop Timms but
that's that's kind of how I read into
that question that's the basics of it I
don't I don't know that I have a more
in-depth explanation for you a next
question
Dana of Starfall also Dischord said
question for ask GN how much of a
quality difference is there in general
between motherboard manufacturers and
where is the difference the biggest
sometimes it seems like all of the
motherboards are exactly the same yeah
so I I remember feeling the same way a
long time ago
and in some regard they are very similar
this is especially true as the CPUs have
continued to pull things off of the
board and put them on to the CPU in the
past that'll be the memory controller
that IMC and then briefly it's kind of
nebulous what's going on lately but
briefly a fiber it didn't completely
remove the vrm from the board you still
needed it on the board but having five
around the chip did complicate some
things in some ways and did remove some
of the customization in some ways from
the board vendors so what happens well
they can customize in a few things one
is component quality that's the biggest
one so just where do the caps come from
where do the chokes come from who's
making them are they any good so you can
buy the cheapest FETs in China stick
them on a board and it's not gonna
overclock as well even if it has a ton
of phases just because the fats aren't
very good quality so that's that's
important is how good are the components
the individual pieces on the board the
next thing is stuff like I standard
stuff like IO that's of course a
differentiating factor it's not that
exciting of one because not hard to
change how many SATA ports are on it or
how many USB ports are on it
that's more or less a PCH or chipset
level thing and then you just assign the
lanes to the device that you want as the
board
so that's one way but more importantly
it's stuff like component quality the
vrm design if you are buying something
like for example a be 350 motherboard
and you want to do a big overclock you
really need to make sure that vrm is
good because as I was speaking with
build Zoid there are a couple boards out
there where pushing a heavier overclock
through a vrm that's simpler lower
quality components is just going to
generate a ton of heat and won't be as
stable you might not be able to get as
far but definitely generate more heat
than on something like an X 370
counterpart in the am for world where
you might have better components or just
more phases and better component stuff
like that other things would be small
features that's how they differentiate
themselves these days so that's stuff
like software normally I don't like
motherboard software but with Rison AI
suite was actually really useful because
the temperatures were very difficult to
figure out in at least in the early days
a bit different now still in the early
days but not as early as then so
motherboard software RGB lighting if you
care about that that's a differentiating
point but really again the the big
things we've kind of gone over so short
answer yes they are pretty similar these
days but they still differentiate
themselves so hopefully you can find
something out there that suits the needs
based on price next question is oh
that's right I had a note here EFI
quality and options available also
matters a lot with motherboards
because BIOS is where everything happens
at a user level so hopefully it's a good
EFI and also audio hardware that's one
thing that they still have a lot of
control over so if you really care about
audio and you don't want to sound card
consider that to mr. Derek has the next
question asks for perhaps as a GN
question do you foresee Intel becoming
much cheaper in future as a result of
Rison specifically with x99 or $1.99
lineup that is so I think I think you're
looking at the right place I would I
would guess that Intel there's a greater
chance of them modifying their
extreme series x99 type or x99 beyond
products in terms of price or stack
positioning than their sort of z series
enthusiast grade products because just
in terms of competition andy is
competing most heavily with intel in
that x99 class or whatever's beyond that
so that would be where I would expect
price changes like the one thousand
dollar sixty nine hundred K might drop
that would be where I would expect to
see it or more likely whatever comes
after the sixty nine hundred K its
replacement because I don't know that
they'll change the price this late in
the lifespan other than maybe fifty
dollar rebates or something but I would
not expect to see a huge change today
and something like a Z series ready
processor like a 7700 K that seems to be
pretty happy where it is and generally
that's about three hundred thirty three
hundred forty dollars somewhere in there
now as for what r5 will do that remains
to be seen depends on how competitive
are five is in its class as I said on t
DW I was on Joker's show hours before
recording this as I said on his show the
are fives based on the specs and what we
know about the are sevens really will
will will tear the i-5 is a new one for
things like production for blender or
premiere if you do it on the CPU and
your alternative is an i-5 then the r5
is in theory you wait for us to test it
before you buy anything in theory should
be a whole lot better in terms of gaming
that's a different story
we'll see I I'm not gonna speculate on
that right now I kind of did on his show
but in terms of gaming different story
so it depends on what Intel's targeting
at the in the x9 class those are really
not good for gaming when you look at the
price the value is very bad for a sixty
nine hundred K thousand dollar CPU
you're getting basically seventy seven
hundred K performance plus or minus
depending on if the game cares but I see
your clock rate or core count or
whatever so those are bad value so in
that way if it's a gaming targeted
processor like a 7700 K I don't think
Intel will really care that much right
now but something like a production
processor like the sixty nine hundred K
that
where it makes a whole lot more sense
for Intel to change its pricing or its
strategy for marketing or its next line
up most likely like X 199 or whatever
they call it that's where I think we'll
see the changes so hopefully that
answers that question that's all
speculation but that's hopefully
somewhat educated speculation last
question is from Donald G who said any
chance that we can get a chart showing
your cat's a base speed versus
overclocked on catnip maybe uh maybe
Andrew can drop one of those charts in
or something so you'll have you'll have
that information for the future if you
need it so thank you for watching as
