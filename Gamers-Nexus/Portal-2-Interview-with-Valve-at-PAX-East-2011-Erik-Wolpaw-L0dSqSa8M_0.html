tonight and we were going to be talking
with Eric from Portal Eric can you tell
me why the two robots were chosen for
co-op well the big reason was even
though portals kind of absurd funny game
there still is a seriousness about dying
in the single-player game that when you
die you're really dead I mean there is
some steak so obviously you can reload
but in the fiction you die and you're
dead
co-op you die over and over again and
you just come back because you know your
partner's still alive so if we had made
them people that we thought it would
take away from the seriousness of death
in the single-player also it would just
be kind of gruesome whereas the robots
we can explode and crush and destroy in
a bunch of different ways and it's it's
just funny rather than being disturbing
well competitive mode ever see the light
of day not the one we originally worked
on maybe some day some kind of
competitive mode that's fun you know
somebody will have some brainstorm for
that but not in the form where we you
know originally messed around with it is
there any any openness for modding I
last portal had a lot of support for
modding indirectly and there was some
pretty good like portal pre loot was a
good mod for it well the support for
mods will be you know at least the same
as it was in portal 1 and you know we'll
see what happens
going down can you tell me about some of
the engine changes for portal 2 if any
what we've you know source keeps
changing you know we're always working
on it so since portal 1 shipped we ship
left 4 dead 1 left 4 dead 2 so all the
changes we made in left 4 dead 1 left 4
dead 2 which is a bunch of lighting
changes various optimizations one thing
that you see in Portal 2 there's a big
one is this sort of blob technology that
we use for the pain
which be hard to describe other than
blob since I'm not an engineer I don't
know the actual terms for it but all the
improvements we've made in the you know
three years since portal one came out or
incorporated in portal 2 how about the
game's pace so when we were watching the
trailers it looked like multiplayer like
co-op was a lot faster paced and that
might just be the trailers but has the
pace of the game changed at all since
the first one what by pacing I'm not
sure with what part of pacing just just
the speed at which you complete tasks oh
you know no part of that is the the
trailers themselves so you make a
trailer you know to get people excited
and if you show people slowly
deliberating over a puzzle it doesn't
make the world's most exciting trailer
so the trailers are kind of our most
ninja staff members you know cut
together in an exciting way the game is
still you know just like portal one it's
a gradual training art it's not any more
difficult than portal 1 it's simply
there's more options for puzzle solving
but yeah in terms of pacing it's it's
not faster paced okay
we saw it so the gels you've already
said a little bit about the gels
we saw blue gels and orange so far in
that trailer are there any other ones
that we might not know about yes can you
say what those are no if I give you cake
will you say what those are no okay so
we saw you guys sucked up a student
project that was this to Japan which was
a tag the power paint we saw it
you know he's got really smart guys we
talked to him we liked the tag project
and so we hired him and at some point
after we hired him you know we came to
the realization that the paint mechanic
worked really well with the portal gun
mechanic and so we incorporated it into
portal 2 very cool
last last two questions I think can you
tell me just out of my own curiosity
I was reading on on the portal 2 wiki it
looks like you guys did a lot of play
testing obviously to make sure the
puzzles aren't too hard or too easy have
you hired any of the people who uploaded
speedrun videos on YouTube just not not
that I know of there's a lot of people
working to valve no but although I do
respect that guy who did it in ten
minutes that was a fairly insane
speedrun last question from now well
actually let's do two more what is your
personal favorite part about portal 2
that you're looking forward to well my
personal favorite part is I couldn't
tell you till after we ship because it's
a spoiler but probably the co-op mode is
is pretty amazing the way you don't
think that adding an extra set of
portals would change the dynamic as much
as it actually does it's a it's pretty
awesome solving puzzles cooperatively
with people awesome last question is the
cake a lie
yes
there you have it folks the cake is a
lie from my Eric with portal 2 we will
check in with portal more so check the
website for updates thanks to Eric and
we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
