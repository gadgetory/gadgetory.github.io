andy has undoubtedly gained market share
over the last two years and multiple
factors have aligned for andy here so
really mixture of skill and luck with
this one obviously the Zen architecture
launch was a huge deal for Andy I put
them back on the map with a Seabee
architecture that's genuinely pretty
good and also some misfortune for its
competitor Intel which is dealing with
issues like shortages of 40 nanometers
supply inability to hit targets with ten
nanometer and then overall shifting its
supply from the DIY enthusiast space to
a lot more OEM and s eyes as the company
has struggled to keep up with demand and
these factors have all aligned to enable
AMD to retake critical parts of the DIY
enthusiast market which our channel
represents so that's what we're looking
at today any one of these things would
have helped AMD coming back from FX
which was really just not successful
especially in the last few years of FX
before Rison but having all three
aligned together does give aim the huge
boost so in addition to all
Intel zone sales volume has been tilting
and in a way that the higher-end
processors are now the primary
processors from our audience being
purchased from Intel where the i-5
segment has basically died it's been
completely consumed by the r5 segment
from AMD a massive change because up
until a couple of years ago it was not
uncommon including from us to see
phrases like an i-5 is good enough for
gaming which was true but now there are
better things today we're looking at
affiliate sales from Newegg and Amazon
over multiple years of operation
spanning both gamers Nexus dotnet
readers and our YouTube viewers we need
to set some ground rules here so first
of all this data represents our audience
you shouldn't take it on extrapolated
across the entire market we don't really
know what's being sold in the OEM or si
segments we can postulate that it's
mostly Intel because if you look at any
of their systems they are mostly Intel
and this is an issue and he has
discussed with us as recently as CES
where the company said that it is now
trying to target OMS and SAS get more
inclusion in those pcs but either way we
can't get total absolute market share we
can get sort of a sales volume or a
market share shift of our enthusiasts
audience so that's rule number one that
will skew the data because it's skewed
towards what our viewers would buy
second rule is that our reviews and our
content will skew the data as well so if
we tend to favor a particular processor
in reviews that one is more likely to be
purchased by our viewers and our
2017-2018 best CPUs content would
influence that as well so when we said
the r7 1700 was a good all-around choice
we said the 8700 K was one of the best
choices from I think two years ago now
that would influence the data so keeping
that in mind we can get a cross-section
of the enthusiasts audience and get an
idea of CPU buying trends our
head-to-head data goes back to 2016 when
we moved a lot of products through
Newegg via gamers nexus net the website
the data set starts with Intel holding
it roughly 80% of monthly sales in
October of 2016 with AMD at about 20%
the next several months looked bad for
Andy dipping roughly to 7% sales in
December of that year
nearly all units sold we're going to
Intel and this was a period when Andy
didn't yet have Rison the company was
surviving entirely on aged FX and APU
product things started improving a
February 22nd of 2017 which is when
pre-orders open for Rison 1000 series
CPUs and declines back to 20% in
February then spiked hard to around 43%
in March the CP is released on March 2nd
starting with the 1,700 1,700 X and
1,800 xep use and he started dipping
again after this initial excitement
period eroded and this was the closest
that AMD had been in years to Intel
levels of sales volume Intel develops
distance in June when its 7900 X + i9
CPUs first hit the markets regaining
some of the market interest things
changed again in August with the
threader for 1950 X launching on August
10th and the 1900 X release in end of
month alongside intel's i 979 ATX II the
Saturday 9 DD X II wasn't enough to
resist and these advances though and the
two companies hit parity for the first
time in GM's tracked sales history from
our affiliate accounts with Amazon and
Newegg
this dates back to 2011 so we hadn't
seen parity or any any instance where
AMD outperformed Intel for several years
that was since since 2010 2011 and the
Intel both started moving an equal
amount of CPUs at this point and the r5
CPUs also were on the market launching
alongside the stranglehold that Andy
would eventually begin to develop on the
mid-range market sort of pushing out the
i5 CPUs this is where it really becomes
a war between the two companies
CBS started launching faster than ever
with 2017 becoming our busiest year of
CP reviews in jeans history in top
holdin all of its launch dates for 2017
bringing the i9 h EDT cpus to june from
an original end of your target so a
massive move there and also rushing the
i5 and i7 8000 series cpu launches by a
full quarter in fact it was so rushed
that only the Z 390 motherboards were
immediately available and even those
didn't have high quantities out the CPUs
were tough to find and mainstream
chipsets like the non Z 390 chipsets did
not launch with an on K CPUs which may
absolutely no sense and didn't gain any
reviewer sentiment this Illustrated
Intel's rush to get CPUs to market
before the holiday and it was a scramble
that was enacted almost entirely because
of the AMD moves that were made earlier
in the year the CPUs were planned but
the launch dates were not Intel
announced the 8000 series CPUs in
September and launched them in October
of 2017
unfortunately for Intel as Black Friday
rolled around the company got
steamrolled in sales volume Intel moved
just under 40 percent of our total
tracked sales volume with Andy
stretching past 60%
Rison 3 &amp;amp; 5 had launched in July
threaded 4 in August and r7 in March so
this was when the full product stack was
on the market we reported on several CPU
and motherboard combo deals for Andy in
November but we did also post PC build
guides for Intel and Andy systems alike
Intel also got recommendations and other
content so it's not like it went
unmentioned in our coverage Intel almost
never has sales or discounts on its
stock even old stock
so Andy easily commanded this holiday
season by lowering its prices or doing
combo deals where Intel would not
November had very high sales volume for
both companies but Andy one out for
November rolling the chart into 2018
last year started with rough parity with
AMD launching the APS in January and
February and Intel launching its new
chipset the next major release date was
the 2700 X in April of 2018 up until
this point sales pushed higher for AMD
March primarily by constant sales on the
1000 series rise in CPUs the strategy of
dumping old stock worked well because
the motherboard socket is the same users
could reasonably be convinced to buy an
older Eisen CPU on sale kinks now mostly
worked out in BIOS and then upgrade
later this allows AMD to develop a
market for its new CPUs and fray the
edges of Intel's market share even if it
has to drop prices in order to start
gaining some of that foothold June saw
Intel pushing past AMD where we saw a
high volume of i7 sales with the stock
of i-70 coming back to the market the
9000 series helped Intel regain volume
in September and October
but AMD again won Black Friday and
a large margin we first reported Intel's
14 nanometers shortage at lumen in July
of 2018 we had some initial hardware
news coverage of it and by November this
was a widespread issue into 2019 and
tell CPU supply has tilted heavily to
system integrators and OMS allowing the
DIY market to partly dry up and allowing
prices to rise finally in March of 2019
the chart flipped the inverse of the
beginning of the chart with high
combined sales volume between the two
and he held over 80% of total sales to
our viewers in march and the now firmly
leads Intel in our chart here although
average selling price helps Intel
maintain similar total revenue through
our viewer and reader purchases the next
metric to consider is the average
selling price despite a dip in sales
that has allowed AMD to post more units
moved per month in some instances Intel
has managed to keep relatively close in
total revenue generated with fewer sales
to the DIY segment in our audience in
2016 our viewers typically bought Intel
CPUs averaging $256 spend with the rarer
AMD purchases sticking closer to $104
average most of these were FX CPUs that
were getting dumped and hitting the
bargain bit 2017 saw ASP increased to
200 $78 for Intel CPUs among our
audience with more users trending toward
i7 SKUs but still a lot by an i-5 AMD's
ASP jumps to $273 with the launch of
Rison particularly because of the more
expensive r7 series 2018 saw Andy
holding steady at around $270 ASP with
Intel massively jumping even with the
large data sets we're now looking at
these later years all the way to $371
ASP this isn't just from gradual price
increases as new CPUs have come out but
also because Intel purchases have
trended away from the core i5 which was
popular in 2016 and toward the i7
instead that's because Andy is beginning
at this point to grab more of the i5
market with its r5 CPUs something that
we recommended heavily when we reviewed
the our 5s and thus forcing Intel's ASP
up as more users are either going for an
r5
or an i7 or maybe an i9 2019
today it has Intel trending at $410 ASP
with
the users thus far at $212 for the
average selling price this is a result
of continual shortages for Intel and
increasing popularity of the 9900 K
while Andy has dropped from the still
ongoing sales of rising CPUs CPU serious
choices have also shifted over the years
for the last quarter of 2016 the i5 CPU
is did notably well combining with the
i7 s to make up nearly all sales for
Intel in fourth quarter of 2016
this was the 6600 caiera which is back
when both I 5s and i7 CPUs were for core
solutions this is also when most of us
were saying quote and i-5 is enough for
gaming so it makes sense to see the
split 2017 changed that to lean more
heavily toward the i7 aligning with the
7700 K the i-5 remained popular and the
Pentium series gained popularity the
low-end market by undercutting some of
AMD's solutions where we really saw the
shift was in 2018 or processor shortages
and the shifting focus to the high end
resulted in the creation of a new market
in the i-9 segment particularly with the
9900 K 2019 further solidifies the
reduction in I five sales as I nine move
to take the place of i5 and i7 CPUs in
popularity again this is for a few
reasons one is the CPU shortage and
Intel's shifting of processor inventory
towards system integrators but the
larger change is that Andy has taken
most media recommendations for the
mid-range market at GN we typically
recommend an r5 over an i-5 in most use
cases and we're not alone if people buy
Intel it's trending toward higher end
more expensive parts by the company
whereas Andy has a wider spread across
mid-range part selection moving on to
the AMD chart now the AMD chart shows
the limited selection in 2016 where we
primarily reviewed the AP use that Andy
had that year and whatever FX CPUs were
left so it makes sense to see that a10
purchases were high that's mostly what
we were covering most of the visitors
that landed on AMD cv reviews on our
site we're reading about the AP
performance and so we're more likely to
purchase something like an a-10 either
way it's not like much else was
available outside of FX or AP use in
2017 we saw the split most heavily
favored the r7 cpus at over 40% and the
total sales volume with the r5 ranked
the next highest at
over 30% the r3 held about 11 to 12
percent sales volume with threader for
making up about 8% of sales volume for
AMD FX had a surprisingly high
distribution in 2017 but was on the way
out this distribution of our seventh r5
is fairly healthy and across the entire
stack we get a predictable scatter of
samples for Andy Andy did well to push
more units at its high end and this
continued into 2018 except that the r5
captured more sales from the r7 CPUs and
the die in FX CPUs the r3 CP is trended
down as they became more focused on
Raven Ridge and thread River posted
stronger numbers from another release
and constant sales of the 1950 acts in
1920 X 2019 has shown a more even split
between the r5 and our seven pulling
market share away from Intel's i-5
segment and E is really picking up steam
here finally and tall needs to get more
CPUs out the door first of all needs to
fix its shortage issues secondly Intel
needs to strengthen its offerings in the
mid-range market because right now an i5
is just it's really not compelling in
almost all cases the r5 is typically
cheaper you got something like 2,600
2,600 X maybe it does well in a lot of
applications does better in things like
blender on average than Intel it's
competitive enough in games that for the
r5 it's more justifiable to sacrifice a
little bit of potential single thread
performance for the balance that you get
whereas an r7 there's fiercer
competition with the i7 SDI nines and so
Intel to really regain that market
segment it once held dominantly the i-5
segment it has to release a more
convincing offering and it's an
interesting strategic play where Andy is
constantly putting at CPUs on sale so
even if there's lower margin and these
doing well to capture more market and in
a world where up until recently Andy was
just simply not trusted to make a CPU
it's important to make sacrifices like
margin to just try and bring more people
on and get them accustomed to the new
rise in processors and try to convince
people that look this thing actually
works we're serious this time this isn't
another bulldozer product so it's it's
good strategy from AMD and it's allowed
Andy to to really start shifting that
sales volume in charge so the longer
Intel
sacrifices it's made it's mid-range
market and the mainstream market for
gamers the lower the sales volume will
be overall because I 799 although intel
is doing well their ASP is trending up
for them it's also not high volume or at
least not as high volume so what we're
left with is Intel's
average selling price is going up but
that's not just because some of the
prices have gone up like the the 9900 K
which is clearly more expensive than
previous flagships it's primarily
because fewer people are buying lower
end CPUs from Intel Pentium for example
used to be fairly popular and the g35
3568 whatever it was called the G 4560
those CPUs 5600 those were fairly
convincing CPUs and in a world where
Intel's got constant shortage issues
they're not really being made anymore
the 5600 the 4560 they were often 80 to
$90 and so no one bought them but when
they're supposed to be $60 they're
pretty compelling so this is Intel's
conundrum right now and and Eocene
higher volume overall moving to our
viewers and readers in the first quarter
of 2019 so that's it for this one thank
