Nexus Donette and today we're reviewing
Silverstone's tundra tt-02 closed-loop
liquid cooling solution this is a CPU
cooler and it is using liquid of course
so this is a bit different from other
CFCs we've reviewed because the Corsair
H series coolers and NZXT X series
coolers are all supplied by ACE tech so
they're very similar in their make and
design and engineering because it's
literally the same parts just rebadged
and there's some software on top of it
so this doesn't use A's tech and it does
have custom design elements from
silverstone so it is a bit more
interesting to review in that respect
most noteworthy is the radiator itself
the radiator is super fat it's like 45
millimeters or something it's almost
twice as fat as the standard ace tech
supplied radiators we see in these
coolers it is a 240 millimeter CLC so
that means we have two 120 millimeter
fans and the radiator itself is actually
about 280 millimeters long so pretty
standard in terms of 240 millimeter
designs for CLC s we have a normal pair
of hoses going down to the CPU block the
CPU block is actually pretty fat as well
it is a bit fatter than normally as the
radiator is and that is because
silverstone has ditched the plastic
that's found in a lot of these cpu
blocks so they're using a unibody
aluminum design and and it's got the
mounting mechanism with screws at the
bottom if we flip it over we'll see that
the cold plate also lacks screws this is
a common theme in this cooler as you'll
see it lacks screws in the bottom which
theoretically this improves the thermal
conductivity a little bit or I should
say the thermal dissipation because we
have more surface area to spread the
heat across because it's not being
interrupted by screws in actuality the
CPU is never going to touch those screws
anyway on any of these other coolers so
I think the practical difference is
pretty minimal the radiator is also
screwless if you were wondering and it's
all held together by a an aluminum shell
on the outside so pretty nice-looking on
the whole if you're wondering why the
radiator is so fat and if you're not
familiar with radiators they work
basically just by running
liquid pipe from one side of the radio
to the other where the the hoses will
basically import and export the fluid
and the pump on top of the CPU pumps it
so that's how they work at a top level
the fins the aluminum fins are normally
found between the liquid pipes the the
actual pipes in the radiator and those
are used to conduct heat from the pipe
from the metal pipe which then obviously
is blown away by the fan so that's what
cools down our liquid that is our
cooling process and in this radiator the
liquid pipes are actually surrounded by
aluminum fins so instead of just left
and right side it's actually top and
bottom as well once again theoretically
improving the thermal dissipation
potential speaking to the installation
process I was very happy with
Silverstone's installation for the
tundra td0 - it's super straightforward
you put your backplate on you mount the
radiator you mount the fans and you
basically drop the CPU block on top of
the CPU with some thermal paste and you
screw it down no stupid mechanisms her
brackets that slide around everywhere
involved so a very nice move away from
some of the less functional mounting
processes for these ACE tech coolers
however the radiator is so big that a
lot of cases that are built with special
compartments for 240 millimeter
radiators in them will not support the
silverstone t do - as is the case with
the phantom cases and the top
compartment because it's just too big it
doesn't fit in there so you're gonna
have to hand it down into the case and a
lot of these situations and that does
mean you're gonna be removing probably
your rear exhaust fan in order to
accommodate the radiator hanging down
depending on your case if you have a
huge case it should be fine so not a big
deal but is something that is worthy of
note as far as the benchmark
performances first of all nothing beats
the an Tek 1250 it is still the king of
our benchmark
next is the coarser h 110 then the the
1250 again in a custom setting and then
the coarser h 90 is tied with the tundra
td0 to that we're testing today so the h
90 is a 140 millimeter cooler and the TD
0-2 is a 240 millimeter cooler if you're
wondering why the H 90 was tied it's
because I wanted to do a real
test so the h9t can fit in our test
bench in just the rear position or just
the top position and that means we have
room for other cooling fans in the case
the tt-02 is big so I had to remove the
rear exhaust fan I obviously had to
remove the top fans in order to actually
fit the cooler and so that meant we had
one less fan running during the test now
you might say hey that's not fair it's
not an equalized test but I do draw some
lines and one of my lines that I draw is
ensuring a real-world scenario in the
real world the you as a user will not be
getting rid of one of your fans in the
case randomly just because you want to
you're gonna leave it in there and
you're gonna install your age 90 in a
different open slot so that's what I
tested for these are tied in that
scenario if you're just running the
cooler on a bench with no other fans the
tt-02 should slightly outperform the H
90 it should be better than the custom
setting for the 1250 and a about tied
with the H 110 so it'll be kind of in
between those two if you test it flat
out with no other fans in the case so
and all be all it's a good cooler it
does what it's supposed to do it
installs extremely well I was very happy
with the installation build quality is
solid the aluminum is very nice the lack
of screws is kind of a it's a cool thing
it's more of an aesthetic thing so it
all it all looks very good and it
performs fairly well the cooler is $120
so it is the same price as an Tex 1250
which makes it difficult for me to
recommend because the 1250 has
significantly better software control
and you have a bit more control of it as
the user however the Silverstone one
does have a different aesthetic and
honestly that's what a lot of this comes
down to once you're past build quality
is aesthetic so kind of pick between
them based on what you think looks
better and if you care about those extra
two ish degrees Celsius and that's all
for this cooler so leave a comment below
