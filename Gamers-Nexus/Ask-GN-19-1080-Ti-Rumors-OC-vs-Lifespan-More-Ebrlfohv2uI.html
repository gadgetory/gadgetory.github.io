ask GN and as always that leave your
comments below for questions for next
week's episode we skipped last week
because I was in Taipei Taiwan with
Keegan who's one of our camera operators
and we were working on Computex there's
a big show if you have questions from
Computex leave them in this video or
just generally about the trip factories
all that stuff and I'll try to get to it
but this video is brought to you by
enter Max and their new lick max giant
open-loop liquid cooling solution from
Computex let's get into this thing so
the first question is from last week's
ask GN and it is from Topanga win' I
don't know if tap Angwin represents the
Linux community or not but certainly a
good fit the penguin says what do you
think about the 1080 TI rumors and what
strategy do you think will NVIDIA follow
when deciding when to release it so I
guess in terms of the timeline and
things like that so first of all the GTX
1080 has had a lot of fanfare behind it
I went to one of the Nvidia sort of
low-key breakfasts events at type at the
Computex show and you may have seen it
streamed where Jensen just sort of
approached press about the 1080 and all
the previous update basically recapped
everything the last few months so I
didn't get great information out of that
event it was just a recap but the point
of bringing it up is because they again
pushed the 1080 very hard and I think
NVIDIA is gonna remain focused on the
GTX 1080 for the time being I have hair
in my mouth
they're pushing the 1080 so much it's a
big car they don't have a lot of
competition at the high end right now
the fury X is really not there's more of
a science experiment with HP M not a
competitor to the 1080 and because of
that I think the 1080 Ti is still good
ways hour I mean at least end of year if
then it might be I would suspect very
late to quarter four or next year in the
first half that would be kind of my
suspicion now that said there's no
official release or information about a
1080 Ti ever been planned to exist so it
might not even happen at this point we
don't really know but the 1080 Ti it's
unknown right now
for sure if it'll have HBM HP up to or
g5x AKA gddr5 X I would certainly
suspect either HP m2 or g5x but I'm not
sure which I will say the HBM to yields
are still really bad right now and that
would be part of the reason to delay but
the other one is just because they've
got a good grip at the high end of the
market and it wouldn't really make a lot
of sense for that and for NVIDIA that is
to compete with themselves right now so
in terms of rumors on the release date
that would be my guess it's quarter for
the first half of next year in terms of
rumors on specs I don't really have any
thoughts right now because none of the
rumors are there's no reason for them to
really be believed the one way or the
other we've seen reports of HBM - we've
seen reports of g5x
seeing that it might be on a GP 102 die
which is certainly possible we don't
know anything about it yet officially so
I'm not really gonna speculate on the
specifications at this time
next question is from Al Ahly nuts Allen
he says hey man love the channel my
question is if you have a closed window
panel will it be more silent instead of
a an open window one talking about PC
case by the way uh-huh so I think the
question is if you have a windowed side
panel on your case versus a steal side
panel with no window I think that's the
question but they could correct me if
it's not if that is the question no any
case with a window will by nature of
having a window be louder at least you
might say that I mean things like
acrylic and sort of plastic windows that
you find in most cases tempered glass
I'm not sure what the acoustic
properties of that are actually that's
still kind of new to our lab it's a big
trend this year so I'll be testing it
but in terms of what you find on most
cases anything that's acrylic or plastic
is gonna leak a lot more noise than a
giant piece of steel with foam padding
on it or something like that and not
every case has foam padding but it's
pretty popular if you look at for
example the dark bass 900 which was just
announced last week at Computex that's
got two options one is tempered glass
for $250 and some other features or you
get the steel panel for two huh
without the other features but basically
tempered glass versus steel the steel
panel has a sort of foam absorbing sound
absorbing material and that I guess
damping is the correct word in this
instance that would definitely keep more
of the sound inside the case and been
prevented from getting to your ears then
a glass or acrylic panel would so I
think that answers the question pretty
thoroughly but let me know if not Tec
Jose populism says this was on I think
this was in response to our sort of very
very casual does the GTX 1080 bottleneck
on CPUs question from last video so tech
chairs populism says going off of what
someone said on this common thread but
emphasizing do and will CPUs bottleneck
the 1080 more less or the same on lower
resolutions like 1080p vs. 1440 or 2160
being 4k in that instance well CPUs be
more or less important as we go up to 4k
or they just as important rendering
frames so a couple things to this
question first of all anytime you lower
resolution you are reducing strain on
the GPU it doesn't matter the API just
by nature of pushing fewer pixels the
GPU strain is lower so in those
instances I depending on what is sort of
meant by the phrase CV bottleneck
because a couple different means but
depending on what's meant certainly at
1080p you would be more likely to see a
1080 at ten seventy at a nine eighty i
hitting the same framerate then at high
resolutions and when they do hit the
same framerate like that it means that
there's a bottleneck either on the
software side so some games may choke on
CPU threads or on the hardware side
where the CPU is not keeping up with
what the GPU demands and in either that
may be draw calls or something like that
dx11 but in either instance if you're
hitting sort of an average FPS wall at
1080p that would be something you could
partially improve with the CPU if you
overclock order get a different CPU or
whatever and that does depend a bit on
the game now at fourteen forty and
twenty one sixty or 4k as it is more
commonly known
it depends a bit on the API and all
these resolutions the CPU does work with
every frame it renders so the higher
your FPS the more work the CPU is going
to be doing just by nature of the they
think it kind of work in conjunction
like that
so there's always a good reason to have
a CPU kind of answering that part of the
question but as you do push more pixels
it's more likely that the GPU will
become a choke point so I think that
answers that one the next question meant
Barry Dunne says from previous ask or
this is my no this is mine up from the
previous previous ask GM so this is from
three weeks ago now the question was at
around 7:20
you mentioned 1400 1450 megahertz for a
980ti as high to sustain for the long
term meaning I said something about
those frequencies being a fairly high
overclock does that mean keeping my
980ti overclocked around there without
touching the voltage at all well shorten
its lifespan so overclocking the nature
of overclocking there is an inherent
risk to shortening the lifespan of your
product or to just killing it outright
depending on sort of voltage and power
and things like that generally anytime
you're increasing and I did answer this
in a comment so I think we're clear
there but anytime you're increasing the
power target on GPUs so you'd say go
from a hundred percent to 120 percent
and then increase the voltage there is a
risk that the cards life will be
shortened and it is probably going to
happen but as I said and I reply to this
question in the comments there's really
no good data out there because it's
really hard to run that test I mean for
us to to collect lifespan data on GPUs
the impact of overclocking versus non
overclock GPU the trouble you run into
is you basically you need five to ten
benches running the exact same hardware
just for parity and then you have to run
some of them overclocked and not for
several years so there's no good data on
that but generally the consensus is any
time you increase a voltage and power
you are threatening the life of the
silicon it's not SPECT for it it
probably doesn't like it too much
silicon does like heat and actually
FinFET process does like voltage to
stomach
cent which is something we'll talk about
in a future review but generally that it
that is a threat now if you're keeping
your overclock there without touching
voltage especially without touching even
the power target I really wouldn't worry
about it probably the the impact will be
not that noticeable and the and the
scheme of things you'll likely replace
the card before it's relevant but if
you're if you're touching the voltage
and the power target then yeah it is a
threat last I guess comment is from
Saracen gaming who said dude I've seen
your vids a few times now remind people
to subscribe for more content at the end
because I forgot so many times Lowell
only just subbed so if you like this
