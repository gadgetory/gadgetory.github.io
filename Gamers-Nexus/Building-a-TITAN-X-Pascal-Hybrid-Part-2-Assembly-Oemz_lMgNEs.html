the Titan X hybrid build we tore it down
in the last video so we took the whole
thing apart that's the PCB talked about
that a bit in the last video talk about
the cooling solution a little bit - it's
a vapor chamber block with aluminum fins
somewhat standard no heat pipes in there
but that's because it's using vapor
chambers instead that of course mounts
to the PCB and then we've got this part
the base plate with the vrm blower fan
or just blower fan in general cools bit
of everything and that goes of course
under everything but on top of the GPU
and the PCB ideally we save this piece
for the build but before getting to the
build up process this content is brought
to you by iBUYPOWER
and their new elements gaming pc which
comes with arc LED fans red LED under
glow and a tempered glass side panel so
in this video we're gonna build the thin
backup hopefully the hybrid cooler that
I had with the liquid cooler I have for
the hybrid build this one here will fit
on the base plate we've had issues with
in the past particularly with the gtx
960 which required filing down the base
plate and it was a lot of work hopefully
this goes smoother it's basically a 1080
kind of mounting system 1082 everything
screws there's I wrote it down how many
screws are there about 63 53 about 53 or
63 screws something like that and so
this thing's got the copper protrusion
and the cold plate you've all heard it
by now that extrudes out like that or
protrudes out and from there you can
just watch our teardown of this
particular cooler to learn more about
how the impellers are set up and how it
works and all of that drain liquid and
all that in the previous video on liquid
cooler teardown stuff so let's build
this thing now starting with the PCB we
got to we got to go backwards a bit from
what was done in the previous video okay
so we got to go backwards a little bit
and rebuild part of the card but that
should be fine so this mounts here
pretty straightforward we're gonna need
that cable to be connected to the hybrid
so that's a bit of a pain because we're
gonna be tethered to the hybrid really
early in this process but that cable you
can see these have is kind of a splitter
connects into here and once it's once
the blower fan is connected to the pump
we can pretty easily connect both units
to the cards the card can PWM control
its fan as needed and the pump will just
blast as as it normally would okay so
this needs to come in through up here
cool there's about a million screws to
do in the back before we do that should
probably see if this will fit what the
contact is all that stuff how do we want
it to this let's get a couple screws on
here and then do the rest after the
concept is proven okay alright so that
should be enough to support this thing
for now let's see this will fit so can
always be applied I'm going to just I
want to route these out at the top
because this is a card that will
hopefully be actually used after our mod
the guy who loaned it to us Sam is
planning on using it in its liquid state
not its original state let's see if
there's contact there okay you can see
that there is actually an imprint so
that imprints what we're looking for
there's at least partial contact right
now the contact should be pretty full
once it's actually screwed down and then
tensioned okay so the base plate is a
little bit taller than the silicon but
this copper protrudes down into the
plate anyway so I think we'll be okay
probably let me try that again just to
make sure yeah I mean we're sliding
around on top of the silicon so that
looks like it's applying
to use that shim if the temperatures are
high then we'll know it's not full
contact we'll use a shim to fill out the
rest
that's the thing to look out for when
doing this stuff making sure the PCB is
straight if it's got actually gonna stay
like that for a while we don't really
care when it's just being built for
testing and taking apart but this will
be actually used in theory so it looks
good
gotta get the back plate on this I guess
isn't the ideal order we can look at
some of the other stuff first to make
sure when I can have to take it all
apart again so now obviously for this
fan to really do something you want it
to have a have this bit on it so that
the airflow is kind of guided so I think
we can get that on there
well maybe we might have to do some
modifications but I think we can maybe
get that on there that would certainly
be ideal this other part it is not is
not gonna happen without making some
cuts now for our own project I would
route the the tubes at the back of the
card because it just sits in an open-air
bench so what does it really matter are
they going out the back now in a case
you obviously can't do that because
there's nowhere for it to go and as I
said this is being given back to someone
for use later so we have to build with
that in mind assuming it works well that
is otherwise it's going back the way it
was Oh Dan nice obviously hitting the
table I think this will actually fit I
don't think that there's any way to get
this to fit reasonably without tearing
things apart looks like it would be
hitting kind of the height limit anyway
with this even if we took the pump cap
off
I think we'd still well it might work
with a pump cap off but regardless you'd
have to cut holes in here for these to
go through I don't really want to commit
to that I want to keep this mod as as
simple as possible I don't want to
actually modify the original card the
warranty purposes it's not my card
things like that so we're just gonna
keep it like this for now
and I think this thing can get on there
there so let's let's get this part of
the shroud on there this is the LED
cable again that will get plugged in
topside now I will just show it to the
camera to straight down on that that
white piece there so that plugs in there
okay can you grab me the electrical tape
Oh
sweet so next is these screws that's
just not gonna work no matter how we I
mean now we can't we could we could
route the obviously take this off and
run that through here or through there
even before installing it and kind of
slot that down and put that on the same
time to that for 1060 but the problem is
again we'd have to be cutting metal here
certainly doable but let's say that for
another time so for now we'll leave like
this not a hundred percent ideal but it
will work pretty damn well regardless
we're still pulling up all of the heat
away through the pump through the cold
plate and this will do a little bit of
coil and it's not going to be as
effective because well first of all few
things this is a non there anymore this
is what sinks the heat from the vram and
air from the GPU itself and from the
vram surrounding components the base
plate sinks the heat for the BRM which
this will cool and is cooling so that
takes care of the BRM this takes care of
the GPU the only thing not directly
cooled anymore by air is the vram
modules which line this area and those
are still being cooled by the plate
gddr5 X runs really low voltage compared
to some other types of memory that we've
seen in the past and that will help
reduce thermals if the memory is not
being supremely overclocked I think
we're going to be in good shape
talk to a few board partners about this
as well they've generally not been
concerned about it so I think we're okay
there really it should be fine
especially with the case fans and the
directional directional cooling within
the case so what do we have to do now
well I guess we can put the backplate on
there if you can call it that a piece of
plastic I feel like that's where's the
expansion thing there it is this goes in
there first
you're getting better than at this if
you seed so the the first ones these
were I mean they were a real learning
process having never really have done
liquid mods like that before so 1080 was
a big thing to learn Han would that work
if we took this off I think I think we
were to actually be clear we definitely
be clear without that on it so then this
would go under like that she was a draft
three we'd have to just cut like I don't
think we'd have to cut this lower one I
think we can just cut like right right
there up to here leave the top one uncut
and cut the bottom one I live I have
tools to do that I'm gonna have a
hacksaw I guess that would work he kind
of dremel I try calling Bob Stewart
okay well unless Bob calls me back we
will just go back to doing this for now
it needs to be like irrigation channels
to get them out if you drop one these
are those little ones that snap in half
if he's tighten it any like at all
as the instant it stops turning from
whatever force you're naturally applying
that's what it's time to stop there's no
it's not like it's really doing a lot
structurally it's just to hold the thin
on and not have any vibration oh I
should have done the other one first but
see if it matters
doesn't matter okay cool but they will
snap out of shot and then the head gets
stuck in the top part the rest of the
screech gets stuck in the there's a
little tiny heck or I'm hex keys so you
just have to be careful with these
okay cool magnet says I'm just so great
how does it work
okay that's mostly everything except for
the little these things which don't
really do anything yeah I really have to
put those on me for the top thing okay
well well test it first see how it
performs
make sure there's contact between the
cold plate and the GPU once that's known
I'll add these things back honey that's
certainly doesn't really need to be on
camera so those will go on in a bit yeah
hahaha there's extra screws obviously as
you can see it's not because it's IKEA
furniture and they've spent spares by
which I mean you forgot to put stuff is
and it's because we took us left off so
that's no longer on there that may be
added if we can figure out a good
solution one thought was that it mr.
Andrew had behind the camera was to take
our 1080 one of these cut a hole out
here and then we don't have to damage
the Titan x1 in case for some reason it
would be ideal to leave that in an
unmodified shape or warranty or whatever
so that would certainly allow that but
well we'll figure out if there's a good
way to cut it and if it makes sense and
if it'll fit and all that stuff later
for now this is the Titan X hybrid so it
is built in theory there is good contact
we'll find out pretty immediately if
there's not if not then it gets shut
down we'll take it off and put a put a
shim in there did that for the 10 16 it
worked actually really well still way
better than air like miles better than
air so we'll test this thing again
recapping stuff we've got the EVGA
hybrid cooler on here this is just we
have a lot of these so they work pretty
well for GPUs the best ones I've used
for GPUs then we're testing the Seahawk
aka hydrographics right now from MSI and
Corsair that uses an H 55 so I'm curious
to see how that prophet but that's
another story
that's on their pumps or tubes rather go
to the radiator tang
of course and that works as the radiator
would work got the blower fan still
there dissipates heat off the base plate
which is just where all the vram he gets
synced right here almost immediately
under the blower fan so that's good that
works this stuff won't get much air flow
from the blower fan it's fine I'll put a
case fan on it but I from talking to
manufacturers from our own testing it
doesn't really matter anyway memory
doesn't get that hot at the GD or 5x
especially and it's still under a base
plate and I've still got some kind of
dissipation going on so we're gonna test
this thing now come back for part three
to see how it performs thermally will do
the overclocking stuff overclocking
gameplay performance clock rate
stability over time versus temperature
fan RPMs all that stuff should be pretty
fun test and we'll have that for you
shortly so thank you for watching as
