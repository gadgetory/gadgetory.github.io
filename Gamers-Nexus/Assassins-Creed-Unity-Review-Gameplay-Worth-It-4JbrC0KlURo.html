excess net and i'm here reviewing
Assassin's Creed unity from Ubisoft
Assassin's Creed unity is the first
assassin's creed game to debut
exclusively on the new consoles and
obviously pc i had actually played
assassin's creed unity at PAX Prime this
past August and found the game to be
visually very stunning not only in its
effects but also just how many NPCs that
had on the screen and their level of
interaction and kind of like their body
language and whatnot so really that's
held up well going over to consoles and
in this full version of the game the
Parisian streets are just flooded with
people who are rioting people are having
conversations outside in outside of
restaurants there's a lot of activity
inside buildings as well so you're not
just going into the open world and
wandering into these empty buildings
there's interaction they're happening
among the characters this is a game that
is different definitely different from
the last probably the last two
installments of assassin's creed
assassins creed 3 taking place during
colonial america and assassin's creed
black flag which was in the caribbean in
the early i think early to 1700s during
the days of pirating so those games
relied much more on action scenes and I
don't just mean creep up on somebody and
stab that they had other ways of using
action to provide satisfaction that's
not a part of Assassin's Creed unity so
I think that that sort of divides the
audience based on where the series was
headed some people are actually going to
find it better that they can focus more
on stealth and having several different
options to way when when going into a
stealth situation is good outside of
that there are other opportunities for
exploration and kind of like puzzle
solving by that I mean that there are
clues around the city there are riddles
and things like that that need to be
solved and most of it is just
supplementary to the gameplay but that's
kind of how you'll occupy your time
outside of the stealth combat let's talk
a little bit about the storyline and the
protagonist here so the storyline begins
with a young are now
in France and his father is murdered and
he sees a I believe it's a watch with a
certain symbol on it and so then 13
years later he is at a soir√©e for his
love interest and he sneaks in because
he's not on the guest list anyway and so
his love interest to who's a Lee's who
actually turns up repeatedly in the
storyline her father is murdered as well
to our nose off to figure out who
murdered these loved ones i guess and
really he kind of resembles Ezio but
overall I found him to be fairly likable
let's talk about some of the mechanical
improvements in unity first of all there
is a two button combination that is used
for the free running system so you press
in the case of the xbox one controller
our trigger and the a button to scale up
a building and then our trigger and be
to scale down the building it doesn't
sound like the most intuitive way to
control somebody when when he's climbing
but it actually helps a lot in climbing
down because it basically ensures that
you won't have fall damage so that's
really good to see it's a fairly smooth
process especially when climbing down
you know you're just basically bounding
from ledge to ledge another thing is
that there is a Crouch button it can be
toggled by holding down L or you can
just excuse me you can tap L the left
trigger to slip into cover or you can
just hold down on it and then release
when you're done so I like that as well
but still I find the stealth system to
be kind of buggy kind of sluggish it's
really hard to I guess move from one
object cover object to another I'm kind
of surprised that we're at this point
you have 7 games into the series where
we don't have a fully would cover system
the mechanics of games like Gears of War
and even vanquish I know that they're
for shooters but it's a lot more
responsive okay now talk about the
combat engine Assassin's Creed usually
has a simple layout of buttons to use
for this is mostly the face buttons you
know X does one thing aid is one
beat as one thing and that's still true
here whereas in other games you had a
counter button there isn't a counter
here there's actually a parry so that
yeah it acts like a counter but it's
more I think I think it requires better
timing are no will actually position the
weapon correctly and so the animation
will play out well according to the
weapons that are being used it looks
better from from that sense you still
use your X button to do the striking the
enemies are there less generic I mean
each one will attack a little bit
differently especially since they're
using different weapons items like smoke
bombs and cherry bombs and the darts and
things like that well not the rope dart
but anyway these kind of deployable
specialty items are back I didn't see
enough of them introduced early on so it
kind of takes a while to get into that
Black Flag gave us things like the rope
dart and some other items there that I
like to use him right away so I wish I
would have seen that variety kind of
come out earlier one thing though that I
didn't like is the new aiming system in
other games you would hold a button to
go into a sort of over-the-shoulder mode
here you don't actually have your
firearm out you don't draw it it's still
concealed so you have to just kind of
aim as if you already had your weapon
and then you press the button then he
pulls and then he pulls out his are as
firearm and shoots so I didn't like that
and besides the reticle there really
isn't a reticle it's just like a tiny
white dot all right so now I'll talk
about a couple things I couldn't
actually cover in the review and that's
some of the social integration I'll just
give a quick overview so first of all
you have a sort of home base which is
called a cafe that has a variety of
rooms that basically you upgrade or you
spend money on in order to actually gain
money in return gain investment because
it's a cafe people come to the cafe and
based on your upgrades you accrue money
which is good so then in other words
you're making money as you're playing
the game while this sounds cool I really
don't understand why I have to go back
every time to collect my earnings I
actually have to travel back to my
coffee shop to gain the money I earned
so I can't actually use that once i
receive it to buy the next weapon
I want to actually have to go back and
get it so I really don't understand that
pure my closing thoughts on Assassin's
Creed unity again it's a
beautiful-looking game but again there
isn't that upfront value that I've
experienced playing the other games for
somebody like me who likes the more
action based open-ended games you know
red dead redemption I just don't see it
with this game so much the stealth
system moving in and out of cover it's
just not doing it for me I like I like
the addition of the Crouch button but
upgrades and player progression this is
a lot more detailed in Assassin's Creed
unity and for the most part it's a good
thing so instead of just picking out
your costumes for our no you actually
have per piece customers customizations
are five five categories of weapons and
the just varieties and each one is
pretty captivating so I like that a lot
maybe wait until it goes on sale if
you've played other games in the series
otherwise yeah there are a lot of
computing holiday titles so this is one
for consideration but this isn't a must
have in my opinion and also let us know
what you think about Assassin's Creed
unity and the rest of the series if you
have any questions feel free to type in
a comment or a question and we'll go
ahead and get back to you as soon as we
can thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
