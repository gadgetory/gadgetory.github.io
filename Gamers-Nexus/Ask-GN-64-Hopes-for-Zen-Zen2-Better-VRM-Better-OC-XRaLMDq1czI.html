of ask GN I sort of did these in real
life recently I helped our contributor
Patrick stone who's a high school
teacher teach a computer engineering
high school class about video cards and
GPUs so some of the questions for this
one will actually come from that class
but we've got a bunch from you as well
from discord and we might have one or
two from YouTube leave your questions in
the comment section below if you have
any for next week
the big ones though what are your hopes
present - how do you tell the difference
between video cards in terms of what
actually makes them good and then we've
got a couple on thermals that are really
interesting like does the temperature
scale linearly on the CPU versus the
ambient temperature before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor not
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee lake
temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below so the
first question comes from discord I
don't have the user's name written down
but they asked what's gns collective
hope for the tick Zen cores next year
which I would assume is N+ and looking
to 2019 what about Zen - also could you
do a newer video or feature on memory
performance and the differences between
dirt-cheap 2133 2666
and more mid-range or high-end 3,000
plus megahertz memory so addressing the
latter part of that first the memory
stay tuned we just spent a lot of time
testing memory all the way up to 4500
megahertz
we're just sifting through the data and
we're rerunning every single one of
those tests on another motherboard now
because they work differently on
different boards depending on the memory
support of the boards so we're working
through that it's a really cool feature
getting to forty five hundred megahertz
was really hard actually it took a lot
of manual tuning because you run into an
issue where not only are you now bidding
for better memory which you can just buy
off-the-shelf that if you want to spend
a ton of money on it but you're also
betting your CP
you for a hike or clock and a high IMC
performance so to get both of those
things is pretty difficult if you want
both the memory controller to be good
enough to handle something like forty
six hundred and if you want the memory
itself to the handle forty six hundred
forty five hundred and you want the cord
o'clock high but as for Zen to and these
n plus stuff so the the answer here what
is the hope for it first of all I try
not to have hopes about any product ever
it honestly I don't really speculate a
whole lot or or kind of like create a
fantasy world of performance for
different products because we're so
invested in the day-to-day operations
and testing that yeah I don't really
think that far ahead when I'm trying to
predict performance for the future that
said if I were to say what I wanted to
see in Zen I think one of the most
valuable things that Andy could could
achieve with the next Zen
implementations would be higher clocks
and they've got the core account down
pretty well they're competing with Intel
right now Intel won't be able to truly
respond in a serious way probably until
late next year and in terms of core
count that is and they responded with
coffee like pretty well but it's clear
that there's more there to do in terms
of catching up with just raw core count
and the price to per thread performance
when you look at applications like
blender but AM D has a lot of catching
up to deal with pure gaming and there's
room for them to do it so Zen was a
major change from FX especially in terms
of IPC fortunately it's also the first
step of this architecture so the
refinements you would expect to see
increased frequency this is typically
what we see it historically with other
CPUs from Intel and AMD alike what I
would like to see specifically is I
would love to see a 4.0 base or very
close to it and I'd love to see a four
point three to four point five gigahertz
boost on the
the core series competitors so the r3 r5
our seven four four five I don't need a
four three that would be great
anything in that range a couple of
hundred extra megahertz up to four point
three boost would be amazing and maybe
even they just get to call it 4.2 or 4.3
then they have some XFR on top for
single threat for a single core
performance that would be great
so that's what I'd like to see that's on
my wish list what I don't think we'll
see is one of the slides I saw recently
which I think may have been faked or was
I don't know a very misunderstood leak
if it was an actual leak but I saw a
slide somewhere that's had people in the
comments at least suggesting a
possibility of five gigahertz and 12
cores for I suppose what would
effectively be an r7 replacement I don't
think that's gonna happen I could be
wrong and I would love to be proven
wrong but five gigahertz is like a 1
gigahertz increase and you're talking
about increasing the cores that's that
would be an amazing engineering feat
again it's possible but I definitely
wouldn't put my hopes on that 5 you're
talking about going up to the speeds
that Intel can achieve with heavy
overclocking so even if it happens in
the very least you're throwing all power
efficiency out the window hundreds of
watts to get up to that kind of speed in
that core account and Rison is pretty
good at being power efficient it also
just like a lot of other architectures
on the market does start losing that
power efficiency as you push the
overclock to its limit that's kind of
what you expect with overclocking but
yeah I don't think 5 gigahertz is
happening probably at all I don't think
5 gigahertz with 12 cores is happening
and when I say at all or not happening I
don't mean ever I mean I don't think
it's happening with Zen Plus and I'm not
sure about Zen to know one is but I
don't I don't think I would anticipate
that but we'll see I have to see more
information on Zen tea that's that's a
while out at this point so it's possible
but Zen plus definitely
wouldn't expect it so yeah my my
wishlist is a higher base and boost and
then beyond that it's more of logistical
things than actual hardware so better
communication with motherboard makers
would be fantastic and he needs to kind
of you know you saw this with X 399 and
risin where there were two issues with
boards the one rise in first launched
you could get as many CPUs as you wanted
for the most part but you couldn't get
any motherboards Intel's having the
opposite problem so it was an issue of
the board manufacturers didn't have
enough time from the time that the final
micro code was submitted to the time
that the press had samples motherboard
makers had less than a month to get
their BIOS finalized and you have to
factor in the time to ship the samples
and organize everything - so two weeks
to get everything ready so that was a
big problem and that impacted launch it
also impacted things like memory support
memory sub timings all this really small
stuff that added up and hurt and these
initial launch and they improved a whole
lot of it really cleaned up but that
could be improved with better
communication and that is both on Andy
and on the motherboard makers I think
the motherboard makers at this point
know that AMD is serious now
so I think there's a better chance of
Zen PLAs and Zen to having more out the
gate support in terms of actual supply
and quantity of boards and probably a
more serious ear lended when it comes to
planning the product and making sure it
works with everything so I think it's an
issue of board manufacturers maybe being
in a position of fool me once and not
wanting to invest a whole lot in it and
of AMD not necessarily knowing how to
communicate what their needs were to the
board manufacturers or convinced them of
a good product hopefully a lot of thats
fixed just by being tested with time
another thing here better education for
media so we kind of went through this
ourselves where every time we asked AMD
for use cases for things like thread
representing you know you'd run into
scenarios where it's like okay so I get
it
it
fast but if I can kuta accelerate this
task where GPU OpenCL accelerated then
what's your use case give me an example
of something that I can test to show
that this processor makes more sense in
this application than a GPU does so
they're pretty bad at answering that and
we found a lot of answers on our own for
example with blender if you do an
orthographic render with an image that
effectively looks 2d at the end where
you're rendering tiles very quickly it
matters more from what we've seen for
the most part to have a higher tile
count in flight actively simultaneously
than just to have a GPU pushing it
because with thread Ripper you get 32
tiles in a flight simultaneously on the
1950 act and that's really valuable but
no one told us that we had to find it
ourselves unfortunately we can actually
find that stuff because we use blender
in-house but if you don't use blender
in-house as a reviewer and you just use
it as a benchmarking tool you might not
know so that's something where Andy
could improve on his education for media
there's a lot of other examples of that
too where ffmpeg h.264 encoding was
something we found at thread Ripper
really good at and we don't do GPU a
transcoding for our compression needs so
thread Ripper was a great use case for
that and so is our 7 but had to find it
ourselves so those are the things and
you can improve on its communication and
education for their partners and then
hopefully some frequency boost as well
next question this one is from supa who
says when discussing delta T over
ambient results for cases coolers etc is
it relatively accurate to assume that if
I ran an identical test in my home with
a different ambient temperature I get
the same a delta T basically if a CPU
heats up 50 C in a room at 25 C to a
final temperature of 75 degrees is it
safe to assume it also heat up 50
degrees in a 35 degree room to a final
temperature of 85 degrees this is a
great question so we're assuming a few
things here if you've ever taken a
physics class they probably made some
kind of joke like assume a spherical cow
or something like that Mythbusters did
that one is
well the reason you do that is because
obviously to discuss this we have to
assume that when you say you're running
an identical test that you also have our
identical hardware because the variants
even in silicon can change those numbers
so let's assume that let's assume that
we shipped you our set up the the
question just to recap is if my room is
25 and your room is 35 will the
temperature increase exactly by 10
degrees in your room in their final
readout because your room is 10 degrees
warmer and the answer is kind of but not
really so this is something we've spoken
with VSG from thermal bench about this
in the past months ago and I think
included part of his answer previously
but what it comes down to is the more
recent launches from Intel from Haswell
onward behaved a bit differently than
some of the others so before has well it
was more or less a one-to-one just like
you're asking with Haswell onward
so once you're at steady-state the core
temperature will increase almost the
same as ambient so that's that kind of
follows the pattern but the IHS
temperature is not the same increase
with ambient at steady-state that's
where the difference emerges so when we
spoke with vs geothermal bench a while
ago he observed that a CPU verse IHS
temperature increased variance was about
1.4 to 2.2 or two point four degrees
Celsius on a Haswell sample and that was
tested with a hot box that I believe the
SG configured between I don't know what
the low end was but let's just call it
30 C and I know the high end was ADC so
that was his ambient change this is
something 280 pretty big so speaking
with him it sounds like this is a result
of thermal resistivity of the heat
spreaders alloy having a hyperbolic
function with temperature so it starts
to run away a bit in other words as the
ambient temperature increases which
means no it's not perfectly linear like
we would like but the CPU core
temperature somewhat follows that curve
at least for a while and as you do
increase ambien it does get more extreme
and exaggerated so basically the ambient
temperature it to an extent we can
basically write it off as an assumption
of these will be pretty close they will
be at steady-state pretty much a
one-to-one gain in each but once your
ambien starts getting let's say I I'll
just give what our tolerance is if it
starts going above like 3 degrees
different that it's time to probably
consider alternatives the testing you
might be able to get away with 5 but as
you increase ambient more and more it
will run away more and more three to
five degrees isn't really gonna hurt
anything
realistically within the other
resolution of the test like the
measuring equipment and the software
measuring but once you start getting
beyond that it does get a bit
questionable next question is from I'm a
Jedi bra who says vrm on motherboards if
you use the same CPU to test multiple
boards will the vrm of each board help
determine the volts needed to run the
chips table at overclock better vrm
equals a better OC question mark or just
help with temperatures to spread out the
power and such so for this one there is
an extent to the usefulness of how high
end you go with V RMS and motherboards
there are definitely diminishing returns
at some point once you start looking at
a $200 board versus a $250 board a lot
of people would have trouble finding a
difference in terms of the max table
overclock the differences are elsewhere
often there is definitely a difference
to some extent with the boards though so
an example of this would be one of the
other z 370 boards we've been working
with with the 8700 K so on actually X to
99 boards as well on some boards the
better ones I'm often able to get the
same clocks as the lower end but with a
little bit less voltage some of this
comes down to the vrm itself some of it
comes down to the vendor and their BIOS
implementation for example the load line
calibration setting has a slightly
different curve with each vendor and
when you need to start using that
whether it's a flat line or a slightly
curved up line or slightly curved down
line
that impacts the voltage going to the
CPU ultimately and the B droop so that's
part of it
vrm quality is part of it spreading the
heat definitely if you're using for
example be 350 board with one of the
worst heat sinks and comparatively one
of the worst heat sinks and you're using
you have limited airflow you can
definitely make it throttle we've done
it pretty easily actually
but that impacts your overclock through
an indirect means thermal throttling so
as for ignoring thermal throttling
things like that the answer is yes kind
of you might be able to get a slightly
higher clock or more likely you get
about the same clock and you have better
voltage tuning options if it's a better
BIOS but uh yeah I spoke with builds
worried about this too and he agree
agreed that there's a limit to the
extent of how much you actually gain in
terms of noticeable clock and voltage
differences when overclocking on the
high-end stuff but there is a difference
the other thing is how much power can i
push so if you're if you're someone like
their Bower and you know you're gonna
push nine hundred to a thousand watts
into the CPU you better have a good idea
and understanding of what the
motherboards of erm can tolerate and
what kind of cooling you need to
tolerate it whether that's liquid
nitrogen or something else so there are
definitely places where it matters a lot
more but for the the non Allan to user
there's a limit next question is from
Darth
this one's really quick Darth says I've
been given conflicting advice when
recording gameplay on the same hard
drive as the game you're playing
assuming 70 to 200 rpm over SATA 3 is
there an issue of affecting the video
quality when using something like shadow
play the answer is basically no not with
shadow play not with I can't remember
how to pronounce it now relive a real
live relive right yeah and these relive
that name was an awful choice yeah I
think so I don't remember whatever it's
called I know I know when we did the
first video
on it there's no difference maybe with
frat well yeah with fraps so with
perhaps you will with hard drives
especially it'll bog down the drive and
so if the game is on that drive you will
definitely hurt the framerate we've seen
it and fraps basically records
losslessly it's hundreds of megabits per
second so that would be an instance yes
but shadowplay don't worry about it
RJ fleming on ask GN number seven that's
going back you said you use the same
bench to control for tested devices ie
CPU GPU heatsink etc does that mean you
also do not take driver BIOS or OS
updates to ensure data is not
contaminated
for example 1070 TI on 388 0 9 but the
comparison with the 1080 was surely on
an older driver just curious not much
can be done without rerunning the entire
nvidia lineup on a newer driver unless
you did that in which case you guys live
in the lab also do you use system images
to keep though eyes clean we do live in
the lab I especially live in the lab but
if you so the last question do you use
iOS M system images to keep those clean
we do so when I worked at Dell we
learned we had a really good system of
pixi booting where you would do boot
over Ethernet and so we'd pixie boot
into a server and then you stored all of
the system images at the time we use the
Norton Ghost and Norton Ghost would
allow us to clone the drives often
including the drivers sometimes you'd do
a bear clone and then not not a clone of
a bear but a bear as in Baron clone and
then pull that down so that allowed us a
lot of it afforded us a lot of
convenience and flexibility where during
testing something goes wrong it's the
same thing here where if your OS gets
contaminated and it will over time the
drivers get dirty or updates break
things or whatever you can just pull
down an image no big deal it's like 10
minutes to do to pull down the image and
you just start over with a completely
fresh OS all the test tools installed
the entire environment is ready to go so
it's like a 10-minute clean os+ set up
you can't get much better than that so
yeah we keep system images specifically
to make sure that there are no issues
with dirty drivers because that happens
a lot as well and a bad driver ruins the
data it's not even just the driver it's
even if you use ddu which we do it's
possible that something gets left behind
and messes up the results or maybe the
chipset drivers get messed up or when
you're swapping motherboards and CPUs
and GPUs and RAM windows has a tendency
to tie itself into knots
so this is what we call driver gremlins
and testing where you don't necessarily
know what's wrong but something's wrong
one of the easiest ways to create this
problem is to move a drive from an AMD
platform to an Intel platform or vice
versa and observe the performance
disparity and that's just because
Windows 10 has gotten better at it but
absolutely I would not do that for
testing we have isolated in tellen a.m.
the images for that reason the rest of
the questions do you control for BIOS
yeah that one's pretty easy to control
for we only update BIOS if it has
something we actually need or if we're
specifically reviewing BIOS and I have
another folder on the server with all of
the BIOS is backed up so we can pull
them if we need to go back for some
reason if we need to rollback drivers
drivers we control for as best we can
the thing with drivers is you kind of
you have to look at what change so we
keep close contact with AMD and NVIDIA
so that we can ask what changed in this
driver and then we do some tests on our
own so it's normally 1 or 2 ad hoc tests
just a dry run through everything make
sure nothing's changed that hasn't
changed then we can keep that data just
a little bit longer and if it has
changed clearly something needs to be
rerun so the difference with something
like a 1070 Ti on 380 809 is that often
the newest video card launch with its
press drivers that we use internally the
they sometimes get iterated on before
they go public
the press drivers we use internally are
a repackaged version of the most recent
previous driver just with included
support for the card almost never
there's a difference for performance
it's just basically they add support for
the card so fortunately we're able to
use the previous driver which we
probably used for another test and then
use 388 oh nine or whatever it is for
the 1070 TI that said every now and then
a driver release completely wipes the
results clean destiny to had such a big
driver update from Nvidia recently that
we can't use that data anymore for new
GPU benchmarks until we rerun the things
that are relevant so what I do obviously
part of what we do is try to retain a
large amount of data for comparative
purposes and then as stuff ships I will
rerun tests with a more limited suite of
card so destiny to again as an example
because I know that's updated I will
next time I need to attach the game I'll
rerun it with probably the card I'm
testing plus its competitors plus and
minus one price category and then we'll
leave everything else out and it sucks
to lose some of that data but that's
that what things like firestrike are
there for things like Metro last light
that's why you keep some of the old
games so that you always have scaling
data that drivers will never impact and
then then you can update the most recent
games with the most recent drivers so
there's a good spread of here's the
recent real use case and as an academic
study here's some scaling information if
you're trying to figure out how it works
with whatever and that answer is the
other question people ask a lot which is
why do you still test some of these old
games that's why it's there's nothing
wrong with having an old game or two on
there it's not taking anything away from
you and it adds data for people who need
it for older cards because just testing
the newest stuff doesn't help people
people are trying to figure out do I
need to upgrade from my three year old
device yes or no not well people who are
building a brand new system needs to
know how the new stuff performs but a
big part of the market isn't hopefully
that answer some there's so much more
information to that but I'm just going
to stop there if anyone has more
questions about it let me know below and
I'll take them next time
and I think there's a let's take this
one a question from so this is from the
class that I helped teach down GPUs so
the big takeaway I wanted them to have
at the end of the day was how to
identify what makes cards good in
general because these are our high
school students they kept asking me
which card is best for GTA 5 what's best
for destiny - it was always what's best
what's the best video card and if you
take that question at the face of it the
answer is a 1080i or a Titan XP you
should probably shouldn't buy those
though especially now if you're a high
school student who's either sponsored by
their parents or work in a low wage job
probably so that's the hard answer but
you know the teach this is all stuff all
of you know with teaching how do you
address your needs
my needs are this price this game do I
care about 3d rendering whatever but the
next thing I try to teach them was how
do you look for and identify what makes
a card good because I'm talking about
between AIB partners here not between
GPUs because everything I tell them
about the 10 Series today will be
useless in a year when they have the
money to build a computer because the 10
series and rx5 80s will probably be sort
of slowly vanishing from the market as
new things roll out whenever that may be
so instead of focusing on the rx series
on the 10 series what we did was to talk
about cooler differences and things like
that where you identify a good video
card by hopefully looking up some
reviews where they've done actual
thermal testing we do a lot of this and
power and noise testing so it's
important to identify what am I using
the product for how much money do I have
I try to figure that out before I start
looking and how much am I willing to
flex on the price and then you're
looking at ok with my needs maybe I want
silence maybe I want overclocked ability
then you go and look for the card and
and this is stuff most of you know
however
looking for a good cooler isn't that
simple as pick the biggest one because
as we learned with the zotac amp extreme
card the biggest cooler isn't the best
cooler so it does take looking for
reviews and if they don't exist for what
you want you can kind of look for photos
of like a side view of the card and try
and look down to see where this where's
the contact between the cold plates and
the vrm components are there thermal
pads where there should be is there an
unnecessary amount of plastic does it
look like the cooler itself is mounted
with hardware to metal plates like the
back plate and the base plate in
multiple locations or does it look like
it'll flex a bit how does it look for
sag things like that that's kind of what
you look for and then on component level
you look for videos from people like
build Zoid to figure out if those will
survive long temperatures and long up
times for overclocks
so really basic stuff but the kind of
fun thing with that experience was how
the wide spread of the knowledge level
in the class there were people who had
never built a computer and didn't know
what a gtx 1070 TI was which I named
because it just came out and there were
people who had built their first
computer already so it was actually
really difficult to kind of like step
back enough where everyone is following
you but still provide depth which I
guess is sort of what we do here just
added more with it with a baseline
assumption of knowledge that's a bit
higher so that's it for this one if you
