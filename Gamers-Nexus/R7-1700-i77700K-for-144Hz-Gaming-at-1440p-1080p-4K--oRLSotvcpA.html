game streaming ultimately ruling that
least 1,700 be best suited for a task
like playing games while simultaneously
live-streaming them today we're looking
at the other end of the spectrum which
one does better with 1440p 144 Hertz
gaming or 144 Hertz in general and
because we know that 7700 K is a leader
in gaming performance from our earlier
CV vowel night 1080p testing what we're
looking at is can the 1702 also achieve
that sort of frame rate we've put these
chips against one another before in VR
testing where our conclusion was that
the GPU choice mattered far more since
both CPUs can deliver 90 FPS equally
well and this newest test is a less of a
competition and more of a 10 the 1,700
do it to scenario the top of scene how
it has features that make an attractive
for casual streaming or rendering that
doesn't mean customers that want to
sacrifice smooth 144 Hertz and pure
gaming scenarios there are applications
or both
before getting to those that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
they're 1080p is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full sc2 review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080i
sc2 so look at this test less of as a
versus scenario and more of as a can the
1700 do it also because we know that the
7700 K weeds in unconstrained 1080p
gaming scenarios we know that already we
know that it's frame times are at least
the same if not better in a lot of the
games that we've tested
maybe not appreciably so but objectively
so and so now the question is to verify
what we and other media outlets have
been saying which is the 7700 K
theoretically could be 144 Hertz better
than the 1700 just like we validated our
own previous statements about the 1700
doing streaming while gaming better
turns out that was the case so we'll
look at and see if the 144 Hertz
scenario favours Intel list athena so
for this test we're using the review
sample r7 1700 all the testing
methods the specs for the machines are
in the article linked in description
below and that includes the latest BIOS
update for the crosshair motherboard and
then we're using the i7 7700 K that we
purchased from Silicon Lottery which
actually is a cool site so commodity
calm if you're interested so we bought
one of those to go along with our other
engineering sample which just was an
engineering sample so it needs to be
replaced
this one can technically go up to 5.2
gigahertz for this benchmark because we
haven't deleted it yet we are only going
to 4.9 gigahertz when we overclock for
the review sample 1700 were going to 3.9
gigahertz because that was the most
stable with all the games and then
otherwise running stock between the two
CPUs so that's what we're looking at for
the two processors and for the specs and
the rest is in the article I stated for
game if we chose five popular games that
we expected to run at 144 frames at some
level of graphics as in actually
achievable at 1440p because that was
ultimately the goal as 1440p 144 Hertz
when we asked on Twitter and in this
quarters patreon backers what frame rate
they preferred and what resolution they
preferred it on it was 1440p 144 that's
the growing one 1080p 144 was second
place but not anywhere close to leading
so even at high resolutions we tested
dual Mendota to rocket League overwatch
and battlefield one those are games
where you want the higher framerate
again
success here for the 1700 isn't defined
as victory over the 7700 K it is defined
as keeping up with the 7700 K just like
success for the 7700 K and the streaming
benchmarks would have been keeping up
with a 1700 since we know that each one
is already advantaged in its discipline
against the newcomer which in this case
is going to be AMD and the streaming one
was the 7700 K Intel CPU so before
diving into the results one final
disclaimer here the point of this series
we're doing these are follow-up tests
from the reviews the point of these is
to illustrate with a bit deeper testing
on each specific topic that there are
disciplines where each CPU
as use-cases it's not quite as binary as
by this one it's better for these two
especially these two are 5s i5s gets a
bit murkier but these two it's it's
really they've each got good
applications so we're trying to show
here's where each one of them stands out
and then hopefully you can take all that
data and make your own assessment
because we're not in a position to judge
if the 70 to 100 K or the 1700 better
fits your uses as a user that's up to
you to determine but we're giving you
all the data for each of the we'll call
them a stereotypical use cases that
people have brandished for each of these
CPUs overwatch starts us off we use a
special testing method for overwatch
that's detailed in the article links
below and was originally found when we
did our overwatch performance
optimization guide overwatch caps at 300
fps so we've got a decent lot of
headroom for testing but we're not
unlimited
starting with Penna DP at max settings
we're hitting 246 FPS average on both B
stock and overclocked 7700 K and as
detailed in the article below we're
using a 1080 TI FTW so we're up against
other limits here these two are
effectively identical in performance and
fall within our error bars indicated on
the chart the r7 1700 is capable of
achieving our 144 hurt to go although
the low-end frame times do dips down
below 144 Hertz if that matters to you
this becomes a game of perception and
subjectivity and speaking subjectively
we don't much notice the difference
there are certainly folks who think they
can see one and if that's the case it's
up to you to determine whether you fit
into that crowd if so take note and by
the appropriate CPU both of these CPUs
can sustain 200 Hertz displays at 1080p
is desired
though the 7700 K is a much better
option if higher quality settings at 240
Hertz are desired that is an insanely
small market right now let's just be
clear but the few who are truly
fanatical enough about frames to really
actually want 240 Hertz but wants out
for these 7700 K in this particular
title note of course that you can only
really do this append ATP with these
types of settings let's move on to 1440p
have this resolution everything levels
out to perform within a couple
percentage points an average frame rate
the 7700 K is tactic
leading but it's close enough to be
within our margins for this particularly
long test the r7 1700 is consistently
lower in frame times measurably and
repeatedly though not in a manner which
is appreciable both CPUs are capable of
sustaining 144 Hertz at 14:40 P and so
both past that bar minimally anyway
here's for K just to show it
we're completely within test margins
here and can reliably state that this is
completely GPU limited as you'd expect
this has become a GPU benchmark at this
point and is no longer a processor
comparison we're using the same card for
all tests so we're seeing the same for
Florence the differences here are
statistically insignificant and should
not be read into further than
effectively identical and within test
variants moving on to dota 2 the core of
our most recent 1,700 versus 7700 case
streaming test was dota 2 so it's only
fair that the game makes return here as
a side note because of this 144 Hertz
testing we discovered a typographical
error in one of our streaming benchmark
graphs pertaining to the 1,700 baseline
performance the FPS that is that's been
corrected in the article with a note
though the conclusion remains unaffected
basically the r7 1,700 baseline
performance that when not streaming was
lower than we originally thought but
streaming performance was unaffected and
remained identical since again just a
typo on the baseline item anyway that
cleared away now that we have a new test
to look at let's start with 1080p and
Ultra settings where we've manually
maxed the game dota 2 shows clear favor
to the i7 77 hard K and both its stock
and overclocked configurations will
later turn down some settings to try and
achieve that 144 FPS marker as you can
see the 7700 K is clearly ahead in this
title under current conditions and again
this is tested differently than our
previous dota 2 test because we're using
a different duration for the scene
tested so you can't really compare the
numbers we're at 174 FPS average on the
4.9 gigahertz 2700 K with a stock CPU at
164 FPS average one percent point one
percent low metrics are always distance
in dota 2 but are higher with the intel
part than the 1700 the 1700 is clearly
limiting GP performance here where we're
seeing a 117 FPS average when
overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz and 106
when and stock clocks those places the
over
7700 que 49% ahead of the overclock 1700
with the spark 7700 K about 55% that of
the 1700 stock let's move on to the star
of the show 1440p at 144 Hertz the stock
r7 1700 performs at about 106 FPS
average roughly the same as we saw at
1080p indicating that we're still
choking overclocking gets us roughly the
same within test variants I 117 FPS
average the i7 CPU is haven't really
changed here either we'll see more of a
change at 4k once the GPU bottleneck is
instantiated but for now we're clearly
Seaview bottleneck on all these parts we
want to know what settings would be
required to get the r7 1700 CPU up to
144 FPS and achieve our 1440p 144 goal
so we drop the settings as indicated on
the screen now with our low settings
we're able to free up enough of the CPU
to ascend to 149 FPS average one
overclock and nearly 140 FPS average
stock again this is by dropping
basically every setting down to low or
it's near level point that's getting
about where our target is to dropping
settings to low and overclocking pushes
beyond 144 Hertz territory on the 1700
just to close this one out here's a 4k
charged GPU bottlenecks finally enter
play choking the 7700 K down to 156 FPS
average the r7 1700 sits where it has
been for the past two charts and the CPU
is clearly the limiting factor here zoom
is up next and stands as one of the
lightest workloads we benchmark
presently despite looking pretty good
the game is well optimized to a point of
being difficult to benchmark at times
particularly given its 200 FPS physics
bug that causes framerate to lock the
closer we get to 200 FPS the less
accurate our top end results will be as
the frame rates are capped so that will
drag the average down for this reason
testing 1080p is pointless at 1440p with
ultra settings and asynchronous compute
on because they sync can be worse with
anti-aliasing disabled these days before
point 9 gigahertz 7700 K is
chart-topping at 181 FPS average 141 fps
1% lows and 1 24 fps your bond recent
lows the CP is beginning to bump it into
the 200 FPS limiter in some scenes so
this is truncated a bit the stock CPU
runs at 178 FPS average with the
overclocked 2.9 gig or at 1700 at 1:07
fps
Ridge Emilie's which are proportionately
scaled this place would be overclocked
7700 K about 8.4 percent ahead of the
overclocked r7 1700 not accounting for
the FPS cap the stock 1700 runs at 166
FPS average so we're really not gaining
much from the overclock in this
particular title at least with limited
upward scaling regardless it's clear
either CPU could reasonably achieve
ultra settings at 1440p 144 Hertz and
doom and so we meet our objective on
both the r7 1700 and the i7 7700 k
despite the latter is 8% lead both are
capable of achieving the goal so
depending on your uses you may well be
ok with a 1,700 at 4k resolution just
because that's what doom requires to
become stressful all the CPU has become
more bound by the GPU than anything else
getting stuck at 92 to 97 FPS average
the 77 hard K technically still holds a
lead here but not an appreciable one the
r7 1709 777 hard K are effectively
identical and for Florence with regard
to appreciable differences and neither
is capable of holding 144 hurt
we'd have to lower settings a resolution
to get that rocket League is next n is
an extremely undemanding game at least
without modification its maximum frame
rate is capped at 250 FPS out of box
just like doom anything beyond 2 - the
FPS will not be reflected in averages
since it's not recorded so our numbers
will be dragged down as we approach that
cap at 1440p the stocks coming tomorrow
DK was already at max - 49 FPS average
let me dance usefulness in the
comparison since there's no telling what
it would be running at without that
artificial cap the stock 1700 man is 203
FPS which indicates a cpu limitation
further proven by our improvement in
average FPS by 12.4% when overclocked to
3.9 gigahertz at 1440p we're able to
achieve 144 Hertz playback actually 200
Hertz playback on the r7 1700 the 71
hard K carries tighter frame times for
overall greater frame delivery
consistency and so there's an argument
to be made for keeping even low-end
performance towards 140 FPS but the
averages are passing on both the 1770
700k particularly after overclocking and
are largely not really appreciate kind
of higher than that anyway we've in the
4k the cat becomes less of a concern
we stray further from 250 FPS but the
CPUs are still about 144 average given
the low intensity of rocket League with
a 1080i the stubby semi-hard K is
holding its lead by about 10 percent on
average whether or not this is
significant and advantages is up to you
as the buyer and depends on your other
use cases if you're not going to use it
for anything else but this type of
gaming it may be by the CPU that would
best fit the scenario that be the 7700 K
if you're planning to do other things
consider the 1700 battlefield 1 is the
last benchmark these tests are conducted
differently from our standard
battlefield benchmarks just like the
dota 2 ones were here and so the data is
not at all comparable to pass data this
test is run using more intensive scenes
involving heavier combat that's recorded
over a longer period of time it's not
quite what you'd get in the 64 player
server so account for that but it is as
close as we can reliably get without
introducing a million uncontrollable
variables by 64 of meeting players at
1080p the 77 hard K leads at 174 FPS
average overclocked
or 172 FPS average stock this positions
the CPU beyond 144 Hertz territory with
the rs7 1700 falling just below at 132
FPS average overclock and 123 FPS
average stock low in frame times that
sit behind the 7700 K I have 1440p ultra
settings the 7700 K becomes more GPU
bound and limits to 133 to 134 FPS
average with results between the stock
and overclocked variants outputting
effectively equally link to the GB
limitation the r7 1700 now operates in
the range of 122 averages to 125 average
regardless of vendor neither CPU is
hitting 144 hurts at 1440p so to get
that we have to drop down to 1440p and
high settings with our lowered settings
the 7700 cup to 152 152 FPS average now
achieving our 144 Hertz gold and the r7
1700 sits around 139 FPS average when
overclocked or 133 fps hours when stock
it's tough to get much more performance
out of this given that most graphics
options in game center around GPU bound
items but lower in geometric complexity
and other led type effects would help
boost framerate a bit where Intel can
run a mix of high and ultra for 144
hurts at 1440p in our test environment
again your mileage will vary
and he needs to drop to a mix of medium
and high and again the point of this
coverage is to provide a look at the
reality of the situation of these two
CPUs they're both good CPUs but
depending on what you're doing one of
them may be less good for your use case
so this hopefully along with the
streaming benchmark and the VR benchmark
helps show where each one shines in VR
we saw no affective difference really at
all even objectively looking at the
numbers with really narrow margins you
just you don't see a lot of difference
with streaming there is a measurable
difference certainly and the 1701
handily over the 7700 K with this test
depending on the game we're seeing
scenarios where well generally as a rule
across all these titles the 77 RK is
basically always in the lead how much of
a lead depends on the game how much that
lead matters depends on the target
framerate in cases where we're going
north of 200 FPS like rocket League or
overwatch in some scenarios doesn't
really matter if you're targeting 144
Hertz maybe not but if all you're doing
is gaming the seventies when hard K gets
you that much further past whatever FPS
it is you want so it's entirely up to
you whether that matters
some people are frame rate nuts more
than others and I mean that's really all
there is to it if you're doing stuff
alongside this high FPS gaming for
example maybe you're a streamer and you
don't want to use an external box for
one reason or another and you don't want
to use that envy encoder for one reason
or another then consider the 1700 or
something like that because as we've
tested it is clearly superior in CPU
encoding tasks while gaming and
streaming simultaneously if you're not
doing that options include things like
blender animations or Premiere encoding
or something like that where if you're
doing something that's CPU accelerated
it would probably be better to get the
rise in CPU if you're doing something
that's very heavily CUDA accelerated and
your gaming otherwise the 7700 K is
still good by so as you can see this is
not me waffling between a decision
between these two CPUs I'm not trying to
appease everyone by saying both are good
at different things because the reality
is they are it's not an attempt to make
friends with colleges on the Internet
these CPUs are both good at different
things is very complex which one is
better and it depends entirely on what
you're doing so the point of this is to
say that despite what you see in
comments they're both good at different
things figure out what things you do
take our numbers and others hopefully
look around the web and find others and
combine them to figure out what you
should buy so at this point spectators
in the comments are probably getting
whiplash from crying chill for Andy and
chill for Intel depend on which
benchmark it is because as you can see
it sways from AMD to Intel who wins the
benchmark depend what task we're testing
and wins there's and scare quotes
because victory really depends on what
else the CP is going to do if it's only
gaming well I guess Intel wins here if
it's live streaming and gaming and the
wins there so it boils down the wins and
losses there's some of your wins and
losses though is that you can find more
information in the article below
hopefully this helps paint the picture
that yes things are quite complicated
with silicon and semiconductors and
processors and at this point you should
have enough data to put together some
thoughts on whether you need the 1700 or
the 72 100k for this type of workload

other types of workloads you can check
