Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
cooler masters tried-and-true hyper 212
plus CPU cooler
this one's been out for a while and is
often recommended for new system builds
but I've never really latched on to it I
always felt there was something better
available and for the purposes of this
benchmark we pitted the older hyper 212
plus against some of NZXT T's near
respires series coolers which are priced
within 10 bucks of the hyper 212 plus
and are similar in design and sizing so
let's hit the specs first and then dive
into thermal testing and build quality
we also ran a test to see if multiple
fans were worth considering so stick
around for that the cooler master hyper
212 plus is fully compatible with all
modern socket types including LGAs
dating back to 775 and AMD dating back
to am too including FM one the cooler
uses an aluminium and copper direct
touch cold plate which boasts a smooth
finish for better thermal conduction
from the CPU to the heat pipes there are
four heat pipes at six millimeters each
as opposed to the respire T 40s for
eight millimeter pipes or the respire
teach one a single eight millimeter and
dual six millimeter pipes the 212 also
includes one of cooler masters
flower-petal blade fans which is pulse
width modulation enabled and ranges from
600 to 2,000 rpm rating at roughly 21
277 CFM and 13 232 decimals all of these
are fairly reasonable and nothing really
exceptional nor nothing that's bad per
se it's it's definitely slightly above
average in terms of bearings the fan
uses a cheaper sleeve bearing so it will
grow louder with age and does not fail
as gracefully as other bearings might I
suspected that NZXT and Coolermaster
used the same or at least a very similar
supplier for their heatsink component
given the very very close design the 212
is firmly in between the t 20 and T 40
in terms of overall surface area of the
aluminum heatsink but uses its direct
touch flatter cold plate as a major
selling point meanwhile the T 40 and t20
are rougher on the bottom side with
larger pipes speaking strictly to
quality the cooler is mostly
Everage but has a few points I was
unsatisfied with the two twelves
additional fan mounting brackets snapped
upon the first use and installation and
it was I mean it just snapped I just
screwed it in like normally and one side
snapped so I was pretty uncomfortable
leaving my screw floating around in
there and of course the snap egde will
call it resulted in a bit of vibration
with the fan once it installed the
installation process as a whole is more
obnoxious than it needs to be and it is
fairly standard procedure if a bit
overly complex but I did find some of
the two twelves mounting bolts in my
model to have threading issues on the
front side which meant I had to
reinstall the backplate entirely with
each modification on the motherboard
side of the cooler so something as
simple as swapping thermal paste was
made minutes longer just by the fact
that I had to reinstall the backplate
let's talk thermals you can read our
full testing methodology in the review
linked in the description below if you'd
like to know how we actually test these
the hyper 212 plus operated toward the
bottom of our pack when using stock
thermal compound hovering at 2.5 Celsius
warmer than NZXT aspire T 40 cooler and
7.5 Celsius warmer than - Niek tower -
120 extreme excuse me cooler which is
priced at $65 so it is about twice the
price of the hyper 212 plus the respire
t 40 is priced at around 40 bucks so
that gives you some perspective there
the 212 faucet is still nearly 20 C
cooler than the stock units thermals so
it's it's definitely nothing to ignore
it's still good cooler with controlled
5.3 watts per meter Kelvin thermal
compound the hyper 212 plus is dead last
for aftermarket coolers and I found that
adding an additional fan resulted in
zero noticeable improvement in fact the
improvement was within margin of error
and was less than one Celsius difference
this is likely because the thermal
dissipation potential is maximized by an
already efficient single fan design so
don't waste your money on a second fan
for the 212 plus not to mention that the
math the mounting bracket issues I had
so I really don't recommend a second fan
for it on the other hand the respire t
40 saw a noticeable improvement with a
second fan installed but it is also
larger in breadth and width so it makes
sense because there's more aluminum to
be cooled so it can more efficiently
utilize that extra CFM airflow and
finally here's a value chart for you
this is calculated with price over delta
T using the stock cooler as a baseline
this chart is mostly useful for those
looking for a value optimized cooling
solution who people who aren't
necessarily interested in the best
overclocking option but just want good
cooling for the price we use all stock
pastes for this chart seen as that's
what chips with the units and additional
fans are assumed to cost eight dollars
the t20 has the worst value cooling at a
with a delta of thirteen point four C
and costing two point three dollars per
degree the hyford 212 cools Delta twenty
point five C and cost roughly a dollar
eighty five per degree meanwhile the -
nique 120 cools an impressive delta 28 C
but costs two dollars and twenty four
cents per degree so that is a decent
look at value for you overall the hyper
212 + is still a reasonable cooler it's
just not the best at the low-end anymore
and I'd really at this point recommend
the T 40 over the hyper 212 + any day of
the week at best the 212 plus is $10
cheaper and several degrees warmer but
at worst it has a limited upgrade
capacity seen as the thermal dissipation
potential is already fully saturated so
the extra 10 bucks is fully worth the
upgrade ability of the t 40 and that is
all for this time so I will see you all
next time be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
