and the recap there have without a lot
of nvidia and AMD news and we have that
for this week so nvidia has added
samsung memory to its roster for video
cards and the internet seems to be
jumping to the conclusion that therefore
all micron memory must be bad but that's
not actually why nvidia added the memory
to the roster of board components or to
the Bill of Materials also anybody a
driver fixes for most of the BS or DS
we've been seen we have an update on
days without our checks and games and
AMD with their very many news
announcements for GPUs and CPUs alike
before that this video is brought to you
by coursers vengeance RGB memory
coursers vengeance RGB Ram uses
pre-screened ICS for better overclocking
Headroom and tighter timings of courses
Ram also has the benefit of wide region
motherboard support by landing on
qualified vendor lists for motherboard
makers and trained wide compatibility
between boards learn more at the link in
the description below
first up Nvidia add-in Samsung memory to
its build materials for its video cards
for the RT X series this includes
partners as well a lot of the board
partners when they buy the reference PCB
and/or the GPU from Nvidia they will
also purchase the memory from Nvidia
after Nvidia purchased it from their
memory suppliers so Samsung memory is
getting a lot of spread here and because
of the artifacting issues that have been
discussed online it's not actually
widespread at this moment but because it
appears to be widespread from the
discussion online a lot of the
conclusions drawn are that well if
Samsung is being used now than micron
must be bad in reality it is possible
for of course some of the micron memory
to have been bad maybe a bad batch or
something where we haven't confirmed
anything yet but the reality is this
happens all the time
it's adding another supplier so that
demand can be met with supply of the
video card so this is not abnormal it's
every single GPU launch including with
Vega even as the as the memory supply
comes to fruition because it's a new
type of memory to dr6 it's not readily
available the additional suppliers will
come the market and supply the video
card makers with their memory so this is
not it's a bit of jumping to conclusions
a bit of
misconception but it is possible for a
bad batch of micron to have ended up on
the card just as we said but also
Samsung being added doesn't mean that
literally all micron cards are bad just
as some anecdotal evidence we have about
12 review sample 20 series cards and all
of them I think have micron there might
be one that Samsung but certainly almost
all of our micron none of them have
exhibited any issues whereas we have
basically an equivalent amount of cards
from you all on loan that are
artifacting or experiencing other issues
and those also have micron so some
anecdotal evidence for you but not all
of them are bad clearly either way
though Samsung's being added doesn't
necessarily mean anything we'll see
sometimes the memory might be capable of
higher speeds from one supplier versus
another but they should all meet the
baseline spec speed and it's primarily
overclocking or that'll really matter
also in Nvidia news is the driver update
that fixes a lot of the pSATS and some
multi-monitor issues so just before
Nvidia's newest driver release we
confirmed that BS ODS were largely
occurring from things like using G sync
displays using high refresh displays
using high refresh displays with G sink
especially and also multi monitor
configurations for causing various
issues so these have largely been fixed
about 24 hours after our first video and
Vidya had already been working on a
driver at the point we posted the video
of course they posted driver version for
16.8 1 which resolves several of the
multi-monitor related issues including
the following multi monitor idle power
draw is very high that was one of the
fixes blue screen crashes when exiting
games while using both a G sync and non
G sink monitor synchronously mouse
cursor are causing FPS to go out of sync
with window g-sync flickering in the
witcher 3 and then not listed are multi
various other BSOD issues including
those involving high refresh displays we
have seen some of the BS or the issues
that we validated disappear with this
patch so if you're still seeing them
post your monitor model below and any
information related into the blue screen
of death that you might be experiencing
or CT d's because this is a hard issue
to validate as we said originally it is
it's a bit spurious it seems to not be a
hundred percent consistent when BSO DS
will occur on the r-tx cards some people
have reported that their Titan V's are
showing similar issues so this is a
driver level issue not a hardware level
issue as far as we're aware so it should
be resolved as driver updates keep going
out and if you still have BSO DS after
updating post information below about
your system config and what's causing
the blue-screen and then we'll send that
along to Nvidia if they need any
additional help on it so as far as other
testing goes
we'll have already at this point a live
stream up so we're gonna be
live-streaming some of our testing of
the twenty series cards that were sent
to us on the defective ones artifacting
issues I will be working on things like
memory down clocking power target
changes may be some disassembly some
thermal testing of memory stuff like
that and before that stream we had
already validated about 9fe cards with
artifacting during the stream which will
have already happened at this point we
will have tested and memory frequencies
power targets and done some disassembly
of cards to find common threads
potentially and of course I mean there's
there's your future perfect tense with a
mix of subjunctive mood for the weak
next up days without r-tx and games 51
or thereabouts depending on this video
goes up so we interrupt this program to
update the ticker on days without r-tx
in games and at 51 shadow of the Tomb
Raider was supposed to have r-tx
features when it launched or close to
launch and it does not presently have
those a battlefield 5 just shipped does
not have our TX features and including
the LSS for any of the games that are
supposed to have those so still tech
demo right now and this is largely
because Nvidia and the game developers
are still waiting on that big Windows
patch which might come back out
eventually after it's done deleting
everyone's files if you didn't hear
about that so once that patch comes out
for Windows 10 the next big update we
should maybe start seeing some r-tx
enablement in games that's been a big
hold up right now and a limitation for
what can be turned on because nvidia
does leverage some of the microsoft
features coming out in that patch for
their r-tx game SDK so so that's it for
that one we're still waiting on games
we're basically but next one seven
nanometer
Rome CPUs and Zen 2 is an AMD news item
Andi has formally announced their
second-generation epic line of currently
named Rome Rome is based on a 7
nanometer process it follows the Naples
launch of epic last year and it's also
got Zen - micro architecture it offers
up to 64 cores and 128 threads roughly
targeting twice the performance per
socket of previous epic CPUs in addition
to a new architecture and manufacturing
process
Andy is deploying a new chip design
approach with Rome and he calls this
approach quote chicklets where by AMD
uses multiple 7 nanometers n2 CPU dies
all connected to a separate 14 nanometer
IO die and these latest generation of
infinity fabric will interconnect the
chip let's and the i/o die
as well as new memory controllers housed
in the i/o die this new approach largely
appears to make manufacturing simpler
for AMD and importantly it's less costly
in regards to chips and interfaces not
everything scales equally with a process
shrink reducing die size though required
to make one monolithic die and instead
making several smaller dies should mean
better yields and lower cost the new
epic CPUs it will be the first CPU is to
adopt a PCIe 4.0 no present word on
availability or public pricing but AMD
is working on sampling select customers
and markets just as a shoe-in here we're
going to be seeing a lot more of this
multi chip module approach to design
going forward as monolithic wafers get
difficult to make the bigger the die the
more expensive it is to make the lower
the yield which also increases the cost
because you have more silicon that
you're throwing away and more time
you're spending on the fabrication line
so M CMS will probably become a bit of a
thing going forward including for Intel
apparently and NVIDIA has also published
white papers on its own thoughts on M
CMS for GPUs in the future so 7
nanometer Vega GPUs get through some of
the rest of the AMD news here for the
week and they also announced the first 7
nanometer GPUs that it's working on and
these are the form of Radeon instinct
they are the MI 50 and mi 60 video cards
of GPUs these are not going to be
consumer targeted devices these are also
enterprise cards they are used for
things like deep learning machine
learning and high compute work
maybe some cloud computing in there as
well the new Radeon instinct cards are
based on TSM C's 7 nanometre FinFET
process and AM these at Vega 20
architecture the mi 60 just as reference
will only use or only support Linux so
it is very much a a scientific grade or
server grade card depending on what you
want to do on it and like the new epic
CPUs these new Radeon instinct cards
will be the first to adopt the new PCIe
4.0 standard the mi 50 and mi 60 can
also be interconnected via AMD's
infinity fabric link allowing multiple
GPUs in a single server the cards are
slated to launch in November on November
18th and there's no word yet on pricing
or availability we have seen some of
those Vega GPUs appear as just the code
names in some benchmarks but keep in
mind that this is not meant to be used
as a gaming device see sonic raising
MSRP see sonic announced that effective
December 1st 2018 all of their china
built power supplies will see a price
increase in US markets this follows
along with some of the tariffs we've
been talking about lately
see sonic attributes these price
increases - what they call quote recent
market developments stopping short of
saying the word tariff and the china-us
tariff or has been setting the stage for
some time now on price increases for
computer components now one thing that
does dodge these is is memory and SSDs
if you look through the whole list that
the the whole US tariffs list memories
not on their SSDs not on there so that
benefits us I guess in one way because
they've been coming down in price a bit
but other components things that can be
considered DIY components for more core
audience so you have cases video cards
motherboards power supplies of course
devices like that those are impacted and
the china-us tariff changes will be
affecting see sonic among the first in
the official MSRP adjustment department
so looking at the affected SKUs they
have a list of them price increases
range from ten to twenty dollars and
many this won't be an insignificant
amount especially at the low end it
becomes sort of nonlinear the way it
scales see sonic maintains that the
solution is dynamic
and will be adjusted accordingly so if
the tariffs increased or decreased so
too will the price hikes also announcing
a new server CPU not to be outdone Intel
has announced its newest line of cascade
Lake Zeon's
and the new cascade Lake Xeon ap or
advanced performance as the initialism
means these CPUs are based on mCP or
multi-chip package designs following
suit of epic and it offers up to forty
eight cores 96 threads with support for
12 ddr4 memory channels big move there
on the memory channel support and this
is kind of interesting because we don't
typically say like AMD did it's been a
while since AMD has been in a
market-leading position and to be first
with a design that has now been adopted
elsewhere by Intel here is it's critical
for Andy's ongoing hopefully success as
they try to challenge the CPU market
segment and really what we need to see
now is some challenging on the GPU
market because any company holding as
much market share as Intel and NVIDIA
have in the past does lead to things
like stricter policies with how media is
approached for example stuff we do and
work with so anyway the design excuse
the monolithic die approach of the
current Zeon's in favor of a multi chip
approach multiple chips and dies on one
package and cascade Lake will have in
silicon mitigations respecter in
meltdown this is important it's one of
the first architectures that we'll have
in silicon mitigations not just firmware
and micro code updates and we currently
are unsure of other specifications for
the CPU so of course the new cascade
Lake chips are based on Intel's 14
nanometer process as 10 nanometer isn't
ready yet and it won't be probably until
2019 the 10 nanometer ice Lake Zeon's
likely won't be here till 2020 following
Intel's present roadmap and that leaves
cascade lake as Intel's a stalwart
defender in the server space against the
am the epic CPUs although Intel's been
doing still just fine in the server
space and in the desktop space they have
a lot of market share port smash and
side-channel attacks being discussed
lately so just as specter and meltdown
are being cleaned up researchers have
found another vulnerability called port
smash port smash is a side channel
attack that targets CPUs using SMT
technology which is bay
we all mainstream CPUs and that includes
both Intel and AMD alongside others like
arm but Intel cause there's
hyper-threading AMD calls there's SMT
it's kind of a brand name versus a
generic name thing same idea though port
smash requires malicious code to be
running in parallel with a legitimate
process on the same cpu core then
through SMT or hyper threading the
malicious code being executed on one
thread can eavesdrop and leak bits of
encrypted data from another thread
allowing an attacker to receive the
encrypted data and reconstructed the
researchers who are based out of Finland
and Cuba said they do not believe this
exploit is unique to Intel in fact
side-channel attacks aren't even unique
to CPUs researchers at the University of
California at Riverside have
successfully exploited NVIDIA GPUs as
well the side attacks and in the case of
GPUs these attacks can be used to
monitor web activity and steal passwords
the researchers are currently delivering
their findings to end video who will be
rolling out a patch to address the side
channel attacks and vulnerabilities
researchers are also in contact with
both AMD and Intel talking about their
findings to see if their respective GPUs
can be affected in a similar way to
Nvidia's the research group now plans to
test the side channel attacks with
Android phones coming up next and we'll
keep an eye on that story because that
would be a certainly a big one since
phones are largely perceived by users to
be impenetrable for viruses and malware
that's obviously not the case SK Hynix
launches at 4 d at nand playing for DHS
with the other manufacturers so SK Hynix
announced its 96 layer 14 and it's
called for D not because it exists in 4
dimensions like you would think it would
mean it's because they use at CTF or
charge trap flash with puck not that one
it's periphery under cell SK Hynix uses
this approach as compared to the 3d
floating gate design and SK Hynix claims
that this is a first and calls their new
memory again for D and then following of
course 3d NAND but there was never a
brand name to team and I guess that
would be planar SK Hynix is at new 14
and will allow chips to be 30% smaller
that's the big thing here and that also
allows them to increase density and
yield considerably thereby supporting
better prices SK Hynix plans to use 14
and to power one terabyte as is DS with
in-house controller designs by the end
of the year with enterprise designs it
slated for 2019 short one here the
Corsair Vengeance 50 180 gaming PC
courses rolling out a new fully built
gaming PC option something that doesn't
excite a lot of our audience but worth
keeping an eye on so Corsair is in a bit
of a unique position when it comes to
pre builds because they can provide most
of the components in fact in this one
course there's got 9 out of 13 of the
components listed made for the Vengeance
51 80 it also uses IQ of course the
proprietary interface software so venden
51 80 will have an i7 8700 9 K it will
also be using a B 360 motherboard
because it's an ankh a CPU I suppose an
RT X xx 80 and an undisclosed 2 terabyte
hard drive option also have a copy of
Windows 10 of course so the 50 180 if
you're curious will be sell sold for
twenty four hundred dollars and is
available now although I mean if you
wanted to know how performs just any of
those individual components for bench
works and then also of course there is
the hydro X series has been more fully
detailed it's been T is several times my
course R at this point has been pushed
back launches have been delayed for this
one but this is course there's open-loop
water cooling solution following the
acquisition of several top talent
members from ek water blocks previously
so Corsair T's the hydro X series at a
gaming event in Paris and also had
information suggesting a CES
announcement for 2019 that'd be just a
couple months from now the leaked images
show a CPU block a GPU block and a
reservoir and pump combination Corsair
has been working on entering the custom
water cooling market for some time after
again acquisition of former ek talent
there for a and do custom loops was only
a matter of time of course there's been
teasing hydro acts on their website
including one video that was like just
the letter X made out of water or
something like that
so pretty obvious with her eventually
released and they also updated the
teaser to show water blocks for the new
Nvidia r-tx
20 series cards and since then there's
been no mention of other products in the
hydro ax lineup so we'll have to keep an
eye out for CES to learn more that's it
