momentarily as always chat let me know
if you can't hear me or something like
that tested it before but hopefully it's
all still working so let me know if you
can hear us we should be live right now
though so and someone is in chat saying
not live yet it's just around a bit of a
delay or they're trolling heavily okay
so man this is some launch huh can you
guys can you hear me can everybody hear
me okay today we are going to be
overclocked in the 28 ET I found Edition
ok cool everyone says they can hear it
and then we're gonna move past that
because I know it's not gonna get me as
far as I want and we're gonna try out
this I actually haven't really done
anything with this yet other than I've
done some photography some b-roll have
started thermal testing but haven't done
any real overclocking so this is the
first of the partner models were gonna
try overclocking I have an Asus one
tomorrow we have some content on that
going live on the Asus model but today
we're going to start with the XC ultra
because to be honest the HP's models and
pieces for a teardown so so we needs
this today but anyway we'll see if that
gets us any further then the founders
edition card did in the review what
pretty far but did not do any any times
by extreme demonstrations and the review
and also we've got actually hardcore
overclock and apparently joined the chat
so welcome bill joy if you don't know
who he is check him out on his own
channel he did the PCB analysis of the
founders Edition how most at frontier
Edition the reference card recently for
our own channel so alright so yeah we're
gonna be doing more video cards stuff
today and Ryan's linking the 20 ATT I
review and chat if you missed it that
went up a couple hours ago I'm gonna let
a couple people file in before we really
start the benchmark so we've got 620
people watching now should go out quite
a bit and then we'll really start
rolling for the advertiser for this
stream we are running thermal grisly who
make the conduct oh not liquid metal
that we've used on several CPUs I
wouldn't recommend it for GPUs but they
do make things like hydro hydronaut and
cryo not for GPUs so we've used a lot of
cryo not on our GPS when we do mods
typically with the hybrid model
and you'll see more of that soon so
that's the advertisers we have a link in
the description below if you wanna pick
up conductin out for your cpu D lids or
hydronaut or cryo not for your GPU
projects or or connection between the
cold plate and the IHS on a traditional
CPU some pretty high quality paste and
thermal interface material from thermal
grizzly alright so lots of lots of chat
in here so far and people still joining
one more note here so those the foil
shirts the one I'm wearing now we have
those up for pre-order quite a while ago
and sold through all the inventory we
could pretty fast in like one or two
streams and we over ordered a little bit
just to account for potential lost and
shipping ones make sure everyone who
ordered one got one in the mail didn't
have any issues with it getting lost so
we ordered some extras for that reason
and for Quality Assurance reasons and
now that all those have made it to the
original customers releasing the
remaining of the limited edition shirts
it's not many of them they should be
gone by the end of the stream and then
we are we're not reordering there are no
more left in stock other than what I've
taken for myself so that's it I mean you
can store that gamers access not know if
you wanna pick them up and you will not
see them available for sale again after
that this is just what's left from our
extras to make sure that people got all
theirs but everyone got them so that's
great because now we have some extras we
can release for those inventory let's
check those out okay so we got a
thousand people in here and I have have
a couple questions Steve can you see
about getting on video to factory
underclock that price I think everybody
has gotten a lot of feedback today and I
am I'm sure that they are aware of the
demand for a factory under clocked price
as you put it on the card so I don't
know I I mean can we just can we just
talk about this launch for a second does
anyone have I don't know press your
thoughts and chat I guess I'll try and
read them as they go by but NVIDIA seems
pretty disorganized on this one which we
said in the review and leading up to
review disorganized is on the media side
disorganized on the public presentations
the charts were on their marketing
charts but they're not even up to Nvidia
zones tentative Marketing charts and
then like basically as
I'm aware there's still a complete lack
of r-tx supported actual games and
things blender is always late to the
punch this isn't an Nvidia problem on
this end but blender takes a while to
update so if they ever update they will
but if they ever update to support RT X
features RT cours things like that will
visit production side of things but as
of today I got southern review we can't
review stuff based on promises and the
promises didn't land so builds lloyd
says they built compute cards and then
rushed to figure out how to sell them to
gamers I yeah I would kind of agree with
that it does seem so it had a there are
two sides to it and I will start
overclocking to say I'm waiting for chat
to file in a bit more two sides to it
that I have in my mind right now
one is the skeptic and on the skeptic
side I see it as like build Zoid said I
see it as how do we how do we how do we
market our lack of a process shrink our
lack of tangible performance gains on
the current architectures how do we take
that take the situation where we're
waiting for a process for node shrinks
and then turn it into a product we can
sell and market it I think the answer
was well what if we take our compute
card technology and figure out how to do
something with it and use our leverage
in the gaming space and our market share
and try and make ray-tracing happen
so that we can sell this product up
until a process track down whether
whether that's ten or seven or whatever
that's one side I see some chat you guys
have to but the other side I'm thinking
is you know for we're trying to give on
video the benefit of the doubt you'd
assume maybe they're actually trying to
advance the industry it would benefit
them to advance the industry it would
benefit them to get away from frame rate
they can already do that pretty well
graphics hardware is now up to speed
with graphics and games so they got to
find something to do so I don't know
there's the two sides I see it as I'm
leaning more towards skeptic right now
we've gotta be honest it seems more like
a marketing thing until I can see actual
games and tangible anything I gotta call
it a marketing play okay so we've got
1,700 people in chat now a couple super
chats then we'll get going on the
overclocking so first one play
Mackenzie $25 Australian I think hey
Steve no one has done anything on envy
link yet do you think you'll give an
overview on that and task for quote
marginal gains yes
I'll leave that there next one pickles
the greatest two dollars any chance of
you doing 1080 is live versus 20 atti
I wasn't planning on doing 1080i SLI
I'll think about it after we look at
envy link but the problem with that is
there's a really kind of selective list
of games that actually do well with SLI
so I'd have to go look at what those are
and then hopefully they also work with
envy link in theory it should I think
it's supposed to all be cross-compatible
but I know the boards are all crossed
compatible with envy link in SLI but
anyway maybe I'm not playing on that one
two more and we'll start Michael Morales
says will you all be comparing that the
EVGA versions versus Nvidia's curious
about the temp comparisons yes we will
be definitely this stream isn't really
the purpose of that the stream is so we
will be comparing the cards for
overclocking I guess in this specific
application but not not thermals today
and core poll capital Wang says $2
patreon doesn't like my credit card so
here you go thank you very much ok and
then Chad's talking about what they
think of the launch so yes it is uh it
looks like most people agree with pretty
much all the reviewers at this point ok
so then let's let's let's get going on
this what we have today is currently a
founders edition card or a reference
card as they should be known in the slot
and that will be replaced to the XE
ultra momentarily so this one huh it's
it's a little worse for wear I did throw
the cooler back on there for this but
it's all good everything works properly
tested it with thermocouples earlier so
no need to worry it's just a little
uglier a little a little scratched up
and then we'll replace that
battle-hardened 2080 ti founders edition
with the XE ultra which is right here in
front of me and that's the first partner
Carter gonna be testing for overclocking
Wow $100 Canadian from DG
the cameras thank you very much DJ the
chemist DJ the count says you're my hero
that is all heart
well you've you've just bought us our
food for the night so you're my hero to
you thank you very much DJ the chemist
we appreciate that very much that's
that's extremely generous of you okay so
is anyone getting is anyone else getting
short audio silence every few seconds is
anyone getting that let me know and it
doesn't count if I'm not talking at that
time also we might have some background
noise from the fans so you're gonna have
to deal with it though okay
so the no no no okay everyone's good all
right cool
so here's a precision Expo my god that's
a lot of notes okay got it thank you
uh-huh here's precision x1 this is the
new software I can't make this any
bigger I don't think so as far as I'm
aware this is the only fully compatible
or the most compatible overclocking
utility that we have right now for the
2000 the twenty series can you see that
okay Andrew do we need to brighten it
okay that's bright in there it's bright
in the monitor a bit so this is going to
be what we're using for overclocking
today I'll run GPZ in the background for
adjust some thermal monitoring and it's
not getting that much brighter but it's
a bit okay is that okay
you got that tall okay all right
yeah we're filming the screen because
the trouble yes someone says I thought
those shirts wouldn't be sold after that
one stream the pre-orders were ending
that stream
we ordered a few extras and the extras
as I said a moment ago were because we
wanted to make sure that none of them
got lost and shipping and everyone who
bought the foil shirts got one and so
now we have them it's it's a couple it's
really not that many so we're releasing
the extras because everyone got theirs
fortunately there were no no packages
that went missing so we released the the
leftovers of that they should be gone
pretty soon I think really not many of
them left and we have not reordered and
will not reorder the design
okay so precision x1 Lots changes here
the main ones I guess this whole
interface has gotten an update you've
probably seen it by some reviewers but
there's a frequency
stepping page now so on the Left we have
frequency on the bottom we have
temperature scales 60 to 90 hear the
throttle points about 87 these days the
hard throttle and up from 83 or four and
this is primarily useful because in
theory you can drag these up to tell it
hey don't drop the clocks until the last
second typically we've seen and so on
the reviews I can't click it it's gone
forever that's it that's gone so from
the reviews least I tracked down below
the Jacob if you're watching from EVGA I
dragged the point below the x-axis and
it will never return yes so some bugs
but anyway in the testing we did for the
review showed that there is a throttle
point at around 69 70 degrees there's
throttle point at around 60 degrees
there's one towards 83 one towards 87 of
course so those are our throttle points
and then we have we're not going to use
this much today this page is just tuning
for fan speed curbs don't care about
that we're just gonna set the max let it
go this is Auto overclocking we're not
gonna use this but it is a volt
frequency scale so you have voltage on
one and frequency on the other and then
the idea is that it can kind of
fine-tune on points of the Volt
frequency curve where the frequency in
the voltage should be but that's not fun
so we're gonna manually overclock it and
then we have memory which this is about
don't brighten the monitor turn our TX
on instead being told well what there's
when there's a I'm kinda a text from
EVGA tell me how to fix that bug when
there's a monitor that supports our TX
on much like a game please let me know
memory goes up pretty high so it will
not actually overclock like this but the
slider goes up to 3000 we did that in
just kind of black screen immediately or
crash or something we've seen most of
these cards doing 800 to 900 but I have
not tested the EVGA one yet and then we
also have the clock scaling tends to be
offset about a hundred to two hundred
megahertz voltage does
do anything it might feel like it it
does I don't know I asked Tom Peterson
from Nvidia on camera I said I'm gonna
give you a chance to prove me wrong why
is the voltage slider not a placebo and
he explained it and it made sense but
man it does not seem to do anything so
we have stepping charts and our reviews
that show why it doesn't really do
anything
power target EVGA has updated their card
they are I think Jacob I think are
watching text me if I'm wrong but I
think they're both reference boards and
the difference here and videos goes up
to 123 percent power target evj updated
their BIOS and it goes up to 130 percent
and it is based off of the same baseline
so it should actually be higher so yeah
that I think that will help us quite a
bit we're getting some extra frequency
there and I'm just kind of checking out
chat between ok so I think I think
that's the whole overview let's default
this and let it run without any changes
is that fin still bugged yes we relaunch
precision just in case and then we're
gonna run a baseline and see how does it
perform base I'll go over the system
specs just so you understand what's in
there and then I'm being told by EVGA
that yes reference for that one 130
percent so yes this is in fact a
reference PCB for the XE ultra that
we're gonna be working with today the XE
to old sure has gone with IEC x2 just
for clarity we don't have that today and
then they will have custom PCB models
coming out shortly but because of Nvidia
slowness in dealing with the partners
that didn't really happen they didn't
get enough information to build their
custom PCBs leaving us with reference
boards for launch and that's about it
but anyway we're gonna focus on x by
extreme today and the reason is I ran
this really heavily for a repeal TT
stream and we use the Titan V in that
one so we'll run it with the CPU test I
guess but then we're gonna turn it off
later and just do only graphics but
let's just run the full thing and I'm
gonna get GPZ open just so we can kind
of keep an eye on what's happening and
it'll drop our score a tiny bit but it's
ok and that will give us some sensor
data at the end of the run just to make
sure we know what's going on okay so
that's gonna go I'm going to give you
some more information here and then I'll
start reading the the chat so on says
the Elric from tackle tomorrow
burned his 20 atti what do you mean by
burned whatever huh
it's it's not scaling properly which
shouldn't affect the score I guess well
well we'll restart that one just in case
it does affect the score the whole
monitor okay there that's kid that's
good good start
so the system we are running an eighty
eighty six K which means I will not beat
the Titan V score I posted previously
for the whole system and we are running
that at 5.0 gigahertz this one does 5.35
we showed that in a live stream
previously but I've got it at 5.0
because the focus is GPU today and I
don't want to fight the CPU our rip LTTE
stream uses two 79-80 XE which has since
become a Miam of what cpu is that and
that score will be unbeatable with this
system but I do want to see how close we
can get so just for reference and let's
let's let's I'll check chat momentarily
and see a lot of it here but let's show
our previous Hall of Fame score let me
let me open this up as a standalone
window okay we can show this let me try
and tilt this monitor over so Angie let
me know if you can get an okay shot of
that so this is the x by extreme list
and can you see that okay now that okay
so what we did was we did a repeal TTA
stream it was a response to Linus tech
tips who are down here ltte benchmark
number 10 and only Canadians in the top
ten I'll give him that
and then so they got 80 92 on Titan V so
1980 XE we came in after them originally
I think we're at fourth or fifth or
something like I don't remember fourth
fifth something in there been bumped
down to seventh Titan V still sorry 980
XE we're not gonna be here today that
was 80 to 85 and the score for that oh
you know I got to give it a shot shout
out to Richie see 77 is one of our
patreon backers went in there and did
his own rip GN within the patreon
discord and I think he was chillin his
Titan V's are pretty cool really fun to
see the community getting involved and
Congrats Richie on beating our score
I'll be back soon to beat yours
that's the fun of it so our score the
Titan V is the interesting one because
it is a predecessor to Torian it was
Volta of course graphics score for that
it's kind of small but it's 7873 where's
our graphics core we are not gonna get
the CPU score today but Sony it's only
three I don't think we're gonna beat
this with a twenty atti I really don't I
think we're I don't know I think we're
to get closer to 7000 but my goal today
I like to set goals for these streams my
goal today is to hit seventy four
hundred points on the graphics core with
overclocking we're ignoring CPU and I
think we're gonna need a board partner
card in order to do that so the goal is
7400 for today for keeping track at home
and Jacob joking via text that maybe you
can beat kingpin score that's that's not
a nice thing to joke about Jacob we know
that's not gonna happen don't have to
rub it in fly them out here though fly
them out here we'll get them on camera
and what we'll do is he'll set up all
the benchmarking systems and I'll push
go and that will allow me to claim the
score so then we can say that I beat his
score via proxy of kingpin himself I
guess but get him out here we'll do a
live liquid nitrogen OC stream or
something with kingpin okay so that's a
lot of talk and I guess you have to
speed though let me check on chat this
is still running its first full pass for
a base line and see kingpin with the
2083 eye does he have a score up there
already twenty eighty I didn't see
actually okay did he
yeah kingpin with twenty yeah so I
didn't say it's not faster than Titan V
I said I don't think I'm going to get it
higher than our Titan V big difference
our Titan B was under liquid this is
under air it's a reference card this one
is also under air its reference PCB and
also I'm not kingpin the guy is like
it's not even fair he's he's he's not he
shouldn't even be putting his names on
the scores at this point the score
should be called Robo clocker his own
robot is beating him so I the Titan V
may well be slower than the twenty ATT
is if you are literally
or you have better understanding of what
you're doing and he is in fact a
professional overclockers so that is not
what I said - thank you anyway okay is
there still a lie a discount a
live-streamed discount for the store we
could do that I guess let me get some of
this go and maybe I'll enable one or
something okay still going here a couple
super chats in quite a few actually mani
v20 atti overclocked or 1080i is in sli
question mark
I don't not 1080i is in SLI I guess is
my only answer to that would I don't
know I haven't tested us-ally in a while
but you're gonna be disabling a lot of
the time and it won't do anything a lot
of the time so I still don't really like
that configuration jack fairly five
dollars do you think there's a
possibility that our TX will never be
adopted in games or decline like SLI it
sure there's a chance in Nvidia has a
lot of market share they have a lot of
engineers who help game developers so
it's possible it gets adopted we already
know it's been worked on it's just none
of them made it for launch so I really
don't know yeah I wish I'd better
insight for you but as a consumer just
wait see what happens if RT x sees wider
adoption you games take years to develop
so it's gonna be a while and I don't
know that I want to be the first person
with one of these cards especially who
knows like when they shrink to 7 or 10
nanometers or something is RT acts even
still gonna be ethane like if it if it
flops now and they can go through a
process rank and change the architecture
and just pack more FP use in there
instead what happens where does ray
chase and go so yeah I really don't know
ok and last Super chat for now that I'm
gonna read hasty of my name is chance
lol do you think Nvidia might be holding
back on performance with drivers till
they move enough Pascal overstuffed
cards I don't think so that's like there
are some conspiracy theories that are
reasonable here I don't think that's one
of them the drivers are going to be more
limited then later on but that's I
really don't think that's because
they're holding back to sell Pascal
I think Pascal saw itself well enough by
nature of being a
portable so now I don't think so I don't
think so on that okay so baseline score
for thermals we weren't getting too hot
here but we have a low ambient
temperature fan speed not going too
crazy what was our max them all here 67
degrees not I you know it's we have
controlled thermal test if you want to
see the controlled numbers it goes
higher than that of course but we're
just doing some ad hoc OC testing today
and max clock doesn't count for much but
1935 before I hit thermal limits and
started dropping to sustain the
temperature targets well to internal the
GPU temperature targets not the one in
precision the the targets we can't see
it drops clocks so we have a chart on
this in the review where it goes down
from like 20 70 megahertz to 20 55 20 40
every couple of degrees and that's part
of that baseline score we got 62 46 for
graphics and remember my goal today is
7400 so we have 1200 points to gain here
quite a bit
big big climb we're asking for and CBO
scores are relevant we're at 4200 - it's
only a 5 gigahertz right now I haven't
really done anything with with the
memory oh then XMP and it's I guess I
should go through that to use the system
specs we're using an asus rog Maximus 10
hero it's our best board for Z 370 that
we have and works well for overclocking
it's the one that got us to five point
three five gigahertz previously using 32
gigabytes for sticks of vengence lpx
memory and that is 3200 megahertz and I
think a CL 16 stock then we have an ax
1600 i quarter power spice we're
certainly not going to run into any
power limits crack in X 62 for the CPU
cooler
I like those for their ease and we have
a little bit of airflow from the CPU
going over the GPU but it's not anything
meaningful it's just from one 140 fan
that's blowing through a radiator for
the CPU cooler so that's going that way
and that's our test bench but anyway so
score I'm gonna take a note of the
baseline and the baseline is 62 46 for
graphics baseline with a 28 et IFP so
I'm just taking a note of that we're
gonna try and beat that as we go and and
that should should get us started so
okay let's let's start overclocking this
thing so first of all
pop-up precision x1 first thing I'm
gonna do we have a full OC test stepping
table in the review I encourage you to
check it out cuz I'm gonna skip a whole
lot of steps right now and start going
towards where I know performance optics
a lot so let's do just something kind of
interesting and see what happens I
actually didn't do this well I I don't
remember the results if I did it was a
long night so we're gonna go to 123
percent power target and I'm just gonna
match the fans here so I apologize if it
picks up on audio and that's it I'm not
changing anything else that will let us
see some volt some thermal frequency
response in testing and we're at 4000
RPM right now in this car this one goes
a bit faster than our other one seems
there's some fan speed variance plus or
minus 10% times by extreme kill the cpu
test don't care about that and let's get
that open I'm gonna pull GPZ on top of
it once it's launched and we can take a
look at frequency versus thermals and
see what happens and then see if our
score is any different this time around
that should be should be pretty
interesting to look at I think so I'm
gonna catch up on chat momentarily and
didn't talk didn't Tom say it's a
one-click overclocked plan hit on a
short stream then yes you can certainly
do that I think that takes 20 minutes
we're not gonna do that today though and
that is something we'll be looking into
I'm sure okay so we got ten dollars
trying to read that one already the real
deal five dollars thank you looking
forward to the MSI and ACS AIB
absolutely we have both of those
actually here and ready to open see JW
dick Eason two dollars I hate to ask but
what cpu are using it is not the 79 a
taxi I don't know if that was what
you're getting at there's an 80 86 K and
I bring this over here
okay so we're currently at 1875 1890
area I have not offset the core at all
so this is stock stock behavior for the
EVGA card is higher on this it's it's
got I think it has a higher factory OC I
don't know or just runs cooler so it
goes higher but boost theoretically
boost 4.0 is on here and video is really
really sparse to the details on 4.0 I
don't know why but it's all it should be
on here
behaves a little differently we have a
flatter current so now we're looking at
something like 15 amps flat right now on
this task for about 15 amps into the
PCIe cables I don't know what the PCIe
slots draw might be more variable and
our frequency is bouncing around high
1800s low 1900s and that's gonna further
drag down as we increase in temperature
but times by is such a short test and
each one of these is 30 seconds no more
than a minute - by short enough that
we're never gonna really hit super high
temperatures which will be greatly
beneficial to us in our scores and then
the fan speeds now at thirty seven
hundred rpm so that's about where it
should be I guess it was at boosting
earlier and let me check on chat from on
let's see someone says I you running a
4k monitor a standard 1080p it's a 4k
monitor but it's at 1080p just because
we're recording the screen and it's
easier to read stuff that way and we can
screen cap but when the card crashes
that typically throws issues so that's
that is a a problem that's why we're
just recording the screen it's bit
easier build so it says yeah the card
will use PCIe slot power for some of its
power it definitely will I'm not sure if
it behaves any differently than Pascal
that builds out if you know let me know
I think PC / probably reviewed that but
I did not look at that and let me double
check on getting some other messages so
frequency right now dipping down to high
17 hundreds in some cases 1800 as part
of this is just the type of test the
workload times by has two graphics tests
one of them is more memory intensive and
I think it's built I'd feel free to
correct me I'm Ron I think is it
graphics test - that's more GPU memory
intensive I think one of them is more
memory intensive and he can correct me
in chat actually hardcore overclocking
look out for him graphics test one I
think is more geometry but I might have
this backwards let me know bill to it
okay 65 18 so what we've done is improve
our score by three hundred points by
doing almost literally nothing not quite
literally but getting close
are you sure you just want to have the
power supply lying on the bottom there
wheeler we learned from the verge that
it can short-circuit that way wasn't
wasn't really sure where that was going
but I I applaud your commentary sir or
madam okay so yeah we've improved by
three hundred points by just increasing
the power target this is not news really
to any of you probably maybe maybe
someone but if you just increased power
target and the fan speed we get benefit
from both of those and these cards are
primarily power limited I encourage you
to check out build Zoids PCB and vrm
analysis on our channel where he talks
about the power limitations and
capabilities of this particular vrm if
you haven't seen it yet
okay let's start doing some pushes here
so I'm gonna go for just a 100 offset
and let's you know what let's let's step
it back we gotta save some for later
let's go to 80 and leave the memory low
until we find a stable core let's run
that and then we're gonna push it in
increments of about 20-25 until it
crashes and the goal here today our goal
is 7400 for graphics core we are
currently at 65 18 that is where we are
right now and hopefully we can hit 7400
I don't know so we've sold it I think we
got a couple of store orders in up I
might try and read those it just depends
on time and how much we have today I'll
I'll try I'm not promising reading the
store orders today but maybe I might
give you a shout out if you buy
something down time okay so we have
let's see
a couple of super chat donations while
this is running you like pop-up gpu-z
too so we can keep an eye on that so
right now 1965 nineteen fifty megahertz
50c which we're at max fan speed 3700
RPM it's about 59 decibels 59 DBA of fan
noise and a noise floor 26 and that's
3,700 rpm so let me read some super
chats now and then we'll get back to the
benching results so for super chats we
have a couple new ones fluffy kitty
three thousand five dollars please
review more cases in the future I'm
still struggling to find one I like I
don't know if it's snowflake in disguise
or what but yeah I think cases are
there's a lot of bad ones have you
looked at so a couple of thought my head
I'm gonna give you a few different form
factor form factors a few different
sizes and types of case Silverstone red
lines here six we liked it a lot for a
cheaper mid tower case that's like a $70
case if you still like them but you
don't want that size case you get a
step-up larger size the PMO one it's
getting harder to find now the PMO too
is a bit of a disappointment in
comparison but the PM 11 if you can find
it was good
the cooler master actually h 509 p that
just flat h 500 is pretty good and ndx
he also has an h 500 that's pretty good
but it is not thermally focused it does
okay
cooler masters does better if I remember
correctly the H 500 P matches pretty
good so I don't know hopefully those
help give you a starting place we have
some reviews up though we are reviewing
more though nori Rivera no come back hit
scrolled up no Farrah $5 Wow Steve just
saw the latest video did Nvidia just
bribe senior and the analyst snowflake
with quote tweezers bundled with their
28 he Ti I guess that's for the rest of
my career I hope to see people referring
to zip ties those tweezers I really I
sincerely do for the next 30 years
that's I hope that's all I see in chat
comments to the point that eventually
humanity just starts calling them
tweezers then they'll have really done
as a favor Israel Garcia two dollars any
20 ATT i2x enemy link review in the work
I already said yes earlier but you might
have missed it so yes just you know give
us a bit Mustain to I'm at five dollars
and I'll check that score a moment
lioness has a video coming out next week
where he takes a forty thousand dollar
computer with 4gb 100 s and tried to
beat the rip ltte score I'm not gonna
read the TLDR because that ruins that
spoils it but that's cool I didn't know
that I guess that's on float plane or
something
so I guess keep an eye out for their
forty thousand dollar computer for TV
one hundred video I have not seen it but
according to my stains by Matt here it's
supposed to be I don't know if it's
response to us but it's supposed to try
and beat our score so I'm really looking
forward to that Linus and team I think
that's probably alex is doing if so
we'll keep an eye out okay so scores max
frequency this time see we stepped up at
all twenty ten megahertz but that is
brief so it's not like it was holding
that it was holding much lower than that
but it does boost a bit based on
thermals and the load the workload sixty
seven oh six our score target 7400 so
sixty seven oh six we were at sixty-five
eighteen with just a one twenty three
percent offset and max fans and this is
with plus 80 megahertz on the core it's
pretty good there and I think think
that's gonna set us off looks like we
actually might have a chance at hitting
7400 but we shall see our Titan V was
seventy eight thirty six if I remember
correctly I don't think we're gonna hit
that it was water-cooled it had shunt
mods on it had a lot of work done to it
but we'll see what we can do today let's
go ahead and boost this frequency up a
bit until it crashes go for 100 right
now time spy
extreme here we go no cpu test this time
and we have also the the beer glasses
finally which I presently have water in
I'm sorry they are actually
multifunctional though believe it or not
so these are back in stock as of last
night they just arrived right in time
for the stream
I bought a decent amount this time we've
been buying a decent nob but they keep
selling the first round sold out and I
think 14 hours which was very unexpected
second round which I ordered like two
times as many sold out in I think about
a week maybe two so we ordered more than
that this time so they are on store dock
gamers nexus net and that's uh that's
let's we'll see if it lasts it should
last the stream I think I think we have
enough to last the stream store that
gamers exit on that they're in groups of
one two or four but discounts for the
higher quantities and also like I said
these foil shirts we had a few left over
just for making sure everyone got there
is none got lost in the mail none did so
now we have extra inventory we're
selling what's left and that's it it'll
be gone the pre-order is previously
almost sold through our entire stock and
we had to cut them off to hold on to the
rest of the foil shirts
the limited edition shirts just to make
sure we actually had some in case like
one went to Australia and never made it
or something so we're releasing that
inventory now it's up on the store if
you want it and let's see super chats
giant dolphin $5 what does our tax mean
for the I'm not gonna read the rest icon
haha $2 message retracted okay thank you
message retracted $5 James love no
message thank you James All American
freedom with a you to 999 dollars thank
you very much doubt my daughter and I
love our GN hats still watching have
been for years I don't think we I don't
know which hats you have but we haven't
sold any for a little while now so we
we've had some discussions about making
more but I don't know how much of our
audience likes it likes hats that's
still running the test by the way so
current score to beat if you're just
tuning in we're at 67 106 points for the
graphic score
our target is 7400 we were running a
twenty atti founders edition card with a
bit of scuffs on it and then we're gonna
be switching to the eg AXI ultra a bit
later once we run into the limits of
this car which should not take too long
on the founders edition cooler and our
scores set 60 706
stock score complete stock 62 46 so
increased quite a bit and we're gonna
keep pushing for that the coaster has
stuck to the cup okay so we are still
running through a second test I think in
time so I wanna see if Oh get he getting
EVGA updates so EVGA responding to my
earlier mention in the stream where he
said sudden kingpin out and he can
proceed to beat his own score and then
put my name on it which I we're not
actually gonna do that fight
so King Ben might come out here we
haven't worked out the details but it
sounds like it is a possibility so
pretty that would be pretty cool if we
got him out he's if you don't know who
he is
he works at EVGA their kingpin cards are
branded with his name so he is an
extreme overclocker and then he works
with a guy 10 who does some insanely
good electrical engineering work and
then I'm also being told apparently
apparently the hybrid will be available
in October so updates for you from them
ok
graphics core 67 12 and all we did was
push a +1 hunt or plus a 20 megahertz
over the last one so we are within
margin of error that is only six points
ahead of the last one that was plus 100
megahertz so we're really not making any
progress with that so it is time to kick
it up a bit more if the card can hold it
let's just go to 125 so it going 25
increments and you know what let's um
let's play around with this voltage
slider some more so it's kind of that's
okay I'm kind of curious
let's do fire strike extreme with the
demo so I can freeze it freeze frame it
windowed mode and let's just move this
slider and see if it does anything it a
frozen freeze frame demo it's hard to
tell when times pie is rotating through
but really doesn't look like it does
anything in our OC stepping chart
doesn't do anything that you can see and
the voltage really didn't change in that
OC step until we started overclocking
the memory in addition to the core at
which point the card mandated that the
voltage would change so
but that's not because the slider it's
just it decided to change it so anyway
let's let's see if it does anything just
really briefly here I'll freeze frame it
somewhere kind of intensive and I think
I know a good frame for that we use a
couple different ones the first couple
are fairly intensive one of these is
normally pretty bad with all the
post-processing like this one's pretty
this is about 15 amps right now through
the card with a stock setup and I forgot
what I want to say goes up the bomb I
can't go off memory but I forget what it
goes up to with the power target boosted
but 15 amps on the stock and voltage is
reading at about a thousand millivolt
trips or 1 volt roughly assuming this is
accurate let's boost that to offset of a
hundred and apply and I don't think it's
it's so it's not all I shouldn't say
that it's not offset of a hundred it is
a 100% slider just doesn't have a unit
of measurement in there but I don't know
I mean it's not really like it's it's
hard to see if it's actually changing I
think in theory and Tom said this in the
interview in theory it's supposed to
just tell the car like hey it's okay to
be in the maximum voltage state all the
time but it seems like it's doing that
anyway and I don't know if that's
because the power target or because the
workload or the overclocking or what but
it really doesn't seem like this does
anything and I think builds ride as
probably said something similar in his
own content will max it out anyway
though because it's not like it's going
to over one volt and these cars are
lower voltage than previous Pascal card
so it kind of makes sense
anyway times by extreme let's do another
one of these with a 125 offset we'll
start doing memory soon and see if we
get any progress towards our goal of
7400 points for today we are at 67 12
right now okay
and that's going up okay all right so we
got a couple super chats here we got
Dalton Pete $10 I have a cryo reg c7 see
you with a Dan case a for SFX what could
I do other - what what else could I do
it's get more clearance from the
sidewall other than getting a new fan ah
and Patrick was that if he can even hear
me was that Dan case a four is that the
one you were looking at the other day I
don't know if he can hear me
anyway we were looking at some damn case
cases the other day he might be
listening to the stream he'll hear me in
30 seconds and the their small I don't
know that specific model I really don't
so I don't know I don't know what you
can do for clearance it's a small case
yeah yeah is it the a for SFX
so that's the super small and you saw
yeah someone's asking how to get more
clearance from the sidewall no I guess
we're looking into it I don't know so
maybe like I don't know I don't know
what the plan is
okay here's the case so this is the rise
in tech affion video they put standoffs
right there Ryan's active side panels
and I think the Dan case has like snaps
the side panels but you could consider
doing something like that
okay potential a standoff I'm sure you
can find it just like a piece of
circular piece of plastic online
somewhere try and shove that in there I
I'm not familiar with the case but
that's an idea to consider and okay
other super chats Zachary sweets what
cpu are you testing testing GPUs so I
found a loophole for your meme 8086 k2
Dave you're actually curious 5 gigahertz
on that so it's not heavily overclocked
Paul Hawk 10 PLN do you think RTX will
go the way of physics I don't know it
certainly could and Vinnie's got a mixed
track record here they've done some
really good work with some of their
technologies and making them actually
adopted they've also got things like VX
AOM FAA that were cool in concept but
never really went anywhere if I remember
correctly I think maybe Rainbow six or
what was that game there was like that
failure of a game hey which is not not
helping I can't remember the name of it
there's some like dystopian short-lived
MMO and I I want to say it wasn't Tom
Clancy game something with a D I don't
know I can't remember it I think that
had vxa oh and I can't remember any
others so yeah I don't know I guess oh
yeah Batman had like some stuff too I
guess if you want vision division that's
it I think there's the division thank
you
division yes chats following up with a
division now yeah that one I think had
one of those Nvidia attack graphics text
in it and I can tremendous so will our
TX go the way of physics there is a
track record for yes and no and everyone
I've spoken to at Nvidia and I don't
mean marketing people I mean people
further into the company seem to believe
that our TX is getting more effort
behind it than some of the previous
technologies it has more development
focus they are working with game
developers more heavily you've got an
SDK out that's been out since GDC now
it's not new tag so it's possible that
this could be more like game works I
don't mean that as a pejorative I mean
more like game works insofar as game
works has pretty whether you like it or
not has pretty wide implement a
games so they're kind of pushing that
angle with it and if they work with the
same developers then it might have a
wider spread just it's how long until
that's a thing and the games that you
care about because it's select games
kind of like a Sal I
yeah where's great when it works and
then it really sucks when it doesn't so
yeah I don't know the answer but we have
to look at history and I am skeptical
enough that I would be hesitant to
recommend a purchase today in fact I
would not recommend the purchase today
but see r20 atti review four instances
where there might be a good purchase for
you it's just for general gaming
audience not recommended so I can't
recommend it based on promises and it's
it's not it's not used in icing so it's
a promise that's it 6809 graphic score
for that run we're offset 125 megahertz
on the core zero on the memory presently
and that's 6809 for graphics and we have
let's see we have surpassed our previous
score by a bit so we were at sixty seven
twelve or go up slowly but surely goal
is 7400 today and I'm not sure if we'll
achieve it or not
let's see Oh Oh what is this can I show
this I just got a text
Manny Vijay really capitalizing on this
stream to market their stuff but I mean
hey it's okay this one's kind of cool
I'm not gonna blame them for head it's
it's interesting here is a world
exclusive picture EVGA NV link bridge
okay world exclusive apparently let me
blast the brightness on my phone
hopefully you can see it and let's get a
zoom in there
thank you very much Jakob presenting
that over
I got a OBS open too so I can see if you
can see it so apparently this is a world
exclusive which I don't know wow it's
how much that really matters but hey you
got to see it on to be link bridge right
there so there you go that's EVGA is
evey J's world exclusive that all were
worth Jacob a picture of an NB link
bridge it's cool it's got LEDs in its
dip
with them and video on I'll give you
that but come on I'm asking for a little
more here like I don't know what about a
what about Ken bin card send me a photo
the kingpin card then we'll talk okay
all right so we've got so hey I like
that calm we've got some comments about
their thing we've got a mix so I'll read
them both
Jacob keep your ears open we've got a
pogchamp it's not really helpful battery
not really helpful but ok cylon not
really helpful but i guess it looks like
it looks like a Cylon I guess I can see
that we've got a looks good EVGA we have
ugly really emphasized we have nice we
have it's a Protoss ship I would agree
with that as well so it's good mix if
you're going for sci-fi I guess you've
got Cylon and Protoss so maybe lean into
the sci-fi theme of that one alright you
already have that 80s anniversary thing
maybe maybe it all works out go for the
Far Cry blood dragon approach was a fun
game alright so 6809 was our previous
score let's go ahead and boost this to
150 offset on the core so all I'm doing
is boosting that core up by another 25
megahertz
I agree looks ugly it is like the 1980s
I mean even Jay is doing that design
lately it's coherent at least cohesive I
should say cohesive design aesthetic so
we got I got a about an even mix of ugly
and good and sci-fi okay 150 offset
that's her new push not doing a through
the memory until this crashes and fails
okay let's run that one what's our peak
clock not that it means much what with
the boost 4.0 behavior
20 40 megahertz was our peak at one
point never holds there but that was a
peak our peak peak actual peak was 21 15
and testing for the review no 2104 this
card 2120 115 for the 20 80 and did not
hold of course but it was perfect the
perfect app was power so that was our
limitation for the review with the f e e
BJ thanks for the exclusive looks good
good looking for me okay well cool we've
got a got a good mix Jacob yeah I don't
know how you deal with it making
products like that just like what he
even do if it you release something
everyone asks for then they all all the
people who didn't ask for it say they
hate it and all the people who wanted it
don't say anything then the inverse next
time alright so some some more
housekeeping stuff here we have as a
noted couple store mentions as this is
running its clock testing we have the
beer glasses back in stock and how's it
goin G awesome beer glasses back in
stock the end of the cobalt blue glasses
they've been really popular sold out
twice I ordered more this time I think
they'll make I'm 99% positive they'll
make make it through the stream but feel
free to challenge me I guess gold rim on
it and blue with the GM teardown logo
like the one on the shirt here the foil
shirt so these are I probably almost
gone at this point some sizes might be
gone I don't know I've been checked but
like I said if you're just joining we
had these up as a pre-order limited time
thing all the pre-orders flew through
our inventory faster than expected and I
cut off the pre-orders left the
remainder of the order so that we could
look for any lost shirts
none of those got lost in shipping so
that was great and now we've released
the rest of the inventory for people who
don't like pre-ordering things because
hey I don't blame you we certainly
didn't recommend pre-order in the video
cards that coming out recently so we had
some leftover people who just want the
straight order it and get it within a
couple days anyway those are up on store
dock gamers nexus net there should be a
link below this time
yes there's a link below stored I gave
him sex done that anyway 150 offset
right now and I'll get the super chats
and one second here our new peak is
twenty eighty five megahertz but that's
up from twenty forty so we have gone up
here and let's see a couple more
questions hang on what are these any
update on the smaller mod map the
smaller mod mat is should be on the way
for a sample so we have another sample
coming in so no no no updates yet we're
still trying to get a sample and that's
actually like perfect and that's always
a high goal to hit but take some time we
can get there once we approve the sample
start making them what CPU were testing
got that one LJ with no K says to two
dollars thank you very much what's the
goal score for today 79 80 very good
very clever I see you though not gonna
get that past me no in fact the goal is
7400 and we are at 68 68 right now for
the score so I'll take a note of that
that is up from 6809 previously what's
up I don't think we did saw a lot of the
shirts I think there's still a couple
there it may be in one size yeah no I
don't think so
let me double-check no yeah they're
still there
I think I don't know I think they're
there anyway
68 68 and that is let's see 6809 was
previous small gains got a way to go
we're starting to run out of it was he
headroom though so i don't know if we
can hit 7400 with this card but we do
have the eega card as backup
sure EVGA there represe been texting me
is probably waiting very eagerly for
that to go in alright so that's a couple
more super chats and then I see
screenshots
so our super chat and we'll bump it some
more
ie Odie's $5 thanks for the awesome
coverage come on over to Mountain Creek
Bike Park we can ride in that place from
wireless BR cutely could work I'll pass
on the VR but I'm happy to do some
riding I've heard a lot about Mountain
Creek bike park I think that's in New
Jersey used to be called was it a Diablo
Diablo and then they changed the name
because that scared people
so yeah I'll probably some point I
typically go to like snowshoe or Bryce
for downhill biking and yeah maybe
Mountain Creek once I get up further
north at some point when there's not a
launch every month of the year that
would be great and one more Kris cuz law
Kozlowski $20 so I note that the 2080 is
nearly 300 millimeters squared larger
than the 1080 core according to TR up to
six of these 72 multiprocessors are
disabled i-20 atti has 68 out of 72 SMS
enabled I'm sorry missing 256 of the
possible FP use 64 times when I say it's
68 out of 72 right yes 68 out of 72 so
64 times for 256 so you have 256
possible more FP use that you could turn
on which I don't know if that's gonna be
a Titan or just for yield purposes they
give a buffer to d6 FP it or CUDA cores
that you prefer it's not really enough
for a Titan I don't think but they can
do it and they enabling the extra SMS
would give them another memory
controller which would give them the
capability of adding another memory
module so they could I have 12 memory
controllers instead of 11 I check our
architecture content for that if you
curious to learn more and then 12 was up
thunder 12 it would potentially open up
some machine learning deep learning
applications but I don't know if they're
gonna do titan but your question was not
that your question was do you think high
prices are due to low yield I don't know
if they are due to that specifically but
the prices are certainly higher because
of the yield as a die as Annie silicon
gets larger you
you will become limited on your your
ability to drop the price it's really
expensive to make a big dye yields are
bad so yeah that's that's part of the
problem certainly for the price the rest
is probably because there's no
competition and video is competing with
themselves okay we need to run this
again
so let's see if it'll survive 175 this
is where we get into territory I'm not
sure how it will do because for a short
test it's possible that this will
survive whereas for the the longer like
actual game benchmarks this this these
clocks do not really make it they kind
of die and also the offset here so
offset that is not like you can't just
say 175 mega Hertz offset and apply it
to all games as if it's it's plus 175
mega Hertz because it is offset from the
frequency that the game is pushing the
card to run at so that some games you
might get a lower frequency naturally
than others that's something we've seen
certainly in the past and and that can
be a limiter of performance as well you
twist the for the blinds thank you
alright so this is running and our peak
is still 20 85 we haven't gone up on
that that is again peak is not really
great metric of anything it's just
showing us is what we're doing working
and then you're hitting power and
thermal limits after that okay
so what can we learn here current perf
cap reason 20 and gpu-z
is power no surprise and I was surprised
limited by power so the EVGA card will
give us an extra 7% power should help
the boards can handle it the PCBs can
handle it if your hands can handle it
so we can switch that once we're out of
room here goal today seventy four
hundred points four times by extreme
current score to beat 68 68 previously
we had a score of 62 46 was our baseline
so 62 46 was what we got with full stock
setup with just the we're talking just
graphics score here so full stock out of
the box card performance with the out of
the box thermals of course and 65 18 was
the next bump so that was drive that
three hundred point difference was
derived from a power target offset to
123 percent from one hundred and maxing
the fan speed which gives us more
thermal overhead as well for boosting
because boost behavior is contingent
upon the temperature of the GPU diode or
what reads the GPIO dinery and then the
next score is 67 over six that was plus
80 megahertz then we hit a we stagnated
with plus 100 megahertz at 67 twelve
within margin of error definitely 6809
now that was that plus I think was that
125 then we hit 68 68 with plus 150 and
now we're at plus 175 and eventually we
gonna hit a wall and have to figure out
what to do to hit our 7400 goal because
we're running out of room fast okay
Chris carrier five-dollar Steve any
ideas when the EVGA 20 atti hybrid will
be released and currently I'm using an
EVGA 1080i hybrid and want to upgrade
when it comes out so I guess that's why
hey come sent me that message she wasn't
just shamelessly marketing this product
she was answering your question but I
got them out of order so his answer was
the guy from EVGA the hybrid available
in October and says it's gonna be an ace
tech Gen 6 pump with an asynchronous
radiator and card fans that's actually
really good news
so Gen 6 pump doesn't matter if
honest Gen 6 is like some slight
improvements to the Wow they have an
improvement to the Impaler the Impaler
is way better we have a teardown of
course there's H 150 I Pro or whatever
it's called and if you look up our
coarser H 150 I tear down you can see
the differences of Gen 6 and Gen 5 and
the Gen 6 a Sutekh gen 6 pump is
primarily an impeller change and changes
to the permeation permeability of the
tubes of the the way the loop is
constructed so there's some changes
within the block of how the water is
routed but other than that it's not like
there's a performance improvement so
that's kind of a downside but endurance
maybe is better it's hard to know
without testing for you know without
years of sample data anyway the rest of
it sounds like a pretty big upgrade and
then asynchronous radiator fans would be
good because otherwise they're way too
loud and the EVGA has done that for a
while so it sounds like they're fixing
that that's good the score 6874 man
we're stagnating hard on this can I have
to change cards pretty soon I think 6874
that was plus 175 is not a great not a
great improvement we need to start
pushing the frequence the memory at some
point but I do want it to crash first so
that we know that core limitations
within this particular benchmark do 200
offset no other changes here so fans are
100% that has them at 3700 rpm they are
in fact asynchronous with we get a
zoomed in shot on this software I guess
but asynchronous for this this founders
edition card which is interesting to me
because he BGA kind of started that with
icx and I thought they had patents on
some of this stuff I don't know how any
of that works but I don't know what the
deal is there anyway and video decided
to chew into that market and do the same
thing they are not using them however
and as far as I'm aware the fans seem to
lockstep with one another so your GPU
and your power fan spin have the same
speeds all the time and the power fan
will be the one on the right GP is the
one on the left so I don't know that
they're really leveraging this it looks
like it's more of a user thing
200 offset let's do that
run custom okay all right so I am going
to you I'm gonna read some non super
chat for a minute let's make sure we can
uh let's see I need to catch up on a
couple other messages to all right so
non super chat I need to catch up on let
me ask you all something this is this is
just for everyone in chat not you don't
have to pay to answer this question I
want to know I should pick a specific
question I guess so for people who have
watched not just ours but other r-tx
reviews what's the what's the general
consensus on it let me know because you
here's here's my timeline I was up until
about two and a half hours before launch
so full day working on it
set it to publish went to sleep woke up
at 9:00 checked it made sure published
went to sleep woke up bit later made
like 12:00 12:30 and then got back to
work so I have not really I checked
Linus's review which actually I really
liked the things they had to say on
there it's great to see a heavyweight
like large-size channel like that has
someone on Twitter earlier I said it's
great to see a heavyweight channel
saying whatever they said sometimes
whatever are you calling - fat no no I'm
not
it was good to see them like come out
and actually call out the issues I
really it whenever you have a lot of
media pushing the same point I think it
gets the message to the manufacturer in
a way that is more impacting than if
it's just like a couple outliers because
then it just looks like people who are
too demanding and for an enthusiast
crowd we might be too much demanding the
lioness represents a really large
audience and to see him be critical of
RT X I thought was good so I saw his I
saw Jays I haven't really watched the
other so let me know that in the normal
comments just what's the general
consensus I see a lot of them right now
so let's see I'm seeing too expensive
I'm seeing no by 2080 Ti is a Titan too
expensive
it's good but not really practical for
consumer needs I yeah I like the Linus's
review with the 48 ports which with the
boxes in the pack has good to 70 percent
increase in price for 30 percent
performance gains nope you keep it
that's that's sort of what we said not
worth it at all don't buy okay so I
don't know how much of this is your
consensus
what is the okay yeah yeah okay so it
looks like people generally agree on the
I'm not seeing many counter points to
this I suppose the counter point would
be maybe if you're a game developer
getting it early is beneficial to you if
this takes off because then I mean you
have it early you can start building
games sooner so yeah a developer's card
a couple people are saying I would agree
with that as well
very interesting okay well thanks for
keeping me up to date on what happened
in the world today
don't bow it too expensive I think a lot
of reviewers didn't trash it someone's
saying okay cool alright so 69 47 SR
score that was with a 200 offs that were
gaining in a bit I monitor on the stream
machine decided to go to sleep give me a
second there
69 47 so we are finally getting closer
to 74 hundred six nine four seven that
was plus 200 okay so score is an order
where I'm just gonna blast room we
started 62 46 65 eighteen sixty seven oh
six sixty seven twelve that was bad one
6809 68 68 68 74 69 47 goal at 7400
our Titan V previously hit something
around 78 36 I don't think we're gonna
beat that but you know we might as well
go ahead and see it's not gonna be my
goal today though do you need to do
memory overclock I don't know when this
thing's gonna crash like what's the deal
I might see a performance increase stop
or decay or diminishing returns before
we see a crash but that shouldn't be the
case so our max clock on this now is
twenty-one thirty megahertz which is
higher but again that is a peak that's
like that could be a millisecond and I
think this logs on the second so a
second
of time it doesn't it's not sustained 21
30 more realistically we are like 100
megahertz below that I think we're
probably at 2060 2070 I'll keep an eye
on it this run just to get an idea for
sustained average frequency okay died
well clock for this run 300 megahertz
okay
it did jump to 20 205 which is the
highest I've seen so it did hit 2.2
gigahertz for about a second and then
instantly died does not count that does
not count as a successful robotics
Javadoc back down to 200 we need more
power Headroom we hit the perf cab I
think oh we hit V rail also okay couple
things going on so let's go back down to
200 offset that was stable last time
hopefully remain say well I'm going to
jump this memory to just plus 800 and
see what happens this has a big push
let's see if it survives this one okay
bill on chalo good to see you around
again 20 bucks no message thank you bill
on cello bend quickly two dollars would
you ever consider selling a long sleeve
tops or shirts we we have hoodies but I
haven't done just like a straight
long-sleeve shirt so I could consider it
I don't know how much the man there is
certainly would always consider that
stuff but we do have just normal hoodies
anyway Jason Christoph $15 I'm curious
if I'd never tweeted at you The Verge
video if this whole calamity would have
ever happened so Jason Christophe having
an existential crisis right now
wondering if I never tweeted that video
at gamers Nexus would the verge have
undergone five days of crushing horror
from internet commenters I know what
it's like it sucks but I don't know also
they took stabs at all the youtubers
before so I guess what comes around goes
around but yeah if it was you who
tweeted at me and that's when i
retweeted it and was like oof
then yeah that's I think Kyle saw that
tweet bit with Kyle and then it just all
went downhill from
so don't blame yourself too much they
were the ones that called zip ties
tweezers after all you can only take so
much credit andrea tames 499 2080 or
1080 t is Li I already have a 1080i
we've gotten that question a few times I
guess I should have considered doing
that in the review or something I am
still not recommending a 1080 T is li
configuration I haven't tested it in
like a year okay so if there's more
recent data that says ex allies great
now it works in most games it's never a
problem no micro stutter everything
works perfectly then by all means you'll
read their stuff and buy based on their
so I haven't tested in a year but I
tested it basically like every month for
a year previously checking scallion it
was never good so there are games that
do really well with SLI they definitely
exist there are games that do 2x scaling
their games that do have scaling and the
negatives games with your micro starter
the games don't know what it is
so I can't recommend SLI I don't know if
envy link might be different I don't
know finn's finess k3 $10 thank you very
much
pretty disappointed with RT X I have
four water-cooled 1080p eyes and haven't
seen anything yet on SLI 420 series I
guess 10 series will still own the Hall
of Fame yeah I mean I think most people
are pretty pretty disappointed with r-tx
I would say that is a fair statement for
sure alright we're still running over
here with now a memory offset and the
core offset and we do still I think have
some of these shirts left it looks like
so does it seriously say sold out on
there
Add to Cart okay that's correct okay
cool it looks like it's all fixed all
right cool
the button was wrong the shirts are in
there so we have a couple of them left I
think like the button action I said sold
out from when when I had it as locked
the pre-orders because people bought
them all and we were gonna run out of
our extra inventory for like QA Quality
Assurance stuff like that so they're
still there they don't store it at
Gabe's next on out the few that were
listed earlier I think someone went and
fix that button thank you very much
okay so 7103 there we go goal is 7400
getting there
we started out the the lowly score of 62
46 and we're now at 70 103 that's with
plus 200 and finally a memory offset of
plus 800 which puts us at what is that
7800 and then you multiply by 2 so
that's that's a good start let's see if
we can do 900 let's see what it can do I
think it was dying around this point in
most of our games so we had the step
down the OC from what its maximally
capable of run that okay
oh yeah our distributor messaged me and
said you got a text override on the foil
shirt button I changed it for you
because people didn't know they could
buy all right thank you very much sir
okay so that's all fixed yeah they're
the couple we we had leftover in there
and then we're we're done with hump
laughter no more on order they're just
leftover from the first batch and then
we're moving on to other strip designs
so if you want one or if you want of our
blue beer glasses they just came in last
night store that cameras next to Staton
that for those okay so nine hundred
offset on the memory its GDR six mind
you this behaves a bit differently from
G five acts and we are approaching
sixteen gigabits per second that's
pretty cool
stock is like 14 I think clock we're at
plus 200 we're crashing at 225 I can
maybe try 210 later something like that
of a really desperate
so we're averaging around 20 44 20 55
for parts of these scenes but then it
drops down we're at 2000 hours it all
depends on the scene and the temperature
the temperature here we're at 54 degrees
so we have measured starting to see
clock drops this is under boost 4.0 it's
similar to 3.0 we started seeing clock
drops in the 50s previously that would
be this over here is our temperature it
looks like we crashed too and then we
see them again in the 60s we see them
again in the 70s so drops at least once
if not twice every group of 10 degrees
okay so that did not succeed so 900 no
good let's see if it does 850 start
narrowing down our range of supported
clock frequency if you want to follow
along at home you don't need RT X to do
this of course you can do this on older
cards some of the AMD cards are the most
fun to overclock and videos lock those
down for quite a while now it's actually
rather sad especially on the voltage
side they claim it so that people don't
kill their cards I could potentially
agree with that or understand that I
should say not agree with it I can
understand why they would say that but I
I do not agree with the decision and
would like to see how mocks voltage and
I'm like to power targets because the
board can handle it anyway if you want
to play along at home you can grab
3dmark they have a free version it's
just this is really good benchmark in
software they were free version that you
can use just to see how yours
and compare your score to other scores
on their Hall of Fame's you look up the
three more Hall of Fame or Hardware bots
they both have score tables it's a lot
of fun if you haven't done it before no
real risk with these cards until you
start opening them up and stuff like
that
doing shunt mods whatever up until that
point no real risk so it may be worth
your time to grab afterburner precision
or some other OC software and have some
fun with it
if you want to play along for the
weekend with our OC testing and I mean
as you can see the streams this is
really what I'm doing here is not
difficult this is a a consumer-friendly
approach builds or does more extreme
stuff though and we'll get into some
liquid cooling stuff not liquid nitrogen
but liquid cooling maybe dry ice one day
to beat Richie C's score on the Hall of
Fame 850 s holding and we'll see if it
survives the same spot that died and
last time I questioned whether it will
okay super chats so last one was from
Jason who had an existential crisis
about whether or not is alerting me of
the verge video had changed the course
of history and the next C which had mr.
I'm Andrew alright got that one fin
squee got you is that Kenny if I'm
missing any of these I'm sorry I'm I
think I'm getting them all I'm keeping
it like scrolled to the same spot is
that Kenny $5 when will the Mod mats be
back in stock just ordered mine the
large one that's like the one that's on
the table right here this mod mat I
guess the only one it's all right now is
already on the way I think it's on a
plane in the US at this point so it
should be what's today Wednesday I think
should be arriving to us towards the
weekend most likely maybe Friday and
then they'll immediately start shipping
out to anyone who's bought one so he
bought a mod mat on the store they will
begin shipping and these these get back
ordered all the time because it's really
expensive to make them we're not like a
huge manufacturing company so I have to
make them in runs and obviously you know
you need to take the money image from
previous run to fund the next one so
they go on backorder but we have not
sold through them for this round so if
it's still on the store listed
backorder item or add the card item then
you can get it for this round coming in
this weekend okay thank you for the
question man lots of questions here
today and I'm trying to catch up but
also trying to do overclocking I don't
have a crash or not okay
where where was that question okay here
it is All American freedom well make
them regarding the hats I think I bought
two of the blue and white ones black
with a shiny blue is what my daughter
wanted me to ask you for we can look
into it we look it's a hat certainly
we've been talking about it
sleepytime 10 bucks thank you much no
message and all American freedom again
20 bucks well thank you very much and
another one to my nine-year-old
understanding everything you are saying
that's a I mean I I want to say that's
impressive without sounding like I think
what I'm saying means a lot because it
really doesn't but if you're nine and
you're like following along taking notes
like okay okay plus 850 megahertz plus
plus 200 on the core that that
nine-year-old is gonna kick ass kingpin
better watch out that's pretty cool okay
so 22 or 505 was there still max o'clock
we're not hitting that anymore that was
just before it crashed 8:50 was stable
so this is about where we're gonna get
stuck so we're gonna it's talked about
at 71 20 we need to switch to the EVGA
card now I think we've done we've given
the founders edition enough attention at
this point it really doesn't deserve
this much let's move on to EVGA s let me
just save this as scores for a live
stream just so I can keep track of what
we're doing so I'm gonna shut this down
71 20 we're like we only care about
graphics core let's let's shut that down
and switch the EVGA card I'll do a quick
driver wipe that won't take too long
just to make sure we have clean drivers
for this and this is the benefit of
having actual space in our new office
because I guess because Andrew can roll
the tripod partly too but I this this
would have really sucked to do
previously so okay we're just going to
switch the car this is the beat-up
founders dish in
but it has been thermally restored the
Shroud however will remain I think it's
even on upside-down er is that upside
down maybe I don't know
I think the Shroud might be on or the
nameplate might be upside down but also
the name plates stupid so let's get that
EVGA card in there is extra thick still
a meme so that's still a thing people
say cuz this one 2.7 slots or 2.75
something like that
definitely a phat card it's got a bigger
cooler on it that will give us more
temperature overhead or a Headroom I
should say so temperature as I've been
saying is a huge impact of clocks with
this architecture and Pascal especially
we're on boost 4.0 of these days and we
need to eight pins so I've got that all
hooked up just need to clear drivers
with ddu and if you don't know what DTU
is it's always kind of hard to tell what
the general like level of understanding
is for our audience I think it's pretty
high so most you probably know what DTU
is but if you don't know what it is it's
a free software that just blasts drivers
it's really good at making sure you
don't have any driver crowd left over
that screws up your future installations
and then we're gonna install the new
ones
okay so ebj tells me 2.75 inches thick
th icc so i guess it is in fact still a
meme anyway that's the card I've got a
current clamp here I don't know I don't
think we'll use it maybe we'll use it
towards the end but that will just let
us clamp the 12-volt cables if we want
to see what kind of currents going
through those maybe towards the end if
there's interest so current score 70 120
yes what the founders edition card and
we need to just d2u this now
so didi you safemode okay all right so
while this is wiping drivers and we
install some new ones I'm going to read
a few more these comments let me go back
to normal
just straight chat there's no super chat
for a minute hello chat how's it going I
like thick GPUs okay well chat hasn't
changed see there's one constant in life
it's not not gravity not the speed of
light it is that chat will devolve into
memes and yep there's a lot of extra
thick comments okay well it was worth
checking all right how how come everyone
has the EVGA cards I don't know they
shipped a lot of them I guess we have we
got Emma sighs like today I think we got
gigabyte we got a ACS we have we've torn
that down already and we just need to
put some thermocouples on it start doing
thermal tests maybe tonight so that
teardown will go up very soon tomorrow
so I checked the teardown frase uses
card tomorrow but yeah all right so what
else what else is check out for me while
we're cleaning the dryers and installing
new ones someone's saying it should be
73 hundred plus for the score with EVGA
overclocks I hope you're right I'm going
for 7400 I don't know if we'll hit it
but I think it's just they've barely
outside a reach so I'll see what we can
do
mighty liquid cooling to really do it
that RGB implementation on the EVGA GPU
is quite a joke
ouch no skin off my back but EVGA has
gotten a lot of really gotten a lot of
flack for that design when they showed
it at Gamescom it's like people did not
like that acrylic people also didn't let
her polycarbonate I think I guess maybe
see anything but people also didn't like
their their FCW 3 designs either that
one kind of grew on me Steve is
disappointed in us are any of the cards
of the custom PCB I don't know I the yes
yes there are the Aces one the Strix one
that I have that's a custom PCB I think
pills working
PCV analysis of that one for our channel
so we'll have discussion on it and
teardown and testing and all that stuff
so yeah that's that is I don't know if
the Emmis I when I got is or not okay
just inside the drivers now so boring
stuff but it'll be done soon we get back
to overclocking so we if you've just
joined you just came back we've switched
cards from a very abused scuffed-up
28 ET I found his Edition the famous one
problems video where I had to blast a
heat gun at it and pry it the plate is
that oh no it's it's become glued again
so that one has just gone through
testing here with overclocking and it's
about 70 171 20 points so we're going
for Saudi 400 points there we go okay
you ready Andrew you have your safety
goggles on so there's the plate that was
glued on if you missed the video that's
what you missed man what a pain this was
to take apart I think the count official
count was over 70 screws so the going
theory from comments seems to be and I I
kind of agree with it at this point the
going theory seems to be that Nvidia
went for one screw per r-tx op so I
think that is how they decided I
wouldn't put it past them it seems like
the kind of small attention to detail
they do just see if anyone noticed I so
that's the glue that's left over PCB
it's gonna LED controller on it cabling
for the fans RGB LED for the top that is
actually just green and I don't know if
it has anything else on it but like I
don't know if as I'm see use or anything
like that so that's the card we just
used other way is this right side up or
upside down this is upside down okay
relieve NIT that way just to annoy
everybody alright so they read a couple
more of the normal chats unexpected
delivery delay email from Nvidia on my
twenty atti someone says it's that just
because of like weather or is that
because they I know they sold out of
them
okay I just got here
do you think some of the larger 20
series cards aces will be able to
physically fit SLI on an average x4
sounding board I yeah I guess so
2.7 slots it's not impossibly large
it's pretty damn big so we have a 2.7
slot card here let's get a shot of this
Andrew so we have a 2.7 slot card over
here and this one if you kind of just
imagine having another one it would work
I mean there's you gotta put it there so
how are you gonna put it that you can
put it here if your PCIe slot lines up
oh no I'm touching the components of the
computer while it's on and the verge
said that these have several hundred
Watts running through them so this is
you could put it there I guess there's
enough space for it to kind of breathe
but you're really handing down the case
and make sure you don't have a power
supply shroud I guess that'd be my only
advice to you and make sure your PC I
use the slots are very widely spaced
okay so the drivers are done installing
we can restart now and start
overclocking the EVGA card just to the
founders edition all right limited
edition upside down founders Edition 20
80 T oh that's what we've created
apparently okay let me go back to super
check this is rebooting right now it's
finalizing the driver install quick
update for everyone going through all
these over and over again but original
score 62 46 target score 7400 and times
by extreme so we started very far away
from the target over a thousand points
away and currently we're at 70 120 with
this thing and that was with a plus 200
core offset and plus 850 memory offset
and now it is time to see if EVGA is
additional seven percent power can get
us more points and times by extreme so
that's this thing right here the power
target slider goes up to 130 I'm gonna
run the test default first though get us
a baseline see where it performs
natively but you can see here 130 offset
so it does go up a bit higher
that should help time spy extreme let's
do a let's do a full run just do a full
around and see what the score is so
that'll give us our new baseline for an
after or an adding board partner card
all right super chats rollerblader 1 499
is our T accent attempts to make a GPU
line akin to LGA 2066 CPUs we use
separate systems for ray tracing in my
field and I can see them selling to
prosumers at that premium yeah I don't
know if that's the intention is to
create like an h EDT equivalent it's
doing that scaling thing again but
certainly for prosumers like developers
I think there's potentially more I guess
value is the right word it's potentially
more motive to buy it than a consumer
right now because if you're developing
and you are making a bet you are taking
a risk and assuming that RT X will
become a thing that can either sell your
games better or an industry-wide thing
you'll look bad if you don't have it
then buying today as a game developer
probably makes sense and is pennies at
the end of the day if you make it you
make it what did what a fortnight been
in for epic like a billion dollars or
something stupid yeah I don't I don't
know what fortnight's making that but
you're making that kind of money it's
pennies especially but it enables better
graphics but also that's epics goal but
yeah I don't know I would agree prosumer
focus makes more sense it's just I don't
think they're trying to do it they're
trying to do gamer focus so it's kind of
mismatched Matt miracle $5 just joined
in how many birkhoff's are we up to now
yes there's actually a joke in the video
that I cut out for time purposes about
having GN ops instead of our TX ops our
new measurement so you might know our TX
ops of course is drive-by in 32 plus FP
32 times 0.8 times something plus
something else times point two for the
DNN plus tensor times point four four
than Alice so that's our tax ops we
think a new metric is in order GN ops
and that is you you take the frequency
of the card and you divide it by X where
X is defined by the marketing department
and they define that based on where they
want the card to fall in the stack so
that is that is how many GN ops we're
running bill one Chavo five dollars it
was a division thank you I'm parenting
quite far behind on super chance haha
dat ik you five dollars are TX on
hunting for a cheap 1080i to upgrade my
ten seventy glad I waited well for the
reviews PS more snowflake we're working
on it she'll be in more shots for sure v
po hey five dollars a good work like
always thank you very much Paul Hawk
this is running a test by the way that's
why I'm doing super chaps right now
25 PLN I'm waiting on 21st gen can't
help but feel like 20 oh I see
21 series can't help but feel like the
20 series is sort of like a beta for the
21 series and yeah I well it's it's new
it's a new technology it's probably it's
probably testing the waters a bit soo
pries cough Aggie or something I don't
know sorry I butchered your last name $5
so we'll the reference 20 atti power
limits lock the card down underwater
more so than the AI V launch cards
probably because we are not hitting
throw limits thermals are a concern so
the GPU temperature is high enough that
we don't have like a flat frequency line
you kind of want like that boost 2.0
style flat frequency line which would
help us sustain higher scores and things
like times by be a bit worse for power
consumption but who cares I guess the
problem is after you solve that and you
flatten the frequency by fixing the
cooling to stay stable like with water
which can tank more thermal change now
you're facing power limits so our limit
is our perf cap is power so yes
absolutely our limit is going to be
power and I don't know how much that's
going to matter when we put water on
these things David now
find out though keep an eye on the
channel subscribe all that we'll find
out $5 Thank You Raj
when does Nvidia qualify as a monopoly
that's clearly part of the problem with
these prices I don't know you're asking
the wrong person to ask an economist or
something you have no idea how any of
that really works or a legal expert
perhaps shark comes and friends $5 hey
Steve thanks for being awesome
does that EVGA card glow completely when
plugged in it appears to be glowing at
the top of the card right now I think I
think that's it this scaling is weird
but it's not gonna affect the score it's
fine yes it appears to only be glowing
at the top the fans aren't spinning
though so it is not really having a
problem with this test it's sinking a
lot of heat yeah no it's it's doing
quite fine I guess the fans off but the
test isn't lon
oh it's on CPU right now too isn't it
yeah it's on the CPU test that's why the
fans aren't spinning it's not doing
anything
sorry it's a UH sink to the heat sunk
the heat sink the heat and now it is
just chilling until the CPU test is done
so I ran a full test for this one to get
a baseline then we're gonna cut the CPU
test next okay so score we care about
graphics 64 36 but total is 59 63 our
CPU is only at 5 gigahertz not the
highest but it's really just for GPU
testing so so let's compare baselines
here the previous baseline for the efi
card was 62 46 this is not hard test
data we'll look into this for the full
review of the EVGA card please don't
take it as hard to test data but we can
get some ad hoc test data so 64 36 puts
us as the stock versus 62 46 for the FPS
let's just do a quick - 62 46 that is
not the correct number 62 46 okay / - 46
it's an improvement of about 3% so it's
about 3% better in this configuration
with the EVGA card and that's that's
primarily gonna be the factory overclock
I'm guessing it's about three percent
better out of the box but that is not
good enough to hit our 7400 point target
for today because we're a thousand
points away presently so let's blast the
power to 130 percent and let's blast the
fans hopefully they're not too loud to
100% and let's run another baseline and
see what does that do compared to the FE
card under the same conditions without
any offset supplied how do things change
let's turn off the CPU tasks run it in
windowed mode go ahead and get gpu-z
open I guess because why not
okay gpu-z excellent utility for this
tech power up makes this one okay so
that's gonna give us our baseline for a
power off set with a fan or a fan max
speed 100% speed with power at 130
percent and this is a reference PCB so
because it's a reference PCB it is a
linear increase so it's 123 percent
versus the same baseline on the
reference card versus 130 percent versus
the same baseline on this card so you
have seven percent more power overhead
to play around with and frequency is
pretty high right now
sustained 1935 to 1965 is what I'm
seeing just as an ad-hoc site just
spotting it no logging or anything right
now 53 degrees
which doesn't mean anything this is a
short test this is not a controlled
thermal test but it does mean that we
are within the higher range of what
boost 4.0 permits
and yeah we'll let that run CEO disaster
score previous equivalent test on the FE
card was sixty five eighteen here so
we'll see what that see how we do here
earlier I missed it earlier someone said
that you should be counting the number
of screws in this card and Jigga screws
or Giga screws depending on which
language you're using or which meme
you're using yeah 10 Giga Ray's I don't
know how I feel about all that I guess
that was part of the formula what -
isn't it that's part of the RT X ops
formula how many Giga rays does do
someone says just tuning in saw a review
of the 28 ETA ZOTAC amp extreme or amp
showed overclock potential about 15%
over what worth the upgrade from to
1080i in SLI
I don't know like it's in games whereas
law is not supported it's definitely
better but so first of all ZOTAC they're
1080i cards the VRM did not make contact
to the cooler so that was poor design we
talked about that then though I don't
know if they fixed that their 980 you
had similar problems on ATI but not
speaking our partner cards yeah is it
worth upgrading it's really more of a
question of do you have like 1200 bucks
where you're just like I don't want this
money anymore it's I have OCD and having
this $1200 just throwing off having a
perfectly round number in my bank
account and I need to get rid of it
that's kind of the question and you know
if you have like a legitimately use if
you're like I don't care what steve says
i know what i need to use this card for
and i can't get it from anything else
that's awesome go buy it because if
there are places you can use those cards
but generally no i don't think so and
envy link is is going to be a bit
different we'll test that soon okay 65
80 i got to get some super chats into so
for this equivalent test on the efi card
we were at 65 18 now we're at 65 80 here
so we haven't really gained much from
just having the addition
power but we have an overclocked Yeti it
and also all silicon is different the GB
is created different so we can't do a
straight comparison 65 80 plus 1 30% and
I expands team notes okay so we need to
start overclocking this thing properly
and okay let's do let's just do a simple
same thing
let's do 80 we did 80 last time we'll
just do the same steps I'm just gonna
set the voltage plus 100 so we can be
placebo it into thinking it does
something and let's run that now to
Nvidia's credit Tom says I asked them
you know I said prove me tell me that
I'm wrong is it a placebo slider and he
said it is not and he explained why he
disagrees with my belief on that in our
interview with him with Tom Peterson if
you wanna track the interview it's got
an explanation of what the voltage
sliders supposed to do as a user as an
enthusiast it doesn't really feel like
it does anything so I don't know it's
they tell me it's not a placebo but I
certainly feel like it does nothing all
right Jason Christophe 499 GM pocket
knife with actual PC building tools yes
you need to have pocket knife to build a
computer and hopefully it has a
screwdriver hamburger buns $5 how did
you all get affected by Florence
football as well we got a lot of rain
we're fine thank you though appreciate
it
I put one of the plants outside so I
could get some rain water so that should
tell you how severe that's okay
more than five dollars how can rate
racing succeed with it having such a low
user base due to price that's a great
question
it's going to require it's a top-down
movement so if Nvidia can play their
cards right I guess you're hoping
developers get the cards you're hoping
that next generation like the 2060
equivalents will get rate racing
features tensor cores whatever whatever
they do at that point
but yeah it's the same problem AMD has
if you have and it will be this these
cards are TX cards
today are going to have lower market
share of course then all of a em these
cards AMD has trouble getting developers
to optimize for their hardware they have
to do a lot of the work for the
developers so what's gonna happen here
it's even less market share how do you
convince a developer to build for it
well probably some kind of MDF maybe an
agreement where you provide Hardware
maybe provide some engineers to help
develop the games and NVIDIA has the
manpower to do that they've done it they
have software developers who can go out
to the game companies and help build the
games you see it with other technologies
Nvidia's pushed in the past so it will
be a top-down effort in order to get any
kind of architects adoption I'm not
saying it's good or bad I'm saying that
from a video standpoint that's what
they're gonna have to do is get
engineers at development houses get
agreements in place and start building
games with it and fast because the
technology is out for consumers now and
there's no games with it so yeah it'll
be tough that's running a benchmark with
the XC Ultra EVGA card we already did
the EFI card talk about that more in a
moment
Gianni 641 two dollars thank you very
much when is the EVGA ex one out force
plebs is it not out yet I don't know
Jacob if your watch and text me and tell
me if there's a planned launch or if
it's already out for precision x1 for
the the I guess everyday the the non
media users is what I'm looking for the
normals that's that's what it is alright
okay
so I'll keep an eye out for that if you
updates me ninjetta Steve $15 I'm bald
can I have some of your hair that's a
rather shape for they just couldn't like
lose some like patches on a couple
places I think you could probably get
like you know like like some kind of wig
or something that doesn't involve my
hair $10 from Matthews manifestation
live no count with that one Thank You
Matthew for the 10 bucks
67 13s are scored times by extreme
graphic score 67 13 score target 7400
scored to beat 71 27 1-3 that's with a
130 off percent power target max fans
and what else did we there 80 megahertz
80 megahertz on the core plus 80
megahertz okay so we have quite a ways
to go to get back to the queue grab me
some water please
my voice is going thank you so we were
ways to go to get back to the 7120 that
we had on the F E card and right now
we're at 67 13 times by extreme let's go
ahead just bump that to plus 100 and
Andrew behind the camera we'll be back
in a moment
hey these needed water can't speak
anymore
benchmarks times pi extreme all I've
done is plus another 20 megahertz didn't
do anything with Fe I'm just curious to
see will it do something with this
because it didn't really do much
previously so if we get to like 67 15
then that'll answer the question thank
you
okay
what's chats an new sponsor Fiji water
I mean hey if you work for them I'd take
a water sponsor I guess over like a
hardware sponsor just because it's
completely unrelated well no that's not
true
we'll be shills for water cooling
forever Fiji forever the course of
Fiji's company history will change by
sponsoring us which they're not
presently it just to be really clear by
sponsoring us will will slowly convince
them to get into liquid cooling and
they'll become the new worldwide
supplier all the all the water use in
your open loops for the fusion will come
from literal mountains because it's more
pure hey what size shirts out the
quickest I think a large and Excel for
us all right what are the other cons
official water cameras Nexus okay so
super chance Michael Romero any plans $5
thank you watch any plans for a darker
colored mousepad I love my triblend
shirt and its color scheme goes great
with my PC so that is that's awesome
thank you for supporting and grabbing
one tribe lines are actually I think our
most popular material so we have other
ideas for mousepads we don't have an
immediate plan for produce for
manufacturing them but we have ideas and
they do involve darker mouse pads yes
not sure on the sizes yet though
Alex $10 so Steve 528 ETI or wait 430
atti
I hear the new gen actually has tiny
people inside of it for hyperrealism
okay I thought this was a real question
for a second and then then you reminded
me that we were on the internet and
getting comments from the internet if it
were a real question let's just say it
is first of all will be the 30 series or
only will be 2100 series that is what I
want to know chat using your
clairvoyance that you often have when
commenting on our videos what will the
future Nvidia video cards be called
let's take bets now will reave all take
an ad hoc tally of
what's the most popular and then in a
year or two when they come out I can I
can declare who was right so I've got
the first vote 2100 and I have some
answer from EVGA on other questions to
you someone says 69s he's next three
thousand twenty one hundred it'll be 30
atti LTX 420 okay that's not that's not
gonna be a thin 1180 that'd be a good
one go back to GTX 11 series 21:xx 3000
sears again I'm getting half and half
right now come on chat don't let me down
I need a firm decision here 21 atti and
x-series you heard it here first folks
Steve said to wait for the r-tx
GT 38 ETA it'll leave 4000 series to
convey the confusion for everybody so
alright we're seeing more 3,000 right
now than 2,000 okay I'm gonna call it
there so in a year or two when the new
cards come out I want everyone to
remember that you all as a group decided
it would be called the 3000 series so
when all the rumor mill articles start
going up that says 30 atti rumors and
it's not called that when it launches I
want you to remember who was responsible
for the for catalyzing that name 6775
for the score was that actually an
improvement I don't know it was but very
little so 67 75 our previous score 67 13
score to beat 7120 target score 7 400 so
that was plus 130 percent max fans and
plus 100 megahertz so we did go up more
than our previous 100 megahertz offset
on the founders edition card but we need
to get along more than that because the
founders edition cards stopped at 70 120
let's let's quit playing around here
let's just go for 150 offset and then
200 and see what happens then we'll
start doing the memory 150 for the
offset now are just jumping by 50
megahertz see if it holds see if I want
a GNX 2080s will we'll get into
manufacturing video cards posthaste
so a high priority of mine speaking of
manufacturing things taking lessons from
Linus on those integrations the GaN
cobalt blue beer glasses with the gold
rim are back in stock finally and
hopefully they stay there for at least a
little while I guess but those are on
store I Kara's exit on that if you want
to grab one we have them in groups of
one two or four discounted as you
increase quantity
why do gamer focus target products look
so tacky
well you know just say that but I've
spoken to some companies about this so
it's not true anymore but for a period
if you don't want to argue it was like
the only thing anyone spoke about at CES
and we actually stopped covering some
booths because all they had was RGB and
it was enough if you remember that
during that period I had companies
telling me that they would see Plus like
40% one side plus 60% engagement on
Twitter which is of course all the only
metric that ever matters when they had
something with RGB versus not so when
will they stop literal gamer product
stop looking tacky and I guess this this
I would not say this looks tacky it's
like Nvidia is trying to do an Apple
thing I guess I would say it looks good
it's certainly not very functional but
it's fine
but I know what you mean by tacky and I
think the answer is as long as people
buy them in greater quantities than
other sleek designs there I'll keep
looking that way fractal is pushed
pretty hard on the sort of businesslike
look and they seem to do okay
but there's still a smaller case company
by all measures so tells you the
audience size because there's this big
fancy cases I have a lot of plastic
they're super popular for a while
all right Alex $10 got that one petrol
head two two two six one dollar thank
you very much
silk monkey two dollars best GPU ever
and why is it the Buddha three PCI it is
the beauty three PCI because you gave me
two dollars and it seems like you really
want me to say that it is so so that's
what it is
next one super villain three two one two
dollars I hear you might be might need a
table for your next build yes
typically I just have Andrew or Patrick
or someone just hold the components like
the case and then we build the system
while someone's holding it actually we
put it on someone's back and build the
computer there but ever since that Verge
video came out man has changed
everything I didn't know that didn't
know you could have a table but has a
weird comment that they made I don't
know why they did that tools you need
for that like okay it's enough it's
enough with like the bashing The Verge
video but also tools you need for the
job oxygen in order to stay alive a
table you should probably have have
functional arms and hands like where do
we stop with the needs why is it the
table five dollars mod 989 do you
believe the power limit may be specific
to the kuda part or the FP use of the
GPU so when RT x or tensor is active
they increase the overall power limit
that's an interesting question I wish I
had a good way to look into that right
now do I think that the power limits
specific to the kuda side of the GPU no
I think the power limit is specific to
the GPU like the whole thing and how
much power is drawing they have hardware
monitor sensors on it now they have like
what I figure they call it I something
for current they have current monitoring
now that's a bit more advanced in the
previous generator always had it but
more advanced than previously I think
it's just for whatever the GP is drawing
but I don't know I look into it 68 68
that's a familiar score wouldn't we hit
that we hit that exact score previously
with the exact offset
that's not a good sign
with the fe card or the 150 offset 123
power not 130 we hit the exact same
score now there are some variants here
3dmark times pi are not perfect they
have a lot of error we ran it again we
get a slightly different score but let's
keep going see if we can get it to crash
let's try just 200 okay yes I need to
start the benchmark all right so we're
going for 74 hundred points and our own
score to beat is 71 20
we're at 68 68 currently on the EVGA
card we capped at 71 20 on the fe card
from nvidia dustin f $10 thank you much
100 Hertz plus 1440p ultra wide monitors
are the arguments for the 28 ET i going
from 70 FPS to 100 FPS is a nice
improvement better usage case than
pushing for 60 FPS 4k in my opinion yeah
they're they're marketing in general is
kind of weird that chart the 4k 60 chart
where they're just like it's like 20 80
TI 2080 1080 TI 1080 and there's a line
that says 4k 60 so and and we know that
the 2018 the 1080 are the same we know
that 20 80 TI is like between fifteen
and thirty two percent better than at
1080i depending on the game so what is
the scale on that chart it's gotta be
like thirty to seventy or something
that's crashing that's not good so yeah
I would agree there for K 60 push was an
odd one especially because 1080i really
did that the ultra wide use case is an
interesting thing I have not benchmarked
ultra wide in a while now we can look
into that again
chase 499 why'd I include the 28 why not
include the tight Titan B and the
benchmark seems like an interesting
comparison it is we're doing a separate
video on it and I didn't include it
because Nvidia got us the cars and the
drivers on Friday and I had a lot of
work to do just on those devices not
including rebuilding the Titan B with
the air cooler because it's under water
right now and then re running all those
tests so it'll be a separate piece I've
had it in mind but it's got to wait a
little bit
so we crashed here this we just stepped
down the core offset the keep in mind
the core is boosting a bit higher than
the FE card so we've got that going for
us the offset means more it's pushing it
higher than the FE card offset was if
it's boosting higher in general
especially because the thermal advantage
so we need to start pushing memory and
hopefully this over clocks like crazy on
the memory because that's what we're
gonna need in order to actually get some
progress towards our score
all right hmm $2.00 tom's hardware just
called 2088 TI the titan v killer yes
that is that's what everyone cared about
everyone wanted a killer of a $3,000
card targeted for compute users its
youtube visitor $10
well the RT acts 20 ATT i also make a
good hair cooler maybe a hair dryer
think it it's a little on the warmer
side wishbone five dollars
you know Andy Navi is gonna be a bit
more powerful than the 2084 way less the
price I have a feeling a huge undercut
jab to the face of Nvidia's I don't know
that I don't think anyone knows that so
yeah I'd be careful with like the
careful with the the promises on Andy
like don't put any more pressure on them
they have enough let them do their thing
don't don't decide their performance
before it's actually even like a card
alright let's launch this again
hopefully this thing over clocks a lot
for the memory oh and I had an answer
from EVGA earlier on something - I see
what that was someone had a question or
I had a question so they said oh we have
precision someone asked us women's
precision x1 gonna be available tomorrow
is the answer for the beta for the
public and someone says someone
apparently someone in chat so they had a
pre-order issue I don't know if I
haven't gotten to that question yet but
my EVGA contacts I guess all your
questions had for Adam with the
pre-order issue say he can contact me
and I will help him out if he is still
interested jacob f as spelled as it
sounds jacob f @ eb g a comm he's on
Twitter - Jacob Freeman I guess he'll
help you out I didn't see your issue but
I'm glad he did
ok customer service I guess fans Mac
those smacks those out again Power Max I
don't know man o'clock I guess let's it
crashed at 200 let's do 175 see if that
crashes and then start pushing memory
and will engage the placebo slider
benchmarks times by extreme disable CPU
around windowed click outside click back
ok what's chat saying spam is email no
don't do that it's trying to help out
the guy isn't literally EVGA it's just
trying to help out ok so what are your
thoughts on pairing 28 ETI with the 7500
k it depends on what you're doing I
guess if you're gaming then trolly a bit
overkill on the GPU side you're gonna
well I mean not for 4k it really came in
at 4k I guess that's fine Steve how long
or oh man lots of questions in normal
chat now consensus overall seems to be
that most triple-a titles will run a
pretty solid 60 FPS so no these running
4k settings max this is true I guess
yeah I mean look at our benchmarks but
also a 1080i you can do that too like
it's yeah it's better but do you need an
anti-aliasing like blasted do you need
post-processing
all the way up do you need grass effects
all the way up like how much of these
effects do you even notice when you're
playing the game if you start tuning
some of them down I would wager you
won't even notice a lot of the
differences some of them are way more
heavy hitting than others like texture
quality but and mesh quality LOD scale
and stuff like that that matters but
even a low descaling though now stuff
gets farther away really don't need to
see it that badly in high detail so I
would yes the 20 atti objectively is
superior to all the other cards on our
chart other maybe I haven't retest them
some of them on the Titan B but
apparently it's better than that too so
yeah I guess
I guess it's better at 4k 60 but you can
achieve that with existing hardware I
don't know if the price weren't 70%
higher I would have a way easier time
saying that it's worth picking up today
like if it were eight hundred bucks
maybe even nine hundred even though
that's still price creep maybe nine
hundred but a thousand to twelve hundred
it's it's too much it's there's half of
half of the cards aim isn't even usable
right now
RTX does nothing they're a press tech
demos but we set all that in review okay
any questions and there's stuff in super
chat - I'm gonna try and catch up I have
to scroll up a bit there's so much I
think I'm like an hour behind on super
chats but there's a lot of them I
appreciate it thank you very much just
give me some time okay we got the video
three question and got the ultra-wide
got the Tom's Hardware thin hair coolers
they hand alright where is the most
recent question I'm being told
apparently Andy announced Navi for 2018
or something I guess that's cool I yeah
I've been buried and office moving and
testing so I didn't see it I know they
were planning now be in 2018 like years
ago
I just wasn't I'm not sure the current
like what's supposed to come out for
Navi first okay $5 Gandalf says seems
the consensus for RTX gaming has been
reached any plans to test rendering
suites that use ray Tracey and like Maya
v-ray IRA etc I figured with a name like
and off you'd make you shall not pass
count regarding the price but I guess
this works too yeah we do out we we have
loose plans but we're not testing that
stuff yet cuz like blender needs to be
updated still to support it that's on
Blender side 69-62 is the score that's a
plus 175 so we're stable we're stable at
plus 175 and no memory offset yet plus
175 is stable 6960 we need to get back
up to at least 70 120 to be where we
were on the efi card let's just push
this to 800 and see if that's stable
I might need just more cooling for this
I don't know might be a PCB with more
with a higher power limit to near that
ACS card once I reassemble it okay so
that's gonna run we're gonna see what we
can do
goal is 7400 points score to beat is our
own because I'm only looking at our own
7120 I'm sure someone's got a kingpin
kenan has a higher score so he won 20 on
this thing that was plus 200 plus 850
offset the offsets are not necessarily
linearly comparable because that card it
has a higher baseline clock so keep that
in mind but yeah certainly 120 is what
we need to be at think it back to where
we were 279 from rock your socks off 420
when will you be able to test enemy link
soon the mage 500 yen is that when will
you be making a bigger mod patch what
that's Excel to the Android crowd and XS
to you iPhone folks
okay now I get it did they really call
it a bigger phone XS seriously why
that's so stupid
I don't pay his engine Apple sorry I
missed it Sean O'Shay $5
just take the raglan hoodie design and
make it into a long sleeve we can do
that I guess
smarter mm OH $2 RTX SLI have you tried
it even for fun
soon Paul Lewis 20 bucks no comment
thank you very much Paul bill on chavo
$5 damn that card is thick exclamation
question mark one exclamation
exclamation it's pretty phat 2.75 slot
maruko-chan $5 well the 2080 TI is
useful for me as deep learning
programmer there we go there we go we
got some real use cases will it be
useful for me as a dl programmer will I
have to get a Titan V what's different
in the thick shake art think EVGA card
is phat earthy really cooll Ian's better
it's the reference PCB though the vrm is
the same if you watch our vrm analysis
of this one then you know the vrm on
that one that's pretty good but the
cooler is different we need to test to
see how much different it is what's the
advantage so we don't know yet how much
better it is thermally but we shall see
how it does not work like I guess it has
a plus 7% higher power target but you
kind of run into questions of who has
the better like where you buy 10 cards
they're gonna have a different frequency
well frequency behavior so there's some
silicon lottery there too I play alright
so this is running plus 175 and an 800
memory offset and if you missed it the
GN beer glasses are back in stock which
I'm just gonna mention every time I pick
it up because my voice is dead 59
degrees presently which is good so in
our testing if you missed the review we
found I think there was a point at 62 or
63 degrees where we had some clock drops
we're at 59 here so the clock is going
to boost a bit higher than if it were at
63 where boost 4.0 kicks in and starts
dragging the clock down with
with the temperature in it it seems very
aggressive - do you really need to drag
it down that much before like getting
closer to your max I don't know 7116 so
we're almost there 70 120 is what we
want to get to it to get to beat our
previous card 7 116 now it's plus 125
plus 800 getting suspicious of if we're
gonna do 7400 today but let's let's go
ahead and boost this memory I'm gonna
try 900 see if a 900 offset on the
memory survives times bypass okay
so previously we got we have a lot more
people in chat now than previously so
the beginning of the street I was
talking about the shirt you probably
heard about it before the the limited
edition foil shirt we when we did the
last big stream at the the house before
moving this was up for pre-order because
we wanted to see how many we'd go
through to figure out like how much
extra do we need to reserve for things
like potential loss during shipping for
example we've had some stuff just
through USPS where we get lost on the
way to Australia when people buy stuff
and we always replace up stuff so if you
had that problem let us know we'll
replace it for sure but fortunately we
didn't have any of those problems I
don't think maybe one we didn't really
have any of those problems so we have
some extra inventory now we're releasing
it because everyone got their shirts at
this point or if you didn't and it was
lost
email us immediately so we can replace
it for you but we have tracking on all
of that so you should be able to see if
it was delivered and we can check for
you if you're not sure anyway we
released the rest of the inventory
there's not much of it after this after
it sells through that's it we're not
doing another production run so this is
just the leftovers at this point that we
had for quality assurance and for
shipping overhead but that's on store
documents access not now if you wanna
grab it just just pointed that out for
the newcomers the stream so this is
chugging along it hasn't crashed 900
offset in the memory so we're at 7,900
megahertz x - roughly for our comeback
clock is at 175 offset let's keep an eye
on this this time and see like
kind of what it there you go 420 that
chats gonna love that why is the
computer feeding into chats demands
uh-huh
2025 1935 so it's gonna fluctuate a bit
I think we're gonna say crash 200 I
think we're gonna try and push like 180
185 it's not like that and see what we
can do later and if I stop screwing
around with that our scores will be a
bit higher too but it's not that
important okay check in all of the chats
what is what is the chat saying what do
you got for me chat has NVIDIA beat AMD
in terms of raw or compute now they
actually have decent async I haven't
done just like it's like compute
workloads it done gaming workloads so I
don't have a direct answer for you I
haven't done you know I compute work
like Dustin what is this a thousand
stone from from oh in DIA here in India
due to 30% import tariffs and profit
margins the ten ATT I still costs over a
$1000 USD
this may be a very rare case where the
new 20 atti is actually a decent value
because for some reason and Vidya isn't
charging me the import tariff yeah I
don't know how the tariffs work there
but the I guess the point that stands is
if you have 20 eighties in your country
and 1080i is in your country and the
1080i is more expensive than just the 28
is the same in terms of performance I'll
probably get a bit better with drivers
don't bet on two more don't bet the
house on it but get a bit better and its
newer so it'll have longer support going
forward so yeah if the 2080 new is
cheaper than the 1080i new in your
country I guess just by the 2080 instead
between those two cards specifically the
2080 is cheaper than a 1080i than men I
don't know that like I don't know that
that kinda seems like an easy choice to
me if you have that money to spend and
you were definitely going to buy a 1080i
then yeah 2080 I for the same price is
a crazy good deal if that's the case in
your country I don't keep tabs on
pricing it globally but you know all of
my comments I got to keep in mind that
I'm working off the u.s. prices but if
it's the same price for cheaper is
that's uh I guess go for that I don't
know if it's a good thing or not
if it's more expensive on average and
probably not but okay so 70 135 we've
beaten our score probably uh from the
Effie cards that's good we're getting
somewhere
so EJ's actually ultra has officially
overcome the founders edition and that
was at plus 175 and plus 900 I don't
know how much higher this memory can go
before it starts freaking out and
crashing or throwing artifacts let's do
950 I'm getting kind of hesitant towards
there then we'll try and push the core
of hit more
so we've beaten our Fe score that's good
that's that's half the goal today I'd
like to see seventy three hundred I said
7400 target but I'd really like to see
73 board is a lit someone says bleh oh
yes right because we were at four 20
megahertz during the loading screen
earlier board is lit blaze it 420 blaze
in okay a I confirmed GTX 420 smoke
tracing all right very good Chad thank
you never let me down
never never fail me don't change except
for well sometimes sometimes maybe it's
worth it okay Hudson ye $5 is there a
way to benchmark tensor cores it's a
bigger reason for me to buy it and it's
a bargain for deep learning absolutely
I'm not qualified to do it but yes maybe
an intense
or if they don't they probably will do
them at some point they're definitely
deep learning benchmarks like I've seen
the software and videos done
demonstrations using it it's just we
don't cover that stuff so I'm not gonna
pretend I even know I have no idea like
I know that the software exists I just
don't know anything about it so I'm
sorry but
it exists so I hope that's not for you
to go look for benchmarks because it is
out there I've seen it used and in tech
like marketing demonstrations max
Cowgill $5 Steve can you get David
Cantor on to do a deep dive on Torian
yes actually we are planning to try and
get him out to the office at some point
and we have some content ideas one of
them would be like walking through the
block diagram for Torian for example and
explaining how do you read this what is
it what are these things mean why are
there even G pcs why are there T pcs and
we talked about that in our architecture
deep dive but David Kant is a definitely
an expert in the space and give you
really good answers on that so we are
planning for something like that $5
message retracted thank you very much
anyway the court meant $5 to use HDMI or
DisplayPort which would you recommend I
use whichever cable is closest to me
I think DisplayPort is is typically what
I work with but it depends on your
monitor like if if there's actually a
point where you're hitting throughput
limitations then check the specs on the
cables make sure you have something that
fits I don't keep up to date on those
though
Marco Mascaro $5 I don't mind the EVGA
design what I'm wondering is are twenty
two pins actually necessary on the asus
strix 20 atti 22 pins
what is that in reference to oh the fan
is that the reference to the fan I think
they told me why that's there we might
have it in the teardown video if we
don't then I can get it for the review
but one thing I did like about it and
this isn't public yet but when we open
the card for the ACS one it opens like a
book so it just goes like that and the
cable can stay completely connected
because they use the sufficiently long
one that's on the end of the board so I
really like that it's a really small
feature I don't know if that's what
you're referring to specifically that's
what jumps out to me 71-65 it survived
all right we've got a chance got a
chance of at least seeing 7300 today
we're past the founders edition card so
that's about to start we might do it not
I don't think we're gonna do 7405 we
might 273 say 165 those that plus 135
plus 950
how much more does the memory have in
the tank we're at a 950 offset on this
thing let's not push it too much to 975
it's at 130 power target so EVGA 'he's
got enough some advantage there but we
might need a like one of their FTW 3s or
some other full cost and board to get
some more power into it or mods don't
let me down EVGA I need more points it's
the only thing that matters on the
internet who has more of them
let's see EVGA he's a I had Jacob says
here comes the world records score nope
but thanks for trying to flatter me I'm
not gonna fall for your tricks
Dennis $5 any chance you'll do a deep
dive on DL SS when it becomes relevant
yes absolutely
I'm really interested in DL SS and
what's the Odin called MLA a thank you
DL SS MLA a very interested in those I
think it's actually it's one of the
smartest overall ideas and video had for
this launch liked the idea of using deep
learning to figure out how it's super
sample and and how to do better
anti-aliasing so you're synthesizing
pixels you like sampling the screen and
you don't need every single pixel there
you just kind of get most of them and
then synthesize the ones in between
based on the pixels around it that makes
a lot of sense to me and based on the
frames previous and after so it's
temporal so I think the technology is
very interesting and we'll definitely
look at it I hope it gets some adoption
on a wider scale because it is probably
one of the more interesting things on
videos doing this launch and it's just
it's getting overshadowed because
there's nothing really with it yet but
absolutely very interested in it $2
jennifer roger one of our patreon
backers $2 hi Andrew don't we don't yet
have any don't yet have any of the
Andrew memes from last time the what was
it andrew is the best 3d 3d artist and
camera man of all time or whatever that
was a good one
Anthony labcoat $20 love your channel
wondering if you could do a comparison
between SLI scaling using envy link
versus conventional HP bridges I'm still
waiting for my pair of 2080 T eyes in
the mail want to know how well to work
yes sort of
we can't put come back screen died I
don't come back we can't put a
celebrity's on Envy link obviously but I
am doing ad me link testing I guess I'll
do some SLI testing too while I'm at it
but I don't have the same cards you have
you're talking about 220 ATT eyes Fe
cards and I'm gonna be mixing and
matching cards so I don't know if
that'll even work we'll find out soon it
may be tonight or tomorrow horizon
Walker $5.00 thank you very much no
message coup de coeur $5 what are your
thoughts on pairing 28 et eyes of the
7700 K think I got that one I don't know
if if it was like later but if if you're
running out like really high resolutions
and it's not a cpu-bound game I guess
that's okay I you're gonna run into
bottlenecks at like at low resolutions
that I CV bottlenecks 7156 is that lower
that is lowered we're at 70 165 before
so that frequency didn't help us we're
starting to get into diminishing returns
and margin of test variants do 185 on
the course you know that does it's gonna
crash at 200 so any more cooling on this
I think you'll hook up a fan blast it
blasted in the face and I see I can grab
a fan anyone ii think we have
what can I use for this I guess Noctua
why not look better we have like higher
rpm fans but this one won't blow out the
audio too much just too big for those
holes and get one in there okay so we're
gonna we're gonna add a fan of this just
in case you could do a soon on fan or a
maglev fan need a screw power supplies
crews okay we're just adding a fans of
the test bench right now if you're
wondering where I went a screw
so I might want to put a faster fan on
there but this should be okay want to go
in there's a fan header down here
where's my fan Hatter
and that's kind of far away
Jenny an extension cable - all right
Syrena had a fan just to crank try and
get some extra cooling on this thing I
think it needs it at this point that's
not the right screw for that you get an
extension cable on the correct screw and
then we will see if adding a fan can
help us out at all with this so many
chrome axe cables let me just just like
what am I supposed to do with this this
is what Noctua sent us once at which we
very much appreciate but man this is a
lot of a lot of fan extensions okay so
need a screw and then we can install
that fancy that helps out our score
looks like the test is surviving by the
way I think I put it up to 185 offset so
I'll actually got a bit more score
hopefully
and now the Fen this is the advantage of
the new offices it's much easier to do
things like changing Hardware on the fly
during a stream
okay
remember to always wear an anti-static
bracelet when you're doing this this is
doesn't need to connect to ground it
just uses Chi energy a fan cable I don't
know what speed these headers are at
right now hopefully it's 100 though okay
a little bit of extra air not much but
it's something any any any degree will
help right now
71 83 so that was stable we're getting
there
I want 7300 I want to modify my u-haul
to be more realistic to modify it from
70 70 470 370 183 that's at plus 185
Plus 950 added a fan take a note of that
I need to get through more Super chats
in a moment he's not fighting static
he's fighting cancer yes sir ever until
the LIVESTRONG bracelet RTX bracelet oh
there are a there are a lot of The Verge
comments right now okay 71 83 let's see
if I don't know let's try let's try 190
I guess we're gonna crash sin might as
well try 195 when it crashes there I
want everyone to send an F and chat for
respect because it will 195 offset 935
on the marryin not 959 75 is that even G
a cooler being very loud I'm not in a
position to objectively measure it right
now I yeah I need some I'll measure it
for the review I'm not gonna spit a
number out there cuz I actually don't
know yet you're not supposed to push it
off before it dies stress to wait got to
wait for it to die for it to pay
respects to it jumping the gun
now okay apparently f is for The Verge I
miss I didn't know that chat started
this there's more apps now
all right okay it's running for now
super Jets mm-hmm Chris Smith $5 cancel
my 2080 pre-order glad I did have a beer
on me Steve thank you very much
hey I mean if if if we save you some
money
then that's good I like if you already
had hardware you're happy with of course
we also want to show when people should
upgrade if it would help them but it's
not always the case so I'm glad it
helped you Alex Garcia $4.99 expected VR
games for 2080 I've been told by the
Internet's that it is significant and we
do have the capability to do objective
VR testing it's done it in the past most
recently with the 1700 r7 versus 7700
k-man it's it's a pain to test though
like setup that software is non-trivial
but if there's interest I can look into
it
the problem is I don't have the newest
to VR headsets we have the original vibe
and whatever the Bach ulis rift was the
came with the touch controllers so is
that stuff even relevant anymore like
that I know there's a new vibe if I have
to buy that I'm gonna lose money on the
content so I don't know horizon Walker
$5 has the software supportive Envy link
been added I don't know I have heard
from another reviewer that they're
having a lot of trouble with envy link
but I haven't validated it myself yet
still alive you all prematurely pushed F
just like I told you Jai axle gaming $5
purchase GN beer glass and core temps
have significantly improved thanks Steve
I also copied your frame the wafer idea
nice so oh yeah and lighting it up
that'd be kind of cool too so frame the
wafer idea if you missed it this was on
our just kind of a test livestream test
dream please ignore for our fan mail
segment and we actually bought this one
but so Patrick cut this out framed a
fortunately arrived like cracked and
shattered they're getting good
reflections on that
this is a this actually has r-tx on
right now so yeah it arrived like this
the only thing with r-tx on and it still
looks fine they're like this one's good
these are cut out so you can buy these
on eBay for like 20 or 25 dollars or
something the wafers and just buy like a
shadow box we're gonna put on the wall
at some point but this just back here
for now but it is a cool piece of I
guess tech art ish for what we do okay
72 33 men we're climbing fast now I
really thought it was over 72 that's uh
it's there's a chance thought it was all
over
so our new goal I changed it to seventy
three hundred our original go is sunny
four hundred our Titan V score of 78
hundred seventy eight thirty six they're
not hitting that but that was heavily
modified and also Titan B so it did a
lot of work for me so let's see if we
can let's see if we can get past this I
don't want to see any EPS out of you
until it actually crashes this time by
the way it's uh it's from that so it's
just two hundred I only did five
megahertz because previously added two
hundred offs that had crashed so I want
to see that happens again or if that was
a fluke then maybe adding the the fan
might have helped there a lot of Epson
chat right now I I specified for there
not to be EPS and chat how many hours
have you put into testing in the past
week PS I was the guy who asked about
gtp at the epoxies panel oh cool yeah
that was actually one of the best
questions at that panel probably the
best question of the panel so that is
from Cory $5 thank you very much how
many hours in testing I think I kept
track up until yesterday so how many
days was that Thursday let me go through
it having an office that means that I'm
keeping track of the hours which is
probably bad Thursday that was
Furstenberg embargo was the 14th so
Thursday 22 hours Friday
14 hours Saturday 14 hours Sunday 14
hours actually kind of late Monday I
think that was 16 and then Tuesday was
when did I start on Tuesday remember I
don't apply 18 hours or something on
Tuesday maybe 20 so whatever that is but
all the other hours were sleep says okay
don't worry okay so this is running it's
not crashed damn it okay good didn't
crash you're all you're all pushing for
that F F is making it pass okay wow you
must sleep in the office I have done
that Steve Reder wall art plan can I
send you some s GI stuff that'd be cool
what kind of yeah I mean s GI is is an
interesting company for sure they
spawned Jensen and NVIDIA so if you have
SGI stuff that you don't want you have
no sentimental attachment to you are
welcome to send it along the P o box is
open it will remain open for at least
one year and of course I don't plan to
close it so you're welcome to we are
probably going to do like another fan
mail thin stream at some point because
we have enough boxes to open and we sell
all the CDs out happens on the art yet
I'm gonna go through like the next group
of stuff that came in I know there's
some core memory that's really cool and
we appreciate all that thank very much
but the planet I think someone had an
idea of doing a pixel art Jeon logo out
of CPUs which is actually collide yes so
we might do that I don't know maybe just
like over there behind like the frame
shirts or something not really sure like
maybe up there I don't know let me know
what you think chat feel like a pixel
art cpu GM logo or like maybe put it off
over here we had a had our poster
videocard poster here but it was
reflecting all the light so let me know
what you think it was kind of the going
plan though did it die it might have
might have made it
I love fan mail videos yeah I think I'm
thinking like monthly just as a live
stream okay just came in how is it going
okay so let me give you the recap I lost
your name sorry it's called up too fast
so for the person you said just came in
how's it going my original goal today
was 74 hundred points and we started
with the founders edition card we ran a
baseline test I have all the notes here
I'll run you through it quickly baseline
test on this meaning no overclocking at
all we're ignoring the CPU just graphics
score was 62 46 points I wanted to hit
7400 so we had 1200 to go ish 1150 and
then I offset the power 122 percent with
max fans that put this thing to 65
18-game 300 points just from that time
of spy extreme then we offset the core
80 megahertz 6700 points offset 100
baggers 67 12 points not a gain really
offset at 125 got to 6809 skip a few
steps here eventually started doing core
memory overclocking got it 270 120
points on the founders Edition now with
EVGA s card which is the XE ultra it's a
reference PCB it's the same as the other
but it goes up to 130 percent power
inside 123 and it's got better cooling
and I added a knock to a fan in front of
just a blast air in there which seems to
be helping actually and now we are at 72
21 which is actually downgrade from the
previous score of 72 33 so we're kind of
within error now this point is that 200
megahertz or what is that
that's the 200 Hertz offset previously
we crashed that offset with a 925 memory
so we're trying to hit 70 300 I've
modified my goal I'd still like to see
74 but I don't think it's gonna happen
so we were going for 73 today and we're
at like 7 2 2 2 or something like that
let's just see if it will crash that's
what I'm going for now so let's do 210
and see also if the score stops decaying
that would be nice
this will kind of confirm what's going
on there so that's a 10 megahertz offset
additionally everyone is doing the EPS
again when does the stream end it ends
when I hit 70 300 damn points and times
quite extreme ha ha all right what's the
max frequency achieve so far that's kind
of a trick question because the max
frequency is not necessarily the well it
is not the sustained frequency so the
max frequency was 22:05 megahertz which
is very high but it immediately crashed
after that doesn't count
we had like 2130 2115 stuff like that
not sustained that is crashing not
sustained sustained is closer like 2070
in best cases 2080 yeah so that did not
survive with a 210 mega Hertz offset so
your theory about F saving it Ron
it's just gonna reboot I think I can
push the memory some more though
okay let me check all of my other all my
other notes okay
has the got that question already got
that question it burns when I pee
great five dollars from them I pee of
course being as an Internet Protocol
very clever there how long do you give
it until someone changes the bios much
in the same way as Vega 56 or 60 forward
to get a higher power element that's
hard to do with Nvidia in that they
don't allow it so you're better off with
hard mods with that with Nvidia stuff
unfortunately we might try like a shunt
mod I don't know I don't know if it
works anywhere though builds orders kind
of questioning that I think I don't
might be still in chat but he seems kind
of skeptical of whether those would
still work all right so that did not go
over well just go down to 200 see if
that's even stable still you know I'm
gonna do 195 and I'm gonna try and push
the core the memory excuse me to 1000
and just see if we instantly lock and
crash and the fans spin up again that's
good okay times by extreme nope nope
when hits her do graphics only every
time spy extreme okay times by extreme
graphics only and they will windowed
actually to full screen graphics only
please okay see how that does
Jesse foster $5.00 Steve can you turn
the h 500 P into a litter box with an
art heap Cooper what what's that mean
I think the answer is no Brendan $5 just
got a foil shirt awesome Thank You
Brandon like I said we we just put
whatever we have left over from the it's
a couple things so we ordered extra wow
they're almost all gone actually yeah
they're gonna be gone the stream so we
are we had the orders up I don't know
month or two ago two months ago locked
them to make sure we have enough left
over for QA for like people who wanted
to exchange sizes if they bought the
wrong size it didn't have too many of
those and then also in this don't know
if it's interesting or not but we've
learned that when ordering shirts if
they are custom sewn like these are
custom stitched to our own spec it's not
just like a guild in shirt or something
so on a custom stone that means that
you're buying a certain amount of fabric
and you can either buy over or under so
we knew how many shirts we wanted but
then there's some variance you might
might be 10% variance if they say they
have a 10% chance of like screwing some
up and they throw those out so we order
over that way we for sure have enough to
account for like lost mail for size
exchanges because it's a percent based
system so if we're like trying to buy a
certain amount of larges and we know
like okay we want this many larges
because typically people buy a lot of
large a lot of X a lot of 2x but not the
other sizes we have to order over so
it's partly partly that but primarily we
we had extras for size exchanges and not
many people had those sorry those will
be gone soon
enemy link bridge big enough for SLI
with multi slot cards and that was from
a fan to for DRR there's an enemy link
bridge big enough for sli with multi
slot cards yes you can buy different
sized unrevealing fridges you can buy
two slot three slot and I think maybe a
four slot something like that it's just
like Castle high bridges I on
seven seven nine nine $10 and he brought
Steve you saved me from a poor purchase
thanks for upholding integrity versus
pleasing a company for industry favors
and perks like a lot of reviewers out
there I mean I get are you saying that
said a lot of reviews are pretty
critical of this product so that was
good to see most of the reviews actually
we're pretty critical this time so Linus
J and I don't know what what the other
said but Linus and J I watched check
Paul's Twitter doesn't Paul s hardware
except on Twitter he's just Paul
Hardware cuz Paul Paul's Hardware on
Twitter is a literal hardware store Paul
what's he saying
I can't see it 73 63 what card is he
using what
Oh seventy-four twelve take that Paul
hashtag rip Paul apparently Paul tweeted
at us I hope he's watching right now
Paul are you watching tweet at me or
something
hang on guys I need to take him can so
what can everyone just are you zoomed in
on this enough everyone do me a favor
take a screenshot of your screen right
now and take a screenshot of that tweet
it at Paul Hardware not Paul's hardware
that's a hardware store Paul Hardware
and do hash tag rip Paul our IP Paul if
one of the moderators in chat can help
me out
hashtag rip Paul and you can send an
Athlon with that too Paul tweeted at us
and said f hashtag ripped GN at gamers
Nexus and he apparently is overclocking
at the same time which is very fun thank
you Paul for doing that 78363 you should
get on stream man 73 63 points he got
well there you go Paul 74 12 so rip Paul
let's let's keep this battle going
that's awesome man Paul if you're
watching thank you for joining in I
haven't checked chat that was a busy
telling everyone to spam you so I don't
know if he posted a hidden path in chat
now don't post rip Paul and chat you can
tweet at them how am I supposed to spam
the guy if you if I'm doing it all alone
rip Paul no F given nice no no the
hardware store it needs to know all
right so we we hit our original plan of
7400 what did I have to do what happened
what's even a thousand megahertz
apparently on the memory 195 on the the
core I should probably take a screenshot
of this before we do the next test and
crash at all so they just take a note so
we hit our original goal and passed it
34 12 that was with plus 195 plus 1000
130 percent power okay what did Paul do
on his I don't know if he sent it
Paul is plus 925 and plus 178 and I oh
he's on the ACS card that's a custom
board so that is certainly something we
need to look into as well switching to
think it's a custom board I don't have
pcs in the custom one does that run - oh
man yep there we go the Twitter bridge
okay well I need to screenshot this
before it's gone forever and then we're
gonna try and keep going Paul if you're
watching yeah he is watching he says
this isn't over it's just starting
everybody Paul are you streaming feel
free to share your link
Paul apparently says this isn't over
it's become a battle now where is this
is this how you have beefs Paul is this
a beef I don't know how to beef haha all
right so let's I forget exactly what
screenshots Hardware bought requires
well let's just get a bunch of stuff not
that this is impressive or anything but
a graphics card
we don't need sensors need a graphics
card we need CPU Z a bunch of of CPU Z's
so we're at 70 for 12 so the original
goal has been acheived it was 7400 throw
down a district yes
he says I'm I'm only just learning to be
myself
Paul has in Chad thank you Paul for
joining the original the original goal
was achieved and this would be nearing
the end of the stream under those
guidelines however we must now defend
our honor against Paul Paul are you
using a custom PCB is that a C's card
custom piece of years that reverence I
don't know we gotta like organize this
next time and get multiple media
battling or something alright this is
this is pretty cool okay so screenshot
needs to be done
we need CPU tab open I mean memory and I
think we need mainboard I'm pretty sure
that's all they want and we need the
score but I don't have a full score
though just grab it's actually I can't
even submit the score whatever that's
fine
I'll screenshot it for myself memory K
mainboard
okay this will help keep track of our
own settings for the future I guess
let's get this kind of in there okay
cool that did not do what I want it to
do
let's get this over I don't have any
space left on the screen
for the streaming good enough so 70 for
12 and for the record graphics 147 5/7
FPS graphics 240 308 and and then we
need some more o'seas on here to here
there we go fit everything finally paint
save rip Paul number one because of
course there shall be multiple okay all
right let's get all this stuff out of
here and then let's let's go further so
I'm gonna I'm gonna go ahead and say we
got our original goal the goals have
been expanded has Paul said anything
else honey I don't think he has I need
to check
I was looking away okay all right and I
have a lot of super chats three two I'm
sorry
okay so has he Paul keep keep me a keep
me on the loop on your progress
I think we're beefing so I think I think
this is how you do it
it's normally very friendly as far as
I'm aware benchmarks so 70 for 12 Paul
was just Paul score to beat was where is
it
you've all spammed it off my Twitter
feed it was like 373 something he was at
73 something it's gone it's gone forever
73 something so we passed that but I
need to need to make sure I can sustain
a lead here
so we are using the EVGA XE ultra which
is a reference board with a better
cooler and Paul is using an asus card so
this has now become we're dragging HDS
and EVGA into our beef our turf war of
east side versus west side and I'm going
to push this up its profit crash
immediately to 10 20 megahertz on the
memory will see memory seems to be
impacting this more than anything which
is not surprising there's times by after
all so let's give that a go
see how that works this time beer
glasses by the way store not gamers max
has done at the restocked I've been
wanting them for a few weeks they are
back now in quantities of one two or
four with discounts for higher
quantities and all right so we're
battling with Paul is he he's not
streaming is he Paul's hardware is that
your YouTube URL yes I don't think he's
streaming right now we'll have to Paul
will have to arrange something in the
future and see if we can do like a dual
stream or something like that
alright I'm glad someone responded to my
rip challenge to Linus or so evidently a
different youtuber altogether okay so
five dollars Gabriel how do you theorize
envy link will work for these r-tx man
there are a lot of question about envy
link I need to test it I don't know it's
got way more bandwidth that's all I know
right now
AEK adsr five dollars I need to know now
I know I need to get out of this 980 90
I though maybe that's in response when I
was saying if you know you need an
upgrade or something take some software
solutions ten dollars the more you buy
blank blank blank blank it's mad libs
the more you buy the more your the more
you cry
five dollars Bobby patter fun crypto
pricing game Nvidia all the data they
needed on what the market will tolerate
on card pricing yep attack it
$2.00 message retracted thank you anyway
Adam Meyers 20 dollars
I'm if that EVGA oh your question was
answered so you said you were miffed at
EVGA you pre-ordered a minute one and
then after your credit card info and
checkout you clicked by and it crashed
so you about a cease and you never owned
any card other than EVGA so yeah he
answered I don't you probably saw it
this is a why it looks like an hour ago
now but email Jacob f @e BG a Comi he'll
help you out storm is even two dollars
are using a 79 TX eat no he's in a DAT
6k that's only have five gigahertz
previous livestream for overclocking
here at like five point three five or
something
two dollars most into I'm at which Power
Ranger were you growing up I don't know
the trick question
feel like I'm gonna get in trouble no
matter how I answer that Matthew account
$10 do you think this release could be
planned step two new cards and eight
months as an a refresh on 10 nanometre
fab kind of like what they did with max
while the Pascal yes I think it could
certainly be a snap in like a year to a
better card did it crash yes crashed
into so it crashed into but it crashed
gracefully which means that it is a
memory crash because that is a memory
intensive benchmark and it did crash
gracefully so that's good let's get on
ten ten megahertz on the memory so if
you're just joining or if you've been
here a while our original goal with 7400
I didn't think it happened I dropped it
seventy three hundred modified the goal
and then immediately after that we got
74 12 which was good timing because
that's right when Paul tweeted at me rip
TNF with a 73 something score and now
Paul I think is responding and said this
isn't over so I need to keep an eye on
his Twitter as well
check in check in chat the more you buy
the more of your life can be ray traced
yes that is certainly one interpretation
Paul said my ambient is 82 Fahrenheit
man 28 degrees Celsius that could be an
issue
e yes that could be an issue and now
that you have exposed your weakness to
me I shall retaliate by lowering the
temperature one degree Fahrenheit game
over Paul give up while you still have
dignity I think our ambient Slyke 71 by
the way so yes that's a bit unfair I
guess time to put a test bench in a
vacuum chamber
60 FM coming yeah that'd be good just
spend $500 on air conditioning and just
just to beat Paul Oh Paul the gloves are
off
people are saying the more you cool this
cooler you get get excellent quality
comments all right so that's not holding
we might be kind of stuck on this card I
don't know
I don't it's really not much more I can
do here no not 500 ever thought I'd be
very bad I can't do a lot more with this
this card if Paul responds with
something that outpaces this score
though I will already built that Asus
board we have on stream and let's throw
it in there it's Paul live I don't think
he is but he was in chat and if you guys
don't know who Paul is I'm sure all he
do definitely go to his channel and
subscribe he's a pretty straight shooter
on reviews and we like that like that
very much from the YouTube community
doesn't look like he's live see yes
thank you so one tweeted at me Paul's
comment in chat that actually helps a
lot because it gets buried go team Paul
man get that out of here go team Paul I
think this is
in coming studio upgrade for Paul so he
can turn the temp down to beat your
score is there general access to
precision ax 1 yet I have a pre-release
version but x1 comes out tomorrow and
beta for the public as far as I've been
told as of today so you'll get it soon
what does that say about I missed it
whatever okay so benchmark outside at
night in the desert yes well he doesn't
live in LA he's got a better option at
that than we do
looks like we crashed I think we think
we're done on the on the offsets here
that was that was a cork core crash did
not like that completely frozen so it is
stuck at 195
okay
all right so let me get through some
some chats and stuff like that while I
think about if we want to do something
if we have other options for
overclocking this mm-hmm other than
turning the AC down to 60 degrees what
results are you getting with the auto
overclock I don't know we're gonna test
that at some point but I guess we could
do that here it's not gonna be as good
as manual but I guess as long as it's
close enough that's fine for most people
freezer ice cube chunk mod I don't shunt
mods work anymore okay so all right so
anyway getting back to some housekeeping
stuff while this figures out what it's
doing with its life screen is higher res
than the bench yeah so this is that's
not offsetting that results or anything
that's a valid test it's just scalar
issue shunt mods should still work
people are saying okay we could do that
kiss opponents that anyway yeah we have
let me check the stock we had a couple
oil shirts in there of all different
sizes I think was excess - extra small -
4x
there's probably mostly gone now let's
see we still have 4x shirts we have like
a couple left we still have 2x couple of
them we still have XL larges are gone
medium is almost gone and we solve all
the extra small so he ordered extra
small just because it was I don't know
figured we'd cover all bases and I think
we've sold like one so those will be
there forever
haha but anyway not many laughs pretty
much
it's all gone at this point - X we have
the most of those are on stored our
cameras X has done that for the last
these foil shirts release the leftovers
of of our overstock that we held for
shipping purposes so Paul's score I
found it it was 73 63 and then we hit 74
12 so he's actually not that far off
Paul could kapal could come back he's
got a chance
hich he drops that dis track he might
get it I I think we're pretty stuck here
I'm going to do a little bit more
playing around with this but I don't
think we're gonna get anywhere beyond
where we already were so let's just
let's just see what happens here I don't
know we could I have plans for this card
anyway so those will help us increase
the score but I would very much like to
do it more on the stream although we did
we fish give our goal she's getting
greedy now because I want to make Paul
turn his air conditioning down by one
degree every time I do it okay that's no
CPU test run custom do we have any
background tasks no run Kosta let's just
see if it survives so anything I can do
on the cooling side of things probably
maybe a little bit like get another fan
I'm gonna get get another fan maybe just
set it up as an exhaust above it or
something maybe like a 140 before
setting up like the 3000 rpm soon on
fans
I say those for special occasions is
this gonna clip yes that will definitely
not be good for
so let's get out the secret weapon clamp
and then set up an exhaust back here if
I can
that's the wrong direction exhaust that
shouldn't clip a little precarious
considering that's leaning on a power
cable it's not really a rigid body okay
please don't please don't grind the fan
blades
knocked wire cables sir short this is
why we have so many extensions see super
chats I see him I got to get to them I
see him there and you're probably
picking up fan noise in the mic right
now sorry just plugging in an exhaust
fan that crash andrew is that up still
it's up still I'm being told all right
that's not
that's not great oh there you go it's
it's spending itself there from the
other fans is making this one spin
it's not plugged in cool that's gonna
one of those blades is gonna get
destroyed by the end of the night when
it like eats that metal clamp stay don't
all right think we're good
don't touch the table
if it works it ain't stupid now I I
think it's stupid it's still stupid
but what CPU is at eighty eighty six k
WC currency dollars thank you much I
don't know if Paul has said anything I
was busy plugging a fan in alright so if
you missed it Paul joined in and started
a blood feud we achieved our goal 7400
points but now we must fend off Paul who
is trying to take the crown and roost
putting on safety goggles in case that
fan blade II it's a metal metal shell
all right I just want to see how this
does if anything tragedy strikes when a
rogue knock to a fan explodes do you
thought that question sergeant Zeta 888
got my revolt ex dual system powers by a
head of launched by accident should I
leaked info sites yes
contact video cards and WCC F Tech and
ask them how much they'll pay you for
the information because I'm very curious
very curious how how low does the
scumball leakage go von Neumann machine
$2.00 if you had to buy today 1080i or
2080 prices in the US 1080i cuz I can
get a better a good partner model 1080i
so 1080i is my choice $150 cheaper 100
maybe kind of catching up on these super
chats sort of Marciano Manhunter 99
thank you very much can you help me a
trade zero to Samsung m2 drives on my
asus rog rampage six extreme having
problems need help what kind of problems
tweet at a wendell from level one text
he's good at that stuff and pretty
responsive on twitter definitely give
him a tweet i don't know what problems
you're having Steve be that's not it's
not me five dollars do you think drivers
will help with twenty eighty performance
and will graphics or video programs use
your r-tx technology drivers will always
help it's brand new card it's not gonna
like it's not gonna make it 30% better
in all games it might make it 30% better
in like one game if there's one where
it's dismal but oh a nice 7432 climbing
we're climbing it's going back up that
one degree drop in AC and the fan on top
was ROC here I don't even know
1,000 fighters getting like really
nitpicky now 1005 megahertz on the
memory and 195 on the core so really
we're just doing this with temperature
decreases at this point not even the
offsets anymore that might be a might be
about all we can do I kind of narrowed
it down as much as I could so score
standing is 74 32 I'm just gonna
screenshot these two windows there's
only two that oh that's got a CPU score
too they run a full test oops
screenshot these two windows okay paint
please okay so this is just gonna be my
I'm just stacking em over Paul now just
in case he responds
sorry 432 I'll just see if it'll crashed
even with that with the temperature
lower maybe it won't 200 it's probably
done I think that's it to quote King pen
professional overclocker when his Robo
clocker was having trouble surviving at
the end of the day at Computex kingpin
would get it going kind of working and
something would freeze up or hard walk
or something you know she's done ski
Steve she's done ski and then proceeded
to run around to the other side of the
booth play around with like the
internals of Robo clock or his automatic
overclocking ellentube machine and
that'd work again guys a guy is an
expert he's a lot of fun to do
overclocking with by which I mean watch
Brad Craig ten dollars just got power
back after a week in Wilmington happy to
watch without charging off my UPS thanks
for comprehensive content helped when
the lights were out and the water was
rising I really appreciate that I am
concerned if you're like sitting in your
living room and the water is like up to
your knees and you're like I have 15
minutes left of this do you have video I
isn't so long but thank you though
bazinga axe five dollars how many power
supplies have you shorted out how do I
guess we've plugged put most of them
into systems without rubber bumper
so I guess that's all of them Thomas
Brown Smith's and okay $50 what cheap
you are using when you suggest 20 atti
or 980 I for casual 1440p no 1080 in
there huh I'm doing full system upgrade
and I can wait to get all the monies if
you can wait to get that much money I
guess a 20 atti is objectively better
but for 1440p and you said casual 1440p
totally unnecessary you'd be fine with
like a 10 series or a 980 I'll do it to
Fiji water is for water cooling Steve $2
Denis hybrid it shows how far back we
are in Super chats and hey someone says
Jen vids are worth it with regard to
sitting in floodwater watching a review
vibe I accept no accountability for any
personal harm that comes from that
get your cameraman to blow on the video
card I don't I don't think that's gonna
do it at this point I am curious to see
if we can get anything else out of this
though it is kind of cold in here now so
that's probably helping a bit prices
here are nuts the 1080i in 2080 are both
at the same price 900 euros yeah it is a
bit high is this rappels ET tube went
out no we're gonna have to do something
better for that but it will come alright
so it's still going if you missed it
earlier like I've been saying we've got
the mod mats they arrived I think Friday
ish maybe Monday they write to us on
that day so that's the the modding
service I have on the table here it's an
anti-static modelling service it's got
like power pinout stuff like that it's a
product we made are very proud of it
and we believe it to be very high
quality that arrives the next shipment
of them because we have to do them in
batches arrives close to this weekend
and if you order if you have ordered
they are still available so they'll be
shipping out as soon as they come in to
us which is the next few days and we'll
carry stock up until obviously they run
out we'll order some more hopefully a
bit before then so those are there the
beer glasses were restocked and the last
of the foil shirts I think they're
pretty much gone like the limited
edition the largest are gone they'll
never be restocked that's it for those
there
gone the mediums have two left's xl's
have a few left two exes have a few
actually two exes have the most left
right now for exes there's still three
three exes three extra smalls so so I'm
apparently bought two of em thank you no
one bought extra small we had that we
ordered them just in case and no one
wanted them anyway that's what I got for
you for the the store 74 35 what was our
previous score and is at one point
higher seventy previous score 7432 so
we're three points higher that's what
we're fighting for right now we fought
for five megahertz by dropping the
ambient temperature it became a game of
literally lowering the thermostat to
increase this overclock and also putting
more fans on it so let me just walk you
through the setup I suppose the setup as
it stands now and we have to be careful
because you touch the table too hard
this fan will eat that metal clamp and
die and I should be wearing safety
goggles so I I love these test benches
specifically because the metal ones are
really cool the open bench tables but I
love these because they are it's just
like I don't know what kind of plastic
it is but it's a plastically a nylon or
something and you can you modify it
really easy so I screwed in these clamps
on it previously for the Titan V and
left them there and then we can mount
fans in it that just blast this the GPU
so that's providing air straight into
the card which helped significantly
I'll check our thermals on the next run
just so we know the temperature range
added a fan up here for exhaust off the
back plate which is helping keep the
backplate cool it's a metal backplate so
it is sinking heat so that's helpful and
for the rest we have an ax 1600 ie power
supply underneath we have an ACS Maximus
ROG board the Maximus 10 hero 8086 K CPU
at five gigahertz which is a lazy
overclock that one can do 5.35 and then
a 32 gigabytes of vengeance Alpha X
memory at 32 hundred megahertz with the
kraken X 62 cooler so that's our set up
for today and our score is 74 35 I'm
going to do
one more thing I think we can call the
score here unless Paul responds and and
beats me but I think we can kind of
start calling the score I do want to run
this and see how our do our temperatures
compared to previously with those
changes that were made midstream that's
what I want to know now so I'm just
going to monitor the therole performance
time spy okay and we'll zoom in on gpu-z
I shouldn't launch that in a windowed
mode gpu-z and read the GBO temperature
as it's running benchmarks
okay no CPU tests windowed mode no CPU
test run so let's see what it does for
temperature as this runs because the
question is how much did that help those
changes and it's probably what got us to
this this final score of 74 35
and okay
so we got got some super chats still to
go through I don't know how many there
are here all right Jason $9.99 with you
mentioning and asked Jian roughly late
winter of this year what the that the
new architecture was gonna be touring
how long have you actually know and that
terrain was going to be the architecture
yes so we knew that a little bit ahead
of the public I think since about
November of last year I knew that would
be the name and maybe October it might
be October so about a year because the
the rumor previously was was ampere I
think was the rumor 51 degrees right now
now mind you this is a really short test
it is not a thermal benchmark you should
not expect this performance because it's
it's short it's targeted but we're at 52
so it is actually a good bit lower we're
like we were about sixty previously
without any of the AC support or the
drop and the added fans things like that
so 54 53 let's see what it climbs to
frequency is directly impacted by
temperature on boost 4.0 so every couple
degrees we see scaling at like rough
maybe 710 degree I wouldn't mapped it
yet but 62 degrees we see a drop 62 63 C
drop in the 50s we see a drop at like 71
or so 79 84 and then 87 let me see hard
drops so that's kind of the frequency
scaling and for thermals and having that
extra cooling power is what got our
score the bit higher we needed it plus I
went fullscreen and stop doing windowed
and that helped as well that actually
got us a significant amount of points
you're probably gonna see this score
will drop I bet
so my constantly tabbing between them
its windowed so I score is 74 35 we're
going to call that the final score I
think this is probably going to be lower
that's what I'm what I'm curious about
so 74 35 probably the final score Paul
if you're listening I'd love you to keep
keep up the fight with your clocks if
you missed it Paul tweeted at us Patrick
came out told me check Twitter Paul
tweeted at us it's
ripped gnf and seventy-three something
points and immediately our score
finished and you pointed it out to me as
I was looking at Paul's Twitter page and
it was sunny four hundred so we've got a
beef go ahead now yeah hopefully Paul
responds as he he continues working on a
his testing I mean told Paul hit a wall
which yes we are also against the wall
at this point I will keep plugging away
after dinner damn it Paul why are you
not closer to bring some over yeah so
score drop check that out I think the
and this is not news anyone who does
overclocking but or 3dmark 7200 versus
the Saudi for what was it Sony 74 35 so
a lot of this is because I'm like
tabbing the tween stuff and its windowed
and so that ate a lot of our score early
on I think which is a something I should
keep an eye on in the future okay so a
big shout out to Paul Thank You Paul
that was fun for joining you can check
his channel out he's Paul's Hardware on
YouTube and he has Paul Hardware on
Twitter because his name was taken by a
literal hardware company and no they
don't need to know about our
overclocking score they really don't so
let me walk you through everything today
I'll try and do some of the Super chats
and I don't know how many there are
right now I'm afraid to scroll down
because I'll lose word my places let me
walk you through the stepping today so
we started with this on a recap it for
everyone really quickly start with a
founders edition RT X xx atti this one
right here from Nvidia this one took
some abuse from us when we open it up
previously but it's fine thermally so we
restored it before rebuilding it just
looks worse for where that car started
at 62 46 points so our graphics baseline
0 changes applied 0 overclocked in 62 46
out of the box and then we increase the
power target 1 22 percent to 1 23%
excuse me with maximum fan speeds that
got us 300 more point 65 18 so a bit of
a game there and gives you an idea of
what just changing the
the fan profile or primarily the power
target will get for you don't even have
to overclocked next 80 megahertz offsets
sixty seven oh six points our goal at
this point was still seventy four
hundred points which we achieved by the
way sixty seven twelve points was next
there was a plus one hundred offset
pretty disappointing at that point I was
getting worried that we would be stuck
6809 with the plus 125 so hope is
restored and then 68 68 on plus 150
which we later saw on the EVGA XD ultra
that's in the bench right now we got 68
74 with a plus 175 offset 69 47 with
plus 270 103 with a plus 200 plus 800 on
this so that is when we started getting
we got a rough 200 point gain just by
overclock in the memory plus 800
megahertz so that is with time Speights
this has been known for a while now
times wise very memory sensitive and I
believe its second test but it's one of
the two so that got us 200 points 70 120
was the score to beat on the founders
edition we could not get further than
that without like maybe adding water
would help but that's where we were
stuck that was plus 200 plus 850 then we
plugged in the EVGA XE ultra and that
one was 64 36 and Jacob if you're still
watching Jacob from EVGA we've done you
proud we got the card past the patterns
edition at the end there and I should
run this again with a full-screen pass
as well so 64 36 stock that was a bit
ahead of the founders edition stock and
then eventually we got up to plus 200 on
the core plus 1005 on the memory with a
130 percent offset and I was 70 for 35
points which also was aided by dropping
the temperature one degree just to show
Paul that I have the power to do so
because we're not in California so thank
you thank you for watching all that
stuff let me let me read through some of
the super chats as we wind down here but
we are doing a lot more tests we're
gonna be doing it live stream soon so if
you're watching now take a note we're
you doing a live stream soon of I have a
couple in mind but primary one is
building pcs or production pcs for the
office and I'm hoping to do a multicam
export to use.you so we'll have like
multiple cameras streaming to the same
stream at the same time through
a cool feature I haven't seen it use
much before Achievement Hunter uses it
and the way it works is well have
multiple cameras set up for different
like different angles or one on me one
on Patrick building systems and
absolutely multiple people on on the
screen at a time - and you have the
power to switch between the cameras as
the viewer but keep the same audio feed
on the same channels it's really cool we
just learned about it recently I don't
have a date for that yet I'm targeting
hopefully first half of next week
because we really need those production
systems but we'll see maybe like maybe
Wednesday again it will do something
like that so keep an eye out for that
twitter.com slash gamers next is to make
sure you you get a reference to or check
the top comment I always post a pin to
top comment on all the videos and if
there's a stream I know a day in advance
coming up I'll post it in that comment
so check those for the next couple days
or so I'm gonna read a couple super
chats but first thank you all very much
for watching that you were the super
chat think your picking stuff up on the
store we greatly appreciate it it has
substantially helped offset the moving
costs because they were significant so
this stream in the last one you all have
helped us greatly and in synching some
of those moving costs and now as you've
seen the last few days it's been
non-stop content production for
technical content so we're back in the
swing of things more efficient than ever
thanks to the office space producing a
lot of cool stuff super chats so we had
bazinga
10 bucks treats for a snowflake thank
you very much she would have taken the
money anyway she does oversee of course
all the financials we got it scrolled
it's gold it's all gone I try and scroll
up I'm working on it so I see a lot of
verge references in here that seems to
be the thing right now ok so I got that
888 message already here we go so I'm
roughly where we were I'm gonna miss
some of them no okay got it
Aaron Benson ten dollars so is this the
bottom line here I should keep my liquid
cooled Titan V / a22 Ti what about 220
ATT IDs in the bridge don't know I'm
testing that soon so yeah if you he says
I came in true 4k with a 120 Hertz
monitor will test it soon
Titan V is still like one of the best
cards you can own so do you really need
to make that change and we'll look in
the end viewing testing mr. Friday $5.00
I'm looking for a white 1080 TI would
you recommend the gigabyte 1080i gaming
OC knowing that a RS cards are the
premium from gigabyte a horses like
their entire brand now but I haven't
tested that specific card I can't
explicitly recommend it Nathan Kota $5
the shirt that I ordered during the last
livestream arrived today
any speculation on a for when and the e
responds with rate racing tech of their
own well first of all thank you for
getting the shirt I don't know what am
these plans are they've done like rate
racing as a marketing thing in the past
so I'm curious to see if that gets a
revival now now that there's this this
push from Nvidia but I don't know what
the response is gonna be I do hope they
have it response though because this 20
launch has been such a mess that Andy
has a serious opening to make a push and
we'd like to see more competition by
which I mean we'd like to see AMD gets
get closer to equivalents with NVIDIA
and market share to keep the market a
bit fair
Gustavo $20 hey Steve how does the r-tx
behave with video encoding same hardware
as previous gens were improvements there
was an improvement actually NB encoder -
talked about this actually we didn't
cover it at all in his review they
talked about it briefly enemy encoder
got upgrades and it is now supposed to
be better overall video quality than
previous generations so if you've been
using software encoding with CPUs and
being code is supposed to be at this
point closer to equivalence with those
especially rate like h.264 fast or
something like that so I haven't tested
it but it is supposed to have an
improvement yes Romeo 5
well ante analyst snowflake join the
stream just right there man next to the
fire extinguisher is it hidden behind
the monitor that's the closest we got
snowflakes never been allowed to join
the streams the test bench is open she
caused problems to jump on it she'll see
that it's not an AMD product and try and
sabotage it so we can't have her here
for the for the live streams
five dollars out of Meijer do you think
it's possible with the driver for tensor
cores and DLS s to be used exclusively
for rasterization just for games that do
not use it for tensor Cordiale SS to be
used for rasterization d LS s is super
sampling I don't know
no I'm gonna go with no but tensor cores
are not really meant to do that and I
don't I mean if they could be used for
rasterization I think we'd see it
already being used that way because it
give a it's a large part of the die size
so to give a performance off lift that
they need
hard core Jason $2 what lowest possible
price can we expect 10 80s probably like
500 bucks maybe 4 but I think 5 is
probably bout the lowest I don't know
you have to look Brian Giovanni $5 a
times pi it says custom what changes did
you make to the default extreme so I can
compare the only change I made if you
want to compare to what I was doing here
and Irish scored the comparative would
be 74 35 the only change I made
originally was running it with the CPU
tests off and the purpose for that is
because I knew we were only doing
graphics testing so all you do is you go
on to costume you disable CPU test and
you can just run the graphics test way
faster saves a lot of time petrol head
do you know when you're planning on
testing on vlink yes very soon very soon
hardcore Jason plans for a Halloween
stream no immediate plans for one of
those David Allen $2 why no I am the
test bench with new series cards we used
the fastest CPU so that there's no
bottleneck Gandalf
$5 you shall not pass Mary Tech miss
Steve I guess I guess it's technical had
to Iris gamers access hair wigs for our
Bald's companions please on the store no
immediate plans on theirs get a bit
weird
Caillou cats you ninja $5 turn the
voltage plus zero percent it may help
for sale voltages let's give to that $5
mr. Ebert we're getting through the
super chats really fast now getting
close to the end I think are you going
to look for at SLI at all I heard our
Teac supports and relink yes we will
revisit man there's a lot of interest in
this we'll get on that tonight IB Mike
thoughts on 1080 t is live verse 28 yeah
I've answered this question check back
really soon now that I see the absurd
level of interest here I'll start on it
immediately but I do know that some
media we're having troubles Mario $5.00
Linus is pissed about the way Nvidia did
this release do you agree what's your
opinion on the new Asus Ryu and ryujin
coolers I think those coolers are
largely gimmicks but I would agree with
Moe I don't think there were any points
I explicitly disagreed with Linus on I
thought his video was very good and he
just got a tweet or a text from Keegan
who works on the camera sometimes that
just said nerd with the screenshot of me
standing here so he can hahahaha I don't
want to tell you oh oh yeah I would use
our customary greeting of dual middle
finger fingers but I think it is
inappropriate for the stream so well I'm
just pissed about the way and videos of
the release do you agree yeah because
and video was extremely disorganized for
this launch it's like crazy because they
don't have a media pressure from AMD's
the pressure is just from my customers
they know holiday season's coming up
it's all self-imposed pressure for the
most part there are external factors but
NVIDIA is deciding to crumble to those
factors and push a product that wasn't
ready which is exactly what Linus said
and I completely agree with him on that
statement I thought their video was very
well done for this launch if you haven't
watched it and you're like Linus gross I
would encourage you to watch that one
because he has good points he talked
about some stuff that we didn't and you
have to remember Linus is like he he is
very good with the business aspect of
this stuff he's got a bit of a different
perspective and that skill set of his is
is leverage very well in the content
piece talking either in videos
positioning in the market Andrew cruise
$5 Wendell at level one tax we putting
out a deep learning bench that's cool so
there you go there's an answer to that
question from earlier
Sandman 24 blue $5 notice that the fins
are blocked between the fans and from
the back yes so on these founders cards
I think I talked about in the teardown
but they are in fact yes very typically
the way the way air works is air is
coming in the fans as you normally do
and it's got to go somewhere and so the
only place to go is up and out and down
a bit but up and out is obstructed by
this embellishment on here and all the
other embellishments on the card so yes
and Jay talked about that too there are
ways that this design can be improved
and video for whatever reason goes
really heavy on the looks I don't know
why I don't know if it's like they want
to be like Apple or what I mean it's got
70 something screws in it too so yeah
yes there is a blockage kind of in the
fins and anyone who by the way is tuning
in towards the end here we did achieve
our goal of 70 400 points we hit 70 435
on times by extreme with an EVGA XC
ultra 20 atti card Paul jumped in for a
bit he beat us we beat him and we're
waiting for him to respond so that was
kind of the end of the overclocking
portion here I'm just going through the
rest of the Super chats Martha gets $5 a
major Australian parts retailer has the
2084 1500 AUD where's 1080i at 1200 so I
guess the 1080i would be worth it down
here yes if you're spending that kind of
money anyway and it's one of those two
cards it looks like you according to you
save 300 bucks
Australian that's that's how it's good
to me the 1080i is a 20-18 so far as
performance today that might change as
they push drivers things like that it
could change but it's not going to
change that much so yeah I would say the
300 bucks mr. Friday second try looking
for a white 1080i do you recommend the
white gigabyte gaming OC yeah so I
answered that one earlier and I know
that Galax have some white cards as well
you could paint one yourself I haven't
used that specific gigabyte card most of
their cards of that class I know which
one you're talking about they're
normally fine I don't know how the vrm
contact is or how the V arm quality so
you're just looking for like a white
1080i honestly it's not gonna matter
that much like we're not doing anything
crazy with an overclock you're not
putting it in a hot box case it's
probably okay
five dollars a ek a GSR is there is this
a thermal difference for the advantage
or something else when overclocking this
thermal difference is a big part of why
we got the square we did the windowed
mode was a big big part of why the score
increased so much there was like a
hundred plus points so that was a big
deal as well chip quality between Paul
and my chip that that would also impact
our results but I don't know whose is
better right now we didn't really look
into it
wen Hsiu and five guys do it live
hashtag that is what we were doing i'll
stream commands i roll it good to see
you again commands our commands are
loaned us the Titan X originally years
ago which was awesome he he we had no
access to the card he shipped it to
hotel we were staying at in London cuz
he lives in England
shipped it to that hotel and we had like
a two-day window to grab it
so had all awayand I got it we were
there for an event took it home mailed
it back and did all of our tight necks
testing on that so commander thank you
for that I will not forget that $2
though and asked are you able to do a
shunt mod on the 28th yeah I've been
told by chat that you are I have not
tried it yet Samsonite's dove 50 DKK if
you're not having luck OC and try using
irrational numbers considering the cost
it would be fitting well played that was
a good one well played
Oh Shack Shukla 400 I don't know that
currency symbol what value if any is
there if a basic non r-tx non f e 28 ET
i cost approximately $1,500 here i've
always purchased the best consumer jeep
year since antiquity but this time even
i am forced to think is it too much
that's that's interesting that's
interesting to me because that shows
that nvidia is potentially pushing away
they're getting into a territory where
even their highest end buyers like I
don't know man that's a bit high is it
too much
yeah it is too much it's too much it
cost too much their price is way too
high on it so I yeah I agree with your
thinking that's exactly the thing you
should have and hopefully and video will
figure it out and drop it
silver $5 so where do you think the 2070
will land above
1080 no idea I can't remember this back
to the 2070 it's been 20 80s and TI's
all week but I would assume closed yeah
I don't think it's gonna be that
impressive bill want Chavo $5.00 tell
Andrew he has a good cameraman and 3d
modeller there's the meme that I was
trying to remember earlier the one that
started the two streams ago $5.00 David
tally anyway how many more of these are
there I gotta like highlight this one
any idea if extra GD DRH p.m. we can be
used as additional RAM love the content
great work extra GTD R and H p.m. as
like system Ram no I guess there's like
oh we go there's a lot of there's like
heterogeneous memory stuff that a and he
was doing with AP use and and cpus and
gpus a while ago I don't really know the
answers not really
Jeff housing or $20 this channel is
great keep it up
I thought the GDR six had
error-correcting pushing too far amaze a
great performance is that right I have
to check on the air correct thing but
pushing too far does degrade performance
on most of these devices because like at
some point you do actually it might look
like you have a thousand records offset
but can be like spewing memory errors
and you'll eventually hit a crash so
yeah pushing like if it's stable and
it's not crashing that doesn't mean it's
actually producing good data and can
drag the scores down if you do an actual
work with it not benchmarking it can
cause problems there 2 shens o 85 $5 do
you think ray chasin will make a bigger
difference to immersion in VR than it
will to gaming on a monitor I'm gonna go
with yes on this hypothetical but it's a
hypothetical because VR is already so
difficult to push adding like ray
tracing to it I don't know I mean I
guess is if it's all done off core or
off out of the FP use and it's just on
I'm like RT core isn't answer then I
guess it's doable but yeah I would think
so I've been told also that the twenty
series is better with VR than ten series
I haven't tested it I don't know if I
have like I don't know if there's enough
interest where it too large from boom
the viewer The Verge guy called PCM are
a group of angry nerds I mean he's right
like that is kind of what reddit is
comprised of yeah seems accurate Marco
Mascaro asus strix 2080 TI has 22 pin oh
I got that one already
oh you mean 22 pins like for power is
that what the question was earlier
that's not right is it to eight pins in
one six pin I have to look at the card I
don't know
one second let me look I'll show you the
Asus Strix PCB while we're on stream
still here I need this card does it no
it doesn't have 22 pins
it's got to whatever help bring it out
there anyway so it's to eight pins maybe
it's a different board that you're
talking about I don't know all the
boards yet this is the one that I have
though if you want to see it is it
really how many people are in here right
now one second I got to put this down so
we have a teardown coming up on this
card tomorrow but you got a preview I
guess if you if you hunt out and chat
this lawn you get some cream some extra
information and it's gonna be the POW
3,000 people still here that's cool
thank you
so here's your preview for sticking
around we very much appreciate it but
that's the PCB and already did the
teardown that's coming up tomorrow
I guess I'll delete this yeah that's
coming up tomorrow so it is a why this
is the one flies been like God in the
office has been living here for two days
now so this has a custom PCB unlike some
of the others we've looked at it is it's
got a split piece or vrm just like with
the reference design that we saw but
they've rotated these two which I talked
about this in the video tomorrow on more
depth but it's for a future design and I
can't can't say more than that right now
the it's missing the same memory module
is the others if you keeping track or
you're curious like K is that a k1 it's
k1 skew on the die and it also has two
eight pins it's got that big that is not
twenty-two pin so yeah you guys Wentz
been talking about something else when
you're asked about twenty-two pin
earlier sorry I missed that it's got
these fan connectors over here it opens
up really nicely like a book so they
stay connected you just pop them out
it's these are like the safest I've
disconnected recently a lot of the fan
headers kind of stuck on these things
that are easy to break and I think that
covers most of it we build joys working
on a PCB analysis whereas it's got some
caps on the backside there's a couple of
small ICSI some of these stuff like that
it's got a button for stealth mode they
call
which just goes into a it just turns out
he's off that's all it does and then it
has a switch I think yes it has a switch
at the top up here for performance mode
and quiet mode which it is currently in
performance mode towards the back is
performance mode and towards the Front's
quiet so that's dual BIOS switch then an
LED on the back and I think that's
pretty much everything on the card that
I'll talk about right now cooler is
interesting to talk about that in the
video tomorrow but that's the HDS board
so if you stuck around thanks for
sticking around there's here's what you
get for doing so
Griselda Vaughn Jolie 50 SEK I have a
double 1080i in the unique build there's
a short clip on my channel do you do
1080i so I keep up better than 20 atti
single it's gonna I'm turning the air
back up because we don't need to show
off the paul anymore it's freezing the
1080i to only be better in SLI and James
would support it and I don't know if
that's even true have to test it got the
how many hours you put into testing
question already it was a lot for this
for the 20 series cards it was like in
the first four days of testing it was 64
hours
it's just 67% of all hours wanted to
testing that kept track and then I
forget I went through dollar earlier it
was a lot okay I have to call it at some
point but I'll keep reading some of
these Tom five Tom entertainment RTX on
two hours Thank You Raj bill one child
two dollars will you still take more CBS
for you wall art I don't know we we have
more boxes I need to open so unless
they're really unique maybe hold them
for now and then when we do the next
like fan mail open anything I'll see how
many we have and see if we have enough
to make that that pixel art logo and let
everyone know if we need more of your
garbage to build that with dr. Knapp $5
the best I run out of my 1080i FCW three
hybrid tonight is 4868 2080 TI is
expensive but damn 7200 plus I'm keeping
my 20 80 TI FTW three pre-order
there you get I mean yeah if that
performance score is important to you I
guess it does what the 1080 I can't it
is expensive though empyrion DKK 20 is
both of the XC are both AXI cards able
to hit 130 percent yes they are you need
a BIOS well you won't need a BIOS update
I needed BIOS a day because their
prerelease but yes
Abhishek said what value if any is there
on a non answer that I answered that one
earlier trans waters $5 greetings from
Charleston South Carolina
hello I am looking to liquid cool
eventually be a custom loop would you go
reference card like aces dual or custom
like Strix if there's a water block
that's a reasonable price for Strix then
even that like I guess you're looking at
a higher power target and that's kind of
the advantage because the reference
boards have kind of a little power
target I don't know what this thing has
yet I'll check and find out build
towards got a fucking fly
PCB analysis coming up soon within the
next few days not tomorrow or the next
few days he'll have one check that it's
Jango $2 tech Jesus please a blessed by
his soul blessed be thy hardware as
center- $4.99 if the specific parts of
the GPU pipeline used for ray tracing
aren't yet available if it gets here you
are they effectively disabled or still
drawing power in cycle okay gotcha if
they so it's like anything else the SMS
for example SMS on just like the GPU
core they contain the F fuse ie the CUDA
cores they contain cache they contain TM
use they contain Rob's they contain
memory controllers all that stuff's and
SMS and GPUs and stuff like that so it's
the same idea there where if the unit's
not being used it is not drawing power
or at least not a meaningful amount so
the SMS well this is why they're grouped
into G pcs TBC's I think it's MTV TBC's
SM so forth because if you have like one
TBC with 2's
in it for example then one of those
items might be active working on
something you got a command and
operation down the pipe it kind of looks
at all the different units that has
available is what workers are available
and we'll target one in a fashion that
is beneficial to power consumption so if
you can keep like a couple items asleep
they'll stay asleep it'll push off the
load to something that's maybe already
spin spun up and so the idea is just
like with tents recorders RT cords if
it's not being used then the command
processes are at the very top that sends
all the commands down the pipe through
GP CT PCs and so forth should issue that
they stay asleep and until it's woken up
for a specific command it will stay
asleep so they shouldn't be drawing any
power just like when you're if you're
like if I'm running this at 50% load in
a game then it's not gonna be drawing
107 power it'll be drawing less maybe
not proportionate proportional but it
will be drawing less bill on child 100
bucks Congrats on the score Steve keep
up the good work thank you Bill that's a
lot of money thank you very much and
then he followed up two dollars ripped
Paul there he go it was worth it with
him hearten C 1 2 3 $5 rip Paul know
after givin all right did I don't think
Paul Paul spry still eating dinner right
did they did he respond anyone see if
Paul worked out in the setting where is
he
he's still taking a break he took a
break this is a probably the best I can
do for now I didn't beat Steve but I
broke 7,400 nice nicely done Paul what
did he get paul got sony 401 damn 34
points away got to be careful
but the best wash out Paul 70 401
everyone saying okay well we'll keep
this going
I'm sure he'll he'll beat it he's only
34 points away he can beat it eventually
okay getting close to the end of the
super chat unless he keeps sending them
but I'm gonna have to cut it off at some
points and be aware of that
AEK a GSR $2.00 was the difference
between cars and thermals partly yes I
think I answered that Brock says fire
laws enjoy some Cheerwine since I can't
here in Oklahoma I'm so sorry for your
loss
we will definitely do that but PI put
$1.99 cut your hair for me
no thanks mechanical flaw $5 any news
from ekw be thinking their pricing is
high to get rid of the Pascal cards
first I don't know anything about the
pricing I know that oh who is it water
cool water cool is working on some
blocks alpha cool is working on blocks I
don't know what he Kate's doing I think
they have some Richard Hardman $2 well
the 1080 blocks at the 2018 Oh boom $2
are you sure you're not using a 1792 XE
yep pretty sure Tennessee on $5 thank
you for streaming with r-tx on
I can't go back hashtag just buy hit the
verge and Tom's and like a two-week
period created all of the references for
the future Dustin I have $5 please crank
your CPU overclock see how it effects
did you be scored now it wasn't worth it
unbeaten r-tx smackdown featuring Robo
clock or Tech Jesus Paul s and NVIDIA
Tom cage match it'd be pretty fun I'd
like to I don't know Paul you're welcome
to come out here if you want I you out
we'll do an OC battle or something we do
some other content there but that would
be fun we are trying to get kingpin out
here the creator of Robo clocker but I
don't think Robo clocker will be coming
with him oil shirt just bought it thank
you very much you got one of the the
last few I think they're pretty much
gone what's even left those I think
that's it I think that's it for the
limited edition much left there's two
extra smalls left we start with five of
those because no one bought them we
bought them thinking that someone might
want them fortunately people tell people
bottom two of those left you have a
couple xl's still have the most 2x guess
we've ever bought those a bit and then
we have three four X's so that's it and
small medium large and 3x are all gone
XS is almost gone and XL is almost gone
but thank you for buying one okay isn't
the stuff on the stock PCB already
overkill what can be better than the on
the XE - PCB
well the EXCI old try having there
nothing cuz it is a reference PCB the
xe2
is an IC X card so it's got thermistors
on it if you like it the NTC thermistors
for IC x it's kind of cool we'll have to
look at the rest I don't know that's
kind of what buildings point was and the
PCB analysis we posted was it's it's
really hard for partners to beat like
this it's just the prm's good and video
is doing a good job with their vrm and
it's a little weird because it's
something we want to see that's good for
water cooling and stuff but also with
the dual axial change - you start the
question why are they suddenly working
so hard on making a good reference model
and and how are they pushing out board
partners for the same types of cards and
also just for the record she EVGA is
representative messaged me and said
Congrats wait till you get the kingpin
card so maybe it'll happen
all right I'm gonna cap this in like
eight minutes that's what we're gonna do
I would read as many as I can in eight
minutes if I don't get to you I'm so
sorry but there are a lot of them I hope
you can understand it's just not
possible to do like everything it will
call it ten I might be able to do
everything
haha okay so let's where is it okay I'm
gonna try and do as many if not all
these like Han don't send any more
stupid chats I'm not gonna get to it I
mean if you want to you that's cool
thank you but a mark probably I can get
to the question or the comment so we got
Tyler $5.00 I've got a Titan X Pascal I
live to push the limits on my rig it can
or should I haz Cheezburger what is that
at 128 ET I guess if you can afford it
if you can afford cheeseburger sure
Hector Garcia $5 keep up the good work
would be worth to switch from an msi
1080 TI fe to an EVGA 1080i FTW 3 or
some TI water-cooled no unless you can
like Salyer unless you can sell to a
point where you're you're like what your
is a magnitude of 50 or $100 and not
700-plus then that would be worth it I
guess well on shoe Johnson - sneaky
keyboard or sneaky board excuse me for
one Janet there you go
Paul's followers have infiltrated chat
the Martin see one two three $5 my 1080i
is struggling with Shadow the Tomb
Raider 4k Ultra FPS 32 50s
Willie test terrain SLI efficiency in
the near future yes also voting for
after stream ice cream I agree with you
my throat's Dynes that sounds good
WC current $2.00 but what cpu is it it's
an ad 86 K Mario Soto $10 go borrow J's
two cents AC set up for cooling is it
good did he like pointed out a computer
or something which Brown $5 Beetle Bug
Adventure Racing wouldn't be able to run
4k 60fps on 20 atti and I've them at $5
Steve have you tested and be like a tall
man this is popular any different than
normal SLI does it make one logical GP
like GV 100 I don't think so but I'm not
sure I think that's like that's what
makes it cool on GV 100 I would assume
you I don't know that's probably
information that's already out there
maybe someone in chat can answer that I
think it's out there but yeah well we'll
see very soon I'll just look myself
teeth is all $5 what kind of table are
you using for this build according to
the verge it's a big deal you said huh
yes we only want the best tables for our
PC builds because it's the most it's the
first part they listed that you need
this is actually a Uline table that was
used so bad and Jarrett times are you
getting the RG strict version two
benchmarks - yes I showed it to you
earlier so hopefully that can help you
decide any choices
Brecon Scott five dollars I bet my
yogurts later can get more FPS at 1080p
I don't don't know what that means
Midori is $10 you and build Zoid first
linus and j and head-to-head live OC but
done kitchen show style were you running
grab parts of the build leave the cool
intact to each team then live or live I
don't know our live stream yeah it'll be
fun that's a good luck getting like
builds Lloyd - Jay
than me all in the same room I guess
tourer maximum is $5 it met you at LTX
had the EVGA mousepad with everyone's
autographs I remember that that was
pretty cool
started watching you ever since in love
your content thank you very much that is
awesome to hear we liked LTX and we'll
probably try to be back next year I
think some software solutions here's the
$5 to cover three drops of liquid metal
for the shunt mod thanks fortunately
have some production out right here so
we get on that and then we got a Midori
is courtesy of Galvin called the
competition PC master-race
white bear five dollars you should take
that back take back that dig you made
out the verge yesterday you were a
professional
I mean look man the verge that video was
deserving of some jokes it wasn't a
personal attack of the guy in the video
the verge is a professional publication
I'll remind you with far greater reach
than we could ever dream to have and as
a professional publication they also
have a responsibility to their viewers
and users which is to you know like make
sure that you know something as basic as
zip ties are not tweezers I mean come on
come on I can understand not knowing
anything on overclocking I can
understand like hey this is my first
time building PC I haven't done it
before let's learn together I get that
that's cool it's really awesome they
want to grow the community if they do
that but dude zip ties are tweezers and
use an allen key to build your PC like
give me hip break
pray also the verge did one of their
video directors didn't tweet a few digs
at youtubers in August so I don't want
to tell you but they they did not make
friends in the community wolf eats two
to five four or five dollars what do you
think about graphics card rental
services I think it's really interesting
I've never used one though but
interesting nonetheless
exotic simplicity two dollars no message
Thank You Loic billing dirt five dollars
do you think Artie can be supported by
a secondary PhysX card man we're getting
close to the end here thank you for
slowing those down for me I think we're
gonna make it we'll make through all of
them no I don't think it can be mad
arias could they be holding performance
back till extra 1080 eyes Sal also
snagged the shirt thank you for grabbing
a shirt store tie Karen's axis thought
that if you want to grab any of this
stuff there like the beer glasses that
we use talk
could they be holding forth back I don't
subscribe to that particular conspiracy
theory
I don't think so I like think of and
sabotage their launch to a point where
the lioness and Jay and consumer-facing
media are criticizing the product I
don't think so
that seems crazy Pedro Palazzo I crazy
for them to do mine's not a crazy
conspiracy theory because they're been
things crazier than that Vega frontier
for blender about 550 you Steve Wow
16 gigabytes of HBO makes it seem good
if you're doing stuff that uses that
much memory and your biggest bottleneck
is memory then that sounds good to me
but only then Norman when will you test
enemy link on the 8086 or will test some
980 86 unless it is a CPU bottleneck
we'll find out fast pedra answer your
question shark with manners $24 hi Steve
just woke up it's 335 the morning here
in the UK and also bought a foil shirt
cobalt glasses and another blue Heather
t-shirt Wow thank you very much all I
did was get up for a cigarette but
totally worth it well thank you for the
support shark with manners you certainly
do have some manners I can't verify the
shark part though and then only a couple
more awesome
Douglas M 499 working hard right now so
I cannot watch the stream live but I
wanted to pop in and say hi hi Douglas
thank you for the five bucks and hope
your work is going well we've $10 10 DS
for daddy that's weird but I I'll eat
the chicken tenders anyway bill one
trial a $2.00 spamming super chats right
now and I'm a peace and love peace and
love no more super chats please okay
we've got to the end okay it's all just
spam now I don't read the last real
question and then no more Treyarch PvP
hey Steve I'm debating the next graphics
card to purchase I
a 970 FTW at the moment but don't know
whether to go with a 2080 or a 1080 TI
if the price in your region favor is the
1080i being cheaper by $100 or greater
than the 1080i is a good way to save
money look at your financial situation
but that's where I would go if they're
the same price the 2080 but otherwise
1080i if it's cheaper like it is here
yeah I get that one so okay that's it we
made it through all them there's still
2800 of you here some reason but thank
you for watching the live stream was a
lot of fun the card hit 74 35 points we
got plus 200 plus 1000 five offset four
core and memory respectively hundred 30%
power offset for power target for the
EVGA actually ultra with this card it's
any 120 buddies rerun it with the the
test not in windowed mode apparently and
yeah so great scores overall modified it
a bit with some Noctua fans just kind of
precariously sitting on there that's it
for this one though yeah subscribe for
more we have another stream coming up
sometime next week
building pcs for the production room
should be a lot of fun really enjoyed
the chat interaction and the super chats
and thank you for the storage is all
that stuff Paul I'm looking forward to
continuing our beef I hope you get
another 34 points on your score so that
I can have a reason to respond I just
want I just want a friend Paul Linus
didn't want to be my friend he never
responded to my repel TT challenge so I
left here with your attempt at
overclocking and I hope you can be there
so we can come back at it thanks for
watching everyone subscribe for more go
