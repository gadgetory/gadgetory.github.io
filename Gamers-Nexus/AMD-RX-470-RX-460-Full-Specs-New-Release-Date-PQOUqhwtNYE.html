prefer GPUs in the 100 to 300 dollar
range pretty fair bet I think they were
saying about eighty four percent of
their buyers are in that range and so
with Polaris their focus shifted away
from halo products like the high-end
stuff down to more mainstream focused
segments and that makes sense for a
company trying to fight where they can
make the most money so that's what
Andy's looking at for the RX 470 and 460
which as of today we have a little bit
more news for you but it's not that much
more over the review of the RX 480 which
had a table for specs of the 417 460 in
it if you did not see that the 480 is
being left to focus on 1440p gaming and
the 470 is looking at the 1080p segment
first the RX for 70 is the polaris 10
GPU and has the same architecture as the
RX 480 including compute preemption and
asynchronous shaders but it is a
cut-down version in terms of stream
processor count and the clock rate the
RX 470 will host 32 is see used as
opposed to the 36 use of the RX 480 and
that puts us at 2048 stream processors
knowing that each see you has 64 stream
processors this isn't actually new
information so they didn't officially
say this thing has 2048 stream
processors previously but it was pretty
obvious because they did tell somebody
to use a head so that was calculable
pretty easily the new stuff though is
the clock rate so the RX 470 will
operate at 1206 megahertz boosted and
926 base and that's what the 2048
processors it's got 128 TM user texture
map units on the 470 and for perspective
the 480 had 144 of those TM use its
operating with 32 ROPS and memory
operates on a 256-bit interface with a
6.6 gigabit per second affective memory
speed it's hosting 4 gigabytes of gddr5
and that's with a 211 gigabyte per
second memory bandwidth display
interfaces include the hdmi 2.0 spec and
DisplayPort support for HDR and HB r 3
up to 1.4 DisplayPort and TDP is listed
as 121
wats just as a reminder don't fall for
the trap that a lot of people fall for
you cannot compare TDP cross
architecture or across brand so when we
talk about a 120 watt TDP for the RX 470
you can't turn around and say that's
equal to whatever nvidia cards may have
a 120 watt TDP of 1060 what have you or
150 watt as the case may be this is more
of a measurement of the cooling
potential required to keep that or the
cooling power required to keep the chip
at a manageable temperature it's not
just plug it into a no scope and the
output is 120 watts it's not how it
works so you will need to look for our
power testing with the 474 a look at its
actual power draw just as you'd have to
look at it for the 1060 or what have you
but TDP is 120 watts the only thing you
can compare that against is internal
brand internal architecture tdps that
would be against the 480 or something
like that in terms of the memory
subsystem the RX 470 has the same memory
subsystem as our X 480 so that means
it's got the same Delta color
compression it has other similar
optimizations in the memory pipeline
that reduce the power consumption of
memory and a non trivial way is forty
percent lower power or so versus
previous generations and that helps with
the overall reduction of power and that
lower TDP we're talking about Delta
color compression is the same the way
the memory works is the same as the 480
so only thing that's really changed here
is the capacity the bit width and things
like that for the interface and in terms
of the release date the RX 470 will be
available effective on August fourth and
the price is undetermined ahem the
decided to do another news announcement
of these cards because they missed their
mid-july and end of July release dates
pretty standard in some regard for these
these types of products but they missed
those release dates they put out into
the other news announcement today with
the TMU account things like that but the
price is not yet known in terms of
performance AMD is saying that the 470
should be about 1.5 x faster than the
270 which is two generations old now one
to depend on how you count the
architectures so 1.5 x over that we
have the card yet but hopefully we'll
get one for review the RX 460 will be on
Polaris 11 it's got 14 C use with 896
stream processors and it's clocked at
twelve hundred megahertz of boost and
1090 base the RX 460 will have 50 60 M
use and 16 rob's so it's about half of
what we're seeing for the most part of
the 470 and performance is up to 2.2
teraflops again Polaris 11 kind of
indicates that memory runs at an
effective seven gigabits per second on
two gigabytes or four gigabytes of gddr5
with the interface 128 bits wide that
puts memory bandwidth by the way at 112
gigabytes per second we've seen some
confusion lately as well as to how
memory bandwidth is calculated to just
as a reminder it's pretty simple but you
have to do it right order first divide
the bus width and bits by eight that
converts bits two bytes eight bits in a
byte and then multiply the actual memory
speed not the same as the effect of
speed we see here which is seven
gigabits per second multiplied the
actual memory speed by the quotients of
whatever the interface / 8 equals you
multiply those numbers then you multiply
again by 24 DDR and then again by 24
gddr5 which gives us 112 gigabytes per
second TDP for the RX 460 is it less
than 75 watts so it can function
entirely off of PCIe and price for this
card is also unknown it will be
releasing on august eighth we should
have the price for you hopefully a day
or two before then but if it's not
something we can publish yet then I
guess you'll know about it on launch day
so August eighth for the 460 that's the
low end card and August fourth for the
470 which is sorta low end but in that
mid-range market I would assume closer
to one hundred fifty dollars for the 470
which would put it in competition with
Nvidia's at 950 at least as of today and
the 460 is probably going to be closer
to competition was something like the
750 Ti in terms of just a brand versus
brand stack up notebooks are also
important though so with the 980 and
video was able to move that chip to
notebooks in its entirety there was not
a cut-down version of
980 and Andy is doing the same thing now
this is because the TDP of these chips
these days is lowering enough that can
be put into a laptop without making an M
version ie9 ATM or for ATM or what what
have you so that's been kind of moved
away from Andy is going to be bringing
its full Polaris chips the 417 460
certainly into laptops and they're not
cut down models the notebooks will have
a lower TDP on the chip versus the
desktop counterparts just nature of
thermal throttling and concerns with
laptops pretty normal stuff so it's it
is on the manufacturers to make sure
these laptops are cooled of course as
always but the TDP is low enough that
they're ditching the M suffix for this
at least immediate stack up of GPUs
coming out so they'll be leveraging the
417 462 hopefully regains on that
notebook arena that's been basically all
intel and nvidia the last few years in
BO smarter than a couple of APU products
as far as testing I'm hoping to look at
both 4 &amp;amp; 2 gigabyte versions of the 460
so that we can see what that difference
actually looks like in the real world
kind of like we did with the 484 and 8
gigabyte versions I'm thinking it'll
probably ROPS limited and that 2
gigabytes is about where we'll see peak
performance though there may be some
titles where 4 gigabytes makes sense for
one percent loads and things like that
so you can see our RX 488 vs. 4
gigabytes benchmark for a look at that
in terms of the rest of this stuff
that's that's really where we're at with
this so its fourth and eighth is what
you need to look out for waiting on
pricing information as always pay tronic
