they always do at their presentation at
the time of filming last night which was
about the Nintendo switch so strictly
speaking to hardware specifications as
is typical for Nintendo we really didn't
get a whole lot and I can't say that's
too surprising unfortunately but they
announced some game titles things like
that they talked about some very basic
hardware specifications we've taken what
was shown what we could find on their
website analyzed it a bit further and
hopefully have a fuller picture as to
what the switch will be capable of and
then we've got a pre-order coming as
well for some further content before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by Thermaltake and their core p1
tge mini ITX chassis which will be
available sometime soon in the first
half of this year link the description
below for more information before
getting to all the notes from the press
conference just some anecdotal
experience with trying to get a switch
the Nintendo switch we're getting one
for a full analysis the plan is to do
some hardware capture do framerate
analysis using some advanced PC hardware
see if they deliver the framerate the
promising which is 60fps analyse the
frame data all that stuff and probably
tear into the device at a more I guess
intrinsically hood just completely pull
it apart and see how that goes so we'll
have all that on camera
probably on launch day but getting the
switch is not going to be trivial so if
you are dying for one of these you would
you probably should have already
pre-ordered one I would say as we always
do wait for reviews and things like that
before you actually buy anything because
pre-orders are a great way to get money
when you may not have wanted to actually
spend it if you had full information but
just to give you an idea of what it's
like the I have to go to a physical
location to pre-order it was not really
guaranteed available online anywhere and
that location had 19 available seven of
which were reserved for store employees
so there's not going to be a lot of
these things I have a feeling we're
going to be seeing the same headline as
we saw with the Wii which was we sold
out just for a long time until then said
refreshes stock
so that's certainly
I don't know I guess kind of a point of
concern but also probably a good thing
for Nintendo because they'll look good
for them to investors but let's get into
the hardware notes first thing to get
into probably is the main device of the
dock so you the device is just a
handheld
we've talked about it before it pulls
out of the dock you can use it
effectively as about a tablet size
handheld gaming device kind of like a
3ds that's bigger and that has the two
controllers that it's a GOG patch
everyone pretty much knows that at this
point and if you don't we have previous
coverage that talks about it the device
uses rails to mount the two controllers
the Joye con controllers to the side of
the switch and then the switch can mount
into a dock the way it docks is by USB
type-c so this is not some proprietary
special connector on the bottom of the
switch it just uses a straight USB
type-c I guess it probably protrudes out
of the bottom or has a cover or
something like that we can really see it
fully and it docks down in which has I
would assume a male connector USB type-c
ladakh that dock I think if you buy it
separately if yours is damaged or
something that's selling for something
like $90 which is insane but they're
probably the only people who are going
to make it so they can get away with it
so that's what the dock does it has HDMI
out it has one USB type-c port used for
charging data transfer things like that
it has two USB 2.0 ports on the side and
on the back of the dock there is another
USB port but it's not specified what
generation that is it does however look
like USB 3 strictly because the header
is blue but they can color it blue if
they wanted to not actually be USB 3 so
there's no guarantee on that that is
what it looks like though so that's the
dock the Joye cons there is an update to
those that we didn't have previously
there's a new mode called HD Rumble that
Nintendo today frankly horrible job
explaining in the presentation they
basically I will try and use a clip here
and explain it we can't use too much
because Nintendo is they have problems
with YouTube but they basically showed a
switch joique on controller next to a
glass of water with ice in it and said
that if you hold
the controller it feels like there's an
ice cube inside of it and also if
there's sometimes it can feel like
they're two ice cubes in it that's
complete Jose HD rumble my takeaway from
that is that they're saying that it
sounds like there's a positional rumble
where if you have a rumble effect
triggered by the game it can trigger to
a certain point in the controller that's
my takeaway there ice cubes is a way of
saying multiple rumble points my
controller the water I'm not sure what
that represents it looks like more
weight or something but or maybe I don't
know I have no idea that just behind but
I think it's multiple rumble points
motion sensor there's a motion sensor
present similar to the Wiimote motion
plus there is an NFC reader if you use
amiibos capture and share button like
the ps4 there's an IR motion camera on
the bottom right of the joy con and that
can be used for a basically input
detection gesture detection from if you
have hand gestures and things like that
it'll pick them up I'm not sure how
that'll be deployed just yet there is no
d-pad and I quote our video editor and
then tenda created it and then pendo can
take it away so there's no d-pad they
created it on the NES and it is gone on
the switch SL and s our buttons are
available when held sideways that may
not be immediately obvious it's getting
some more interesting stuff though I'm
going to skip a few sections of this
we'll come back to them the SOC we'll
get to the storage and memory is
probably the most immediately while so
saying that we have the most information
for Nintendo uses the phrase internal
memory for their 32 gigabytes basis
allowance those of you know computer
hardware this is not memory like we know
it's not RAM they're just saying it's
internal storage so there's 32 gigabytes
of storage internally it is almost
certainly soldered to the board and it
is probably some type of well it is
definitely some type of flash memory
what type of flash memory hopefully
we'll we'll find out when we tear it to
pieces and see if it's mlc or TLC or
whatever and see if there's any
concerns the next point is that this is
expandable you can add SDXC cards SDXC
goes up to 2 terabytes that doesn't mean
that all of the systems and
architectures support 2 terabytes now
and as a software supports it so what
they support they don't specify but I'm
hoping we'll be able to internally test
at least 128 maybe 256 gigabytes I am
going to try to get larger SD cards on
loan and see if we can validate just how
large you can support if Nintendo
doesn't tell us beforehand which they
probably won't the game cards are
separate from SD card so there are two
points where the cards Mountain is the
device there's a proprietary form factor
SD card sort of sized cards like a
cartridge that mounts on the top of the
switch and then normal SD cards connect
to the bottom pretty straightforward
there Internet connectivity we are
looking at 802 dot 11ac wireless that's
a good thing I don't know what their
maximum throughput is but AC wireless
can theoretically do something like 1.3
gigabits per second normally but not all
AC devices do that some of them are
limited to something like 350 megabits
per second it just depends on the device
and the limitations of the i/o in the
system itself but that's the plan 802 11
AC Ethernet support is available when
docked but you have to use a USB to rj45
adapter similar to Wii U I'm I guess I
understand why they do it it's fewer
things to put on the box it is kind of
annoying but you could do it if you
wanted to 8 switch devices so 8 min
pendo switches can be connected locally
probably via ad-hoc network they do not
specify if it's how the frequencies and
interferences may come into play with
all of those different controllers and
players and switch devices I would
assume it's an ad hoc wireless network
though to create basically a land
between the 8 devices there is a paid
online service this is important so the
free trial will be from March to fall of
2017 we don't know what it'll cost right
now and we also don't know if you will
have online internet access without
their paid search
I don't know if that's going to provide
something extra versus just normal web
browsing the screen so the screen is a
6.2 inch IPS panel it is a multi-touch
capacitive screen we know these things
for sure what we don't know for sure is
what Eurogamer via digital foundry
stated earlier or what gets last year
now December which was that the screen
will have ten point multi-touch that has
not been confirmed by Nintendo but
there's no reason not to believe it at
this point in time multi-touch is there
though unlike Wii U it will be a 720p
screen so 1280 by 720 and that will
display at 60fps it can output to 1080p
so if you connect the HDMI to a TV you
get a 1080p output that limitation is
because of the GPU clock scaling which
we'll talk about in a moment the I guess
what's really is it's all there to say
on the screen for the most part now
we'll be intercepting the frames though
to see what the FPS actually is and see
if they deliver on their promises
because consoles do have a long history
of not doing that because it's not an
easy way to validate in the console
itself but we have capture cards and we
have the whole thing set up and ready to
go the SOC so we know that it will be a
custom Tegra SOC that will be either
Pascal or Maxwell signs point to Maxwell
right now based entirely on digital
boundaries leaks I suppose that they
posted in December there's we can't
validate that there's not necessarily
reason to disbelieve it but they were
pointing to a Tegra x1 i'll make some
assumptions based on that in a moment it
could still be Pascal but it does seem
unlikely at this time because I'm videos
not said anything other than there one
very ambiguous phrase the language left
left a lot of room for interpretation
but their phrasing on the website said
something like Nvidia's highest end GPU
architecture and all of the current
GeForce gaming graphics cards something
like that which I interpreted to mean
Pascal when this was posted but I
suppose if you're loose with the
interpretation you could say the 980ti
is still a leading GeForce graphics card
so maybe they meant Mac
well genzou regardless isn't a great SOC
peg right uses unified memory that
there's no reason that would change with
a switch the GP on the cpu share the
same memory pool they have direct access
to the memory bus and that is possible
through the GP you can explicitly
interact with the memory bus they all
share the same everything it's not like
if you're trying to do a unified memory
with a discrete GPU through the Intel
memory bus where you'd have to transact
actually instead through PCIe that's not
going to be a problem here assuming the
Tegra x1 so big assumptions here
assuming the x1 we know that it's
customized that probably means lower TDP
and that definitely means clock rate
tuning whether there's anything else in
there like core account tuning there's
no there's no information right now it's
either going to be 20 nanometer or 16
nanometer tsmc process xx is what the x1
uses TDP on x1 originally is 15 watts
but Kali will be customized on the
switch because the switch claims 2 to 6
hours of battery life depending on what
you're doing with best of the wild being
rated at around 3 hours and I'm not
really sure that's great or not yet
we'll have to see the x1 also uses
lpddr4 so it's low power consumption
ddr4 memory on a 64-bit memory bus Tegra
x1 it uses 4 arm course they are cortex
a 57 cores and those are attached to the
Maxwell GPU on the x1 which is a 256
core GPU again this is based on the
stock x1 so Nintendo could have changed
things within videos cooperation RNA 57
DistroWatch is where it does have a 2
megabyte l2 cache adaptive scalable
texture compression is also natively
supported by the SOC here the x1 and
then according to digital foundry the
GPU will be 768 mega Hertz when docked
this has been out for a little while now
from there leaks and that is a reduction
from 1 gigahertz on the x1 proper the
one that's used in Nvidia shield device
the portable clock rate is looking like
according to digital foundry something
like
Tigers take that with a grain of salt
there's that could have changed if their
documents that they've acquired are
accurate it doesn't mean that they were
final so that could change but the idea
is you lose a little over half the clock
rate when you are mobile how do you do
this then well the big question is
developers will have to code with that
in mind so if they want to program to
leverage the entire clock rate when
you're docked that could cause problems
when your portable the way to compensate
for that would generally be a lot of LOD
scaling kind of murdering the graphics
output in favor of of performance on a
lower clock rate that's a lot of work so
we'll see if the developers I actually
do program for both clock rates or if
they end up posting because they could
do this they could push their games to
run at the lower clock rate even when
it's docked and you just get worse
graphics as a result but it would work
in all circumstances and that seems at
least likely for indie developers or
smaller developers where they don't have
the manpower to do everything the GPU
assuming these clock rates will be well
under 1 teraflop of compute power well
under it the base Tiger x1 for reference
1 gigahertz with FP 16 is about a
teraflop of compute power of arithmetic
throughput the FP 32 throughput is 1/2
I'd be 512 gigaflops so making an
assumption here to calculate this you
take clock rate times and we'll put this
on the screen clock rate in gigahertz
times two for FP 16 times 2 FM a and
then times core count and that would
give you the through the compute power
so with these clock rates I'd be
something like 786 gigaflops @p 16 or
around 400 FP 32 when docked and there
might be some other considerations there
depending on what Nvidia has done to
tweak it but that's that's certainly not
the most powerful console on the market
and it's I guess for some perspective
it's well under any modern 100 dollar
GPU now of course when you're developing
vertov's holds a lot of different
there's this NBN API
which is a Nintendo the one Nintendo is
using with NVIDIA hence NBN and that
might be able to leverage well it should
really be able to leverage lower-level
Hardware access which would mean
utilizing that power to a more full
capacity whereas pcs generally don't so
that is something to keep in mind
battery life again two to six hours
Delta lasts about three hours on one
charge you can power it via USB type-c
including battery banks most likely that
is certainly relevant and I think we got
all of this other than the game so
launch titles include well relevant
launch titles include Zelda breath of
the wild one to switch super Bomberman
are for some reason Bomberman has
returned and then March you can expect
fast our MX sniffer clips whatever that
is has been heroes and heading into
April there's Mario Kart 8 deluxe and
everything else comes after that with a
few titles that are not specified like
minecraft so the sonic games we don't
know if Skyrim is the HD version or not
but that's what we're looking at right
now for the switch we will have
minimally a hardware teardown might look
into a console review with the games
that we've pre-ordered not promised but
that might happen if it does certainly
stay tuned and just maybe hold off on
your purchases for at least one of those
content pieces because that will
probably help you make decisions we'll
be on the lookout for lag and things
like that make sure they deliver in the
frame rates that are promised so check
