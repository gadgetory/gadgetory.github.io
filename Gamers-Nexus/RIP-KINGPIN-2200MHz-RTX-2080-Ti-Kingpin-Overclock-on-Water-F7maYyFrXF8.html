ripped a deer Bauer who still hasn't
gotten off of his lazy German asked to
respond and now we're back to rip
kingpin and for that process I am using
a new secret project video card you guys
here I'll just sample its last video
we're doing here at EB G's headquarters
are in the OC lab with Vince aka kingpin
it's going to be the namesake car the
kingpin card we saw this at CES you have
one here with the shroud removed so this
is this is not obviously the exact stock
configuration but what has changed here
since CES before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte ARS ad 27
QD gaming monitor the ad 27 QT is a
27-inch 1440p gaming display with 95% of
dcpip three color saturation for high
color accuracy accompanied by a one
millisecond response time 10 bit IPS
panel and display HDR visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs from
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles and
adaptive a noise reduction
learn more at the link below well it's
pretty much the same card not much
different the CES card was using a 120
yeah I'm your read we changed that to
240 that production card will come with
the 240
that's better cooling and also the Bo
LED on the CES card it was a permanent
part of the cover but we wanted to be
able to be modular so when you use Ellen
2 you can use this now the reason why is
because Tim put a special measurement on
there so we can check the grease ok
frozen you can see the delta know oh and
so when you lose the grease you will see
the delta giant you can warn the card up
you see the delta clothes ready to go
you can see it all real time on the
display temperature reading is like 2
minus 64 so you still like even if you
were running like first pre-cooling you
will see like how the temperatures
change and you will keep people
also so premonitory so if those readings
within like five things see then you
know you have a good grease content
that's cool
so right now you have it set you were
running Port Royal and should let's
let's start with I guess before we go
into more detail let's start with the
clocks you up set up just because that's
probably the biggest point of interest
here yeah this is this is a pretty good
card the I think I think most users who
get this card will be pretty happy with
the majority of the cards third they
will be hand picked and this this card
is no exception as you can see I have it
set to twenty to twenty and it's very
high yeah it's very high in 8475
and idling it's getting twenty nine C
and this is this is the card on the
bench right now right yeah we're looking
up there yeah this is not under any
crazy cooling no this is this is pretty
much anybody can do this you buy the car
you know I got a lot of when I post the
L&amp;amp;T result I posted an SLI result for
this card a few weeks ago not just a
quick one and I got some feedback like
hey we want to see what it does with the
shipping cooler yeah you came about
Ellen too well okay when I knew you were
coming today I thought what better way
to show gamers and my users what the
card can actually do so here you go and
in terms of typically to get any kind of
frequency like this on our txseries you
have to put a lot of power to the card
definitely so is there I'm a bio side of
things are you running a BIOS that I can
get stock like is this a special we will
we always take care of our customers
every every generation and this
generation won't be any different this
is not the shipping BIOS hmm but this is
a BIOS that I'll KP it access to far
well also like one of the reasons why we
had opted for three power connectors is
that you eval to raise your prospect
limit so actually the shipping cards
will be already with higher power limit
then you also can increase
using the precision to one forty four
percent so on let me ask that on the pre
connectors how
how necessary is this purchase to and
what's yours well it tells you to
essentially remove the power limit so if
you even running like water cooling OC
like you will never need to worry about
the party right so unlike the two power
connectors you will be limited by the
power and then by the temperature so
here you just worry about the
temperature and then card will go as
high as as high as the temperature
allows yeah what on these cards what
kind of cold scale do you normally see I
mean like is there a point where it
stops scaling to be honest not all cards
are the same okay some cards can run
full pot full temperature and make a
nice clock some cards require around one
there I saw 135 to 140 five is sort of a
sweet spot okay before you start to run
into issues either with the grease or
with the GPU itself so is it it's
typically is it a like a silicon
variance thing I guess like what they do
in GPUs you like assembly even more
power the Cramton the chip so it's very
important to have the contact and grease
right so like sometimes you need to have
a couple sessions to get the best ago
okay so with I guess I while we're
standing here can look at memory clocks
to 1475 offset I think I tested I tested
a few of the the early production cards
and there they all o'clock to around
this clock every single one of them some
memory I think for perspective for
viewers I think we were the max we were
doing was about twelve twenty twelve
forty on that some of our 28 et eyes
yeah so that's quite a bit higher yeah
and that's was that what's the my it's
not Samsung right I think it was my
Chronicle yeah Mike on that that that
typically I don't know I see with the
Samsung memory the reason why I chose it
for this card is because it's more
consistent okay you don't see like some
cards stuck low some cards going high
right let's luck of the draw
more this kind of performance most cards
do 1425 to 1500 so do you when you were
in our stream chat right you were
posting comments about a
Delta quacks you commented about setting
the 3dmark settings in Nvidia control
panel as well what can we go through
what our Delta clocks like what and
memory straps what's your kind of
top-level explanation I guess mm-hmm in
what way what do you mean well so you
were talking on the stream about how I
guess the best example was I think at
the time I was looking at maybe like an
8 40 megahertz offset versus like an 800
megahertz offside what's that memory
we're talking yeah memory memory and
sometimes we would see better
performance by stepping it down right
like stepping stepping the offset down
would yield higher performance in scores
then stepping it up a bit I don't know
if that's because you're like missing a
missing like a memories well like it's
really like a - two questions one
question is regarding the GPU frequency
because in the software you can say up
with the grain you know if you like one
megahertz I mean like plus one I guess
was two minutes but actually a real
hardware will set in steps like 15
minutes right so like not you will see
like even if you increase faster makers
nothing will happen with the phones will
do the same because the clock actually
did you PU is running is the same so it
will go in those steps but for the
memory like if you push too hard for the
offset then actually there will be
errors from the memory interface
operation and when GPU detects an error
it will like physically resent the data
okay so you will lose the bandwidth even
your frequency is five so they are they
effectively memory errors like is it
yeah yeah so there so if there is not
like like artifacts were crashes but
like if you push harder you will get to
the stuff that you can't see visually I
guess you just see it in the performance
yes yes of course you will see that
performance drop and then after that if
you push more you will see there are two
nodes right right on this particular
card I saw like when I when I select
1450 the score is almost always low but
as soon as I select 1475 it's even
almost nails it every time okay so like
yeah certain frequencies will score
better and certain frequencies just
won't score the internal clocks won't
what is that is that the same on on
pretty much every GPU
a particular model or does it change
like card key card usually it's kind of
similar look at the level you can see is
different because like there are a lot
of like the power design all that is
effective as well but like in general
you can see like the rule is applied for
the same generation okay
and the score you're getting here you've
been at ten thousand something right
yeah we've been ripping ten Kay's all
morning it's it's been looping I mean 10
K 10 K Port Royale 2200 GPU 1475 memory
that's that's that's pretty nuts if you
go home and bench your tight necks yeah
at the same clocks I think you will be
suave
that was a good score typically working
with these cards you keep kind of like a
keep out zone around the GPU for Allen's
he pops them out definite more easily
same with the OL that right it had to be
in a particularly space on the card so
the on2 pot would fit we do that with
everything all the components around the
GPU right it's the reason why you see
like the v rmp things on there both
sides separated so they actually make
any different pieces and so you can even
like if you install aftermarket water
could even set up like maybe you are on
chiller then you would want to keep the
original there and heatsink so you're
doing this nice and cool and also you
have the custom key to you that makes a
lot of sense yeah so the cooler itself
is an ASA tech Gen 6
you have the control over the fans on
the radiator and also control over the
fan on the erm anything so the
additional panel will help to push the
air through so like memory and we RM
will stay cool and you don't have that
thermal just 10,000 6100 yeah now you
know with the GPU boost
I'll start the benchmark at 22 20 and
you know this thing's hitting about 45
40 60 max under load at this speed so
that you know it drops a little bit
it'll write up like one Delta yeah the
turbo boost is still into place over
five see you c31 see it is kidnap absent
is is that the steps about 5 degrees
Celsius sir well
- I got a range is not the same so it's
not all the way up to 83 but you will
see that okay yeah I think we we
typically see changes like the most the
third around from 45 yeah yeah and just
going from like low 80s down like 70s or
if it gets like 68 or something
different I'm talking about like a stock
card right they good hot yeah yeah when
we saw that I was like you know this
this card has to have water cooling yeah
it helps a lot as do yes yeah we got
there all the usual camping stuff like
moon appears generation you have LEDs to
monitor the power and Robert so you can
measure the song DMM right measure the
GPU voltage memory voltage FX voltage
and also iPhone anything input so make
sure everything's okay and also will
have the option for the interface so you
can use a keyboard controller right
similar things is this is this stuff
hooked up to anything right now
I mean or wow this is what I'm doing
some testing and currently it's not
three is this for a this is what we'll
use for benching like two to measure the
voltage stability
okay and ddmm we used to or money for so
Vince what sort of voltage do you
normally run out on this for the GPU
right now I have the over voltage to
about 1.15
okay I noticed it scaled a little bit
because the temperatures are going on
right on Ellen - I run upwards of 1.5
close okay pretty high yeah
stock is a stock max or something like
one point zero nine three or something
like that right but it really depends on
the GPU they're all a little bit
different okay they're not the same for
a seam memory voltage here one point I
usually we have like the extra
integrated in the car so like usual card
you have the DMM you
some sort of connector to it to the card
so you can see what's the real voltage
is because the software doesn't actually
read over the one point one volts so we
integrated essentially the DMM function
into the card so you can see on the OLED
you can see all the voltages on the
frequencies or the temperatures and you
can actually configure through the
software what items you want to see okay
how much time any idea on availability
or pricing I know it's been a while now
but we're thinking thinking hopefully
sometime in March okay
pricing TBD I guess yeah but is it going
to be a hydropathy okay and I'll be a
hybrid the hydro copper will be limited
edition right kind of like a specialist
q okay it's special especially but I
think March I think March on the hybrid
and maybe a little bit later after that
cool last question I have for you is can
we take one apart or is it not ready yet
okay so yeah okay so maybe maybe
separate video we'll see yeah sure okay
cool well thank you for the walkthrough
I guess look out for it in March
sometime probably yeah cool and check
back for all the other content we've
done here subscribe for more as always
you can go to patreon.com/scishow sexist
i directly and thank you to Vince and
ten for joining me we'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
