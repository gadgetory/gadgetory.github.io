hand for the RX 480 we previously just
recently talked about the release of the
card being on jun 29th the announcement
was this week at computex 2016 they're
being pretty cautious about their market
positioning for polaris ten which we're
going to talk about here before that all
this coverage is brought to you by
roseville and a new Cullinan case with
tempered glass side panels so the RX 480
that is the first as far as rumors have
indicated plus official announcements
the first Polaris 10 GPU to be announced
it will be more than five teraflops in
compute performance the reference card
is still going with the blower fan but
it's got a small PCB as you can observe
in our photos of the card and of am
diese live unveil of the card so they're
sticking with a sort of semi smaller
form factor it's priced at two hundred
dollars which means that it will be
replacing the 380 x which operated at
about 3.97 teraflops compute depending
on which 380 x you got so it will be
replacing the 380 x the 4 gigabyte
capacity for 80 that's two hundred
dollars to eight gigabyte one we're not
sure yet but probably and this is my
speculation here not official probably
in the two fifty dollar range AMD
doesn't have a lot of room to go higher
than that because they threatened by the
1070 once you start entering that
mid-range high range market and they
really can't go lower than it just
because of cost so this is where things
get interesting and where AMD kind of is
in a tight spot and one thing here
Polaris 10 and Polaris 11 neither is
meant for the high-end they're not meant
to compete with the GTX 1080 they're not
really meant to compete with the GTX
1070 though the 480 will certainly try
to take market share away from the 1070
at a lower cost at perhaps a slightly
lower performance and it should be lower
performance because the compute is much
different though both companies drive a
different amount of actual performance
out of their compute and the shader
array and everything like that so these
Polaris devices are not meant to fight
at the high end AMD is not going for a
halo entry here they're going for a
consumer entry they're targeting the
80-plus percent of consumers who buy one
hundreds of $300 video cards and that I
think is a good move for them because
the 1080 is good and even if Andy could
compete with it directly today it seems
given their market position a good idea
to allow the 1080 some room to breathe
and compete where there's no competition
right now and that would be the 100 to
300 dollar market because after that
point and videos got brand new releases
so then the 1060 becomes a concern but
we'll come back to that in a moment as
far as the RX 480 its positioning as a 4
gigabyte card at two hundred dollars
seems okay two hundred fifty dollars at
eight gigabytes seems okay once you get
beyond that point it's too close to the
1070 I think and people start looking at
it as I can spend fifty sixty seventy
dollars more and get a pretty good 1070
and that's really not a ton of money at
that point depending on who you ask so
why is that relevant if they're going to
ship in the 250 out of range well
there's not a lot of room above the
reference design for high-end aib cards
so I would not expect a lot of serious
overclocking potential or at least even
if there's it may be there is
overclocking potential let's say there
is I would not expect a lot of serious
overclocking targeted cards from a I be
partners that have greater phase setups
better power design that have more
advanced PWM or whatever the case may be
so there's not a lot of room there to
grow after that point because of the
threat so once you get below the two
hundred dollar price range it opens up
even more for AMD because the current
competition from Nvidia at the very
lowest end would be the 750 Ti that's
pretty dated now that was Maxwell
version one that was before Maxwell
version 2 it certainly isn't Pascal so
that card is kind of edging off our
charts as we test these new games it's
no longer hitting the performance
metrics desired even at lower graphics
settings so that I would say it's
falling off the charts there's room
there for AMD to enter the market after
this heaven for the TI there's the 950
which when we reviewed it said was a
very weird price in position but now it
makes sense because the 750 ti is being
phased out in the 950 has sort of taken
its place from
DVR 73 70 and the r9 380 non x will be
edged out by the 480 both of them and
probably if there is one the RX 470 but
we don't have any official confirmation
on something like that just yet other
than the rumors we've seen around the
web so that's the market stack up that's
the position right now in terms of
performance just to give you an idea and
these are not linearly comparable but I
want to throw out some numbers here the
gtx 960 4 gigabyte card is priced at
about 180 dollars it has about two and a
half to three teraflops of compute
performance that puts it a good deal
below the 480 and raw compute but that's
not counting architectural things
algorithms things like that but raw
compute is a good metric to at least
base our initial assumptions on since we
don't have a real r x 480 so the 960 i
think we'll sort of get edged out a bit
by the 480 and the 380 x certainly will
be replaced by it then there's the 979
70 performs more comparable to the
higher range cards it will be of course
replaced by the 1070 but the reason I
mention it is because of all the used
models that will be hitting the market
and because of all the sales on the new
models that are being dumped very
briefly by the retailers before the
usual video card price spike at eol
because they're trying to get those
people who thought they were going to
buy two cars or sli or whatever at the
end of life and gouge the extra couple
bucks that the retailer's can at the end
of that so overall MD is being cautious
with its hand it is not playing to the
high end halo market right now they
don't want that small percentage of
users they do but not not for the fight
that would be required put up against
nvidia at this time going for the
mid-range at the mid-range nvidia will
have the 1060 but it's not here yet so
here's the thing to look out for AMD
announced the release date as jun 29th i
don't know if that's a yield thing i
don't know if it's a manufacturing thing
if this was a business decision it seems
an odd one and that's because at that
point the 1070 will have
saturated the part of the market that it
is targeting for the immediate adopters
of course there's a huge amount of
market left this is obviously very small
portion but they do lose that bit of the
halo effect for the immediate launch of
the 1070 in the 480 at the lower end we
look at things like the 1060 I don't
know when that's coming out but
certainly the 29th is going to be
getting a little bit closer than I think
AMD might have intended to be originally
with Nvidia's mid-range performer in
terms of the long-term prospects Vega
will be shipping with hbm to in theory
at some point I don't know that HB m2 is
really what AM d needs to get the edge
that they did that they want with these
high-end cards like the 490 or whatever
it may be maybe it's the 480 X I don't
know the name of it none of us really do
but they need more than hbm to they need
a higher compute they certainly AMD has
a good handle on a sink right now with
the physical Hardware on the die and
videos taken the algorithm approach to
async compute so they're in a good
position there dx11 still huge md is
dx11 performance is so low that the
gains to DX 12 although large are still
putting them in some ways below or at
parity with nvidia so is it's it's a
very big fight for them to take the 480
is a good place to start in the 200 250
dollar markets I think after that point
and they will need to look into the even
lower market so that'd be a hundred to
two hundred dollars so that they can try
and edged out the remaining and video
low-end chips before the Pascal chips
come so a very sort of haphazard quick
chaotically organized thoughts on the
new AMD launch and the competition
against Pascal this is obviously we're
still in Taipei here we haven't had a
good chance to really dig in deep with
the technical details but we'll be doing
that as launch approaches so do stay
tuned for more information on that so as
always thanks for watching a patriotic
virtual video if you have thoughts on
this because none of us really have a
super hard data just yet leave a comment
below start a discussion hopefully a
civil one and talk about what your
thoughts are
and Andy's market strategy here thanks
ROG and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
