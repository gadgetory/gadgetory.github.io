founder and principal consultant have
next-gen interactions we focus on
emerging technologies such as virtual
reality and that's what I'll be talking
today applied towards gaming
entertainment in general but also a
little bit about how some of these
technologies applied towards serious
gaming as well before I get started I'm
curious how many of you have tried to
oculus rift Wow almost everyone alright
and how many of you actually are how one
that you own yourself a few of you okay
well the new ones coming out of the
summers of maybe Gaza waiting for that
that's going to be going to be even a
better version the Deaf tip number two
and then next maybe in a year or so the
actual consumer version will be coming
out the Deaf get one that we certainly
have is pretty cool but it's not quite
there yet we're still or oculus i should
say it's still developing that
constantly improving upon down to add
new features and such as very basic at
this point but you can kind of get an
idea when you use the populace rift that
what's coming to the consumer virtual
reality margin curious out of those that
have the ribs are any of you actually
developing your content creation or
anything with it a couple people okay
great so you're probably well aware of
some of these things i'll try to you
explain some concepts that i picked a
report for development and for those of
you kind of considering that we can give
you some ideas when you do start
creating and what to do with
okay so I'll just start off with what is
virtual reality well I kind of define
virtual reality as replacing the real
world with computer-generated cubes
those q's might be visual cues of course
of the primary thing but as you all know
with games things like audio is very
important as well what we have with
virtual reality is that also that sense
of touch that sense of proprioception
that I can feel how my head moves
instead of just keeping my head still
and only having visual and audio
auditory cues also in some cases will
trip through full-body tracking for the
ideal virtual reality experience as a
simpler version of that might just be
trapped in the hand so that you can
interact the work now virtual reality is
something that's very difficult to
explain in words it's something you have
to experience to really get what it's
about knows idea to try to be probably
understand that that's hard for me to
explain so also a short video that first
I want to show an example reaction of
some a tremor to reality for the first
time and some of you may have seen this
video this is a 90 year old grandma
trying to virtual reality with the
oculus rift for the first time and so
specifically of course you'll see her
reaction that's pay attentions careful
attention to her words of what she says
how she describes the experience
something where I want the different
alright that's a short version of that
she goes on to say other amazing things
as well that me to that video has gotten
over 2 million views on YouTube so the
massive number of consumers are starting
to understand what virtual reality is
and starting to imagine what can
actually be capable now the specific
word she used one phrase was my friends
aren't going to believe this when I tell
them right again something you can
describe but you have to experience now
if this 90 year old grandma goes to one
of her you good friends or a relative
and says yeah I was in my living room
and I was transported to this other
place that didn't really exist if they'd
never heard of virtuality what you think
they're going to think during the
fictions you know kind of losing it that
they're not going to take her seriously
I'm in one place but I'm actually in
another complete other universe I just
sounds crazy and so something you have
to actually see to actually experience
them she also asked the question am I
still where I was that implies she
actually felt that she was present in
that other world that's what we really
something we're trying to strive for her
in virtual reality is a sense of
presence the sense of being somewhere
else other than where you're physically
located she pays happy she was implying
that she wasn't sure how in my in my
living room or in am I in this alternate
border and so that's pretty pretty
compelling pretty convincing when you
actually feel like you're somewhere else
sure where you're located yeah this was
a very simple demo this is just the
oculus rift by itself there's no 7 no
body tracking she's not really
interacting with the world it's more of
a passive experience and she still had
that very surreal experience per person
okay up next I want to actually show you
an example of a virtual reality
experience I work with the virtuix the
company virtuix with their bought me
directional treadmill of creating a game
or their system and that was showing on
Shark Tank ABC shark tank back in
December of this year have you guys seen
that you guys all seem shark tank people
or at least know what it is essentially
it's a panel of investors that come on
board and people come up companies come
up and pitch their product trying to get
an estimate the virtuix Omni is an
omnidirectional treadmill so imagine
that you're in the gym and you're
exercising like you normally do in some
cases they actually have a game in front
of you that the faster you run you can
collect points you can compete with
other players and such as sort of a
traditional Russian said traditional
over the last ten years or so help me
set been developing these interactive
feeling like treadmill machines for
exercise this is a little bit different
because it's an omnidirectional
treadmill so you can physically turn
around 180 degrees a huge so imagine
that you know you're fighting the bad
guys and he pulls out they pull out the
big guns you first thing you might do
just instinctively might even not not
even think about it just turn around you
know run as fast as you can you can
actually do that with this treadmill
it's pretty cool so with that I'll show
a short clip of that show because gone
the CEO of virtue X he really explains
virtual reality well I think maybe
perhaps better than I can scream so
you'll show it and also explain it as
well as showing what this work
to walk
degrees which are mine
okay so that kind of gives you an idea
of what it's like although not that
obviously tried yourself to get a bowl
experience the shark the Sharks love
what they had but yon was asking for far
too much money than what they're
normally used to investing in it was
actually he was founded the company at
20 million dollars and was asking for
two million dollars which was more than
anyone had ever asked for in the history
of shark and so they gave him a really
hard time did not invest in virtue aches
and Janka to Madonna cars I just read
this morning that Mark Cuban one of the
Sharks was one of the investors that put
three million dollars into the company
so they're finally starting to believe
that this is actually taking off and
it's becoming real where is it you know
in just a few months ago they didn't
believe this would actually take off it
may have something to do with the
Facebook acquisition of oculus for two
billion dollars i suspect that you've
got very interested in that so some of I
know some people have been kind of upset
thinking about Facebook what do they
have to do with virtual reality well
it's now nothing other than they bought
oculus it's actually I believe very
strongly it's a very good thing even if
it is facebook the reason for that is
because it gets credibility to what we
do with virtual reality and now other
investors are going to be able to come
in and provide funding so that we're
able to really make these experiences
the best we can be we can only do so
much kind of in our spare time if we can
actually you know get funding to you
know build studios and such but you all
have the capability to do it will be
much easier to do that because facebook
is basically validated parking as well
as others such as Sony recently
announced a head-mounted display that
will be coming on the markets and plenty
of other companies as well lots a
head-mounted displays are coming out on
the market
a little bit of history here is what I
call old school virtual reality this is
a project that we work with general
motors on about 15 years ago in
something called it a Kate a cave is a
very different type of display than a
head-mounted display a cave is actually
a physical room you could actually see
the edges of the walls these are walls
this is the front wall this is the
stocking and this is the floor of the
room you actually sit and the
stereoscopic images are projected onto
those walls you have head tracking so
the system knows where you're looking
and how you move your head and such it's
a very compelling experience you
actually feel like you're you're in that
automobile here instead of in a room
with images on the walls the walls
actually start to disappear because
you're seeing that in each I had seen a
different image and so we have the sense
of depth kind of like a 3d television
except you're completely surrounded by
now and I show this because this is an
example of where virtual reality has
been but it wasn't available in the
living room right he couldn't put this
display your living room the rather
head-mounted displays they were
sometimes a hundred thousand dollars at
work so I wasn't going to be in your
living room unless you were someone like
Mark Cuban maybe he had in his liver but
most of us didn't have access to it now
we can have access to that it doesn't
cost these systems started at somewhere
around 500 million five hundred thousand
dollars I 590 I'd be a bit expensive but
in other cases they completely have
designed the buildings to go around
these caves very expensive but not all
of us have access to so this is a very
exciting time for us is that they're
indie developers insights because anyone
is now able to develop these virtual
reality experiences
now head-mounted displays that's exactly
what an oculus rift is is this display
put on your face is trapped and look
around so you're completely surrounded
by the virtual world that's not a new
thing oculus they've done it very well I
they're doing amazing things I was a
little skeptical when they first came
out because I knew how hard of a problem
it was but they've proven over and over
again that they're doing things right
right and creating a very compelling
hardware as well as a software and so
I'm very happy that what they've done
with virtual reality to bring it to the
masses head-mounted displays actually
have been around for quite a while I
just saw Steve Alice of NASA Ames
Research Center he had the slide at the
I Triple E virtual reality conference a
couple weeks ago and he claimed is its
kind of commonly quoted that Ivan
Sutherland at the university of utah
back in the 60s created the first
head-mounted display that's what 40 or
50 years ago but it actually goes back
further than them according to Steve
Alice he traced it back and he also
claims that it goes back all the way
back to Galileo he created the first
head-mounted display in order to
determine his location when you know her
navigating ships and such and so this
has been around why the woman and is
continuing to bball oculus has just
taken it to the next level brought into
the masses and done it very well and
also the technology is starting to catch
up so it's at an affordable price now so
we can all have access to it
so these virtual realities have been
around a while however we haven't all
have access to it to a massive number of
developers it's often consisted of
programmer art or scientific
visualization that doesn't have that
aesthetic appeal that we have advised
people in this room how has gained about
this really is a new artistic medium
that artists now are able to create
experiences to be able to create this
compelling content that just blows us
away that we just didn't have access to
you know 10 15 years ago because and you
know nothing against programmers on the
program or myself but you don't want to
see my heart right it's a pretty I might
have you know the bad guys might be you
know consist of cubes that's my arm
right and so we need artists we need
designers we need psychologists is a
very much multidisciplinary field that
now that this is accessible to everyone
we're able to access all those different
fields all those different types of
individuals that mean and why I say it's
new is because this is completely
different than traditional video games
the screen completely disappears so you
start you stock perceiving this display
that's fixed in space out right at you
with a wide field of view you kind of
lose yourself and you don't even pay
attention anymore to the edges of the
screen once you get really engaged in
the game you can you know because I
mentioned earlier you can completely
turn around and so that you're just in
the world instead of looking into a
window into the virtual work you're
completely immersed and because of that
a lot of concepts and traditional video
game design no longer apply we have to
rethink that entire process and so the
best virtual reality games will be
designed from the beginning or virtual
real and so some companies have parted
some of their existing games to the
oculus rift for example which is good
that's important because we got
art somewhere but to really make those
games compelling we have to start from
them and part of the reason for that is
something called simulator sickness that
I'll be talking a little bit later
similar to car sickness or going on a
carnival ride some people are just going
to get sick because it's a very intense
experience and there's some
physiological things going on in the
human body that we can't solve
technically and so we have to be very
careful how we designed the games and
keep those you know thoughts in our
minds i know some games that have been
ported to the oculus rift you know the
character in the regular game it's okay
if your character runs at 20 miles an
hour but virtual reality if you run a 20
miles an hour something's not going to
be writing or 2d text on a display
screen now needs to be true 3d you can't
have like occlusion issues of the text
going through walls and such and so
those are things we need anything now
today oculus is doing a very good job of
selling the technology as well as some
of the other companies however one of
the reasons why oculus is so successful
is because they're selling the story
there's something to excitement they're
selling the motion of what virtual
reality can bring us and now it's one of
the reasons why they're doing so well
other companies of you know how ill
head-mounted displays an attempted to
something I Charlie believe that's one
of the reasons why I oculus is so
successful that's sort of how they start
they had to have 20 years of experience
building these virtual reality
experiences however because they were
able to build out excitement they were
of liquor you know hire some of the best
game developers there aren't they got
they got John Carter math they have
Michael average some of these just by
you know these gods in the computer game
development community they've been able
to attract them because they built that
excitement
and so as we continue into the future we
need to be you know very careful that me
as a technical programmer I sometimes
forget about that and so we just all
need to remember that it's the
experience or selling not the
technologist reasonable that would
become more and work more and more
important is different mountain Studios
come in and compete in the space ok now
I'm going to get into some details of
some example work I've done ends of
concepts that you could apply in your
development for virtual reality I
mentioned earlier that we kind of need
to think from the beginning how the
interface is different than it is in a
traditional game and a traditional game
you're not trapped in your hand so it
makes sense to put up information on the
display just take it down in the corner
of the screen you're how far or whatever
it might be the problem without it in a
wide field of view head-mounted display
can put it down in the corner of the
screen it's like way down here it's on
the edge of my vision where I don't have
high visual acuity and so that may not
be the right space so maybe it needs to
be actually and physical space are
attached to your body in some ways so
when you want to see something you know
kind of look down to the side the
similar that maybe you know you look at
a watch on your hand and so what I did
here the original six cents
entertainment with the razor hydros the
razor hydros are these handheld traffic
controllers that trap the orientation
and position of the hands and so you can
kind of you know move around and see
your virtual hands look around they
simply out there on the mapping of the
buttons the instructions of what the
controller does up in front which was
useful but then it kind of got in the
way it was a little bit distracting what
happens you know if I don't want that
they're figure out how to turn off so
what I did here was just extremely
simple I mean this literally look took
10 minutes to do so there's nothing
complicated about these things but you
know sometimes in
almost all the time and design if you
could take something complicated and
simplify it to its simplest forms that's
where the real power comes where anyone
is able to use that making something
complicated very simple so all I did was
I took those mappings that normally came
up in front of your screen split the
image in half so I had an image of the
mappings for the left hand right hand
and then I attach them to the hand and
now wherever I move the hands my hands
here so it makes sense okay if I want to
see what the mapping does for this
button where my thumb approximately is
then I just you know label where that
thumb approximately is so I look at my
hand and now I know what that done
button does and so that way you can be
able to just you know look down where
the interface is instead of this an
indirect now yeah this is something very
simple and I'm sure it will evolve you
know maybe some more complicated
interfaces for example you could you
know when you push about you could
highlight the buccaneer and sort of
thing so these simple concepts of design
will be important as we move forward not
necessarily complicated just we need to
get creative and think outside of the
traditional user interfaces you're
getting to them Oh another thing I
forgot to mention here that's very
important is you can see the user sees
some sort of body well it's not like
that body's on its screen out in front
of the user remember the screen kind of
disappeared to your aversive you're
surrounded by the game well my lower
body my legs is part of that immersion
I'm look down and I see my own feet in
approximate location where my me know it
turns out that's extremely compelling
especially for something called presence
that oculus and others often talk about
that sense of being there well if you
just have this viewpoint this camera
floating through space not attached to a
body it's very weird to look down not
see anything it's like you're just kind
of floating in space somewhere so if you
just have even a rough approximation of
the body is that's extremely compelling
and then if you have the trap can such
as in this case when you see this even
those hands help me to be photorealistic
it they don't need to be the same color
of your skin you don't have to have the
same color jeans on to be able to see
your body move around as if it's that
same location of your body it's a
complete different experience and that
causes people need to get that sense of
presence that really feel like you're
taking on being that character being
that avatar ok we'll move on another to
even add more on to that is to have
these avatars if you're tracking the you
know even if you're simply tracking the
head the hands and crowds are tracking
where the heads looking such as you can
do with the oculus rift that can be
extremely compelling as well because now
you have this sort of natural
communication be is a very subtle body
language you don't have to think about
oh I want to push you know what was the
what was the button to surrender again
you don't have to think about that maybe
you just hold up your hands and so for
example here this is I'm going to call
the Paul he's the other character and
when I shoot the gun out he's like whoa
you know I surrender it just doesn't
automatically might not even be thinking
about them and for example head tracking
is another very subtle cues that you
don't even think about maybe in this
regular game that sense of eye contact
even though we're not trapped in the
eyes not yet anyway that where is the
head looking in the very compelling so
if they're looking in your direction you
know that looking in your direction it's
a very one-on-one different the video
conferencing one of the challenges with
video conferencing is and you know the
cameras over here in the screens here
you lose that sense of icon here we do
have that since I content because the
character is mapped in physical space
where it should be
okay I mentioned earlier a little bit
about simulator sickness that's one of
the real challenges of virtual reality
just like the carnival rides that I
mentioned some people it's not
appropriate and they know they can't go
in carnival rides and maybe if they do
it more and more they can become
accustomed to that and such but what we
can do is we can reduce that simulator
sickness as much as possible we can do
things smart we can be careful of the
technology be careful of that interface
all those things we need to be very
aware if you for example if you have a
low frame rate and a game is over the
traditional game is a little bit
annoying and virtual reality if you're
only rendering a 30 frames per second
it's not just annoying it can make you
physically sick the reason for that is
because the system thinks I'm looking
over here but a split second later I'm
looking over here but it's still
displaying what I was looking over there
your brain gets confused the reason why
I get confused is because we have the
sense of balance in our interview
cognitivist if your system it's that
sense of balance a sense of a
deceleration acceleration if those kind
of subtle cues a balance don't match
what my eyeballs are seeing then the
brain gets very confused and it says
wait a second something's wrong here
maybe I from an evolutionary point of
view maybe I you know it's a bad fairies
that were poisonous not I better you
know we check that out of my system and
you get sick that's one you know theory
of why that's the case but it's really
all it is is a century coupon plate that
you're different sense is being out of
sync with each other and now can cause
similar your sickness so we understand
the basics of simulator sickness but
this is very much an open open research
at this point of understanding and one
of the challenges of understanding
simulator sickness is the biggest after
in simulator sickness is to individual
some things that I do for example I can
you know virtually back up with my
in virtual reality and I feel fine or i
can straight to the left or right I feel
fine other people sometimes that makes
them sit and maybe they can do some
things that made me sit but don't make
medicine and so that's one of the real
challenges is they can very much be an
individual into some individuals
simulator sickness affects them in
different ways now there's a blue arrow
here that I want to talk about what is
that blue an area I it's part of the
interface but it's not so much part of
the interfaces this is a maybe a bold
claim but that blue era helps reduce
simulator sickness what's that that's
all it is is a blue arrow it's nothing
complicated right there's no complicated
algorithm here to understand that's just
a blue hair of and yelling in the world
what it is and I this was me playing
around I didn't know if it would work
but I kind of had the idea I realize
that some virtual reality experiences
are in a phase of driving game or you're
in some sort of wow that cockpit in
the game is a stable world reference q
no matter which way I look or no matter
how I move forward that cockpit is
always going to be in the same position
relative to my body right if I fly
forward the world outside the window
moves forward but the cockpit stays in
place that cockpit is actually
stabilizes a real world reference to you
no matter what I do it's always
physically in front of me it's the same
location as a physical keyboard and that
helps those are good games to develop
poor because people don't get nearly as
sick in those systems because it's just
like the real world like I was might be
sitting in the car and also the
periphery that wide field of view we
tend to have that sense
action more when something was in the
periphery versus our central part of our
bill with you affection is if any of you
have been sitting in a parking lot maybe
you're kind of looking down or something
then a bus or something moves in your
periphery and you kind of you feel that
sense what what what happened you
actually feel that sense of self motion
even though you didn't move that's an
illusion the same thing out some condoms
with a virtual reality something moves
in your periphery or the entire build of
you moves you get that same sense
affection which kind of makes you feel a
little funny in continue doing actually
do simulators so this blue arrow I
thought okay a first-person shooter is
not appropriate to have a cockpit
because it'd be weird that if this maybe
if your mech pod or something it might
make sense but just if you're walking
around you can't have a cockpit room so
I thought what if I could add some sort
of artificial real-world reference cues
that are stable in the physical space
with a helper you simulator settings and
for me it made much more a bigger impact
than I thought because I could if I
started feeling hydrated still in that
sense affection I could focus on that
arrow and realize okay let's kind of
ignore everything that's you know in the
world moving is i virtually walk forward
and focus on the arrow and think about
that as something that's visible in the
real world and for me it felt like wow
this feels a lot better and the few
people that I have tested out they felt
they kinda commented on that as well and
so this I haven't done you can form of
user studies or anything on this but
this is an example of what we can
experiment with and you know further
investigate we don't have all the
answers yet but this excitement times
because why open any of us can tragic
scenes now all we need is an oculus rift
Rose we needed is you know the Saudi hmp
coming out and all of us can start
experimenting a lot of those experiments
may go bad some of those things are
going to be pretty exciting as far as
yep what we can do and what helps create
these more about
virtual worlds okay another topic is
something called coordinate systems and
all of you that a developer you know
traditional video games you understand
and you have these different ordinances
dragging out the camera coordinate
system you have the world coordinate
system virtual reality it's no different
in this game i have i'm showing here
this you can see several different
things is a little confusing again
without training this is something you
have to actually experience experience
and so while it's a little difficult to
describe when you see it you kind of get
it immediately what are these different
visual cues that are just you know more
than the word and so again you see the
blue arrows you can see i added more
blue arrows and that was us saying is
that's what the former directions that
is what that physical representation is
so as I move around you have this sort
of real world reference to you to reduce
that simulator students add more of
those blue arrows now this is just kind
of a direction my physical torso is
facing so I know which ways forward oh
one thing I forgot to mention is some
people mentioned that you know for
example oculus they suggest that move
the player in the direction you're
looking so if i push the controller
forward by facing this way then move
this however if i turn my head this way
and move this way that's fine but when
you had an avatar where you're actually
seeing your own body that becomes very
weird because if i turn my head like
this what happens to your torso your
torso still facing this way but what
does the avatar move this way when you
only move your head it's sort of an
unknown in my case I said let's always
assume the torso is facing this way and
I can look down and see my body my torch
is still forward but I'm looking to the
left now I can walk in this direction
instead of looking in this
and then there's no it's a little bit
better as far as the representation of
the your own body when you look down
just like it's more like the real worth
so these blue arrows are not actually
looking down always looking down on your
mind so instead I put another reason i
put these blue areas so you always have
an idea of which direction here torso is
so now when i push the controller
forward i realize okay even though i'm
facing this way the blue arrows are in
this direction so my mind just gets
accustomed to saying to thinking okay
forward is in the direction of the
arrows not necessarily the direction on
the that gives you more control so you
can look all around as you're moving
throughout the word so that's one
example of a coordinate system which is
just about what i call the body centered
coordinate system which way is my choice
of basically of course we also have the
game coordinate system right now you all
know that from the games which way is
nori and if you look at the bottom of
this image what I did here was I
surrounded the user by a compass so if
they get lost it's very easy to get lost
in these virtual worlds because if you
virtually rotate you forget in the real
world it can be difficult enough to
remember which way starting but in
virtual world to become lost very easily
especially in our complicated matters in
this virtual world i have here I
completely I forget where things were
even though I created a map and so
having that compass allows me to better
be able to create that cognitive map of
okay what is this what is this world
like I'm trying to head in the northern
direction but if I rotate you know all
around personally I forget which way's
fine and so you can kind of just look
down and see the game world coordinate
system and remember oh I'm heading north
I just need always had to go in the
direction of this compass that I'm
looking down on surrounding
another coordinate system of course is
the hand coordinate system that we're
doing and tracking such as the image I
showed earlier that you might have a
user interface attached to that
coordinate system another coordinate
system i have in this example because
i'm not doing man tracking in this case
i'm tracking the head which way am i
looking well this is a head century
coordinate system this kind of
transparent target area so you know if
you want to target here the laser
shootout room as if you know your eyes
are shooting out a laser from your own
and to be able to you know target things
in the world that way so that's yet
another coordinate system that when
we're designing we have to think about
how these how all these coordinate
systems work together however when the
user gets in there they get it
immediately because it's like a real
world helmet on looking all around those
just this crosshair and Freddie similar
to you know wearing the football game
and so these coordinate systems headed
maybe are a little bit hard to think
about as we're developing but when the
user gets in there they just give it
automatically ok this is the compasses
the blue arrows on facing this way these
are my hands it sort of this very
natural sort of usernames okay being
that this is a serious games track I had
to put in this image here for a serious
game that we're working on we're working
with the National Institute of Health on
a educational game for kids this is
grades 3 through 5 actually putting the
kids into the game visit and so imagine
being able to physically crawl through a
body to explore different you know
different organs and such within the
body and so now it now it's no longer
just a game of these visual and auditory
use we have that kinesthetic you that
sense of your arms actually moving
around because we're using the sixth
sense razor hydros in order to track the
hand so you can kind of yell crawl
around physically with your hands and we
believe that I actually putting the kids
in the game now they're learning
physically the same way that they you
know play and this applied specifically
to neuroscience education which can be
kind of a very abstract thing especially
for kids but we believe if we you know
physically put them in something that
you know remember much better after all
we're competing with him all the great
games you guys are creating so we have
to really you know what is the next
thing that really you know get these
kids engaged in the games and the real
idea behind this is this applied towards
on as I mentioned neuroscience education
and so it's not just necessarily you
know remember what organ this is and
what is it is called I personally
interested in more higher level concepts
versus just memorizing different parts
of the body and so in this game we
should teach kind of self awareness of
our own box of our own actions so
imagine indecision it'd be useful for us
as adults as well imagine you know
teaching kids that you know when
something happens in the world so you
get bullied or you get teased or
something to that effect imagine kids
being able to step back and realize oh
you don't have an this audit and some
stimulus happened in the world and I'm
having this sort of automatic response
then realizing oh that's just the you
know by an egg divided us you know some
part of my brain reacting in a certain
way however then realizing oh what this
is happening again and then realizing
you know that is happening that's my
automatic response because now I'm aware
of it I can step back and say you know
maybe that response isn't the most isn't
appropriate in this situation maybe it
would be more empowering to be able to
choose something different to reactive
you know the call to bullion on what
he's doing or you know whatever that
might be given this specific situation
so being able to you know become help
them become more aware their own
thoughts of you know how their brains
working such okay that kind of sums up
what or this slide kind of sums up what
we talked about that there's lots of
things to think about in a design point
of view from a technical implementation
point of view you know creating that
compelling art and how to actually it's
very important to embed things in the
world and think about things as if they
were real world objects make it as real
as possible but then continue beyond
what we can do in reality you know
reality we don't have this you know
interface in the world that you can
reach out to touch things or you know
manipulate objects out of distances you
know like magic but first we have to
make it to be the real world so that it
behaves like room wearing otherwise
don't be challenges with a simulator
sicknesses now the I Triple E virtual
reality conference a couple weeks ago
one of my one of my mentors he gave the
keynote about virtual reality he was so
excited about the facebook acquisition
because I validated you know what he's
been doing for she's forever since the
early 80s working on virtual reality and
he saw that as this validates what we've
been doing for you know a very long time
and now people are taking this seriously
now there's going to be you know you
guys out there also contributing to what
we're doing and to be able to bring in
funding to be able to get people excited
to bring this to the deal worked where
the entire world will be able to
eventually experiences so he was super
excited and what was really inspiring is
what he said about few people whatever
their career is over
I'll tag if they're you know how the
desk job whatever it might be they're
doing sort of these iterative changes
because you know they're improving
things but it's a very slow pace because
it's very complicated these technologies
have been out in the market for a while
I with virtual reality is something
brand-new at least outside of the
research view of the field it's open to
anyone that we really do have the
opportunity to change the world to how
teach the serious game concepts for
example but just you know entertainment
purposes to have something that you know
will remember like the grandma
remembered that said you know what one
thing she said is I'm going to remember
this the rest of my life even though she
was 19 years old that people will
remember these experiences of offering
these compelling sort of engaging
stories maybe you know applying and how
that applies to their real life it's
just completely wide-open we have you
know a major opportunity here and Palmer
Luckey 20 years old Brent when you
started oculus two years ago he didn't
have 20 years of experience it didn't
have you know a bunch of advanced
degrees he was able to create that
because he was able to access the
technology that's available now at an
affordable price and if in two years he
can create what he's created what's
stopping us from doing you know creating
great things ourselves so if a 20 year
old kid can do it what god s is a
community all coming together we have
that opportunity and what what dr. Fuchs
said as well he said let's not blow it
right let's try to do this right let's
be passionate about what we're doing
let's create these world some of us have
been dreaming up
20 years okay with that I'd like to
mention some upcoming events that i'll
be participating in here about what is
that about two weeks ago to its away I'm
sorry we'll be on the narrow game
conference in san francisco and the idea
there is to take Nero's I ensconce of
such as you know since an EEG sensors in
such sensing to what the brain is
actually doing in Cork what can we do to
incorporate to integrate together
virtual reality technology ish with
neuroscience technologies that is a
completely wide-open builders some
people have been playing around with it
but something since wide open i saw i
talked to help weeks ago where it was a
virtual mirror virtual reality augmented
reality sort of experience you looked in
the mirror the player had the sensors on
its head he looked in the mirror saw a
virtual representation of himself and
the sensors read what you know what the
different parts of his brain raveena
activated you could look in the mirror
and as he could watch actually watch his
thoughts occur overlaid on his green in
a mirror right that's like one of it
again pretty simple but just one of the
coolest things like wow I never thought
of that you know any of us could've done
pretty cool stuff at that conference
will i also have a power lodging the
founder of oculus and richard marx the
developer of the PlayStation Move and
also one of the key players and Sony
head mounted display the Morpheus that
some was just recently announced they'll
be honest they'll be on the same man I
don't know if those guys have ever been
in the same room so we hope to get a
little controversial boy I'm gonna pass
it there let's see what happens the
silicon back belly virtual reality
conference if any of your out there are
in California are might even be more
traveling if you really want to get
serious about this i don't have a good
definitely going to be there we have
some great speakers as well we have yon
CEO of virtue it's that we showed the
homie director
Miller where again Richard Mars Tom
you're lucky you're going to be there as
well as some other pretty amazing
speakers that you know really the
visionaries in this deal and a little
bit after that is the Augmented world
expo again in the san jose area and that
is something that deals more with
augmented reality which is a little bit
different than virtual reality but a lot
of similarities the simpler concept here
inside those blue arrows i talked about
that the real world being represented by
this cue the match of the real world
augmented reality is the inverse of that
it's taken the real world embedding
computer-generated imagery with in that
room world against something that you
can't have to you see or experience
that's difficult to say in words and
lastly this is not normally been
announced yet but at secret in vancouver
this year we're actually home i'm
working with the committee now putting
together a panel of some of these
leading experts in virtual reality to
make virtual reality is on par with the
keynote at the conference is going to be
a primary theme of the conference this
year that we're going to have some big
speakers there and what may be even more
interesting to this audience is that
we're putting together a contest where
different people can submit their
material of virtual reality experiences
whether they've been working on in the
entire year and we still have some time
left right this is until August and so
if you believe you have some really
compelling ideas for virtual reality
you'll be able to submit to that and
will be you know have a panel the judges
looking at those submissions and the
best experiences or be showcasing those
that see grandpa making a big yellow so
guess you're an opportunity to show some
you know cool ideas that you have maybe
already in developing or virtual reality
gives you chance they've you know show
to the world the show to a large
audience
okay with that open the floor for
questions also i mentioned of course
contact me here at my email address and
also my much work and contact me there
okay we have a question a lot about
Bonnie presence in virtual reality
wondering how you see out haptics
getting into that and how do you see
that being implemented as well
absolutely so haptics is a big deal i
talked about that sense of kind of
proprioception is self motion but that's
all that's you know have the controllers
well some sense that's passive seat now
because I I feel at least I have
something physical in my hand so by the
sword or a gun or whatever my am least I
feel something which is very different
than Microsoft Kinect was there you know
there's advantage of the beach it
depends the network's great for some
games and so there's not like one's
better than the other but if you have
that if you're holding a physical gun
you expect haven't gone in that set to
the button of actually physically
building something so in some cases
that's better now that's all passive
happenings because the thing isn't
actually by the way there's other
controllers out there that will but you
know what tumblr right that you know
actually physically shakes so that's one
very simple case there's some company
called tactical happenings which is
using the six centuries your Hydra
controllers that I talked about they
added a really compelling sense of touch
and how they do is very interesting how
they do not by itself it's like okay
this is kind of what I feel like this
the controller essentially moves it's
got some things that you know push on
your skin you can still move it's really
cool but by them it's pretty cool by
himself and when you put in a virtual
environment now suddenly you're seeing
it and you're filling it even though
it's not going away perfect like the
real world combining those together
starts creating this or this illusion
because if generally vision dominates
the sense of touch nothing alive cases
and so now you feel like wow that was
really like
this rude coin that might not feel like
a recoil if you didn't have the visual
the visual you know compelling images
embedded within the virtual world not
just on the screen there's other things
to do I know on back in the day we used
to buy when I was at UNC we would
physically model the room and so you
could go in you know visually you be
like in a living room sort of
environment and you go up and you could
physically touch something because the
virtual world match the physical all
they were retiring on box you go up and
like okay this is pretty cool and it was
attractive so you can physically walk
around and it like a 20 by tempe area
and then you like okay this is pretty
cool and we say okay well you know reach
out and touch the table they do that
then it kind of freaked out paper book
this really is real and then they
started to believe that they touch other
things and then what we did is we said
okay now let's walk into the next room
so they physically walk into the next
room and they look down and there be a
big hole in the floor and now
instinctively they learn this is the
real world what I see as a physical
presence and freaked out so we measured
like for example heartbreak we measured
palm swag yeah it would spike when they
went in the next year and then what we
did we added one more thing is we said
okay but then if they walk out there the
illusion is going to be rooming we did
you know dig a hole in the floor we
didn't go that far what we did do is we
put an inch and a half apply with an
inch and a half then we say okay you
don't believe this go up walk to the
edge and put your toe over the edge of
that we call it the diving board over
the flora and then they get even more
less fighting
that those are passive happens active
haptics is something that you know
physically my you reach out and touch
something and you have others is famine
devices are you familiar with those
there's different types of devices that
you actually model just as you model the
root of the visually geometry this model
is a physical like a robotic arm inverse
of the robot it's able to on control
where new touching noses after where we
are in space that applies physical
forces so I've the spiritual object in
the sense that you know I intersected
that object and apply a horse back to
keep even moving through now and that's
even more compelling because that you
can dynamically change the model it's
such a good dog for artists it's great
because it can go in there and you know
actually do you know sculpting and fill
the surgeons and specifically what I was
wondering about the Amazons Asia and
handing up around yeah because that's
actually I'm going to be very hard but
you can't really just add weight to
something on your arm yep and that's so
the tactical haptics guiding guys they
kind of do that but that's one of the
big challenges right how do you change
the waiters I don't know maybe there's
like some crazy electromagnetics thing
you pick it up and some of the you know
turns on the magnet or something there's
also other what's up or something with
water programs yeah yeah I mean it's
wide open and that's why it's such an
exciting you know I can't think of it
right now but I'm sure some of you maybe
have some ideas another challenge is
when you physically you know if I have
this virtual wall here and I virtually
walk through it there's nothing stopping
so what happens do I go through the wall
because I physically walk forward or do
I stop the virtual work and say no you
can't move it it's like wait a sec I
kept walking I walked another five feet
why is the world
updating the grown and so they're
gamblers these cute conflicts that
creates this big challenge these
virtuous doesn't matter that much
they've salt something that is that and
people have double treadmills for
example they've had these crazy
treadmills to take up like an entire
room that are sort of this on active
treadmills that you start walking and
then the treadmill starts booting just
like a regular treadmill except art an
escalator for example or a moving
sidewalk but you kind of be almost
tripped when you'll be back because I
love something starting to move but i
think you know physically move start
walking and there's all these challenges
but what gone did with virtuix is he was
able to you know totally rethink and
said what if we make a passive trail or
basically you know it's not the actual
surface moving let's put it down to a
simplest form we don't have moving parts
and it's almost sort of like on roller
skates this kind of it feels like not
quite like real walking but maybe that's
okay maybe that's better than means you
know huge expensive mechanical systems
any other questions
there we go so you don't use I've been
seriously
if you're trying to achieve like
resumption of what a user we are wrong
it's how how would you college
how would you do that life here trying
to meet reception how to use
but my map of my fav visible from my
flight they're trying to do to an axe
you are pulling for example so I'm sorry
if I was out last part you brought a
bully for example bullying okobogee mmm
you bought that for example how how
would you do that room in my leg up demo
for support examples and
because they were like if it's not
realistic if you give it's like your
seven-year-old they're just like always
but without the actual reception am I
admire or how I do it won't really
change or maybe I'm just saying but how
so by Paul Anka tabatha pet at Duke
University she's got some amazing things
studying for example gender differences
are racial differences what if you put
someone in the avatar of a female even
though your nail and how can you make
them feel real and there's different
people have done studies like that
they'd actually found a difference that
people start having and after the oh I
understand how it is to do you have you
no obvious exit be discriminated against
truth serum for me it's very compelling
even if they're just cartoons it's not
you know we all my photo realism those
important for some things but it doesn't
necessarily need to be photorealistic I
think there's more important things like
a wide field of view is very important
in the sense of motion is more important
in some cases than the visual appeal you
remember graduates squad colleague Paul
Simmons that was looking at your sense
of presence and virtual environments
need bike model this really nice room
and in compared it to this very gridlock
room where you could see you know this
grid with going off in the distance and
so you know the further off something is
you know this very nice sense of visual
cues that you might not have as much
what you know a plastered wall it
doesn't happen and he found at least the
early preliminary findings were some
people actually thought more present in
that grid like because they have more of
a sense but hypothesized it was because
you got more a sense of depth you
actually have enhanced visual cues and
so it doesn't necessarily need to be you
know photo realistic if I look down and
it's a different color shirt than what
I'm wearing I'm not going to remember
what sure does i'm just i'm going to be
wow my hands man i'm going to look like
my hands just to have something like
that another way to do that is this is
where it is very near sm from like a
southern psychological point of view
it's important to have psychological
cyclone just type of blood psychologists
everybody involved with our work so what
they've done they put them in the habit
are they going okay this is cool yeah
I'm good at this kind of my body I'm
part of that is not always look at your
body right so they'll have like virtual
mirrors didn't see yourself as well we
look down to hear what they also did as
I say okay here's a virtual feather now
we're going to you know touch your arm
of this better get back to your question
about haptics not a very enough
technically advanced Harmonix but the
research would then come up and have a
real feather and rub their own with the
real feather as a virtual feather did
the same thing I was great without bond
I don't assume you mean like from the
physical or social equipment like him
when kids seizes room and okay since
dawn because that means an equally room
is
and you're having like you're trying to
get them to even stand up for himself or
to get a reaction oh that's really what
I mean I said so from the point of view
of the holier the person being bullied I
try to get them to change their mental
their young fit mentally well maybe
related and give this I don't know the
answers to all these things yeah I bet
it's a good question and sometimes when
you don't know the answer that probably
means it's a good question right but
going back of each other differences
they actually found that that would
change how people thought of you know oh
I'm making me and you know these sexist
remarks or something don't think nothing
of them maybe as a guy because you never
thought about it but if you put them in
the from a female perspective then
suddenly they start thinking all about
we can do you can have empathy with it
with female females now realize up reorg
or you know changing their sense of
height this chimney and how people
realize up you know people experience
the world differently if we're a
different night another example of that
is public speak there's no studies where
they put someone in a virtual room with
that virtual avatar audience and the
psychology that just is pretty cool
stuff what they've done studies like you
know big audience like you guys are
paying attention to me right so it's
easy for what happens if the audience is
nodding off or people are you know not
paying attention they're looking at
their cell phones what happens and they
found them it's a huge difference when
they put people in these virtual
environments even though they're just
cartoon characters they're so obviously
not real their behavior actually
suggests that they do believe these
characters are real and an extreme case
what they do they add up one of the one
of the 10 10 G's of the practicing of
the speech get up and scream and run out
of the room
and so that was a good example how you
can you can play yes
over
yeah there's been a lot of research over
glass like 30 years applied towards on
jet fighter pilots that you know and
what's interesting about that is there's
a lot of data the problem is it's not
arguably not validated the reason why is
because if you're a jet fighter pilot
and your report simulator sickness is
probably going to be a while before you
fly again so they drastically
underestimated how many people get
simulator sickness the general finding
was there yeah don't do you know stupid
things don't do crazy things but it's
not that bad and now you know we
hopefully will get more of an honest
feedback on that there's some academic
research on that but it's not really
brought together trying to think offhand
a website or something for that it's
something personally I want to do more
research on and you know test those blue
arrows for example like that's my
hypothesis i tested i'm obviously
violence maybe my users advice because i
say hey try this is cool right unbiased
true formal studies that's I think for
you know this sort of virtual reality
that are not you know these high-end
simulators is completely home so sorry i
can answer bedroom that and it would
Roger up up saw answer this real quick
then we can talk afterwards which is
kind of a situation since signifie house
series of anyone thought
testing out by trim or a judgment for
avoiding or reducing knowledgeable young
so when I was working with Val that was
kind of a joke like I came in one day
because you know i was doing crazy hi
he's crazy cat head mounted displays
before Dracula's came out and you know
someone had taped some some of that to
my guests right so that was kind of a
joke but somehow I've never tried it but
others have reported that they have and
that works again that's bias because you
know maybe it's the placebo effect we
don't know but then again my argument of
the placebo effect is psychologically
that's what's interesting is buying it's
a placebo effect repairs it works right
but for no studies of that would be very
interesting I think it's one of those
things that probably works for some
people and doesn't wear other it's just
like being a real room when you go on
the boat it works for some people are
not others either placebo or not will
need to do you no harm studies good okay
with that we'll move on to our next
speaker and again I invite you to come
down to the next gen interactions food
court will be showing the game with
shark tank we don't have the virtuix
Omni unfortunately I try to get here
won't be able to get it till later this
summer so maybe next year I'll be able
to show that whole system here and so
come on down I highly recommend to stay
for richard boyd speech coming up next
he's has been doing for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
