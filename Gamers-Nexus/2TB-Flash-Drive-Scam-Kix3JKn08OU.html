nine dollars on eBay
and it's not because I'm good at finding
deals it's because of a scam clearly 2
terabytes on flash drive as many of you
know it's not 9 dollars in fact you can
buy one of the Kingston ones that came
out at CES for more than a grand I think
they were nearing $2,000 so anyone who
thinks this is 9 bucks and is also 2
terabytes is probably just not informed
and I think that's who they're targeting
but if we look here at eBay you can
scroll through and see that there are
dozens of these all over the place they
range from 5 bucks to maybe 30 bucks in
fact some of them I think this is even
the one we got exactly for $7.00 now I
got ripped off apparently too much less
but some of them are even gold-plated
the 30 bucks I didn't want to get ripped
off that much but we didn't want to get
ripped off a bit so I bought the two
terabyte one it's got a holographic
sticker on it is a flash drive and if we
plug it in you will see that in fact
this is plugged them wrong way twice as
is the standard with USB when we plug it
in we've got our files I moved a bunch
of ASCII ends over here Windows thinks
this thing is 1.9 terabyte it thinks
it's 2 terabytes but in reality what
we've done is moved about 20 gigabytes
of files over here and you will see that
clicking through them some of them will
play completely and some will not this
file plays completely it is 5 gigabytes
so we've got at least 5 gigabytes of
space hey Paul this is a 4 gigabyte file
and this one in fact also plays
completely so we've got at least nine
gigabytes of real space of this file we
start to have some problems with cannot
render the file doesn't exist doesn't
work data's not on there this file
cannot render the file and this one we
can play I think about half of it it
just breaks on a very flattering frame
so I would put this up probably about a
16 gigabyte Drive since it's 9 and then
we've got a bunch of broken data and
that have worked maybe 10 gigabytes
something weird like that what that
tells us is it's a 2 terabyte fake drive
so how do they get it to pay to hear
rights in Windows that can be done by
spoofing the controller which is on the
it's inside the physical flash drive is
a controller just like there's a flash
controller for your SSD it can be
spoofed in a way that Windows believes
that it's much larger capacity than in
reality this is also if we were to pull
it apart you'd see that it's just one
tiny flash sigh that's probably a couple
gigabytes so it's really just a PSA
don't buy these things I'm sure most of
you would not have done that anyway this
strikes me as a type of thing that a non
enthusiast might buy but they're out
there plenty of fake things we'll be
looking at more of those in the coming
week because a fun thing to do
previously we looked at fake cables and
fake DVI cables you can check that out
on the channel from years ago but we
will be doing a series subscribe for
more as always patreon.com slash gamers
Nexus to help us out directly and
perhaps we can use that funding to buy
more 2 terabyte flash drives for $9 I'll
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
