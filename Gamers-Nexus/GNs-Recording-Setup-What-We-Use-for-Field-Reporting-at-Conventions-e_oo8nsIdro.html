dotnet and i'm doing something a bit
different today we're actually i'm just
showing off some new equipment that i'll
be using for CES 2014 packs 2014 all of
those events so i really just wanted to
kind of introduce you guys to our new
arsenal because in my opinion it's quite
impressive at least for a medium sized
outlet like us it is a lot of fun to use
what we've got here first of all this is
a microphone i bought maybe about two
years ago for the site it is an MD 65 I
want to say from from sennheiser so this
is not new however the recording device
it is plugged into is new and this is
actually a roland AR 05 record it's
pretty simple icon and eighty dollar a
reporter type recorder there you go so
this just drops into my back pocket when
i'm doing interviews I'll no longer have
a 15 foot long cable running to the
microphone right running to the camera
from the microphone rather and of course
that means we can do all kinds of new
shots at conventions we won't be getting
in the way anymore which is pretty nice
and and and it does record at a
significantly higher bitrate it is a
24-bit audio recording device at 96
kilohertz which translates to something
like 4,000 kilobits per second so very
high audio we can render it all out at
320 kilobits per second probably so
that's the recorder and other than the
recorder i have a new camera that you
can't see unless i use my old camera to
show you go figure right that's how
lenses work apparently they cannot turn
inward so here's what i used to record
with at these conventions pretty pretty
standard small consumer level camera
really not all that impressive but
pretty damn good for what it was doing
it is a vixia i want to say hf 20 i
think and this i've been using for a
couple of years not a very wide angle
lens pretty limited and it's low light
capabilities it drops the frame rate to
compensate for low light and a couple of
you have complains about low frame rates
in some of our videos this is why i
finally figured that out so the new
camera is a canon x 8 20 and it records
at 28 megabits per second of course this
is significantly faster than most of our
download rates on
fortunately that is the world we live in
but it is 28 megabits per second and and
it does record at 60fps are pretty cool
for any kind of slow stuff we want to do
if we want to shoot like so we're doing
a smoke test on a case we can slow that
down two times which is which is really
I've got those I've shrouded in cameras
and hardware I've got this GoPro hero3
that I use really more as a hobbyist
thing for bike videos but I am planning
to use it for smoke testing rigs in the
future this year so we can slow down
smoke flowing through a case I think
I'll capture it at I want to say 120 FPS
which I can slow down about four times
and it will still look pretty good so
that will show you the air channels when
smoke flows through the fans so you can
kind of follow where the smoke is going
and see where vortex is for them with
different fans getting off-topic he got
the idea pretty cool stuff so that's our
new camera I did get a microphone with
it has a shotgun mic which will improve
the quality of discussion panels greatly
so the shotgun mic is I actually
honestly don't even remember what it is
it was like a 3 out of Dodge shotgun mic
but significantly higher quality and it
will be used as our backup Mike and
interviews as well because it does
provide some redundancy in case in case
this device fails or something happens
so that's what we've got in terms of
Mike and audio I've even got these
little pretty standard white balance
cards these are these are pretty normal
in the photography industry I just never
use them for GN so we've got three
shades here we have a 60 something
percent gray or black a peer black and a
pure white and I can use that to set the
white balance before a shot which means
of course that the lighting will look a
lot better so those are our primary
devices this is the camera I'm shooting
with it is a sony a 65 camera i'm
currently i've got a 17 250 millimeter
lens i believe it's 2.8 I think it's a
2.8 lens 17 250 some tamarind you know
used off ebay type of thing the age 65
is a pretty good camera for what I got
it for I got it maybe a year ago I
it's two years old now and and it it
shoots very good pictures video is good
but it really struggles in low light it
doesn't compensate really at all so that
had to go for video but it does good
photos other than that I guess I will
show off take this opportunity and show
off the new shirts you might notice I'm
wearing one if you are a regular to the
site so I got a I got quite a few of
these printed quick shout out to the
local screen printer logo Jose I do
appreciate him throwing in a few extra
shirts for me so these are the shirts
and actually I guess I can just right
there it does have a pretty cool logo on
the back I will be role that in since my
hands are quite full right now and the
logo actually is an artist's liberties
taken on an end to chemical structure so
it's just two nitrogen right and the
reason for that is because ln2 as in
liquid nitrogen is used in overclocking
and so from an enthusiast perspective we
wanted to work liquid nitrogen into the
shirt this was an easy way to do it we
took some liberties replaced the first
end with the G gamers nexus of course
change the bonding and the center two
traces on a motherboard circuit races
and then through only two out of the I
believe eight electrons on there so just
kind of a cool thing these will be
available for purchase on the website i
should note that there will be i think
i'm going to list them at twenty bucks
in 100 century yet but they will
probably listed at about 20 bucks I've
lxl an M and if you want to support the
site it's a great way to do it I will of
course be giving many of these away and
it also says hardware enthusiast on the
website on it so pretty cool stuff very
exciting for the new year here and a
YouTube channel is getting a good deal
of new content go check out our how to
build a gaming computer video I finally
produced one of those you've been asking
for a couple of years finally got around
to it is pretty it's pretty
comprehensive but it's also short right
it's only 15 minutes some of the other
videos out there like an hour lon and I
thought I can do it faster so it does
make some assumptions that you are a
functioning human be
in with the brain but you it's it's just
the main stuff cables and stuff like
that so go check that out check out the
site and feel free to ask any questions
if you're like just getting into media
or you're really interested in what we
do or what I do or any of this other
stuff post a comment and just ask me
whatever and I'll help you out and yeah
that's all for now so I will see you all
from the show floor at CES 2014 next
week and yeah peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
