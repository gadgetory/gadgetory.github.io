you missed our three hour long
livestream basically our goal it was a
friendly media battle with lioness media
group and their team they passed one of
our top 10 rankings recently for the
3dmark Hall of Fame and we can't really
compete in the same league as people
like kingpin or dev our when he's
actually trying but we can compete in
the same league as - so that was what
the livestream was this is a quicker
recap for you this is a test bench it's
a little crazy we have to 360 rads right
here I'm going to go through all the
parts and we'll go through all the
settings that we used and then and talk
a bit about some of the overclocking
challenges endeavors we went through for
this stream before that this video is
brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer
learn more at the link in the
description below so let's start with
the bench components first of all this
is our Titan V it's been put under a
water block from ek we shorted the
shunts on it some people complain that
shorting shots is bad for them I don't
care one it's not your card - we're
competitively overclocking I buy it for
purposes of using it to make money
because that's what a media production
channel does so really that opinion is
irrelevant but the point is we shorted
the shunts on the Titan v which did give
us an extra couple percentage points in
terms of performance because it helps
smooth out the frequency a bit we've got
that under an EK water block for the
Titan V which is going to an ek 360
radiator and then for cooling options
this is a completely closed loop I mean
it's an open loop technically but it's
only going to the GPU so we have pumping
and reservoir for that plus the 360
radiator to much we have mounted a soon
on Maglev fan this is the supplier for
Corsairs magma fans we have a Corsair ml
fan up here we have an ek Vardar
it's a bit of a mix of things and then
for the other radiator we have two ml
pros and one of the ml nan pros it's a
thermal take flow radiator or liquid
cooler so the choices for both of these
were to isolate the loops first of all
and then also you just fast pumps you
get the liquid into the radiator as
quickly as we could and cool it down so
the CPU and the GPU are entirely in
closed loops for other cooling elements
we had thermal grizzly cryo not on the
GPU for thermal paste we had fuji polly
pads that we just recently bought a
bunch of plus we had a viewer sent some
in for separate tests and we'll be doing
later
thermal grizzly cryo not on the thermal
take liquid cooler and then under the
IHS we have thermal Grizzly conduct or
not so we've got liquid metal going to
the IHS and then a high high thermal
conductivity paste going to the cold
plate for the motherboard we've gotten
EVGA x2 989 dark board that actually has
proven to be extremely good we really
like the dark motherboard so far you can
see build Zoids PCB over here on our
channel for more on that but it's a it's
got two small fans on the vrm they were
completely within check the whole time
there's also a knock to a fan up here
this is an NFA 14 I think that was
placed there because we weren't fully
confident that the every component on
the card was getting proper cooling from
the block
we had about 90 percent confidence but
just to make sure we didn't get a
thermal shutdown from anything
overheating or any runaway issues with
the arms that were uncovered stuff like
that because it was all thrown together
quickly we just put a knock to a fan up
there to blast air down the back and the
front of the card just to make sure it's
cooled so that's most of the components
in t'lie 939 a DX II which became a meme
on the stream that's the CPU we use we
had it overclocked a bit I'll go through
those settings later and for the power
supply also important we had a Corsair a
X 1600 I which is one of the best power
supplies you can get right now however
this stream before we even started
started out by tripping the circuit
breaker that the system was on because
we had this plugged in with the
streaming pc plugged in and this machine
was drawing about a thousand watts on
its own so that's how we were a bit late
but that's the system memory
g.skill Trident Z is what we end up
using it's thirty six hundred megahertz
kit we overclocked it to four thousand
mega Hertz and I think it's CL I don't
know if it's sixteen or eighteen but we
brought down the timings a bit as well
across the board so that's pretty much
what we use now that we've gone over the
hardware so you know what we use to get
the scores the next thing is to look at
the scores themselves and how we got
them from a software side so we ended up
there are two different ranking systems
we're placing on one is the 3d mark Hall
of Fame that's the one that 3d mark and
feature mark regulate and have ownership
of the other ones Hardware bar or HW bot
and we submitted scores to each so we
end up with fourth place four times five
extreme single GPU on the 3d mark Hall
of Fame which is right above gunslinger
who holds a score of 82 63 and right
below JP actually not write quite a bit
below JPM boy who holds a score of 84 89
we were at 80 to 85
so the distance there is primarily
established at this point by things like
ln2 chillers better cooling systems
things like that the kingpin of course
way far and away at the top with 9,000
points so for our score we end up
pushing a bit further after the stream
ended and the primary contributors to
increase in the score were allowing the
room to cool down the room got pretty
warm running the benchmarks for two and
a half hours plus the streaming
equipment so am bein room temperature
drops by about 4 degrees Celsius after
we stop the stream that was enough to
give the Titan be a bit more thermal
Headroom for boosting a bit higher and
then the other significant change was I
pushed the CPU so that the first two
cores were 49 X multiplier instead of 48
the rest were 48 and then we pushed the
GPU overclocked a bit higher as well 115
megahertz for the HBM 115 for the core
which seems to be about where stability
stopped so that extra 15 megahertz or so
for hbm's who actually helped a lot and
our score was comprised of a graphic
score of 78 73 and a CPU score of 11,000
779 for the next rank up that would be
JP Mboya
80
for 89 points which although it doesn't
look like a lot is actually a pretty
significant lead and JPM boys score is
comprised of an eighty two hundred and
three graphic score and ten thousand 586
cpu score so he's actually about a
thousand twelve hundred points behind in
CPU and about four hundred points ahead
and GPU and despite us still having a
greater lead in terms of cpu score the
difference here is that four times by
extreme which is primarily GPU bound GPA
score matters the most and this ranking
system illustrates that because he ends
up with two hundred more total points at
eighty four eighty nine while having an
extra 400 GPU and a deficit of twelve
hundred per CPU so that's most of the
scoring difference above JPM boy is
slinky and I'm kingpin and both of those
are significantly higher that gets into
ln2 overclocking class whereas we were
running with just air and liquid and
then below us is gunslinger for point of
reference - tech tips and team they're
eighty ninety two score was comprised of
a seventy seven thirty one graphics
score pretty close to ours and a CPU
score somewhat distant at eleven
thousand nine and that's partly because
they didn't really optimize much of
their platform on the memory side or the
CPU side but they had a pretty good GPU
in terms of pinning so what that shows
is that GPA score matter is a lot more
four times by extreme because times by
extreme is primarily GPU bound so an
extra couple hundred points in GPU one
is way harder to achieve than a extra
couple hundred points in CPU up until a
certain degree and also has way more
weight to it so yeah that other 200
points for GPU is not really going to be
feasible for us on the card we have
without some kind of more exotic cooling
to push it there so hopefully that gives
kind of an idea for what we ended up
doing in terms of memory tweaking
there's still room to go we were stable
at one point at CL 15 we ran CL 16 for
the entire stream so we might have
another couple points we could add out
there but I ended up just going for CL
16 because I didn't want to fight with
the memory for
off the stream it's just not fun for
anyone but overall 4.9 gigahertz on two
cores 4.8 on the rest for the other
settings I've topped my head I think
we're at one point three five one point
three six vcore for the CPU and we were
one point nine five for the other CPU
voltage setting with the extreme voltage
option enabled we also had a VSA of 1.2
to 5 io of 1.2 v mesh offset 500
millivolts and mesh was at 32x as well
which seems pretty standard for these AV
x offsets disabled memory we had a
couple tune settings on it so here's
what we had from memory this is a thirty
six hundred megahertz g.skill kit as
noted earlier we set up to 4,000
megahertz we set the dim voltage 21.85
it was some i stable at 1.8 as noted CL
16 with 2640 wrasse
other changes include r rd s @ 4r dl at
6 we had t fought at 16 think it
defaults to something like 44 and then
command rate 1 of course for the rest TW
r is a setting that we might be able to
drive drive down to 16 but it would
require a tighter maximum setting you
can set maximum in windows through ms
config and tell how much memory to limit
itself to but we would need to restrict
that more which would cut into our time
spy extreme memory requirements so left
it auto for now set 340 RFC maxed out TR
efi at 32 77 and 640 c ke then
everything that was set to 15 auto we
changed to 6 so that b RW d r r w DD and
r WS r so those are the main memory
settings we changed i guess we can I'll
just show you the BIOS settings for the
CPU as well through this one all the
voltages obviously you know this do this
at your own risk you can damage things
stuff
that but we did a 1.95 for vin 1.36
vcore which was pushing us to about 95
degrees Celsius and worth cases and
that's where we start running to limits
unlike GPUs their CPUs are less
sensitive they just have a hard to stop
1.35 4v mesh and for the uncor offset as
I was talking about earlier 500
millivolts encore offset with IO 1.2 sa
1.2 to 5 as noted earlier so those are
all of our settings if you were curious
about them and 49 on the cores camera or
if we ran that for the final square I
think we did though it's semi-stable
some benchmarks cause that to crash
others don't but that's that's pretty
much all the BIOS settings if you were
curious and finally for scoring and for
where everyone lands four times why
extreme 80 to 85 was our final score
that put us at fourth place for
reference the lioness was our benchmark
to beat he was at eighty ninety one and
during the live stream we had a point
where we hit 80 no he's at 80 92 during
the live stream we had a point where we
hit 80 91 so we were one point away
which is within margin of error we ended
up doing some tuning - it got 80 99 for
the first score that beat lionesses team
score and then after that our next push
was 280 215 I think and then 80 222 and
then later 82 85 which shows you just
how much an extra couple megahertz here
and there can get you for fire strike
semi competitive benchmarking because
it's a matter of 15 extra megahertz if
you quit before then that's another one
or two places in the leaderboard we
would have fallen down so lioness ends
up at seventh and hopefully he'll he'll
retaliate and do something to challenge
us we're in fourth right now four times
by extreme 80 to 85 versus his 80 92
we've got serve and gunslinger between
us JPM boy above GN with the more
unreachable levels King Ben and slinky
above that four times by normal non
extreme so first disclaimer all these
next few benchmarks didn't really try
very hard and they have different
requirements some of them are more CPU
bound we didn't tune any further we just
ran the same settings we did
by extreme what you shouldn't do but
four times by normal we end up at 15
four nine four which is eighth place and
then for fire strike ultra eighth place
at nine thousand six fifty five not too
far away from seventh if we wanted to
push for fire strike extreme we ended up
in fourth place behind Johnny Flash and
slinky PC we could probably try and push
for third but fourth is where we are
right now and then for fire strike the
normal one thirty two thousand seven
ninety three points this is becoming
more of a CPU bound test to some extent
and that has a nine so that's that's the
whole scoring hierarchy of where we
ended up at the end of that stream lots
of fun
hardware bots were in third four times
by extreme fewer people submit there but
I want to make one point here before we
close out and that's for anyone at
Hardware bot if you're listening or
anyone else who runs a competitive
overclocking site in speaking with some
of the people I've worked with on the
overclocking side I think we can all
agree to some extent that need to be
price divisions of some kind kind of
like anything else where there's
competition like I don't know a
track-day with cars or something if
you're getting semi-serious with
competition there should be some kind of
cutoff in terms of how much money you
can put into your test vehicle in this
case our test bench and compete within
the same class of people so a world
record ranking where it's just anything
goes it's cool that's basically we have
now at the same time though a lot of the
overclockers you really deserve to be
competing who are more serious
overclockers than we are don't
necessarily have $5,000 worth of two
parts GP is three grand CP is two
thousand or something like that and the
motherboards 500 the memory is very
expensive these days so what I'm getting
at is this is a lot of fun but also
people like Linus and even to some
extent really us we don't have a whole
lot of business being in the top ten the
reason people like Linus and myself can
get there is because we have the
hardware from review
that we do and because as a business
that does review is not overclocking we
can buy those parts so it's a little
unfair to be sitting on top of between
two parts $5,000 of components for all
the people who are much better
overclockers in a skill sense but don't
have the same parts arsenal that we do
so I would love to see Hardware bots or
someone else make price divisions where
they're like the limit for this category
is $2,000 and your prices need to align
with whatever's on nu I gammas on
whatever otherwise you can't enter
because you'll be over the the price
value for your rig and you'll be in the
next price category that's limited at
$4,000 something like that because
otherwise what will happen is as Nvidia
and Intel continue to push these ultra
high in parts the charts will just be
filled with media who don't deserve to
be there but have access to everything
so that's all I want to say on that lots
of fun though for the live stream thank
you for joining to watch it if you were
there we will do more of these in the
future not sure when yet make sure to
follow us on Twitter so you can catch
the next one and of course for all of
you who bought the mod mat during the
live stream thank you go to store it on
gamers nexus net to buy one of the new
mod mats we will be shipping them in
about a week to ten days now they are
already in the US just waiting for them
to get to us then they'll go out the
door to everyone who bought them so pick
one of those up and that's all for this
one thank you for watching subscribe for
