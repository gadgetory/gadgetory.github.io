now there are three million true to
downloads 319 CUDA applications 800
universities around the world this is
basically the globe 800 universities
around the world now teach could attend
GPU acceleration 60,000 papers 60,000
papers citing the use of GPUs for the
research and 450,000 GPUs now power
supercomputers I can read performs
computing centers all over the world and
this statistics is absolutely shocking
there are now 54th petabytes of combined
high-performance computing power that no
powers to gloat amazing progress amazing
progress in just a few years I want to
thank all of you
the promise that we made you and the
promise we fight every day to keep are
several things one we promised about
adding a GPU into your platform and by
you making the effort to program that
GPU we will accelerate your code like
seller your code out by a little bit
what's over you go dramatically number
two now we seek always to find that fine
balance between enhancing your
productivity of making it easier and
easier to program this platform
enhancing your productivity while number
at the same time never losing sight of
that fine delicate balance between easy
to program to use a computer and that
computer being incredibly fast most of
the applications we serve are really
about speed without the speed it is
simply impossible for you to do your
work one of my favorite quotes and I
sent this to you guys a couple years ago
was when a researcher came to me and
said Jensen because of your work I'm now
able to do my life's work in my life
that is what it's all about we have to
find that delicate balance creature
programmability and speed and the number
three asks us any of computing
architecture worth assault is really
about access you need to be able to
reach out and any researcher any student
anything
or anywhere in the world in any industry
should be able to reach out very easily
and find this architecture one of the
things that were most proud of and it
was a sacrifice made early on it's put
CUDA on every single GPU long the poor
people count value with value in it by
making it available on every single GPU
from desktops to laptops to
supercomputers to data centers and now
in mobile devices and now your cars by
putting CUDA in every single GPU we make
it as easy as possible for you to
develop and deploy your software and
then lastly of course the beauty of an
architecture once you develop the
software if your partner is dedicated to
advance that architecture day in and day
out day in and day out without you
having to let your finger again the
investment that you make improves over
time all by itself the power of Moore's
Law and that's what we promised you and
today I'd like to show you that in every
possible way we're living up to that
promise ladies and gentlemen let me
introduce our brand new GPU the time NEX
roll it goes
and that's how you announce a new GPU
ladies and gentlemen is our next
eight billion transistors the first
cheat the first chip we designed the
first graphic chipman design called
repolish p it was four million
transistors or million transistors a
small difference since then this is
eight billion transistors the team did
just a fantastic job three thousand foot
of course the highest single per shift
precision krupa of a GPU ever created
it's designed for single precision is
designed with a 12 gigabyte frame buffer
and as you will see in just a moment
reasons why we made such choices for
people who want double precision we
still have tightened Z times Z is still
the fastest single card well precision
should be here we have the type of X is
the highest performance single precision
the largest frame bumpers and most
advanced GPU architecture create this is
all based on maxvill okay ladies and
gentlemen the type Nick's now let's take
a look at what techniques can do this is
work that we're about to show you that
was done by a company called epic epic
is a long-term partner of ours they're
aimed engine company they are the game
engine you choose if you're developing a
triple a title now the animation you're
about to see is completely in real time
it was running on one tighten it
everything you're about to see is real
time running on one Titan X it captures
a hundred square miles of 3d graphics
literally a hundred square miles of 3d
graphics basically the entire Silicon
Valley you're not going to see Silicon
Valley's you're going to see something a
little more beautiful
100 squared lots 15 million plants
you're going to see 15 million planets
this in charge of rain was
photometrically scam because no it's
impossible for artists to a captured
landscape that beautiful that great any
given frame is 20 30 million polygons
everything is an HDR the camera effects
are beautiful you're going to see
physically based in rhetoric rocks look
like rocks water looks like water the
shadows are beautiful you might notice
some rim lining on off the shoulders
this animation this rendering real-time
graphics is the most beautiful as I've
ever seen and this is just incredible
were quite a team at epic I love their
work and they just out themselves yet
again
it's utterly utterly life-changing and
I'm going to show you some other results
in just a moment but that tells you what
time Nexus can do and is the reason why
we do all of that all of that in your
hands researchers all over the world 999
yep that's coming for not
just think about that 999 you'll pay for
it in an afternoon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
