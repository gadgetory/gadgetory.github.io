nexus Donette and today were talking
from out amd's new r9 fury ex shown here
and the reason we're talking about this
today is not our full review which is
forthcoming but actually look at the
drivers and there was a forum thread
that sparked after some of the initial
reviews launched of the fury x and that
thread i believe on reddit was sort of
suggesting that maybe the press drivers
were poor performing than the official
release drivers and this is actually
something that has happened in the past
for both companies and the in nvidia so
it's worth investigating and before we
could test it AMD unofficially responded
to an overclockers thread about this
question stating that no the v8 and
benign press drivers which were released
on the ftp that we have access to should
perform effectively identically to the
15 15 1004 drivers that are available to
the public and even with their word on
the forums we wanted to validate this
internally ourselves because it's very
important that we understand fully if
this is actually an issue or not because
if it is an issue and we review this
card and we use the press drivers or use
the release drivers there will be a
disparity between other reviews and it
might not be a real-world scenario so i
tested all three driver sets before
embarking further on our official review
and as you can see in these results
there is effectively zero difference
there is a slight difference but it's
within margin of error every single time
it's not only 1 FPS one direction or the
other and this was after averaging
multiple test passes for each driver set
so as indicated by these games there is
ZERO difference between the fury x
release drivers which are the ones that
we would have access to now now that the
card is out and the AMD press drivers
which were available before the launch
of the card i want to also note that
this is a retail version of the card to
my knowledge it is the only retail
version of the card that is being worked
on by an official outlet being reviewed
by an outlet and this is significant
because they can sometimes be
differences in iterations between
pre-production or press cards
fall production shipping retail units
and that's what this is here so we have
two of these as you can see they are
provided by one of our readers very
graciously on loan I've got review of
that coming up crossfire all of that but
as it stands now the driver issue it's
non-existent and we will look more
importantly at the difference between
the fury ex the 980 TI the 980 I hybrid
which I liked quite a bit but is one
hundred dollars more than this and other
nearby cards to determine what's best
for each to rheank gaming scenario and
cost scenario so that is all for this
video check the link in the description
below for the full article on this topic
and be sure to subscribe for the review
once it's up which it will be very
shortly at this point and then of course
our patreon campaign is worth checking
out if you don't know what that is hit
the link over the patreon icon once the
postural video rolls and I will see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
