hardware news recap for the last week in
this one we're talking about tsmc and
their five nanometer process that's
aiming to deliver a 1.8 X density
improvement Intel's got a 56 core
cascade Lake CPU and Andy sales are
expected to surge and second half of
2019 behind its major Computex
announcements before that this video is
brought to you by EVGA SZ 390 dark
motherboard the Z 390 dark is a flagship
motherboard for Intel's unlocked case
cue CPUs with tuning done by overclocked
engineering team kingpin and 10 to
enable higher memory and CPU frequencies
the motherboard uses a unique rotated
socket design to move EPS 12-volt cables
to the right side making cable
management easier and also sticks to two
DIMM slots to improve memory
overclocking stability and Headroom we
previously analyzed the BRM in full and
found it among the best in class 4 z 390
overclocking and it also got rid of RGB
LEDs learn more at the link in the
description below
TSMC is the first one so TSM C is
working on 592 process in fact it's
finished its infrastructure analysis and
risk assessment for the upcoming process
and this looks like it will continue to
leverage the foundries EUV or extreme
ultraviolet technology which is
undoubtedly a bit more mature at this
point compared to TSM C's 7 nanometer
process 5 nanometer will yield a density
increase of 1.8 X according to TSM C's
update on their website and a 15% clock
speed increased due to process
refinements alone those numbers have
currently been tested on an ARM Cortex
a 72 core and tsmc said their 5
nanometer process will power HPC
applications SOC designs AI and the
emerging 5g market among other things so
TSM C's customers already have 5
nanometer based chips in risk analysis
right now and production which could
mean volume production in the next
couple of years
Intel announces a 56 core cascade Lake
CPU and then also new octane memory dips
on other things so in thought recently
held its data centric innovation day
wherein it announced a wide gamut of
products designed
to help propel the company forward with
its new mantra of quote moving storing
and processing data it's very exciting
qiyam on the announcements was the 56
core cascade Lake Xeon Platinum 9200 CPU
and this is a part of intel's second
generation of Xeon scalable family
notably aside from the 56 core 112
thread count the Platinum 9200 will also
offer some new and hopefully enhanced in
silicon mitigations for side-channel
attacks like speculative executions hack
specter meltdown things like that it all
sees an overhauled 12 channel memory
controller which will support Intel's
new ddr4 compatible obtain DC persistent
memory dims obtain dims were so the most
interesting things that we saw a couple
of years ago now at the original Intel
often reveal where a lot of you got the
same introduction that we did which was
opt in was a small m2 SSD that you put
in with a hard drive to accelerate
things it was basically a cache drive
not very exciting to any of us octane is
a bit more than that though so the dims
do look promising and interesting
especially for data center applications
and that's one of the things that was
announced alongside this Intel announced
the 10 nanometer agile X FPGA
Intel 800 series 100 Gigabit Ethernet
cards xeon d 1600 SOC and more so quick
G unrelated note here in the middle of
these news items the GN Steve
side-channel is getting some more
updates so we're planning to start
publishing videos regularly every Sunday
we've already done the last two weeks so
we have one on my bike frame cracking if
you're into mountain biking and seeing
some of the hardware behind that and
custom bike builds and then we have
another one on my worst crash for the
season of 2018 with downhill season so
you can check that out on the GM Steve
side channel the link below if you're
interested but it's it's mostly gonna be
mountain biking stuff with some
snowflake clips so anyway the next news
item it's time to take the tinfoil hats
off for this one because Epic Games has
finally responded to allegations that
their epic games launcher famous for
exclusive games and things like
fortnight is riddled with Chinese
spyware
so it took epic a little while to
officially respond to this one at least
in the capacity that they've just done
through Tim Sweeney the CEO and this is
one of the longer standing reddit
originated theories about the epic games
launcher is that it's telemetry data is
in fact spyware from China and this
comes from the fact that
Tencent Holdings a China based company
investment firm has a 40% stake in epic
games after a long period of silence and
growing
apparently increasingly bothered by the
misinformation Tim Sweeney finally the
CEO posted the following tweet Sweeney
said quote I support everyone's right to
complain about technology industry stuff
epic store with exclusive games and a
Spartan feature set is a fine target for
iron but please help separate facts and
opinions from allies about spyware and
foreign control in Tim Sweeney it
further said that he holds full
responsibility 100% of it for any sort
of direction changing decisions that
affect epic games including the epic
store and he also noted that $0.10 40%
ownership does not grant the company any
overriding decision-making powers so if
you choose to believe Tim Sweeney that's
the end of that conspiracy theory and
these sales expected to surge and second
half of 2019 behind Rison 3000 and navi
or at least the navi tech unveil that's
expected at Computex Andy's outlook for
2019 is expected to be pretty good so
according to a report from digit times
as Andy ramps at 7 nanometer catalog for
later this year it is expected to gain
an acute advantage over Intel and poise
itself for a surge in sales now a quick
side note here we have a video where we
spoke with David Cantor one of the most
respected industry analysts about 10
nanometer and 7 nanometre and how just
that that 10 nanometer that 7 animator
doesn't necessarily mean a whole lot
without the rest of the story so
Intel's 10 nanometer should be
comparable if it ever comes out to a.m.
these seven nanometer
in some ways so just because the numbers
lower doesn't make it instantly better
keep that in mind but anyway
and these rise in 3000 series ends and
two architectures are rumored to bring
increased performance to single threaded
applications which is something that
Andy has been working on since the
launch of Verizon and this is also
allegedly going to bring some parity
with Intel CPUs while maintaining a
multi-core performance and he also has
the seven nanometer Rome based epic
processors waiting in the wings with a
64 core 112 thread flagship there's also
the second generation of Navi rumored to
be at Computex all fabricated on 7
nanometer and the new process and that
momentum weighed against in tiles
continued 10 nano meter hurdles and 14
nanometer CPU shortages that have
impacted the sales performance
significantly it's expected that this
will be a buoy for AMD sales in second
half of 2019 more OEMs like HP and
Lenovo are turning to Andy to fill
orders this is something that at
Computex AMD told us directly it is
trying to work on more where Andy
understood its weakest point was with
the OEMs and the system integrators
where most of them still work
exclusively with Intel or offer
exclusively Intel parts that is changing
though and is what am these next biggest
target was because clearly Rison is
recognized in the enthusiasts audience
whether or not you actually have a rise
in CPU you know what it is and you
likely know it's performance whereas in
the OEM and si audience it's nowhere to
be found or in very few places so that's
what's changing it looks like AMD is
also seeking its first Chromebook
adoption from the likes of HP and Acer
Intel finally hired a new CFO to fill
the vacated position left by Bob Swan
who assumes permanent CEO duties in
January this time Intel decided it would
hire from rival Qualcomm and give AMD
and NVIDIA a break former Qualcomm CFO
and vice president George S Davis left
Qualcomm on April 2nd to become Intel's
new CFO effective April 3rd Davis will
report directly to CEO Swan Davis and
Swan have prior experience working
together as well as both are employees
of Applied Materials incorporated in n
tiles been on a bit of a
lately pushing a lot of fabrication
plant improvements building new plants
and hiring people like Tom Peterson we
discussed in the last episode which by
the way has been 100% confirmed at this
point all that was mostly confirmed last
episode anyway so Intel's really looking
to get serious it's still kind of a mess
with some of the launches but the
company is is starting to really turn
that ship as slowly as it may turn it is
in fact turning Corsair speaking of
ships issues a recall on the H 100 I RGB
platinum as a cooler so if you have one
you might want to pay attention in a
forum post of course they're issued it's
recall on a select batch of the H 100 i
RGB platinum se closed-loop liquid
coolers the recall allegedly affects
fewer than 1% of the coolers in total
and it does not appear to be widespread
or pervasive as a manufacturing issue
but you still may want to check if you
have one so here's what's going on the
cooler is limited to the lock code one
eight five two if your serial number
involves those numbers you might want to
send it back they are leaking coolant
into the tubes leaving due to a faulty
seal unfortunately this is just
something that happens with mass
production where because they're working
with a lot of factories every now and
then you get a bad batch this appears to
be one of them the leak should be easy
to identify the coolant is bright green
in color it is not toxic its propylene
glycol and distilled water so you're
fine there but you still don't want it
leaking because then you're not gonna
cool anything and you don't want it
dripping all over the system and anyway
so the coolant is leaking into the
sleeve it should be apparent immediately
if you just look at it but this could
also be a latent defect so if you don't
see it today you might see it later and
coarser states the leak should be
immediately noticeable but they do
recommend sending the 1852 serial number
de marketed coolers back for recall so
to locate the lock code reference the
serial number on the packaging or on the
radiator would be where to find it
Corsair has pictures and instructions in
the forum post that's linked in our show
notes written by Eric Hamilton and the
description below all of the other lock
codes remain unaffected you've certainly
heard about the
by now but we'll cover it anyway because
we were visiting I believe Linus when
all this went down so tight right the
group that organizes Computex and is the
Taiwan External Trade Development
Council has announced that AMD CEO Lisa
Tsui will be hosting the pre-show
keynote speech ahead of Computex and
will be covering it although we may not
attend that you know in person will
certainly be in town and ready to cover
it remotely as often is the case these
are streams and it's easier to cover
them from the hotel room now sadly so I
Computex the quote here Computex as one
of the global leading technology trade
shows has continued to advance with the
times for more than 30 years this year
for the first time a keynote speech will
be held at the pre-show international
press conference dr. Lisa su received a
special invitation to share insights
about the next generation of
high-performance computing we look
forward to her participation attracting
more companies to participate in
Computex bringing the latest industry
insights and jointly sharing the
infinite possibilities of the technology
ecosystem on this global stage so it's
it's not 100 percent clear what Andy is
announcing at Computex clearly it's
something we already know this the
obvious choice is going to be the rise
in 3000 series products our
understanding from discussions at CES
off-record with vendors or at least
people we can't name with partners of
AMD was that there should be a June
launch and this would align with that
because it'll be late May early June
when this keynote happens
it looks like May 27th for one Comi
taxes starting this year and then we've
also heard that a lot of motherboards
should be exiting production around July
if not slightly before then depending on
which board it is how complex it is
things like that there's also been a lot
of discussion about when na'vi will make
an appearance and it could be that
there's a tech demo at Computex for
na'vi Rison 3000 looks like a firmer
launch or at least a an announcement for
launch that would be shortly thereafter
and Navia might be a bit further in the
future but we'll probably get some kind
of mention in the very least so we'll
keep an eye on it and we'll be at
Computex to cover anything major that
happens there or any partner models that
might show up if anyone slips this year
like they don't really do
and then finally or at least the last
two here at gigabyte has bundling a 9900
k with a Z 390 or ass extreme water
forest for a lot of money it's it's
$1600 and this is e 390 platform mind
you so here's what's happening gigabytes
got cherry-picked bin 299 hundred KS
with their $900 RS extreme water force
board and they're coupled together
that's becomes a really expensive CPU at
this point but and also the most
expensive Z 390 motherboard that we're
aware of
or at least gigabytes for sure so either
way it's an aorist extreme it's got a
water block these have been known for a
while now the difference is that the cpu
has been so the hand-picked 9900 K will
ship with a 5.1 gigahertz overclock with
the board and gigabyte assures that
would-be buyers that their motherboard
and BIOS have been dialed in to handle
the overclock now how much they've been
dialed in and if there's more than five
point one gigahertz out of that chip we
don't know hopefully so because 5.1 is
not all that exciting if you're paying
that much money for it so hopefully
there's some more room there but either
way it looks like the BIOS has been
pre-configured
so that you don't have to do any work is
that worth the amount of money no no
it's not but it's an option I guess so
the engineers have stressed tested the
boards at higher loads compared to the
standard according to the press release
and also the users can quote enjoy
extreme performance with all cores at
5.1 gigahertz or higher and excellent
stability so 1,600 bucks let us know if
you buy the combo I guess finally at
Roasters line of Sebastien's I was at
the lioness roasts if you're on
floatplane you've already seen it but
they will be publishing a version to
youtube as well and just wanted to
highlight that it was an interesting
event it was pretty fun very high
production quality it was actually kind
of insane the amount of work that the
LTTE and algae team put into this then
they actually had to bring in an
external production company so a
production company hired a production
company because that's how complex the
event got and it was the roast sponsored
by madrenas coffee because the
roast is enough for an ad as one of my
jokes it says in the in the roast itself
so anyway check it out if you want it's
on floatplane so if you're already on
there you can check it out we're not on
floatplane but I am happy to to give it
a shout because it was a fun event and a
very unique for the industry it's to my
knowledge the first youtuber roast
so hopefully you find it interesting and
they will be publishing a version of it
I think it's going to be in the next few
weeks to YouTube so keep an eye out for
that anyway that's it for this one thank
