Nexus tonight we are at Thermaltake
Suite here with witches across the hall
from TT eSports first a note all of our
CES 2015 coverage is brought to you by
cyber power for their cyber vapor gaming
PC so this is a new case in the core
series there are three of these they're
pretty similar just different in size
this is a full ATX there's a micro ATX
and a mini ITX as well and the case is
it's very wide it's basically an open
playground for modders so the only major
differences between them is going to be
as it scales down in size it scales down
and radiator support fan support and
hard drive support this supports seven
hard drives or you can put some SSDs in
there as well and two SSDs and sort of a
clever thing about it is on the
underside of the motherboard tray
there's support for two SSDs which is
similar to things like some of the NZXT
cases which mount SSDs on the backside
of the motherboard tray so that allows
you to hide it a bit better this is very
wide so it's it's worth noting pretty
immediately that the motherboard mounts
horizontally rather than vertically and
in spirit of this you're able to remove
or add rails as you see fit so if you've
got a modding project where you want to
eliminate the board and core components
and just turn it into basically a fish
tank like a liquid cooling setup to
funnel down to another stacked system
then you can do that by removing some of
the rails and dropping in liquid so
these are stacked vertically you can
stack in this instance two of them
they'll go more but you've got stability
concerns obviously it does come with
wheels it ships with a few wheels if you
want to roll it around in terms of the
rail and modularity system you can
basically plug and play as much as you
want it ships with one 200 millimeter
fan 140 millimeter fan other than that
we were told it fits anywhere from 14 15
16 fans so basically any kind of cooling
configuration you'd want to do if you
want to create a tornado that has no
cooling efficiency you could do that
radiator support for this actually fixes
the problem that Thermaltake created for
themselves a while back with the 540
millimeter radiator that we showed you
some years ago and the the 540 radiator
will mount vertically here if you've got
two of these cases stacked on top of
each other so you can remove some of
some of the hardware inside and install
that vertically right there other
radiator support I mean once you go 540
you can pretty much fit everything so I
will fit all the radiators we have a
separate video on thermal takes liquid
cooling solutions this year so be sure
to check that out so you can see what
they're making with this case in mind so
that is the core x9 the core x2 is a
smaller version of the x9 the x1 we've
got some b-roll for you and it's
basically a full ATX micro and mini they
are pretty wide so I wouldn't be able to
fit this in my computing space it might
be better for you that is something to
keep in mind
pricing for them is 180 I believe for
the x9 130 x2 and 100 for the x1 so
that's the case lineup for thermal take
check links the description below and I
will see you all next time peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
