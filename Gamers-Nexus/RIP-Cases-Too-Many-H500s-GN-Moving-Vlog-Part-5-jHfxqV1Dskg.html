new names
stop calling at age five hundred we're
doing inventory today so it's time to
start doing some actual moving of real
product over an inventory Reena
inventory basically every single thing
we have and it's very meticulous
basically we're gonna start with some of
the coolers and cases stuff that we
don't need immediately and also stuff
that we can learn the process on so
it'll be a mix of moving stuff over
figuring out what shelf it's gonna go on
so we're gonna label the shelving units
and then maybe the individual shelves
not sure yet and also take pictures of
everything
take serial numbers and note where it is
who's checked it out or if it's checked
in and all that stuff so we'll have a
really good inventory system going
forward that'll allow us to really track
where stuff is and it's also nice
because then if there are a lot of times
where I'm not sure if we have something
and I have to go spend 40 minutes
looking for it so now we just check a
spreadsheet and immediately identify it
we have it and where exactly it is and
if someone else is using it actively so
I'm gonna start with this huge over
overweight shelf of liquid cooler is
each one of these is filled with liquid
so it's pretty heavy shelf move some
cases however see if our system works
and if it does we'll go forward with the
rest of it before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly's
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal Grizzly's cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below
so I'm just handing cases down to
Andrews handling with Patrick and Keegan
Anika's and air-condition so it's like
100-plus degrees up here and all the
cases are hot metal as well it's too bad
I'm holding this camera and I can't help
you guys it looks like a lot of work
yeah too bad you got your yeah it's a
real unfortunate situation for me
so I've already cleared out all the VR
stuff which hasn't been touched in a
while so VR stuffs gone that was down
there peripherals are gone i snowflake
so please coming in to inspect our work
right now I think we're we're just gonna
make sure we don't get underway he's
pretty serious audit going on right now
so some other words back away just
pulling more out gt70 carbon then we're
gonna move all these over if the office
getting vit√≥ria back empty so those are
all test benches right now if they're in
deep fix my backup board for our
long-standing cooler test bench X 299
prime this one's broken
here's the box for the first ever test
bench GPU that I bought I think before
anyone was officially employed by me
this is the 7850 used it for our first
GP first test bench for the case testing
I think it may be some CPU testing but
kept it around because it was really
monumental step for us I'll do that here
for now so one more board and then we'll
put it all on the car oh there's that
entire shelf is empty sir it took years
to fill it up and less than two minutes
to empty it out and now we're gonna go
fill the new shells in the office so
there's your bittersweet empty and
unlike the testing corner we've been
using for years now I won't take long
get the rest of this out of here
oMG peas might take a while okay so
we're starting to take some stuff out of
the set room now pulled out a couple
motherboards and just kind of look in
here and realizing like how much stuff
there is in general and knowing that
this is like not even a quarter of our
date space so not just a lot of stuff
there not a lot of testing almost a lot
of history like this was out there now
we might actually have space to put it
up properly you see in the back corner
of the set before the tool and so they
will bridge it between the two sets or
something going forward and snowflake of
course very upset that this tempered
glass panel is not on a case where it
belongs so there's our play button this
the other one this is from one of my
earlier PC builds it's an i7 930
processor box we've got the processor
out ready for testing
and yeah I think I'm just I'm just gonna
pull stuff up this side of the shelf so
it doesn't interfere with their normal
testing and and then we'll figure out
the rest later there's a lot here okay
so now we have to move the expensive
cargo I don't have a great way to move
GPS so I'm just gonna take some of this
foam it's technically anti-static but
whatever it's a minor part of the
banking is I want to keep like the order
that they're on on these shells these
are the GP racks at EVGA gave us from
their storage they're like twenty years
old they gave them to us for organizing
so everything's in a specific order
right now like this was all Andy it was
to oldest I want to keep it that way so
I'm just pulling them off one by one and
moving them into this and there's our
first line of like the bigger cards
sitting on top of them so they're not
just their beef PCB components touching
the walls and then just gonna pack it in
really well and line it with four GPUs
basically so I think we have a think we
have about 20 cases in here right now
and there's a half ax and a phantom 820
I'm leaving behind because they won't be
retested for a while but also addicts
like 120 degrees and I didn't want to do
any more
take safety very seriously here at
cameras and axis so this is the gamers
Nexus case graveyard this is about 80 to
90 percent of the cases probably there's
Kelvin more at home mostly the really
big ones like there's another dark Bass
Pro 900 there's a half axis phantom 820
so there's a probably coming eventually
but now what we have to do is let's go
through with Patrick and figure out it
forget getting rid of any of these
before we start doing inventory on
everything I even know I mean they're
just like dark Bass Pro 900 303 Corsair
something oh yeah 275 are it's kind of a
dumb case
that's the H 500 and the X th 500 or the
Aged 200 200 H 401 of the small ones so
on a case is Raven are v02 p.m. o 1p 3 a
1 whatever this is and remember that one
is it fractal r6 that's r6 the Antec and
razor case that was awfully priced Leon
the air 11 air to ATX you got the India
there's a lot of cases so we're gonna go
through to figure out which ones stay in
which ones I find a new owner for and
then we also have a car full of liquid
coolers over here so how this cart has
been MVP lately
conditioning and just a lot of quarters
again not all of them but most of them
so now we're gonna do the fun part
sort through it start doing inventory
hopefully by the time we get done with
the cases we'll have a good idea figure
it out for what we're gonna do for
inventory then we can get more
complicated stuff so now now we're gonna
do the culling figure out which ones go
away Patrick does a lot of the case
reviews pretty much all of them at this
point so we're gonna we're gonna go
through here and figure out what we keep
Raven I think we keep this one yeah I
keep them Massa 575 are we can get rid
of the 375 are sorry of course there
yeah first first one to die this one I
like leave that as a maybe
yeah yeah we saw the infinity so 303 so
maybe this one will build the one of our
workstations in there so yeah so that
won't even take up shelf space so that's
an editing workstation like the sorting
yeah we should probably keep this is
tiny and just as it's sp3 is a nice
piece nice display system as it has been
you know one we can put a production
system in this good too
yes we have another another one at the
half yeah and Jack's he came first of
that design okay so we can do five
production systems minus one that we
have so for production systems we have
those two cases plus mine hundred at
home so we have three cases yeah so this
room for one more production case
so that one that one can be one of the
production systems or something what is
it what's that one age 500 yeah yeah put
it in the file okay let's make an H 505
so the storage room is starting to fill
in Wow a lot of the HECO is gone
actually probably because we're filled
with cases some of which have a sound
treatment in them anyway
filled up a little faster than we
expected even after getting rid of some
we should probably get rid of some more
eventually but maybe wait a bit until
after we move to figure out what's
getting retested for now are we pretty
in micro ATX mini ITX on this shelf
trying to keep like older stuff towards
the back like stuff that's closer to go
in a way or that were holding on to
because it was some kind of
revolutionary case and now I think a
solution is I'm just gonna knock out
this this shelf because I think we're
gonna run we're gonna have like more
cases than anything else after kind of
clearing out some of that house which
should have you should have seen some of
that footage by now it was clear that we
actually don't have like enough coolers
and motherboards to fill every single
other shelf so we're not actually gonna
need this one so just gonna knock it out
and I have another mid-tower case in
here it's pretty good and these shelves
can take the case wait so allegedly
based on what they say on the boxes so
we're good there oh there's not a shop
of cases with the takis sitting on top
of it so pretty dark in these corners
right now but you get the idea
you're still filling it in but this is
where we are right now there's our light
so Keegan's got the light so Intel
boards on one side and the boards on the
other side that's pretty useful that way
you kind of you know which processor
you're working with but you don't know
if board yet to just pick a side for the
processor types and then grab a board
open-loop components still need to be
category I think that pretty much wraps
this room oh yeah stuff that is pending
review so this shelf is
my favorite shelf because it means I'm
not gonna lose stuff that we should
review so anything in pending review
will go on that shelf why is that there
so this room is a good comparison for
like what that room used to sound like
it's there's a lot of echo and reverb in
here you talk quieter cuz there's like a
one or two second Rebecca it'll go down
though as we put stuff in it but anyway
we've got fantastic kind of temporarily
over here problem I have with this I
really want it on one of these shelves
like this I'm a little concerned about
the precise positioning and how other
stuff nearby and walls and obstructions
might impact air flow and testing so
that's a potential point of concern but
I've got it there for now a bench top
power supply power supply passing over
there so we have this is something
that's still getting set up stones gonna
come in here you'll see it earlier
earlier in the video I actually by now
we will have in the video we will have
set all this up for testing and he's
tasked with figuring out how to use it
all and what our power supply testing
methodology will be so that's his job
for the next week or so and he's gonna
document it very clearly for me and then
we'll start doing power supply testing
so that says that's basically all the
progress other than not worth showing
but the small parts shelf is starting to
get labeled and stuff is on there now
it's pretty good progress but I think
that wraps it for this day video we have
a couple of hints commands we have
blackout curtains coming in curtain rods
obviously and more foam having put the
foam up yet hopefully by now we've
gotten some actually good suggestions
from you all that don't involve putting
blankets in the ceiling but I think
that's most of it so will be will be
covered pretty much on every front once
we're all done thank you for watching as
always go to store now cameras and
access net to help support this move it
has become extremely expensive so you go
to store like Aaron accessed on net pick
up a mob mat like one of these back here
they are presently in stock will be out
within a week I think maybe something
seven
ten days we should be out of stock again
so get your order in soon if you want
one in this shipment otherwise all the
shirts like this one the graft logo sure
has been completely restocked so we have
these in stock and tri-blend and cotton
extremely comfortable and really
identifiable design for us with the
average one percent forty one percent
bars on the shirt design and then
patreon.com slash gamers axis for
behind-the-scenes videos thanks for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
