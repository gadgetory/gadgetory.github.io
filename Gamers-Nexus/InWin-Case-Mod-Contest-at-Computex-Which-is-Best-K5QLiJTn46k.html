in wins booth and we just did a factory
tour within win so if you're curious
about how some of these case mods are
about to be looking at we're made you
can see that in the in window factory
tour will reach shows on the machines
that were used so pretty cool stuff here
first of all before we get into this
stuff before getting to Bob Stewart's
mod and the others all this content
brought to you by msi on the new x99
abroad well II motherboards including
the x 99 titanium so let's jump into
this first off this is the mod from bob
stewart and rod rosenberg it is an in
1509 case and the mod was actually made
using a couple of machines first of all
there's these little chamfered edges in
here and these were made with file
strokes so manually doing a file stroke
there about 10 / chamfered edge and it's
four sheets of metal so they're cutting
cutting a few ways there's first all
this one sheet second sheet a third
sheet fourth cheat on the top and sides
and this was done using so the machines
in the inland factory that we saw
including the CNC machine there's some
bolts here these are aircraft grade
aluminum bolts they are pressed through
just typical hammer style so bashed in
there then the sword is pretty cool i
forget what type of wood this is I'm
sure Raj in comments if he wants to and
tell us but type of wood that he brought
with them there's a piece of metal
pressed through the wood pretty cool
they just drilled board out a hole
through the wood and put that in there
and then the metal was brought with them
from the US when they came to Taiwan to
use for this custom store that they made
there's a shield on the right side with
the in 130th anniversary sign so that's
the mod from PS ma just move on to the
next one alright so we're at the next
mod now these are all in 1509 so this is
the same chassis that was used in the BS
mods one this is made by the German team
Barton blast and Stefan blast who did a
lot of custom metal work on this a
pretty cool stuff you can see there's
this green plastic that's in here
underneath the metal plating I'm not
sure how thick this metal is but looks
pretty cool it has got the open loop
liquid cooling solution on the top and
that runs through the case of course
there's an anti 59 60 X in here as with
all the other case mods and a sous tough
series saber-tooth x 99
and then the GPU is a 980 TI and they've
got hyperx savages for the ssds so
that's the the german teens mod on the
back there's the in wind at 509 cut
paneling so this is actually pretty
close to the original 509 it's just got
a bunch of really cool metalwork and
plastics work stacks on top of it now
one thing this green plastic looks
really similar to some of the stuff we
saw in our inland factory tour so if you
want to see more stuff like this check
that in win and NZXT factory tour videos
out the next mod is from the australian
team so this one is pretty interesting
as well first of all there's an LCD
panel here in the front and that's got
just an mp4 playing on it it looks like
some bullets and before which matches
the theme of course the health pack over
here has what looks like game you I so
it's got your health and your armor on
it not sure I think that's an LCD as
well there's also on one of the side
panels and ammo vest looks like Kevlar
vest basically that's cut up and nailed
to the side panel and it's got the ammo
chain as well if you run out of bullets
need to pull one at a time off your vest
I guess and then for the rest of the mod
there's this sort of gold finish on all
the open loop liquid tubing these are
rigid tubes the reservoirs are mounted
here and then internally there's the
gold raft intel ssds so there's some
SSDs in there and then the rest of the
sort of gold and black finish tubing for
the liquid on the top this is actually a
remote control so this is I would
believe for controlling the fan speeds
it looks like the light brightness or
color and then the the lcds on the front
of the health pack over there top is an
ammo box and then just your standard
tactical flashlight I guess because why
not have a standard tactical flashlight
in your military themes mod so that's
everything we got for you from the in
wind booth at computex these are all 509
cases they are not on sale yet but we
know that they should be sub two hundred
dollars maybe 150 ish not final on that
yet though as always links in the
description below for more information
on computex coverage thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
