your purchase when you die and your
whole life flashes before your eyes how
much of it do you want to not have been
rate raised what what the fuck is this
is this satire Patrick is this satire
before that this video is brought to you
by Lian Lee's at LAN Cole one case the
land coal one uses a mix of aluminium
and steel to create a unique front bezel
design that still manages to allow air
through at the artistically cut panel
fan mounting options are everywhere in
the case and ease of installation
features that make the case trivial for
building a system the land coal one is
competitively priced while still being
constructed with high quality materials
and a sturdy chassis learn more at the
link in the description below I'm being
told it's not satire so this is from
Tom's Hardware the editor in chief the
new one for now anyway of Tom's Hardware
the editor-in-chief published an article
called just buy it about the nvidia RT X
GPUs look we're not saying they're not
worth buying we actually don't know
that's kind of the whole point
no one's tested them yet but this entire
article is complete lunacy it actually
seems insane like delusional like the
rantings of someone who's just gone so
far off the rails I can't even tell if
I've been had I don't know if they got
me with this satire that's how crazy it
is so today we're gonna be talking about
quotes like like when you die do you
want your life to not have been rate
raised that's what we're doing today so
this is the new article from Tom's
Hardware let's just get one thing out of
the way immediately generally speaking
we don't recommend pre-ordering new GPUs
or CPUs or things like that it does not
mean that we think they're bad it means
that we just think you should probably
wait and see how they do and if it makes
sense for your use case and the other
thing here is this is like this is Tom's
response as in Tom's hardware's response
to the internet being a little unsure
about the price of the new NVIDIA GPUs
which is fine that's completely fair but
the response is a little crazy so let's
go through with things here line by line
new technology gets cheaper if you wait
long enough if you weigh
long enough it's not new technology
anymore that's the whole point of
waiting and it not being new so we're
off to a bad start here after but this
whole article contradicts itself
constantly they also said I don't know
this one's pretty good the 15 inch Apple
Studio display one of the first flat
panel monitors cost two thousand dollars
when it came out in 98 today you can get
a used one on eBay for under $50 or a
new 24 inch monitor for under 150 but if
you bought one at the time you had the
opportunity to use a fantastic new
technology when others didn't what like
what's the argument that I is though is
it is this argument seriously the thing
that YouTube comments are post on our
videos is the whole argument really just
like first first I was the first one to
use it that's the argument that's what
he's saying he's saying just buy it
literally just buy it in quotes in the
title because you can be first and that
therefore makes you better another one
here if if you can take another one so
inevitably when a game-changing
component or device hits the market many
will urge you to stay away until prices
drop or a new standard gets wider
adoption yes I would say that is
accurate but there's more that's why
this week so many users including our
own Derek Forrest and author at Toms
Hardware are advising shoppers to hold
off on buying one of Nvidia's new r-tx
graphics cards however what these price
panicked pundits wait this is just wait
just did you just diss your own employee
price panicked pundit Derek Forrest who
said you should wait to buy the cards
because presumably this person is
reasonable I haven't met Derek but given
that his employer is calling him
panicked and insulting him in an article
I'm willing to take his side on this one
went further to say what these price
panicked pundits like my own employee
don't understand because they're idiots
this is all the the parts that are in in
brackets he didn't
it's kind of implied what they don't
understand is that there's value in
being and early adopter and there's a
cost to either delay in your purchase or
getting an older generation product so
you can save money I repeat that and
just kind of truncate in the middle
there's a cost to saving money the more
GPUs you buy the more money you save
that's right the more GPUs you buy the
more money you save that is not how
money works it is it is there are
there's one instance where money works
that way and it's not this one so
there's a cost to delay in your purchase
the only time that this makes sense is
if you live and die by ray tracing maybe
you're a developer and you really want
to get ahead of the curve or maybe
you're Pixar you render things that are
a trace and you could actually use this
to speed up the processing so that your
movies get done faster then there is an
opportunity cost to delay in your
purchase if you are 90% of the people
reading this article and you want to
play games sometimes then no not buying
something doesn't cost you money that's
kind of how it works that's the whole
point of not buying the thing is that in
fact it does not have a cost as
evidenced by the latter half of this
sentence that says you can save money
again contradicting yourself so this is
the same kind of mentality where you
walk into a department store see a bunch
of stuff you don't need for sale in the
impulse purchase aisle and go
I can save so much money by buying all
this stuff unless they are literally
giving you money to take those things
you're not saving or making any money in
this transaction or perhaps if you were
to use it for a business application as
indicated previously but that's not
really who this article was targeted at
so opportunity cost here doesn't quite
apply if you want to play video games
like Avram the editor-in-chief of Tom's
here seems to based on the I don't know
do you want to
your whole life without seeing a race
race game comment then I would say yes
actually you can save money by waiting a
little bit and also just just a quick
aside here isn't it kind of weird that a
publication which gets because it
reviews stuff so people know if they
should buy it or not and saying actually
just you know it just cut us completely
out of the equation oh that's they're
trying to help us Tom's is trying to
help us they're trying to help us put
them out of business by saying cut us
out of the equation just buy the stuff
you don't need third parties like us
what do we know anyway and you know what
Tom's actually I based on this article
would probably agree with you and I'm so
sorry to all of the author's at Tom's
who actually know what they're talking
about so uh next one here while we don't
have final benchmark results just just
stop man just just stop what are you
doing the new features and enhanced
performance of the Turing cards make
them worth by now even at sky-high
prices okay
what happened Tom what have you become
look at yourself I'm using Tom as an
all-inclusive term here for anyone who
works at Tom's Hardware the business
model again of review media is that
people wait for your validation to see
if they should buy the thing so a bit
odd you're telling everyone again to
skip you and go straight to the product
page and just to reiterate here we're
not saying that the Nvidia RTX cards
aren't worth buying we're also not
saying they are worth buying because we
don't know just like Tom's Hardware
doesn't know kind of need to have it in
hand and start testing it to know the
answer to that so this isn't about
Nvidia it's not about invidious prices
it's not about r-tx even it's about the
insanity of this content piece next one
you could buy the last generation GTX
1080i for as little as five hundred
twenty six dollars but if you do you
won't be able to take advantage of T RT
X features like real time ray tracing
and great 4k gaming performance until
your next upgrade first of all the 1080
TI
does 4k just fine thank you very much so
that is incorrect secondly you can't
take advantage of it anyway because
those games don't exist yet so sure some
will eventually exist with r-tx or
ray-tracing features or whatever but
most people buy in a 1080 Ti are
probably aware that it is in fact not a
20 80 TI so that doesn't make it bad at
Tom's own suggested price of 526 dollars
that's actually a great purchase so I I
don't know I don't really quite get what
this means in fact Andrew behind the
camera and I tried to understand this
paragraph for quite a few minutes and we
couldn't come up with anything so very
very confusing at that price actually
the 1080 TI is a great deal so next
point so the next one next line in here
unless you plan to upgrade your GPU
every year you're going to be stuck with
technology that looks much more outdated
in 2019 and 2020 then it doesn't when T
18 that is again accurate it also
probably 2021 and 2022 and generally as
things age they get older the next part
of this yes there are only 11 announced
games that support rate raising and only
16 that support DL SS but there will be
a lot more in the months and years ahead
do you want to put yourself behind the
curve again is this is this satire I
don't I genuinely don't understand the
statement it sounds like he's saying
unless you're going to do this thing
that's crazy like upgrade your GPU every
year you'll have outdated technology so
Patrick I need your help so the question
is what's the point that he is trying to
convey but isn't he already he's arguing
for upgrading your GPU every year yes
he's saying if you bought a 1080 TI a
year ago you should buy a 20 80 because
that'll be the one that's good for the
next 10 years
yes except you should also upgrade it
next year because you're upgrading every
year and the games with rageface and
won't be
until months and years ahead this is
actually this means next one the next
statement in here at Nvidia's conference
CEO Jensen Hahn describes it real-time
ray-tracing as the quote holy grail of
graphical computing while that statement
might be hyperbole so we've we've
established that he's not self aware
okay next what this weekend Vidya showed
a demo of battlefield 5 where you can
see a muzzle flash from another part of
the world reflected in a soldier's eyes
and the fire from an explosion reflected
off of the glossy finish of a car that's
what you'd see if you were actually
there participating in the fight and
you'd also see the world in high
resolution not just 1080p you'd also not
see the world in pixels so or 4k for
that matter not really sure that the 4k
Fame is quite what we see the world then
it's just like real life you know like
how the soldiers feet slide across the
ground when the animations break or when
their necks become 16 feet long or other
real life things like clipping through
walls and guns clipping through walls
and smoke clipping through the floor and
fire that moves at a lower frame rate
than the rest of the game and fire that
is lower resolution than the rest of the
game and sprites that are used in the
game it's so realistic this fire that I
can count the pixels as it's clipping
through the objects that's how realistic
it is so a few things here one that's
wrong there's still visually inaccurate
representations in this game even though
it looks pretty good especially because
it's not fully ray traced it's not
literally real you do know that right
Avram like it's it's not it's not
actually real life secondly you'd
probably if you were there participating
in the fight you would probably be
focused on shooting the bad guy or
running and hiding not staring into his
eyes thinking how beautiful they are
with the fire in the muzzle flash in
them so not really and by the way that's
how it would be in the game
let's be honest here game looks pretty
good but when you're playing battlefield
and you see a bad guy in front of you
you or even a teammate doesn't matter
it's battlefield
you're probably gonna just try and throw
c4 on him or another vehicle and blow it
up not stare into the character's eyes
and think about how beautiful it is and
that this is the entire reason you
bought the graphics card
so according next quote here according
to Nvidia's I own numbers the r-tx 20/80
delivers between 35 and 125 percent
better performance on 4k games than the
GTX 1080 the r-tx 20 80 delivers between
35 and 125 percent better performance
you know somewhere between zero and
infinity it's out there somewhere I see
there it's either not better or whoa
it's really good so that's a there's the
Tom's Harbor performance analysis
somewhere between zero and really really
good
that's the improvement you're looking
for when you're among the first to
purchase a new architecture like in
videos our TX cards you take the risk
that the technology won't work as well
as advertised right away that you won't
find a ton of titles that support its
special features and that the price will
drop making you feel like you wasted
your money yes I am with you just so far
however oh well you pay a premium for
cutting-edge components you're also
buying time timing to enjoy experiences
what what does that mean buying time to
enjoy experiences that buy your own
sentence preceding this one don't exist
yet I don't what does that like
seriously sit down read the article read
that paragraph and here's here's a fun
audience participation everyone post a
comment below on your interpretation of
this it's kind of like when you go to a
shrink and they show you a bunch of ink
blots and ask you what it means that's
what this is it's actually a
psychological test to see how you
and if you need help like this guy might
next one this is my favorite - life is
short
how many months or years do you want to
wait to enjoy a new experience you can
sit around twiddling your thumbs hoping
that an RT x 2080 gets cheaper or you
can enter the world of ray tracing and
high-speed 4k gaming today and never
look back when you die and your whole
life flashes before your eyes how much
of it do you want to not have ray
tracing first of all big assumption that
I'm going to die secondly how much of it
do you want to not have ray tracing
looks looks pretty ray traced to me I
don't know C seems like just about
everything is ray traced so that was a
weird sentence especially the part where
it's it's like it's like I don't know an
English 101 paper where they're trying
to sound like something's really
important and they're about to come to
this critical understanding of something
and it's it's what the papers been
building up to except it doesn't make
any sense
next last few parts here however if you
think the cards are going to drop
significantly in price at any time soon
you are going to be disappointed there
are several good reasons why the RT X
cards cost so much more than their
predecessors there are good reasons that
a Nissan GTR is a hundred grand but
coming back to the title of the article
that does not in fact mean I should just
buy it there are so many other things to
consider then whether or not the sum of
the components warrants the price and
also we don't know if it does yet that's
that's kind of the whole thing
last last two second video card
companies know that people are willing
to pay a premium price for RTX cards if
you look on Amazon new Aggron video
store you'll see that many of them are
already sold out there's no lack of
demands demand while accurate the
argument that everyone else is doing it
so you should - it's really not a very
good argument and finally I
well finally that I could take anyway if
you can possibly afford one of the r-tx
cards even if it's not the most
expensive model there's plenty of
reasons to pull the trigger now the time
you spend waiting and complaining about
it being overpriced
is time you could be gaming with the
most realistic user experience available
actually no it's not because you'd be
buying it on pre-order and so the time
you they're not mutually exclusive you
can both pre-order something and
complete in fact you can even play games
and complain about what you paid for
them so once again nonsensical sentence
or a collection of words in the disguise
of a sentence and also not buying the
most expensive model we don't know where
the 27t lands in the stack of
performance it could be the case that
it's not as good as a 1080 TI in games
that don't use ray tracing we don't know
so this whole thing the whole the whole
article I I'm gonna save you the time
you've seen everything there is to see
and I am very sorry for bringing this to
your attention and I apologize for the
aneurysm that you're going to have
because you probably also don't
understand what many of the conflicting
sentences actually amount to so tom's
hardware thank you very much for the
content peace it was a lot of fun I hope
to do it again sometime keep it up great
job and for everyone else subscribe for
