IMAX
tr4 lick tech cooler today matched up
against the 240 millimeter variant with
a special appearance from Noctua and the
Nhu 14s air cooler our previous enter
max 240 millimeter lake tech benchmark
gave an understanding for where
full-coverage liquid performs when
compared to full coverage air and when
compared to these smaller A's attack
plates now we're expanding to look at
how much radiator size impacts at 4
gigahertz 1.35 v core for a thread
ripper 1950 X CPU before that this video
is brought to you by thermal Grizzly
makers of the conductor not liquid metal
that we recently used to drop 20 degrees
off of our coffee leak temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo knot and hydronaut pastes
learn more at the link below this one
will be pretty quick our original
version of this coverage covered the 240
millimeter animatics cooler versus the
Noctua air cooler and the NZXT crack
next to which is a smaller coverage
coldplay ace attack unit and that unit
is pretty expensive and pretty high-end
it just didn't work very well on thread
river because the cold blade size
actually matters a lot so revisiting
that today the main focus here is to
look at the 240 versus 360 millimetre
coolers from ni max to determine if
after we've accounted for full coverage
plates
if the radiator size makes a meaningful
difference with this particular cooler
the NH u 14s tr4 if you can find it in
stock should be about $80 the enter max
Licht X 240 cooler should be about $130
and the 360 unit right here with 3 120
millimeter fans should be about $150
these are all US prices checked at the
time of making the video so that's what
we're looking at for price is a $20
difference between 240 and 360 part of
this testing will focus on noise
normalization where we lower down to 40
DB a fan speeds and then see how they
perform at a fixed 40 decibel output the
most important aspect here is that while
a larger radiator may not afford
gains in peak performance depend on what
it is the radiator will afford better
performance when you drop the noise
levels further the threshold between
where the temperatures are no longer
safe is going to be a lower noise level
for a 360 in it then for a 240 so keep
that in mind as well and of course
liquid is going to be objectively
superior in identical test conditions
with identical coolers it just is but
the argument comes down to whether it
makes sense for the user whether the
price makes sense whether the the
installation or the application of the
cooler makes sense in the particular
build that it's being used for so keep
that in mind for you or use case as we
go through the numbers as always testing
methodology will be defined in the
article in the description below so
check that out if you're curious how we
tested we are using delta T over ambient
values here so this is a temperature
readout over ambient that means that you
can have numbers below ambient in terms
of the reading but that's because it's a
delta so we're starting out with a focus
on the NR max units the NM attics 240
millimeter CLC with a prime95 workload
at 100% keeps the CPU at about 50 point
seven degrees Celsius over ambient and
it has an idle temperature of about four
point six degrees Celsius over ambient
the 360 millimeter version of the
animatics CLC which adds one fan and
also uses full-coverage cold plates
operates at forty six point six degrees
Celsius and keeps an idle about four
point two idle is within margins but the
average core temperature under load has
reduced approximately four degrees
Celsius from the 240 millimeter unit at
$150 for the 360 an 134 the 240 unit
you're paying about an extra 10 dollars
per two degrees Celsius if you look at
it that way this is more something
that's done for absolute peak
performance or potentially lower noise
and normalize thermal so we'll see that
soon the Noctua nhe 14s maintains
impressively competitive performance at
9 degrees warmer than the CLC 240 but as
12 point four degrees warmer than the
360 millimetre unit still for most
people the NH e 14 house is going to be
perfectly fine it just comes down to
what you're doing with your CPU how far
you're pushing it what kind of power is
going through it and things like that
still using prime95 but normal eye
in the fans needs to equate a 40 decibel
noise level where the Nhu 14s already
sits the tr4 360 now runs 4 degrees
warmer at 50.1 degrees Celsius and the
TR 240 unit runs also about 4 degrees
warmer from its previous full-speed
baseline at fifty four point eight
degrees Celsius the delta remains about
the same between the coolers as
previously as well and this also gets
the liquid coolers closer to the Noctua
cooler in performance because we're
slowing them down and lowering the noise
level theoretically this does mean that
you could further lower noise floor from
our 40 dB a readout like to 34 to 36 for
instance and stay below the threshold at
which the 240 would need a speed bump at
360 wouldn't that's the main way to
realize an advantage here if that's
something that's important to you back
to 100% speeds now using blender blender
puts our enter max units at forty two
point three degrees sausage for the 240
millimeter units and thirty nine degrees
Celsius for the 360 the knocked WA n hu
14s runs about forty nine point three
degrees or ten see warmer than the 360
millimeter animatics unit which was
about twice the price of the Knox with
cooler weather that's worth it is
entirely up to you the X 62 as
demonstrated in previous content runs at
comparatively awful performance given
its price this is due to the limited
contact area of the cold blade something
that both knocked WA and enter max
resolved with TR for specific cold
blades and coolers limiting ourselves to
40 DBA the blender test has our enter
max 360 millimeter unit at forty one
point six degrees Celsius with a 240
millimeter unit running a six to seven
degree warmer temperature at forty seven
point nine degrees the Nhu 14s operates
at 49 degrees showing again the value of
Knox was optimization for what equates a
forty DBA output that said enter Max is
objectively superior in terms of thermal
performance with the three hundred sixty
millimeter unit and that primarily means
that you could run still lower rpms on
the animatics unit well beyond where the
other coolers would enter dangerous
territory it's just a matter of whether
that price bump is worthwhile as the Nhu
14s is now at around eighty dollars a
significant
advantage finally here's the full noise
charge this show is a lot of coolers
that you wouldn't want to use or
couldn't use on thread Ripper basically
everything we've tested from LGA 1150
thousand eleven onward and includes the
animatics coolers at their Maddox rpm
along with the NIU 14s which will
highlight all of those so strictly
looking at the 240 in the 360 there's
not a big difference if you were already
committed to buying one of these liquid
coolers and you're just wondering what
the difference is between them for
radiator size it comes down to an hour
testing overclocked at about four
degrees for most the tests and then you
could leverage that extra performance
Delta with a 360 to drop its fan speeds
still lower if that's not something you
typically do or plan to do there's
really not any value in it unless I mean
there's not even a size value because
it's bigger so and still 120 millimeter
fans so the 240 is plenty fine and isn't
that much worse than the 360 price
difference is 20 bucks so it's not that
big of a jump either but still ten
dollars per two degrees more or less is
what you had a pain and that's not gonna
gain you anything it's not gonna get you
better overclocking it's not gonna get
you anything extra at all really except
for lower noise if you manually tune it
so that's how to look at these numbers
the Knoxville unit is $80 so quite a bit
cheaper it's hard to find in stock right
now but if you can find it at $80 it is
it's a really impressive performer when
compared to the liquid coolers it's
still nine degrees warmer and some tests
on the two forty twelve degrees warmer
than the 360 in the same test but the
thing you have to look at is where does
that get you in terms of thermal
performance and we're still not really
close to throttle territory with the air
cooler at that performance level so
there are reasons to buy each and they
primarily come down to what case are you
using do you need the top graphics card
slot because some of the motherboards
with the aqua cooler won't necessarily
support the top slot but
also thread Ripper has a million PCIe
lanes so does that even matter besides
it looks unless you have multiple cards
those are the things to consider for
liquid coolers obviously they are liquid
coolers so technically it has a fill
port
generally speaking the cooler will
outlive the usable life of the system
anyway but if you're extremely concerned
about uptime then air is probably the
better way to go that said if you are
worried about permeation you can refill
this it's really more for their RMA
Department than for you but you can make
use of it so yeah plenty good for all
three of these coolers the only one that
we would definitely not recommend
actually two that we definitely not
recommend would be the 120 millimeter
nautical cooler which is just insanely
far behind the 140 just by the 144 10
extra dollars is so much better and the
ex 62 which represents all ASA tech
coolers there's not that good on thread
Ripper because the cold plate contact
area is very small so that's it for this
time as always you know patreon.com
slash gamers Nexus I was that directly
or stored out gamers nexus net to people
shirt like this one or our new stickers
which we finally got in so we need to
slap it on to the x-box turn it on and
watch it melt off because the xbox hits
really high idle temperatures as you can
see in our previous video or one of them
thank you for watching as always I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
