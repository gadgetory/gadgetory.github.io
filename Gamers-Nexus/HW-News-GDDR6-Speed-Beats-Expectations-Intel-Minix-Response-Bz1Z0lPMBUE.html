hardware news recap for the last week
this time we have information on the
Intel MINIX OS implementation also
talking about the photos of the Andy and
Intel MCM integration along with the
Samsung GDD are six memory progress
we'll call it and video has quarterly
results coroner's got a new world's
fastest kit and thermal tank has a chair
that blows air at your butt
so that's what this week before getting
to that this coverage is brought to you
by EVGA and NVIDIA with the destiny to
1080 Ti bundle a 1080i SC to comes with
a synchronous fan control for its dual
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below
Cyril tank has their new ex comfort
chair x4 extreme and its extreme comfort
because it plugs into the wall and it's
not what you think it's not RGB LEDs no
in fact it is for fans that are inside
of the butt cushion housing I guess for
the chair so these four fans for first
of all let's talk about presentation
here so they're all takes image
promoting this chair shows hot air
entering the fans and coming out into
the the rear end region as cold air now
generally speaking that's not really how
air works it doesn't it doesn't enter
hot and then enter into the case cold
for example shower works in the case
it's not how it works with a chair
either so what that image would actually
depict is that it blasts your butt with
hot air um it unless it has a
refrigerating unit inside of it or
something but either way it's got four
fans in it and it moves there and those
fans if you weren't already worried
enough about them it's been at 5100 rpm
at the high end 5100 rpm is faster than
a Vega reference cooler which is like 70
decibels of noise let's hit that
at 4900 rpm now to be fair the
Thermaltake fans are larger so they
won't be as loud but there are also four
of them but then to be fair again
they're embedded inside of a cushion and
if you didn't believe that the chair
actually works let's take a look at the
thermal image from the marketing
materials first of all what's with the
scale look at that scale it's 24 degrees
Celsius
to 28 degrees Celsius so we've got a
really small scale which exaggerated the
differences and here's the best part
look at dark blue the hottest dark blue
temperature is 25 point five and the
coldest bright red temperature which of
course looks bad is twenty six point
five we have a difference of one degree
Celsius and yellow occupy something like
that maybe 26 the twenty six point three
so what's with the scale thermaltake
come on and please yeah the chair itself
that if you look at it we've got some
basically temperature values when people
sat in it versus okay okay it's not the
most scientific test but either way
we've got thermal images for it I guess
and those thermal images mostly show 0.5
degrees Celsius differences also the
chair plugs into the wall and has wheels
so just kind of leave that there so yeah
well that's that's what chairs have come
to now if there's really no
differentiation and two tooth or whole
takes credit the chairs now are all from
the same supplier so HyperX and
verdaguer and Corsair and Thermaltake
and basically you name it they all at
least have some parts from the same
supplier so they're not that different
and what you end up with is things like
this or things like the whatever company
previously did an RGB LED chair so yeah
other than that it's got the four
dimensional armrest which means that
they move four directions and so does
every other game in chair on the market
and it's got a 331 pound weight limit
and I guess the extra fans could be used
to make it a hover chair if you're a
lighter or something that chair by there
will cost $500 and the only thing we're
looking for next so they're all saying
taking ideas here my suggestion to
improve the product would be consider so
you've already thought about something
that gamers need which is cooling and
now consider the next option which is an
integrated septic tank that would be my
suggestion to you you can have that one
for free
Thanks topic also gaming chairs OFM
enters the gaming chair market with the
aptly titled I guess respawn series
because we need to make sure it sounds
gamer to sell the gamers so this is a
North Carolina based company it's called
OFM and they're entering the already
crowded and obviously desperate to
differentiate gaming chair market with
their new respawn line that starts at
$140 so it's it's not the the Paramount
$500 for fan chair but it's more of a
normal chair eight models in total
different colors features specifications
and the low end models 140 the high end
is 225 they're worth looking at I guess
but it's all it's all chairs that's how
they are they do now a few years ago it
was all peripherals and now it's all
chairs we reported on the Intel AMD
collaboration about a week ago where the
two companies are working on a multi
chip module or MCM that features eighth
generation Intel Core CPUs the H Series
CPUs along with discrete and the
graphics rumors have since indicated
that it's a potential Polaris graphics
chip in there not Vega which from a
competitive standpoint would mean Andy
could stay a generation ahead so that
makes some sense and that's not been
confirmed though so holdout on that one
what has been more or less confirmed
though is what the package looks like in
its present state and this is a pretty
clear actual photo of the thing not like
a faked leak or anything so this photo
was posted on beyond 3d it shows the
package which hosts the Intel CPU and
the GPU and HBM all on a single
substrate the Intel component will still
include its IGP despite the AMD GPU
inclusion and the idea is that the IGP
will be used to take over for lower load
video playback and
decode tasks things like that whereas
the AMD GP will be used for actual
compute processing and video workloads
that requires some power so the result
is the IGP is power savings when you're
not using the GPU and it is basically d
GPU it's not integrated into the CPU and
then you have the power savings
otherwise so that's really the only
advancement it's the new photo on beyond
3d as for other Intel news Intel using
MINIX has been pretty big over the past
few weeks and there have been a couple
of developments on it so to recap this
for anyone who's missed it last week saw
the reveal that Intel uses a negative
rein so it's rein negative 3 for its
management engine and that's where
exists a lightweight OS that was built
by Andrew Tannenbaum who is an educator
on operating systems and this MINIX OS
was initially released under the
berkeley license so although MINIX
wasn't intended for use in cpus or pc
h's or really any product outside of
educational scenarios it's also not
illegal to use medics in a corporate
setting or in a product the license
permits freedom to use and modify the
code without compensation or technically
without any meaningful attribution so
then we fast forward from the berkeley
license release of MINIX in 2002 today
and what we have is that intel has
deployed the OS on a negative rein and
all of its CPUs and skylake running on a
CPU core when you've enabled it to do so
and related to this more news emerges of
possible exploits via physical access
like with a USB device where you can
gain access to a system through this
lower-level OS so it's a possible
security concern as well so that catches
everyone up but it's not today's news it
does give back story though today's news
is that Tannenbaum released a public
letter to Intel again the creator of
MINIX is Tannenbaum and he noted that
although he doesn't seek compensation it
quote would have been nice if Intel let
him know that MINIX was basically the
world's most used OS on x86 CPUs now
Tannenbaum had previously answered
questions from Intel about reducing the
memory footprint of MINIX but wasn't
told the context of those questions he
had assumed that it was some sort of
Ethernet or graphics chip development
Tenenbaums letter added a note post
publication stating that quote I think
creating George Orwell's 1984 is an
extremely bad idea even if Orwell is off
by about 30 years people should have
complete control over their computers
not Intel and not the government
Tannenbaum also stated that quote
putting a possible spy in every computer
is a terrible development
well links to sources for the full
letter and the article links below in
the description but that's kind of where
we stand right now still waiting to see
if Intel has a response and still
waiting to see the implications of all
of this but basically Tannenbaum is the
new development he's actually spoken and
has a pretty reasonably sized letter
that addresses all this it's an
interesting read so check that out next
news item is Samson and GDD are six
allegedly hitting 16 Giga transfers per
second which is beyond the initial
projections and targets Samsung has
already collected a CES Innovation Award
for its GDD are six memory which seems
to be turning out better than expected
originally Samsung stated that their GDD
our six target would offer at throughput
of fourteen gigabits per second however
the memory appears to already be heading
through bits of 16 gigabits per second
that's much higher than both gddr5 and
5x which launched at 10 but has bumped
up to 11 gigabits per second moreover
the memory subsystem should operate at
one point three five volts compared to
the one point five volts it currently
takes to drive gddr5 X we don't yet know
about the timings of the memory which
are a major player in performance for
all of these gd-r types of memory at
lower matched clocks to GG dr v g5 x
performs significantly worse in gaming
tasks when consider an entire memory
latency it makes up for this with the
frequency bump the frequency largely
makes up for this in Pascal but latency
will remain a question for D gr 6 so
we'll have more information about that
probably at CES Nvidia posted its
financial results for its third fiscal
quarter marking a 32 percent climb
year-over-year in revenue at 2.6 4
billion dollars
up from two billion and video noted
growth an AI and data center also noting
gaming and automotive technologies as
growing sectors where for automotive the
Drive px Pegasus was announced as an
autonomous taxi solution Nvidia also
noted adoption by cloud computing Giants
of the volta V 100 GPU the role of PC
hardware releases isn't that much
different from the world of posting a
comment on YouTube things like first
often come up regularly or fastest or
best or any other superlative you can
name for the most part Corsair is the
latest to employ superlatives in their
marketing materials Corsair has
announced what they call the world's
fastest 4 by 8 gigabyte ddr4 memory kit
and this is a 32 gigabyte total kit
which they have claimed is 43 33
megahertz the new Vengeance lpx kits use
Samsung ICS and eight layer PCBs with
the easily recognizable heat spreaders
affixed to those timings come in at CL
19 - 26 26 46 at one point 3 5 volts and
availability is listed as December 2017
with no current word on pricing though
that seems to be in flux as always last
news item EK WB is expanding their cool
stream s eseries
with 420 milliliter and 560 millimeters
slim radiators so EK has two new options
for the cool stream se lineup and they
have 0 overhand brass cores and use a 22
GPU fin density with standard G
quarter-inch ports the cool stream se
420 will go for $90 and the bigger five
sixty millimeter variant will go for
$110 so that's it for this week in
