Nexus tonight and we are here at zou tax
booth at PAX Prime 2014 it is day 2
right now I am looking at the new Pecos
e box it is a very tiny phone size
system it's basically a it's called the
pi3 20 which I originally thought it was
a Raspberry Pi derivative but it is not
it is actually running on Bay Trail a
Bay Trail Intel CPU which is a BGA CPU
meaning it's soldered to the board you
can't use or service it but it is a 1.3
3 gigahertz quad-core stock and a turbo
boost up to 1.8 3 gigahertz and that is
the CPU for RAM we have 2 gigabytes of
stock memory clocked in at 1600
megahertz which is ideal because for an
integrated graphics solution you're
dependent upon the system memory you
don't have any on card Ram so having
1600 megahertz or better it's pretty
important ideally you want something
like 1866 but this is a tiny system so
you're not gonna be doing any gaming
that's that intensive anyway in terms of
other specs it has 32 gigabytes of
soldered onboard flash memory it is emmc
memory and it's got a micro SD slot that
is SDHC SDXC and all the other SD
derivatives that will be expandable up
to 128 gigabytes so that's your storage
capacity in terms of networking
it has bluetooth 4.0 and wireless 802
dot 11 n so it's not AC quite yet maybe
in the future but right now it's 802 dot
11 n for use case scenarios the the
reason these are kind of becoming a
thing now is because of all the
streaming you look at Nvidia's game
stream you look at the grid system with
Amazon and maybe Time Warner in the
future and what that's doing is creating
gaming on demand similar to movies on
demand you buy from your provider and
then it streams to the system and you
don't actually do any of the graphics
processing locally so you don't need a
high end GPU locally you just need a
system to plug into a visa mount or
something on the back of your TV just
like this is here so that's kind of the
use case scenario it's mostly intended
for business users right now but does
have consumer uses in the future because
of grid and it's applications MSRP is
$200 or $1.99
and again the pi3 20 look out for it
next month we should have a review
online so be sure to stay tuned for the
reviews and all that information and we
will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
