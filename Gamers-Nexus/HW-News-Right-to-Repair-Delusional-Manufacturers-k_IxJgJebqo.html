the past week or so in the world of
hardware and the industry surrounding it
so the news topics for today include
fair repair bills which is a us-centric
thing but something that all of you
should pay attention to if you are not
located in the US as well we've got some
info on SSD manufacturer market share
ddr5 preliminary plans an Intel Xeon
processor or series of them and then
some Intel opt in and news on destiny
too so starting off a fair repair is one
I wanted to bring up just kind of as a
side mention it's not a new product or
anything like that but it's an important
issue and this is something we have an
article on the website for already
written by Eric Hamilton it's pretty
good article and covers everything but
just to bring everyone in the video
audience up to speed basically in a few
states right now there are some bills
that have been introduced to protect
consumer rights to repair open modify
products as needed so that might include
your phone or your game console where
let's take only like a PlayStation or
switch or any of those devices if you
have a maybe a failure in the fan or
something like that you want to open it
up and replace it you should probably be
protected in your rights to do that
after all you purchased the product so
really who cares what you do is it at
that point unfortunately it's not quite
that easy so fair repair bills in the
states they're in right now there there
are a couple in there's one in Nebraska
in Minnesota in New York Massachusetts
and Kansas that's where they're making
some ground right now but the
Entertainment Software Association of
the ESA which is composed of Sony
Microsoft Nintendo and companies
externally like Apple and game
developers and publishers really this
group and external groups are opposing
these laws or these pieces of
legislation that would protect your
rights to repair your devices so there's
something needs to be a bit be paying
attention to especially if you are in
our core audience we're something like a
teardown might interest you because the
your ability to do one of those
changes based on how these laws go
through
so these console makers and Apple
included and Microsoft included Sony all
of them live in sort of a delusional
fantasy land where I'll give you a quote
from Apple
so Apple told lawmakers in Nebraska
about a fair repair bill which again
basically says you own the consumer
electronics devices you buy and you can
open them and do whatever you want
that's that's up to you as an as a buyer
of the product Apple told lawmakers in
Nebraska that a fair repair bill would
turn Nebraska into a quote mecca for
hackers
so that's haha
some scary language for the politicians
who maybe don't know anything about this
stuff an apple just by the way deploys
measures in their devices to
deliberately break them if you try to
get in there and fix something and you
are not authorized to do so and we have
more info on that in our article linked
below and we'll probably be talking
about this quite a bit in the coming
months another thing here cybersecurity
is the guys for all this so when these
manufacturers tell lawmakers this bills
bad here's why the here's why normally
starts with cyber security so it sounds
very very important and scary and and so
that of course is a reason to not open
your device but ultimately the goal of
these vendors is to make sure that you
don't own your device you can't fix your
own device and that you basically lease
it this phone this laptop this console
is extended to you on an effective lease
so you have no right to modify it or fix
it or whatever this is a problem on a
few levels one of them is it fuels a buy
and replace culture which contributes to
a massive a waste problem we have with
rare earth metals and things like that
that's really going to be a big problem
in the future but also it's just
pointless and stupid and waste money for
the consumer when you can fix something
as trivial as maybe a battery
replacement a screen replacement a fan
replacement anything like that their own
tastes thermal pads that trivial stuff
too
in a laptop or consumer electronics but
this doesn't give you any protections to
do so another kind of weird thing in
here warranty void of removed stickers
we kind of talked about this quite a few
times like with the Trident review the
amous I tried and that had a warranty
void of remove sticker I believe hiding
a screw and that thing is supposed to be
user serviceable but you can't do that
with a warranty void if removed sticker
on it apparently because you are
apparently at risk avoid in your
warranty now how enforceable that is
debatable but the the intent there
they're mixed messages you know clean
and sustained your own device but do so
without opening it
so get working on that quantum computer
building I guess anyway I'll kind of sum
this one up Eric had a great quote in
his article where he said quote the
right to repair is not an entitlement or
an attack on the profitability of
innovative companies is an integral part
of a free-market taking an iphone to an
Apple Store for repair only to have the
screws changed to effectively lock its
owner out is tantamount to having a
mechanic at an automotive shop weld your
hood shut and slap a warranty void if
remove sticker along the scenes so that
pretty much sums it up but his articles
down there the description if you want
to read it and you haven't already we
had some other coverage of the ISP and
privacy stuff in the last week as well
might be talking about that today though
in less political news and horror
industry news the market share for SSD
manufacturers was was relayed to us by
some third-party firms and as the steam
market shared distribution for the year
of 2016 which is of course all we have
data for right now the newest data shows
that Intel's at about thirty percent of
the market share Samsung twenty one
percent and Kingston at sixteen percent
those of the top three vendors everyone
else by these numbers is below about
seven percent at or below seven percent
so there's big disparity there between
the top three and then everyone else
which would include companies like a
data Toshiba ie ocz at all and so the
the interesting thing here Intel is sort
of a first part
in this market Samson is basically a
first-party in this market they do after
I'll make everything that goes into the
drive Kingston is more of a third party
they don't make their own modules the
flash module they buy it from other
people and they don't make the
controllers so they have about 16
percent hauled on market chair for SSD
is not bad and then everyone else is
below that
SanDisk is a popular brand for some of
our readers at least last year was and
they hold that 7% if you are curious
SSDs overall are growing as a market and
in popularity you can go on Amazon now
scroll through SSDs especially nem two
form factor and see a whole bunch of
brands you've probably never heard of I
get emails almost on a monthly basis
from companies that I've never heard of
in the industry who are making m2 SSD is
because you source the parts you put
them together on a PCB and you sell it
as a product so that shows that this is
a rapidly growing market it's not like
hard drives where really there's two
main vendors in our space maybe three
and and the distribution is kind of
spinning down so another industry news
item here ddr5 got some attention today
at least day of filming where it was
basically jeddak announced that they
have an intent to finalize the spec for
ddr5 in 2018 probably to no one's
surprise it is supposed to be faster and
denser it's kind of what happens with
these these iterations but specifically
jeddak was targeting a 2x improvement in
bandwidth and about a dublin and density
and lower power consumption or more
efficiency overall so the story we've
heard before this is not something that
will be out anytime soon
you won't need to worry about your amp
or or Z 270 or whatever platform being
obsolete at any time in the immediate
future but ddr3 has been going for about
10 years now and several years ago when
ddr4 was kind of starting to hit the
consumer market with x99 or it was next
time was that excited I'd whatever
enthusiasts chip said it was at a time
when ddr4 started to hit the consumer
market we were predicting somewhere
around a 2016 mass adoption point for
ddr4 it looks like we're mostly on the
mark looks like about 2017 2016 is when
that's finally happened so ddr4 is the
thin now ddr3 lasted about ten years
still plenty fine if you have it
ddr4 we would suspect should be alive
for quite a while longer but DDR 5 is in
the works and the spec should be
finalized next year at which point some
of these vendors might start looking
into how they're going to work with it
on another memory topic just really
quickly here Intel octane memory was
discussed at the beginning of the week
we have a separate video and article on
that if you're curious some motherboard
vendors gigabyte included it comes to
mind have started pushing BIOS updates
that will support obtain officially so
the plants that support obtain have
begun we're still waiting on review
samples and for the final review date to
lift though
and then in affordable Server processor
news the Intel Xeon Series is getting a
refresh with a cable a set of Zeon's the
e3 1200 v6 series is the one that they
have sort of announced in the past week
and given some specifications for this
is in the the e3 1280 it's sort of
supposed to be an entry-level business
server processor is something that a
small business would by the shove in a
corner to handle all of their accounting
databases or whatever they may be doing
so it's not necessarily a consumer part
however the Zeon's worth paying
attention to because a lot of the time
you can grab one of those parts as a
consumer and put some pretty good put it
to pretty good use even for gaming
systems especially as the older ones
start showing up on eBay and places like
that because businesses tend to not hold
on to these things forever and they're
not necessarily abused part so the e3
1200 v6 is the family coming out at the
e3 1280 v6 and so on that we've got
specifications for you today that is a
three point three nine gigahertz of base
clock and it boosts up to four point two
with turbo boost and other than that
typical ECC support of course being a
server processor supports ECC up to 64
gigabytes at 2400 megahertz and it does
have an Intel p6 30 HD graphics chip
embedded but it's
it's an embedded graphics chip so
nothing too exciting on that front
it is a processor to look out for though
not something I would expect much of our
audience Devine but we'll see how Intel
pushes is the online in the near future
because rise in the r7 CPUs and rise in
server counterparts should shake up some
of the high-end desktop market
potentially some of the server market
we'll see so that probably has Intel at
least doing some level of scrambling and
hopefully to change up h EDT parts in
the future so final two things here
destiny 2 was announced and normally
that's not relevant but this one's
coming to PC so that's interesting for
us because it's looking like a good game
for benchmarking and optimization guides
and things like that which of course
interests us on the content creation
side it's supposed to come out September
8th there will be a beta in the summer I
believe as far as I understand that's
going to be a pre-purchase access beta
which we're not big fans of really but
hopefully it opens up at some level ps4
and Xbox one are supported and there are
a couple cool voice actors in there
nathan fillion included so it's a game
to look out for final announcement here
is on the GN side so we've got probably
sometime this week will be officially
posting a merch store this feeds into
our patreon stuff so we've got a couple
shirts like this one is the kind of cool
grab shirt right now with the 1% in
average bars and all that and then the
standard GN logo shirts with the front
and back
iconography so we'll be hosting that up
on a store I'll have a URL for you
shortly
and then patreon backers I've probably
reached out to you if you haven't
already received the shirt I have likely
sent you a message so check your inboxes
and we'll get these sent out to you as
always thank you for watching
patreon.com/scishow nice and stuff that
directly links below for more
information subscribe for more I'll see
you all next time
