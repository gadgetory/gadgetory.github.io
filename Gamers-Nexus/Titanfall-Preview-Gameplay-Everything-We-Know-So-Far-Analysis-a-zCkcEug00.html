Donna and I am joined by page Dino
pillow Spears hi everyone and today
we're talking about titanfall which is
the upcoming FPS mech game this is this
video as you have seen it's called
everything we know about titanfall so
far so it has quite high expectations
hit the link in the description below
for the full article that covers more of
it in detail so titanfall again it is an
FPS mech game it is due out March 11
2014 and we know that you can play on
foot as a pilot or in a mech and we'll
talk about that more in a moment I want
to spoil quickly that I do have some
pretty cool technical details of course
our site is technical oriented and those
will be toward the end of the video so
we'll be talking about the native
resolutions on xbox and how its
upscaling versus the resolution on PC
which is the the texture resolution so
we will get into that as far as the
premise of the game page what do we what
are we looking at so the cool thing
about what responded with titanfall is
that they focused entirely on making a
multiplayer orange again rather than
building a campaign mode that either
players don't play or get through to
matter hours there is some story line
involved with the multiplayer how that
kind of plays out has yet to be seen so
you're either the IMC or the militia
when you're playing game types games are
6v6 each player has the ability to call
in a Titan each team gets 12 minions
which is there what they're calling
their a is there's different forms of
minions some are smarter than others but
basically the game at any point time can
be up to 24 verse 24 right we're not too
sure you have the AI plays out but when
we know that you can hijack them with a
data knife which is kind of interesting
for game mode what we do know is that we
have a hard point domination came mode
which is one thing and then we have
attrition I think that the the funny
part is that it's it's hard point
domination but I know get hard point as
a king of the hill game type from black
ops 2 and I know domination also from
call of duty which is interesting
because respawn is made up of people who
were previously a part of infinity ward
right like jason west and vince zampella
who they they left Infinity Ward kind of
in a heated battle I think a couple
years ago which of course pissed off
Activision so they are the ones working
on on titanfall and this is the first
game that they're making as respawn
entertainment so I think we're going to
get a lot of those element
of call of duty that they've probably
taken over with them from infinity ward
they do have the hardpoint domination
game type 15 minutes long goes to 400
points same thing you've got a point B
point c point you capture those specific
points you are areas in the you earn
points for your team and attrition is
like a team deathmatch the game types
ten minutes long goes to 250 kills which
I thought was an insane number but
considering the amount of minions that
you have the ability to kill the pilots
you have the ability to kill and the
Titans you have the ability to kill it
makes sense in both game types you can't
call in a Titan until four minutes in
once four minutes hit that's usually
when all the Titans Facebook Halden oh
I'm sure later on in the the game it'll
players will stagger when they call in
Titans and stuff but for now it's mostly
just oh my god Titans yes and then once
your Titan is destroyed or doomed it's
another two minutes before you have a
Titan available as a pilot when you die
you have the ability to instantly
respawn but you also the ability to
spawn in as your Titan if your Titans
ready to be built and the countdown does
persist through death so it's not like
you have to stay alive the entire time
the game types obviously pretty
important the maps are also very
important and we know that titanfall is
far more vertical base than most other
games like Call of Duty is pretty pretty
flat and horizontal so this this kind of
gives the developers away or the level
designers a way to fake bigness will
call it of the level they can make it
appear much larger than it is because
there are a lot of static objects in the
background there's static buildings
there's no procedural damage to them
because Paige and I were kind of talking
about it earlier I think if you could
destroy the buildings in this as much as
I would like that because Titans should
be able to it would make the level feel
flat almost instant it would be pretty
horrible if as you were fighting it as a
Titan you were also destroying the
entire map as you went as a player you
can actually get on buildings that are
taller than the Titans Titans are 24
feet tall but when you've got buildings
that are three four stories high you
actually have the ability to shoot a
Titan from a rooftop and then back up
far enough that they can't see you
tactical advantage yeah Titans can't
jump they can only dash right and the
maps we know so far our are called
fracture there's one called Lagoon and
then there's angel city fracture is a
fuel depot lagoon is as we know it a run
down town it's we don't really know too
much about it yet then Angel City is the
one we've seen a lot of and that's a
metropolis basically that's that's in
chaos yeah Angel City is definitely a
very close quarters map lots of corners
lots of Ali's definitely haves buildings
you can get on top of buildings you can
get in really cool to see the park
boring abilities on that map yep parkour
of course we haven't actually mentioned
yet until now so as a pilot you can
execute basic parkour very similar to
mirrors edge you can do wall runs or
there's like a jet pack so you have the
ability to wall run a wall hang when
you're creating your pilot loadout a bit
too different is additional perks to add
on to your pilot one of which is an
enhanced parkour kit which means that
you can actually wall run for longer and
Walt hang for longer yeah that does sort
of allow the pilots to get on top of the
buildings and take out Titans from a bit
more of an advantage we know there are
three types of titans right now there's
the Atlas the ogre and the Strider as
far as we know at a top level the
Striders kind of quicker so you pretty
much have your Atlas which is your
standard well-rounded tighten your auger
which is your less mobile but takes
heavier damage and then the Strider
which is more mobile but can't take
heavy damage so it really just depends
on what loadout you give the titan so
you get your pilot loadout and then you
get your titan loadout titan loadouts
you get a primary weapon a tactical
ability an ordinance and you get a kit
where you again get to pick tube /
loadouts we know of so far obviously you
have your standard weapons new rifle
shotgun we have a pistol or side arm and
no that's a different pistol it depress
it's the smart pistol it's not a sidearm
I don't know if you've seen any gameplay
from the smart pistol it's it literally
just finds to the people targets them
and all you have to do is hit the
trigger and it kills them I don't what
kind of thing is that why i don't know
cuz we can they made a pistol that like
hones in on targets like guns they could
do it so we've got an am Bob pistol we
had a shotgun which is an auto shotty we
have a rifle and SMG and what is
effectively a sniper rifle although as I
as I understand it age long ago yeah
sniper but what I could gather about the
list I per rifle which I already wrote
an article about how you can't quick
scope or no scope in this game like you
can in most modern first
shooters which I know greatly saddened
me as a person but apparently this gun
shoots more like a DMR which is a
designated marksman rifle more than it
shoots like a sniper rifle we also have
anti Titan weapons so a kind of
reminiscent of Unreal Tournament
basically it's an it's an auto shotty
accepts a rocket launcher so it's rapid
fire rocket launcher and then we also
have no hold on the rapid fire rocket
launcher has a 25 round magazine this is
important to know if you want to stay a
bit farther away there's the archer
heavy rocket the only bad thing about
the archer is that it is a homing rocket
so it does need time to walk on if a
Titan sees you in five seconds chances
are you are going to be walsall at her
yes there are standard pistol side arms
that are different from the smart so
pretty standard pistols then we have
tactical abilities we have cloaking
which we'll start with and then we have
a stim pack starting with cloaking
obviously it makes you invisible to
Titans and minions but as I understand
it it's not quite as good against human
pilots assuming is kind of how the cloak
is gonna work in this game where you can
kind of tell when a players invisible if
they're moving but if they're still it's
gonna be a little bit harder the stim
pack boost movement speed and health say
you've got your parkour abilities and
then you've got the extra park or a kid
and then you've got the stim pack packed
basically you can run from any situation
you could possibly need to write and and
then we've got ordinances so we have a
standard like a chi frag grenade and an
arc grenade which is it's basically it's
an EMP type thing when when it explodes
it's kind of like your mini-map goes
away your killfeed kind of gets all
messed up all that but yeah if we've
also got KITT there's a Power Cell that
allows recharging of those abilities we
just talked about a little bit faster we
have explosive packs a shield battery to
kind of let your shield time which is
normally 30 seconds it lets your
titanfall initial shield dome last
longer and then we have minyan detectors
and we have the enhanced parkour kit
that we already spoke about moving into
the Titan weapon Titans get one big gun
and then they have other abilities and
kits just like the pilots do so for the
bigger guns we have a 40 millimeter
cannon that uses high explosive round as
we have an arc
that does lightning arcs between the
enemies a chain gun which is just an 80
round machine gun or mini gun and then
we've got quad rockets just shoots four
rockets and ax and a Titan rocket
launcher so we really know about one
tactical ability for the Titan and
that's called the vortex shield it's
where you r ab the enemy projectiles is
they're coming towards you and then you
shoot the back ordinances we know of one
so far that's the rocket salvo it
launches an unguided Rockets warm so
they just kind of go what is that so
idea how many hand gestures I've made
this if you're getting in trouble though
there's also an eject feature so in core
gameplay you can eject from your your
Titan and kind of launch super high into
the air which is interesting because you
can try to land on the opposing Titan if
there is one there's also an auto eject
in the kit which kicks you out
automatically when the Titan is doomed
there's there's also a nuclear ejection
when the Titan is dying it will explode
and damage those around it there's also
a regen booster to regenerate the shield
a bit faster and a survivor kit to
mitigate the damage that the Titan is
taking so that's sort of what we know
about the Titan weapons and the player
weapons in terms of some of the
technical stuff for the Xbox it is
likely that the game will natively run
at 720p or 900p I don't think it's going
to be 1080 and that's because the
developers are targeting a 60 FPS they
want a constant 60 FPS and the consoles
are obviously more limited than pcs in
that regard so it will be lower
resolution and then upscaled which might
be noticeable on on higher quality TVs
or monitors but otherwise should be fine
for the PC it'll run natively at
whatever resolution you tell it's are on
at because that's how pcs work then
there's there's been some criticism
online about textures as seen in leaked
footage we can't show any of that here
but the textures generally have been
kind of a a lower resolution that has
disappointed some people i did go do
some research online and respawn has
officially stated that the textures seen
in that leaked footage are actually 25
percent of their final size if you have
a 256 by 256 texture in the Alpha it's
actually 512 by 512 because doubling the
square quadruples the tactical account
so that was done for distribution
reasons because otherwise that the Alpha
file would be too big so don't worry too
much about that page and I
I can kind of about the the physics in
the game there aren't a whole lot of
soft body physics everything's kind of
rigid body based so you don't really
have any procedural destruction and that
is again for gameplay reasons to keep
the maps feeling large you can in fact
crush people I mean is that you have two
people are pretty crush-worthy me excuse
me I mean pilot so we know that the
physics are pretty limited it looks like
the animations or that the deaths are
all animation based I haven't really
seen any evidence of rag doll death so
that made disappoint some people but
that is going back to respawn
entertainment focusing super heavily on
gameplay and mechanics so that sort of
concludes most of our titanfall coverage
I know there's been some interest in
competitive gameplay also we will add a
paragraph in the link in the description
below for the article to speculate on
competitive information page any final
anything you really want to I usually
said that we forgot to talk about how
odd ball would be a really fun game type
in this game let's let's talk about so
why would vol fun can't I could you
imagine if like you could only play
oddball with the Titans so it's
literally the Titans are the ones
carrying the oddball around rather than
the pilots cuz like who would you
imagine like these like insane crossmap
throws was tighten to tighten how fun
would that be that would just remind me
of the days where you have the two jocks
throwing a football do anything about a
giant game of monkey once again everyone
