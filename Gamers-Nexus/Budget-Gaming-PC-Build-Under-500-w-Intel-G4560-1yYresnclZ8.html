g 4560 cpu including follow-up coverage
on best GPU pairings with the g4 560 we
decided to assemble a gaming pc around
the budget intel chip this follows our
previous pc build which featured an r5
1600 x for mid-range cost today it takes
a less metered approach we're staying
below $500 closer to 450 to 480 and
leveraging only Hardware in our lab to
do it
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by ifixit.com and the pc
essentials toolkit which can be had for
$20 making it one of their cheapest yet
most complete toolkits use code gamers
nexus for $5 off to bring that to 15 you
can go to ifixit.com a lot of scammers
nexus or click the link below for more
information
as usual with our pc builds that one of
my requirements for our team Eric and
Patrick worked on this was these only
parts that we had here so no ordering
stuff and we have a couple of
suggestions in this content where we
would make changes where we to order
something that way you can benefit from
those changes but this gives us a solid
base lines work from do some FPS tests
power draws has to show that no you do
not even need a 500 watt PSU but the
price was good on new ID anyway so we
can establish all that with what we have
here we've done thermals noise power and
fps of course and that tells us exactly
how all the parts are performing where
we can improve them if you were to build
your own and the goal of the build was
to assemble a cheap gaming machine using
Intel's new pentium part which seems to
somewhat invalidates almost the i3
territory chips now there are some key
differences in AVX support and things
like that but as far as gaming goes a G
45 60 does pretty damn well and is right
in the territory where the i3 is
previously have been so that makes it a
good candidate for a cheap gaming PC and
so we seized on the drum and these rise
in line in this price category it's a
little ways out still and we've also
paired for now a gtx 1050 with a build a
few things here we looked at 10:50 tea
is they're appealing there were a couple
that were $120 but the sales were still
hit
miss sometimes v1 20 sometimes w140 at
140 the price was just a little too high
and entering into 570 territory or
exiting 560 territory where didn't make
a whole lot of sense but a 1050 is
consistently eighty to a hundred dollars
depending on sales and that was a good
pairing so we'll go through all those
numbers and some of the other options
from the 1050 Ti and the 570 you can see
all that an hour when does the g4 560
CPU bottleneck benchmarks that contains
all those numbers if you're curious how
much more you can get out of the
performance with a better GPU overall
not counting rebates we're looking at a
price of roughly four hundred seventy
dollars though if you count the rebate
to Falls closer to 450 but we all know
how reliable those are this build uses a
gigabyte b250 hd3 motherboard which is
one of the immediate things that you
could cut down to lower the cost
something we'll talk about more later
it's also got the MSI ten to the OC card
at 100 or 80 after rebate if you count
those and then we're using a HyperX fury
20 400 megahertz memory at 8 gigabytes
of course $68 eb j is 500 watt power
supply is also routinely on sale for 20
to 30 bucks enough to be reliable it was
technically about $50 MSRP the corsair
spec oh for enclosures what we're using
for the case as it's the lowest cost
case we have right now we just reviewed
it so we know exactly what its strengths
and weaknesses are and it still retains
some level of quality in the $50 class
the drive is a simple one terabyte WD
blue 7200 rpm disc and if you had money
couldn't spring for an SSD but for
something ultra budget this makes sense
and so again we set the bar with our PC
build by doing actual benchmarks of
thermal power noise and gaming rather
than just assembling the list on new AG
or whatever incline it today that is why
we require the parts here these are all
things we've worked with and that to
some level we either trust a good amount
or we trust with caveats that we've
explained in all the reviews so that you
know what to look out for that's why we
use these parts because we know them and
can recommend them as a complete unit
that's been fully tested here so let's
start with the FPS benchmarks to keep
things easy and then we'll roll
to power temperatures and noise the goal
for gaming performance in such an
inexpensive PC was roughly 60 FPS at
medium to high settings starting at the
low end of the spectrum it Sniper Elite
4 on high which is somewhat ambitious we
had only forty 4.7 FPS average despite
excellent optimization on behalf of the
game however this is a game that relies
so heavily on the GPU and as
demonstrated in our g4 560 bottlenecking
article there is a somewhat significant
performance uplift by using a 1050 TI we
can actually show that benchmark briefly
here to show where the other GPUs land
with this PC build there is no
stuttering though and medium settings
raised the average near enough to our 60
FPS goal that we could call it good that
said sniper tends to perform better on
cost cost and the hardware given its
optimization focus for AMD Hardware
right now so this is the only game you
want to play or maybe doom is included
in that and be worth considering an rx
560 instead the more demanding Ghost
Recon wildlands however it's still at
the low end of the spectrum remain just
below 50 FPS average at medium settings
while GTA 5 tested with a mix of very
high-end ultra graphics had a higher
average with comparable lows pts
performance is impressive here and
dropping a few settings from ultra the
high would permit frame rates north of
60 FPS average pretty consistently and
just keep in mind that the type of
hardware we're running on is pretty
cheap considering that this is what's
capable of 60 FPS now with pretty damn
high graphics settings in GTA that's not
anything to be ashamed of Total War
fared better again nearly at a 60 FPS
average but with less drastic dips this
is with high settings so you could drop
the medium and be in pretty good shape
if you're not happy with this and then
overwatch at the maximum possible
settings it performed roughly the same
but consistently high frame rates are
much more important in competitive
gaming for that reason we followed our
own overwatch graphics optimization
guide raised the average FPS to 87 from
following that guide and increased the
zero blow on tumblr to a more manageable
51 this shows us that dropping settings
a bit will print frame rates greater
than 60 FPS though overwatch and other
eSports type
hold on well with the higher quality
settings and with overwatch anyway you
can lower things that you'll never
really notice anyway even though the FPS
impact is noticeable for power testing
as measured at the wall we're measuring
an idle total system power consumption
at around 30 watts with multi-threaded
blender rendering at 54 watts GPU
blender rendering at 82 watts total
system drops that gives us a look at CPU
and GPU total utilization and then
overwatch gaming was around 115 Watts
draw you can easily drop down to a 422
450 watt power supply for this build and
still have some power budget overhead
but it's tough to find good PS using the
400 watt range that aren't complete
garbage or aren't overpriced for the
wattage they exist but the value tends
to be better at this 500 watt market
borrowing some of our brand-new case
testing methodology that made its debut
I'm a spec o for a 3d marked stress test
burnin puts a realistic gaming load
level on the CPU and GPU jointly rather
than using our normal torture testing
this establishes a CPU load temperature
of 2048 Salty's delta T / ambience and a
GPU load temperature of 40 4.6 l vs TT /
ambient this means that considering
ambient temperature our GPU is an arien
v70 celsius point we're completely fine
on both components despite running a
stock CPU cooler and a low-end video
card cooler
neither the cpu nor the GPU produce much
heat here and adding an $8 case fan
would be beneficial to keeping the CPU
and GPU cooler speeds lower which would
help in noise reduction
speaking of noise for noise testing our
tests were performed with the single
case fan at max speed and we left the
GPU fan to adjust itself automatically
unless otherwise noted
we knew that Intel stock C vehicle would
be loud and so inconsistent in its speed
and past tests with Emma size 1050 and
engine TT IOC models have shown them to
be prone to buzzing at higher fan RPMs
so we weren't expecting much here that
said at idle the system reaches a
noticeable but surprisingly tolerable 38
DBA it's not silent by any means and any
activity at all causes the CPU fan to
audibly ramp up but headphone users
shouldn't have any problems just for
reference the noise floor here is about
26 DBA the chosen components require
very little cooling and noise levels
could easily be reduced by purchasing a
real CPU cooler
with a larger fan but Intel stock
heatsink is completely adequate and free
loading the cpu with blender and the GPU
with a 3d mark stress test in two
additional tests barely affected the
noise levels as the G 45 60s at low
temperatures combined with gigabytes
default CPU fan curve kept the fan from
rising too much an hour PM manually
tuning fan speed to 100% revealed just
how bad things can get if they were to
get bad and I was 44.9 DBA sounds more
like a vacuum cleaner than a PC at that
point but you could still tolerate it
with headphones and if you are
particularly ignorant to noise because
you'd rather not spend a whole bunch of
money to reduce it again the reason we
feel comfortable keeping a noise or
cooler installed is because the 4560
will rarely reach temperatures that
require those higher fan speeds so again
the extra fan would help reduce cooling
rpm modulation so we're pretty happy
with the performance overall again off
the shelf parts from here it's
performing pretty well you could drive
down cost a little bit more so there's
an easy $20 saving to the motherboard we
have an HD 3 in here it's ap-250 board
ATX it's a gigabyte board that runs
close to $90 which 4g 45 60 isn't really
necessary now it does give you some
upgrade a headroom if you wanted to pull
that chip later and put something better
in there but because it's not a Z SKU
you're not really going to get the full
potential out of a real upgrade to a
case Q anyway because you're going to be
launched for overclocking so there's
it's a point of diminishing returns
where you can either go full zsq and
enable yourself for the upgrade later or
commit to what is more likely reality
for most of us and just buy a cheaper
board stick with the 4560 until you're
ready for a complete full system build
so the options there may be an asrock B
250m pro 4 that's a micro ATX
motherboard we don't have but it's a bit
cheaper so you say about 20 bucks there
if you really were desperate for the 20
bucks
this board is good it's probably better
in a few ways but again $20 not
necessarily needed another option would
be from gigabyte the be 250 a micro ATX
version of the ds3 H similar to this
board but micro ATX
another 20 bucks off or for cases you
can go down to something like a 200 are
for about 40 bucks right now as of today
the equals tesseract plenty of other
cases viy pc the not I said not even not
necessarily they are not the highest
quality cases neither is this to be fair
but it's a bit better than some of those
but again you're looking at how much how
much you want to spend to get a little
bit better quality when you already at
the low-end budget
scale to begin with personally my
philosophy is if spending an extra $10
will make me happier for the however
long I will have the system then I'll do
it but that's just my way of doing
things
especially in the case Department
because you're going to be staring at it
for the whole time you have the system
so overall not a bad build performs well
you can do 60 FPS gaming on it with
medium ish settings and a lot of the
more intensive games or you can get away
with high in a couple of them overwatch
is a good example you can basically do
alter there and the same is true for GTA
5 without advanced graphics settings so
pretty damn good overall impressive
considering where the industry was a few
years ago and as long as you're at 1080p
you're in good shape with a setup
similar to this
of course many improvements can be made
we've given you a couple of suggestions
but stay tuned subscribe for more
because there always be more PC build so
patreon are complex game is access to
helps that directly or just subscribe
because we'll have tons of compy tech
stuff this coming week to watch that
helps us even more than other options
thank you for watching we'll see you all
next time
