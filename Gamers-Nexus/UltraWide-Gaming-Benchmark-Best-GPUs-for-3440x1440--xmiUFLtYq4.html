tremendously in popularity over the past
year and it's for good reason they're 21
by 9 aspect ratio allows more peripheral
vision and immersion for games that
support it and not all do and we decided
to benchmark GPU performance on one of
the high-end ultra wide displays at 34
40 by 1440 so not 1440p which is 2560 by
1440 but a bit higher resolution still
than that we deployed our mid to high
end GPUs for this test from Nvidia
that's the gtx 960 and up 4 gigabytes
and from AMD that's the r9 285 and up
which is a bit dated now but comparable
to the 380 and above that we have the
380 X resolution was set to 34 40 by
1440 on the Acer predator ultra wide
which is a 34 inch curved g-sync enabled
display but we had g-sync disabled for
all tests as were several other game
graphics technologies that may have
benefited one manufacturer or the other
and you can check our test methodology
links in the description below for more
information on that
well reviewing the monitor separately in
a future video and it is among the best
I've used but today's focus is on FPS
benchmarks at 34 40 by 1440 resolution
some ultra whites run lower resolutions
like 2560 by 1080 but we're going for
the proper tests on the high end here
the pixel count of our 34 40 by 1440
resolution display is 4.9 million to
provide some perspective though that's a
pretty fair gain there would be 2
million pixel count of 1080p or 1920 x
1080 pixels and 1440 which is 2560 x
1440 runs 3.7 million pixels so the 34
40 by 1440 is actually higher than 1440p
and that means that anything you can't
run at 1440p definitely can't run on
this 21 by 9 1440 resolution without
some serious tweaks in the game settings
or ini files today's test featured dirt
rally shadow of mordor call of duty
black ops 3 GTA 5 and fallout 4 we've
got a couple other titles too like The
Witcher 3 not all of them are in this
video but whatever's not is in the
description below in the article with
all the charts as usual some games are
not yet supported on ultra whites and
some may never be because of competitive
reasons so these games like dirty bomb
which is one
kind of a new game that's not complete
and - it is competitive do not
necessarily support ultra wide displays
like 34 40 by 14 14 that's either
competitive or just any developers not
supporting it so do keep that in mind
all the games we tested for this
benchmark are properly supported for
ultra wide resolutions except shadow of
mordor which is a bit odd because it
slightly stretches the character and
it's I think it's 33 60 by 1440
definitely an odd resolution but that's
the only outlier here all the rest are
the full native resolution first up is
dirt rally which fits the ultra wide
bill exceedingly well the resolution is
fully supported and added screen space
does increase viewable terrain corners
and neighboring vehicles all
advantageous to immersion or just
keeping tabs on the race dirt rally is
generally playable above 30fps you get a
good enough experience though we'd like
to target 40 to 45 for a smoother gaming
experience obviously 60 is still that
sort of magic number for fluidity but it
isn't at all required in this type of
game unlike a competitive fps in dirt
rally anything above the r9 380 X and
including the 380 X is generally
playable in this chart the 1% and 0.1%
load dips on the GTX 960 are bad enough
that this resolution with ultra settings
is fairly unplayable but you could dip
the settings down to medium or even a
mix of medium and high to make the gtx
960 playable with the ultra wide
resolution in dirt rally as for ultra
settings though the gtx 980ti
outperforms the 980 by 22.3% which then
outperforms the 390 x by 0.9 percent but
the GTX 980 s low frame times are
significantly more tightly timed than
the r9 390x which falls near 30fps for
0.1% low the GTX 970 is outperformed by
the r9 390x by 8.7 1% the game is fairly
playable on even mid-range cards if
dropping settings below ultra the 2
gigabyte r9 285 has the worst 0.1% frame
times to the point that the frame drops
become noticeable during gameplay it's a
bit of a stutter this is partly a VRAM
limitation with the high resolutions but
mostly a processing limitation of the
older 285 black ops 3 is the type of
game where you really want those higher
frame rates to best compete and luckily
it's also the best optimized title on
the entire bench though VRAM is a bit of
a different question sli performance is
actually worthwhile for black ops one of
the rare occasions that is the case and
it nearly doubles single GPU performance
in this instance 1% and 0.1% low frame
times also spike hard with SLI and
that's another rare occurrence so
everything's very tightly timed with SLI
in this configuration
everything from the GTX 970 and up is
capable of hitting 60fps averages or
above with high settings at this
resolution
jumping to extra is a bit more abusive
on the GPU particularly vram and that's
something we've discussed previously in
our black ops 3 graphics optimization
guide we search for that you'll find our
video talking about why that happens the
980ti outperforms the 390 X by 13.3%
the 390x outperforms the 980 again
that's the 980 by five point three
percent which outperforms the 970 by
eleven point five nine percent the 390x
often trades blows with the 970 and 980
but it really depends heavily on
optimization and resolution and AMD can
pull ahead a bit at high resolutions
given the architectures ability to
process raw raw pixel throughput a bit
more efficiently GTA 5 at Ultra shows
the SLI configuration as the only
solution to frame times greater than 60
FPS though it's not necessarily a good
value
AMD however seems to have severe frame
drop issues with GTA 5 on its newest
driver update something that will soon
be talking to the company about these
are bad enough that you'll see a hard
stop in gameplay for a split second not
long but enough to interrupt play this
is a specific issue with GTA 5 and is
visible not just to the ultra wide
resolutions but other resolutions as
well
the nihti is somewhat playable but let's
move down the high settings before
having a better look on high settings
across the board everything from the r9
380 X and up would generally be playable
but the 0.1% frame times are pretty
awful right now for AMD on the GTA 5
benchmark that pushes us into 970
territory currently with the current
drivers and that is pretty well student
for play at this graphics quality
The Witcher 3 is easily one of the best
looking games of 2015 and it hasn't aged
a year and it's one year since launch at
Ultra the games a bit abusive on GPUs
but reasonably playable on a 980ti keep
in mind that we had hair works
completely disabled during these tests
and it used SSAO instead of HB AO both
which are Nvidia Advantage technologies
dropping a few runs down to medium
allows better playability with anything
from a 970 and up being fairly smooth
the 970 is beaten out though by the 390
X and the 390 X does suffer from worse
low frame times than both the 1979-80 so
there's another trade off there as seems
to be the case with AMD right now we
tested a lot of other configurations -
like fallout 4 shadow of Mordor and Just
Cause 3 you can check the link in the
description below to see our results on
those games so what's the answer then
well it depends on what you're trying to
do a lot of games can actually be
supported on 34:40 by 1440 with lower
end graphics cards like the 960 and 380
X but it just depends on what type of
games dirt rally or any third game and
the total war games are good examples of
titles that you can actually play at
this high resolution as long as you're
willing to sacrifice some of your game
quality if you dip down to medium or
even in some cases low media mix or
medium high mix so if you're willing to
do that you're willing to tune your
settings and sacrifice some of that
fidelity visually in exchange for a
higher resolution and a wider experience
it's more than just a high resolution in
this instance then you can play on
mid-range cards now why you would buy
something like a $1200 ultra wide when
you have a 960 I don't know I probably
wouldn't suggest that but it is possible
if you found yourself in that situation
as for the higher-end titles if you want
it to stick to games like The Witcher 3
or just generally push ultra or high
settings at a minimum then you can
generally get away with a 970 and a 390
x1 or the other in some instances The
Witcher 3 included it's hard to hit
60fps even with a 970 and even with a
980 TI in that specific use case so
there are definitely still titles that
push these cards a bit too hard for the
high resolution to retain those maximize
settings but you can do all kinds of
tuning to drop the settings down
ways that you won't notice too much as a
user and still be able to get a good
experience on a 21 by 9 much wider
display than you're used to with the
normal 16 by 9 aspect ratio so there's a
lot that can be done and perhaps
contrary to popular belief it is
possible to play on these larger
resolution displays these ultra wide
with mid-range hardware just you do have
to note that low frame times can be an
issue in some games like the drops and
that is a game-by-game case you can see
in our benchmarks and then of course
just sacrificing game settings is
another scenario that you may have to
endure and games like GTA 5 The Witcher
3 and titles like that are going to be a
bit too abusive for even low settings of
the high resolutions so I have one
question signing off here for you all if
you could leave an answer in the
comments that would be fantastic I'm
curious about what you would rather do
if you have only one of two options
there's no middle-of-the-road option
here so option one if you have a high
resolution display and say a mid-range
card would you rather play the higher
resolution with slightly lower settings
or would you rather play a lower
resolution like 1080p which is not that
low and higher settings so what do you
value more the visual fidelity of models
and textures and things like that or do
you value more the visual fidelity of
just a higher resolution or a wider
peripheral vision in your gaming
experience let us know in the comments
