made something new the haisa tech Gen
six pump and cooling solution is now
coming out and it's going first to
Corsair who have a new h1 50 I Pro this
one right here three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator with the Gen six
pump and also an H 115 I Pro in these
same two hundred eighty millimeter
family as before just with the new pump
and new fans today we're going to be
reviewing the H 150 I just before CES as
well so after CES we're planning to do a
teardown of at least one of them stay
tuned for that but for now we can get
through the review before that this
video is brought to you by Leon Lee and
their 550 x and 330 cases the 550 X is a
$180 mid tower case with tempered glass
on all panels it's got three RGB LED
fans positioned in the front each of
which has a metal frame housing and an
open interior design if you prefer a
cheaper option the 330 is $100 and comes
without fans and as what we recommended
most heavily in one of our recent case
reviews learn more at the link in the
description below for the absolute
basics the coolers are 360 millimeters
to the H 150 I and 280 millimeters for
the 115 I both are demarcating with a
pro suffix the coolers also come with
Maglev fans without the RGB LEDs or any
LEDs at all so a bit cheaper than the
normal magnetic levitation fans and
other than that the focus is primarily
on silence there are not a whole lot of
changes to the ASA tech cooling solution
outright most of the changes involve
customizations to the PCB inside that
controls the LEDs for instance there's
another change in the cold plate it's a
couple millimeters smaller than the old
cold plate which is the first change to
a cold plate that ASA tech has done in
years more than I can remember at this
point so that's a somewhat major change
for them making the cold plate smaller
they also made the pump housing smaller
the block itself which means that really
aside from visual changes maybe you'll
have fewer clearance concerns although
those were no
for that much of a concern to begin with
the mounting mechanism is slightly
changed mostly for the better now
instead of having multiple drilled
through holes for Intel plates it's just
got the sliding set up so you can
accommodate basically any size and
strictly from a modding standpoint as we
do all of those hybrid mods for example
it makes sense that this kind of bracket
solution would be better because you can
accommodate things that it's not meant
to accommodate like video cards so
that's a small change that's not as
significant as some of the others like
the ml fan inclusion tubes are coming
out of the side now so it's back to the
way it was in Gen 4 instead of coming
out of the top and Gen 5 for Corsair
coolers and they're mounted to 90 degree
elbow Achatz the fans can spin down to
zero rpm when they do so they will slave
to the liquid temperature rather than
CPU temperature for instance and so
following liquid temperature they will
spin up at 45 degrees Celsius which is
something we'll talk about more at the
end of the video besides all these the
prices the H 150 I Pro is a hundred and
seventy dollars making it one of the
most expensive closed-loop liquid
coolers on the market and the H 115 I
Pro is a little bit cheaper than that
comes in at $140 the 280 millimeter
solution most of the marketing for these
focuses on noise so we'll be focusing on
noise normalized performance for the
most part meaning that we are
normalizing the noise level of all the
coolers we have on that particular chart
for 40 decibels that is system noise in
a room with a 26 DBA noise floor so of
course the noise levels are always going
to be a bit different than what the
manufacturer reports because they're
measuring probably in an anechoic
chamber or something similar to that so
we're targeting 40 DBA for noise
normalization and then we'll have the
flat out performance as well let's get
into that for test methodology as always
you can check the link in the
description below for the article
that'll tell you how we tested it and
give you a written summary of what we're
about to go through
let's start our thermals with flat out
performance and then move on to noise
normalized performance testing our focus
here is fans and
set machspeed though we do have lower
rpm numbers present we'll give it a
noise normalize test more focus in a
moment for now we're seeing the corsair
h 150 i right around levels of the h 115
IV - not the new one at 1500 rpm or the
ice bear 420 with the high rpm EVGA fans
rather than the stock ones keep in mind
that test variance places everything
within the thirty four point five to
thirty six point five degree range as
functionally equal surrounding the H 150
I Pro also keep in mind that appreciable
differences are lacking at this point as
it's rare to gain significantly from an
extra one or two degrees reduction in
temperatures GPUs are perhaps the
primary exception to this particularly
in high overclock scenarios regardless
the coarser h 150 i maintains an average
idle temperature and sits toward the
upper quarter of coolers because the h
150 i focus is more on operating quietly
thermal performance isn't a leader until
normalizing for other coolers most of
the thermal performance you're seen thus
far can be attributed to limited thermal
gains generationally in the asa tech
solution with Corsairs medium speed fans
contributing to the rest of the
performance differential setting the
pump to quiet mode by the way results in
significantly warmer temperatures aged
150 i moves down to forty nine point
nine degrees celsius over ambient for
load temperature or twelve degrees for
idle this is an increase of fourteen
degrees from the high speed pump and is
repeatable in testing to be fair though
quiet does significantly reduce pump
speed the reported rate falls from 2800
RPM to around 1100 RPM looking at noise
normalized performance at 40 DBA
the corsair cooler is able to leverage
its larger 360 millimeter radiator size
keeping temperatures to about thirty six
point eight degrees over ambient load
this also lands course earning the top
of the charts here and it's within
margin of error of our ex 62 and celsius
as 36 measurements these units are all
functionally equal in our testing
coarser is able to spin down to a zero
rpm operating mode giving it
bit of an upper hand here if no load is
on the system it can spin down to zero
and sustain idle or simple browser like
processing without spinning up at least
until liquid hits 45 for full system
noise with passively cold components
other than the CPU and a noise floor of
26 DBA the corsair unit measured out at
around 43 DBA on our meter the only
other thing on the system making noise
is a 23% blower fan from 98 Ti which
makes basically zero noise at least
until the low end of cooler rpms this
cooler is one of the quietest when
operating at its maximum speed while
still retaining some of its thermal
performance it's certainly not the most
impressive cooler on the bench
particularly in price the performance
value but it's a mid pack competitor
that performs average thermally for its
size or above average for noise the pump
is responsible for making a good deal of
that noise by the way and more sensitive
users will likely want to operate on
either balanced or quiet profiles the
full speed profile makes a noticeable
and audible ticking just like some of
the older ASA tech pumps this will be
somewhat obfuscated by cases but not
entirely it just depends on how
sensitive you are to that specific type
of noise it is possible of course that
other system fans could spin up to a
point where the pump noise becomes
inaudible the technology underneath the
cooler hasn't changed all that much it's
mostly led changes and then some small
changes like returning the tubes to be
90-degree right angle brackets off the
side of the pump housing other than that
you've got a slight cold plate size
difference some new LEDs new fans go
into the ML series instead which is
definitely one of the benefits on the
noise front for Corsair but they are
kind of weak when it comes to flat-out
performance but to be fair their target
isn't flat-out performance its silenced
so that's what they're going for here
other items of note you'll get about a
two degree improvement with manual
spread of thermal paste on an X 99 sized
platform so when we did our testing we
used a static thermal paste
versus a Sutekh thermal paste when it
was applied in the sort of half dollar
size amount on the cold blade and we did
see performance uplift by shifting over
to the way we do all of our testing
which is manually spreading the thermal
compound so there's a bit of a
performance gain there it doesn't cover
the entire IHS of larger CPUs and you
could benefit a bit it'll still operate
perfectly fine without manual spread but
it's something to keep in mind so your
RPM mode waiting for 45-degree liquid
temperatures is a bit interesting
because part of the whole deal with this
cooler when we were speaking with
Coursera days attack at Computex last
year now was that the Gen six pump is
supposed to hopefully be stepping away
from leaning entirely on liquid
temperature and lean instead a bit more
on CPU temperature for example so liquid
temperatures a bit funny
depending on how good the CPU is at
transferring its heat to the liquid
cooler the liquid temperature could be
quite low compared to the temperature of
the CPU a great example of this would be
a 7700 K overclocked where you could
easily get into the 90s Celsius for your
core temperature and liquid temperature
on an X 60 to 280 millimeter cooler with
max fan speeds would be sitting at low
30s
so big differential there and of course
if you turn the fans off completely
liquid temperature will increase we've
seen it and you never want to exceed 60
on these ASA tech coolers so 45 is a
good point to toggle on for the Corsair
unit it's just a question of does it
turn on when you need it to and for the
most part the answer is yes it's just
going to depend partially on the CPU
that you're using because the transfer
between the die to the IHS to the cooler
can have some latency with regard to the
thermal interface between all of those
so it might be a bit latent on spending
backup but you're not gonna lose that
much you might like maybe start getting
into the 90s and if you're overclocking
you shouldn't be using a zero rpm
solution anyway so these are all the
things are considered overall as a
product the H 150 I pro is priced
towards the top of the market it's right
up there with the crack in X 62 X 62 is
has been one of the most expensive
sometimes almost it's just not really in
a worthy way it's helped that price for
far too long in the 150-160 range so
this comes in above that it's a bit
bigger it has different RGB LED options
if you prefer these and that's really
the primary difference other than the
size which is the biggest driver but the
thermal performance is not all that
different it just comes down to what can
you fit in your case and of course if
you put aftermarket fans on them that
changes a bit because you've got 360
versus 280 so it's not bad in terms of
value proposition it's just expensive
which is fair the H 115 I Pro is much
more palatable at $140 that's around
where the EVGA CLC 280 originally
shipped I think that was 130 and the H
115 I non-pro used to be about 130 ish
as well so 140 seems fair for the H 115
I Pro though we don't have numbers for
it today so the pricing there seems
definitely a bit more palatable than
though 150 I Pro this one's not bad it's
just you really have to want that
corsair brand the pump plate and RGB
LEDs on it and then the rest is all the
size of the radiator basically and
there's valid reasons to want that
radiator size so we'll leave that up to
you the product itself we have not found
any significant flaws with it at this
time so nothing really to complain about
in a big way there that's always a good
thing we will be taking it apart to look
at the gen 6 cooler and see what else
has changed but other than that I think
that pretty much wraps it up so you find
