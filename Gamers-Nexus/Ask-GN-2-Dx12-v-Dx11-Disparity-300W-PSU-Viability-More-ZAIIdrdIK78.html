tada and we're back with another ask GN
video this is our second episode the
first one was fairly well liked you guys
posted a lot of questions in the
comments and we're gonna address a few
more of those today in this ask GN video
again this is a pretty unscripted
straightforward Q&amp;amp;A with the comments
that are received via Twitter Facebook
or just YouTube comments for the channel
and we're gonna go over a few of those
today so the previous video talked about
a couple of things like the 4790k vs.
the 67 100k for 3ds max we talked about
DTF ddr3l
versus ddr3 and today we're starting
with sanic or Sonic who says I hope I
see you at PAX our odds are low though
not really a question but this does
bring up something I wanted to point out
for everyone we will be at PAX this
weekend this video should be going live
on a Monday or Tuesday and will be at
PAX the ensuing weekend so that would be
Friday through Sunday we'll be there
recovering the show and there will be a
lot of coverage on the website gamers
Nexus on that and of course a lot of
video coverage as well if you happen to
see us there you're gonna be present
don't hesitate to say hi to anyone in a
gamers Nexus shirt there will be three
of us working the show and we might be
in a rush but we certainly happy to talk
with anyone who wants to come over and
say hi so yes we will be at PAX and the
first real question here Run 4 pixels
says please tell me the gtx 950 is
possible with my 300 watt power
consumption and I think what run for
pixel's means here is pretty simply will
the GTX 950 work with a 300 watt power
supply and that really depends on a lot
of things that depends on the other
hardware as always I have hair in my
face so the 950 we just reviewed in
video and written form and it is one of
the lowest power consuming cards of its
output in terms of frame rate graphics
fidelity that we've tested yet so it's
got a 90 watt TDP in testing I found
that with a 4790k 32 gig of ram and a
of SSDs which is our testbench for every
GPU in a single GPU configuration we
found that that configuration consumes
about 200 watts of power I think it was
199 or 201 somewhere in there with a 960
you go up a little bit towards 216 220
somewhere in that range but with the 950
you're around or under 200 watts with a
4790k at stock and 32 gigabytes of RAM
at I think it was 1.5 volt kit maybe
1.65 though either way pretty powerful
hardware and under 300 watts the thing
with power supplies is they are fairly
complicated I know it's a thing that I
think a lot of builders will sort of
just pick one that has good reviews on
Newegg and add it to the cart but
there's certainly a lot more to them
than that we just published an article
on voltage ripple for one example of how
power supplies can be complex at the
base level and when it comes to power
supplies the core item is efficiency and
not just wattage so what you're looking
at is how efficient does the power
supply fuel the amount of power demanded
by the system how efficient is that
process and generally most power
supplies do best when they're sitting at
60 to 80% power consumption depending on
the manufacturer the supplier and the
spec so the ATX spec is the most common
one for the types of systems that we're
all building and you'll want to look at
the power supply manufacturers website
to determine where their PSU performs
best but if you're assuming the average
60% load you probably want a little bit
more than 300 watts for peak efficiency
meaning when the CPU and GPU are under
100% load you want a little bit of
headroom for allowing fluctuations for
allowing loss through heat efficiency
loss and that would put you in the 350
range in general you can definitely run
a gtx 950 with a 300 watt power supply
if it's efficient if it has good
components and of course depending on
your other components in the system so
if you're running something like an FX
9000 series chip which is a 220 watt TDP
then the answer would be no you would
need something more powerful than 200
300 watts you need something closer to
500 to allow for that efficiency window
but if you're running an Intel processor
or the modern AMD APU s anything really
in the less than 100 watt range for TDP
on the CPU then you will be able to get
by on a 300 watt power supply hopefully
that answers that question and if you
have more questions about power supplies
check out the website we actually have a
whole dictionary that talks about power
supply specs we talk about voltage
ripple efficiency 80-plus certifications
so check gamers excist on that for that
info
moving on Shawn Wright asks how long do
you think the 980ti will remain the
fastest asterisk single GPU card and
defines the asterisk as ignoring Titan X
so this is a good question first of all
Shawn here makes the distinction single
GPU card so that's pretty important
because that means that the video card
has one GPU on it in this case the GM
200 so we're ruling out things like the
295x2 and any potential dual GPU cards
that Nvidia may or may not make in the
future so looking at single GPU
solutions then at the high end it's the
sort of the 980ti and the fury x in the
gaming range and then you've got Titans
of course we're ignoring the Titan X
here per the question and you've got AMD
FirePro series and the fire pro series
is really not within gaming range just
like the Quadro series is not within
gaming range so we're gonna roll those
out and look strictly at knee gaming
marketed cards ignoring the Titan X
which is oddly a gaming marketed card
despite the Titans legacy so the nine
ATI is I would agree with the premise
that it is among the fastest single GPU
solutions on the market right now
depending on what you're testing
certainly is the fastest in a lot of
tests that we've conducted depending on
the version of the 980ti the
manufacturer how long will it remain the
fastest or one of the fastest at this
point we don't have any good data that
there will be GP launches before Pascal
or before am these Arctic Isles series
so
until that point I would suspect that
the 980ti will remain at the top of its
class I would certainly expect some sort
of high-end launch from one of the two
manufacturers at some point in the near
future even if it's just a refresh or
it's a dual GPU launch or whatever I I'm
not being coy here we really just don't
have any information right now so I
would expect something at some point it
might be a Titan because Titan is due
for another update in the future that
may be a dual precision Titan though but
the the short answer really is that I
have no good information on this
question it's not me being under embargo
or NDA we just don't have an answer and
I would imagine that you won't see
massive gains until the new
architectures from Andy and NVIDIA are
both out and that would be Arctic Isles
and Pascal both of which I would predict
to be available Pascal we know to be
available sometime within the next year
or so
NVIDIA has given us a couple of time
frames for Pascal we published all of
them we've seen 2016 through 2018 as one
of them so that would put it coming out
next year whether or not that's a game
in skew I really don't know it will be a
did I shrink though and the AMD Arctic
Isles one should also be a die shrink
they're both moving to HB m2 in theory
and that should be much faster than HP
m1 which is already really impressively
fast and it'll be more capacity 8 to 16
gigabytes in the likely range there so
that's when I would expect the biggest
shift moving on lethality from Twitter
asked hey guys curious your take on the
disparity of AMD versus Nvidia in the
real world DX 12 benchmarks coming out
so this is something that is certainly
worth addressing we are going to pack
soon so I'm not gonna have time to run
the x12 benchmarks right now but there's
more than that to it I'm waiting for us
to have more to work with for DX 12 so
that is an important item of note here
as I walk into this so the disparity
between AMD and NVIDIA there's been a
lot of benchmarks run lately and for
those who may have seen them I'll just
shout PC perspective was among the first
group to publish a few there been some
German ones I've gone lied
gone online excuse me and the disparity
that's being discussed here is that AMD
has seen a larger gain in general from
dx11 to the x12 performance and vidi has
seen a pretty small gain from dx11 2d
x12 performance moving between the api's
so why is that happening well it's it's
a little bit simplified right now
there's only one game that's really even
a testable title it's ashes of
singularity or something like that that
is the only game that is presently using
dx12 in any capacity any official
capacity that game is an alpha that game
is made by Star doc who are at least
have some partnership with AMD and have
worked with mantle in the past and it's
just it's one game so all games will
perform differently the DX travel
feature levels are going to be tapped
into differently for different games so
this is not a benchmark that is
indicative of platform wide GPU hardware
level wide or software level wide
performance for DirectX 12 it is a
benchmark of ashes of singularity using
dx12 what's the current hardware but
it's not the best indicator of overall
performance until we really get more
games that are coming out in a
real-world scenario using the X 12 other
than the 3d mark API overhead test which
is a great test but it's not meant for
comparing GPUs even 3d mark says that
pretty directly on their page so what is
our take on it what is my take on it I
would say that I'm personally waiting
for more software to be available in the
real-world application area to actually
test the x12 and I think also worth
noting is that Nvidia has very seriously
invested in optimizing for DirectX 11 in
the past and in the immediate future and
to this end we'll see smaller gains for
Nvidia from DX 11 to 12 because they've
invested so much in dx11 that they're
really hitting the cap of what it's
capable of already andy has struggled
quite a bit for their driver launches in
recent past in the last few months last
three months in particular they really
have stepped up their game for dry
so definitely a good thing in that
regard it's not nearly as bad as it was
a couple of back in December was their
first major launch in quite a while and
then it was silent for 180 days so
they've gotten better but they have
never been particularly good with
DirectX 11 performance so that means
we're seeing bigger gains from Andy from
dx11 to dx12 one interesting note is
that the jump for AMD from DX 11 to 12
is putting them close to parity with
NVIDIA either few FPS above you have PS
below either way the 390 X is close to
parity with the 980 and the benchmarks
that we've seen and the internal ones
we've conducted and haven't published so
that is certainly promising for those
who want a more competitive video card
market and it's just not include it's
not the full picture so I would say kind
of hang back for a moment don't just
jump on the AMD it's gonna crush on
video or Nvidia is gonna crush AMD boat
just yet
because it's not clear we need more
games we need more of the complete
picture before we can really start
tearing into DX 12 and how it will
impact the GPU marketplace a couple more
here Peter grata note says hi Steve when
are you going to touch these otech 980ti
amp extreme we've heard a lot about this
card heard that it's a pretty good
overclocker
here's the thing we published a review a
little while ago about the GTX 980
Xtreme I think it was the original 980
Xtreme not the TI version from ZOTAC and
at that time we were very firm in our
statement not to buy that video card
because it had some very serious over
volting and overclocking issues and I've
heard from various readers that those
issues have been resolved I've heard
from others that they still exist and
unfortunately we can't validate that
either way because we don't have the 980
Xtreme anymore
to validate it was sent back and I have
not received any test hardware from
ZOTAC since that point so when will we
get the zotac 980 I have extreme I would
not bet on it unless I can get a friend
who will buy it and then borrow that for
few days in bench market I would not bet
on us getting one of those in the
immediate future I will certainly try
and see if so attack would be interested
in sending us a review sample but based
on our last review of the 980 extreme
it's it's just not a not an easy thing
to get right now and then finally Grande
ratio says two days ago you look like a
girl so I'm not really sure how to
respond to that comment but thank you I
suppose that is Hall for this ask a GN
video please leave your comments below
if you have any questions for the next
video and again we're at pax so come say
hi and if you like the kind of content
we produce check out our patreon page
it's in the post roll video we've now
gone up to nine backers on patreon so
again slow growth but extremely helpful
because it does help us keep producing
this content we've away from traditional
advertising things like that and of
course I've got Keegan working on the
video and video editing aspect of this
so it's a growing team at this point and
the support certainly helps cover all
the bases so that's all for this one I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
