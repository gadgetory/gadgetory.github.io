today he is from he's joined us before
and from real-world Tech also ml per org
has some contributions there and today
we're talking our Intel's new
announcements so things like the 3d
approach to CPU design really
interesting stuff we're gonna go pretty
technical on this also we just got done
at the event and we have no good set
option so we're in a hotel for which I
apologize
but you can listen to the video it's
great content and we're going to talk
about some technical details today
before that this video is brought to you
by Thermaltake scorpy three case the
core p3 is one of the most unique cases
on the market it can serve as an
open-air standing chassis a test bench
in vertical or horizontal orientation or
as a wall-mounted showcase pc the core
p3 now comes with a five millimeter
thick tempered glass panel for its side
but keeps the front top and back open
for air the core p3 versatility as a
display piece test bench or standard
desktop is reinforced by its price of
roughly one hundred and ten dollars on
amazon you can learn more at the link in
the description below our main topic
today where we talk about this new Intel
discussion so we were both out here in
the bay area for talk about Intel's
upcoming sunny Cove was I guess the main
one and then just the architecture in
general they had IGP stuff they had FPGA
they had a bit of everything today yeah
and I mean I think the other thing is
that it was you know for the last two
years it's been somewhat difficult to
get technical information out of India
about different things and you know part
of it is it's sort of on the big course
I'd been skylake for a long time and
some of the atom cores they don't really
publish a lot of details about 40
nanometer for a long time right which is
changing yeah and so you know I think
that the the point of today was really
to talk about okay here's what we have
coming here's what we're doing and
here's how we think about
you know plugging in technologies and
making them work together to deliver
awesome products right the next few
years so then what I know there's
there's a lot of stuff we'll have some
online already and there'll be news
reports with all the basics but one of
the bigger things here is I guess the 3d
approach you know design so I mean
that's I think I have some photos of it
but they had diagrams showing like 3d
stacked components right and this is not
necessarily a new idea but it's new to
see it implanted by Intel as far as I'm
aware yeah well and I think it's also
sort of back up like let's just start
out with like what what's going on with
3d and packaging seven point five gigs
there's tons of terms out there and
frankly it can be a little confused yes
what is is 3d even a valid term or is it
a marketing here is that a technical
correct term yeah so actually
conveniently it is it's also one of
those ones that actually sounds good
from a market that's not like 3d crest
white
yeah no no definitely not no um and I
don't think there's any blue sparkles
with this right either so it added bonus
ya know so you know if you look at
traditional chips as we've built them
you know you get a single chip and you
know if you're lucky everything's
integrated on there or almost everything
and so what we saw with Vega and with
the high-end volt of e 100 and the P 100
before it is that you can do what's
called a 2.5 D stack where you have
ships together in the same plane so it's
not truly 3d but then there's a backing
interpose oh right and so that allows
you to connect them up over metal wires
that go through silicon as opposed to
through the path does uh does VG fall
into this as well or the fury acts yeah
so I think that was the first to use HBM
right high bandwidth memory and Cydia
that was one of the first examples of I
use it 2.5 D would you call that
yeah 2.5 D right because it's you know
it's sort of going vertebrae
not quite and then so Intel came along
and they have a customized version of
that called mm the embedded multi
interconnect bridge and that's a little
bit different it's sort of more
two-dimensional but with a lot of the
benefits of 2.5 g at a lower price point
and that's actually used in the strat
extend EGA is currently and may be used
in other contexts as well sort of in
future products and it is also used
actually in the can't remember the name
of it but the event today no no the the
the Intel CPU with the Radeon Vega
graphic Hades Canyon yes Hades yeah so
that actually uses email is my
understanding so Ava so the next step
beyond that is rather than taking our
die side-by-side and then attaching them
through some sort of silicon underneath
is to have them one on top of it another
and to connect them up vertically and so
I actually thought that they did a great
job talking through some of the
challenges of that but also some of the
opportunities so you know I think you
were the one who actually asked the
question we were enough round table
together ok well if we're gonna take a
bunch of pieces of silicon right how do
you cool them yes you you have as they
show on the photo is it correct to call
it logic dies is that what they are
allowed or what yeah different
domination but but either way the point
is that you have so on the bottom on the
top you have something in the middle if
it's three dimensionally stacked well if
you have three of them know you've got
three of them all right and yeah if you
have three of them and so you you end up
with one in the middle that has no
direct connection to a service on top or
a service on bottom right how do you
call it right and we did talk with with
Jim Keller about this a little bit yeah
and and right and so realistically in
most packaging solutions only one of
those die is going to be directly
connected with your heat sink so that
guy will cool really
well the other one what is the bottom
layer and interpose or is that the most
immediate layer whoa so in 2.5 D it's
interposer and then active chips on top
so there's only one surface a medium
heat for all intents and purposes and so
that the cooling for that is pretty
straightforward but where you get to 3d
where maybe you have several different
layers of logic now all of those are
active so they're switching so they're
all burning power right and emitting
Heat and so there's no real interposer
they're necessarily okay I mean you
might have it but but yeah so then the
challenge is well okay which dye do you
want to be touching the heatsink and
then how does everyone else dissipate
their power and what's the order that
you do it in so for example memory DBM
when you heat it up the leakage gets
worse so the Refresh time needs to be
more frequent mmhmm right so that's
going to hurt your performance and it's
bad news all around so you know you
don't really want to have the DRAM
necessarily sitting right on top of
really hot stuff like say your floating
point you right and so you know when we
got into the discussion he brought up
registers as well I think
yeah register files and you're backing
up when you look at a CPU core there's
some parts that are gonna be really hot
like register files floating point units
anything that's switching a ton on a
really regular basis like every clock
you know when you look at a thermal
image those those are the red spots you
know I remember Pentium 4 the the red
spots was those double pumped a I'll use
that we're running at like 10 gigahertz
right it's like oh yeah that burns a lot
of power Yeah right don't put that near
anything sensitive so you know and then
then you have like your your cache
arrays which are frequently inactive
because you're only going to be
accessing one line at a time
you know maybe 2 or 3 that's gonna be
much cooler over
and so you know the answer that I heard
was there's no magic bullet for cooling
there's just careful design and planning
and place things accordingly though
don't put very hot things like the
things that are very thermally sensitive
yeah yeah and then the other aspect is
how do you get the power in mm-hmm
right because if you take a look at ice
Lake server or any of these really big
high-powered chips
they've got thousands of pins of which
many are used to drive power in and
ground pins and so that's fine but you
know if we're gonna go stacking things
not all of those have pins that are
directly connected to the outside world
right and so if you're you know imagine
you're like a 10 high stack well the guy
who has to go through nine others has a
worse power delivery network in a worse
ground plane mm-hmm and everyone else
and so how do you how do you cope with
it and again the answer is design
although I would say in terms of power
delivery Intel's voltage regulators and
you know the fully integrated voltage
regulator that they hadn't as well and
then Broadwell and in their server chips
still could be very useful you could
imagine having a dedicated voltage
regulator right and they did not they
were not able to confirm its existence
and the upcoming products yeah they
didn't seem too keen on top yeah we did
ask and I believe the answer was Roger
looked over her shoulder at PR and yeah
yeah yeah I mean I suspect it'll be back
but we'll see you know we didn't find
out as they say yes yes yeah so I
thought those were some of the issues
and the other thing that Roger mentioned
was the known good die problem which is
that we don't want to connect up
multiple thighs
into you know say $1,000 chip and then
only later find out that one of them was
mad
so how do they how do you deal with that
yeah are you testing or yeah well so you
can do testing pre-packaging but it's
you know added cost data complexity is
very logistical expensive yeah and you
can't test everything obviously if you
only put it into a package afterwards
you can't test the package yeah and so
if you if you break things in the
packaging process well you're stuck yeah
unless you can map those out so you know
I think those were some of the key areas
they identified but you know to me it's
really exciting because one of the
things they didn't get into a lot in
part because it's not a manufacturing
event is well what are the the things
that have done that right and so I think
a lot of it is just giving designers at
a lot more flexibility yeah they
mentioned that this opens a lot of you
know a lot of doors that they didn't
really explore for today so there was
definitely discussion of how the the new
approach versus previous designs well I
guess one of the questions was yours
asking about give me a number
10% 15% yeah right and the you didn't
really get a firm response but you did
get an interesting response which was
well it's not always just about it's
important to look at those numbers
percent improvement but also we're
interested in looking at
he Keller's had more fun ways to improve
the product right yeah I mean I got
I mean Jim's answer was sort of in some
respects very unintelligent into a
particular growth rate it's people get
excited by big steps form right brand so
we want to excite people that's actually
kind of more of a Steve Jobs kind of
mentality which makes sense given that
you know Jim and Roger work together yet
at you know Apple priority MD right
I did think it was an interesting answer
though because you were getting a
complete non answer right up until that
point yeah and and for him to actually
commit to something even if it was sort
of a sidestep it was a valid sidestep so
I thought that was that was a good point
of recognition actually Intel in general
seemed a lot more loose in this event
there were self-aware this event than
normally oh yeah where they like there
were there were I wrote down the quotes
somewhere we'll probably publish them
but quotes about like there was
definitely some humble pie and we're
eating it was from Murthy yes yeah and
so Intel's self-aware and they they know
their position in the market they know
they're challenged in some areas right
now yeah so that was very different to
see from any company but especially you
know yeah I mean you know I think this
happens everyone and I thought that you
know AMD when they were really on the
ropes was sort of similarly self-aware
right you know so but you know to me
going back to like okay what are the
advantages that that the 3d stacking and
the 2.5 D and all these more complex
packaging schemes bring is that you can
really optimize your silicon in
different ways and you know the the
easiest example maybe the most relevant
is the ideal process technology for a
CPU and a GPU is really different right
for the CPU we want the fastest
transistors we want the fastest circuit
design and that typically means larger
transistors that are more loosely spaced
that means a tapered metal stack with
more layers and that's what allows you
to run and you know greater than five
bigger which I'll mention also as a
question we brought up of okay so can we
expect at initial launch of a 10
nanometer desktop part which I
specifically phrased it that way so I
didn't want to say can you expect the
same frequencies of a 10 nanometer part
yeah the answer is yes
at some point the answer was still
basically yes so the question was for
the initial 10 nanometer product
launches on desktop will we see the same
frequency as we see 40 nanometer plus
plus plus
how many pluses there are yeah I think
it's I mean in some sense 14 plus plus
is a marketing thing right but what are
the particular iteration right working
the animator that Emma and Raj know more
or less said well we're not going to
release a product that's worse right so
that was the answer yeah I mean I took
you his answer to mean two things so one
is you know we're not gonna go backwards
in performance and then probably exactly
backwards in frequency but at the same
time the first 10 nanometer parts are
definitely not for the desktop and so
that's you know more of a mobile tuning
process right so you know when you're
looking at these desktop parts you know
you don't care much about leakage all
right
not nearly as much from yeah I mean it's
just not not a super big deal and you
want to run it high frequency and so
then it turns out there's actually some
like physical transistor effects that do
let you run faster but kind of hurt you
on the leakage side and so some of these
things are typically perceived as being
a negative and from a process technology
standpoint at least a lot of people talk
about that as a negative right thing you
want to minimize but if you actually
look at the real characteristics it
actually means the transistor runs
faster which for some people is more
what you care about sorry yeah exactly
right but then when we talk about GPUs
right you know we want maximum
transistor density and you know it
doesn't have to run anywhere close to 5
gigahertz right you'd much rather have a
more power efficient transistor and it's
only gonna run it like 1 to 2 gigahertz
so that's one example another is if
you're doing a mobile part right you
might care a lot about low leakage yes I
would say that is a particular sense
particularly sensitive use case where
yeah
yeah cuz you're dealing with you know
limited battery life so yeah exactly
and even within the context of a
microprocessor there's still different
blocks that want different things you
know a good example is your Ondine
memory your SRAM
if you stick it in a processor you know
your typical processor is gonna have
something like 10 to 15 layers of metal
wire well if you're just doing a lot die
of SRAM you don't need nearly that much
you can probably get away with 5 so you
can cut down your cost quite
considerably so you could imagine a
future microprocessor where you say okay
the core and the register files and the
l1 cache that's all in cutting-edge 10
plus plus and then we're gonna have a
separate l2 cache in l3 cache that are
in like 10 nanometer a certain processes
alright so there's a bunch of different
ways to think about slicing this up but
until you have that 3d or 2.5 D inner
can enhancement that is high-bandwidth
low-latency and very power efficient all
those options are off the table right
you know from an engineering perspective
this just gives us a lot more toys to
play with right right not to mention the
mixing the DRAM and storage and all
sorts of other different things that are
on different types yes
yeah yes there was a whole separate
thing on opt in for example earlier
today - yeah and all this stuff so how
what are your feelings overall with the
the 3d design approach that ends all
talking about I mean do you yeah top
level he thinks the right direction or
challenges they might face that you
think are significant yeah I mean I
think the biggest challenge is getting
it done cost-effectively and we know
that it can be done Intel's done it with
hemad you know tsmc has their approach
the Nvidia uses and Google is using but
these are for typically machine learning
chips and right you know fairly bespoke
things we've seen a lot in recent HPC
ramage
chips out of Japan from him NEC and
Fujitsu and that's fine but these are
all chips that are being sold or valued
at multiple thousands of dollars right I
think the thing that gets interesting is
okay can I deliver this at a $200 $300
and with millions of units yeah exactly
and so scaling things into volume is
always a little bit tricky and so I'd
say the cost side of the equation is you
know that's the proof will be in the
pudding yeah and then there are some
some more specific technical
difficulties one of which is depending
on how they're implementing things
EEMA biz is really interesting and one
of the things that's interesting is
unlike the tsmc approach when you have
your two die the ruling next to each
other and then there's sort of a bridge
underneath but it's a small bridge and
so one of the challenges is the two dies
here have separate bumps to connect to
the outside world and then to connect to
the bridge and those bridge bumps the
micro bumps because they're different
pitch it actually makes things like
structurally physically fairly
challenging because you now have big
bumps on one part of the dice walnuts on
the other and if they were to heat up
and behave differently you could get
crack anymore things like that so just
the physical engineering around that and
getting it to align correctly is is not
trivial and TSM C's approaches a lot
simpler it's we're gonna make everything
out of silicon it's all on one silicon
piece in one module so you've now have a
lot more silicon which costs you more
money but it is structurally one so you
know the question is okay how does how
does this sort of the cost of R&amp;amp;D and of
validation of potentially RMA or at
least wasted silica or wasted parts does
that exceed the gains that TSMC would
experience yeah and it the easy way
I mean I would I would phrase it
differently it won't get into production
unless all those things are on right
right of course and so that's why I say
the proof is in the pudding when they
get to volume and where do they
introduce it and it's you know I think a
lot of these things it's fine if it
starts out in a premium part maybe it's
really in mobile where you can justify
paying for it but the exciting thing is
really to get that out everywhere and
then you know also I think again seeing
the solutions that they have for power
delivery and cooling mm-hmm gonna be
pretty exciting yes definitely
especially with Intel's renewed interest
in better interfaces
yes solder previously needs some work
but they're not anywhere close to
talking about that today I don't think
cuz it's yeah I'd have to get through
the rest of the product first they're
not even talking frequencies today yeah
I mean it was very much a high level
type discussion so you know I mean Intel
seems they have this very interesting
relationship with the high end over
marketing community and they absolutely
want to support it they put features in
for it right but then you know on some
of the parts you know as I think you've
talked about at length yeah yeah their
material choices leave a bit to be
desired yeah it's hard to look at the
cost equation I don't really know how
much this stuff costs in volume
any other so for sunny Cove I guess is
is that the most immediate desktop part
or what is what is the what's the most
immediate thing we're looking for the
desktop space okay cuz there are a lot
of things today yeah so I mean that was
definitely one of the more exciting
things which was sunny Cove is the code
name for the CPU core that is inside of
isolate yeah yeah yeah so I had always
thought the court was called I slave but
right yes that's not true so either they
just made up the code name or you know
didn't seem to exist online before today
yeah so if it was hidden it was it was
very well yeah and so they gave a lot
more details on that and it's a wider
higher performance form that's pretty
exciting I mean we've been sitting here
with skylake and its derivatives for a
long time yeah so seeing those changes
is great and in part because Intel's had
a lot of time to make these advances and
I'm sure it's very frustrating for a lot
of the architects at Intel to have you
know new architectures that they put up
and held down and can't ship right Oh
tethered by their manufacturing process
to some it's them yeah and I mean it's
even worse for the folks who worked on
cannon Lake which went from you know
being a major product that was going to
be across all the different segments to
you know just functionally dead they had
a they had a couple of products out
there's the knock rate there's the i3
whatever but there it was also the thing
that was released before but yeah I mean
cannon like is not really shipping in
any real ball right that's more it's
there for low this point look yeah look
we did it we ship yeah well but and
that's the challenge right which is you
know this was a design team as you know
get let's get something from an
nanometer up and ready as soon as
possible so we can ship it right that's
the right talk way and then wait for the
architecture but if the process isn't
ready then when you have your new
architecture it's gonna be better than
the old one so right and they I did I
will note as well they Keller and Raja
Midori which I haven't properly
introduced either of them but if you
don't know Roger - dorri I did a video
with him a few years ago used to work at
AMD at RTG function it was the lead and
now at Intel yeah and Cal are known for
also doing significant work at AMD yeah
so yeah I mean Jim's career is
I mean both of them have been pretty
lengthy career so Jim was at digital
initially then he went over at AMD
they're both at Apple for a little bit I
think yes they're at Apple together Jim
was also I think he was at SCI byte and
then he left AMD he was at PA semi which
was doing PowerPC chips for Apple
actually for their notebooks but then
Apple famously switched to intent right
that was tough for PA semi but Apple
eventually bought them and so then that
for the basis of the CPU and yeah one of
the things he was talking about was
continuing to potentially use 14
nanometer plus cost or whatever yeah and
not just phasing out these processes
right because if it's still an adequate
adequate piece of silicon for what
you're trying to achieve I guess then
why complicate it with something more
expensive and with more limited fab
space yeah and I mean I think his point
was a new process is no longer
everything to everyone
hmm and so and I think actually we've
seen this for a while right with
Broadwell right Rodwell was mostly
interesting on the mobile side and the
desktops particularly in the enthusiast
side were just not there right there
were certainly some I think like 45 watt
desktops but I don't think there was a
really a 90 watt client socket for well
and that's fine but the point is you
know okay so if we get a process it's
good for mobile and we lead with that
then we're gonna continue ship in the
old process for desktops right and the
other thing is and he did mention a
potential 15% increase and frequency or
performance or something like that did
you catch that well yes yes so he said
that they had come up with different
ways to tweak the transistors to boost
free clear right it's just a question of
whether they're going they have a
product to do it on
at this point yeah and you know what
what is the particular tweak what's the
Boston right but I think the point is
you there's a lot more performance you
can wring out of a process through
incremental tuning number one and then
the other thing that's kind of
interesting you can do a mix and match
with 3d here in 2.5 D so if you have you
know it just gives you a bit more
flexibility you can say you could you
could say okay look we want to take on a
14 plus plus CPU and combine it with a
10 nanometer GB right or whatever so
yeah and I think that was his statement
of you know we're gonna have several
process technologies in high volume that
we use across our product line
simultaneously and it's just one more
variable that we get to choose from
right right
any any final points you want to add in
here anything really major we didn't
talk about that you think is worth
mentioning well I mean one of the other
things I thought was interesting is they
read they didn't talk about on package
memory yes yeah right and a lot of this
was in the context of the the integrated
GPU but you know they also talked about
in the future
discrete GPUs and so I think it's great
to see people looking at okay how can we
boost performance and if before anyone
gets too excited the way in which they
talked about discrete GPUs in the future
primarily pretend to not talking about
them today
yes don't get too excited yeah but it
was mentioned yes yeah right so you know
I think that it's as many things that
Intel it's it's a gradual process right
so that I think the first step is a
higher performance integrated GPU and
then you know next couple years we'll
start seeing more more more variants at
higher performance levels and you know
my guess is the first thing they do will
not be a 300-watt monster right will be
more like a mid-range part and that's
fine
but the you know I think the point is
okay because they're looking in that
direction they're now driven to find
some in package memory solutions talked
about using lpddr4 X maybe LPG dr v in
the future but that could be quite
interesting if it's architected the
right way for you know cpu performance
as well i mean one of the you know sort
of interesting hoary old tales of the
industry was i think crystal well the
broad well with 128 megabytes of IDI RAM
in package yeah you know it turns out
that that 128 megabytes of l4 cache was
worth something like 800 megahertz on
some more clothes okay yeah and so that
actually beat ad intro some of the high
frequencies sky legs on some games right
yes I recall that yeah yeah it was also
a very rare part - yeah I remember so I
got one to test and like anon was so
annoyed at me because I tested it I have
some internal numbers that I used for
some calibrating some of my own models
but I never published anything you know
there's three people in the world who
got to play around with that you sit on
yours for like a couple months and
publish I'm like yeah what are you yeah
but you know the the thing that's
interesting is once you start playing
around with this embedded memory and
even if it's for a mid-range GPU it will
inevitably get pushed in different
directions right and so maybe we will
see an option to get a high end you know
5.5 gigahertz right you know ice lake
with with embedded memory that would be
really cool you know and they were
talking about you know I think the slide
said something along the lines of a
gigabyte there's a lot of memory yes yes
it is significant
yeah right I mean like I I don't know
how bigger some of the levels in these
games if you could keep that the whole
thing in cash that it
yeah gigabyte is especially because well
yeah I mean the biggest things are gonna
be dealing with are things like textures
yeah and even the they're large but a
gigabyte is significant when you're
talking about typically the 128
megabytes and the biggest recent
scenario yeah with crystal while I guess
that was forget over always called yeah
so I don't know other than that I think
that's that's are pretty good yeah I've
heard a lot of stuff I mean there's
plenty of other things we could talk
about EV PGA is at a yeah and everything
yeah you know on the octane side I think
we both agreed you're chatting about
this a little bit earlier but it's it's
really exciting you know mostly in the
dim form yes the the dim form factor for
sure and I would estimate that the
majority of our audience is familiar
with obtain from its initial
implementation which was MDOT to as a
cache drive and that was a terrible
start to obtain as a technology and
unfortunately because the name is the
same as in the dims everybody is just
associating it with that and going
obtain is garbage based on the comments
I've read so you know just to point out
the dim stuff is pretty cool yeah but
yeah I mean the the cache drive is kind
of a different story
yeah I mean I think this this was sort
of a scenario where basically Intel
needed to go to market with a product
then the dims weren't ready because the
server processor was going to attach to
wasn't ready so you know that's gonna be
cascade like when Silas talked about for
a bit today and III guess the one
interesting thing is of course cascade
Lake is a server chip but as we all know
these server chips do show up as yes are
they calling them core I nines now it's
hard to keep track more or less yeah
yeah but yeah the really high-end are
based on server chess so you know we may
get in the not-too-distant future
you know like q1 of next year enthusiast
systems where you can get up
DIMMs in pretty large capacity so right
that would be super exciting and I bet
they would be monsters the benchmark
yeah it would be a yep they'll be very
different yes you're testing
responsiveness at that point too right
not just oh yeah it's the whole system
would in theory be much faster yeah and
I mean I think you know this is just
something I was thinking about casually
is kind of a wild and crazy idea but you
know I think on my system I'm currently
running with something like maybe a
three or four hundred gigabyte SSD for
all my applications in OS and you know I
have a bunch of hard drives for holding
media and other things but you know you
can get a terabyte of octane dims no
problem so you could actually just have
a PC where everything sits in octane
yeah and you know if the latencies or
call it 300 nanoseconds for everything
yeah that's a lot better than the
microseconds we're used to it for an SSD
yes yes so definitely yeah I guess you
know that shove it on to memory memory
yes it's permanently in memory right so
you know how fast is windows booting
then all right yeah at that point you
just become bound by things like the
post check yeah just stuff like that
yeah yeah it's a really cool stuff on
the opt hand side we won't dive into
yeah we always talk about it yeah and
for more of David Cantor's work
real-world tech I guess is officially
where you can find some of his writing
yeah I'm on Twitter of course the cancer
yeah and and then m/l / you get
contributions too as well yeah and ml /
org is where you can go to check that
out
you know actually today is kind of a big
day for ml perf and for those who don't
know it's an industry standard benchmark
for a machine learning and it was
started out by folks from Google Baidu
Berkeley Harvard and you know it's not
really grown into a great organization
and so we're going to be having some
results from the first round of machine
learning training benchmarks and you
know if you puts into Nvidia or Intel or
you know Google or frankly anyone else
you know yeah that's like a big topic
and you know I think actually you know
when we were talking about some of
Nvidia czar TX some of the ray-tracing
you know actually uses machine learning
and to smooth out the the results and
then there's also been some work from
Nvidia on using machine learning for
anti-aliasing so you know it well it's
traditionally sort of a more data center
workload the results are absolutely
relevant to consumers everywhere and
it's something that I've been working on
a lot and I'm pretty excited about yeah
and I guess we I'll go ahead and put a
link below if there's a relevant site or
something I can link to yeah ml per org
and yeah depending on the time of day
there may be results up there for the
first round which is pretty exciting
very cool check that out well that's
that's it for this one so as always
subscribe for more you have I'll give
you links below for real world tech and
you can also go to patreon.com/scishow
and razaaq's i'll talk directly or the
store and david thank you for joining me
absolutely good to see you again to see
you we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
