at CES 2019 there are two products here
we're looking at primarily one is the
revolt 3 which 3-ball - you might
remember from like twenty fifteen or
sixteen or something there's one of the
first ads we ever did so we've all three
here is here but this is far more
interesting it's projects that snowblind
x4 and project snowblind we've I think
shown at CES and packs
year after year for a couple of years
now it's been more or less perfected on
the panel inside and it for a recap if
you don't remember it's just the side
panel is an LCD and you get a display
out on it a quick note here in a roll
shots these will not be scaled correctly
because I've removed two of the panel's
so this is one of the panels but that's
minor detail you'll see the correction
and b-roll for the proper scaling before
that this video is brought to you by the
deep cool captain 240 Pro AO cooler the
captain 240 Pro uses a bladder within
the water tank to expand and contract
based on liquid temperature as a leak
prevention mechanism this works by
birthing air at higher temperatures
making for a unique closed-loop liquid
cooler design the captain 240 Pro also
expands upon the existing captain series
by extending tube length for more
flexible positioning and updating the
LEDs
learn more at the link in the
description below so the paneling's been
more or less perfected this is a very
early prototype it was thrown together
pretty quickly for the show so things
will be cleaned up but the idea is it's
four panels from the snowblind on one
case and it's a cube so it's symmetrical
making things a bit easier to mock up
and then advanced upon that is the
rotation so here's where it gets a bit
difficult because you've clearly got
sort of four different compartmentalize
chambers or at least three it's about
how you how you cut it up and all those
have different cables I mean this
reservoir over here pump res combo stuff
like that
they've got cables that are all routing
somewhere and in order to hook it all up
in a way that they don't get tangled as
it spins they are routing through a
center chamber and you'll see some
b-roll shots we have that the cables
feeding into that chamber and that's got
a slip ring in it and then there's a
bearing in the base that's sort of like
the same thing you'd use for a high-end
turntable or something like that where
you might be rotating a heavy object for
display
so same type of thing here just the only
really difficult part that had to be
overcome
was making sure the cables don't get all
intertwined as it spins so kind of cool
this is a halo product it's a CES
showcase product far more interesting
than some of the real products we've
seen the show so we're happy about that
if you're wondering about the price the
mock-up was about eight grand and maybe
plus or minus a little bit there but the
production model is TBD so if you're
interested in this you have to let them
know in the comments because otherwise
might not come to market but the
original snowblind it was the same type
of thing where the case was very much
early prototype and there was a lot of
interest in it and so I would power
eventually started making it they have
updated versions here actually have some
footage up as well where the insides not
really cleaned up and certainly look
pretty good so same story there as here
where it there has to be interest
otherwise it just ends up being a
showpiece but very expensive there's no
real tooling for yet no dyes anything
like that this was done mostly by hand
the panels are the easy part here
although they probably took the longest
to put together because it was a years
long process for the snowblind it's just
the interior is is multiple bent steel
sheets so I think if you know the
snowblind you know most of this is just
now it's a cube and and it rotates there
were a few comments we saw or heard
about at least online criticizing
airflow which is always a fair critique
in this one though it's the way it's set
up is the top is is your exhaust in this
current system and then the bottom does
have a giant mesh hole in it so it does
have cutouts for air it's got I think
two to four TS right here and you can
have two 40s in a case without having
air flow it's been done see plenty of I
don't know like fantex cases recently
for example but in this one there's
about an inch gap between the base the
proper base and the rotating cube so
there is hopefully sufficient room for
air we would have to test that to really
know but what you see is not what you
get it's not like this is the only place
the air can come in they can come in
through the bottom too so I ultimately
you don't spend the money on this type
of system if it's going to have a hyper
212 in it so probably not really a
huge deal anyway you can compensate
remotes the airflow with liquid cooling
and it all ultimately would come down to
how they market it if it's marketed as a
high airflow case and obviously that's a
different story
but yeah that's the that's the snowblind
x4 and if you're interested in it you
need to let ibuypower know we can move
on to the revolt 3 I think oh one more
note on the panels so they're 18 point
five inch sixteen by nine and the
resolution is 1366 by 768 which is the
maximum resolution that our power could
source for this panel size and aspect
ratio so just to answer that question
and the video playback engine is
software on the host computer plays back
the video you set in software and an
abstract design like this will work a
bit better because since it's playing
across multiple panels you don't have
any issues with things lining up
properly and then also the biggest
challenge I guess was in the top where
we have some footage of the cabling
dealing with multiple display outputs
from a modern Nvidia card we're kind of
capped at four outputs you have one HDMI
out on most of the r-tx series except
for some of the partner models and
that's a challenge they all go through
an MST and we have shots of how that's
wired up AMD with Eyefinity probably a
bit easier but working with Nvidia here
so let's move on to the revolt 3 that's
the next one it's a smaller case and
it's been updated a bit but still in
prototype stages the revolt 3 is a bit
of a different story from the previous
one because this one will become a
shipping product this is a bit of a
prototype so our understanding is that
due to customs and the government
shutdown it's not fully complete because
they were trying to rush things through
to make sure it got here in time for CES
so some of the stuff like in the
bottling bottom is incomplete like the
mesh that you see down here clearly it's
not going to be just a sheet that you
can depress into the case when it's done
so work in progress but the most
interesting thing here that I wanted to
bring up right away is that you can put
in a mini ITX board and then use a
bifurcation card
so this PCIe bifurcation you plug it
into the slot and then you can get two
cards out and it just split 2 by 16 into
2 by 8 which is pretty interesting the
challenge is that you would need an
abort with nvidia sli certification for
nvidia crossfire doesn't really have as
strict requirements on that end it also
can run with by 4 if you really want it
to sli that requires by 8 and sli
certification
in about there's like a special switch
that gets checked in the motherboard
side so if it doesn't have that it won't
work and that's not on Iowa power that's
gonna be on board vendors but if if
Nvidia will certify a board with a
single slot as absent like capable then
in theory you could insert this plug two
cards in you get two by eight coming out
of a SLIC certification though costs a
whole lot of money it is depending on
how you you purchase it it can be in the
tens of thousands of dollars for the
company so we'll see if that happens
that there would be a board partner that
would need to be willing to go through
that process with NVIDIA and pay the
dues in order to work with IRA power on
that for for this but some companies
have provided special BIOS versions that
bypass some of that in the past so you
might see that either way though the
revolt 3 is the case itself you'll see
some kind of split-level stuff in here
where there's injustice side leg
material there's a split where you can
insert more of these and then there's a
rail system that screws into it and that
allows the height to be somewhat
adjustable while remaining theoretically
stable and and structurally sound so I
mean it's a small case currently has
about a 200 millimeter fan like a 180 in
there as well or 180 radiator down on
the bottom there could be 2 120 s
instead if that route makes more sense
this is still in finalization stages but
the idea is you get tempered glass on a
few sides and hopefully some mesh in the
bottom I think is somewhat the plan
ventilation on the top and then a small
mini ITX form factor and obviously a
very looks oriented build if you wanted
to I guess you could flip it on its side
but that's not really a feature as much
as it is a a consequence of physics so
that's the revote 3 thanks for watching
