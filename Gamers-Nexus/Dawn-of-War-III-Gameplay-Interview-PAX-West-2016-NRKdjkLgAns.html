dotnet and we're here at the dawn of war
three booths at pax was 2016 and joined
by carolina who worked on dawn of war 3
and as a game designer before we get
into the questions this content is
brought to you by I way power and the
new element gaming PC with a full
tempered glass side window LEDs and
basically it's a modified as 340 so
Donna war three obviously this is a
successor I would assume the dawn of war
one and two what can you tell me about
three what's the top level so Donna / 3
is an explosive RTS set in the Warhammer
40k universe and like you said it's the
third iteration in the franchise and
what we're doing is going back to the
what was best and most loved about Donna
bar 1 &amp;amp; dawn of war two and making the
best most over-the-top RTS that we've
ever made so that's back to base
building and large armies I guess and
exactly so in one part we're bringing
back the base building from Donna 41
which was very loved and awesome but
we're also bringing is the heroes that
were so loved and from down at war two
very cool so we saw in the demo we
played there were hero units we had this
guy right here actually so what what can
you tell me about the the races we know
of so far who's going to be in the game
yeah so at lunch we're gonna ship with
elder orcs and space marines and for
heroes we've got gabriel is that right
and who else is in the image demo that
we were looking at so in the demo look
we looked at we actually have them all
here at Gabriel Angelo's the terminators
and Lady Salaria who is one of our super
units and for gameplay so mechanically
this is an RTS what's what's kind of the
basis for resource capture what's what's
the progression of the game mechanically
so what we want you to do in the number
three is basically build
massive army and mix it in what the
heroes that we're giving you a like
Gabriel Angelo's and resources are there
for you to craft a strategy of whether
you want a more infantry focused army or
a more mechanical one where there are
lots of artillery dreadnaughts etc
heroes are there to basically synergize
what they are me in the way that you
build it and use their awesome abilities
to get some s ha no that's we're on
YouTube were allowed to say hey that's
like that ah so for resources I felt
some familiarities with company of
heroes obviously you've deviated from
that a good bit but what are the main
resources were working with here yeah so
resource it says once the players have
known from our previous iterations of
the game so we had requisition which has
focused on infantry and power which is
more focused on enabling you to get
tanks your dreadknots out etc the other
resources basically what we call a lead
points and it's what allows you to
unlock units and drop them into the
field so speaking of driving units into
the field that was one thing when I was
playing I didn't notice this but as the
space marines has actually dropped
capsules right what's the what's the
overview of that yeah so that is def
from above and it's a Space Marines
faction mechanic and so yes you pretty
much bring death onto the battlefield at
whichever point you want so the faction
mechanic is you have three drop pods
that you can load units in to drop them
in the middle of a battle to turn the
tide recon that does that have a like a
kickback or anything when it lands yeah
so when they land they do damage and
knock back what about the crazy giant
laser that you showed me what was that
called how does that work that's the
Space Marine super ability and it's
called orbital bombardment it's
basically a beam of death that falls
from the ships that are monitoring the
battle from above
and they burn everything so this is all
all campaign stuff that we looked at
today obviously there's going to be some
kind of multiplayer is there anything at
all you can tell me about multiplayer
that's not something we're talking about
just yet but I'm excited when would you
tell you more about it very cool so
multiplayer is a thing but we don't know
anything yet what about the release date
tentative release date 2017 yeah great
cool so for more information check out
the links in the description below on
dawn of war three and we'll have
additional coverage for the for you
there got some screenshots and virile as
well let's check the website thank you
for joining me we'll see you all next
