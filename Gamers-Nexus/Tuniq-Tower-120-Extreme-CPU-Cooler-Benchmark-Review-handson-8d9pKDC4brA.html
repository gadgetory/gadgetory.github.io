Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
the - nique tower 120 xtreme CPU cooler
which has extreme in its name so
obviously it's pretty good
this cooler was first released a few
years ago and has become one of the top
rated consumer grade coolers of all time
so I figured that despite its age we'd
review it and use it as an example for
what makes a good cooler in the first
place this video should help underscore
primary elements of CPU coolers that you
should look for when shopping for a new
one so let's get started first of all
the - Niek tower 120 extreme is a fairly
large cooler measuring in at 150
millimetres high 43 millimeters across
and it has a thirty two millimeter
clearance on the underside so low
profile memory and motherboard heat
sinks should fit under it quite easily
the cooler hosted spend centrally rather
than on the outside and uses a 2,000 rpm
magnetic fluid dynamic bearing fan these
bearings should have a longer life and
operate quieter due to their bearing
type the fan can be adjusted by a fan
controller that ships with the cooler
which Scrolls from 1,000 to 2,000 rpm
and of course the only reason to change
the speed would be to reduce noise
though otherwise the CPUs pulse width
modulation should take care of most of
the rpm manipulation it will do that
manually for you or automatically rather
for you if you want to manually control
it 1000 rpm I believe takes the noise
level to less than 20 decibels it might
even be 15 or 16 or 14 I think -
advertises 14 and that's gonna be
quieter than most of your case fans it
most likely so basically at 1,000 rpm
you won't even be able to hear the
cooler
additionally the unit ships with tx3
thermal paste which has a surprisingly
high thermal conductivity for
stock-based at six point three watts per
meter Kelvin as for its build quality
the - nique 120 extreme tower 120
extreme excuse me very long name has a
fin design that is supposed to help the
fan pole air through the unit and set it
out the back hopefully resulting in more
equalized temperatures throughout the
aluminum than with front fan coolers the
heatsink may look massive but keep in
mind that the fan beam in the center
cuts out quite a lot of area for the
frickin that we're conductive material
could be the pipeline for heat flow in
this unit is pretty easy to follow there
are five heat pipes 3/8 millimeter and
two six millimeter which are in direct
contact with the CPU these copper pipes
are connected by a flat and large
surface plate that mounts to the chip
making for better heat dissipation the
surface roughness itself is of course
microscopic as with all units and when
compared to a lot of other units it's
easy to see how large the impact of the
smoother surface the Tunick 120 tends to
have installation is pretty easy if
you're using an LGA 1155 or other recent
socket type you'll need a separate
mounting kit for the cooler to fit your
socket the backplate uses rubberized
washers to help hold the plate in place
while you screw it into the top side
which makes it painless to install in
general however the hard part is
screwing in the thumb screws for the
cooler underneath the massive freaking
cooler you'll probably want to do this
before you mount it in the case and
considering the difficulty of cramming
your hands underneath the 120 extreme
especially in smaller cases as it's sort
of impossible to do without getting cut
a few times so do keep that in mind that
performance is what we're all here for
though and that heat pipe fin design and
unique interior fan positioning has
helped this cooler become a mainstay in
our testing arsenal since 2010 really
and it's still performing admirably we
put it up against our recently reviewed
respire coolers by NZXT and use the
Intel stock cooler as a baseline for
reference first of all we use eight
torture threads with large FFTs on
prime95 to threaten the cores then log
the results with hardware monitor pro by
cpuid and temperatures are all measured
in Delta over ambient C which was 21 C
and you can read more about our testing
methodology in the link in the
description below I ran the test with
stock thermal paste and our control
thermal paste which tests for design and
eliminates thermal conductivity as a
difference between the units when it
comes to thermal paste the techniques
paste is actually higher quality than
our aftermarket stuff so you'll see a
thermal increase for that test
the - nique tower 120 extreme was a
clear winner as you can see in this
graphic with stock thermal paste
performing a for a full two degrees
Celsius I can't talk today apparently a
full two degrees Celsius better than the
T 40 with an additional fan when under
load it's a full 5 Celsius cooler than
the stock T 40 unit without any
additional purchases keep in mind that
our chip is overclocked so it generates
quite a lot of heat meaning the Intel
stock cooler is plainly unable to
adequately cool the chip when under load
it was around 81 C accounting for
ambient with the controlled thermal
compound the T 40 with two fans is the
clear winner and the Tuni cooler comes
in about two C hotter under load though
keep in mind that the technics stock
paste is better performing than this
paste what made the unique so good for
its time though was its excellent heat
pipe and thin design so when shopping
for new coolers keep in mind that you
should care deeply about the number of
exposed heat pipes their diameter the
surface area of the surface roughness
and overall heat sink size the Tower 120
extreme has a mini heat sink on top of
the heat pipes toward the bottom you
remember there was that high riser from
the bottom of the plate that is because
it has a heatsink on it that helps sync
Heat additionally before it even
finishes funneling up to the pipes so
that does help considerably and is not
present on a lot of coolers that are
smaller this is quite big though and
that there is a reason for that so do
keep that in mind when shopping for your
case and that's all for this video I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
