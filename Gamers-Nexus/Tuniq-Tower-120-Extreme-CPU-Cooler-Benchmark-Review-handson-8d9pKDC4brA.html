nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
the two neked our 120 extreme cpu cooler
which has extreme in its name so
obviously it's pretty good this cooler
was first released a few years ago and
has become one of the top-rated consumer
grade coolers of all time so I figured
that despite its age we'd review it and
use it as an example for what makes a
good cooler in the first place this
video should help underscore primary
elements of cpu coolers that you should
look for when shopping for a new one so
let's get started first of all the two
neked our 120 extreme is a fairly large
cooler measuring in at 150 millimetres
high 43 millimeters across and it has a
32 millimeter clearance on the underside
so low profile memory and motherboard
heat sinks should fit under it quite
easily the cooler hosts its fans
centrally rather than on the outside and
uses a 2,000 rpm magnetic fluid dynamic
bearing fan these bearings should have a
longer life and operate quieter due to
their bearing type the fan can be
adjusted by a fan controller that ships
with the cooler which Scrolls from 1000
to 2000 rpm and of course the only
reason to change the speed would be to
reduce noise though otherwise the CPUs
pulse width modulation should take care
of most of the RPM manipulation it will
do that manually for you or
automatically rather for you if you want
to manually control it 1000 rpm I
believe takes the noise level to less
than 20 decibels it might even be 15 or
16 or 14 I think to advertise those 14
and that's going to be quieter than most
of your case fans it most likely so
basically at 1000 rpm you won't even be
able to hear the cooler additionally the
unit ships with tx3 thermal paste which
has a surprisingly high thermal
conductivity for stock-based at 6.3
watts per meter kelvin as for its build
quality the two nique 120 extreme tower
120 extreme excuse me very long name has
a fin design that is supposed to help
the fan poll air through the unit and
set it out the back hopefully resulting
in more equalized temperatures
throughout the aluminum than with front
fan coolers the heatsink may look
massive but keep in mind that the fan
being in the center cuts out quite a lot
of area for the
freakin that we're conductive material
could be the pipeline for heat flow in
this unit is pretty easy to follow there
are five heat pipes three eight
millimeter and two six millimeter which
are in direct contact with the CPU these
copper pipes are connected by a flat and
large surface plate that mounts to the
chip making for better heat dissipation
the surface roughness itself is of
course microscopic as with all units and
when compared to a lot of other units
it's easy to see how large the impact of
the smoother surface the tunic 120 tends
to have installation is pretty easy if
you're using an LGA 1155 or other recent
socket type you'll need a separate
mounting kit for the cooler to fit your
socket the backplate uses rubberized
washers to help hold the plate in place
while you screw it into the top side
which makes it painless to install in
general however the hard part is
screwing in the thumb screws for the
cooler underneath the massive freaking
cooler you'll probably want to do this
before you mount it in the case and I
considering the difficulty of cramming
your hands underneath the 120 extreme
especially in smaller cases as it's sort
of impossible to do without getting cut
a few times so do keep that in mind the
performance is what we're all here for
though and that heat pipe thin design
and unique interior fan positioning has
helped this cooler become a mainstay in
our testing arsenal since 2010 really
and it's still performing admirably we
put it up against our recently reviewed
respire coolers by NZXT and use the
intel stock cooler as a baseline for
reference first of all we use eight
torture threads with large f of TS on
prime 95 to threaten the cores then
logged results with a hardware monitor
pro by CPUID and temperatures are all
measured in delta over ambient c which
is 21 c and you can read more about our
testing methodology in the link in the
description below I ran the test with
stock thermal paste and our control
thermal paste which tests for design and
eliminates thermal conductivity as a
difference between the units when it
comes to thermal paste their techniques
paste is actually higher quality than
our aftermarket stuff so you'll see a
thermal increase for that test
the two neked our 120 extreme was a
clear winner as you can see in this
graphic with stock thermal paste
performing a for a full 2 degrees
Celsius I can't talk today apparently a
full 2 degrees Celsius better than the T
40 with an additional fan when under
load it's a full 5 Celsius cooler than
the stock t40 unit without any
additional purchases keep in mind that
our chip is overclocked so it generates
quite a lot of heat meaning the intel
stock cooler is plainly unable to
adequately cool the chip when under load
it was around 81 c accounting for
ambient with the controlled thermal
compound the t 40 with two fans is the
clear winner and the tuna cooler comes
in about to see hotter under load though
keep in mind that the two niques stock
paste is better performing than this
paste what made the unique so good for
its time though was its excellent heat
pipe and thin design so when shopping
for new coolers keep in mind that you
should care deeply about the number of
exposed heat pipes their diameter the
surface area of the surface roughness
and overall heat sink size the tower 120
extreme has a mini heatsink on top of
the heat pipes toward the bottom you
remember there was that high riser from
the bottom of the plate that is because
it has a heatsink on it that helps sink
heat additionally before it even
finishes funneling up to the pipes so
that does help considerably and is not
present on a lot of coolers that are
smaller this is quite big though and
that there's a reason for that so do
keep that in mind when shopping for your
case and that's all for this video I'll
see you all next time p</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
