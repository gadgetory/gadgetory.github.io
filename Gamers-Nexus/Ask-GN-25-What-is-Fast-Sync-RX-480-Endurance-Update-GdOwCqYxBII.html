of ask a GN as always leave your
questions in the comments below if you
want them to be addressed next video if
we can get to them hopefully and one
quick request here if anyone's got not
GPU questions that would be great
because we're doing all video card
content and going a little crazy so if
you have a not video card question
please post it below cooling cases CPUs
I don't care anything so first all
before getting to contact this video
this episode is brought to you by MSI
and their GTX 1060 gaming X video card
which comes with the twin froze or
cooler so first question is from I don't
know how to promise this button it a
hime who says I have a 1080 and recently
discovered at fast sink I have a 60
Hertz ultra wide and my fps is usually
between 60 to 80 in games I play should
I turn it on or wait what should I turn
fast sync on okay should I turn fast
sync on does G sync
what does G sync solve that fast ink
doesn't and why should anyone by G sync
if there is vsync without stuttering or
latency so there's three solutions here
we're talking I'm not going to address
free sync here just because a3 is
frankly enough to go over well maybe
talk about freezing someone post a
question but specifically looking at
vsync g-sync and fast ink these things
been around forever
G sync is the physical module that's
placed on your monitor and then fast
sync is the new solution that's an
Nvidia drivers which began shipping with
the GT X 1080 Pascal cards I think we
talked out it's super briefly in a
previous article or video but I did not
go into death so we can certainly talk
with that first of all vsync is we have
talked about this in previous videos if
you look up what is G sync we talked
about it but very briefly vsync sort of
chokes the game engine so if you're say
your refresh rate 60 Hertz vsync will
make it so that if your framerate output
is above 60 fps it will drag it down to
60 and then every X
milliseconds 16 milliseconds with a 60
Hertz display every 16 milliseconds
there will be a frame that goes to the
display so you have no tearing and
tearing is when as a frame is drawn
vertically because it refreshes
vertically as a frame is drawn another
frame comes in the pipe and starts
drawing as well so you get a tear which
is basically like if you've ever seen
sort of a a character or a tree or some
vertical object is the best example
where you'll see it kind of if it's like
this normally and then the next half the
frame gets drawn you'll see them like
that so the tree is now sort of torn ie
in essence tearing so so that's what
tearing is and vsync solves that by
choking back the frame rate to match
exactly the monitor and the refresh rate
but you can potentially introduce
stuttering with vsync on so there's two
different terms here tearing and
stuttering they're not the same thing
tearing is what I just described or the
visual the image itself looks torn
because multiple frames are coming in
potentially hit in the screen at the
same time these are called runts when
you have sort of short pieces of frames
or fragments so these ruts come in you
get tearing the alternative is when you
have vsync on you get stuttering
stuttering as if your frame rate falls
below the target 60 Hertz in this kind
of example you fall below the 60 Hertz
target and now your frame rate output is
such that if you sort of miss that 16
millisecond timer because 60 Hertz I was
16 milliseconds for each frame you
missed that timer then it will redraw
the previous frame so that's a stutter
that's when basically there's missing
data and so this is why a lot of gamers
especially in competitive fields prefer
no vsync to vsync because they sort of
rather have the torn frames and have all
the information and then just kind of
mentally calculate the difference it's
not really its second nature to all of
us at this point as opposed to missing
data
so that's vsync g-sync solves that which
we explained in our what does do you
think video to answer this question fast
ink is a new one so fast ink decouples
the render pipeline and the display
hardware
and so the game engine acts as if vsync
is off so it acts like it's off that
means it's pushing as many frames as it
possibly can as they're created rather
than eliminating like vsync would do
wear it back pressures and this
eliminates that back pressure with fast
sync and it lowers latency but Tarin is
still removed so how does that happen if
it's not you've got no vsync and you
have no G sync but there's no tearing
either and that's done because fast sync
will choose frames to send to the
display based on what it thinks will
look best and so the entire frame is
saved and displayed rather than frame
fragments and runs like I explained
previously so it just it picks an entire
frame and outputs it and that's what
fast ink is so hopefully that answers
that question the next question John
Jacobson asks will buying a card like
the Strix guarantee you get a higher bin
to GPU than what you would in a cheaper
card is it the cooler that makes the
price difference generally cooler is
what makes the price difference and pre
over clocks and sometimes other software
features and things like that or
warranties but generally the cooler is
what makes a difference and then in
terms of bending there's no guarantee
from it there there are certain brands
and models of those brands that will be
bend the kingpin cards are a good
example of something that's really
expensive but they do been out the
better chips so that's one sort of model
where you do get bending some of the
high-end gigabyte cards are Bend and
most of the brands and AIB partners do
have a high-end model and they will do
some bending you need to look and see if
they advertise that but just being Strix
doesn't necessarily mean it's been just
being SSC doesn't necessarily mean it's
Bend all it means is that they've pre
overclocked it to whatever value and
there's a cooler on it so unless they're
explicitly saying with whatever Strix
you're looking at that it's Bend the
answer is probably no but it may still
be pre overclocked anyway because pre
overclocking normally is not that
extreme from the fact
it can be generally pulled off on the
average chip for that GPU next question
is from Tuck allude to chaloo who says I
questioned our vishaya chips still worth
getting should I wait for his n I would
say just like Harriet definitively don't
buy f/x chips right now it doesn't make
sense
the platform is ancient it's a 2011
platform I think am3+ I think that's
2011 and through his 2009 I'm pretty
sure
so that's old that's pre USB 3 the USB 3
on these platforms is controlled by a
separate controller that's been added to
the board it's not natively supported by
the chipset same is through true for
PCIe gen3 and there's some stability
issues on some of these boards sure
someone worked fine I'm sure many of you
will comment and say how perfectly yours
runs but if you're building a new system
today I would really not recommend FX
because it's it's just old at this point
you either buy a current gen Intel or
last gen Intel's even fine that makes
sense or an FM 2 plus CPU if you're kind
of lower end and you want to buy like an
X for 80k is a good chip or 860 or a 45
they're all good chips for their price
range those are fine I would not buy FX
I would wait for either Zen or buy
something if you need it now in one of
those lines I just mentioned x4 or the
Intel lineups depend on your price range
but FX definitely is it's just as I mean
it just feels kind of weird at this
point to buy something that's got an
architecture that old when there's one
months away potentially if the schedule
is stuck to and it's also got some
stability issues depend on which chip
you buy the 9000 series and in my
experience has not been a great
performer with everyday computing if you
get a board that's and then supports our
problem if you get a board that has vrm
issues or whatever so I'd avoid it's
it's too too much hassle right now for
an
product when there's better stuff out
there for basically the same price and
that's the biggest thing last question
is or well yeah last question before I
have an endurance test update is from
Gert dr. who says does this actually
good question does the quality of the
PSU affect max overclocking potential
instability a few months ago I swapped
out a secondhand bronze that I think was
tier 3 with a nicer gold PSU and I was
able to hit a higher stable CPU GPU
overclock than when he's in the previous
power supply answer is yes so that's not
a fluke that you saw that difference
power supplies affect a lot of things
but the main thing with overclocking is
voltage delivery so a really cheap power
supply there's a few different issues
that can possibly pop up but the one
we'll focus on is V Group voltage droop
so any voltage throughput it's not gonna
be a flat line voltage throughput it's
always a little bit spiky but reducing
that spike enos is important and the
good power supplies will do this and if
you've got a PSU that has more V droop
what will happen is your clock rate will
suddenly take a hit if it gets a voltage
that it's not expecting or demanding and
that's where you see a diminished
stability in terms of your potential
maximum overclock so a higher end power
supply there are diminishing returns of
course but a higher end power supply for
the average overclock would
theoretically allow you to get a higher
OC than something like a $30.00 Diablo
tech PSU and so the short answer is yes
v group is a big factor and then over
current protection things like that are
also big factors if you have a if you
get really serious about overclocking
over current protection will actually
genuinely protect your components the
board CP whatever
if something's something screwy and
there especially be doing in volt mods
or hard mods but that's a short answer
that one the last thing I wanted to
bring up is the endurance test so we
started that our X 480 endurance test
not long ago and I have run the test is
that it's an interesting problem because
we haven't collected this much day
for something ever so I've got dozens of
files that are six hours in encapture
length and that is hundreds of thousands
of cells in a spreadsheet so I'm trying
to figure out how to process it without
having issues Google sheets can't do it
I have local software now that's doing
it like actual software not on the
internet and that's working okay now I
need to figure out how to display the
data the I haven't crunched it all yet
but the short sort of preview is we
didn't really see any issues the
motherboards fine it still works so the
are X 480 I'm 16000 6.2 with the
overdraw through the PCIe bus as it
appears right now before crunching the
data does not appear to have hurt the
motherboard in a substantial fashion
from the week or so burnin that was run
but that's not that's not a definitive
statement it's just kind of a preview I
think you would need it an even cheaper
motherboard or something out of spec and
- maybe for something super cheap that
doesn't make any sense would have issues
but we're not seeing issues on this one
so that's a very quick update we'll get
a video online as soon as I can figure
out the presentation of data and stuff
like that but that's all for this time
