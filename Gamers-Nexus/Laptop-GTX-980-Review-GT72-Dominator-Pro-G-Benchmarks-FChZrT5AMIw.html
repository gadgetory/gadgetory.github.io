access net and today we're talking about
MSI's new gt72 Dominator Pro G laptop
quite a name but the reason this is
interesting for those of you who might
not be looking at a laptop is because it
has the GTX 980 in it so this is not a
gtx 980m it is the full desktop gtx 980
including the GM 204 GPU with really
nothing disabled same TM use same ROPS
same cuda cores all that stuff is pretty
much the same there are a couple of
differences but we'll talk about those
where they exist in a moment but this is
the gt72 Dominator Pro it has the GTX
980 in it brand new in notebooks and
that is quite a move from the gtx 980m
and we'll talk about that more
momentarily as well now the driving
factor for the disparity between desktop
GPUs and mobile GPUs has been thermals
you're cramming a lot of stuff into a
small space and even though this laptop
in particular is a 2 inch thick sort of
beast of a thing it's a desktop
replacement ultimately that's still a
small space to cram high-end hardware
into so thermals are your main concern
there's a concern with the entropy you
have a lot of heat generating in a tight
space it just sort of devolves into
chaos as it builds upon itself that's
why you see some of the notebooks like
I'm sure many of you have had
experiences or have friends who've had
experiences where you'll have to reflow
solder or reflow thermal paste to apply
new thermal paste to cracked or worn
compound on notebook GPUs that stuff
happens because it gets so hot inside of
the chassis with a traditional notebook
cooler you normally have a fairly simple
system of an aluminum cold plate maybe
two of them one on the GPU one on the
CPU and then that runs in a lot that
I've seen a single heat pipe made of
copper often from the two cold plates
and those connect to a single fan which
dissipates the heat as it generates from
the cold plates which are attached to
the actual die of the CPU or the GPU and
that heat of course gets transferred
into the aluminum fins dissipated by a
fan and so forth that is a fairly
limited system and
with a desktop setup even with it just
the GPU the video card itself in a
desktop you have a lot more cooling
potential so that's been the limiter and
to give you an idea of what that
difference has been the GTX 980 and
desktops is about 30% faster than the
980m so why does that happen well it's
because of those thermals and Vidia
specifically with a 9 ATM reduced some
of the complexity of the GPU it's still
a GM 204 GPU but instead of the GTX 980
where you've got more than 2,000 cores
the 9 ATM has around 1,500 cores so a
lot has been removed there and that sort
of corresponds with the 35-ish percent
Delta that we've seen in our tests so
that's where the limiter is let's talk
about the specs on the GTX 980 9 ATM for
comparison and then look over the laptop
specs and then we'll do the benchmarks
looking at the specs for the GPU itself
the msi gt72 that we're looking at here
has the GTX 980 GPU in it we have
another gt72 with a 9 ATM you can see
both of the specs compared to this chart
that's what we're testing in the FPS
benchmarks and thermal benchmarks in a
moment the GTX 980 in the new laptop
which is priced at $3,100 has 2048 cuda
cores versus 1536 cuda cores in the 980m
quite a difference and then the base
clock of a traditional reference gtx 980
as found in desktops is 1126 megahertz
with the boost at 1216 megahertz that is
the reference so we're not comparing
non-reference aftermarket cards here
we're just looking at reference against
the laptops and the MSI laptop is a
slightly different clock but it's around
there the gtx 980m for comparison is a
1038 megahertz
base clock and a and 11:27 megahertz of
boost so that is a fair difference
almost 100 megahertz on the boost which
is I actually noticed one gaming the GTX
980 in the notebook transfer is 144 Giga
texels per second just like its desktop
counterpart it's got 128 TM use 64 ROPS
and the memory spec in the laptop is
similar to the desktop version but it's
got one main item that's different and
that is the OEM can decide if it's 4
gigabytes or 8 gigabytes of gddr5
whereas the desktop version is just 4
gigabytes flat in terms of the laptop
specifications our model 4 review has a
17.3 inch 1080p display is about 2
inches thick at its fattest and has a 75
Hertz g-sync display in that 17.3 inch
space so the item here to note of course
is that it's got G sync that's still new
to laptops and it's 75 Hertz so what
that gives you a bit more FPS than 60
the CPU is an i7 68 20 HK skylake CPU
that has some overclocking ability
within a very basic BIOS our model has
32 gigabytes of ddr4 21 33 megahertz
it's got an RGB keyboard by SteelSeries
a subwoofer in the underside of the
laptop which is pretty interesting but
common in these larger sized laptops has
speakers in the top of the keyboard area
just above that powered by Dynaudio and
then LEDs in the back of the case or the
enclosure rather for the eye of the
Dragon we'll call it the laptop costs
$3,100 and for comparison the gt72 980m
cost about $2,100 announced spec so
that's a $1,000 difference just to get
the 980 desktop version there are a few
other changes like the skylake CPU and
some of the other the memory specs a
little different but in general your
2100 to 2500 for a comparable 980m
version of this laptop and you have 30
149 80 version so that's the big news
the 980 is technically an MX M card but
it is strongly recommended both by us
and by people who actually make these
systems not to just swap around MXM
cards without careful consideration
because the laptops are all very
carefully designed for what they're
shipped with so do keep that in mind the
big news with the GTX 980 in the laptop
is that it is fully overclocked and
supported so well
almost folly anyway the main difference
here between this and the 980m
you can overclock both you can overclock
some AMD GPUs in notebooks but the 980
desktop GPU as found in this GT 72 is
fairly open in terms of clock rates for
both the core clock and the memory clock
and we test that later on the one place
you're limited is voltage so you cannot
currently control the voltage for the
GPU this is something that NVIDIA has
considered but we're not clear on
whether that is coming just yet
the fan control you are able to set a
custom fan curve which is pretty
important if you want a smoother thermal
graph as we'll show you in a bit
but for purposes of this review we were
not given access to a fan control
configurator just yet that is something
msi is working on but was not done with
that time of this review so keep that in
mind other than this VRMs for the 980 I
found in notebooks are expect to be
between four and eight phases for
comparison most notebooks are about
three phases for the BRM on the GPU and
that means that speaking to overclocking
with four to eight phases even at four
you've got a lot more room to play with
the frequency and the voltage even
though the voltage is locked for us it
still needs to be cleaned at the 1.1 ish
bolts that it pushes when testing
thermal design in this laptop is pretty
open because it is a large enclosure so
that's the main advantage you get with
something that's big it's a lot less
portable it becomes a desktop
replacement you don't necessarily want
to take it on a plane you can't use it
on a plane because it's so big but the
thermals are way more open so we have
big heat sinks as you can see here
blacked-out pipes that are probably
copper and a dual fan setup which
intakes from the bottom and exhausts out
the back so you definitely cannot have
this on a surface that conforms to the
underside of the laptop because you will
suffocate those fans keep that in mind
it basically needs to be on a desk or a
flat surface the heat mostly exhausts
out of the back which is mostly a good
thing you don't want it exhausting at
the bottom it just gets stuck in there
and then the CPU and GPU have
independent cold plates which are or at
least appear to be aluminum here's a
look at the thermal benchmark the first
chart shows thermals over time and the
unit with the 980 that would be the one
we're looking at here runs noticeably
hotter the wavy effect that you're
seeing in the form here on the chart it
kind of looks like a wave form but it's
not is because of the automatic fan
control so you see it on both of them
that's because the fan ramps up and down
based on demand because we don't have
direct control over the fans at this
time but that is apparently coming in
the future equilibrium
puts us at fifty four point seven for
Celsius for the 980m
sixty three point four five Celsius for
the 980 in the laptop and a reference of
61 point four Celsius for the desktop
gtx 980 so just slightly cooler than the
laptop version though obviously your
cooling configuration matters here there
are a lot of testing concerns with the
setup like this and we've taken those
into account for the desktop two laptop
comparison the main one is you want to
run not necessarily a clock for clock
you don't have to do that but you want
the frequency to be as close as possible
with the CPUs and the architecture
doesn't have to be identical it is okay
to deviate from that as long as they're
similar so we're running a 4790k versus
the i7 skylake cpu in this one they're
both i7s they're both hyper threaded
four cores eight threads that's very
important they have pretty close to the
same frequency for the clock rate and
then we disable turbo boost on the
desktop version for important testing
and validation reasons the other item to
look for here is GPU bound games so
because we're trying to compare the GPUs
we don't want to look at CPU bound games
often RTS games top-down strategy or
world building games things like that
Starcraft is a good example grid
Autosport is also somewhat CPU bound so
we eliminate those games do a strict GPU
to GPU comparison jumping into the
benchmarks game saw about a twenty to
twenty nine percent gain over the nine
ATM and about a five to ten percent loss
against the desktop and GTX at nine
eighty which is really not bad dirt
rally the GTX 980 laptop is that
85 FPS versus 980m laptops 66 FPS so
that's quite a difference and enough to
jump to 1440 with some settings tweaks
if you have a GTX 980 laptop that
supports it this one does not
you could run DSR if you wanted to but
that's the the room to play that we're
given here you will be happy with a 980
m at this fps of course that sounded
very forceful you will be happy but at
66 fps it's pretty hard to complain
especially on a laptop so yeah there's a
difference but it's not enough to really
change the world with dirt rally for
Metro last light it's 77 vs. 57 FPS
average which is a 29.8 5 percent gain
over the nine ATM and the desktop
performs 7.5% faster than the notebook
980 at 83 FPS with slightly better lows
1% and 0.1% lows GTA 5 we see
seventy-nine FPS versus 57 FPS which are
actually huge gains in this case it's
it's starting to become very noticeable
especially for the 1% lows at 52 verses
38 fps and that means you're gonna have
less noticeable dips and drops and
framerate when you're playing so that is
actually a fairly important metric that
is a 32.4% difference Delta over the 9
ATM and that's important if you want to
use the more advanced settings which we
did not use the Advanced Settings tab
for this we just use the normal graphics
tab and if you want to use mods then
it's helpful there - there's a 6.1 for
4% disparity against the 980 which sits
at 84 FPS The Witcher 3 at 56 FPS versus
39 FPS on the 9 ATM again shows a
difference and this is the biggest
difference in terms of playability
between the two laptops at 39 fps you're
not gonna have a great time playing you
can force it but you'll want to drop the
settings at 56 fps you're really close
to that magical 60 FPS mark for
playability and fluidity of the
framerate so that does make a noticeable
difference and you can probably drop one
setting to get to 60 if you really
wanted but 56 is certainly playable on
the witcher 3 with the desktop we see a
61 FPS which is an 8 point 5 5 %
over the laptop 980 here's our
overclocking chart the final OC was plus
200 megahertz offset which put us at
1405 megahertz core clock and we had an
80 megahertz memory offset that put us
at 35 80 megahertz here are the charts
showing that difference in the real
world so you can look at some of the
benchmarks here in some instances we see
the overclock was actually enough to
overtake the reference of 980 and that's
obviously because the 980 is reference
so if we used an aftermarket 980 by any
of the Adam board partners it would
outperform and all these tests if we
overclock the reference IBM desktop it
would outperform but this just gives you
an idea of where the laptop 980 Falls
and what it is capable of in terms of
fps and performance battery tests are on
the website and that is linked below in
the article but we saw a little over an
hour of battery life with the gt72
Dominator pro g1 gaming certainly not
bad and very similar to the GT 72 with a
9 ATM so that speaks to the efficiency
of the new unit there's a bit of a
difference but not much of one generally
though you're going to want to be
plugged into the wall because when
you're on battery it instantly tanks the
FPS and that is by design that's to draw
less power from the GPU you're not gonna
do any overclocking without the battery
plugged in because of this difference
but that's just that's how it works with
really any laptop that's not specific to
this model so talking about value then
the performance of the laptop in terms
of FPS is very impressive the thermals
of it less so at 10 see warmer than the
gtx 980m
but still reasonable and within
usability it is pretty warm though and
in the smaller units you're not going to
have as much overclock and Headroom as
we have in this one because of the
thermal limitation in terms of gaming
performance the GTX 980 performs
basically how the desktop version does
so that's fairly true to the marketing
at least it's a five to ten percent
Delta on average sitting around seven to
eight percent for the real-world impact
on fps between the desktop and the
laptop gtx 980 and in terms of actual
framerate output against the 980 m in
particular that puts you generally
enough FPS over to play the same
settings
so for a lot of the games like for dirt
rally and for other not so intensive
games you are not going to get a big
enough of an FPS hike to change how
you're playing that game now if you're
playing games like The Witcher 3 or GTA
5 that changes because those games are a
lot more intensive especially on the GPU
so in these instances especially The
Witcher 3 or similar games you're
getting enough of an FPS hike from the
non-m version of this GPU to increase
your settings that quite a bit in some
instances going from 40 fps and the 980
m to almost 60 on the 980 what's the
witcher 3 and ultra and 1080 and then
for the laptops that strip with the 980
and 1440 or 4k display options that also
something to factor in the 980 m is not
really capable of supporting those at
gaming tasks and neither is the 980 for
most games but for some again dirt rally
you could play at 1440 with this thing
not gonna play the witcher at 4040 with
it or if you do you're dropping down to
like Lua settings or comparable at which
point why bother but some games like
dirt rally grid Autosport civilization
games that kind of stuff you can play at
the higher resolutions with a gtx 980m a
notebook at the end of the day though
it's $3,100 for this and you can buy the
980 m version for 21 to 2500 depending
on spec and that's gonna be good enough
to give you a pretty good time gaming if
you're willing to sacrifice some of your
settings if you're not willing to
sacrifice settings there's your answer
but if you are I'd still suggest looking
at the 980 m at laptops for those of you
who are production users I did not do
adobe premiere test or anything like
that I can tell you for a fact from our
own internal testing that you see about
a 3x again when using cuda enabled
processing on a 980 m against just the
cpu so if there's any consideration at
all as to whether you should get a
notebook that is capable of doing some
form of CUDA acceleration for a
workstation task then the answer is yes
you probably should whether or not you
get the 980 or the 980 m is going to
depend on budget and how serious you are
about that production if you're getting
paid for it stuff like that now the big
differentiating factor that Nvidia is
keen to remind everyone
is virtual reality and that's a use case
we're not really considering too heavily
here because we're mostly advocating for
consumers but for those who are doing
any type of virtual reality demo station
if your exodia night conventions or if
you just want to take one around for
land events or to play with friends then
you will need a desktop GPU to really do
anything with that that's that's
reasonable and that's where the 980 in
the notebook does actually have a very
large difference against the 980 m and
that's where I would steer you toward
this Rishta 980 m at the end of the day
performance is very good here thermals
are reasonable but not great or bad
really and the price is not unfair but
it's expensive so the things to consider
here do you need a notebook if not build
a desktop or even buy one and it's gonna
be cheaper about the same power or
slightly more powerful depending on what
you spec it with if it's a 980 it's
about the same slightly better in some
instances and if you do need a notebook
then consider how much do you really
care about ultra settings or is as high
or very high and if the answer is you
care a lot it's it's the 980 something
with a 980 in it the GT 72 is certainly
fine read the full review for specific
