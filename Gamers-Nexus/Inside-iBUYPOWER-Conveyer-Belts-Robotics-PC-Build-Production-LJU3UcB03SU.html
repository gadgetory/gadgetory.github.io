Donna and we are here in I by powers
assembly facilities behind me I have a
very expensive wall of video cards 290
X's 295x2 is to 80s this is all the AMD
stuff there's a man video stuff over
there as well and this is sort of the
the beginning of the process for when
you order a system through one of these
sis or at least specifically iBUYPOWER
they come to the parts room collect all
the parts and then it heads over toward
the the assembly line area where they
actually build the system and we'll jump
over there and show you that now so for
step two of the process we are here in
the assembly area this is where someone
would be seated actually building the
system there boxes of parts all around
me those are the part it's sort of like
think of it like a restaurant where they
get a ticket with your order and then
they collect all the parts start putting
it in the box and build it just like any
other system build iBUYPOWER turns out
I'm told a couple hundred systems a day
so this is just step two of the process
there's some conveyor belts going on
where it moves over to the testing and
burnin facility and that's where we're
going next in this area I by power is
pixie boot into Windows or installing
Windows and that is done pretty easily
actually we do it in our own testing for
GPUs you basically have a server that
hosts images for windows including
drivers software things like that and
you can load all these hard drives over
Ethernet very quickly to be ready to
boot don't need to do any driver
installs post windows install because
it's all imaged over the network so that
is the pixie boot area and then we've
got some sunburn and stuff to check out
next so here I my power is using a
custom version of fur mark as you can
see their logo is up here in the fur
where the big fur ball normally goes
that is the custom firm arc for their
burnin and this runs for about half an
hour just judging on the nine percent
performance at a couple minutes in and
we are currently testing it looks like
in our seven two hundred series GPU in
this system so that runs just to make
sure it's stable make sure it's all good
and that it's basically ready to ship to
you and this is one of the final
processes of the ibuypower build and
shipping assembly area it is the actual
machine that's just doing all the
packing tape so the box comes through
puts a bunch of tape on there sends it
down the line as you'll see
our b-roll or the camera was sitting on
a box and and then it goes out the ship
so that is the iy power assembly area
here in California this is all done in
California locally check out the
description below for more information
and I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
