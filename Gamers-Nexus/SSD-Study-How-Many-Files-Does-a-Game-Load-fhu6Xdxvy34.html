Nexus dotnet and today we're talking
about game file i/o or input/output as
it pertains to your SSD or hard drive or
your other storage device so when I say
game file i/o what I mean is what type
of files in terms of size our games are
loading how big those files are how many
they're loading and what that means in
terms of the performance you should be
looking for in your drive or whether
that's an SSD or a hard drive and what
it means in terms of how optimization is
for modern games so just a bit of
background I did a full test on this it
was mostly an experiment for internal
testing so I could build a test
methodology for SSDs but I wanted to
publish it because I think it's really
cool information you can't do
necessarily a whole lot with this it's
sort of just cool to know but it will
inform you how to select the drive in
the future so let's let's look at the
methodology here I use this program
called HD tune Pro and it is currently
logging the active file transfer is
going on on my system and there are
actually a lot of them you can see this
is the activity graph here and this is
the block size or the actual size of the
files being moved around from and to the
disk and reads and writes and what it's
doing right now is mostly measuring
transactions with Windows that's going
to be log files caching temporary files
because I'm not actually actively doing
anything with this computer but it's got
browsers open those might be caching
things there might be temporary files
windows itself creates and stores a log
file for error checking and it's got all
kinds of event managers so there's
constantly data being written to and
read from your device and this is
important to know because with an SSD
you have a life span and yes it is very
long in general its measured in program
llores cycles or p/e cycles and
generally it's something like 3000 for
an mlc SSD if you don't know what that
means check the links in the description
below but over time you're going to be
writing a lot of data to it especially
if you leave your computer on all the
time this probably won't impact the vast
majority of you your systems usable life
will be depleted long before your drive
is depleted so don't panic and start
training your system off all the time
just for that reason
turn it off maybe for other reasons like
power consumption but just good stuff to
know so constantly Windows is doing
things in the background whether or not
you want it to which is the nature of
Windows is it not I use this tool to
measure games so I would launch I
launched five games I launched watchdogs
titanfall battlefield 4 grid Autosport
and Metro last light which is a very
popular benchmarking tool for GPUs and
other hardware using these games I
tested and using HP tune I tested how
long they take to launch and what types
of files they're loading during launch
or rather what size of files not what
type but what size files they load
during launch and what size files they
run read and write during gameplay and
we will call reading and writing
collectively IO transactions or
accessing pretty plainly and looking at
all this with the tool running I can see
that as an example here just in the
background right now we've got a heavy
amount of 4k read going on we've got a
heavy amount this is less than 64 K the
big bar means everything less than 64 K
we have very little greater than 64 K
and we have a lot in the 8k to 32 K
range that's just Windows now looking at
a game I actually ran these benchmarks
they're pretty extensive and you can see
this is the game play when you're
actually playing a game reads so every
read that your SSD is doing meaning
every file for titanfall or whatever
it's it's calling for that file
programmatically it grabs it it reads it
it tells the CPU or the RAM or whatever
whatever it wants to know maybe it sends
it over to the GPU if it's a texture
file and then that's considered a Reed &amp;amp;
Reed's are measured generally from 0.5 K
or 512 bytes up to 1 K 2 K 4 K that's
kilobytes by the way 8 K 16 K 32k 64 and
greater than 64 and what I have here is
a percentage breakdown because looking
at the file by file breakdown it's it's
very it's a skewed chart but you can see
a very big table of how many files in my
full
article below so what we see here the
big one just to address the one jumping
out at everyone that big yellow line is
Metro last light so that is Metro and
this is specifically the 32k file reads
that Metro does Metro actually reads
more than ten thousand files for its
benchmark test when you run it three
times in a row at least so maybe it's
more like three thousand per test but
that was ten thousand for six minutes of
gameplay with Metro and it reads a bit
less when you're doing loading when you
load the software but it's it's still a
lot so 32k is very popular now what I
want to address here the reason you care
about these numbers is because an SST
reviews you will see two things you will
see sequential read and write and you
will see random read and write random is
almost always every name a website it is
almost always measured in 4k random and
what that means is that it's simulating
a real-world environment basically the
the tests the reviewers the testers and
the SSD companies and heart and hard
drive companies back in the old days all
got together and sort of independently
tested it they said okay it looks like
4k is the most common file size in a
Windows or application environment so we
will use 4k random for testing drives
random is important because that is the
type of data it's moving around we don't
necessarily know what it wants or when
it wants it just at some point Windows
or the game will want a 4k file so that
is why 4k is always tested in SSD
reviews my purpose here was to see is
that still true does it matter for you
if you're a gamer
as you can see 32k is very popular now
as is 16k and part of that is the games
industry changing part of that is just
because games are different and normally
lesser optimized on a lot of other
software especially windows because if
we switch back here to HD tune Pro which
is running in Windows you can still see
it's almost all 4k it's been running now
for eat and a half minutes almost all 4k
reads with some rights and a lot of 16k
rights so what we learned from this
chart is that games like 32k 16k they
still like for just not quite as much as
you might expect
what that means is he shouldn't read too
far into the 4k random tests and perhaps
look at sites like ours which in the
future will be running these more real
world gaming synthetic gaming tests
where we look at the 32 K and 16 K
performance of SSD is not just 4k now
scrolling down or on in the video just
switching the slide we can see right
performance this is a lot different it's
a lot more normalized in writes it's
still very populated in 4k files part of
that is because it's just a very
efficient file size from a game
developer or application designer
perspective you can fit a lot into 4k
especially depending on your compression
and I it's good for hard drives which is
what a lot of stuff was originally built
for and still built for just based on a
hard drive transaction speeds and
allocation size so we have a lot that's
still greater than 64 K my guess is that
these files are probably your savegame
files so what the watchdog's save game
file is pretty big and it might also be
for other things like log files if they
save any kind of recording of the match
in the background that's what that would
be so generally this is a very unpopular
size for reads unless you're playing a
movie right it's it seems to be more
common in games and perhaps for those
reasons I listed so those are the
popular sizes there let's look at the
actual amount of files we'll skip over
to that and you can see all this in my
article below now the amount of files
for the reads and writes I just talked
about in your game meanwhile gaming
including your level loads and your cell
transitions what we're doing is reading
let's see the most we read is Metro last
light at ten thousand two hundred and
ninety four files that are smaller than
64 K this does not count greater than
that size it's writing eleven hundred
files that's a lot of files to move
around during your gameplay so in Metro
last light you're actually much more
likely to have a storage bottleneck than
in other games for this reason as for
whether you'll see that that's tough to
say because a lot of those files are
gonna be during the level load which I
said is included in this
so you're calling a lot of those before
you actually see it on the screen what
that means is that with a solid-state
drive and we all know this already it's
going to load the level faster because
simply you can move like 10 times faster
if not more right so it quick that's
disclaimer any solid-state drive doesn't
matter what it is as long as it's a
reasonable solid-state drive and not a
hard drive you're almost definitely not
gonna notice a speed difference between
SSDs if you plug in a 3k HyperX SSD and
then you plug in some really high-end
Samsung drive like an 840 pro I would
put money down that 99% of users will
not be able to tell the difference in
loading a level in a game they'll be
able to tell differences in encryption
time and in Adobe premier and code time
and things like that gaming not so much
so don't take this too crazy right it's
just it's really just a cool information
thing like I said don't base too many
decisions off of it because ultimately
you're not gonna be able to see the
difference it's useful though for
applications if you're using
professional stuff looking at other
games Metro is an outlier titanfall I
found very interesting titanfall only
reads 8 files when you're playing the
game so it loads it all that's it that's
all it wants for one level is 8 files it
writes to 352 it's writing almost 300
megabytes and it's reading to 156
kilobytes and those that's a lot of
writes so you might be wondering why
doesn't my Drive balloon when I'm
playing games and that's because these
are mostly cache and temporary files so
it's dumping it all as soon as it no
longer needs the data which may be at
the end of the level or it may be at the
end of the session if it's some kind of
anti cheat thing or logging stuff like
that some of it will be permanent like
kilobytes on your save file but that's
not that's about it watchdogs 725 read 5
5 5 right not too exciting there for the
rest of it and then now we can look at
the load time or the load file sizes and
the distribution there this is the file
size and count of files during loading a
game so this is different from plain
it's the initial startup and that's
useful for if you're trying to figure
out how long it will take you to load
that application
or game in this instance 32k is
extremely popular in loading and that's
probably just a package thing I'm not a
game developer right if you're a game
developer I would love it if you can
email us hit the contact form and and we
can talk about how you guys build
packages for games for easier
distribution and optimization but 32k is
very popular here 16k very popular 4k
very popular then after that it's eight
and everything else so 4k is still a
front-runner but you can see 32k is
pretty big here and that's probably
things like maybe your movies or your
promotional videos for Nvidia or Intel
or AMD that type of thing at the
beginning of it those would be bigger
files in terms of the rights 4k is very
popular it's actually more than 60% for
three out of our five and more than 50%
for four out of our five so 4k writes
very important for loading a game some
reason why that is I would have to guess
it's probably log files in case your
game crashes astray in loading or it's
probably maybe Steam is doing something
if it's a steam operated game things
like that Windows is probably writing
things too because those will be in here
as background noise because it's
probably logging your events as an
happen so 4k is very popular than 16
after that so what do we learn from this
data well you the cool stuff in my
opinion is just how many files games are
loading it is mind-blowing to think that
while you're playing Metro it is
transacting 11 thousand files reads and
writes that is a lot of files that's a
lot of textures a lot of objects in the
game a lot of models and then of course
you've got all your if there's any
events it has to grab that event data
from the drive so there's a lot of cool
stuff going on animations as well
rigging and and that's just cool to me
it doesn't necessarily make your drive
faster to know that but it's cool and
that's part of the fun of doing hardware
and gaming work and you can't apply this
knowledge not necessarily the game is
because here's why you're like I said if
you buy a $300 SSD versus a 1
dollar SSD it is gonna run cska or
watchdogs effectively identically it's
gonna be the same loading time it's
gonna play just as seamlessly or not
seamlessly and those seamlessness
actions will be a result of the game's
optimization more than your drive on an
SSD now in a game like Skyrim
you might notice a little stutter if
you're playing on a go play Skyrim on a
hard drive and especially if you load it
with like 4k texture packs and mods if
you Zone in Skyrim you zone by cells
there's no loading screen except in some
areas but work with me here so if you
load a new cell you're dumping data for
the old one that you're not gonna be in
anymore and you're loading fetching data
for the new one and this can create a
stutter because of your storage
bottleneck all pcs are bottlenecks on
storage at this point with an SSD that's
gonna vanish for the most part and it
doesn't matter what SSD you use so this
data isn't gonna make your drive faster
but when you're selecting the drive what
it can do is help you understand from an
application level if you're doing things
with Photoshop or with premiere or with
encryption this is very useful
information and you'll see I'm I'm going
to benchmark all of those things just
like it did games and you'll be able to
research your drives and see ok this is
gonna be the fastest at encrypting huge
amounts of data this is gonna be the
fastest at encoding h.264 files from
Adobe Premiere and that's and that's
important stuff to know this stuff is
just cool but there's nothing wrong with
that
so if you're really curious about how
SSDs work please subscribe to the
channel check out the links in the
description below check out the newest
article I just wrote it kind of gets you
started on this stuff and as always let
me know in the comments if you have a
question I will more likely see comments
on the website than YouTube these days
but do let me know II think if you have
