episode of ask GN now that we are back
from copy text we had a lot of questions
to dig through through the discord chat
for patreon backers if you're not one of
those you can go to patreon.com/scishow
to join the discord chat a lot of fun
with everyone on there and they've
submitted some great questions but we
also have some from YouTube from the
previous sgn video before that this
content is brought to you by custom
backplate makers at v1 techcom the UN
tech builds GP back ways to order with
their online customization tool making
it easy to theme upcoming PC builds back
plates cost $25 and up and are installed
via magnets and can be seen in some
shots of the cards reviewing that lately
used code gamers Nexus 5 for five
dollars off your order or click the link
below before getting started as always
you can leave your questions below if
you have them for next episode and right
now the one I want to start off with is
pretty timely and topical this is from
I'm a Jedi bra huh this cord who asked
am I allowed to ask a question about
this image and he sent me an image that
we can probably put on the screen and
said given the 28th lane at CPU and 24
lanes on the chipset it seems to give
you more lanes than x99s at 40 Lane CPU
I'm curious to see if the grief Intel
got was premature now regarding the the
grief part of this this is in reference
to a lot of the talk online the past
week or so about PCIe Lane count on
Intel's upcoming sky like ax and KB like
xcp is mostly sky like axe really and
how those CPUs the $600 one especially
have a lower link count than you might
have expected so the question being well
if you add the lane count on those CPUs
to the lane count available through the
chipset why is there an outcry because
that's still a lot of lanes so first
thing to go through here is a primer on
PCH vs. CPU lanes this is actually this
is a question I've answered a lot and
asked gns indirectly over the past
probably six months or so but it's worth
doing again in a more dedicated format
PCH and CPU lanes are not the same at
least on Intel platforms or
and tell platforms the way Intel does it
is that they have a certain amount of
lanes on the CPU maybe it's 16 for some
of them those lanes are pretty much
reserved for graphics so those will go
from the cpu straight to the PCIe device
whatever that may be normally a video
card in the first slot maybe you have
two video cards and you can run 2 by 8
configurations or if you're running AMD
and you can crossfire then you could run
three but you'd be stepping down to it
by four in one of the slots and you
probably want some kind of pecks or plx
chip on there but the way their chipset
works is the PCH has a certain amount of
HS i/o lanes or high-speed i/o lanes
high-speed i/o lanes on the chipset are
somewhat assignable by the motherboard
manufacturer so let's say you have 30 HS
i/o lanes as with the current G series
chipsets if you have 30 HS i/o lanes
some of those will be reserved but most
of them you can assign out as the
manufacturer not as the user and send to
devices like Gigabit Ethernet maybe you
use some 4 10 gigabit ethernet if you
have the capability on a workstation
board you might send them to other PCIe
devices like MDOT - SSDs that might be
on an nvme protocol or something like
that but you can send out these lanes to
different devices on the board you too
would be another example and those
devices high-speed i/o are normally
going to use something like 5 4 so
because of this the PCH can only assign
its lanes and chunks of four so by that
I mean if you wanted to pull lanes off
the PCH and use them for a device in a
full length 16 PCIe slot what you would
actually be doing is pulling four lanes
off the PCH or peeling off the lanes we
say and applying those to the slot so
the slot might be wired for 16 but it
will only receive four from the PCH now
realistically what will happen is as
long as the CPU has lanes available it
will assign all those lanes down to the
PCIe slots for all your graphics devices
pretty intelligent about that but if you
exhaust those lanes and run
to them and you have to pull something
off PCH it's an a by for config that's
not compatible with SLI SLI demand by
eight at a minimum it could work with
crossfire but your quality of lane goes
down off the PCH the the arguments I
think or the the concern or whatever it
may be from all the the discussion
online is that generally speaking you
want as many lanes as possible out of
your total lane count to come off of CPU
it's a bit higher value because those
lanes are going to be assignable to
graphics devices and they're on the CPU
whenever you're eliminating steps from
the process and having to go physically
else around the board it's always a good
thing it's a bit faster so I think
that's that's what a lot of it is
because the value of the lay on the CPU
is higher and for multigp you kind of
need it but also I think what happens or
what has happened with some of the grief
as you put it that Intel got was
probably to do with with perception of
how these lanes are created where it
looks like I'm just kind of interpreting
what I've seen online here not making a
comment but I think what people see is
it looks to them like Intel basically
throws a switch and turns off or on a
certain amount of lanes for a product to
potentially artificially create a
product in a different price category
that would otherwise be identical to a
higher tier product with more lanes that
cost more and there may be some truth to
that I'm not 100% sure how Intel manages
their lanes I don't know the validation
steps that go into having more lanes
maybe there is actually some cost
involved there there probably is but is
it the cost that we're seeing in these
new products I can't answer that however
I think that's where a lot of the
discussion online has come from is that
that understanding of the situation and
the fact that the CPU lanes are higher
value than the PCH lanes for things
outside of HSI oh like graphics cards so
hopefully that that primer on how PCH
and CPU lanes are assigned and used
helps out with understanding
why you would want more CPU lanes even
though the total CPU plus PC a Chilean
count is higher but if there's more
questions on this leave them below that
is by all means not the most
comprehensive discussion you could give
on this topic but given that this is an
osteon we've got other things to go
through I think that's not bad to get
you started next question is from Jesse
Shelton who posted on YouTube and said
I'm choosing a 1080i for water-cooling
do the better VRMs on aiv partner cards
actually make a difference for
overclocking or are they just for show
some say the founders Edition has ample
power capacities others say it does
doesn't so as specifically speaking to
the founders edition 1080i we have a PCB
analysis which includes a vrm analysis
done by build Zoid on our Channel and as
build voices in that video the 1080i
founders Edition card actually has a
pretty good vrm it is one of the better
products that intel has deserved Intel's
talking out into all the time NVIDIA has
designed in the past year or so with
regard to reference boards actually
longer than that probably if you look
back farther but it's a good board the
founders Edition card is actually not
bad the problem is the cooler the cooler
is kind of bad but if you're going to
buy it and water cool it then the board
itself is pretty good already that said
it does have lower power capability it
will it will physically push less power
through the circuits than some of the
higher-end cards like you might get with
a Strix or if you go really extreme like
a kingpin or a lightning card but it
depends on what you're doing how useful
those extra phases and those
higher-quality VRMs might be so with
something like a Strix you get you're
buying more than just the different vrm
the custom PCB you're buying a better
cooler than the founders Edition has
some of that value is lost when your
water cool in any way and with a kingpin
or a lightning card there is definitely
value to be had in those boards because
if you're doing XOC stuff lnto or
otherwise you eliminate a lot of the
footwork where you would have to do hard
mods to the card in order to get it to
carry the same capacity as
a as an out-of-box kingpin card
something like that
is eliminating a lot of the work on the
FB cards but for just normal water
cooling and for maybe some very basic
overclocking by which I mean you go
through EVGA precision or MSI
Afterburner or one of those tools and
you set some kind of offset to the core
and call it a day
founders Edition is really not bad it is
fine for that application and is
basically exactly what it's meant for
with regard to what are cooling there
are better options but to answer your
question I don't think that you will
really get a significant gain in your
clock out of those alternatives that
said if you're running at stock the
aftermarket boards generally do have a
higher stock clock rate than the FE card
almost always and in those cases you
would see the difference in fps it can
be anywhere from six percent well it's
probably about a six percent but if
you're moving from EFI air to
liquid-cooled other card or air-cooled
other card like Astrix it's six to
eleven percent so hopefully that helps
with that one basically epi is fine if
you're doing something that some fairly
basic overclock with it and what are
cool next questions from ryerson on
discord Ryerson says in the deleting
video there Bauer mentioned re pasting
this is something I hadn't really given
much thought to I know stock control
placed on om computers is usually pretty
poor especially after five or more years
I've never really noticed any thermal
issues with my own build although I
don't really check once it's set up and
configured is this something that an
enthusiast would want to check on a
long-term or regular basis or perhaps
preventative maintenance item
nobody really covers long-term effects
with respect to thermal pace and I
suspect that's why because there's not
much hard data out there on the subject
let's not wait true anytime you're
looking at something that takes years to
accumulate it's hard to really do
research on it so yeah they're bauer
mentioned repay Steen he was I can't
recall off the top of my head if we were
talking about repay Seng after you've
deleted the CPU or repainting the
outside of IHS but either way let's just
assume that we're talking to a more
normal application where you
the CPU installed it's not been deleted
and you just have some thermal paste on
top of it and then your CPU cooler I
have seen the effects of thermal paste
aging to some extent with poorer
products laptops come to mind we did
some thermal paste changes on one of the
labs that I was working on recently I
think we even have a video of it and it
saw a pretty massive change in thermal
performance so that also involves
blowing out the fans but that paste on
the laptops a lot of them it kind of
turned into like a crystallized really
hard useless compound that all it does
is inter interrupt contact between the
two metal plates that want to make
contact or the dye in the metal plate so
yes definitely there are long-term
effects where their own compound can age
not all of it ages the dow corning stuff
that intel uses inside the IHS i
actually does really well with thermal
cycling which is how you measure the
life of a thermal paste by the weights
in thermal cycling so that does really
well the stuff i've seen is a lot of
laptops is garbage and should be redone
in every couple years especially because
laptops are not airtight and dust gets
in there
if dust can get into where you're thrown
paste is in your desktop or your laptop
it will rapidly age of the compound you
start getting little particles in there
that interrupt the contact between the
services and overall the aging is a lot
faster and the compound loses
performance so the best thing to do is
test your performance using something
that you're going to remember how to do
in a couple years and repeat that test
maybe yearly or something like that and
just see how it's doing as preventative
maintenance it should be pretty obvious
if your performance really gets bad
because you're going to start dropping
clocks or hearing the fans go crazy to
try and keep up with with the CPU
temperature so the fan speed starts
ramping a lot over time and it's louder
than it used to be it might be if their
own compound contact issue or a pump
fail or something's or a liquid
permeation in the loop or something like
that about it yes it's actually real
thing you should repay every now and
then but it does tend to be
a couple of years it's not like
something you're gonna have to do more
than once a year or even once a year
that we're talking a couple years for
most pastes the next question is from no
twist on discord he said quick question
if there is a temperature line for CLC's
which is allowed by it well I suppose to
rephrase this is there a temperature
limit for CLC's which is ill advised to
surpass is a hybrid GPU that is 70
degrees under load okay
or will the liquid at that temperature
give me headaches down the road going
back to the focus on silent computing
what's the max recommended temperature
you would run a CLC at the max
recommended temperature well the maximum
temperature by spec for a subject
coolers which is what you would find on
a traditional hybrid bod is 60 Celsius
for the liquid not for the silicon but
for the liquid liquid temp is a whole
lot lower than the silicon temperature
but the 60 Celsius number is what ASX
specifies for when there starts to be
problems so those problems would include
things like permeation almost
exclusively where at 60 Celsius liquid
temperature you start experiencing
permeation into the rubber tubes at
which point you've got less liquid in
the loop so the pump has to work harder
you're going to hear wine a lot more and
your temperature will be worse over time
because you're losing liquid out of the
loop so 60 C is the number that you're
looking for for a Sutekh products and
other products like cool it or Kuwaiti
although I don't have their number are
not going to be dissimilar from that as
for the max temperature for a hybrid GPU
we've had pretty good luck running those
EVGA hybrid kits specifically including
their stock fan at 40% fan speeds and
still staying below most air-cooled
cards like less than 65 C for sure but I
from top off top of my head I think most
time we're in the 50 to 60 Celsius range
out of 40 percent fan speed with the
pomp at max so you should probably stop
that down 10 percent also so you'll be
fine there and it'll be really quiet
quieter than everything else in the
system on is you've got a fully passive
like very quiet or passive power supply
and very quiet or passive CPU coolers up
forty percent fans beat is perfectly
safe liquid temperature is well within
control it's under 35 C and all of our
testing but if your ambience really high
it would still be under 40 C so that
should hopefully get you started there
the spec though 60 C is the number last
question try watt toss it shun says I
believe this is from YouTube says with
new processors going to more than 140
watt TDP well air coolers continue to
suffice while remaining same proportions
dissipation is roughly thin area which
is pretty much the occupied volume of
the thin stack so we take a Noctua and
15 or c1 and scale by 140 over 90 5 or
190 over 95 in the case of thread Ripper
that arrives at quote huge
hanging off your motherboard surely
which is one of the most accurate
specifications you could give for that
system yes no hate on a iOS but my only
worry about them as reliabilities
because especially if one has a few
systems to maintain do you think we'll
be seeing a whole new generation of
larger or more efficient air coolers or
will those processors be limited liquid
only there will definitely air coolers
will still be fine they can handle 140
watts if they're designed properly and
have a good fan and have enough surface
area and things like that thread Ripper
is different story I'm not really sure
what thread Ripper will be equipped with
I'm thinking that it'll ship with a
stock liquid cooler kind of like what we
saw with the FX 9000 series that's my
guess so I'm thinking stock liquid for
those I'm not really sure what the air
cooler market looks like once you start
getting into the higher TDP is past 150
which is what thread Ripper may end up
in with at least with overclocks and
things like that
so I'm not 100% sure of the answer to
that part of the question for 140 watts
there will still be coolers they it
should be possible to buy some that
aren't huge I mean like the be quiet
dark what is it the dark rock 3 pro dark
rock pro 3 that cooler is gigantic
as one of the worst mounting mechanisms
I've worked with but it's huge like
you're saying and I'm not convinced that
it's within the Intel spec for some of
the sockets that are like LGA 1150 exits
so it would be fine for 2011 sockets so
there's there's definitely a point where
you can start entering into CPU coolers
that should not be used on things with
the smaller sockets like 11 5 X but keep
in mind that the 2000 series sockets
from Intel 20 66 now and the tr4 socket
will have a stronger mechanism so that
you shouldn't be as at risk of warping
the board which is really what you're
worried about when you have those higher
weights and densities in a small area
with the tr4 socket I don't have this
back for it but if you look at the thing
in its current state it takes three Torx
screws I think make my b allen keys but
three Torx screws to undo giant piece of
metal with a huge really thick backplate
like 1 2 1 2 3 millimeters thick on that
on that backplate so it should be able
to support a pretty large cooler but I
do think those will be liquid for Intel
the answer is yes you will still be able
to get air coolers the thing you start
running into is they might become a
little less efficient if you were to run
them out of fixed noise like if you
normalized for noise between air and
liquid you start running into problems
with some of the air coolers on the
market if you're trying to stick at
something like 40 DBA but I agree with
you that air coolers tend to be a little
bit more preferred for an application
where you really you don't want to have
that one extra potential point of
failure in a liquid solution like a pump
or whatever it may be or just aging
because those CL CS only really live
usefully for about five years before you
should replace them anyway so I agree
with you there but I don't have a great
answer for you I think we saw some of
the coolers coming out of Computex are
trying to solve for this problem some of
them are going to be crazy with copper
that seems to be one of the things this
year which won't really help steady
state temperature is a ton if you're
looking at two identical coolers other
than top
in aluminum but it will help with
controlling the fan curve and with ramp
up and ramp down times so that we'll be
testing all that stuff I have a lot of
thermal testing plans for both Red River
and skylake X not sure about KB like
eggs but we'll be testing those so stay
tuned for all that because we should
have that information out pretty shortly
after launch well the products so you
can make your decisions before building
the system that's all for this one as
always you can leave questions below for
next time patreon.com/scishow stuff is
that directly or to join the discord
chat where some of these questions come
through it's just it's really easy to
interact there and by and out there most
today so easy to get some questions
thanks for watching as always subscribe
