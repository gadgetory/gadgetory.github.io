dotnet and this is our Assassin's Creed
syndicate benchmark which looks at the
game across various graphics settings
including one of our own custom
configurations that we used for most
testing and that was created
specifically to ensure fairness between
Nvidia and AMD GPUs and I'll explain why
that methodology is important going
forward so Assassin's Creed syndicate is
a particularly interesting game the
benchmark even if you're not going to
play it and that's because if we look at
previous AC titles unity in particular
the game is one of the few games out
there that will actually make use of the
additional vram provided by some lower
and mid tier cards including as an easy
example the gtx 960 where you have two
gigabyte and four gigabyte models
available in the case of unity we saw
that there is actually a measurable
impact between two and four gigabytes on
the same gtx 960 outside of some changes
because there were different brands and
you can watch the whole video on that if
you're interested but it made for a cool
benchmarking title that's why we're back
along with other reasons like to see how
the game works and how it performs so
Assassin's Creed syndicate some
important things to know this is a very
GPU intensive title and it's very
geometrically complex there's a lot of
Polly's but it's not overly it's not
overdoing it with poly count as some
games do there's definitely a lot of
them but the game does try to push
fidelity through shadows and lighting as
a very sort of less heavy-handed way to
show the fidelity of the game the higher
graphics quality without necessarily
just flooding you with polygons so that
is something that AC is known for really
leveraging their shadows and lighting
which makes sense because none of the
day they are trying to appear at least
how much like a stealthy game so this
game also is a game works title which
means that it does include some of
Nvidia's proprietary technology and
these are things that we generally
disabled for testing between AMD and
nvidia to ensure a level test platform
but to recap what's in there because you
will be hearing a lot about it this week
and today especially the main items are
shadow works which include
p CSS or percentage closer soft shadows
and that has a pretty big impact on
performance on nvidia and AMD and then
there's temporal anti-aliasing is in
there which is not a shadow works tech
but it is an anti-aliasing technology
and TX AAA basically says I'm going to
do anti-aliasing I'm going to take two
or four taps per pixel or two or four X
as you may know it and take those over
multiple frames so you're analyzing it
over multiple frames makes a little bit
less immediately intensive and allows
for the removal of some things like the
marching pixels or marching ants effect
that you get with shimmering and thin
objects like grass where it's tall and
thin and txa a will help remove that but
it is ultimately an nvidia accelerated
technology so we disable it for most of
our testing the other tech in here other
than pcs s is Nvidia's HBA oh and HBA o+
which is another form of ambient
occlusion the HB version of ambient
occlusion is a little more aggressive it
creates a slightly more realistic look
based on the lights position so if I
have the Sun behind me and you pretend
that wall as a window the sun shining
through it HBA Oh we'll have a pretty
big impact on how that shows that the
shadows and the shading between
connected surfaces within the game but
again and video accelerated so we
disable it for most tests the
alternative is SSAO and that's what we
use so to go over the settings for our
benchmark whenever you see though or
hear the word custom settings or ultra
custom as we've called it that means one
thing it means we've gone to ultra high
within Assassin's Creed syndicate and
we've changed the anti-aliasing down to
only FXAA for a couple of reasons which
I'll explain we've changed shadows from
pcs s2 only high within the game and
then we've changed ambient occlusion to
SSAO and that's to create a perfectly
level bench between AMD and be
in our testing we saw about a twenty
percent performance hit from PCs s being
enabled so just pc SS vs high for
shadows and we saw close to a thirty-six
percent hit with pcs s ultra which is a
little bit more aggressive against the
high shadow setting again so pretty big
performance disparity there and you
really shouldn't be using it unless
you've got some high-powered GPU set up
with anti-aliasing we saw another big
hit with MSA a 2x plus FXAA versus just
FXAA the impact was about twenty four
point seven percent somewhere in that
range about twenty five percent on
average and for that reason we opted for
only FXAA for almost all of our testing
some tests including the 1080p
ultra-high tests were conducted with the
anti-aliasing msaa option enabled so you
do have it there if you actually want to
play with MSAA and the big thing here is
just the performance it's so massive
that we didn't want to present the game
as unplayable because you're taking a
25-percent hit from anti-aliasing which
quite a few people can live without but
we tested both for those who wanted
let's get into the benchmarks here if it
hasn't already been shown in this video
at this point the 30-second bench mark
course is available on our YouTube
channel it was rendered at 4k but we
downsampled it to 1080p 60 for YouTube
purposes and that's available if you
want to see how we tested it and try and
replicate our results starting at 4k
Assassin's Creed syndicate is
effectively unplayable at our tested
settings that doesn't mean it's
unplayable period at 4k but at our
settings it is at a time of testing we
were unable to get an SLI configuration
functioning within Assassin's Creed
syndicate I did use the brand-new 359
drivers that at time of testing were not
available and these are optimized for AC
syndicates so we contacted n video we're
talking to them and we're trying to
figure out hey is this normal or if
there's something screwy going on on our
driver setup I'll update on the website
as soon as what you hear back but for
now SLI did not work and we were unable
to find a
single GPU configuration that would
adequately play Assassin's Creed
syndicate at our custom settings
arrangement using lower graphics output
closer to medium for example or low or
medium maybe a little bit of high the
980 TI would be a contender but that
sort of eliminates the point of high
resolution gaming because now you're
losing a lot of your fidelity and the
GPU just can't keep up with the load
generated by AC syndicate at 4k with
ultra and custom settings and it does
struggle even at things like high or
very high so the 60 FPS metric is kind
of just out of reach of our highest tier
cards that we have in-house here as
always I don't currently have the fury X
it was on loan when we first tested it
so I don't have one now I'm sorry but
we're trying to get one the 980 I though
is a pretty good representation of where
things fall moving down to 1440p shows
things in a more playable light the 980
TI runs at about sixty six FPS average
with fairly strong one percent and point
one percent lows and is what we would
deem a playable card for these higher
settings the GTX 980 non ti holds on at
about 57 FPS average but could do with a
slight settings tweak down toward hi for
example for maximize playability still
57 FPS for Assassin's Creed is fairly
acceptable and since we're not dealing
with competitive level framerate demands
as in some FPS games this is something
that is really reasonable and I would
settle on though you will see bigger
hits during major combat scenes and
things like that that may dictate
dropping to a high ultra hybrid set up
at 1440p the brand new r9 380 x pushes
just under 40 FPS following shy of
playability of 1440 but it is a two
hundred thirty dollar card so you can't
knock it too hard here and this is with
our custom settings so again dropping
closer to medium will cut close but then
you're losing out on a lot of the
fidelity so it's really more of a 1080
performer looking at these charts for
something closer to playable we look
toward the gtx 980 the 980 I and those
are cards priced at 500 and 600
50 respectively the r9 390 x-files below
pit the FPS cutting it a bit close there
and it would play except ibly at a
hybrid of medium and high settings but
again you're really cutting it close
depending on how close you need to be to
60 FPS to be satisfied as a gamer that's
really up to you to decide moving to
1080p with our ultra custom settings the
most flooded setting in terms of GPU
population by the way there's a lot of
cards on here everything from the gtx
960 for gigabyte to the r9 380 x and up
the new 380 x can play the game
reasonably well sans a few occasional
drops and frame rate during heavy load
periods but generally they play pretty
well the r9 380 which unfortunately we
no longer have as it was on loan and had
to be sent back would land a couple
percent below the 380 x based on history
of the other seven or so games we tested
the two on and you'll see that in our
380 x review separately this would
realistically plant the 380 closer to 50
FPS though we can't validate that
obviously as i don't have one but based
on knowledge and experience that's about
where would land as for cards that we do
have the 3 90 x pushes over 60 FPS
alongside the gtx 970 up 72 FPS and the
980 and 980 TI are bordering on overkill
with these settings so really not
necessary to buy one of those but at
1080p with ultra-high not our custom
settings the story is a bit different
ultra high changes one thing it changes
the anti-aliasing from FXAA 24 tab MSAA
and that hammers the settings that
performance delta to the tune of about
twenty percent and these suffers the
most here as andy does tend to struggle
with things like tessellation and
anti-aliasing processing in particular
but if you really want anti-aliasing if
you need it at 1080 then this is why we
tested it this is what you need to look
at generally you're in the 980 territory
for playing with anti-aliasing enabled
the most interesting data in the 1080p
benchmarks is the gtx 960 performance
where we see the 16 point three percent
performance disparities shown favoring
the 4 gigabyte card versus the two
gigabyte card this is pretty exciting to
see as only a few games truly make use
of the additional two gigabytes of vram
on cards like the 960 or the 380 where
you have multiple skus available and
this 960 it can sometimes choke on its
own core clock which does limit the
extent to which the extra vram can be
utilized in some games but syndicate
shows that there is a clear benefit
again about sixteen percent 16 percent
for the four gigabyte card bridge the
two gigabyte card and shows that there
is a place in the market for both of
them to exist so then the best cards for
Assassin's Creed syndicate depend the
resolution you want and assuming no
anti-aliasing you're looking at the GTX
970 and the r9 390 X at 1080p with our
custom settings the 390 x trails by
about seven FPS and our benchmarks but
it's still above 60 and it's a bit more
affordable it's closer to three hundred
dollars sometimes 320 the 970 depending
on where you're looking is going to be
on average 32 maybe sixty dollars more
expensive than the 390 X but those are
the two main options to look at for
1080p gaming with near max settings
basically if you're willing to drop down
to medium still 1080p just medium then
the cards to look at would be am these
brand new r9 380 x which is two hundred
thirty dollars that can play just fine
and the existing gtx 960 from nvidia we
would recommend the four gigabyte model
in this case because again pretty big
difference between the two but that's
where i'd be looking for the medium ish
settings range you can get some probably
too high but generally you're on a mix
of medium settings and that's putting
you in the 200 to 250 dollar range for
GPU if you need 1440p gaming the place
to look is going to be something like a
980 TI or a fury x which we don't have
because it was on my head we had this
headed back but one of those cards would
put you in the range of 1440p gaming
pretty reasonably and if you need to get
to 4k it's really going to be a
multi-gpu configuration that's the only
way to do it and again at time of our
testing sli was not presently functional
so we couldn't validate that at least
not for us it may work I've asked 10
video what's going on we'll see what
they say but for our tests SI was not
working and as soon as
we'll test and see where those two 980
TI is fall and if they can produce a
playable frame rate for 4k at the ultra
settings so that is all for this video
