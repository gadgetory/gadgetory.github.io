a lot of criticism for Andes packs with
the new Vega video cards primarily
because it's known to have severe
flickering issues and we've managed to
reproduce them but the conditions for
reproducing those issues really very
heavily based on the card and what
you're doing so it's not quite as simple
as this thing flickers and today we are
looking at the C 34 F 7 9 1 WQ Thank You
Samsung for that easy to remember name
so 791 is what we're looking at and
we're testing it on the rx 500 series
the Vega 56 and the Vega frontier
edition with different driver branches
to see how persistent the flickering
issue is before getting to that this
video is brought to you by synergy the
software that lets you share a keyboard
and mouse between multiple systems if
you have limited desk space and multiple
computers to command synergy removes the
need for separate peripherals or a KVM
and works as over the network software
use our link below to get 50% off the
basic or pro version most of the
flickering stems from what Samsung calls
their ultimate engine mode there are
three modes ultimate engine standard and
off for free sync where it's just
disabled even in Samsung's manual they
note that ultimate engine may cause
flickering with this display so it's a
known issue even to them ultimate engine
widens the bandwidth provided to the
ASIC on the panel driver which means
that your variable refresh goes from 80
to 100 Hertz up to 48 to 100 Hertz so it
expands the variable refresh rate range
under free thinks so that it will work
with lower frame rates there are plenty
of other issues with this monitor as
well we noticed a few weird patterns and
behaviors when changing colors on the
screens we have multiple different
objects of high contrasting colors like
a movie playback and then a black or a
white webpage on the other side which
sometimes cause color pattern changes
and things like that but that's not
really what we're talking about today
because those are on Samsung side of
things and it does impact the monitors
value to certain users but we're really
focusing on the precinct under the
argument so with the flickering we can
reproduce it here you're not going to
see as much on that camera because of
how the filming set up for
me being in front of 2,000 LEDs but we
have b-roll of it flickering that
flickering is produced on an rx 580 and
it can be produced with the oldest
drivers and with the newest drivers that
were ever available and are currently
available for the rx 580 no problem
whatsoever we can get it to flicker
severely to the point where if you were
going to buy this thing and you had a
580 I would tell you absolutely do not
do it it's unless you don't care about
precinct in which case why are you
buying it anyway but it's not a good
experience with freesync with a 580 with
the drivers we've tested but there's an
interesting caveat if we test Vega 56 we
actually see these issues pretty much
disappear and there are some differences
with Vega frontier edition but with 56
we tried total war which is known to be
just really terrible for flickering with
this display we produce those results on
the 580 you can see flickering in the
menus sometimes you can see flickering
in the campaign mode and in a lot of
other places there's weird shadow
flickering there are brightness changes
all kinds of weird behaviors with the
samsung Display and Polaris GPUs but
with regard to flickering specifically
couldn't reproduce it basically at all
on Vega 56 we couldn't reproduce it in
this demo which is an old Andy freesync
demo from CES and really reliably
produces the issue on the 500 series we
couldn't reproduce it in the total war
games in ashes of the singularity in
gta5 and in this testing we did testing
from about 30 fps
all the way up to above and while at 100
Hertz or above 100 Hertz if we felt like
expanding beyond what precinct would
allow just to test it and the result was
at all of those refresh rates and frame
rates we couldn't visibly to the human
eye produce the issue on 56 we could
pick up flickering it with the camera
but there are a whole lot of weird
behaviors there like the camera shutter
for example although at various
different shutters we still saw
flickering on the camera for Vega 56 but
not to our eyes and regard
a list of what the reason for that may
be ultimately it's irrelevant if I can't
see it if you can't see it three people
here looked at it we could not see an
issue with Vega 56 so if we can't see it
on a camera can who cares
there's clearly some weird reason there
and it's cause because the camera is not
a human eyeball so the issue seems to be
non-existent on Vega 56 presently with
the drivers we've tested which are the
latest public drivers and the oldest
press Branch of the drivers what happens
if we go to Vega front erudition Vega
frontier edition is known to be on as of
its launch and older brands for drivers
that stemmed from Polaris or at least
Fiji or something older like that so
throwing in a frontier edition card we
got some interesting results the card at
first looked like it wasn't stuttering
or flickering rather at all and if it's
not flickering at all then that kind of
starts looking like it's some Vegas
Pacific update but as we watched it a
little bit longer we would occasionally
see flickers pop up it wouldn't be
sustained like we got on the 500 series
but they would certainly appear and it
was present in this demo its present in
total war which we filmed and a couple
of other places so with that being the
case this is now a question of is the
flickering occurring because of some
Polaris chip level defect where freesync
is just not working that well with
Polaris in which case alright we free
sync on this display particularly with
ultimate engine since it expands the
freezing range if that's the case that
really kind of sucks for Polaris owners
if it's not the case then it may be the
situation that AMD can issue a driver
update much like they did with Vega and
resolve the flickering at which point
where is the driver because it exists
for Vega maybe it's just a time pin
maybe the older cards are lower priority
than Vega that seems probable at this
point so we're not sure it seems like it
this issue
really
I feel like has to be a chimp level
issue or a driver level issue there's
really no where else to look especially
given the cards we've tested and with
our test conditions and what we've
experienced in testing it's hard to
declare if it's chip level or driver
level because with vega frontier edition
we still kind of see the problem and
that pushes us towards assuming a driver
level change since flickering exists on
vega frontier edition and not on 56 and
they're the same architecture that said
vega frontier edition is a really
special kind of card that has all kinds
of features disabled is broken in a lot
of ways and probably shouldn't have
shift at least in the state it did so
it's hard to say if one of those
hardware level differences in frontier
versus rx is causing those or its
drivers but all I'm telling you is the
problem exists on the 500 series we've
seen it which means it exists on the 400
series and probably well we know it
exists on the fury ax as well matter of
fact so all those complaints you've seen
about flickering on the samsung display
they're accurate it's not just because
they're pointing a camera at the screen
and unfortunately pointing a camera at
the screen as stated isn't such an easy
way to show the differences but
depending on what you're looking at in
our footage you you see two different
kinds of flickering one of them that
you'll see in the b-roll or have seen at
this point in the b-roll is when the
screen appears to flicker and we have
scopes on this that show the response of
how it flickers but it's only seen by
the camera and that's on Vega 56 and the
pattern of the flickering is more like a
wave and again the human eye cannot see
it we can't see it the other type of
flickering is an entire screen flicker
and this is the one that you need to
actually be concerned about because
that's what we see and it's clearly not
an issue of human eye shutter speed or
something like that that's the entire
screen kind of going whiter or lighter
color and then darker or dimmer and it's
just flickering like crazy that's on a
500 series the scopes show that as well
but it's a different pattern so that's
what you make that distinction when
you're looking at the footage of the 56
just know that we basically have to
switch between things like phone cameras
and our high-end camera because they
don't detect things the way human eyes
do but yes blue Korean is clearly an
issue on Polaris it'd be great if Andy
can take whatever they did for Vega and
apply it to the layers so that owners of
Polaris don't feel like they're left out
in the cold and forgotten over Vega if
Andy doesn't have that ability it's
probably a hardware level difference in
which case the very least we can tell
you that as much as we disagree with the
packs in general and the fact that
they're probably just in place to make
sure Andy doesn't lose money on Vega
especially 56 the fact of the matter is
if you're buying the pack with Vega
because that's the only thing that the
pack applies to not Polaris and you're
getting this monitor with Vega then the
issue really seems like it's nothing to
be concerned about your planet's users
from hilarious and take note but that's
I think that pretty much wraps us up
there's not a ton more we can do right
now to test we've contacted AMD and
asked hey do you guys know if anything
in Vega
has been updated to correct this issue
and they're looking into it there are a
lot of people at the company so not
everyone is going to know the answer to
that but we've asked and hopefully we'll
have an answer for you but otherwise
whatever you think about the packs
whatever you think about this monitor in
general flickering doesn't seem to be an
issue on Vega 56 with the card we've
tested we can't speak for all samples so
if some of you have the card as well if
any of you buy the monitor and use it
with 64 which is different card than 56
please let us know what your results are
you can easily test this and I'll tell
you how this display this demo is hard
to find now this windmill demo I'm going
to upload it somewhere and I'll put a
link to it in the description because
it's the easiest way to reproduce the
issue you can also use a total war if
you have that go to the campaign map the
next thing you need to do if you're
using this demo is disable vsync make
sure free sync is enabled go into the
monitor OSD enable ultimate engine and
set it to FPF sweep for the best results
and observe the flickering if it exists
you will see it at that point if it
exists because it'll go 55 to 60 FPS and
produce the issue if you using game to
test it ideally we found that the best
framerate range to reproduce the issue
on Valerius is to sit between about 48
fps which is the low end of the Refresh
range and maybe 60 65 you'll see the
worst flickering in those instances if
you're at a hundred or above it's just
not going to show up in our experience
so that's what you need to do to test it
yourself and then you can toggle free
sync on and off and if it goes away when
it's off but it's there when it's on
that means you're seeing the flickering
issue and if you see that on Vega please
let us know so that we can look into
this further but as of our testing we
don't see the problem on Vega so that
wraps us up as always you can go to
