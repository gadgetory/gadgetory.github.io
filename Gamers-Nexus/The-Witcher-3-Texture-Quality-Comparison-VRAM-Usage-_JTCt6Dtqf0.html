Nexus dotnet and today we're doing a
Witcher 3 texture quality comparison
this is similar to our GTA 5 texture
quality comparison that we did
previously
but obviously using the Witcher 3 so
what I did was I took texture
screenshots at ultra high medium and low
settings for the texture quality and I
showcased
the visual differences in screenshots
we'll be showing here and then we also
did a video RAM consumption chart that
basically measured how much the RAM was
used relative to the low texture quality
setting and finally did an FPS benchmark
to look at the actual performance impact
of different settings to see whether
it's worth turning them down in order to
eke out some extra frames per second the
entire methodology of showcasing the
various texture qualities within our
screenshots is described in the article
link to the description below I won't go
through all that here but the short of
it is all really describes best just by
looking at these screenshots so this is
where you see the difference between
medium and low or really low in any
setting is massive the difference
between high and ultra visually is
pretty small it's very difficult to
notice you have to nitpick pretty hard
and that's not something you'll see
in-game for the most part but that
doesn't mean you should be playing on
high because it doesn't necessarily
impact performance as we'll find out
momentarily in terms of the video memory
consumption the chart here shows our low
setting as the baseline and we represent
this as 0 megabytes meaning we're
measuring Delta over low in this
instance because we don't know the
precise value that low texture quality
consumes in terms of video RAM because
we've got all these other settings that
impact consumption of video memory so we
use that as 0 and then we do the deltas
medium increases video RAM consumption
by 68 megabytes
high by 268 megabytes and ultra by 273
megabytes so pretty big differences
there with high and medium but not
really anywhere else so you can see here
that the medium texture quality
increases video memory consumption by 68
megabytes
while high pushes it to
to 68 so that's about a 200 megabyte
increase with ultra at 273 a four to six
megabyte increase on average in our test
we ran these tests multiple times to
eliminate outliers things like that so
these are the average results even at
our maxed out settings with hair works
disabled anti-aliasing disabled and SSAO
on those were the only changes other
than all Macs the game was consuming
around 1,800 megabytes of video memory
after accounting for other system
consumption of VRAM like logging
utilities things like that so it does
look fairly good as a game but it's not
eating massive chunks of memory like GTA
5 farcry things like that the frame rate
performance is basically identical
across the board it's within one to two
FPS and I had to conduct each of these
tests like 10 times to get parity
because the differences are so small
that every single FPS in one direction
or another will reflect on the results
so we have to conduct the test more
frequently to make sure it is all in
line with what should be shown so that's
the texture quality comparison for The
Witcher 3 be sure to subscribe to the
channel if you like this content we do
all kinds of guides like this intention
with these is to provide interesting or
useful information that even if you're
not playing the game we're talking about
The Witcher 3 in this instance hopefully
you can still get something out of it
because technology is cool and
technology as it pertains to gaming is
really cool so that's sort of what we're
trying to do here subscribe if you like
it check out our new patreon page that's
an effort we're doing to try and
increase the quality and frequency of
content and I will see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
