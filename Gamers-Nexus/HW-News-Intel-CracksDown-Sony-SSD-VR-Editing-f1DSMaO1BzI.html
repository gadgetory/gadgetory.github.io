temporary unlocked overclocking of the
multiplier for i3 and i5 cpus which were
not case Q Intel CPUs and as you all
know only the 6600 k and 6700 k of the
sky lake CPUs are meant for overclocking
and this bios update allowed you to go
in there and increase the multiplier
beyond stock so you get multiplier times
base clock or bcl k equals the operating
frequency asrock explicitly removed its
sky OC feature from bios in a recent
patch and it looks as if it may be
thanks to pressure from intel as rock
isn't the only motherboard makers
supporting non k overclocking though
asus gigabyte and msi also offers guy
like overclocking but it appears that
these big three manufacturers still have
the feature available so if they're
receiving pressure they haven't
responded to adjust yet get it while
it's hot i suppose with this
overclocking feature because the new
bios updates coming out have removed it
from asrock boards epic games made big
news this week with its VR editor for
Unreal Engine 4 which allows developers
to make their games with in Virtual
Reality while wearing the oculus or
other relevant headsets it all looks a
bit silly in the footage where we see
epic game CEO Tim Sweeney and technical
director Mike frikar flailing around to
demonstrate the VR building experience
but to be fair everyone look silly in VR
the difference between what epics
showing and what everyone else has done
so far is pretty critical as Epic Games
allows a full six degrees of freedom for
interface management using VR
controllers object placement object
transforms and rotation and full
immersion with the VR environment the
tool appears that most useful for
developers of VR games as it would allow
more accurate representations of the
user experience the Unreal VR editor
should be further demonstrated at
marches GDC 2016 which will be in
attendance for us to check the channel
for more on that Andy hasn't reasonably
updated its FX processors in a number of
years now but that hasn't stopped the
company from releasing refreshes along
the way including a new Wraith CPU
cooler for the AMD FX 83 and that was
released just this week we just reviewed
Andy's new wraith cooler showing that
it's cooling to noise ratio has improved
substantially over the old stock cooler
and the new
faith is available on the FX 8370 and
doesn't impact the units price which is
still a firm 210 dollars but 83 70s with
old coolers can be purchased now over
ten dollars less so that's a bit of a
difference but not much of one if you're
going with aftermarket coolers then you
could probably forgo the new wraith unit
if not then you must get the 83 70s at
new wraith cooler because it's just that
much quieter though the argument for the
8370 is pretty weak at this point and we
generally recommend intel or waiting
till Zen because these FX processors are
pretty aged architecture now as you'll
see in our full review japan-based Sony
broke news this week with entering the
SSD market place what is making consumer
SSDs starting with the SL w em series of
drives going up to 480 gigabytes in
total capacity the SSD is advertised to
be using the Phi's on s10 controller
which has grown in popularity as San
force has lost market presence with its
aged 2281 controllers the SL WM SSDs are
advertised by Sony as running at 560
megabytes per second sequential read and
530 megabytes per second sequential
write 4k speeds which are more
interesting the gamers are not yet known
and neither is pricing or other further
information this week was also covered
pretty heavily already on our channel
and website including the Corsair 400
see review am these wraith cooler which
we just mentioned and the iWeb power
revolt to PC and we have reviews of all
of that I'd strongly recommend checking
out the 400 see because that's fairly
big news even came out a little bit ago
we tested several cooling configurations
on the case which educates everyone as
to how these fans interact with tower
coolers on motherboards ACS this week
unveiled what is probably the most
hideous or near it anyway keyboard we've
ever seen it as a mechanical keyboard
called the Horus gk 2000 to be fair to
acs there is worse competition out there
but from a high-profile manufacturer
this is pretty bad it does though
arrival asus is at gaming routers that
have basically a fortress of solitude of
antennas built up around them although
it looks like plastic from the photos
and what you're looking at here the new
horse keyboard actually uses a cnc three
millimeter thick aluminum casing for the
top of the keyboard which is very
expensive
and the board also sports a massive
wrist rest that if you used it would
take up nearly the entirety of any
normal humans desk space it's running
Cherry MX red switches red LEDs with
individual key lighting and borrow some
ideas from Corsair with a brushed metal
faceplate unfortunately it's covered up
by the wind atrocity at the top and
massive wrist rest at the bottom so it's
not on a room for this type of thing we
don't yet know the price or the launch
date of the keyboard but there's still
hope that the latter answer is never
that's it for this week's hardware news
recap check the channel 4 news on gaming
including some mass effect battlefield
and titanfall news that we post just
yesterday and as always hit the patreon
link lapel video for Ana helps out
directly and subscribe to the channel
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
