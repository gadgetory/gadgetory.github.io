episode of ask GN this time I'm joined
by popular demand demand by our senior
Andy correspondent snowflake and also
sometimes CEO of gamers Nexus we have a
lot of good questions for this one as
noted recently we're shooting 2 episodes
per week now plus the bonus patreon
episode you know patreon.com slash
gamers and access to join us for that
and otherwise we'll be uploading both
the main ones to the main channel she's
left me already before that this video
is brought to you by the EVGA X 299 dark
motherboard the one that we recently
used to take a top 5 world record for
fire strike overclocking results the
EVGA x 299 dark board is one of the best
we've used presently in this current
generation and it has a coupon code of
gamers nexus for a savings of $75 off
for us customers expires on May 31st if
you've been interested in the X 299 dark
with its actual vrm heatsink and actual
vrm cooling capabilities that was a good
time to grab it use code gamers next as
that check out click the link in the
description below it's the first
question for this week for it well for
this episode of this week out of the
three we're shooting today is from
Looney juice who says besides a Nvidia's
quarterly report how is the DIY
enthusiast market doing all things
considered we got past the doom and
gloom articles and then into what I
guess was a bit of an enthusiast boom
we're still seeing new skiers of various
types of products but with so much
hammering the market is there even a way
to get a bead on how CPC components and
systems have been affected you talked
about multiple SKUs entering the market
isn't there like a new 1053 gigabyte
model like what is going on I understand
that Pascal is still doing well and
understand that there's not a new
generation so clearly there's some
demand I guess but really a 1053
gigabyte we really need that we've got
how many 10 60s and how a 210 30 is like
what is this product segmentation it's
super out of that I find it super
annoying that those types of SKUs are
entering the market but and to bring the
analyst back for this question
so overall things are for the enthusiast
market things are doing pretty well it's
actually one of the only growing
segments of the PC industry right now
pre-built not doing so well spree builds
are actually not gonna be able to answer
this from an AMD perspective now I don't
know why it's so difficult for her uh
the she's gonna fire me later the pre
bolts are the definitely the most
suffering part of the market there's
been shrinkage year-over-year and
anything from like Dell HP those types
of people and that's because think of
like your average non-gaming non
enthusiasts non workstation consumer
what do they need a desktop for you're
probably buying a laptop or something
like that or even a glorified phone in
some cases I guess I'd be a phone
glorified as a computer in some cases so
yeah I mean if you look at numbers from
most the analysts including John petit
research although I know they're not the
most highly regarded but overall the PC
segment is not doing great but the
enthusiast segments doing really well
and enthusiast hardware it's driving
sales that's why it's kind of
disheartening to see the memory price
issues and the GPU price issues because
it drives down adoption of enthusiast
pcs and makes everything look bad which
is why companies like Nvidia and AMD are
still so invested in PC gaming because
they know that's what's driving growth
in any kind of desktop sector so
definitely over all the enthusiasts is
doing just fine
like I answered a few ass gems ago I'm a
little concerned actually no it was that
the Paks panel I was on a panel at PAX
East with bit wit Kyle so in that panel
I answered a question about is are we in
dark times of PC space and I think yeah
I mean from a memory price perspective
from GPU prices it's definitely a bit of
a problem right now for adoption because
I don't know if memory costs half the
price of your computer to build then why
are you gonna build one so that's
certainly concerning but I think we'll
recover there with time the enthusiam
ensuing pretty well overall though is
just that one aspect is is a bit
troubling I
think we'll get through just fine though
oh and also quick sidenote again you're
right about the scuse hammer in the
market it's a bit ridiculous in some
aspects and clearly taking advantage of
the current situation which I don't
blame any company for that's kind of
what they do but now there's kind of a
limit to what's reasonable next one
ten fair and Zoo says wouldn't it be
smart to use high-performance top down
cooler as an octave and be quiet
that would also increase the airflow on
the board and would result in longer
component life I'm not mistaken it also
cool down the VR arms and help with OC
on cheaper boards really depends so in
an IT Xbox or something yeah
downdraft is good because it will get
air over the VRMs and even if that air
is warm it's still cooler than the VRMs
it's still airflow it still moves air
across the service and helps dissipate
our air is awful at thermal concerns a
thermal conductivity terrible interface
to use but obviously far better than
standing air which is what you get with
a CLC that's for example mounted to the
front so this is actually some data we
never published because we only got the
testing kind of half done it was right
before Christmas I think so you know it
gave people time off and stuff like that
it's never quite finished it but one
thing we learned is that vrm thermals if
you measure them properly with say a
tower cool or even like this piece of
garbage to my left except without the
liquid cooler attached to it tower
cooler like that even that will get some
airflow over the vrm is even if the fans
not directly pointed at them it's just
because there's air moving by nature of
getting sucked into the fan and that
performs well enough that compared to
like a front-mounted closed-loop liquid
cooler where you've got it mounted like
this this is the front of the case this
is the CPU this is the worst possible
configuration you could have if there's
no rear exhaust fan in the case because
in that situation you have all this
intake in the very front the CPU is
great it's gonna be really cool probably
the coolest it possibly can be within
reason and the VR abs however unless
there's a fan above or behind them will
get pretty hot and that's partly because
you're pushing warm air into the case
from the CPU so
case ambience higher from the
perspective the VRMs there's no airflow
over those vrm components and also the
cpu is cooler so you can push your
overclock potentially higher which means
that you're now pushing the vrm is
harder because if your CP is cooler you
don't really necessarily know that the
vrm is getting hot and obviously we can
all assume that but unless you have
measurements somewhere there's no good
way to know what temperature they
actually are short of putting a
thermocouple on it or using a board that
has a sensor and to be honest a lot of
people don't even know VR on
temperatures the thing you need to worry
about I certainly didn't for a number of
years when I was a new PC builder so I
don't blame anyone who doesn't and the
point is if you're just looking at CPU
temperature because that's the most
logical thing to be concerned with an
overclocking then yeah having a really
cool CPU means that you could end up
pushing the VR arms way harder because
you don't know that they're a problem so
downdraft coolers certainly eliminate a
lot of the VR I'm cooling concerns but
you're gonna be more limited on the CPU
cooling side so if it's not an ITX case
really the sort of best thing to do is
make sure your TP is cool to the extent
that you need it to be and then put a
fan somewhere in the back like either in
the rear and hopefully it pulls air
across the prm's or in the top isn't
really better problem with top is VT top
front it'll pull air out of the case
before it hits a tower cooler on the cpu
in which case you actually end up with a
warmer CPU because you're exhausting the
cool area from intake before it ever
gets there so you don't position a top
fan like exhaust too close to the front
of the case top intakes probably the
best you could possibly do it's just
that then you obviously have some dust
concerns so depending how you feel about
that dumps collecting on the top of the
case more likely to get inside the case
that that might be kind of a no-go for
some people so yeah downdraft is
definitely helpful in that capacity that
you're talking about it's just that it
is naturally limited and how well it can
cool the CPU itself because I mean it's
just it's less surface area there's
there's fewer fins they're not as tall
the fan is probably smaller and it might
be weaker as well because a lot of the
time draft coolers really
for like either a box cooler or ITX
cases and in that capacity they don't do
well on a full tower where you might be
pushing the overclock harder so the
answer is it depends and it depends on a
lot of things but you know would it be
smart to use one I mean in some
applications yes like in an ITX box
especially where you don't have access
to a lot of air and you especially don't
have access to a lot of air near the vrm
components because you're really just
trying to get some air into the box in
general because it's so small all you
need is something and then the CPU
cooler if it's down drives will take
care of pretty much everything around it
including you in the backside of the GPU
you get rid of some of that radiative
heat although the CPU is going to be
sucking it in so the CPU will be warmer
but the CPUs are also more tolerant of
high temperatures than than a GPU but
also VRMs are pretty tolerant of high
temperatures as well more so so you had
one last question here that you had was
about the life of the components you're
not mistaken you said would result in
longer life I'm not mistaken but we're
talking about let's talk about the
capacitors those are typically rated for
say 5000 hours of use at 105 degrees
Celsius some of them are as bad as 2,000
are 2.5 two and a half thousand hours of
use at 105 C or some or two and a half
thousand at eighty degrees Celsius or 85
so it's either a 80 or 85 but that's
obviously once you get into the 80s for
rating the capacitors and fewer than
5,000 hours absolutely longer capacitor
life is something you should be thinking
of and a downdraft cooler would probably
aid in that but if you're looking at
something like 105 C at 5,000 hours as
long as the capacitors are reasonably
cooled and it's pretty hard to get a cab
to 105 C as long as the unless you have
like we did it with a front-mounted CLC
no exhaust and no other intake we were
able to achieve that but just you know
don't be an idiot like we were
intentionally doing for purposes of test
and you'll be fine so yeah definitely
every 10 degree Celsius increase on
capacitor is
kind of like an almost exponential and
how much it decreases your life the
capacitor itself MOSFETs take a whole
lot of heat talking 120 550 C chokes
inductors same thing can also take
hundred twenty-five hundred fifty C
depending on what you're using so caps
the only thing to really be worried
about and those hopefully aren't too bad
demand which motherboard you choose but
we've been able to get them hot anyway
yeah down draft coolers are good in
situations where it's a concern but if
you have airflow in general in that part
of the case you'll be fine
next question especially if you need a
cooler CPU which is typically as doable
downdrafts photonics photonics says
asked us on discord slapping it in here
for this for that dank exposure would
increasing the die size of a CPU
increased cooling capability by
spreading out the heat more for example
in James $0.02 recent video he stacks
for 480 radiators and achieves about
ambient temperatures with his GPU while
the CPU and on deleted was still in the
70s I remember hearing in the past with
a nasty n that GB is run cooler dude a
bigger die size and so less
concentration of heat or something like
that so though or something like that
part is right yeah in the past we've
definitely talked about how I don't I
think I was probably talking about a
comparison between two similar GPUs
where the die size was significantly
different and in that situation yeah a
larger die might help but here's the
thing there are a lot of variables here
and transistor density impacts this a
lot so if all things are equal if we're
talking about like basically the same
component but a larger die and density I
mean like all the the transistor count
all that stuff is equal so basically
have the same component blown up then
the larger one will dissipate heat
better it's got a larger surface area to
spread it and and the cooler won't have
to deal with as high of a concentration
of heat in a small area so it's almost
like it kind of depends on the amount of
power you're generating per square
millimeter almost is a good way to think
about it
we're the more power if you have like a
250 watt component and it's a really
small dive which is a large die and all
other factors are equal then a larger
die we'll deal with less limitations and
how the heats being dissipated that said
there are a lot of those scenarios
realistically in the real world a
smaller die has different components and
fewer transistors may be less active
areas of the die for cash or is if you
look at like a block diagram of a CPU or
GPU you'll see the different areas on
the die or it might be CC axes might be
cores like a cache and depend what
components have been removed on the
smaller dies to get that smaller die
size it's not really a linear comparison
to just straights a bigger die cooler
but bigger die cooler in the instance
where bigger dives poorer die are equal
for the most part as far as JS JS
content you're talking about so if he
had I didn't watch it but I I'm sure
it's good though I'd like his videos
when he does stuff like that if he had a
CPU in the seventies and a GPU at a meet
you can't really compare them they're
different architectures they are the
different components they have different
active diarrhea's they have different
process maybe by different companies
consume different amounts of power so
can't really linearly compare them
especially when considering one's got
interfaces like Tim or solder to go
through as well in addition to an IHS so
way different thermal characteristics
between the two I wouldn't compare those
numbers because it's not really
comparable but I had a note here from
VSG of thermal bench as well vs she's a
brilliant guy with regard to anything to
do with thermals and testing and if you
don't know who he is he writes for
techpowerup as well sometimes so I
talked to him about this question as
well and he pointed out that as we enter
sub 10 nanometer EUV or extreme
ultraviolet lithography for making
components for making silicon precision
of the masking used for the gates will
also impact heat dissipation but
otherwise all the other stuff I said all
the variables of what is on that die
makes the biggest impact to answer your
question very simply yes a bigger dies
cooler if the two
are very similar and that's been the
case sometimes when we toss stuff also a
multi dye approach is really interesting
to you like what Andy's done with Rison
and what looks like it'll happen with
navi and future MCM a multi-chip module
and video components that's that's got
its own thermal characteristics because
now you have multiple devices with an
interconnect and so the heat may be kind
of like hot spotted in different areas
as each component processes whatever
it's doing it's very interesting though
hopefully that helps a little bit I
don't know if I I think I directly
answered that kind of next question
sleepy time sleepy time it says wonder
how many weeks that I wonder how many
weeks that garbage AIO will sit on the
bench and pieces this person is
referring to the m22 we took apart
clearly it's not on the table anymore
however allow me to introduce you to
this this was a bit of a nightmare to
assemble on the stream for a number of
reasons so I want to bring it up we have
a full content piece coming that like
compresses basically three hours of
Maxine's youtubes and testing some fans
into something that makes more sense so
if you did catch the stream though the I
found out after the stream it was still
kind of leaking overnight so tightened
everything all the fittings are all
tight the tubes are clamped on with two
zip ties they didn't include anything
else with that but it was still leaking
and it was not leaking out of the tubes
the fittings are connecting anything
that is kind of external to the cooler
so we let it sit overnight
I drew kind of a water level here came
back the next day and it dropped like
another I don't know half inch on this
marker and looking at it closely there
are actually four screws on top of this
thing up there so there's four screws
here and two of them we're not really
tight at all and to it the other two
were maybe about one full turn away from
being what I would consider acceptable
tightness or torque so if you caught the
stream this is just a teaser to what
we're doing putting together after it's
all tested and everything but basically
a lot of the leakage problems
from the fittings kind of being a pain
in the ass and some of my own mistakes I
made I certainly was not flawless in
that stream but it was fine I liked it
it was a lot of fun actually but some of
the problems outside of external to user
error were these four screws is not
being tight enough and it just it sort
of leaked leeches out of the cap on the
top and proceeds to drip down the fins
which is a real nightmare to clean up I
basically just blasted it with an air
compressor because it's the otherwise
you can't get in there so to answer your
question that that cool that you're
referring to is gone I mean it's in the
box and probably turned into like art or
something but now we have this one and
you can look forward to this I still
need to do some testing on it I realized
a lot of things during like Aptus I mean
being on stream is kind of a lot of
pressure because there's a lot of stuff
that's going on we had an issue where
the stream went out we didn't know why I
had to restart OBS and that fixed it but
a lot of pressure so I forget stuff
which is why we don't stream too often
because it is actually a lot harder to
complete the same objective but it's way
more fun I love interacting with viewers
we're planning to do more streams in the
future so be sure to catch them but it's
honestly it's mostly just like three
hours of me interacting with chat for
the most part so not too exciting to
watch out to the fact that said my point
is there it's a much different
environment than a pre film thing so I
forget stuff and I forgot I really
wanted to connect to quick disconnects
which I'm gonna do after this video
actually so all we that would have
solved a lot of my problems with like
stupid stuff like the order I did the
cap and the the pump cap but reservoir
Peck cab so yeah we're gonna stick these
in there and then expand into radiators
for some additional tabs because people
really wanted to see that anyway that's
cooler on the bench now and that's some
behind the scenes as to what we found
after the stream was over I had time to
look at it more closely let it run
overnight some leakage from
manufacturing stuff some leakage from
fittings kind of sucking the ones that
they shipped with it some leakage from
me screwing stuff up so it was it was
fun though we'll do more of these in the
future I promise
next one final Spartan says do you think
CPUs will ever go back to direct eye
cooling I feel like significant
performance could be gained if direct
eye
we're less risky probably there's two
things to consider here direct eye is
more dangerous in that the now you have
in tow names you have to warranty that
component probably if the user installs
a CPU cooler that is maybe out of spec
like a partner just a partner like one
of the major cooler manufacturers didn't
do the torque calculation correctly or
something or the user say tightens one
side down harder than the other and it
cracks the die that's why it stops
because with direct die you do have risk
of cracking the die even when there's
like a retention kit and everything in
there you can still do it
so I don't think we're going back to
direct die for the manufacturers now
also consider outside of potential
concern where you have a lot more RMA
components because people are cracking
the die on the silicon or scratching off
a small SMD or something like that
outside of those things keep in mind
that the better they make their products
out of the box the less they can segment
their products the less they can sell
you on the next five percent increase in
performance so certainly there's some
some kind of you know maybe planned
obsolescence there but in this
particular instance I can forgive it for
both companies because I mean I wouldn't
trust 90% of users with a pre dealer at
CPU anyway so and the other 10% being
all the people watching this channel
because if you think about people who
are maybe just getting into it
kind of scary they just give them a bare
CPU and then they buy whatever cooler
maybe is not perfectly compatible you
crack the die and have very expensive
parts RMA shubo says why is directx12
underutilized it's been so long since
this new API is launched but games
aren't using and ones which are not
using it they're not taking any
advantage of it why is that I answered
this not too long ago in a nasty end I
don't remember which one it is I'm sorry
but we had a really good response from a
developer who writes for Vulcan and
directx12
engines and he basically was talking
about how difficult it is just I don't
know maybe search direct x12 on the
channel look for nasty and recently in
the last couple of months but
the short of it is directx12 in vulcan
are actually really hard to write for
because it's with DirectX 11 you base
and OpenGL basically all of the
optimization all the shader optimization
the way that the code is processed the
way the different cores are you or the
different functions of the components
GPUs are utilized that's basically
handed off to am the Nvidia and they
build it in their driver team their
driver teams experts on this topic this
is all they do is optimize an engineer
for game software so that it runs well
on their particular video card and
they're really good at it and suddenly
with DirectX 12 in Vulcan you're taking
all that responsibility and you're
dumping it on the head of a game
developer that's probably really limited
on time already they have to focus on
getting the game out the door
optimizations not really a big concern
and so a lot of the time what you'll and
also it takes years to get that kind of
experience also what you see is an issue
where DirectX 12 is sometimes just stuck
well not as much lately but used to be
just stuck on a game for purposes of
marketing today it has dx12 not only a
Microsoft thing to push Windows 10 and
the thing with that is a lot of those
games were just wrapped so it was a
direct x12 wrapper it was still DirectX
11 but it was basically imagine it
having just like you have like the game
and DirectX 11 and then you have a
circle around that that says DirectX 12
and all it is handles the call but it's
not actually DirectX 12 it's not
leveraging any of the resources or
advantages of it so you end up in a
scenario where actually a wrapper for DX
12 has some overhead slightly worse than
the X 11 that's why in a lot of the
original comparisons I think battlefield
is one of them and total war even a lot
of the original comparisons the X 11 and
12 you had an issue where DF 12 was
worse and if not an average framerate
almost always in frame times where you'd
go from say I don't know average frame
time or well yeah I retrained time like
16 milliseconds to occasional spikes
like 300 milliseconds which is awful
that's a third of a second you're
staying at the same frame so yeah that
was part of the problem was I think
turned a lot of people off because the
stuff was just wrapped and it said the
Exile but it wasn't the other one is a
soup
hard to do the actual in vulcan from
game programming standpoint and it's
just i mean it's not the kind of code
they don't only have to worry about
that's the driver developer's job but
suddenly it's not so what i think it's
going to happen is these api's need to
be integrated at an engine level and
it's starting to happen with unreal and
add an engine level the engine
programmers can do a lot of that
challenge tackling of optimizing their
engine in general for the api and those
Endon developers have resources with
nvidia and AMD to further optimize for
the graphics cards and get help from
people who've been doing it for
potentially over a decade at each of
those companies so i think that's kind
of what has to happen is it needs to
come down from an engine level because
it's just it's it's too hard to ask a
game developer to do all of this new
hardware level optimization via software
when they're also trying to make a game
it's a big cost overhead especially when
they probably know how to use DirectX
alone and it might be fine for what
they're doing yeah I have a way better
answer though that was pretty good but I
have a way better answer in a previous
SVN where I read a developer's
responsibility have like one more is it
yes Z no nuke says nothing like making
some sandwiches and sitting down only to
see a new gamers Nexus video I included
this in here because this made me smile
as comp because I'm not a big consumer
of content these days I watch it but
it's not only from like a competitive
standpoint or we're like we'll watch
videos from I mean obviously I watch
stuff just because it's fun too but
watch videos from other channels just to
see what is this car channel doing was
this fashion channel doing whatever what
can be learned from these people outside
of our industry and adopt into our
industry so it makes it harder to watch
stuff just for fun like I used to do but
I remember watching like competitive
Starcraft replays with like husky
Starcraft or watching GSL gstl stuff
like that at 6:00 in the morning before
going to bed and it was my favorite
thing to get some food and then come
back to town and watch youtubers or I
guess it was just youtubers really talk
about professional Starcraft and that
was a lot of fun for me so seeing that
comment they
day but anyway thanks for watching
