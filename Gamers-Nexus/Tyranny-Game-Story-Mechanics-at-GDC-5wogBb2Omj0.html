net and we are at GDC 2016 with obsidian
i'm joined by brian hines we're talking
about tyranny today which is a new game
coming out and before getting into this
content all of our coverage from GDC
2016 is brought to you by raw fury Brian
what can you tell me about tyranny
better then of course the name sounds
really promising so he turning is always
fun of course it's a tyranny we wanted
to go with a different style of RPG that
we've made in the past and really wanted
to focus on story in a world where evil
had one so that's where the tyranny is
said you are actually a character who is
part of the army that conquered the
world underneath the evil overlord and
your choices in the game affect how that
develops further like do you embrace the
evil do you enjoy that experience or do
you try to maintain your own integrity
and be a hero still in a world
surrounded by evil people which will be
a challenge and it looked sort of like
pillars yes we're using the same engine
as pillars of eternity we took the
foundation they created we're building
on top of it very cool so sort of
similar RPG system and
character-building what can you tell us
about the character building so far so
we have the same foundations at Pilar's
but we're using a classless RPG system
this uses us you space skills so as you
get new equipment and abilities in the
game you build skills and become more
powerful gain levels with your party but
even more than that we're talking about
our character creation during the
beginning of the game I talked about the
army's conquering the world you actually
shaped the world through the character
creation decisions you make so each time
you come back and create a new character
you get a different experience on the
environment and we actually saw that
reflected in the demo where originally
helps a guy and then later the name of
the town actually changed what can you
kind of recap for the viewers of that
scenario so there's an area in the world
that used to be the fertile land the
breadbasket of the area and powerful
magic destroyed it during the conquest
and based on your choices that's how
powerful that magic was so if you are
more lenient it becomes the remains its
name is plains gate and if you're more
vindictive like maybe me you can
actually destroy the land people call it
half gate instead and one of the cool
things we saw going back to half gate
and getting into some combat so to two
main points that I want to bring up here
one was
you were mentioning how in some games if
you avoid combat you obviously don't
really progress in those skills so what
are you doing to combat that here so we
really want players to be able to play
the game their way and make their
choices so during conversations based on
the skills you developed you can
actually use those skills to intimidate
enemies or trick them with different
skills to make them run away or
sometimes you can get one enemy to turn
on the rest of his allies you get an
advantage during combat and what do you
do that you still gain experiences
though you had fought those enemies so
you don't lose out for making choices
and conversations that allow you to
avoid combat right and the second thing
was the high dukan spell yes yes one of
things were adding to tyranny is the
ability for the player to craft their
own spells and I mean that's one example
that that we showed you but we talking
more about spell crafting later on as we
get closer to release cool and that is
new that was not on pillars right
exactly it's a brand new system we've
added for tyranny very cool what can
tell us about the world at a sort of
top-level what you know what is the
planet we're on what's going on in our
surroundings so the world is known as
Thurrott asst it's basically started out
various kingdoms and warring factions
and the evil overlord saw all this chaos
and decided that the world be better if
everyone followed the law is law so
basically gathered armies and marched
across the world and conquered
everything and now the the game is set
in the last corner of the world that the
conquering armies invaded and just as
the conquest is about to complete
something happens that you'll see when
you play the game we'll talk about more
in terms of the gameplay mechanics for
things we can discuss right now so we
saw four characters on screen when you
were doing the demo what else can you
sort of tell us about the how people
play the game so it's a real time with
pause combat systems you have all the
tactical options that pillars had we we
focus on a four player party because it
allows you to really focus on what your
characters doing in focus on the
high-level strategy we add a lot of
companion AI functionalities so that you
can either micromanaging control every
single person's actions depending on how
detailed you want to get or you can
really allow the AI to control your your
party members your companions and focus
on controlling your character and using
most of your skills effectively
you can what about a tentative launch
date anything like that is it this year
2016 is what were saying right now okay
so 2016 that's some time at this in the
future right yes soon hopefully before
half life 3 thank you for watching and
definitely before half life 3 yeah
that's that's probably fair to say check
the links in description below for full
information for the article all of that
and we will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
