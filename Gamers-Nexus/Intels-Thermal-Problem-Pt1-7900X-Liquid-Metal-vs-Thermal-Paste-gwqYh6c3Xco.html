liquid metal in today's content that's
not really viable not on mass but we
hope that this testing will help prove
the significant thermal detriment faced
by Intel's high-end desktop CPUs for
using low-end thermal compound we're
focusing in part one of this testing on
the 7900 X and will expand testing
shortly here after Intel has all of the
overclocking Headroom in the world on
their CPUs but the usage of a poor
thermal interface material means that
much of this is lost to thermal
limitations ignoring overclocking even
mainstream users must also buy
higher-end coolers often 280 millimeters
or up just to keep temperatures
reasonable within a case especially
while still considering noise with
better thermal media Intel could reduce
the hidden cost of the cooler and allow
users to operate at lower noise levels
this video is brought to you by the be
quiet dark bass pro 900 white Edition
the DBP 900 marks a return to full tower
cases equipped with ample harddrive
support effective noise damping foam
high performance fans and the option to
be inverted into an alternative layout
learn more at the link in the
description below there are valid
reasons for Intel to use the thermal
interface they do they use stuff from
Dow Corning it's pretty good for
longevity it has a high durability to
thermal cycling which is what you care
about you care about making sure that
when cycling temperatures rapidly or
on-and-off over many years of use the
interface isn't going to crack and leave
you with a processor that is inoperable
so it's a trade off straight off between
that and something else solder has some
arguments for and against it we don't
have any actual data to back any of
those up because Intel doesn't publish
those AMD doesn't publish those no one
talks about it but there are
alternatives to what Intel uses now and
either better thermal paste or a solder
of some kind or something like that but
ultimately the current method is
limiting Intel CPUs in overclocking
which is really unfortunate because they
are strong overclockers and even beyond
that if you look at the cooler
requirements there's
hidden cost with until high-end CPUs
where if you want it to operate with
relative silence you really have to
start investing in coolers it more so
than if you bought well more so than if
you replace the compound with liquid
metal like we did or just something
better than the stuff that's on there
now and two Intel's credit there may be
reasons they've gone with Tim outside of
just it's cheaper maybe there's some
kind of engineering challenge maybe
there's something to do with the various
grants that are afforded by the
governments for things like being
environmentally friendly which Tim is
going to be you're actually more
environmentally friendly than solder
maybe there's something there but from
an enthusiasts perspective there's
better performance that could be had out
of the CPUs and there's better Tim out
there so we're gonna explore that today
walk through the steps of deleting the
processor applying liquid metal and
showing the differences and again we're
not asking Intel to go and start
applying liquid metal to their CPUs it's
just it moves around too much it's not
really good for shipping it kind of
needs to be replaced every now and then
but this is as a stand-in for an
alternative like solder which is a lot
more realistic is currently used on AMD
CPUs has been used by Intel in the past
and that's kind of what we're using as
an analog today for a high-end interface
so we walked in through that now
deleting we use their Bauer's deal with
dime 8x we are using that for some other
upcoming content as well and it'll be
part two of this exploration reusing a
conductor not thermal grizzly material
for the liquid metal and we'll have more
information on the testing process in
the article below but the big part is
that we're using prime95 and blender
prime95 thermal or power cycles rather
so when it power cycles you'll see
stepping where the thermal charts will
kind of go like this then like that and
then maybe back down and that's because
they are cycling power loads it's pretty
predictable you can tell it what to do
so that's a good test or something
intensive blender is a good workload
that's constant power throughput the
same power throughput the same workload
type the same everything so blender is
really consistent for that so we got a
bit of each and we'll be exploring the
thermals from each of those types of
tests we're starting with the most
abusive and exaggerated test and then
we'll move on to blender and lower
frequency testing with prime95 running
at 4.5 gigahertz and with a one-point
175 voltage ID we end up throttling on
the CPU that's cooled with Intel stock
thermal paste some cores are hitting the
t.j.maxx at 105 C causing power
throttling that we can show on our
current clamp and we will momentarily
keep in mind that the thermal
differences here would be shown to an
even greater degree if we hadn't been
thermal throttling with the Tim on the
CPU still we're at 99 Celsius Peak
steady state temperature with Tim and 85
to 86 degrees Celsius with liquid metal
and again that's ignoring the fact that
the Tim version is thermal throttling so
the differences would be greater and
either way this is a reduction of 15c
now without the thermal throttling
consideration and we'll show more on
that later moving to a three hundred
sixty millimeter thermal take flow
radiator doesn't appear to help us much
when using Tim as we're still throttling
and hitting a hundred Celsius
temperatures but the throttling isn't as
bad and we'll show that in our frequency
plot but still the CPU is at 100 degrees
Celsius average the three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator helps in other
instances which will show more in part
two of this content but that's just not
enough here
Prime is abusive and we can survive with
blender sometimes but that's about it
liquid temperatures are sort of a
question mark for us our original
hypothesis was that liquid temperatures
would increase with greater thermal
transfer ability between the IHS and die
but we're not measuring that here
there's only one of a dozen tests in
this particular plot but we've got many
more coming in part two and that has the
liquid temperature is roughly matched
and that's when the power load is a
lower shown here the cpus are thermal
stepping along with primes power cycling
with each relatively aligned data
alignment is handled prior to number
averaging anyway but you can see the
step in here the liquid temperature
ramps faster on the 7900 acts with Tim
as does the core temperature and when we
look at the power chart we're showing
severe throttling on the unit with Tim
but applying liquid metal brought down
our temperatures enough to avoid
throttling as a result of thermals so we
can see these boosts and power
consumption figures as measured at the
EPS 12-volt cables because of the
limitation that existed with the Tim
unit this frequency plot shows the
severity of the problem we're able to
achieve higher clocks and hold them with
liquid metal which speaks to the
uselessness of Intel's Tim when
overclocking it's unfortunate too
because intel has the best overclocking
candidates right now and performance
jumps as much as 30% when running our
CPUs with high o C's and liquid metal
and we can easily get another 200
megahertz out of the clock by switching
thermal interfaces so it's a real shame
to see Intel squandered their advantages
in an increasingly competitive market
this is something they're good at
overclocking is one of their strengths
and yet when AMD is competing fiercely
in taos to has parts that are choking
their own advantages and needlessly so
so that's disappointing to see it's
unfortunate that you need increasingly
better coolers and louder outputs just
to hold on to these higher clocks that
are so easily attained it's not like
we're doing liquid nitrogen overclocking
here we're not doing anything exotic
we're just increasing the multiplier and
the VI D both to levels that are
perfectly within reason but in order to
sustain them you need loud or big liquid
coolers and it's just not necessary and
it's unfortunate the liquid metal shows
that it's not necessary moving on to our
4.5 gigahertz overclock with a 1.17 5
voltage ID we couldn't reasonably pass
the blender render without the help of
maglev fans and a 360 millimeter cooler
we otherwise entered throttled territory
this is especially true if you consider
that we're testing on an open-air bench
at around 24 degrees Celsius that's like
room temperature testing in a case you'd
easily bring an internal ambient
averages up to 40 C that's why this is
important
that's why we're trying to convey to
Intel to use better interface whether
it's Tim or something else the CPU has
all the potential in it but it'll
thermal throttle quickly if using the
stock Tim its squandered and we're not
sure why it could be processed or it
could be money but Intel has done better
materials in the past and they can do it
again looking at the numbers we're at 63
degrees Celsius with liquid metal and a
280 millimeter cooler with NZXT stock
fans they're not even very good fans
with thermal paste the CPU was hitting
73 degrees Celsius on a 360 millimeter
cooler with three corsair maglev fans at
max rpm these are some of the best fans
you can buy on what is approaching the
unreasonably large cooler sizes and the
cooler setup was nearing 60 DBA during
testing even when it passes it's just
unacceptably loud and that's a 10 degree
difference that favors the liquid metal
mod when using a worse cooler with worse
fans that's what this is about Intel is
creating a hidden cost to its CPUs more
noise and more money to get things
cooled under overclocks
and it's awfully unfortunate it's just
painful to see such a good overclocking
CPU such a huge advantage thrown away
the CPUs can overclock exceptionally
well to the point that they get fiercely
competitive more than they already are
and it's just squandered just to prove a
point let's lower the clocks closer to
stock just so there's no argument from
Intel's End or anywhere else that we're
doing something unreasonable by
overclocking so looking now at a locked
frequency of 3.6 gigahertz all core and
locking voltage to 1.15 VI D yes it's a
little higher than necessary but it
won't change and that's the point using
auto testing for example you can see
improvements but Auto moves voltages
around based on need it moves a lot of
things around based on need so fixing
the voltage to 1.15 VI D means that we
can completely control the environment
that's what we're going for anyway with
this chart we're showing that liquid
metal dragging down temperatures to
around 68 degrees
yes with the liquid temperatures now
more evenly matched so this makes a bit
more sense we think that this liquid
temperature difference in the original
chart might have something to do with
some sort of nonlinear tripping point
for either the cooler or the CPU or CPU
temperatures of more than a hundred
degrees Celsius start to cause some sort
of runaway scenario we're really not
sure we've been talking to people we
don't know why the liquid Delta was so
great in some tests that were heavily
overclocked but not in the others but
either way that's something we'll
explore more in part two of this content
which is coming out within a few days
regardless the difference here is eighty
degrees Celsius on the Timm unit versus
68 degrees Celsius on the liquid metal
unit and with the X 62 and that's
without any overclock in mind you that's
a reduction of 12 degrees Celsius again
without overclocking without serious /
volts and as we saw earlier the
temperatures further scale with higher
power through put liquid temperatures
here are with a margin of test error and
variance but as we begin the overclock
and I / volt that starts to run away a
little bit
next is blender so this is another chart
this one's continuing the lower clock
3.6 gigahertz fixed and 1.15 VI D test
with blender where we see about a 10
degree celcius improvement on the liquid
metal version liquid temperatures are
again with an error so are effectively
equal we're about 51 to 52 degrees
Celsius measured on the liquid metal
version of the CPU with a 70 900 X at
about 61 degrees Celsius on the Tim
version another 10 degree difference for
a lower frequency lower voltage workload
so even without overclocking you've got
advantages that are significant here's a
look at power consumption for this test
we're consistently drawing 212 to 214
watts down the EPS 12 volt cables with
Tim and running about 205 on the liquid
metal mod we need to do more testing to
understand if this is just normal
variance and error or if this is more
repeatable this could be a power leakage
reduction like we saw the Vega Frontier
Edition and an efficiency improvement or
it could be within margin of error we're
not sure right now here's the test over
time results are consistent we're at
about 50 to 52 degrees Celsius
steady-state with liquid metal and
6262 Celsius steady-state with Tim and I
hope I'm making my point clearly here I
mean again Intel this isn't just about
overclocking it's not just about
appealing to your 1% of users who push
these CPUs as far as we might or as far
as someone more extreme like their Bower
might or build Zoid might this is about
doing something that makes your products
better tap into its performance in a
greater way and improves the brand
credibility to throw a buzzword in there
to a point where it stops some of the
criticism and from a mainstream user
perspective you can now reduce the
requirement of the cooler down to
something like a 240 or a high-end air
cooler get rid of the high rpm loud fans
that I mean I'll put a chart on the
screen we do cooler testing the coolers
I've highlighted now are the ones that
would do best with these CPUs at the
noise levels that were showing on this
chart and it's just it's louder than
necessary it's more expensive than
necessary so now your parts that have
been criticized for price even if it's a
fair price perhaps have a hidden cost of
an extra X dollars for a better cooler
that's a serious consideration for
mainstream non enthusiast users but a
lot of buyers of these products are
enthusiasts or a lot of buyers of these
products are workstation users and they
have either noise concerns or just why
would you spend more than you should
concerns so we're not asking Intel to do
a liquid metal for their CPUs but it'd
be nice to see either an improvement in
the thermal interface to use maybe a
different one from the Dow Corning stuff
that sees now or a consideration of
going back to solder which would solve
all these problems you'd put there
Bauer's dealin time eights out of
business unfortunately but I mean I
spoke with their Bower about that at
Computex and even he was like hey man
that would make my job a lot easier so
I'm ok with that
everyone wants to see better interface
and Intel although our contacts say they
listen and I appreciate that you know
who you are thank you for listening it
just
doesn't get that far up the chain so we
decided to try and prove a point here D
lid stuff uses liquid metal as the
analog to a better material and show the
potential for improvement show where
these CPAs can go I mean again I can't
talk about all the data today but we're
seeing at least 100 megahertz
improvement across the board and over
clocks and in a couple cases we were
getting an extra 2 to 300 megahertz by
going to liquid metal and we could even
drop the cooler garment down so that's a
big deal you're talking four point eight
Giga Hertz which is four point five and
yeah you can push the voltage a bit
higher to because now you can go up to
one point two five or one point two four
but that increases the power throughput
that increases the temperature that
increases the the thermal requirements
of the cooler in terms of what it can
handle so that's what this comes down to
is with a better interface like liquid
metal you can overclock higher you can
keep the CPU cooler than the lower
overclock and it'll be quieter and the
cooler will be cheaper so guys it's like
you win in every category by doing this
I don't know
that's so yeah anyway obviously we're
still traveling or at least traveling
again and I should say I'll be back home
soon and Andrew will be home soon he'll
be editing videos soon we'll have a lot
more on this topic so subscribe if
you're not already you can go to
patreon.com/scishow and access to helps
out directly it's a it's a big help at
this point because we do these types of
videos and I mean again I'm not trying
to like make enemies with these
companies but this it just seems like
such an easy thing to improve your
product in significant ways even just on
the media side think of the praise you
would get think of the reviews with the
higher overclocks people just over talk
to the highest they can get benchmark it
and review based on that clock and based
on stock if suddenly you can go two or
three hundred megahertz higher even 200
megahertz higher that's a big deal so
especially when you have a competition
now like real competition
for the first time in years anyway yeah
patreon.com slash game sexist helps that
directly subscribe for more thank you
for watching hopefully will not be
shooting in a hotel room soon I'll see
you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
