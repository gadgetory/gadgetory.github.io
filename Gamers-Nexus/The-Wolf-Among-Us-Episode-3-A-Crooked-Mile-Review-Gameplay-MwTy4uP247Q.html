nexus dotnet talking about the wolf
among us episode 3 a crooked mile the
wolf among us is an adventure series
from Telltale Games and spaced off the
fables comics universe so episode 3
marks the midpoint in the series and
really at this point we're seeing a lot
of the conflict from episodes 1 and 2
starting to develop instead of all of
these shocking moments that we're used
to in for example the end of episode 2
this is more like okay well this is
what's happened and now let's explore
why it's happening so i think the
episode 3 particularly explores the
characters relationships and develops
not only the relationships that we see
between between bigby wolf the
protagonist and snow white but also some
of the other characters that you might
not think at first would have as big of
a role so we're talking about Holly
Grendel the woodsman and so on and so
forth there are a couple of standout
scenes in the wolf among us the
beginning in the end they're kind of
bookends because there are two big
conflicts that happen in both of those
scenes it's interesting at first because
you're starting with a scene where
they're supposed to be a lot of well
there's supposed to be some empathy and
they're supposed to be some sort of
tension building there but at the end
it's more of a chance for Big B to sort
of unleash his wolf self and give
players the opportunity to do that
finally there is that moment where that
fury can come out and in that first
scene it's more like he has to sort of
hold that back a little and also think
of the others who are around and then so
I really liked how it the series or how
the episode started and finished there
are also a couple of mechanical
improvements to the quick time generated
fight scenes that makes all the physical
stuff better this time around I also
want to mention that the music there
were a couple of moments where that
really was heightening the discussions
that were happening between characters
and just adding to the overall tension
of things something like that usually
doesn't go noticing games so it's good
to see that you know just be a part of
the element and especially for something
like noir where
you know it's not just the the shadows
it's not just the the angles that the
cameras are using theirs there are more
elements like that and musics one of
them so I like what what's being done
here in the series about that just a
couple of mix that I have first of all I
think that some of the dialogue options
were presented to quickly so I had to
make decisions faster than I could
actually process and some of the actual
dialogue options there were a lot of lot
of expletives and I'm not saying that
there can't be is just it seemed kind of
a natural at the point that they were
presented in the dialogue just didn't
seem it was timed exactly with with how
the other characters were talking even
though there are some issues that I have
with dialogue I think that it's it's
really furthering along the story and
it's also heightening some of those
tensions that we're seeing between the
characters so even though I have to make
it a decision a little bit more quickly
and it's almost a blind guess for me
really it's it's at that point where Big
B has to think quickly on his feet and
be like okay well I gotta get something
done it but I also have to make sure
it's not going to get somebody killed
not that I haven't done that yet the
overall escalation of this conflict is
going to really come out in episode 4
and I think that that you know getting
everything right from the perspective of
the character relationships in a crooked
mile was the right call for them for
telltale games to make here and there's
a lot of desperation that we're already
starting to see in Big B and snow white
as well so I think this is setting up a
greater conflict that will be really fun
to crack it's sort of losing that noir
feel from the first episode in that yeah
we're not really looking specifically at
a murder any more it's more about a
series of conflicts I don't again I'm
not trying to give this away and it's
about something greater than just Big B
and you know a perpetrator and a victim
it's about the overall Fabletown and so
by introducing more of the characters or
giving them greater roles as the series
progresses i think that that naturally
develops the conflict well so yeah
that's pretty much about all i wanted to
say here about a crooked mile so go
ahead and check out gamers nexus dotnet
