be taking a look at the V RMS on the
crosshair six hero which is the top of
the line board for a m4 from Asus it
costs around one hundred two hundred and
fifty dollars which for a m4 is actually
a really high price point but if you
compare it to like Intel motherboards
it's sort of upper mid-range
in terms of price point whereas the
feature set is off it offers is actually
really really good so we will only be
going in detail over the VR ends as well
of pointing out some interesting little
extras for overclocking that this
motherboard includes as it is an rog
board which is sort of the overclocking
centric division of Asus so with that
out of the way let's get straight to the
vrm the vcore vr v core vr m is this
part of the cpu v RM right here so you
have one two three four five six seven
eight phases for your V core and the
other four phases right next to that are
the SOC voltage so that's the horizon
system-on-a-chip part of the CPU and
that is basically Rison integrates a lot
more of the sort of motherboard
functionalities into the CPU so you have
the usual the integrated memory
controller as well as a PCIe as well as
some PCIe connectivity but it also
integrates m dot 2 u dot 2 USB 3.1 audio
and super i/o so you have a lot of
things built right into the chip that
would usually have been supplied by the
motherboard so that's why this is no
longer which is why you have recore and
the SOC voltage instead of say system
agent like you have on Intel boards
where that's literally just or a GPU
voltage is the equivalent for Z 270 so
yeah that's the SOC voltage and that's
made up of four phases as you can
clearly see up there the controller for
the entire vrm is this chip right here
and that is a asp
one 4:05 it belongs into the digi+ line
of Asus parts and it is a custom part
made for Asus by international rectifier
there is no public datasheet available
for it however I can tell you that it is
a four plus two phase voltage controller
and we've seen it on some previous ROG
boards on the EZ 270 side as well as
possibly even before that so I wouldn't
like I haven't seen the older ROG board
so I can't really tell you about those
now then this is a 4 + 2 phase voltage
controller and as I've already said the
vcore is 8 and the SOC is 4 phases so
Asus does have to use a doubling scheme
for to achieve the phase count that the
motherboard actually comes with this is
done using international rectifier ir35
99 ICS which you can find on the back of
the board unfortunately I won't be
showing those to you and those basically
take one PWM signal in and they cut the
frequency in half and split it between
two phases
so essentially you you get like a proper
doubling scheme it's not something like
where you hook up one driver Mothe one
driver chip to two MOSFETs or while two
phases which doesn't really achieve the
the same effect as multiple phases so
this vrm is comparable to a true eight
phase of the rme until you really really
start cranking up the frequency because
the International rectifier 3599 doubler
is top out at 800 kilohertz switching
frequency output so you can't actually
go above 800 kilohertz switching
frequency not that that should really
matter as most motherboard ship at 200
to 300 kilohertz and really really
cranking up the switching frequency
doesn't really net you any gains even in
extreme overclocking scenarios as vrm
like high-end of erm these days with you
know high phase counts like eight phase
is doing 800 kilohertz can handle
transient loads very very well as is so
there really shouldn't be a reason to
worry about the fact that this erm tops
out at 800 kilohertz compared to some
other designs which might top out higher
for the same given phase count
now then if we take a look at the actual
MOSFETs that Isis is using which are
these chips right here these are Texas
Instruments the next fad so these
integrates to both the high side and the
low side MOSFET and the part number for
these is CSD 8:7 350 these are rated to
do 40 amps at 125 degrees centigrade and
go up to 1.5 mega Hertz switching
frequency so they are very like very
very nice parts they are extremely
efficient achieving 90% efficiency at
around 25 amps they do of course drop in
efficiency as you approach 40 amps they
do not improve their current throughput
as you lower the operating temperature
as they are packaged limited not silicon
limited so basically you can run them at
125 degrees just the same as you can run
them at like 20 degrees not that they
should run at 125 degrees as the DRM is
a you know with the phase count that
Asus has gone for this vrm is capable of
supplying 320 amps on the vcore voltage
so you should never actually be reaching
that 40 amps per phase limitation that
this vrm design has here and as such you
should never really get that hot so you
know very nice job from Asus on the vrm
this is perfectly capable of handling
any air-cooled overclocking water-cooled
overclocking even ln2 cold overclocking
this really shouldn't have any issues
interestingly enough this is also the
same exact erm design that you would see
on a loss of z2 70 rog board where it is
unsurprisingly a lot more overkill than
it is here because then is an 8 core and
therefore tends to be more power hungry
as you really crank up the crank up the
overclocks
the SOC uses the exact same offset and
so ends up with a 160 amp power
capability also at 125 degrees so really
this vrm right here is really really
overkill and especially the SOC par at
160 M is kind of ridiculous and I am
kind of suspecting that the reason why
the
system-on-a-chip section of the VRM is
so like capable of delivering such high
current is that in the future when we
start seeing rising based AP use the GPU
portion of those will run off of the SOC
voltage not the V Corps and there's a
good chance that some of the integrated
GPS we will be seeing later down the
line might actually be very very
powerful both in terms of power draw as
well as performance so the high phase
counts that you see on Zen motherboards
compared to say like V 270 which usually
only uses two phases for the eye GPU it
can be you know can probably be
explained by the difference in the GPU
cores that will be coming on the AP use
so that covers what powers the CPU so
let's move on to what power is your RAM
ddr4 vrm is located right over here
unfortunately I have no idea what it's
controlled by not that it matters too
much since Ram is very very low power it
is a two phase erm which is actually a
higher phase count than which you will
find on most other m4 board's most other
m4 boards opt for a single phase design
well Asus has opted for a two phase the
MOSFET right here our Nyko semiconductor
which is a budget mosfet maker is one
way to put it
so Nyko semiconductor pa1 6ba
you can't find a datasheet for this
small set but you can find a datasheet
for its predecessor which isn't a whole
lot worse in terms of specifications so
for my calculations I use the datasheet
for the previous version of this MOSFET
not the PE a 16 I use the PE 6 1 6 VA so
yeah which was recommended to me by a
you know by an Asus engineer when I
asked about what the what the part
numbers are here
so this vrm setup using as you can
clearly see 1 2 3 4 MOSFETs is good for
30
four amps thirty four amps at 125
degrees centigrade and you know is
ridiculous overkill for ddr4 as ddr4
pulls very very little power with most
explain 2 to 4 watts for each stick so
even if you have four sticks in there
you're only going to be pulling around
16 watts at one point - - like 1.3 5
volts so very very low current demand
for the vrm that isis has opted for it's
you know there's no heat sync on this
vrm for a reason it's because it really
doesn't need to do that much work so
nice job from Asus there as well and the
fact that it is a two-phase could leads
to this board having some memory
overclocking advanced some advantage in
memory overclocking compared to other
boards which don't necessarily use a
two-phase design which would then suffer
from slightly worse voltage regulation
so that covers all the V RMS that you
really really need to worry about on
this board interesting little
overclocking feature that asus puts on
their rog series motherboards is this
this little hole inside the CPU socket
so that exists to give you to allow
extreme ln2 overclockers to basically
put a thermocouple in right behind the
CPU to measure if there is - basically
check the condition of the thermal paste
between the ln2 pot and the CPU itself
because sometimes the thermal paste
fails when overclocking and this is a
really good way to detect any major
temperature difference between the CPU
and the ln2 pot which has a thermocouple
which most of those have thermocouples
built in as is already so this allows
you to check the sort of thermal paste
condition because the CPUs own internal
thermal sensors do not work under ln2
as ln2 they're not calibrated to work at
those temperatures so they read all
kinds of random garbage
so yeah you also do get a postcode on
this board there are
power on recess and other you know
useful overclocking overclocker friendly
buttons located lower down on the board
which I can't show you because this is
where the photo ends and that pretty
much covers it for everything you need
