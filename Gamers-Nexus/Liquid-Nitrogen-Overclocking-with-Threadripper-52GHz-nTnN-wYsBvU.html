Ripper event and I'm joined by bill
Alverson and Ahmet Mara we're talking
about thread referred overclocking so
pretty cool stuff this is one of the
first looks at cetera for overclocking
before getting to that this video is
brought to you by synergy the software
that lets you share a keyboard and mouse
between multiple systems if you have
limited desk space and multiple
computers to command that synergy
removes the need for separate
peripherals or a KVM and works as over
the network software use our link below
to get 50% off the basic or pro version
so let's start off with talking about
what you guys achieved earlier in the
demo so for give everyone some
perspective on the base frequency and
then what you ended up overclocking too
so base frequency all four boosts be 3.7
we all core overclocked over 5 gigahertz
yes we got to actually 5.2 gigahertz of
course so 5.2 from 3 point from 3.7
right pretty good and that's all core
all sorts what about a voltage for that
for that we were running at 1 point 6
volts on this part okay and what's out
of box voltage is like if you run it
kind of all cores engaged turbo depends
on the part I think the typical range is
1.2 1.2 board a little bit higher maybe
for single core boost yeah so what about
when you're looking at overclocking the
thread river parts are there any major
differences between this and the
previous rise in series like for items
you need to tune or watch out for it's
actually less things I think you have to
worry about yeah we worked out a lot of
the stuff with a.m. for launch so here
basically probably PCI go to Gen 1 and
if you're going to leave memory 21:33
range you don't have to mess with
anything else so well so gen wanna PCIe
we were talking about that earlier
what's the what's the main benefit from
dropping down to that so right now we're
just not gen 3 stable whenever we want
to run full pot so if you want to run a
higher temperature that might be okay
but I mean the easiest thing to do is
run full pot and so when we're running
at the full liquid nitrogen temperature
if we go to Gen 1 you can have reboot
stability and less less general problems
if you crash you can restart the system
without having to heat it up yeah it's
like it's really great for overtime so
how about I guess you're mostly working
with v4 or something for the voltage
that you're tweaking that's right okay
is there are there any other voltages
that provide a meaningful advantage
either from memory or the CPU okay so if
you run a memory is like 2133 range then
you're fine you can just basically run
PCI gen 1 if you want to go faster on
memory then you probably need to start
bumping up the SOC voltage 1.2 or 1.3
volts is pretty good place to start and
then VDD IO as well the Digi Ram voltage
you want know one three five one four
yeah so one of the if we're running full
pod and we're trying to go over 21 33
like 1.35 or 1/4 is a good place to
start
yeah well what about a server the
Cinebench I guess that was your main
benchmark right that's right you know do
we know what the score was on that
ultimately when one twenty two forty one
forty dollars one hundred twenty two
okay that's a multi-threaded bench so
right for for perspective for anyone who
missed our X 299 coverage the 7900 X ten
core twenty threads I think we we are
not X osseous but we over talked at the
four point four or five and ended up
with I want to say 26 or 27 hundred I
think that's where 69 is so a bit a bit
higher yeah basically yeah cool that's
what you can expect to the base because
I guess then or for the XO see basic
this part actually had base beat set for
Astro just admission mode okay it's
pretty exciting
yeah so for overclocking were you mostly
using rise and master for this stuff
where you guys go into BIOS we're easing
might as a master today yeah yeah we've
had good luck with both options though
so rise and masters the easy option for
you know not having to reboot and all
this sort of thing but there's been
other times where we chose to pick some
base frequency and in BIOS and run with
that and that works equally as well
right alright so yeah but for table
using right semester
and then for the boards here I noticed
this one you're saying as a reference
board right that's our internal called
the whitehaven as the code name it's our
internal reference board and then the
system on the right is Rock production
board so a pre-production ball is a
pre-production you so then for I guess
for some inside perspective to these
things obviously you guys have to have
boards way before the board partners to
actually validate stuff so how do these
uh how much they build the VRMs up on
these things you get better performance
from the aib boards come out for these
we were lucky and so they built them to
have a little bit more Headroom on the
vo room than what TDP would would tell
you so we were pretty lucky on there we
can we can get pretty far on the
whitehaven so obviously on the odm
boards we're not limited by like the SPI
to vrm specification so we can override
that and go much further on voltage yeah
I'd say the big thing is our internal
board let us get started with the
overclocking right and and then at some
point we basically you'll be pass it on
to the OEM to take it the rest of the
way what are you using for the ellentube
pod did you have something custom-made
or yeah so we had a local company in
Austin and so we gave them design
specifications for the socket all to
keep out and all this and so they built
this both kingpin and derp Bower will
have LM two pots available now or very
quickly how cool yeah okay so for now
custom-built I guess just new socket so
yeah what about for other items of note
overclocking thread Ripper in general is
there any new stability issues to look
out for that are different from what you
normally run into a thermic locking or
we look on a m4 we've worked out a lot
of stuff we gave us time to learn and
observe and work on things right so
ultimately for this spend a lot less
growing pains a lot easier to get up and
running so then then it was 4 a.m. for
we basically were able to fix a lot of
stuff on a m4 that can apply here
honestly all we do when we go in is a
PCIe and Gen 1 and then let it rip so
yeah it's porcelain ln2
very cool yeah well thank you guys for
joining me I guess by the time this
video is up tread River should be alive
probably if not our review will be to
check the channel for that thank you
guys bill yeah
comet alright thank you much well thank
you we'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
