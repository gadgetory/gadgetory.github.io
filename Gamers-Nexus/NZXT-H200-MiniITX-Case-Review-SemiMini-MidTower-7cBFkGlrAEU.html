ITX cases we've reviewed thus far it's
roughly the same depth and height as the
micro ATX coarser 280x but a few
centimeters slimmer as we mentioned in
the past making a large SFF case fudge
is the numbers a bit since it
automatically makes air flow better and
installation easier while defeating the
whole purpose of a small form-factor
case people generally build mitx because
they want a small PC so at 26.1 litres
h200 eye has an uphill battle to fight
against truly tiny cases like the eleven
point five liter SG 13 or 14 litre RB
0-3 before that this video is brought to
you by Thermal Grizzlies high-end

high quality thermal compound that
doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to

liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests buy a tube at the link
in the description below and this is NZ
x YZ h 200 i or h 200 a fter this case
originally came out and after the h 700
I came out NZXT did eventually remove
the I suffix for some of their cases
which all it is is the same exact thing
except without the smart device the
smart device adds up $40 to MSRP for
this case so having that I suffix h 200
i is 130 versus $90 for it without the
smart device in general we are almost
always going to default to the no smart
device solution just because the value
the value proposition in general is so
much better from that standpoint we've
heard that NZ XE has improved their
smart device from what they've told us
we haven't yet retested it since the H
700 i but what we're mainly doing here
today is looking at this from the
standpoint of an 82 or $90 case rather
than a 130 plus dollar case with the
smart device so with that in mind it's
got a lot of competition at a similar
price point the main thing though as
with all ITX case
is that it's a very unique setup so with
ITX a bit different than ATX in that
there are so many different ways to
build it because it really only has to
be so small to fit an ITX board and then
the vendors just kind of do whatever
they want out to that this case has
support for one of the tallest tower
coolers that an ITX case reviewed
supports so it's not fully small
form-factor it's technically mini ITX
and that it fits mini ITX solely but it
is a larger case overall now some people
want that if you want it NZXT is making
it for you it's more similar to
something like the Manta or the 280 X or
even though 11 just a smaller version of
it than it is something like the SG 13
or Taku or RB z03 or something like that
that's more properly ITX
but that's okay there are no hard and
fast rules for what companies have to do
it's really up to what you think fits
for your build just know that this is
one of the larger ones we're working
with and that carries with it some
important notes so Friday our testing
will have thermals as always noise is
always the problem though with ITX
is that it's not perfectly scientific so
we can only do so much to control for
the environment typically with a case
like this you'd put on a bigger cooler
this one also supports radiators that
some of the other ITX cases don't so you
can do a top mount or a rear mount
radiator and that would of course give
you better cooling power than what we
have on here which is a downdraft cool
respect for a properly ITX or small
form-factor case and the point is that
thermals for this it would be much
better if we were to change the cooler
but we're trying to control somewhat for
testing just know that you can do a bit
better if you wanted to for your own
thermals anyway as far as the cooling
setup this case is very interesting for
one main reason the H 708 500 cases from
NZ FC not to be confused with the cooler
masters age 500 had a similar perforated
front panel on the sides they also opted
for this exhaust setup so it's a
negative pressure setup there is no
direct intake forced in through a fan
it's all being pulled in just through a
pressure system because the fan on the
back and the top are both exhausting air
which means that air will find its way
in through any
that it can and what that means is that
very interestingly the GPO ends up
particularly cool in the NZXT eh 500 and
even H 200 cases you'll see our thermals
today the reason for that as we'll show
you in a bit
is because as this is negative pressure
it's pulling air in through these
perforated holes in the front it's
pulling air in through the bottom and
especially the bottom where the power
supply mounts we use an SFX power supply
it's smaller this case supports ATX
power supplies if you wanted because
it's sfx we actually get significant
thermal benefit for the GPU which is
actually really fun data to look at even
if you're not planning to build the ITX
we'll be talking about that today but
first let's go through some of Patrick's
build notes for the case and then we'll
get to the thermals material quality on
the H 200 is high as usual with NZXT e's
current series of cases visually the H
200 is similar to the Aged 700 i but
some aspects are closer to the h 500 the
steel side panel has no push-button
there are two 120 millimeter fans set up
in an exhaust configuration and the top
of the case is flat except for a single
fan mount the cable management bar is
back and is appreciated as is the fact
that it's easily removable with two
screws we mildly criticized the shape of
the bar in the H 700 I but it's less
obtrusive and conforms better to cable
placement in the H 200 I wear H 200
something we also complimented in the H
500 installing and connecting the
motherboard was tricky the H 200 I looks
like a scaled-down version of the H
series design rather than a case built
from the ground up for many idx not all
aspects of its larger counterparts adapt
cleanly to izx boards which are more
varied than ATX for example our board
has SATA and power plugs along the top
edge there's a gap above the motherboard
for routing cables but it's blocked by
the stock fan at the top of the case
this is one advantage of the popular
mini ITX cube design laying the
motherboard flat on top of the power
supply means that all the cables can
easily and cleanly reach all plugs
regardless of layout the major advantage
of this case is size is that it fits
most full-size components
it supports a total of four 120
millimeter fans or 140 millimeter fans
for the two front slots depending on GPU
length there's an ample space for a 240
radiator in the front of the case power
supply clearance is huge and the only
dimension that's obviously cramped is
clearance between the GPU and the power
supply shroud which we'll discuss in the
thermal section we've been pleased to
see the trend of removable fan cages in
cases recently but the H 200s removable
cage is something of an enigma most
cases with fan cage like the H 500 are
unscrewed from inside the case in the H
200 I the thumb screws for removing the
cage are behind the front panel so the
hole very firmly attached front panel
has to be pried off to access them at
that point you might as well not bother
taking out the cage at all although it
could still make installing a radiator
easier we'd rather see a system like the
aged 500 where the front panel doesn't
need to be removed or a cheaper solution
with no fan cage and an easily removable
front panel is in place getting is a
thermal testing now so for additional
task team like we always do we remove
these somewhat superfluous filter on the
top over the exhaust fan just as we did
with the H 500 the reason being that
it's an exhaust fan so you're not gonna
pull Dustin through there it's literally
pushing dust away from it so we removed
it just to see if it impact the thermals
at all it's nice to have though if you
decided to reverse that into a an intake
fan for example so it's good to have it
but it should be removed stock the
negative pressure setup is pretty
effective in the H 500 but we anticipate
a different behavior here due to the
size we did a final test with the top of
the power supply shroud taped off
because after looking at the thermals in
the GP torture section that you'll see
momentarily we found it almost odd to
the point of considering running some of
our tests that the GPU is performing so
damn well because it doesn't have any
intake directed straight at the video
card we thought well maybe it's cuz we
using a short card but no that wasn't it
and eventually what we realized is that
on the bottom of the case the SFX power
supply we use is obstructing so little
of this intake
that a lot of the air can go around the
power supply and just filter up through
the perforated holes in the top of the
power supply shroud so NZXT job well
done on the perforation for the tops of
power splice rod it actually really
works here now the unfortunate side is
that if you did use an ATX power supply
you lose a lot of that benefit so if
possible if any designers are listening
what we'd like to see is maybe consider
a couple extra holes are extended out a
little bit more I know you've got these
rails here if you can maybe get rid of
an inch of them or if you can't put some
holes along the sides of them that would
give just a little bit extra breathing
room for the video card to naturally
pull in through pressure systems the air
that it needs it's very interesting
performance though and shows how
pressure systems work in cases so as
always ITX testing is hard to do in any
perfect fashion we've controlled for our
variables but you could put a much
bigger cooler in here so keep that in
mind either way let's go through the
numbers as it compares to other cases on
our bench average CPU temperature for
torture tests was sixty three point four
degrees above ambient during our primary
torture test and that's with both case
fan setup as exhaust the default
configuration removing the top filter
didn't help and there wasn't a
significant difference in temperature
sixty four point two degrees Celsius
over ambient moving in one of the
exhaust fans to the upper front slot of
the case for a straight front to back
airflow pattern did a bit more and dials
of T over ambient dropped to sixty point
one degrees Celsius there are two front
fan slots so the intake fan was
recycling some air through the empty
slot taping the power supply shroud
raised DT about one degree is a sixty
four point five but it seems the CPU
doesn't heavily depend on air coming
from the bottom of the case at first we
thought it might be somewhat odd that
the top filter would have no effect on
our test bench the h200 when it did have
effect for the Aged 500 but keep a few
things in mind one of them the test
components are completely different so
that changes everything especially
because we're using a tower cooler in
our ATX test and a downdraft cooler for
this one secondly and also somewhat
interesting the two case is the aged 500
h 200 have very different volumes and
the significantly larger volume of the
aged 500 means that
airflow patterns and the pressure
patterns are different as they form in
the two cases so the same sized fans
moving the same amount of air through a
smaller space has a more dramatic effect
to the extent that something like a
filter won't bottleneck us in quite the
same way as we saw at the age 500
compared to other mitx cases CPU delta T
is around the middle of the pack between
the stock SG 13 and SG 13 of the filter
removed we currently use a low-profile
forty seven millimeter tall cryo egg c7
cooler for mitx testing but the h202 I
has 165 millimeters of clearance which
is huge this is the first batch of small
form-factor testing and it's taught us
that there are plenty of cases out there
for ITX that are built with normal tower
coolers in mind like the core v1 the 280
X and this one it's really not fair to
judge the cooling potential of these
cases based on an SF F cooler so we're
already considering revisions for our
next batch of testing but we're going to
go through a couple more cases with this
one just to see what else we can learn
before we do our next iteration next up
torture GPU temperatures our next GPU DT
was forty seven point six degrees over
ambient during this torture test with a
similarly negligible chains resulting
from removing the top filter front
intake made temperature a little worse
since it set up an airflow path that
would only affect the CPU choosing to
move that fan to the bottom front slot
rather than the top front slot would
benefit the GPU more but at the expense
of increasing CPU temperatures taping
over the power slide shroud had a huge
impact raising DT nearly 15 degrees to
60 2.2 degrees Celsius it seems that the
heavy perforation of the PSU shroud
combined with our tiny PSU allows cool
air to travel through the bottom of the
case around the power supply and into
the GPU cooler this is important because
putting an ATX power supply in this case
would have roughly the same effect I'll
be at less extreme we recommended using
a small form-factor power supply in this
case earlier and would stick with it now
friends ext it almost might have made
more sense to give up ATX power supply
support compatibility entirely and just
shrink the shroud instead and the stock
towards your task 40
6dt compares very favorably with the
rest of our test cases the RV's easier
through with optimal fan placement is
the only one that that is able to beat
the h 200 taping the shroud shot made it
perform worse than the rest of the
charge except the cryo rig Taku this can
be a case with surprisingly good GPU
cooling as long as a small power supply
is used and it's understood that cool
air needs to enter the bottom of the
case average GPU temperature during the
3dmark fire strike extreme test was
forty eight point seven degree is just
slightly warmer than the torture test
this is the lowest stock TT we've gotten
a 3d mark portion of our test cpu DT
during blender CB rendering was forty
three point seven degrees respectively
low the airflow path goes directly from
the GPU past the CPU cooler so when the
GPU isn't generating any heat CV
temperatures are more competitive
during the GPU render DVD T was thirty
point seven degrees as in the 3d mark
test that's lower than anything else on
the chart for the same reasons the RM
temperature scale pretty evenly with CPU
temperatures and the age 200 I didn't
change that forty four point one degrees
Celsius delta T over ambient during
torture testing is warmer than the open
air test we did with the Takas drawer
open but cooler than the SG 13 and we
entered the conclusion as always for
these case reviews the only motherboard
form factor that will fit into this case
as my Mini ITX although it is roughly
the size of micro ATX so it's a
consideration and that means that light
coursers to ATX which is a micro ATX
case we find ourselves in a position
where we're saying you know what if this
is exactly what you want we do like the
build quality the thermals are mostly
fine and can be better if you just buy
components that fit the giant
compatibility support for CPU coolers so
it's ok it's there's not at $90 - it's
fine we wouldn't recommend the I version
still yes we know NZXT say they've
improved it but ultimately $90 is
actually a pretty good value and going
over that is entering into territory
where we're approaching the really kind
of higher-end ITX case is almost the
boutique cases so if you want exactly
this size it's fine
we wouldn't feel any buyer's remorse
buying this one for a build that
specifically wants this if you're
looking for more propriety acts that's
where we'd say obviously hard pass it's
so big this case that I mean I think I
still have the Raven on the floor behind
me allow me to demonstrate the size
difference here this is the RBZ 0-3 it
fits the same part as this case for our
testbench
however the NZXT one clearly will fit a
much wider CPU tower cooler and it's got
more radiator support so if those are
things that you need well you can't use
this case if you don't need them this
case is like probably a little under
half the size so that's something to
consider but we do like the h 200 for
its build quality its thermal
performance is pretty good part of it
almost cheating because it's so large
but notwithstanding it is doing well and
build quality is good so the next thing
we'd say is you know what if you're if
this is just the size you're looking for
maybe consider micro ATX or something
and zxe has options there to the age 500
is not that much bigger and we did
actually like that case and it's cheaper
70 bucks so if you're ok with going a
couple steps up in size to maybe like
here instead of here then consider ndx
these other options or other options on
the market in general if you want ITX
and you want a normal shower box i guess
this one's fine so that's what it comes
down to not the most exciting conclusion
but that's a good thing here because it
means that the product wasn't
horrendously offensive like a lot of the
other stuff we looked at last year I
want to say here cases we've looked at
so far this year overall have been
actually pretty damn good so really
exciting to see that see the industry
moving in a direction that is clearly
iterating on their previous designs
improving in a lot of ways so we're
seeing that overall and just then on I
version is a pretty good deal it's just
you know the size thing so consider that
