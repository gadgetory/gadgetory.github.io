world right now this look closely it's
the most played so between the rubber
banding issues texture pop-in static and
dynamic mesh scaling issues and low
frame rate overall the Xbox version of
the game has a long way to go but it's
still leading the charge in sales on PC
alone just for perspective player
unknowns battlegrounds has now sold 30
million copies with peak daily player
count upwards of 2 million on PC
today we're benchmarking pubsey on the
Xbox including a detailed look at
graphics behavior and overall
performance this is done using GM's new
in-house console benchmarking utilities
that we've improved specifically as a
result of this game before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
grizzly makers of the conductor hot
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our temperatures
Thermal Grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydronaut pastes
learn more at the link below and for its
help in improving our benchmarking
utilities we really only have good
things to say about pub G on the Xbox by
which I mean it's it's so flawed and has
such bad performance that it really
helped us fine-tune the test resolution
of our tools that we use so that's good
I guess but we're going to break this
video into a few sections we'll talk
about graphics issues and shortcomings
there some gameplay issues rubber
banding things like that frame rate
performance frame time performance on
the Xbox one X which has frame time
spikes sometimes upwards of 100 to 130
milliseconds when for 30 fps you should
be closer to 33 milliseconds quite
disparate performance so a brief
explanation of the tools here if you
want more details on our benchmarking
tools or not talking about how all of it
works it's all internal but we have some
information top-level in the article
linked in the description below for the
very basics we have some new utilities
in here now that will allow us to
compare frame to frame where are the new
pixels by creating contrast maps with
black and white pixels we can see which
pixels are new versus which are old
which is important because there are no
framerate
our tools for the Xbox you have to make
your own which we did and when recording
framerate what we're basically doing is
analyzing the Delta between the pixel
values frame to frame and sometimes that
Delta gets a little muddy because if you
have things like aliasing or a game like
pub G which just has a mixture of really
odd attempts at optimization poor
optimization overall poor performance
overall and weird frame rates sometimes
when you have all those problems we need
debugging tools which is basically what
the black and white mapping is so that
we can see what's going on
frames a frame and determine is that
some kind of compression artifact ting
from capture is it aliasing of some kind
or is it genuinely just an issue that we
need to talk about so more of that in
the article but let's get into the
basics here we're going to start with
graphics and then we'll get into frame
rate and frame time performance graphics
are easy to start with from the instant
the game was launched it was clear what
we were in for the player character is
displayed in the main menu screen but it
takes a second or so after their
appearance for clothing and textures to
follow even once everything is settled
down when new items are equipped like
the belts or shoes they also take time
to load in and then more time still for
higher levels of detail to load in this
texture pop-in is constant and every
change of location the starting area of
the plane wherever the player walks it
temporarily turns the world into a muddy
brown mess more than it's supposed to be
even so poppin issues are a recurring
theme for the Xbox one X version of pub
G one oddity with the game is that
poppin and LOD scaling often seem to
draw completely new or incorrectly
scaled objects in place of the lower LOD
objects you can see this in the trees in
the distance for example where sometimes
it looks like there's a completely
different mesh as we approach the tree
and get closer to it this is also highly
visible in a scene where we're crashing
through fences with a buggy if we slow
down time which isn't hard seeing as
we're running below 30fps you'll see
that it appears that the static mesh
fence has been replaced with a dynamic
particle match version of the fence and
this would be done typically for
Destruction as tracking dynamic particle
meshes for
the object across the entire game would
likely cost too much in system resources
so swapping out on impact could save on
resource cost it appears as if the
dynamic particle mesh version is scaled
incorrectly though if we freeze frame
you'll see that the replacement is
larger than the static mesh the first
one and that we then rubberband through
it as the fence breaks apart texture
pop-in is the most common issue the
parachute is an easy first seen example
dropping it to the map the parachute
takes several seconds to load its
textures fully and is exhibiting a
normal map issue on the underside of the
parachute this seems to happen mostly
when the camera is at Glanton angles to
the parachute revealing the normal map
artifacting underneath you can see that
in kind of the teal color the specific
set of issues is particularly
embarrassing for pub G seen as the
parachute is an object that's only seen
once in the game at the very beginning
and then it's gone for the rest of the
match texture pop-in issues can
basically be seen everywhere we see them
on cars like landing for example and
seeing a car we see them on the ground
at the start of the game you can see the
texture resolution kind of loading and
unloading as the player count changes
bridges while skydiving also have
texture poppin and some kind of LOD
scaling in general that sometimes seems
a bit odd buildings have their own popin
issues tree alpha textures change and
plenty more there are also problems with
the environment poppin like when we
observed parts of the world
failing to draw which seems like some
kind of kollene bug or something like
that because you can pan around from
inside the plane and see that there's
just a bit of almost calling lag as it's
drawing the world underneath where the
plane was previously occluding that
world this isn't really a big deal as
it's not part of the game where it
actually matter you're not competing yet
but it just further illustrates the
incomplete nature of pub G particularly
on the Xbox one X where it's still
lagging behind in version number it's
not just textures of course playing on a
fiber connection even we've noticed
severe rubber banding that would
indicate a server-side network or
synchronization issue this is partly
visible when driving through
destructible objects as the static
meshes again are swapped with particle
meshes but it's even more visible in
occasional combat scenarios in this
example we punched a lagged out link
that player to death and then attempted
to end
the garage with a motorcycle in it the
kill counter updated as zero kills we
rubber-banded in and out of the garage
for a moment and then it ticked over to
one kill although less significant
because it's pre combat we also
experienced rubber banding when
approaching the picnic tables in the
pre-loaded match area of the game it
seemed to become more of an issue as
players joined of course and similarly
in our full 12 minute recording pass for
one of the tests we also noticed the
fluctuating player count impacted even
the ground texture resolution with the
ground textures higher LOD unloading at
one point there are all kinds of other
examples and oddities like this split
second for example where the wall
disappears in one of the houses which
happens again a second later then
there's moments before when the shadows
were drawing in correctly while
parachuting down and just generally
graphics and visual issues that are
either inconsistent with reality or just
poor performance overall before starting
with some of the on-screen graphics we
have a new data presentation method to
show you what's happening with an Xbox
in terms of framerate so what's going to
happen is on the left of the screen we
will have a series of red and green bars
we'll also have ones and zeros so it's a
binary is this a new frame is it not a
new frame and then next to that we have
the frame count the number of frames as
the benchmark progresses so every time
you see a red bar what that means is
that we have dropped a frame we can
determine this by checking whether the
pixels constitute a new frame or if
there is no Delta between pixels which
would demonstrate a repeated frame so
when you see a lot of red in a row that
means we are stuttering we're replaying
the most recent unique new frame over
and over all the way through the red
until we can finally get enough system
resources to render a new frame
represented by green and if any of this
confuses you just check the article
below we'll try and explain it in more
detail there getting into the
performance discussion you can again
find our testing overview in the article
linked below but let's start out with a
pre-match frame time chart just because
it's a bit extreme it's one of the
cases so for this frame time chart
performance is disproportionately bad
for the first few minutes of every match
which is illustrated here as a reminder
we're looking at frame times versus time
and at 30fps that means our target frame
time should be 33 point 3 milliseconds
in other words the frame to frame render
interval to create a new frame is about
33 milliseconds the clip starts around
33 0.3 milliseconds as expected or 30fps
but has frequent spikes up to 100
milliseconds and 133 millisecond frame
times that means in the worst case
you're waiting a full 133 milliseconds
for the next unique frame to appear in
other words you're staring at a redrawn
version of the same frame for 1/10 of a
second while waiting for the next one
that's a long time later in the chart we
encounter frame times that equate a
rough 26 to 27 FPS average never quite
30 shown by the rapid bouncing up and
down of the frame time plot as it's
between our measurement resolution and
the actual intervals and here's some
pre-match footage if there's any place
in the game that should really overwhelm
the xbox it is the pre-match
free-for-all where 100 players are
scrambling to fire as many weapons as
possible in close proximity assets load
in here players all leap around and jump
on mass and then explosions go off
everywhere every time a Molotov explodes
the frame rate tanks with a good
fireball in view the frame rate can dip
as low as 12 FPS and seen an explosion
during gameplay generally means that an
enemy is within throwing distance which
is exactly the wrong time for perforins
to drop to 12 again 12 FPS watching
smoke grenades go off in real combat had
barely any impact whatsoever which means
that this scene is more like a Molotov
specific issue for whatever's happening
when that fire is being drawn you'd have
to find one outside of the pre-match and
throw it to see the effect in real
gameplay of course but after a countdown
everyone is abruptly teleported out of
the pre-match area and into a
featureless brown tube which slowly
resolves into a plane for gameplay
performance doesn't matter until boots
hit the ground but it's still hard to
accept the amount of time it takes to
load trees houses and even the plane
that's right in front of you as you dive
towards the ground at 209 km/h in our
first skydiving run
in a frame time plot here frame rate
drops to around 15 fps between parachute
deployment and hitting the ground that
was also just about enough time for the
parachutes texture to fully load right
before it unloads and is never seen
again the first couple minutes after
landing are the most dangerous our
average frame rate stayed around 25 fps
in this time frame and that potentially
makes parachuting into popular areas for
competing resources more difficult after
that frame rates generally stayed around
30 FPS if we stayed in one place or
walked but dropped if we drove too
quickly and entered new areas on a
vehicle this also happened if we smashed
fences as seen previously part of this
is resource loading and unloading from
adjacent cells as parts of the
environment are dropped in and out of
the players viewport but that might not
seem too bad but again most console
games do their utmost to never drop
below their framerate goal for even a
fraction of a second especially when
that goal is only 30 FPS this frame time
chart shows the FPS averaging out to 26
to 27 or in actual gameplay which is
certainly subpar and sometimes jarring
overall and then we do have occasional
spikes a fixed frame rate is the whole
point of a console here and we're losing
that in pop G surprisingly one on one
shooting punching and firefights had
little impact on performance compared to
the dips seen while driving a vehicle
LOD distance is obnoxiously low on
foliage and trees and there's clearly a
visible line of grass that advances
before the player network problems in
general Genki nests were far more
pressing problems than frames per second
during our time with the game on more
than one occasion it was possible to
walk straight up to an enemy punched
them and they were either frozen
helpless by lag or incapable of shooting
that closed right interesting control it
really didn't seem to matter well I can
do this rubber banding happened multiple
times on our highest-scoring run where
we really weren't trying we only
encountered two other players both of
whom chose to just drive away from us
rather than deal with a fight eventually
we hit a rock at 90 miles per hour and
ran ourselves over with our own
motorcycle but that can't really be
planes on the game watching this death
however frame by frame shows our
character hitting the rock flipping
upside down teleporting back towards the
rock and a standing pose without
bike and then equipping his gun sliding
back towards the river again and a
roughly dying the camera then pans up to
an invisible hill and plummets again as
the ragdoll falls through the bottom of
the river on this note we've observed
several general collision issues and
ragdoll physics defects when people die
in the game and just to make sure this
wasn't some issue with the Xbox one axe
trying to run at 4k we also manually
force 1080p through the Xbox settings in
this instance we ended up with the frame
time plot as seen on screen now and
frame rates still dropped below 30 fps
in the early parts of the game we made
do more precise comparisons in the
future if we do a PC benchmark with this
but for now we can say that running at
1080p definitely doesn't solve the
problems we've described on the Xbox one
X in its current state pub G on the Xbox
one X is technically playable you can
play it it's not really that enjoyable
of an experience though there's a lot of
ground here for the developers to
improve things and it's hard to build an
argument for the Xbox version versus the
PC version especially with the issues
the PC versions about one version number
ahead at least at 1.0 plus now so that's
a bit of a difference
the only real upside is that on the Xbox
you don't really encounter hackers which
is somewhat of a rampant problem on PC
but none of those things really matter
because if we're looking at performance
of the Xbox the big thing to take away
here in the current version of the game
is that other than all the kind of weird
visual oddities texture pop-in meshes
things like that collision there is
objectively an inconsistent framerate
that can make it hard to play at times
or in the very least unenjoyable to a
point of in worst cases hitting as low
as 12 fps that's pretty damn bad and
it's not just 12 FPS either because the
idea of FPS or frames per second is is
almost sort of silly because it
inherently is an average as a metric
frames per second but what's really
happening when we say 12 FPS it doesn't
mean you're just getting 12 frames per
second it means that after you calculate
out the huge frame time spikes it
happens to mathematically come out to 12
but you're not getting the updates in an
that as a player would actually be any
measure of fluid because when we're
talking about a frame time spike 133
milliseconds dragging our average down
to 12 fps after it's calculated which is
just a function of a thousand divided by
the frame time basically you're talking
about that ultimately what's happening
is you're playing the game and at some
point during play you hit something that
causes the same frame to be redrawn at
every interval for the next 1/10 of a
second or slightly more and that is
absolutely noticeable but some people
call it stutter or hitching or things
like that the point is you're seeing the
frame for a tenth of a second which is a
long time so yeah that's a that's Pope G
on the Xbox it's all the problems with
pub G on the PC when it was pretty one
point no I think it saw some problems
but not as bad compounded with being an
Xbox so it was definitely fun to test
though and it was worth improving our
Xbox testing tools because of the
problems well look at the PC version
