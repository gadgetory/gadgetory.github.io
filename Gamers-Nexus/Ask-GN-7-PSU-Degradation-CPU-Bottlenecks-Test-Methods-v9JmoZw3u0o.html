dotnet and we're back for another ask GN
episode lots of good questions this week
they get better every week and i really
do mean that they're getting very good
and it helps me call with new article
ideas talk about some things that maybe
I've thought about but haven't really
written or done a video about so please
keep it up if I missed your question
sorry we you know we can only fit so
many in a video without it being
ridiculous so just post it again and
I'll try and get to it or tweet at us at
gamers nexus for the next video so let's
get to the first one the first one is
from mark mark has a pretty good amount
of text here but the gist of the
question is how do I know how many lanes
talking about PCI Express Lanes my
current processor has how does it
allocate those lanes which would be
referring to probably the chipset
chipsets allocate lanes HSI o lanes
differently then purely pcie a lot of
the time excuse me and then he also says
how many ladies motherboard has chipset
and is basically asking how do you know
what do you do with pcie lanes how do
you figure out what you need so here's
the thing we've talked about this a few
times now it's been a recurring topic in
the episodes and hopefully at this point
things are starting to make a bit of
sense pcie lanes come in a few forms but
ultimately it's just a pcie lane it's a
form of communication through which some
device the cpu chipset communicates with
a device in a pci express slot which is
an interface it was what we call those
and those interfaces have bandwidth
limitations they have standards they
have pin counts all this stuff and that
creates the PCIe laying the PCIe device
pcie slot all that so when it comes to
PCI Elaine's first of all to know how
many your processor has the best thing
to do if it's not on our website or
something just go to google and type in
the name of the architecture for the
processor or the chipset often will work
as well followed by block diagram so if
you go to google and you type in z 170
block diagram that diagram which
I've shown in a previous video several
times now should include two thins it'll
have the CPU normally at the top and
then the chipset at the bottom which is
Z 170 so even though you're looking for
the chipsets block diagram it should
include the current generation or
generation appropriate CPU diagram in
there as well which will tell you how
many pcie lanes the CPU has those lanes
from the cpu are generally what's
allocated to your graphics processing
devices the CPU unlike the chipset just
has access to maybe 20 maybe 24 maybe 40
in the case of the ex 99 2011 CPUs some
amount of lanes it takes those it gives
it to the high powered devices and then
the chipset does the rest so in the case
of the Z 170 chipset you have 26 HSI oh
lanes those can be allocated to various
things they can be allocated to SATA two
gigabit ethernet but they can also be
allocated 20 of them are already
allocated to pcie however as we've
discussed a few times out the chipset
lanes are used for i/o so if you have 20
pcie lanes from the chipset and they're
in groups of four or five groups of four
you're generally going to be using those
not for graphics which you really would
want x8 if you're doing SLI but you'd be
using those for storage so m dot too for
example a lot of people maybe don't know
this i'm about to is a PCIe device even
though it's called m dot to it will use
pcie lanes and the thing to note here is
well how many lanes doesn't end out to
device use and generally the safe
assumption is four lanes but some lime a
bit slower or older and they will use
two lanes you can assign them more not
not that you assign them but the chipset
can assign them more but it doesn't mean
it'll go faster and this is true for
basically any device on any interface
just like SATA drives back in the day
before SSDs were really a thing if you
had a say too hard drive it really
didn't matter if you have
on SATA 2 or say 23 because it was
generally other than maybe some bursted
increments it was generally not the
interface that throttled you but the
device that's true here as well so that
stated generally the items to look for
would be look up the block diagram for
the chipset or the CPU that tells you
how many lanes are available figure out
what your building is it multi-gpu is it
more than two GPUs if it is you need to
be very careful in your processor
selection to make sure that that
processor will support an adequate Lane
configuration this is different topic
for another video maybe but generally
just keep it around by eight that's a
pretty safe range us to buy 8 by 16
thing yes there is a difference it's
very small and the performance gain from
just having another GPU is going to sort
of make that difference irrelevant but
the next thing to look at other than
GPUs is actually SSDs if you have pcie
ssds or if you have nvme SSDs or if you
have m.2 ssds those all use PCIe lanes
so you need to make sure those are
available through the chipset or
somewhere else if not I hope that helps
the question was it left a lot to to my
interpretation here so if that wasn't a
good enough answer then just clarify
below and I'll try and address the next
week because it's a pretty fun topic and
I think we people people probably don't
hear about a lot easy over dose asks a
big question asking about CPU
limitations for benchmarking and it is a
it's a pretty big question so the gist
of easy overdoses concerns where why
don't reviewers post benchmarks using
custom settings for games and why don't
reviewers try to use higher end or lower
end cpu is appropriate to whatever
graphics out there testing so this comes
down to methodology and specifically
talking to the question of custom
settings will do a lot of that if you
look at our Witcher 3 and GTA graphics
guides I sit there i go through every
single setting I test all of the
benchmark performance
FPS I'll figure out okay what's the best
setting to use how can you get an extra
5 FPS out of GTX 970 or r9 380 or
whatever how do I get an extra 5 FPS out
of that without just tanking all the
settings down to high or medium from
whatever the other setting is so that's
something I do but in the benchmarks
like with battlefront yes i'm using a
preset and there's a few reasons for
this and other reviewers will likely
agree on at least one of these but the
reason most reviewers stick with the
presets for settings is about two two
main reasons one is usability a lot of
gamers will try to just choose a preset
because they don't understand the
options or don't care to understand the
options so in that regard it's easier to
present the data to someone who is les
savy now it's also easier to search for
the data on Google if you're looking for
just an ultra bench it's easier to find
that said the bigger reason that a lot
of reviewers myself included will use
the preset is because we want to
eliminate the possibility for test
errors so this is a testing methodology
question which is something that I
actually specialized in before and all
throughout the creation and existence of
gamers Nexus so test methodology was my
field and with test methodology your
objective is to eliminate the chance for
tester or technician error during the
execution of a test especially when
we're time limited like we often are
with games and video cards and one of
the best ways to do that is to not screw
with anything that you don't have to
change so you want to use presets
because maybe maybe I have Patrick stone
one of our editors maybe I have him come
in and run for tests on video cards for
battle from for me in that scenario I
need to be able to tell him just set it
to ultra and set it too high and then
run the tests the minute I start
changing settings is a chance for him to
miss that setting or a chance for me to
screw up as the night drones on and
missed the setting so it's a testing
methodology issue where you don't want
to inadvertently introduced test error
and generally at least at our website we
will always catch test error
when it comes to settings if there is
any but maybe some sites don't have the
the amount of eyes on a benchmark before
publishing it in that instance you
really don't want to don't want to mess
something up inadvertently because it'll
skew all the data and you won't find out
until it's published so that's why that
happens there's other reasons too but
one of the main ones battlefront for
instance we published the benchmark on
that I'm looking at the actual settings
do a graphics guide but because I did
the benchmark first and because that was
the thing that we wanted to do first for
strategic reasons we didn't go through
and dig through all the settings to see
what they all did before the benchmark
so it's best just leave it on presets I
hope that helps as far as CPU
limitations bench test benches are built
in a way that is specific to the
component of tested so we have one bench
for GPUs we have one set of components
for CPUs where the platform obviously
changes it was set up a bench for RAM
all this stuff so there are four or five
different computers that are in use on
or off for different testing purposes
and the reason for that is because you
want to isolate all of your environments
to make sure there's no contamination so
as you install test equipment on one
system software otherwise you don't want
that to influence for example i'm
installing so on the RAM system I don't
want it to influence my GPU system you
it's very important to make sure that
environments aren't contaminated make
sure they're the same every time make
sure they easily deployable because any
kind of change can mess up the data and
then you have to rerun all of it
potentially months of data so that's how
the the benches are built and then in
terms of CPU selection in GPU
benchmarking you generally want a CPU
that will make sure there's no
throttling of the GPU so if we're
throwing in an MSI seahawk into a bench
we probably want to use and did use an x
99 solution with eye on cpu to make sure
the CPU does not bottleneck the GPU
because if it does we're no longer
presenting an absolute performance Delta
between all the cards so that's sort of
the methodology behind it that goes way
deeper than that I'm happy to discuss it
quite obviously I've been caught on
now so if you guys do want to know more
about the methodology just let me know
I'll go more into it but I don't want to
take too long here one question so
moving on Samuel Clinton says my
question is not related to specs or any
items in specific but i think is
something everyone struggles with how to
minimize or even neutralize dust from
getting in the case so I actually really
like this question does it something
I've been dealing with myself lately
there's a couple ways to do it there's a
lot of voodoo magic online arcane BS
such a while but couple main ways to do
it with cooling a system you have
various options liquid cooling air
cooling for the sort of primary to
everyone's familiar with but there's
also things like the stack effect the
stack effect is when you create a system
in which the air intake is normally on
the bottom and the silverstone raven 02
would be an example this it takes on the
bottom there's no one take anywhere else
only exhaust on top and so you're
creating a smoke stack where the air
comes in under the case there is going
to be cooler towards the ground by the
way and that gets pulled up and then
shot through the exhaust fan at the top
of the case now on this set up the
motherboard is rotated which is actually
very interesting it's a 90 degree
rotation so in that instance your
cooling the GPU more efficiently as well
this is the best performing case I've
ever tested so that uses the stack
effect it cool as a sideline to this
stack effect cool and often but not
always often helps with dust management
because you're forcing all the dust
through a single intake channel which
means it's easier to clean it so here's
the the main thing with dust you're
never going to build a system that's
just magically impenetrable to dust it's
always a good idea to clean once a month
ideally but if it goes longer that's
okay as long as you set it up properly
so there is no such thing as a system
which won't collect dust but you can
minimize it quite a bit and the main
ways to do it are to try and force the
dust through one area just to make your
life easier when you're cleaning so if
you have one kind of primary intake area
you can do it that way the other main
theta is positive and negative pressure
systems so if you bill
your system with a case where you
manually configure the case in such a
way that the air intake is is considered
positive where the in the air inside of
the case is a higher pressure than the
air outside that creates a suction
action where the air is moving one
direction or the other depending on if
it's positive or negative so if you set
it up the right way you can have sort of
an all-in taker all exhaust system
that's sort of the easiest top level way
to do it but there are cooling issues
there you can potentially create
vortexes ideally you sort of set up a
mix of positive and negative where you
just have maybe one or two intake fans
you position them somewhere easy to
access with the dust cover like most
cases now have some kind of dust
filtration set up and then the rest is
exhaust and the reason that works if you
think about it is because if you have
exhaust you have air blowing out of the
top of the case dust shouldn't be
collecting there because there's air
coming out of it it should push the dust
away right so that will help a lot just
kind of do a couple intake fans in one
spot and then liquid helps as well not a
whole lot because what happens hand as
the dust just gets all shoved into the
radiator if you don't clean it off in so
that is a concern but liquid can help
especially do open loop because you can
limit the amount of fans you need and
then you just set it all up to be
exhaust really except for maybe one fan
if you if you want to make sure there's
some intake of course but you can set up
more exhaust that wait in line with the
dust so moving on next question Derek L
love this channel thank you that that
means a lot definitely is a reason that
we produce all this content work so hard
love this channel my question is about
psu degradation if my current setup is
using a nineteen ninety percent of my
500 watt psu should i replace it sooner
rather than later EVGA recommends a
minimum of 500 watts so you're right on
the right on the middle I've talked
about this a bit but not it not this
specific question so first of all the
power supplies are happiest when you're
using them depending on the the supplier
the manufacturer
they're happiest when you use them
somewhere in the sixty to eighty percent
of power utilization range that's when
they're the most efficient so a very
easy example take a 100 watt power
supply depending on the manufacturer it
will be happiest if you're using 60
watts of power maybe 80 watts of power
leaving some overhead for heat and
efficiency loss and degradation as we're
just discussing here so degradation is a
real thing with power supplies they do
actually lose some of their ability to
retain that advertised wattage over time
they lose some of the charge and that's
from things like capacitor aging and
other electrical components aging but
especially capacitors and especially in
lower end power supplies where they're
maybe not rated for as many hours like
the solid or Japanese capacitors and
that's because they start leaking the
week power that happen is just from heat
from age it makes them less able to
retain all the power that they used to
so in that case you you do actually face
the the question of well when will my
power supply died as long as you leave
that overhead in there that rule of
thumb sixty to eighty percent
utilization you'll probably be okay if
you're on 500 watts and they're
recommending 500 watts for whatever your
setup is then you're pretty up against
the limit there but just looking at the
specs provided to me by Derek Derek
Scott at 46 90 k at a 970 I'm not sure
how much power that that exact 970 draws
but the 46 90 k with a 970 should
probably not be really much above 300
watts if it is about 300 watts and that
k is written we're in pretty good shape
because you're not they recommend 500
but you're not going to be heading 500
probably with that setup unless you have
some crazy amount of fans or other stuff
going on that I don't know about I hope
that helps moving on you to be 24 hello
Steve great show as always thank you my
question is is it true that you need at
least a minimum of 24 to 32 gigabytes of
memory system memory to fully take
advantage of
12 gigabytes of vram on Titan X thanks
in advance so this is an interesting
question I'm if you could let me know
where you read that that would be really
helpful I'm not too active in the
workstation communities so maybe maybe
was there but it depends on what you're
doing if you're gaming you're not going
to use them at that vram anyway but the
system memory will not be limiting you
in game Ian what they might be talking
about some sort of virtual memory type
thing or maybe they're talking about the
workstation application where the
workstation will just bottleneck if you
don't have that amount of system ram
because for example adobe premiere adobe
premiere eats all the system ram that
you throw at it we have 32 gigabytes in
one of our round two rigs 64 and another
all of that Ram gets used when we're
rendering videos of post-processing
effects the video does not come out
looking like this from the camera we
have to do color correction audio
correction stuff like that that takes
memory and if we put 12 gigabytes of
memory in the system then yes using a
tight necks with 12 gigabytes it will
probably be throttled by the limited
system ram but not because adobe can't
use or access the video ram on the titan
exits it's more because it's choking on
the system ram limitation if it wants
more of that before it wants more the
via gram so that's one very specific
example where I think I understand the
question but other than that please let
me know specifically what you're talking
about and I'll get back to it so hugs a
lot was the last real question hugs lot
says I asked the slack last week skylake
isn't ideal for two-way SLI crossfire
due to its twenty lane pcie limitations
right so forcing two cards at a texts
and significant loss on performance but
then again if you can't measure the
difference on skype anyway is it at all
possible for pcie video card to use by
16 off the cpu and then pcie another
pcie card by 16 off the CEO and sony
chipset so the answer to that is no
these e170 chipset supplies its twenty
pcie lanes
groups of four as I've said two groups
of four which means five sets of 4 20
and because they're in groups of four
you can't mix and match them it doesn't
work that way they are more meant for
i/o throughput stuff like that with my
two devices or Wi-Fi cards or gigabit
ethernet stuff like that for the HSI oh
lanes so no you can't just mix and match
the lanes like that for sli that said
using two by eight cards currently I'm
it might change the future but currently
you're not losing a lot of performance
by going to buy it from by 16 yes it is
half of the potential throughput on the
interface but as I said in the beginning
of this video the interface is normally
not a limiter to the device itself so
the PCIe interface is starting to get
that way where it's there's potential to
limit the newer high end video cards but
generally right now at the launch of
this video if you have pcie 3.0 by 8 and
you have some modern video card a 980 TI
you're not going to be losing a lot of
performance it will not be significant
compared to the performance gain from
just having two GPUs and by eight so I
would not worry about that too much
final thing here the count from dark
drifter his head did you shave no and a
frowny crying face so there sometimes
videos where it might look like this
goes unmodified for a while fun fact
that normally is a way for you to tell
if I've been up for 20 hours trying to
produce content so like the the
battlefront stuff the star citizen stuff
that just came out recently both of
those things are very very
time-intensive and not friendly with
sleep in those instances there might be
some sacrifice of management of any kind
of hair or a shirt or anything as you'll
see in the videos like the star citizen
one I have like a white dot right here
something that I missed another video I
had like a hair hanging off my
shirt video so that's normally
indicative of how long I've been up
producing content but that is all for
this time thanks for watching guys
please leave more questions comments in
the video in this video I'll check this
one first and as always hit that patreon
link if you like this coverage anything
that helps as always big thanks to those
of you who have backed us but I do want
to make clear again the best thing you
can do is is just watch subscribe
hopefully learn something that's the
goal of the channel and tell people
about it posted on social media or
whatever because that's that's really
the biggest way to spread the word about
the channel and help us grow it patreon
is great but I don't need direct money I
really just want the content to get out
there because I feel like working with
the audience with you guys we're
starting to produce some really cool
stuff and it's more time intensive but
it's also really rewarding to do so help
me share it and thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
