is our maybe almost third day now we're
here the gigabytes suite but this is the
bricks VR this is a new gigabyte
complete system pretty small it has a
GTX 1060 in it and in AI 770 700 K let
that be kV Lee where you be taking this
part the inside is pretty cool the
thermal solution I think is definitely
understand I haven't tested it but it's
pretty unique so we'll take that apart
before you get into that this content is
brought to you by cyber power and their
cyber gaming XL system which has an
invertible motherboard layout and you
can learn more and be linked in the
description below so for the outside
pretty small shell all of our i/o is lit
your videos out I oh and then there's
your USB and audio and things like that
flipping it over this is the bottom side
and it's just got four screws in the
bottom so that's pretty trivial to do of
course it all for those undone and then
once we open it it actually unfold in a
way that reveals the CPU and GPU
separately and with the custom cooling
solution okay so that's removed four
screws and it's got some clips TV inside
now there's a cooling fan just one fan
for the whole unit and again it's at the
bottom the intake is coming in through
these sort of chamfered edges around the
base plate that the screws connect to
and that it sits on you got your intake
there I'm not sure the size that's found
which would maybe be a 92 or 100
millimeter or something like that ok so
the next part this flies apart like that
so we've only taken out four screws so
far and there's the rest of the shell
what's the video out from the GPU so
this size then internally there's some
couple loose cables because of CES and
some taking apart a few times internally
there's the GPU pulling solution of key
people in solution this one is for the
CPU and the other side which has the
video out ports to make it obvious is
the GPU coin solution so flipping it
over we've got two screws here
one near the cooling fan and then one is
deeper in the cave once you get those
two screws out this just completely
separates pulls open like this and
there's your power cable but once it
separates you can see the heatsink
solution aluminum sends there's a single
copper heat pipe and I believe a copper
base plate but we'll look when we take
it apart and this is the GPU cooling
solution and the CPU one we'll look at
in a moment but just for a preview
there's a CPU cooling solution both of
them you can see how pretty this one has
larger fins but the GPU solution is a
little different in that to get some
extra surface area the fins have
somewhat of a bezel outward and
hopefully that picks up on camera but
and this is on all them so it
deliberates through all the fins back
and that gives a bit more surface area
to dissipate the heat there's a single
screw dead centered down the middle so
if we wanted to take the heatsink off
its the GPU that's where we start and
then there's a ton of thermal pads
underneath us from what I've been told -
in theory that helped with the heat
buildup in such a small unit because
again you're relying on a single fan to
cool this whole thing and our exhaust is
exhaust is exactly the same as the
intakes so for the exhaust you've got
just a small chamfered edge where
they're escape so that means there's a
lot of Keats's dissipate in small space
that have the presses no more there's
actually a bunch of thermocouples
chopped off in here from their R&amp;amp;D team
definitely been through some testing
let's let's pull this
PTU portion out and then maybe look at
the heatsink and more depth I basically
took out an m2 as a C or maybe it's
dummy one I'm not sure that's even a
realist it is real I see we got an m2
SSD and that uncovered the wireless card
then we just connected the antennas and
now this should slide out they go
someplace to take that power header
there's the shell nothing too special
once it's all fair like that the bat
aside and here is the memory obviously
MDOT to port your wireless card a couple
of inductors and then the i/o MMD as
other I think led to the CPU heatsink at
this point and it's got bricks branded
chokes all around it with a couple
MOSFETs as you would expect so that's
the basics of the cooler I'm curious
about one thing I want to take this one
off because it is a CPU cooler if you
get a bit warm see how complex is too
cool okay there we go so it's actually
still got thermal paste on it this is
the underside we've got a copper cold
plate it is actually protruded which as
we've shown in some of our testing is
normally a good seen sort of conclusion
the copper cold player actually looks
like might even just be a solder layer
between that and the heat pipe I was
wrong about the heat pipes there are
actually two of them so there's one heat
pipe on the perimeter here and that is
going over the vram if you kind of lay
them out next to each other that heat
pipe is contacting vram and it's
contacting either the capacitor bank
over here or the chokes for the vrm and
then the inner heat pipe is
and our key type is Wisconsin is helping
with the GPU cooling and it looks like
the other part of the BRM that's the
cooling solution from the underside
fairly substantial given the small form
factor a lot of thermal pads as
advertised
and there's actually maybe you can get
in a get a zoom in on this one
potentially there's actually an aluminum
plate that's again it looks like
soldered to the rest of the aluminum
plate and then the thermal pad on top of
it and that is in fact what is
contacting the capacitor bank from the
looks of it and then you've got a couple
of others for outlier sets and then some
giant clay paste the internal pads for
contact with the vram actually so that's
the vrm cooling right there v RM or V
Graham rather using C Ram and then a GPU
capacitor bank and show so that's the
entire cooling solution for the small
form-factor system we just took apart
