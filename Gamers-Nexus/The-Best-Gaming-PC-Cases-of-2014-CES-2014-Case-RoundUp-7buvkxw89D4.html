Nexus dotnet and today we're doing a
case roundup for 2014 this includes all
of the cases for the most part that I
saw at CES 2014 so we're highlighting
some of the best of the best here
I did see about 30 cases and this one
we're gonna start with the mid-range
gaming enclosures so this will be cases
in the 100 to 160 170 dollar range stuff
that we technically 150-plus you're
entering enthusiasts but we're gonna
call it mid-range so first of all we're
starting off with the NZXT h4 40 case
this is the one I'm not afraid to call
an innovator in some ways I mean they
remove the optical drive base so sure
other cases have certainly done that but
in this market it's generally not seen
too much for gaming enclosures so NZ FC
has removed the optical drive base
they've also added a power supply shroud
covering the power supply and all the
cabling which is awesome that's
something that's generally modded in buy
case modders they added in stock so
that's pretty cool it's it's not
something you have to pay extra for
anything that's just included this is a
120 dollar case it ships with three 120
millimeter front fans and can support
obviously a 360 millimeter radiator in
the front if you remove those fans and
additionally the top will support a
three sixty millimeter radiator if for
some reason you wanted to or if you just
want it at the top and and then the rear
supports a standard 140 millimeter fan
and that's about it there are no bottom
fans because the PSU shroud covers
everything and there are no drive
scaffolding mounted fans so that is the
h4 40 it's very cool-looking it's it
ships in black red and white black so
basically on this case you're seeing
right now replace all the white with
black and all the black with red and
that's the other option and here's a
photo of it so that's the h4 40 let's
move on to the next the next mid-range
case here this is a $160 case is $40
more than the h4 40 and it's the
Thermaltake corvy 71 so the corvy 71 I
thought was pretty neat when I saw it in
their suite at CES 2014 it weighs in
slightly above the h4 40 in terms of
size on price that said it does have a
bit more cooling support if you want a
420 mm meter rate
for what reason if you're building
something insane go for it this is the
case supports for 20 millimeter
radiators on the top and the front and
supports just about every other radiator
size in the bottom the back you name it
in terms of cool features you can
actually mount a harddrive vertically on
the rear side of the case the right side
so if you want to mount something
vertically and get easier access for
cabling you can do that and finally it
does come with a pretty large side panel
window this is different from the t-80
one which we'll get to in a second the
the side panel on the V 71 is just a
standard side panel it's one window one
panel no no quote unquote suicide doors
that you'll see on the T 81 it is mesh
across little case to the front the top
that's all mesh and then the sides are
standard steel and now we're moving into
the enthusiast market this is for cases
that are in the 180 plus sort of
spectrum and we're starting with
Corsairs graphite 760 T it is a full
tower case I was in love with this case
when I saw it at CES just because of the
massive side window it's it's pretty
neat it's it actually hinges outward so
the side window gives you good
visibility inside of course I had this
one they had on display actually has the
fourth video card is bent so don't do
that at home it will be very bad for
your motherboard but that was a display
system so I imagine it was a shipping
issue the 760 t in terms of fans ships
stock with three 140 millimeter fans
those are the AF 140 ELLs it also has an
included fan controller that can switch
between high and low that's 12 volts and
7 volts so you can run the fans at about
half speed maybe 60% speed aftermarket
air cooling you can include 3 140
millimeter fans in the top to 140 s in
the front and 1 144 rear exhaust and
then finally a 120 millimeter bottom
mounted fan if you want that for your
video card cooling so the biggest thing
here is just really it's just the window
the window is the coolest thing overall
pretty easy to cable manage from what
we've seen and very good-looking with
the side panel so moving on to wheeler
master is 1/2 XC doesn't yet have a
price and it's actually in flux this
case might not make it to market in its
current form so do like Coolermaster
know if you'd like to see it this one is
special because it's kind of like
Corsairs carbide air 540 that's the the
double wide case as i call it it is like
a double wide tray
in both the air 540 and the half XE that
we're talking about now you install the
power supply and the drives and some of
the other non-essential will call them
board components in the right half of
the case they're completely obscured to
the user and then you install the board
and everything else as standard in the
left half of the case and on the half XE
the left half has a full side panel
window so just like the the case I just
spoke about it covers the entire side
panel so you can see everything in there
and it actually bends around angles
around the corners which is pretty neat
so that that can give you some pretty
awesome options for lighting and cascade
lighting effects if you do any modding
moving on to the thermal take ta t1 this
is our next enthusiast class case this
one is priced at 180 ish dollars
Thermaltake sort of described it as a
900 d that fits under your desk so
instead of being your desk it fits under
your desk which is probably a good thing
because the 900 d is pretty freakin big
so we saw that last year the TA t1 as
part of thermal takes urban family of
cases and it's similar to the v71 except
it has a hinging quote unquote suicide
door left panel you can actually use a
key to open the side panel and then
there's a black steel body that covers
the drive scaffolding that opens
separately from the glass panel that
covers the motherboard and the rest of
the core components other than that it
does ship with the same full radiator
support if it's about every radiator you
can possibly think of and just like the
V 71 it's the 420 millimeters you know
360 whatever everything so same specs
just a little different side panel and a
little bit more expensive and it
includes three two hundred millimeter
fans installed stock with removable dust
filters and that's pretty much it for
this one it does again have modular
cages moving on to the antique 1900 this
is our final in the enthusiast lineup it
is a two hundred five dollar case
technically I think MSRP is like 270 but
it's everywhere for 205 so that's what
it is as far as I'm concerned I've
actually I saw it for 170 which was an
insane deal on Newegg definitely keep an
eye out for that in the future again the
900 d had a huge target on its back this
year and tech and coolermaster were both
gunning for it so it was thermaltake and
even Corsair is kind of competing with
themselves in a way but no one quite
touches it in terms of size the 1900 is
a little bit skinnier than the 900
it's a little bit shorter but it offers
almost the same internal specs so it
fits I think 17 total drives that's
including the 5.25 drives so it will fit
12 3.5 s and 2 2.5 s natively and then
three five and a quarter drives it has
nine expansion slots so it's a pretty
damn big case and stock it ships with
all fluid dynamic bearing fans these are
real FDB fans not the fake ones that
we've seen with other cases and they are
in order three 120-millimeter front
FTB's two 120-millimeter top and one 120
millimeter rear pre-installed fan so
that's everything for the 1900
definitely worth looking into I was
pretty excited about the price for the
amount of features we get moving on
finally to the last two budget cases so
these are the ultra budget cases for
system builders the GX 900 is the first
one I don't have a price on this yet I
have a very good indication that is
going to be a sub 70 price point but we
will see it's similar to the GX 700 that
I reviewed recently the the body the
chassis are a little bit different but
in terms of target market it is very
similar to the GX 700 it ships with
support for 170 millimeter CPU coolers
in height so that's pretty good that
covers just about everything including
the argon AR 0 1 and a 3 10 millimeter
video card so again just about every
video card on the market except for
maybe some really crazy ones cable
management wasn't a huge feature with
this case as with all the other ones
we've discussed but it does have enough
room you can fit pretty much a whole
hand back there so as far as we're
concerned you'll be able to manage it
easily enough and it might take some
more fighting than the other cases but
definitely a possibility to manage all
your cables so nothing too special here
I want to give a quick shout to the P
100 because it's also a very good case
the front panels a little too flimsy for
my taste hopefully they'll fix that but
it is a 100 dollar case if you want
something slightly more expensive also
from an tech and finally Coolermaster
silencio 452 is a $95 case it is a
silent themed case so it uses 800 rpm
fans which are they're a little bit
slower but much quieter I think they
advertise 15 DBA I'm not sure how they
test that but that's what they advertise
it doesn't use mesh paneling for the
fans instead it uses slits on the side
of the case similar to the aged six
thirty by NZXT and what that means is
the noise is directed away from the user
toward the back or the side of the case
so the user isn't hearing as much of the
fan noise the the case itself has a more
discrete look it's all pretty flat matte
colored and and not too gamer themed
quote-unquote this case does support
slightly smaller CPU coolers so keep
that in mind you're gonna eliminate a
few since it's only 158 millimeters in
height hit the link in the description
below for the full article coverage and
quick shoutout if you don't like these
budget options check out the Roseville
stealth that's in a video it should be
on the sidebar my Rosewill CES coverage
that's a bit cheaper and yeah as always
thanks for watching we will see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
