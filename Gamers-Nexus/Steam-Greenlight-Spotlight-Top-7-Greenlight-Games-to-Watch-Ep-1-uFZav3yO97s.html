nexus donna and this is our first video
in a series of videos that will look at
the top steam greenlight games to watch
these are games that need your approval
on Steam to be available on Steam so
definitely watch these and then go vote
for the ones that you like first we have
guzzi earth adventure which draws on the
days of Raymond and it's classic 2d
platforming style you play as oozy an
alien who crash-landed on earth and it
is your goal to fight back to his
spacesuit and return home the game
boasts five hours of story mode 20
levels and 4 boss fights and it is
beautifully drawn if I say so myself the
art is fantastic and has an overall
fitting aesthetic and theme so go vote
for Susie if you like this style of
platformer in the old school mode that
it is exoplanet is our second game
exoplanet first contact doesn't have too
much gameplay information on it yet but
we do know that it is a space western
much in the spirit of Firefly which
casts our hero into an open action RPG
in a visually stunning world the RPG
itself is very flexible and doesn't
confine us to statistics so it is up to
the player to traverse this world and
free yourself from your captors positron
is the next game if the word light cycle
means anything to you at all you may be
familiar with tron's light-based racing
motorcycles positron seems to draw
inspiration from Tron and creates
maze-like digital driven worlds where
you're forced to race against other
riders and basically your goal is to
leave a light trail behind you that in a
creative way you trick the other rider
into crashing into the skilling them it
is also a maze based games so it's
pretty cool-looking and a very fast
paced next we have a knight washer and
it is a rather unique game I suppose you
play as a washing machine and not just
any washing machine though you are a
Knightly one with a lense and with your
trusty Lance you bounce around from
place to place and joust other
appliances and
is and the first were heard of night
washes trailer actually is rather
fitting it's simply huh and that's about
the feel of the game it's a comedic
action RPG that throws our brave washing
machine into a medieval world forced is
one of our last three games in a classic
arena styled cooperative combat forced
allows up to four players to work
together in tactical battles and your
goal is to simply kill all the bad
things before they kill you the game
heavily focuses on action team play and
it uses a mark combo system similar to
do the fourth editions actually to
encourage cooperative play unepic is our
second choice of game to follow for this
week and this parody RPG our hero is
interrupted in a game of D&amp;amp;D when he
desperately needs to go to the bathroom
and that's when things go wrong the
lights flicker and he finds himself
transported into an actual castle much
like the one who is fighting through in
D&amp;amp;D except lacking the mountain dew and
doritos and this self-deprecating RPG
you can platform your way through levels
craft items and spec out your character
in true action platformer RPG style and
finally bleed you may have heard of
bleed from the Microsoft dream build
play contest it has gotten quite a bit
of attention actually you play as a
pink-haired rebel in this twitch
platformer and it is if I say so myself
very similar to contra in both
difficulty and style you work your way
through multiple levels and your
characters goal is to become the
ultimate video game hero fittingly
enough lead as an action focused
platformer with mechanical fluidity and
play and if you want as you watch this
video you'll see that everything seems
to flow together really well with the
mechanics so I highly encourage
endorsing this one on Steam greenlight
that's all the games we have for you
this week check back next week on Friday
for the next seven videos in this series</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
