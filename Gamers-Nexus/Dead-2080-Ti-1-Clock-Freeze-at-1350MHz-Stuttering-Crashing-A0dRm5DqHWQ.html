atti failure it's not a BSOD on this one
we already talked about that the B SATs
are largely caused by I mean there's a
reason they're multiple monitors here
largely caused by monitors of high
refresh with g-sync or just sometimes
random monitors this one however is an
issue because it times by and actually
every game every 3d application they're
all running really slowly and if you
look at the frequency that's because the
clock is stuck at 1350 megahertz so
we're gonna show you how this particular
bug on the 28 et eyes works today before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below this particular card with the 13
50 megahertz lock it's not ever boosting
above 1350 and if we overclock it at all
like 10 megahertz it'll instantly
exhibit issues and I'll show you that in
a moment but the card is an EVGA 20 80
TI XC gaming it's not the ultra it's a 2
slot card it uses the reference PCB
that's the common thread between all
these so we have a bit of sample bias
because we're in the US and most of the
people who sent us cards are in the u.s.
eg has the dominant vendor here so most
the cards are either Nvidia Fe or EVGA
but all of them use the reference PCB
all the ones we've received that's why
we've got a stack of Fe cards we have
some EVGA cards some gigabyte cards and
we have more coming in but this one is
the only one that does this so let me
walk you through exactly how this works
we think it's almost certainly a V BIOS
bug we wanted to film this before
validating that because it's no going
back once we fix it so here's the issue
right now we're running times pi I've
got two monitors hooked up just cuz that
was a common multi monitor BSOD bug but
we're not experiencing that with this
one this card is getting away with it so
if we go to sensors you'll see GPU ZZZ
reporting a 1350 flat clock EVGA
precision 1350 flat and the temperature
if it can be trusted as shown as sixty
degrees on the GPU and we're also fairly
confident that the view
the memory is doing just fine as well so
this is some other issue and if you look
at the power target here the slider
can't move at all it is immovable and
this one can move but the power target
can't also the power target always says
zero so even if we unlink them it always
says zero so you can't go up this is
clearly some kind of bugged v bios or
almost certainly anyway and the fans
there's just more of a precision bug but
they seem to be showing zero rpm however
we have had issues where this cards fans
sometimes weren't spinning up at all
because the frequency is so low that
it's really not doing enough work to
generate any heat as evidenced by the
60-degree temperature and this is after
clean install this happened on the
customers card as well before I mean it
is the customers card on their system
before they sent it to us so what I'm
going to do is just 25 megahertz offset
this frequency should easily be at like
1900 megahertz so we're around 600
megahertz below where we should be on
the twenty atti
so we're just going to do a twenty five
offset and we'll get the camera pan up
to the top screen before I hit apply and
now I am going to hit apply and let's
see what happens
so far the other screen is frozen so
that's a good course yet we're getting
freezing on the bottom okay it's back
kind of okay so now it's freezing see
that stutter that just happened if we go
back down to the bottom screen we've got
a spinning Windows icon precision is
crashing and we're still seeing 1350
megahertz in both applications GPZ is
Allah is not responding either so both
those applications have crashed or in
the process of crashing and then now
we're getting a full system freeze and I
try to close that and we get a black
screen
okay so it didn't stay on the black
screen this time like it has in the past
but everything is still locked down and
frozen so this is just from trying to do
a 25 megahertz offset and sometimes
it'll actually kind of stick but it
stutters a lot so let's show that
behavior - okay so it's back open after
a reboot we're just gonna do ten
megahertz offset on the core now and
there it goes so there's there's the
example the other behavior where you can
see it's just stuttering for like half a
minute at a time at this point and it'll
eventually draw a frame but it's
skipping 99% of them so at this point
this is unrecoverable we can't restore
to defaults or provide any input we all
have to hard reset once again and now
it's time to probably flash the V bios
and see if that fixes it and here we've
gotten I didn't hit the reset button yet
so we've gotten just a straight black
screen okay restart so one last thing to
show you here before the flash this is
an XC ultra that passed successfully no
issues with that card 65 20 points on
that one and then on the card we've been
testing and on this card right fifty two
hundred points so clearly it's scoring
lower as well if you allow it to
actually complete that's because the
frequency is extremely low so let's
flash bios then and see that fixes this
update successful okay reboot well then
work so it's still stuck at the same
issues like the power target is zero we
can't increase it afterburner doesn't
know what to do with it either so that's
not working
the clocks should be the same as they
were I'll just illustrate that and so
we're left with an issue where it's
either an in silicon error or it's like
the BIOS chip error some kind of
hardware level defect is most likely to
cause you this is not a driver issue and
clearly it's not a V bios issue because
we took unknown good one and we flashed
it and that should fix it for sure if
it's a V BIOS corruption issue or
something like that so let's give this
one more chance though and see where it
boosts to yep 1350 megahertz so it's
still broken so this card this is card
b1 that's our label and we have labels
on all the cards so b1 is an EVGA 28 eti
XC gaming it seems to have a V bios
defect maybe it's not boosting the
clocks over 1350 power target can't be
changed
the fans act kind of screwy sometimes
and the scores are low they match the
frequency so this isn't just a reporting
bug in software the scores are actually
significantly lower which is important
to validate because otherwise it can
just be a software reporting bug which
is not what this is this is some kind of
probably hardware level defect and
there's nothing at this point I don't
know what I can do with it so we're
gonna take it apart probably take a look
at it see if there's anything really
clear and visible and otherwise oh no
well look at the next set of cards and
start seeing if we can draw some
conclusions what's happening to them we
have a lot these are Effy's need to look
at those four primarily artifacting
issues that you all have reported and
then we also have another EVGA card
we've got a gigabyte card so lots to go
through but anyway I guess all this
really shows you is that yes this is a
real problem it's not just people making
stuff up on reddit or something we were
able to validate this one we're able to
validate the VSO DS and where you see
whatever what other kinds of weird
errors we can find on the twenty series
I guess it seems like there are quite a
few though so this is an instance where
at this point we if we can't figure out
what to do with it in the next few days
to fix it probably will recommend to the
customer to just RMA it and EJ is good
about that they'll definitely take care
of the customer but ideally it doesn't
happen at all so whose fault that is
we're not clear right now it is a
reference PCB which is made by Nvidia's
team so we'll see we'll see if there's a
common thread but thank you for watching
if you want to support more content like
this as we dig into the rest of the
customer cards that were sent to us on
