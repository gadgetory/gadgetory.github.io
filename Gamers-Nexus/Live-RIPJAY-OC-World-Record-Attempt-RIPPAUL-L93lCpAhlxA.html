doing an envy link live overclocking
stream today originally in response to
Paul but before I get further on that
let me know if you can hear us okay
stream should be coming up momentarily
he should be able to see us at this
point so let me know if you can hear me
if you can we'll keep going so this is
originally Paul is sort of jumped in our
last stream where I was working on just
okay cool people are saying we can hear
you sounds good okay cool thank you very
much alright so here's what happened we
did a live stream about a week ago with
a single card and it ended up being the
XC Ultra from EVGA which is in there now
and so our goal was 7400 points we
reached the goal and then Paul well
technically Paul reached the goal first
he joined our stream and he tweeted and
said something about how he tweeted like
a screenshot of it with like rip Jeon or
something like that and then 30 seconds
later he tweeted and said this was
either perfectly times are very poorly
times because we hit the same like just
passed him and score at the same time as
he hit our target so now I think the
latest is
I lost Paul's updated I think we were
both at Saudi for 35 points for graphics
for a single card and then Jay came out
of nowhere and Jay posted a number one
score on times by extreme around the
same time we did our envy link testing
so can't have that of course we already
had a repel TT stream and Linus sadly
never responded so well he kind of did
he said he tried the 4gb 100 cuadros and
didn't work out so he'll so now we got a
now we gotta go after whoever's left
which is going to be Jay because as we
all know and Jay of course knows this
within a matter of a week or weeks it
will be completely impossible for Jay or
myself to be number one probably number
two or number three on the board because
people who are actually really really
skilled in overclocking or arcane been
well we'll take all those spots so we're
gonna take it while we can Jay had his
turn to be number one I'm going to
my turn to be number one and then
neither of us will ever have it again
until the next launch because the only
way we could really truly compete with
people like kingpin is to have early act
well he has really access to I guess
he's just a nice guy
because kingpin could definitely just
take number one right now either way
it'll be a lot of fun we're gonna try
and beat out Jay this time he's uh he's
got a pretty high score it'll be tough
to beat them but I think we can do it
okay so let me check on chat people say
they can hear things okay cool one
person complained about video quality
but I don't know it looks like it's 1082
me to try changing it manually kingpin
really he's just a nice guy he was a
nice guy actually and I'd yeah he's
probably just sandbagging and letting us
take her for bait he's he's sitting back
and laughing at how he can beat those
his his robot Robo clock or he can beat
those scores while he sleeps
all right so oh yeah how much so some
people have referenced the the rap
battle that was going on on Twitter
where we started oh it started because
Paul joined our stream last time and
I'll keep talking till we got some more
people and Chad its filling up and I
asked Paul so is this is this a beef are
we beefing Paul how does one beef and he
and I both did a lot of research and we
realized that the only way to beef is
through rap so we had a Twitter rap
battle and if you missed it you should
go check it out I think if you just go
to twitter.com slash gamers access
scroll down a bit you'll find the thread
so there were a lot of a lot of a lot of
POC and Biggie references in there some
kill shot references a lot of fun Jay
joined didn't - out of out of nowhere
again as he does okay are you doing I
want to know so we've got a 1,100 people
in chat here now I think it's probably
about time to show the bench and then
I'll we can start doing some
overclocking yes I know there's I know
there is fan noise one person some fan
noise lowers the high quality feel yes
well can we show them the bench I can't
do anything about the fan noise I'm so
sorry this is the best we're gonna be
able to do because this is a pretty a
pretty hot system wants it to go
gets going so can we see this okay it
looks like we can see it decently the
closer I get the worse it'll be on audio
sorry but I'll walk you through it and
Andrews just inching the camera closer
so we can get a shot of it give us a
second here rap Jesus all right okay so
what we have we have a decent shot of it
now what we have is a lot of fans here
here's what I did so first of all for
this we didn't do really anything all
that special
I wanted to chill the the radiator in
here you're gonna hear a lot of noise
from this thing sorry I wanted to chill
the radiator in this bucket or get like
an actual like cooler like you know
something you take for beer or something
like that and chill it but we decided we
won't do it for this stream maybe for
the next one if we need it and what we
have is a 360 super-fat radiator with
three fans on it we've got a soon on fan
which is a maglev fan this is the
original supplier for Corsairs ml fans
they might I think they still are so
that's three thousand rpm we have two
coarse hair ml fans next to it we've got
it's just whatever I can find really
knock to a 140 up on top of the two env
linked GPUs and that's exhaust so we
really need that because back here
here's the problem I needed more intake
because the hybrid model is what we're
using doesn't have direct cooling on the
vram or anything well it doesn't have a
heatsink and I did try to put some heat
sinks on there but gave up on it because
mounting a fan to the back and blasting
it through the front cools the left half
of the vrm on both these cards it gets
some of the memory and then this fan
here in the front which is mounted to
the bench pushing air that way it hits
the rest of the memory and so actually
hitting everything with a thermal probe
which at this point is impossible
because the amount of fans I just you
can use an IR account at this point it's
okay because there's not really an
omission emissivity issue here at this
point the memory is cooler than the
stock cooler was even when it's
overclocked so it's like 50 degrees
Celsius which is crazy
about down a 28 over ambient or
something like that so yeah very good
thermals on everything here and it's
just a lot of fans though so three fans
there two here one here so we got six
right there two more on the radiator for
the 28th ETI hybrid which I further
modded I did a shunt mod on it and we
probably won't really be able to get a
shot of that but it's just two shots
that are shorted and then I've got um I
just did liquid metal on it so it's not
even that big of a shunt mod and then we
have the two BRM fans down there and
we've got an EK whatever that is on a
super atmosphere something like that
it's like a 2016 blaack in case we
promise you on there pulled our Intel
knock Hades Canyon mod parts off so the
Hades Canyon acrylic bench has been
stripped which is rather sad because I
did like that system a lot and that's
what's left of it but I'll probably
remount the hades canyon board in there
just the liquid cooling parts we needed
for this and then the pump van just
shows you the pump you'll see that it's
a I just took a block of wood and
screwed the pump into that and then
clamped that to the table so it doesn't
tip over because I had some issues with
it being kind of loose so that's most
the test batch verges setup looks better
yeah you know I Andrew I think they're
saying stuff about the verge saying the
verge is setup is better just it really
just hurts my feelings to see that I
worked really hard on this and it's just
sad you know it's just sad this
definitely was the awkward way to move
the camera I've ever seen speak not of
the verge and I think you know they're
right you're they're right the Verge's
setup is better and I think there's only
one way can you pass me the tweezers I
need to improve this you just the
tweezers please thank you this as for
the tweezers these I specifically asked
for tweezers
thank you okay so we got some tweezers
so now now I think we can compete with
the
and they're set up I'll just maybe a
little later so that's the setup we've
got it don't you have a camera slider
yes how long do you think it is it's not
like 20 feet well hon um so yeah did you
use their own face so we've got a couple
of things for the compound let me go
we've got 2,000 people in chat here now
so welcome everyone we're doing a rip J
rip Paul stream are you overclocking 2nv
link cards we just showed the setup I'll
walk through it again as we keep going
through the stream I've got to walk you
through some of the thermal compound we
use power supply all the rest of the set
up but first the advertiser for the
stream is power color because I was
looking recently and Vega 56 and 64 have
really come down and priced quite a bit
since the mining boom which is great
because Vega 56 if you remember we liked
a lot in our reviews but then it was
like gone and you couldn't buy it or it
was overpriced so checking recently it's
actually finally back at reasonable
price levels so as the RX 580 we have a
link to the RX 580 as part of power
colors ad with us in the description
below so if you've wanted a mid-range
card the 580 is actually coming down in
price quite a bit these days back to
where it should be and the deals are
pretty good now they also come with
three games so it's a screed Odyssey and
two of the two lesser known games one of
them is a space RPG made by star doc
that actually interested me a bit but I
don't know if I'll time for it but maybe
you will so that's in the link in the
description below if you want to check
it out so the rest of the bench the
waterblock for the cpu is on top of cryo
na I use cryo not for the paste covering
the whole IHS it is not a direct eye
contact and then under the IHS we have
liquid metals freezing stocks or not and
that is straight to the 79-80 XE so the
cpu yes you're very funny is a 79 80 XE
and reviving the old medium now and I
think that covers the CPU side of things
Bri was plenty cool our modded EFI
2080 Ti is using a be quiet silent loop
280 that just happened to fit a
supremacy Evo would also fit that but I
only had one and then the other card is
the EVGA XE ultra which I have not
modded at all not even a shunt mod so
that's that's most up and then
there's an ax 1600 I for the power
supply memory is g.skill Triton Z 3600
we have successfully clocked this stuff
pretty high to 4000 so I went back and
used it again we use it in the repel tt
stream and then we got a fan controller
because there are a lot of fans okay so
let me let me mute that phone so at this
point I think I need to get a baseline
test in here and the where are your
tweezers we just had our tweezers
alright so baseline here's what I do
complete baseline I'm not even gonna
overclock anything what we're doing is a
stock test we like to do these just to
see like how far can we how far have we
come by the end of the stream so 79 80
XE stock no changes at all so we're all
Auto everything in Auto clock Auto
voltage everything's out and then memory
I'm going to manually set to XMP one I'm
also gonna set I already did this set
the voltage to 1.35 just so there's no
weird crashes with it and we need UEFI
mode enabled which it is and then
harbour monitor we're just gonna max the
fans as well you know I'm gonna wait on
Max and the fans I'm no I'm definitely
gonna forget if I wait so we're gonna
max the fans out now and and then let's
this one does not be need to be maxed
this is the what is this this is the vrm
fan the EVGA x2 99 dark motherboard uses
a vrm fan so how you set this to auto I
don't know let's just set it's like 60
it's pretty fast fan anyway alright so
that's what we're doing now everything
stock let's get a baseline in and then
start overclocking and I need to also
get J score up here so we can go over
this and I'm kind of glancing at chat a
little bit I'll read some of it after we
get started on the first test I see some
super chats thank you for sending those
in but uh okay so let's let's pull up J
score first so we have an idea of what
the target is today
one second okay this and this need to be
in the same window and Jay got a very
respectable score and of course this is
all a friendly thing we're not actually
not actually a mad at Jay he did a great
job with his party acts content we're
all trying to make something out of a
launch that is otherwise disappointed a
lot of people can you see that okay okay
so I can't really see the screen anymore
but so the score is here here's what
we're doing I'm not trying to get like
world record number one for all because
that's kingpin and that's unachievable
time spy extreme is what I'm looking at
I'm just using the 3d mark hall-of-fame
not hardware bought this time and for
two cards specifically J's up in number
one so big congrats to Jay pretty cool
that to see someone from the YouTube
space get up there and of course we we
enjoy going back and forth with Jay and
making it a fun competition and then
time our I'm not sure who this is
actually a time art from Germany in
number two with 220 ATT eyes as well so
we've got two people 220 ATT eyes and
Jay is at 14000 43 points four total
times by extreme sport score and then
time art is at 13,000 3 41 so that's a
pretty significant difference just
between those two which means I'm gonna
have a hell of a climb to get through to
get to where J is but I think we can get
close or pass him if we go to Jay's
detailed results you can still see that
ok what we'll see is so there's a score
but for what am I looking for here
there's details graphics score so J for
graphics got 14,000 884 time spike
extreme is extremely heavily weighted on
graphics it's predicated on it so we are
going to need to get very close to this
or passed it in order to beat his total
score cpu score contributes a lot and J
sitting at 10,000 638 we previously
passed the CPA score and a rip LTT
stream I think we're 11,000 something so
I'm somewhat confident we can get there
again barring any kind of silicon
degradation since that time so I'm
hoping we can at least leverage our CPU
and memory overclocking
to gain any potential difference that we
might lose in the graphics core because
J has an extremely high graphics core so
that's that's what we're looking at and
I think it's time to run a baseline test
as well so let me flip this back around
check on chat and everything and we'll
start a simple baseline benchmark so
chat someone says Jade did direct AC
cooling yeah I mean that's pretty cool
literally I guess but well we got this
so alright yeah I totally recommend you
check out Jays videos if you haven't
seen them it's it'll be a fun back and
forth with them and we like his content
okay so very basic absolute bare bones
everything I'm not even going to open
precision it should let's see how the
fans not spinning fans are not spending
right now which means precision is not
doing anything so all I'm gonna do is
run times by extreme this will give us a
complete baseline and then we'll work up
from there this includes two graphics
tests and a CPU test graphics test one
is very intensive on geometry it's very
geometrically complex and graphics test
2 does a lot of stuff that's very
intensive on memory so if we need to
gain a couple points we can try pushing
the memory a bit harder to gain some
more points in graphics test 2 and make
up some of our potential disadvantages
there if we have any alright so while
this is hopefully launching and we'll
check on the thermals too just to make
sure all that looks okay but I'll do
that after a baseline oh yeah man Paul
Paul I think is doing single-car Diaz at
74 35 or something like that we might
come around to that but I'm gonna focus
on this dual card testing today so quick
note while this is doing its first test
on the on the store we have the mod mats
in stock now like properly and stocks
Lee just got in today actually just got
here so that'd be this mod mat that were
working on on top of the workbench and
you can grab one on store that gamers
next to Staton that if you want to grab
it and I wonder who's backward it your
orders are going out over the
few days anyone who orders today of
course your order go out in the same
time period more or less immediately at
this point so they're in stock thank you
to everyone who supported us by picking
those up we're very proud of the product
super high quality build quality and
very useful we think for things like
shorting shunts because it's got the pin
outs right there on it so we've used
that very much and yeah so one says I
need a mod matte mini Nicholas says that
we are working on one
I think the samples came in with this
order I haven't been over to check them
out yet but I will be when I go over to
autograph some of the mats for people
who bought the signed ones I'll be
picking up the the samples for the
medium mod matte and hopefully they're
good and we can start producing those
and I'll go over the rest of the stuff
later so just want to shout that out
we're still going through graphic steps
one it looks like let me check on i'll
check super chat first uncheck the the
rest of the chat see what's happening so
he's a mixed bag haha alright
so bazinga X $5 thank you very much
missing X hashtag rich a hashtag rift
Paul all hail tech G is this not sure
how I feel about that but I very much
appreciate the support hopefully I don't
let you down next one Alok $2.00 Chinese
food fund very much appreciated we we do
like to get food after the stream ends
because this involves standing which is
it's pretty it's pretty hard actually
most of the job is sitting and this
requires muscles that we don't normally
need to use WC current $2.00 thank you
watch but what CPU is it very funny WC
current thinking that I've forgotten the
meme in fact I have not and I do
remember I think was from RIP ltte when
that first started happening I was still
happening in fact I even memorized the
name of an obscure Intel CPU because
people kept asking what CPU is it and
that was for the Nook so this one if
anyone's actually curious and not just
trying to troll me is a 79 80 X E which
is Intel's current highest score counts
h EDT cpu and we have it clock to stock
so it's like 2.6 gigahertz right now
base anyway and we'll overclock it
shortly closer to 5 all right the next
question I'm Rock Fox $2 what is the CPU
cat next question Charles Jones
$1.99
can we get a rip verge team I don't I
don't really think that's necessary at
this point I think they got enough of
that
sergeant Zeta 555 just to be different I
guess what would you look like with only
a mush mustache what is your definition
of only in this scenario is it is it
like my entire being on this planet is
replaced with a single mustache because
then it would look like a mustache
next one Julian but Tom yak $5.00
where your wireless anti-static bracelet
you're going to short the system
exclamation exclamation exclamation yes
well as we all know it could have
potentially hundreds of watts running
through it and that's how you measure
danger in all seriousness with this one
I don't know what the power draw is but
we plugged in the stream system under
the table to a different circuit and in
another room the extension cord just in
case because I think the CPU will be
drawing several hundred watts it's
probably gonna be the CPU platform
motherboard all the cooling is
definitely gonna be over 500 watts for
sure it'll probably be closer like six
seven hundred and then the GPU is I
actually I'm not sure I haven't tested
it but will be pretty high up there so
split on my two different circuits your
uh Shrey CHF 420
let's get those clocks reference to last
stream yes we are definitely gonna get
those this time hopefully most things by
Mat $20 thank you very much
I need help cloning my hard drive I have
a 2 terabyte drive and I'm cloning it to
a 4 terabyte I initialized the new
drivers GPT every time I try to clone it
only clones the 2 terabyte and locks out
the rest of the new drive have you so
it's paid software but it might be worth
trying to Cronus we use it I used to use
Clonezilla and never really had issues
with it it boots into a Linux like boot
rescue OS well actually no that's not
true you can get a camera over the name
of the disc I used to use gparted though
what
gparted yeah gparted is another one that
we've used Clonezilla gparted there's
our baseline score and a Cronus are all
worth trying Acronis we haven't had any
issues with so okay baseline score this
is zero
anything no overclock no GPU over clocks
nothing so our baseline here we're
starting this is where we're gonna
reference for this tonight to see how
far we've come and hopefully it is
somewhere
our starting score and I'm gonna log it
here so let's see score GPU score CPU
score I just take a note of this so full
stock we're at 11 904 GPU is at 12 nine
nine five twelve thousand nine
ninety-five CBUs I 8016 I know that's a
bad score that is so bad okay
so for reference J J's total score we're
at 11 904 for that with nothing applied
J is at 14000 43 pretty damn good and
that's what his overclocking so we've
got a ways to climb here and then for
graphics score we're at 12 we're about
13,000 where he was at 14,000 884 and
our CPU score is at 8,000 and he's at 10
638 so that's that's what we have to
beat here
score to beat score to beat tonight the
number to remember is 14,000 43 I think
and but I guess at this point we can do
a quick baseline overclock on the CPU
just to get that up to speed because our
CPU is really dragging us down here so
let's start with that and we'll move on
to the GPUs next and I will check chat
while I hit delete a whole bunch okay
and it looks like some people in chat if
anyone's you know an expert you do a lot
of Drive cloning Mustaine's by Matt
could use some advice on good software
for Drive cloning I gave a couple but if
you have better ones than me certainly
share them we we do enough cloning to
clone systems for testing but it's not
like I do it all day okay so let's let's
get this going here let's do a perk or
overclock I'm gonna set it to 40 let's
just start at 46 I think so that'll give
us 4.6 gigahertz and then we can
probably push mesh I'm gonna push this
higher in a bit too so let's get rid of
the AV X offset turned out to 0 if you
don't know what a VX offset is it
negatively offsets the clock so if it's
46 and we have an offset of 3 they'll
drag the clock down to four point three
gigahertz when a VX workloads are
applied and time spike extreme does
actually use a VX in some of its tests
so this is actually a relevant thing
another example B prime 95 uses a VX or
at least versions pass 26.6 do let's set
match ratio to just 34 now push that
more later and then meshed by the way is
a big deal for these h EDT platforms
that really needs to be overclocked to
get anywhere we have extreme voltage
modes let's put put that two on yes we
know it can destroy everything that's
fine
I'm going to set then to 1.95 and then V
core we don't actually need 1.3 here but
I'm going to pin it kind of put it to
1.3 because I'm not gonna have to mess
with it for the rest of the night for
the most part if it's there so that'll
just make things easier for us and like
the cooling can handle it so we'll just
leave it 1.3 it'll work no one wants to
watch like an hour of me fine-tuning the
voltage so V mesh so override that as
well we'll set V mesh to 1.35 we could
probably get away with 1.3 but I'm gonna
be increasing mesh there and somebody's
well just jump the gun on that system
agent voltage for actually if you droop
let's disable this and then a system
agent voltage this is what helps with
stabilizing the IMC so that'd be the
integrated memory controller if you
start pushing memory over clocks
it definitely helps to increase the
system agent you have to be very careful
with this number like you start pushing
1.3 1 by 4 this the IMC will degrade
over time it could be a matter of months
could be a year but eventually it won't
be able to hold the same memory clocks
at the same low voltages if you just
blast the voltage unnecessarily or even
even if you can think it might be worth
stepping down your frequency to lessen
the strain from SI io voltage we have
set to 1.2 as well I'm going to overkill
on most things right now but not that
overkill this isn't crazy so just enough
to make things go smoothly here uncor
off set we're gonna do 500 and let's
millivolts not volts and then that
should be good for all of these settings
so we're gonna leave BC LK alone so
we've got a 4.6 gigahertz clock 30 on
the mesh that'll be increased later I'm
leaving XMP on profile 1 and we'll do
memory overclocking towards the end it's
no sporting part but it does get a lot
of it gains and then 1.35 for a stable
dim voltage we can increase that a lot
later so I think the rest let's turn off
see States shouldn't really matter but
just in case I think the rest should be
good to go who drives UEFI our fans
should be maxed out yes they are except
for the vrm fan but that's fine so ok
let's save that and run another just a
CPU test and see how that improves our
scores get a baseline
it's yelling at me for some reason I've
forgotten to do something I think so
what's what's chat up to you I'm looking
at normal chat now we'll put super chat
on hold while it's so quiet with all the
when it reboots Paul Owens Paul's
hardware that is accurate
someone says ok so it did not like one
of the settings I did I might have
missed out something let's just excuse
the fan noise for a second let me hit
that safe boot button so some boards
like this EVGA want a lot of ACS ones
have a red button on them that's a safe
boot which is really nice to have
because it'll keep all the settings and
let you get back in without blowing them
away so I think I must have missed
something or miss type something all
right
did you source a fan taxi evolved axe
yes we have one on the way actually a
viewer sent one along so that's going I
don't know when I think we get that in a
couple days probably so we'll have that
soon we'll be reviewing they evolve X
it's been a while since you reviewed of
van tax case a lot of you really wanted
us to review this one so we do have one
on the way and thank you again to the
reviewer who sent or the mother reviewer
the viewer who sent one along for us to
borrow all right there we go so f12
dunder setup let's see what I missed
and what's chat saying I was about to go
to bed but then I saw a gamer's Nexus is
challenging the verge in OSI no no we're
not doing that
oh that's really I don't think we need
to do that that's just unnecessary
alright so I did something here where I
must have missed a number or something
thirty match ratio extreme voltage
enabled yes
no not 14 volts that would be very bad
1.95 that's for VIN right yes vcore
override 1.3 okay be a bit more careful
what I'm typing this time just in case
the mesh 1.35 is more than enough V
droop off the SI 1.2 vio 1.2 uncor
offset 500 okay all that's good
and then definitely good I think CPU ven
1.95 yes correct 1.3 ok that is all
correct and then memory should be XMP
1.35 that should be ok
ski states off and then we need hardware
info or hardware monitor rather 100 180
and that should do oh you know I think I
need to okay you have eyes on pool okay
that should be bootable all right why
raise Si and IO when you're running XMP
because I'm gonna be raising the memory
clocks shortly and I want to just get it
all out of the way now so that I don't
have to interrupt the stream to reboot a
whole bunch just to change a few voltage
points when I already know I needs
increase those in the milk in a couple
minutes anyway all right looks like it's
booting this time that's good so let me
get a couple super chat question
actually no let me check back on chat
for a second overclock it in a cold
storage room no I was gonna put the CPU
radiator actually and the GPU on in a
nice little ice bucket but we decided to
hold that for now and maybe do that next
time fire extinguisher ready Steve just
a small one yeah just just in case
alright so all I'm gonna do again get a
baseline only CPU clocks this time or
CPU test in not graphics not gonna
bother and then we'll start with a GPU
overclock as well so let's do a quick
CPU only test go do the magic trick of
clicking out and back in 2 times pi
otherwise everything breaks so that's
running will check check thermals in a
bit and you know when you're doing the
fanart stream not sure yet we have
enough where we're going to do like
another fan mail segment and open stuff
you know for that that you all sent in
and we're gonna do a separate one of
probably making like the actual CPU art
we have some ideas for it ice bucket
challenge with a $30,000 rig haha I mean
it would be really cold for a nanosecond
all right so that's running check some
super chats so we last left off Mustangs
bye Matt next one Gabriel $1 70 thank
you very much Gabriel
bazinga X Steve where's your Swiss Army
knife I don't have one and therefore I'm
unqualified to build computers Cory
Thomas $5 thank you very much no message
Ivan's monkey be $20 Norwegian making a
content piece on the Nvidia scanner yes
we will be doing that I have some ideas
for it I'm I won't reveal them just yet
but we're definitely going to be doing
that it's just I don't know so here's
the problem whenever these new
components come out doesn't matter what
it is we try to spend like a week of
just making content on that thing while
everyone cares about it do as much
research as we can while people are
making buying decisions so hopefully we
can have helpful content out there
before you buy stuff and then obviously
people get really sick of that content
so now we're at a point where I'm gonna
have to start like publishing other
stuff that's not GPUs we'll do those
scanner stuff and some other things but
I do want to publish some like some non
GPU content pieces we have some really
good ones coming up in the next few days
Dalton P if I dies what percent
difference in 3d marks between the 79-80
axion 2998 WX I'm actually not sure I
does i don't know it's maybe someone in
chat can tell us I haven't read any of
the 2990 reviews or at least not since
launch but does it run 3 mark with all
cores enabled I'm not sure either way
it's not on the top of the the Hall of
Fame so I don't the problem with 3d mark
is it's extremely core intensive to an
extent and then it really wants
frequency so it wants everything whereas
most games kind of stop at like 4 to 8
cores or threads CPS core ok so let's
just uh let's just update everyone here
that's not even visible is it that's the
number you'd be trying to show but it's
probably small so that number is you
know what I should change this to
probably to 1080p so it's more legible
that number
there we go is and this will still run
at 1440 or whatever times by extreme
runs at just in a row Ron resolution for
the monitor 10,000 737 so to give you an
idea of the growth here Jays score is uh
let's see Jays CBO score is 10 638 this
is the first overclock I've done here
and we're at 10 737 so what we're at
right now is just four point six
gigahertz I know there's more power in
there I've got a 30 mash we have XMP
thirty-six hundred megahertz on like a
CL sixteen or seventeen or something not
great really so now our biggest deficit
is graphics core and then we need to do
some more CPU overclocking so let's
start with the graphics core because I
know that's our weakest point at this
moment to catch his 14,000 total score
we need to increase the graphics so
let's just do an offset of I have a
secret weapon here as well but we'll
talk about that later let's do just max
power targets so we're gonna do the
stock power target and there's a reason
I'm using that word I'll talk about that
in a bit
actually towards the end of the stream
will talk about why 130 percent of stock
and not the rest of this slider so stock
max power target on the XC ultras 130
percent it's a reference PCB with a
higher power target clocks memory I
already know is stable at a thousand
offset and core I think it should be
stable at 200 but let's start out at 180
and just leave it there and then for the
you know let's just run a test like that
I'm just I'm curious how what happens if
we just only overclock the primary card
and leave the secondary one alone see
what kind of score we end up with for
graphics so let's do a full pass of this
just to get our new baseline see if we
can gain some ground on evil J's two
cents full name JT cents do you plan on
making these overclocking streams
regular thing I don't know when there is
new stuff definitely like when new CPUs
come out or new GPUs definitely
okay
case I'm just reading chat snowflake
would sabotage the whole thing because
she is the AMD analyst that's true she
would definitely sabotage streaming
systems because they are all open air
and very vulnerable the cats jumping on
them have you seen the fans on this
thing so right now it's in a you can see
it's scaled down but it's not going to
affect the score it's just because I've
changed the monitor resolution still
running at the full resolution benchmark
it's just tiny because the scaler is all
screwy we can set it back up to 4k
natively once we do the final test just
for safety all right so does that mean
you did the shunt mod if you mean the
secret weapon thing that's not no that's
not what I was referring to I did do a
shunt mod though on one card not both so
our EVGA RX z ultra we have is a crazy
good overclocker the chip is just good
like Silicon Lottery one on that one
the founders edition card not so great
it's fine but it's disappointing by
comparison and it's something like I
don't know I think it sells like a 160
offset and then 854 memory memories the
big limiter on that one so only 850
where's the EVGA card we have which is a
reference port does a thousand on the
memory thousand five so yeah I had I did
the shut mod on the founders edition car
because I was very disappointed in its
capabilities and that should help us out
a bit alright
okay so uh what is a what's what's chat
thinking here so we've got Jay at here's
what I want to know Jay's at 14,000 43
for total score and he is followed by
time art and then slinky PC who's using
2gb 100s so do you do you have faith in
us chat it's not a trick question you
can say now it's okay
I'll have the moderators kick you but
you can say now if you want let me know
do you think we can beat Jays score
that's what I want to see what your
genuine thoughts are someone says the
verge will beat us which is actually the
genuinely the most hurtful thing I've
ever read in my life so that's just
really I hope you're proud of yourself
gotta get we've got a mix mix of yes and
no if you're saying no and you mean it
tell me why why do you think Jay is set
up is superior is it the air
conditioning thing is that it is that
all it comes down to I have faith
okay well thank you very much we've got
a ways to go I think we can at least get
close okay so one says no one is better
and while I appreciate it you are so
wrong if if you like this kind of stuff
and you want to see more of it I'm
getting better at it really slowly but
the people I learned from are great to
watch so if you really like overclock
and you're interested in it I would
highly encourage you to check out their
Bauer on YouTube he is a professional
overclocker you can check out build Zoid
he does collaborative work with us on
this channel from PCB analysis videos
and of course kingpin doesn't really
post to youtube but he does post scores
you can follow him on the three more
Call of Fame there are plenty of others
too but those are the the two main guys
I follow our builds ID and dare Bauer if
you want to check some out but we are
doing some more as well just not quite
as competently haha alright your setup
is more quote just buy it I mean yeah
it's that's yeah I talked about this
with the Titan V stuff you can kind of
buy your way to the top these days I
would really like to see price divisions
come into play for 3d marks Hall of Fame
or for
or harbor bots so you can have like a
division of like I don't know setups
under $1500 that was under $1000 it'll
be pretty cool so then everyone can join
them and if you do want to join in to do
some of your own overclocking compare
the scores just to see how crazy like
228 et eyes are versus your setup you
can it's free
we're not sponsored by them or anything
I just really like 3dmark and they're
good developers they do good work so you
can check it out if you want to follow
along at home we only got one camera
view yeah I mean it's it's mobile like
Angie's Manning it when we show stuff
but we don't do live capture of the
bench system because it crashes from
BSOD and stuff like that from
overclocking all the time scale is all
screwy because I shrunk it for for the
camera so we don't do a live feed from
this because it just is really it's
problematic it's not worth it
so 12,000 956 so just to recap everyone
we currently are on a 4.6 gigahertz OC
on the 790 XC this is pretty low I can
get it higher so the score we started
with baseline was 11,000 904 if those
numbers don't mean a lot to you you can
kind of just split into percentages and
look at it that way going from 11900 to
gaining a thousand points is actually a
lot times pi times my extreme is really
intensive it is heavily predicated on
the graphics core so the graphics core
matters the most for getting this total
number up with times pi extreme and the
cpu score is also important but not
nearly as important so CVS core ten
seven five seven
we started with eighty nine eighty sixty
nine so 10 7 5 7 s the new scrum just
taking a note of all this and we have a
GP score of 13 4 4 1 we have a total
score of 12 9 5 6 ok so for comparison J
is at 14000 43 for his total score so J
you know 14,000 43 is pretty good I'll
give it to you I got to give you that
give you some respect
I'm going to I want to hand you some
respect right now J feel free to take it
go ahead and take your time
but I'm gonna take that back from you as
soon as we beat your score but you can
have the respects for now and I would
like if you know if you want to if you
want to show je your appreciation or or
how sad you will be when we take it back
from him feel free to press f for
aspects for J or as we crash the system
as we continue to overclock so that's
what we got with one card overclock
let's just and that's all stock power
not playing any games here this one is
the shunt modded card so I'm going to
push this just a 150 core I think it can
go a bit further but I'm not sure
exactly how much an 800 memory I think
it can do 850 let's start there though
just to minimize crashing for right now
and we're only going to do a graphics
test for this one so that we don't have
to sit through for the whole thing just
make sure it doesn't freak out okay so
let's let's let that go see how that
does and and for the end here when we do
the final test and all set it back to 4k
native just to make sure there's no
score screwy from changing the
resolution as I said made at 1080p just
to check and see it easier secret weapon
is delayed and liquid metal actually no
but the CPU is deleted and it does have
liquid metal it's just not secret so
you're giving J&amp;amp;F but you're taking it
back later
brutal someone says 4k negative 200
scaling yeah I guess I could do that
whatever okay J is West Coast steam is
the only one we have on the East Coast
rock on rip J rip Paul that's damn right
I'm gonna represent the east side even
though when I started the diss raps with
Paul I was quoting POC and he was
quoting biggie but whatever details
alright
RTX hey B reviews coming soon yep so
we've been waiting on BIOS updates the
the problem someone's got a question
about mods I'll get to it the problem
with these launches is that cards like
the BIOS is changing almost daily it's
mostly finalized now but the reviewer
samples started shipping around or just
before the retail samples did and so we
have to update the BIOS on everything
otherwise it's not representative of
what you're buying
so that has delayed us a bit
as for the question someone saying did
you you Steve where are your feet on the
ground
where are yours stone was asking about
liquid metal for shunt modding so I know
it's question here's the thing I
benchmark stuff and then I clean it off
so the the concern is Lewis rossmann did
a video a while ago where someone sent
in a Titan X P or something that had a
shunt resistor falling off because they
had modded it with liquid metal and the
gallium where the indium was eating
through the solder and caused a problem
so I'm aware of that but if you don't
use an absurd amount of liquid metal
like on the solder joints it should be
okay I'm not gonna guarantee it
the best way to do this is to piggyback
another shunt resistor on it but I don't
I have liquid metal and I don't care
about the cards like future prospects
because I'm gonna clean it off as soon
as the streams done so it actually
doesn't really matter for areas case if
you want to do a long term shot mod you
should probably piggyback another shunt
resistor off of it like solder went on I
don't know if you should use like three
million or what but I think they're
Bower in builds avoid builds would
definitely his channel is actually
hardcore overclocking you should check
it out bill joy posted I think a video
about a shunt resistor piggyback mod for
these cards or something that's the best
way to do it I just did it the quickest
way so alright Steve has no feet confirm
okay so for the Super chats let me get
back to a couple of these oh you know
what I should I should mention first the
beer glasses came back into stock during
the last stream so they got weather
delayed a bit but they're shipping
neither today or tomorrow so if you want
one you grabbed one on store that gamers
accessed on that it got it's got the
gold rim on it and I cobalt blue glass
and it's it's I think it's pretty unique
has the teardown logo on it so if you
missed the foil shirt which is back
there forever now because there are no
more left other than the ones that I'm
wearing once that you all bought you
wanted that logo it is on the beer
glasses and some of our other shirts but
all other shirts are out of stock right
now
I think we have we have a good amount of
inventory of these Graff logo shirts
though so what I'm wearing today is on
stored I can't recycle Annette the graph
logo by the way if you don't know the
story behind it the three bars are just
from the the charts we make it's like
the same colors as the charts we make
that's the whole it's average one
percent in point one percent Louis
that's the secret behind the shirt so
for a graphic score we got 14 seven
seven eight this is kind of passion I
expected
where was J 14 seven seven eight is what
we got when it is JJ is 14 eight eight
four damn well that's quick okay we need
to push the CPU to make sure we can
actually be this total score though it's
right now we're close
Jay's got about 100 points on us here
the problem is those hundred points are
weighted a lot more than our CPU what do
we have we have about a hundred point
lead on him and CPU but his graphic
scores weighted way more heavily so that
is a a problem for us but I do have some
more left in the tank and we can push
some more so it's I'm gonna take a note
of the score here and figure out what
we're gonna do next let me check the
Super chats and chat and everything as
well and then we can get back to some
overclocking CPU overclocking especially
all right so super chat we had a
question from keep scrolling up dammit
we had a question for someone I think
the name was Mohan Mohan $5.00 1440p 100
hertz ultrawide monitor currently have a
gtx 960 what card do you recommend not
interested in ultramatic settings just
want solid performance per dollar and
framerate so ultra wide 1440p that's
what is that 30 34 40 by 1440 PA or by
1440 I think that's the resolution so if
you currently have a 960 and upgrade a
lot honestly the 10 series is pretty
affordable right now and the 20 series
left a lot to be desired as I think chat
would agree with that so man if you can
find a 1070 for a decent price 3 400
bucks then that's well yeah that's
probably good way to go
1070 is a good card as well we like that
one almost more than a 1080 in a lot of
instances and yeah those those two cards
at the price today are good and will be
fine if you don't need Ultramax crazy
graphics and you don't need like 140 FPS
if you're trying to hit 100 poly push
towards the higher end but 1070 guys get
choice middle ground that's affordable
depend of your budget okay couple more
post-apocalyptic Peter 2:2 colors if
build Zoid had kingpins budget would he
take the crown that's a good question
I got a I don't know that's tough one
kingpins if you missed it his Robo
clocker is crazy we have a video of it
on our channel so if you search the
channel I think for Robo claw here
you'll find it it's like basically a
closed loop cooler for liquid nitrogen
it has to what is it like hundred eighty
liter tanks on either side or something
like that with liquid nitrogen
one pumps it in the other one pumps it
out and if it condenses cool they can
reuse it so that's pretty hard to beat
but I believe I believe in builds I'd
and his crazy zombie power mods that he
does it'd be a good fight I think I
think build Zoid with enough budget
could do it it was hard to beat a guy
who's employed by EVGA though method
method $5 interested in doing a deep
dive into how to overclock more than
just voltage and multiplier I think I
have more Headroom but not sure what to
adjust let's just reboot into into BIOS
and I'll show you a couple options
so for GPUs there's really not a ton you
can do friend video but for CPUs there's
a lot you can do especially on an h EDT
platform like the one we're working with
today and what is a see Jacob from EVGA
just messaged me and said get kingpin in
the livestream they say I'm working on
it so I guess those of you who have who
have been posting that you want kingpin
on the stream it sounds like we might be
able to make that happen
I don't think Robo clock is coming
though I don't know it Jacob is Robo
clock are coming is that ready quiet
like an extra plane ticket
so you wanted a deep dive I'm not gonna
give you a deep dive on overclocking I'm
not really I don't think I'm fully
qualified for that but so for an HDD to
platform I'll give you some pointers
core of course is important but it's not
everything and in what we're doing here
today actually just only adjusting core
wouldn't get us anywhere so things to
consider you can do an all core
overclock it's the easiest to most
stable if you feel like it you can kind
of more or less bin the cores where you
let's say you know that 40 let's see you
know 46 is stable but not 47 for example
you could set 46 for everything then
maybe just change like four cores 247
and see is that stable and you just keep
doing that until you find the the higher
clocking cores and and SEP there's a bit
higher now that's a huge pain in the ass
not necessarily worth it mesh ratio on h
EDT is really worth overclocking and
uncor on the your standard desktop
platforms would be what you want to look
for so mesh ratio for Intel anyway mesh
ratio is is a huge sleeper impact on OC
results if we set this to auto or like
28 or something the score will be
significantly different than if we put
it to 30 and it's really not hard to get
to 30 we can even get to 33 here and so
if you feel like you've capped out on
your core then definitely on a EDT mesh
is a good place to look encore is a good
place to look good sort of rule of thumb
for like an 80 86 K or something in ages
700 K would be to keep your uncor maybe
three or four ticks below your core
offset at a baseline and then increase
it as much as you're able to other
options let's say you're going more
practical for your overclock and you
have issues with like blender say you're
a blender user but you also play games
most games don't use a VX so you're not
gonna run into a VX stability issues but
blender does so you're rendering stuff
and your overclock isn't stable in that
application you can set an AV X offset
that's a good trick as well for a
practical use case we're not not for one
we're doing today BC okay this is
something you can do a little bit on AMD
and Intel so you can push it like
101-102 101.5 stuff like that and that
will increase the speed of pretty much
everything on the system by just a
little bit so
the memory is a product of the base
clock and the memory multiplier so if
you increase the base clock without
changing memory it'll still increase the
memory speed if you increase the base
clock I mean actually just demo it for
you I think this BIOS auto-updates maybe
not sure but if you increase base clock
it will multiply by 46 in this case so
instead of 100 101 so that's a good
trick to use you can use let's see
memory overclocking is really difficult
but if you have the patience for it the
voltages you want to look at memory
voltage is is extremely resilient you
can push like 1.5 volts really without
any issue on Intel or Andy maybe 1.4 but
1.5 is generally safe on Intel and AMD
we actually push like 1.8 1.8 v on these
the sticks can take it for sure so it's
a question how long the MC can take it
so 1.5 is a better bet there for Intel
platforms and then 1.2 sa on this
platform is unnecessary for what we're
doing right now but if you have
stability issues with IMC and with the
IMC for memory overclocking the voltage
to looked at is is si and I'm revolted
and you can look at one quarter voltage
to other stuff hopefully that gives you
some ideas that was a LAN super Chad
answer but we needed to be here anyway
so let's just go ahead and set this to
47 and see if it's stable I think it
should be we can push it a bit more
later I want to increase the mesh ratio
as well but I'm going to wait on that
until we see how this 47 X does Scarlett
Tech 499 any progress of the thrown pad
testing yes so I was working on it with
the IC x cards for the last generation
the 10 series but I think at this point
on a wait for EVGA to send us their new
IC x cards because the cool thing with
our TX is it runs really hot and for
thermal pad testing if you want like an
exciting result you need something
really hot to exaggerate those
differences because the lower end the
car or the not even lower end 1080i
still high on with a lower heat output
on the card the less exaggerated the
differences will be so it'll be a
scenario where I think a lot of the time
we'll see the throne passes are pretty
much the same for the low-end card but
for high-end cards I want to know does
it actually really start to matter if
you use like Fuji poly or something
yes it is still on my calendar I am
waiting for sampling at this point of
icx and I think EVGA is they've got at
least one person watching somebody will
they'll see this evj by the way if you
were wondering about kingpin coming on
the stream EVGA says Robo cocker needs
an extra first-class ticket it's
basically a person at this point it's
not even really unfair that came van
what's his name on the scores it's more
or less well that's the first fully
autonomous entity on the planet okay so
let's do a CPU test just to see if those
changes worked and while that's running
like I said if you go to store documents
acts it's not that we've restocked a lot
of the stuff shirts we have limited
stock on some of them but the graph
logos there and then we've got the mod
mats are in stock and shipping now so
they're finally back in we have to order
them in batches because we're not a
massive like manufacturing company so
order them in batches based on demand
and obviously use that money to order
the next batch so those are back in
stock and then I'll also mention this
while we get that test running if you
haven't seen these this is our teardown
crystal so you open up OVS so I can see
what's going on on stream that's the box
comes in I don't believe in unboxings
unless it's my own product so the
teardown crystals are pretty sweet they
come with an LED base as well and it's
get the right orientation here can you
get a shot of that and show the detail
or do you need more light so I think we
need some more light so this thing's
pretty cool the level of details is good
on it
let's drop the weight right on the test
bench I think that'd be good anyway so
we have some shots of it elsewhere but
it's a 3-dimensional laser etched thing
so you can see like it's got PCB there
you go
got PCB components in there so it has
like I really like this product that we
have
it's got screws so you can see screws
back here sticking out it has like VRMs
on there I mean if you were to like
replicate it and try and make it on a
PCB I don't think it works but it's got
V Rams got like blower fan stuff like
that so anyway that's on the store if
you want to pick it up but so let's get
back to chat super chat all that stuff
and move the light back to where it
probably should be
I think our CPU test just finished see
if we have any chance of beating J's
total score of 14,000 what is it 43 so
CPU oh that's looking good we're at
10,000 900 a time the CPU which I think
puts us past J so I didn't even change
10 908 was that with 4.7 I even changed
the mass yet was J's score so J for a
CPU and we need to pick this up to gain
graphics to make up for graphics
differentials J's at 10 638 this isn't
enough so we push it a bit more let's
let's go ahead and do that let's let's
push this CPU a bit more and then we'll
start overclocking the GPU harder and I
still have a secret weapon in there so I
haven't told anyone what it is yet but
there is in fact a secret weapon that I
can use for the GPU overclocking however
I want to hold it is that high enough I
wanna hold it because when I beat J's
score I would like to be able to do it
without using special access like any
kind of extras so what we are going to
do is just push the CPU as much as we
can and then push the GPUs as much as we
can out of the box the only mods we've
done to the GPU is the founders Edition
card I say only it's got a liquid cooler
on it let's
fair he has a liquid color on to his to
his looks way better and more
professional but I was the only other
mod we've done as a shunt resistor mod
where we shorted the shunts and let's
let's go to CPU up to make up some of
our difference here so I need a sumesh
let's push that up to try 30 to see what
that does for us where that'll impact EP
score a bit too so that that should be a
good starting point and then you know
what memory it's probably time to start
bumping that so let's push this to 1.5
see if it's stable I should really only
change one of these at a time but
whatever and let's change this to 4000
mega Hertz will come back for timings
later let's try that 4000 mega at 1.5
volts I might need to push I say I don't
think so though so that should get us
secret weapon equals AC unit Intel
chiller is Intel's chiller like even
legal like some pretty crazy chiller for
theirs for that 28 core they shunted the
shorts no did I say that now it's not we
shorted the sun's and one other prison
oh my god you got RGB secret weapon
that's actually what it was you've
you've correctly guessed it alright so
see if it is stable for this one super
chats we had one from Julian who said
two dollars at League of Legends greater
than three mark market a benchmark this
with League of Legends thank you very
much Peter
Ross TR 50 DKK finding that hard to find
issue info on mesh overclocking do you
have video explaining that why and how
to do it right hashtag smash the world
record I'd love to do that while we
still can before it becomes impossible
when can kingpin gets the top and it's
it's never again reclaim able but there
should be info on like overclockers
overclockers mesh overclocking that's an
h EDT thing so if you have like a
high-end Intel platform as opposed to
down 8700 K which still high-end but
relatively speaking that would be where
that applies it does not apply to like
your 8700 K or something like that look
for uncor for those so I see some
discussion of this on overclocked dotnet
there's a skylake
axé overclocking guide I haven't read
through it all so I can't vouch for it
but there's a sky like exit overclocking
guide that goes over mesh overclocking
that might help you out on overclock net
they have some good guides over there
that are forum regulated alright so we
need to start a test I need to read
super chats
let's do CPU so no graphics again we're
just gonna see did that that is is that
frequency on the memory and the mesh
going to hold for the rest of this I
don't know if it will okay super chats
so we got a Java Don one two three five
dollars do you plan on making these oh I
got that one these overclocking streams
regularly thing so like I said earlier
whenever there's a new product yet
definitely for sure when it there when
there's a new product or if I can get
like don't know their Bower kingpin
build Zoid if we get any of them out
sometime we'll definitely make that a
thing - King moly 20 bucks thanks for
all you do Steve when our TX games
become available I'd love to see 220 ATT
eyes in SLI and see ray-tracing scaling
over sli like 20 gig arrays per second
or or if it does not at all that's a
great question I don't know how it
stacks or if it does stack when you have
when you when you have any kind of ray
tracing in there because I find me a
game that's like real and out with any
kind of RT X in it right now it's kind
of hard so we have demos and that's a
great question though I we are planning
to do some deep dives on our TX games as
they launch I just need them to exist
first before I can work on them but
great question a great point anyway for
testing data my screen went black for a
second I don't know why it does this
David five dollars I think you had a
message we'll find out in a moment if
every comes back have you noticed the
downtrend and views in the weeks you
stream I've seen YouTube videos that
hint at it actually no but that's really
hard to judge because oh it's not
crashing I thought it was the problem is
there are too many variables so I mean
if we upload worst content there's going
to be lower views anyway
or if there's a lot like we streamed
last week these were crazy good but
that's because there was a launch week
so I have no idea
Zeta alpha $5 you can do this I hope so
I share your confidence like I said I
gave I gave Jason respects earlier I
handed it to him I think he accepted it
I can't see through his screen and where
can I and I expect to take the respect
back home by the end of the stream so
CPU score 11,000 144 of course all fun
with J you should check out his channel
if you don't know who he is I'm sure you
do though J is 2 cents if you don't know
who I'm talking about 11 144 on the CPU
what is this mesh of 32 or something or
33 maybe so we have climbs quite a bit
our original CBO score was 80 69 and now
we're at 11,000 and before that we were
at a ten thousand seven fifty seven so
we're gaining quite a bit and that is
exactly exactly what we want to see when
our GPU overclocks might not be as high
as his but we will find out soon ok so
now what push CPU some more I guess I'm
gonna find the limit on the CPU and then
go for a GP overclocking so I guess said
while this is rebooting actually no I
House house chat going I haven't checked
it on the normal chat for a little bit
is Photoshop the secret weapon that's a
good one it should be
how is chat doing secret weapon is a
beauty card I wish will you publish this
live stream after two ends yes yesterday
well here's the problem just in case you
run into this we've noticed that streams
that are like over two hours let's split
initially and then process so only the
last two hours will be available
immediately I think this might be why
Paul and Kyle originally split the
stream but I'm not sure so it will all
be there but you might have to check
back a couple hours after it goes up
because the first two hours will be gone
or whatever the first however long it is
but they will come back so I'm going to
push match ratio to 33 I think at this
point we're gonna start crashing but
let's just go ahead and try that and
see if I can get away with it without
increasing v-match because I'd really
like to avoid that there's a secret
weapon private Internet access no but I
guess they just got a free act haha
Peltier is the secret weapon nope
Steve do you have dry ice no no I did
not I did consider it though something I
want to do I think we're the next big
stream we do for overclocking probably
do an ice bucket the the challenge with
it is condensation and killing parts so
build Zoid from actually hardcore
overclocking gave me some advice he said
get some of that artists like gray
kneadable eraser and just stick it down
all over anywhere under a block and
others obviously not the CPU itself but
the PCB and that will help deal with
condensation drip and then wrap all the
tubing everything that's potentially
exposed for condensation like the
fittings with blue shop towel so I do
want to do some sub ambient not sub-zero
but sub ambient testing and we have the
the office space to do it now it's just
I you know I kind of start working on it
for this and then realized I need some
more materials I don't want to risk
blowing up the board or the CPU because
I'm not prepared so we pushed it off I
think we can still do a rip J rip all
stream without it and actually know it
just in case here I'm going to set the
resolution back I don't think it impacts
anything I'm almost certain it doesn't
but I'm gonna just set the resolution
back to for you and illegible 4k with
100% scaling because 3d mark makes us
all superstitious and see if that
changes the score like lowers it at all
but I don't think it should more likely
we're going to crash because the I
increased be a match without increasing
any voltage anywhere
all right so checked it on chat for a
bit what is that what is that someone
just said J posted something where'd it
go where is it I missed it I missed your
comment something about J posting a
score or something like that
let me check hang on this mouse needs to
be probably then what's this what's the
score
f5 so this score is still the same as he
uploaded a new score for dual GPU no did
he post one on Twitter or something chat
let me know what's going on someone said
something about J posting a score maybe
it was for a single card 11 767 is that
for a CPU what is that for
/ and allow it okay let me just check
his Twitter page myself because people
are saying something about posting alone
which is not a figure out what is that
relax Cory sorry he did post an update
to his personal unbuild though so what
is it what's bloody post I don't know I
missed it whatever was I missed it I
guess 11 7 6 7 CB score today ok gotcha
okay cool thank you alright so anyway
that's running a test I guess we'll have
to push that even higher now if he's
posting in 11700 score and these
comments are not at all helpful okay
Jack treatment five dollars regarding do
we have faith you will beat Jays score
can I get an amen
it's we got another one
two dollars from the pink get Cain Penta
in a video equals content yes we will
definitely I mean it's time adjust
content the guys like the leading expert
on GPU overclock okay ten seven three
five what was our previous score do we
need to push that higher yes we
absolutely do I need to stabilize some
stuff
alright let's so let's push this up a
bit so if J has increased his score I
don't see it live on a 3d marks Hall of
Fame yet but it is slow to update and
we're not even plugged into Internet's
ours won't go up there either but you
know what let's well that's uh
understand some of this chat the thread
Ripper do well in three mark not as well
as like a 79 ad XE it's it's just
different it behaves differently it
likes frequency a lot alright so time to
get real here I guess mesh 1.38 we're
good everywhere else
let's do
33 on the mesh should be good let's push
48 here and memory will leave that the
same I don't change too much at once and
cause confusing issues I don't know
what's causing the crash so let's get
that going
apparently J is putting up a fight as
he's not streaming though I don't think
is he where that scores post in my
trailer today I don't know
rips lifespan yeah who cares it's just
over class I'm like I'm running it all
day not running it all day
okay so doubt some more super chats we
got Tim $5 for a deleted 7900 acts with
liquid metal and a 420 rad what is a
save 24-7 voltage I can get 4.9 with the
court 1.35 and 90 seen blender is that
okay 90 Celsius then that times I guess
that is a pretty high voltage demand on
your case - so V core it's more you'll
generally run into thermal issues before
you run into voltage safety issues but
uh 1.35 is fine
not any celsius is pretty high though if
I would feel more comfortable if that
were a bit lower so I don't know if you
resealed your processor this is I just
replied to an email today from someone
who who was working on a deal it and
they resealed their processor with j-b
weld which we also used to use but we
stopped because it creates an air gap
between the die and the IHS that
actually is worse for performance then
then just putting the IHS back on with
no seal if you really want to see
although you use like a I don't know
Loctite superglue or something like that
on just the corners and that should that
should improve things for you assuming
it's a seal issue like if yours if you
sealed it and it was too thick of a seal
like silicone adhesive that can
absolutely increase your temperatures a
lot just like you're saying even though
you're deleted so that would be a point
of consideration for me is redoing the
seal you can check your case airflow in
general what do we want to put forget
1,000 on this 1,000 here you can of
course lower your voltage if possible
like try and fine-tune it down a bit
1.25 fine it's just I don't like the
temperature that high alright let's so
let's let's max these fans here's what
I'm doing
just because you probably can't see this
too well because I did change the
resolution to everything fans 100% on
the EVGA XE ultra power 130 percent
which is maxed with a stock card 200 and
offset for the clock one
for the coat for the memory and then for
the modded card we're running let's put
that at 850 not a not 8500 850 for the
memory on our efi hybrid and this is our
weakest card it is not a very good
overclocker to do 160 here see if that's
stable I think it is now it's at that's
123 that's the maximum power offset fans
can stay at 42 because they're not doing
anything because it's liquid cooled and
let's do a full pass and see what
happens see how that goes this will be
our first full pass and quite some time
so 14th out of thanks Jacob
Jacob from EVGA has just alerted me to
say Vince is watching now you don't know
who Vince is so this is the expression I
got from Andrew behind the camera
Vince is aka kingpin Vince Lucy doe he's
joined us on camera a few times so he is
now here to judge me hey Vince come out
and join us sometime come on come kick
my ass and overclock and everyone can
learn something so Vince is is someone I
have great respect for his overclocking
abilities he's number one always just
like as a global constant in general so
he's he's apparently tinned in everyone
jab feel free to say hi to kingpin
himself I'm sure he had no pressure
right yeah yep that's not accurate
alright so we're running the Surrey 980
ax e what did I put it 248 things on 48
we this processor I've done before it's
doing a times by extreme pass right now
but I've done testing with the RIP Ltd
stream and that one we had issues at
about 49 X so we're gonna run into the
limitations of this process it pretty
soon I think
okay so what's what's chat saying to
events they want to know is Robo o'clock
or watching I don't know is it is it
like deep learning the are you like
feeding it the stream and dying it deep
learn that this is bad don't do this
because that would probably be good deep
information hey hey Kane been
overclocking my 660ti hah watching the
stream nice I'm not him but that's still
pretty cool that's a it's a good card to
work on get some extra life out of it
so one says wish him a happy birthday is
it his birthday actually I played yes if
it is then I guess we'll do that ok so
while this is running it's on I think
graphics test 2 right now let's see if
that's stable
we are currently set up with you know we
have a lot more people in the stream we
haven't gone over the components in a
little while let's do that so let's go
over the components while this is
running good time to do it anyway
originally I was considering using ice
like actual just ice and putting the
radiator in it we're gonna have some fan
noise in my mic sorry can't help it this
is blowing so if this radiator this fat
thermal take radiator is blowing so much
air in this direction Angie can we get a
are you able to zoom in on this and like
actually see it so if I'm not in the air
flow path yeah you'll see the ACS box
just slightly moving and that thing is
like I don't know 12 15 feet away and
that is from the air coming out of the
360 thermal take radiator which is
hooked up to our CPU so it's got a
stunad maglev fan on it at about 3000
rpm and this is the same supplier that
Corsair uses for their own maglev fans
we have right here I just only have one
of them though so that's 3000 rpm I'm
pretty fast loud and then we have a fat
radiator hooked up to the CPU of course
EVGA X 299 dark board which is in our
experience pretty warm now in our
experience with X 299 this is the best
overclocking board we've worked with so
that's got two fans on the vrm which
means I don't have to worry about them
at all I don't need another case fan
pointed at them Ram g.skill Trident Z
black it's 3600 Hertz for the XMP I
think seals out of 1617 something like
that and we're running at 4000 mega
Hertz right now we have a lot of fans so
I zip-tied sorry these are tweezers not
zip ties
keep getting that wrong we used we as
tweezers as the verge has updated us to
tie a deck of these fans called gentle
typhoon fan to the back side of the
bench that's blowing air over the left
half BRS my modded hybrid card if you
didn't see it in the video the hybrid
card has no heat sinks on it anymore
just a closed loop liquid cooler this be
quiet silent bass silently excuse me 280
so in order to keep the vrm and the
memory cool there are a lot of fans and
it's to full credit I mean like this
isn't the best way to measure but we
don't have a missive any issues because
it's a blackbody on there that's 31
degrees right now that the hottest
memory module is about 31 and when it's
running a hard test it gets like 50 so
we're good on cooling there 140 not so I
just pulled everything I had exhaust
here intake intake here going straight
onto the card
we've shorted the shots on the FE card
in the front liquid mod on it and a X
1600 I for the power supply because it
uses a lot of power so what's our score
here oh shoot come back over here we're
gonna have to run this again because you
weren't pointed at it I guess so the
score target and on applied tweezers
easy this was her night our goal to beat
is up until the point that kingpin
decides to just stop the fun for all of
us to stop being a good sport the goal
to beat it was fourteen thousand forty
three and we are at fourteen thousand
151 check that out so came Ben ready to
publish your his score right after you
beat Jay probably so I have heard that
Jay is still pushing clocks on his CPU
and I don't know if he's sandbagging I
don't know if he's gonna submit more
scores but we need to keep going so I
have I saw the secret weapon I still
have more in the tank we need to set a
higher score I'm not connected to the
Internet you're not going to see this
reflected on the scoreboard just yet but
we have to keep going because Jay is
still going his own Twitter feed
apparently according to you guys
how to score for a CPU of eleven
thousand seven fifty seven and we're at
11,000 374 and I don't know if he's
increased his graphics score but his is
already higher than ours we're at
fourteen seven eight nine here 14 151
total so a lot of our advantage is made
up in the cpu score difference where
it's a secret weapon a drum of three I'm
Novik fluid so two dollars from Mac true
no it is not that would be a good one so
Jays scores were fourteen thousand eight
eighty four for the graphics and we're
at fourteen seven eight and nine so he's
got a bit of about 100 point lead on us
there and that is really important in
times by extreme so I have to gain some
ground there CBO score he's at ten six
three eight we're at eleven three seven
four that's for his like most recent
score I have
I think he's increased that since then
according to chat so we got to push a
bit harder here haha so secret weapon is
kingpin and chat I mean that would be
nice wouldn't it that would that
wouldn't be fair gain Ben's got a just
crush both of us because I just it's
what he does on a Saturday I guess
alright so let me type I should do a say
one second I say this fourteen one five
one okay so let me type down these
scores just so I have them where are we
even right now we're at 48 X we have a 1
are we still at one point 3 volts are we
at one point 3 4 Negro at one point 3
volts 40 X 30 3 X mesh one point three
eight and four thousand for the memory
probably still see el 16 I think so some
room there 14 1 5 I'm taking a note of
the score so I know if we're going
backwards when I start changing other
things and 11 3 7 4 okay cool and that
is what the native resolution on the
monitor as well just in case and then
one was worried about that okay nice
well let's um I don't know let's let's
do some more some more bio stuff and
then we'll see if we can play around
with the cards a bit more so as I've
been noting throughout the stream I got
to check my messages I think Jacobs just
messaged me again as I've noted know
someone says oh damn Vince's bday
yesterday well having birthday events if
you're still watching so yes like I was
saying during throughout the stream
we've restocked the the mod mats are
back in now if you've wanted one they
are on store document access net you can
pick one up and we've also got the GN
tear down crystals back in there so
those are pretty sweet we gave a couple
of those out as awards but you know if
you don't make products and you want to
buy your way into having one we let you
do that you don't let the manufacturers
do that don't get any ideas
but that is on stored I can't reside on
that we have medium and large and we
also of course restocked the beer
glasses which is currently filled with
water
all right I missed the delete button
sorry I'll shoot
alright so 48 acts on the core I don't
think we can do too much more than that
we might even be able to hold 1.35 or
something on the mash I'm gonna take
this down 1.3 6 let's see if that holds
if we got a pool error we know what that
is I'll push that back up so shoot let's
do memory let's try like 15 15 15 28 32
28 1.65 and let's try that see if that
stable I need to change some of the
other sub times in there to actually
someone has sent me a screenshot of
kingpin saying ha ha ha and he's HipChat
is that actually hammer did someone just
registered to him here glass currently
filled with the thought liquid metal now
bad don't do not don't do that don't
fill these with the criminal or proceed
to drink them and also if you have that
much liquid metal you're a very wealthy
person but you should pick up one of
these if you intend to fill a glass with
liquid metal it might as well be yours
just don't drink it all right so we have
pushed the memory times a bit we've they
change anything else I think that's most
yeah mesh change the Masters voltage to
be a bit less abusive on it so we'll see
if that kills things
all right precision x1 got an update
today actually or I got an update today
anyway
1:30 that's the default power target and
max fan speed of course clock 200 I know
is stable we might be able to do more I
haven't tried since the rig Orwell
wasn't even rip Paul stream since since
Paul responded to us live in our last
stream I haven't tried to push this
further but maybe maybe we need it we
can this one I am fairly confident we're
at its limits but we could of course try
to push that if we had to so let's apply
that ok full pass here we go probably
straight start working towards that
secret weapon soon I don't know if it's
actually any good I'm filling it up a
lot for not knowing if it's gonna suck
CBO score was 11 7-6 7-4 J on one GPU ok
so I don't actually don't actually know
where that is or what CPU is using but
that's good to know
very good to know what thermal paste
goes under the gnq but on the light
stand
you uh you actually don't need their own
pace toward our thermal conductivity is
just that good we managed to make a
glass cube contacting a plastic LED base
highly thermally conductive secret
weapon is tight lithium crystals okay
what else we got super chats so quicker
tech this is at 7:42 p.m. I'm going to
try and catch up here five bucks about
the price divisions have you checked out
Hardware bots and their team Cup it's an
OC competition with specific hardware by
their what's using cut down so 79 80 XE
everyone knows at CPL using the OC
competition I have not checked that out
that sounds cool though I'm not checked
out their team cop hey it hasn't crashed
yet it's also not a CPU benchmark yet CX

Steve I love your work any tips for a
custom PC shop or youtube channel thank
you for your videos keep your Swiss Army
knife closed they come with zip ties
they're called tweezers any tips I mean
like the the biggest suggestions I can
give - we were talking about this the
other day I still cgn as a pretty small
youtube channel and outlet overall but
fact of the matter is it's not small I
would consider a medium now I guess but
um I still think of it that way and I
think of you keep that mentality and you
keep working on it like it's a small
project then there's a lot of it feels
more genuine and people really be
attracted to that and then as far as
like growing custom PC shop I don't know
if your try and find ways you can blend
in YouTube with your normal daily
functions at your PC shop like if you're
gonna build a system for a customer
anyway find a way to create a video out
of that on YouTube without slowing down
your process even if you know that might
just be like sub 2 cameras on tripods or
an overhead camera and edit it together
later try and spend a minimum amount of
time on it while still generating good
content while you start and then once
you start seeing traction it's time to
invest but obviously don't hamstring
your other business to try and get a
prospect going other tips I don't know
be very consistent make sure everyone
knows your upload schedule try and have
one stuff like that and also work hard
let's just play the biggest one
okay any other there's more super chasm
just scrolling back up to them that one
was like seven thirty something still
scrolling okay here we go
Shelby boost says five dollars thank you
very much Steve do you think NVIDIA is
throttling the r-tx cards via drivers
until time passes and more Pascal
overstock cards aw I don't think so
there there is legitimacy to some of the
conspiracy theories around this launch I
think but that one eye is one that I
don't think really holds water and video
held drivers from press for a long time
as Linus noted publicly till like Friday
before launch
specifically to tune them and try and
get more performance so this they would
release some sooner I think if that were
a concern I think Pascal overstock will
sell on its own regardless of the
drivers because it's pretty affordable
now and the new cards are very expensive
so I don't think they need to hamstring
themselves and like destroy their
launched reputation hurt their brand
credibility just to sell Pascal when
it's already selling on its own so no I
would say that's probably not not a one
of the conspiracy theories I believe in
NRG underscore or $2 thank you very much
energy to different cards with two
different OCS first to the same it's not
a question haha so different Oh Sees if
you have the patience for it this is
easy because one application but if
you're testing a whole bunch of games
you'll have to find the stablest common
denominator I guess for each card and
that's a lot of work so it might be
easier to do the same
lower overclock instead of to really
high over thoughts 14 137 CPA score
11,000 for 21 graphics 14 7 5 7 he's
still ahead of us in graphics so we got
to push that our previous score was 14 1
5 1 so 137 so that is down which is kind
of within variance though and we are
down in the graphics core Department but
up in the CPU score Department so that
is within variance let's start out let's
start playing around some more stuff
here so I have not tried this yet I
don't know what's gonna happen we worked
with the XOC community pretty closely
and fortunately the EXO Sikh community
was able to get us a custom view bios
and this card is only supposed to do 130
percent power target offset for the the
XE ultra I'm using right here but we can
go up to 154 I'm gonna put it to 140 I
don't know what kind of damage we're
gonna cause so we're gonna start at 140
I'll go past that later let's just let's
just do that and nothing else and just a
graphics test
and to save some time and see what
happens is this going to get us the
points we need to make sure we hold a
position over Jay when he submits his
allegedly newest scores according to
chat so it's it's 140 percent I have not
changed the clocks at all we're just
gonna see if that power increase gives
us more Headroom to run at a higher
clock so that is the secret weapon
imagine the coil line someone says yeah
well actually there's no coil line yet
and by that I mean if there is any
there's like 55 decibels of fans to my
right so I can't hear it that's the
solution to coil line
jay is GPUs were the MSI trio yeah so we
only have 28 only you have 20 ATS from
MSI 1 and 128 from gigabyte 20 a TFE and
then the T is I have 3 I've got founders
Edition which we modded and I'm using
because music for the stupidest reason
XC ultra and we have the asus strix card
which actually I have really high hopes
for but unfortunately bassist Rick's
card and this is an Nvidia problem not
an Asus problem is too tall so this is
the problem with the not the inflexible
bridges I could probably modify it to
make like just loosen the screws and
make it all wonky and make it fit I
guess but that do I have one these envy
link bridges are Hart bridges they they
will not conform to different size cards
very well so the easiest card is just
tall enough and both my other two cards
are reference size so unfortunately did
not reach the MSI card I have is not a
TI so that was no good either so yeah
bit sat on that because our Fe is pretty
weak compared to the XE ultra I think we
kind of won the silicon lottery on the
XC or lost it on the FE or something and
then the Aces card I have I have high
hopes for because it's a custom PCB
but the sizing just doesn't line up for
envy link unfortunately
once we get more cards in there we can
probably make it work late to the party
do they shunt mod the r-tx card one of
them we shunt modded the weakest of our
two cards the FE which is currently a
hybrid card it's got a liquid cooler on
it and it has enough air that the prm's
are and the let's check a memory module
hottest memory module I are reading is
about 57 degrees it's really good I
checked that with thermocouples earlier
it's too hard to sneak him in there now
with the fans but it was basically
validated we're plus or minus two
degrees from the IR eating so pretty
good on the temperatures but yes we did
shunt mod one card you should make a
custom PCB no I shouldn't
who has Kane been check the 3d mark Hall
of Fame it's number one all right so
this is running as that was that CPU
that was GPU - I think graphics to you
now was that CPU yes that was oh no we
just don't need graphics that's right
so I crashed so I did not survive that
pass let's just try it again sometimes
it works better on a second try and
let's just only do graphics - this time
save some time if it's unstable there it
would probably a memory stability issue
if so I think okay
all right so see if it see if it
survives
I want a GN designed case yeah I mean
that'd be pretty it'd be pretty cool but
we don't have any present plans shunt
mod results in better benchmark scores
yes by a couple hundred points it was
not a lot it was it was not a lot it was
like three or four hundred points I
think I need to put more liquid metal on
there to increase the resistance but not
to a point where it's gonna drop into 2d
clock so that's a problem and piggy back
in like a three milli ohm shunt resistor
on it might be a better option or
something like that
okay so a lot of people in chat hanging
out so we beat J's score that I had most
recently seen but apparently he's been
posting higher sea view scores than his
recent submitted score so that means we
need to keep pushing a bit more to try
and hold that lead while we can and
can't been joined earlier for a bit on
if he's still watching but he will I'm
sure soon posts his own scores to be two
hours at least for making it interesting
for him so running another test hasn't
crashed yet and like I have been saying
if you go to store to gamers Nexus net
you can pick up one of our Gian beer
glasses the cobalt color with the gold
rim they are back in the stock and
shipping now they were weather delayed
for a couple days there but they're in
that and we're gonna have a chime beep
in a second I think so yeah and then you
can pick up the mod Matt of course on
the store as well a store died Kendra's
access net for the mod Maps they just
got in today and they are shipping so
he's been waiting for one they're here
alright that passed so now we just need
to like to actually get them both to
pass the one that crashed last time
didn't succeed this time
okay see like both pass we pushed the
power target beyond what is natively
supported anything else you guys have
been doing is get better scores than
during the last livestream once you're
cooling a submission the power is Max
and the shunt mod has done what more can
you do the bios mods we worked with xoc
community get a view bios custom view
bios hasn't worked yet but we'll see you
could do better overclocking than we did
last dream we switch to a 79 80 XE next
to 99 that was a big upgrade stuff like
that all right
so super chats what's what's in here got
a scroll up for a bit I think so we got
got the ubiquitous crushed J comments I
don't know how long that will last he's
apparently posting high scores oh now
I'll get to this one moment I guess
someone's eyes got fantastic yes we are
still doing that I'll get to that in a
moment I'm trying to scroll up to the
latest to the last question there it is
okay so last question I saw was from
energy the Kenneth e on $5 asked when
are you collaborating with the Verge's
computer expert for his technical
expertise I actually towards the that
video originally going up I there we go
finally got a blue screen the first time
all night bad pool collar I'm thinking
we need more V mesh potentially to
answer the question though yes this
typically that's going to be a in my
experience with this bench from UV mesh
voltage limitation I did tweet and say
like they're welcome to join us if they
wanted to or something but that time has
passed as as the Internet has devolved
into just making fun of the content the
next question was crack on PC HK a 25
rip J and rip Paul is the CPU 28 course
and 5 gigahertz nope sadly not and there
is no secret chiller under the table
either
although I did want to put it under ice
but it would be very public and obvious
let's just try us go back up to one
point no or not eight not eight bolts
one point three eight I just wanted to
hold with that power offset that's all I
want
okay the Lee SEK 100 gamers Nexus
deserves a ton more subs than the
current number Wow all right
no bowl no sugarcoating beast and I
believe pretty much all tech channels
could learn from you never change the
hair we learned a lot from all the other
tack channels here so it is a it's it's
a good community where we can kind of
there's problem with technology with
computers is it's impossible know
everything about them and we can only
cover so much at any given time and so
we learn a lot from the other folks too
because some a lot of them cover stuff
we don't so everyone can learn from
everyone in this community which is why
for example I think Linus's channel
despite what I know a lot of you think
of the channel overall does provide a
pretty good service to the community in
that it brings in new viewers who don't
know anything about any of this stuff
and they eventually kind of graduate on
or spread out and watch other channels
and stuff to you so he's got a big value
out there too but thank you very much
for the comment 122 percent so clock 160
offset I think that's all this damn card
can do 850 on the memory big limitation
there as well apply benchmarks times by
extreme run okay
I can feel the air coming off of that
bench it it burns when Internet Protocol
has opposed today five tire
super chat thanks very much next
overclocking stream show off the glass
by doing a shot of some kind of alcohol
every time you make a benchmark run
would be fun for all not much
competent benchmarking would get done by
the end of it jeg on twelve two dollars
I really like your hair what kind of
shampoo do you use well actually let me
uh let me locate the tub of it what I
use is stored in another room for safety
here's what I use that right there that
is a jar of ASA tech stock thermal
compound four watts per meter Kelvin
only the best and that is what I use
probably don't do that still running the
benchmark chrome an MX fifty given the
power limitation on the twenty series
what are your thoughts on the 1805 chip
28 ET i from Galax eighteen hundred
dollars it's hard in for extreme
overclockers i don't know anything about
it but if it bypasses some of the
overclocking limitations I guess there's
a market for it and XO Sears might pay
for it but I'm being told I'm being told
by the way that's Vincent chat so
apparently they're the real one isn't
there I'm gonna look at chat now Vince
Vince I'm watching I'm judging your
youtube comment quality as you are
judging my overclocked quality Tim no it
is not liking that that bias I don't
think whatever that's 254 something
happen to that let's see what happens if
we do that 10/10 KP and 980 TI question
mark I think so I was a response to
someone a house yeah I don't know if so
if Vince is in chat let's throw that
last Super chat question to him look out
for kingpin I guess kingpin the question
for you from super chat was given the
power limitation oh it's about a
competitor you can't really answer that
I guess but let's just pretend you know
$1,800 card it's by Galax but let's just
pretend you know maybe even GA makes one
something like that what what's sort of
the target market for those cards
obviously it's extremely overclockers
but how much do you personally gain from
those versus if you use like a reference
card for example like if you're posting
scores on times by I want to know if you
kingpin go and post a score with two
reference cards with whatever mod you
can do versus your own kingpin card
what's the advantage I think I can
summarize Savas answer for when i
previously asked in this and i believe
the answer was that a lot of the really
hard work that goes into hard body in
the cards like doing actual hardware
mods to them is eliminated with those
xoc cards whether that's Galax or the
kingpin cards or whatever it doesn't
matter which band a lot of the hard work
is done for you so I think that's kind
of the idea is it really simplifies the
process of getting it up and running man
this is not happy with that so let's
let's dial that back I guess maybe what
if we do one you know what I found
something with the shunt mod on the FE
that if I when I when I did the shunt
mod I had to drop the clock offset
because it was boosting higher natively
from the shut mod so let's try droppin
the offset on the click on the core and
keeping the power target high and see if
that same philosophy applies here I
might have to drop it a few times right
180 now down from 200 so the question
will be does our score overall
go up from this instead of down I think
that might be what's going on here
someone says kingpin is google searching
an answer right now
what is 20 atti kingpin 20 atti
benchmarks is 20 80 TI any good come
back with an answer Steve do you think
we'll see true next-gen GPUs next year
with seven animator I think we will see
I don't want to be 7 but I do think
we'll see another GP launch mine video
next year that is not the 20 well not
the current 20 series I hope maybe
quarter for quarter one of the following
year I'm not sure I honestly don't know
I'm just kind of going off of I don't
know
gut instinct I guess okay questions
$2.00 from X 18 eights could you produce
a clear glass with a logo yeah I mean so
we've got this one it's the cobalt glass
with the gold rim and the logo what logo
do you want on a clear glass and what
kind of glass this is the pint glass it
is on store document access dotnet if
you want to pick it up we have discounts
for packs of two and four but I haven't
seen too many requests for clear we can
certainly do it those there's interest
in it but let me know what changes you'd
like to see like if you want a different
design for the glass itself I'll keep an
eye on chat to you for this still
running attacks hasn't died this time so
maybe the instinct is right here Danberg
five dollars starting a new build gaming
focus sin crash should I save money out
in CPU to buy a better GPU leaning
towards the AMD I don't know your budget
unfortunately should I save money on the
CPU to buy a better GPU that is a hard
question always so I don't know like it
I don't know your budget but the which
changes everything
but the r5 for example is sort of our
go-to in its price category like the
2600 you can get an r5 2600 really good
CPU if you are leaning towards AMD that
is absolutely a good buy and it is
perfectly fine for gaming
and it would free up some budget for
other things so I don't know your budget
but if you're kind of like you're not
quite an i7 r7 territory and you're
looking at Intel or AMD and r5 high
territory
I'd say go r5 2600 and there are times I
would go Intel but it's primarily for
the high-end or well the high-end these
days I sevens for specifically only
gaming bills where you want like a 144
refresh or something like that but
you're talking about leaning towards
Andy saving some money on the CPU r5
2600 sounds like a great choice for that
and then GPUs are good right now if you
get 10 serious prices are good Vega 56
like I said the stream sponsor the
advertiser is in the link but rx5 ATS
Vega 56 finally coming down in price
finally so I really liked making 56 when
it came out it was a lot of fun to work
with like it's easy to overclock easy to
mod you can do it does have BIOS
limitations but you still flash the BIOS
you can still do like power table mods
in the registry so a lot of fun to just
hack around with it survives guys so it
made it this time
finally fourteen eight four seven okay
so what we have learned here is a
someone's oh is did kingpin tweet at me
or something someone said what we have
learned is that the power offset this is
what I learned with the shunt mod to the
power offset was helping push the clocks
higher on their own and then the clock
ops that was then too high so I dropped
like frequency offset and now we're
getting higher scores because the
boosting Headroom is natively higher
with a 154 percent power target that is
pretty cool to learn same concept
applies with the shunt mod where you
take a shunt resistor and apply liquid
metal to it which of course be careful
doing that it could fall off but
fourteen thousand eight forty seven is
our graphics core fourteen eighty four
seven what is J's where is Jai standing
J 14 884 what am i fourteen eighty four
seven okay fourteen eight eight four we
did already officially beat his total
score
but I'm concerned I'm worried because I
know J I'd have a J's over there
probably right now feeding an
air-conditioner into his computer via a
cardboard box the one that he lives in
so J I don't want you to damage your
house any further to keep damaging your
cardboard box I know it took you a long
time to save up for that and so we're
gonna try and get an extra lead here
before we call it for the streaming
because I don't want to end the stream
and then Jays just like whoop there's my
score beats yours because I would suck
so we got a we got a make it a bit of a
competition ha ha ha so the chats going
crazy right so let me take a note of
this shots fired
thinking of the score so I know what it
is 14 847 okay and that is with +1 54%
on the XZ ultra and then with a 180
offset on the core so that is our big
change so I think we need to do a full
run now now that I know how to get it
stable we got a new score so I can keep
that in case we need to submit it
before before I like blow a board and we
can't ever come back this way so let's
just run a full pass just to get it done
in case something dies just fired
burning his cardboard house down or
thirst alright
what keyboard are you using so this is
what is this z10 is that what it's
called
Jakub EVGA z10 and I like the keyboard
well enough so here's my criticism for
this keyboard we got a couple of these
from EVGA for the office and we are
using them for production systems
however there are some things I would
change the switches are fine there
these are Browns I like them because
they're quiet enough that on stream it's
not like blasting the mic with clicky
noises but this drives me crazy so this
function button over here this button
should be switched with the windows
button in fact the function button on
this keyboard is only used for things
that the dedicated media buttons can
already do so there's no reason for this
button to
exist on this keyboard I think it might
be able to profile switching to but you
could add a hard button for that so I
use the Windows key lot like Windows II
I use all time windows D all the hotkeys
and having it on the other side drives
me crazy there is - EB J's credit in the
software there is actually a button to
swap the functions of those two
unfortunately the keys are different
sizes so you can swap the functions but
you can't swap the literal function key
with the Windows key I do like the
keyboard though it's just that one thing
fortunately they do have a button to fix
it in software but that drives me crazy
so EVGA if you're listening it's a great
keyboard overall build quality is good
it's just these two buttons need to be
switched or remove the function button
it doesn't really seem to do much
because the media keys do all the stuff
that does I don't know there might be a
profile switch like I said but oh you
know what there's this is kind of like a
silly dumb feature that's actually kind
of cool though
so you ready ready for this
BAM spring-loaded feet no it's it's fine
like it's I have no problem with it
other than that for the most part there
is one other thing actually well I'm
well I'm here jacob says he got it z10
is the name of it so I do like the
keyboard overall just be clear it's just
yeah like I said that one thing there is
one other thing and it's it's a shame
because it's a cool feature but the
volume on this keyboard is a slider and
the problem with this is if you change
output devices like from speakers to
headphones it no longer applies to that
device like it well it will work to
adjust the device but if we have this at
like 30% volume on the keyboard but the
device when I switched to it was that
50% volume they're not adjusting in sync
so it's a really cool idea just that
feature doesn't play out as it should
wouldn't switching devices or if you
change the volume in Windows but not on
the keyboard that Hardware switch isn't
gonna move so that's problem to you so
maybe just go to a roller I know it's
what everyone does but there's a reason
for
CPU test hasn't crashed yet has not
crashed kingpin Steve you have your work
cut out for you man I'm looking at the
chat why does everyone want me to look
at the chat the Jay post the record or
something I guess Oh Jay with the shots
fired convinced Eddie ever work cut out
for you which i think means Jay posted
something
it is the real kingpin I think he made a
thing specifically for this didn't Jay
post something I don't see it on the
Hall of Fame yet that he posted in chat
or why I'm trying to keep an eye on
everything that wants Jay hey Steve I'm
currently at home with my new score safe
and sound not uploaded yet you're safe
that's my arse hasn't uploaded either
cool that's funny hey Jay we've been
sending people your way all night but
now now I will have to take that back we
can no longer recommend your Channel
you only recommend it if your score is
lower than mine all right
chad is just trolling you know I don't
think they are I believe that I believe
that J I mean he apparently posted an
eleven thousand something CPU scores so
he boosted a lot of her previously
kingpin says I'm benching with J what
that's how is that fair how on earth is
that fair Banshee off J let me go let me
give Roman a call and get their bauer
out here have one confident person on my
team fourteen to one nine
so apparently J is cheating and this
proxy overclocked hand through kingpin
[Laughter]
get builds right yeah we can do that
here let's go let's get all Matt get all
the boys out kept their Bower get get
build Zoid get the crew together all
right Steve cop there Bowery yeah we got
a damn cop to the verge has the high
score it out the verge doesn't have the
high score okay so what what what's what
am I even doing our score is 14 to 1 9
we're a good bit of a good bit ahead 14
to a 9 and this one's in the wrong spot
and then uh 14 8 6 - that's good
11:41 you know I wanted to that's the
same exact scores last time that's
consistent I wanted to be careful how
long we went on this but if if J is
proxy overclocking through kingpin I
don't have to push a bit harder I think
I'm not gonna use that one to you so did
he beat your offline score Jay I don't
know if Jays still and chat everyone's
got to help me here and like keep an eye
on chat because I can't see all of it
I'm trying do that I don't know watch
chat for a minute just to see if Jay
responds
the owner who jr. there is I'm not no
idea why Vince said that I think he's
Charlie in here I don't know who to
believe on one hand the Vince says he's
joking now I don't believe you now I
know Vince is a Vince's this is a bit of
a trickster I've never seen I'm so
excited I'll as when he has been over
clocking his Roebuck Locker and at
Computex and Vince I want you to know we
still quote you when I was standing
behind the desk while he was working I
was gonna say poor Ian L&amp;amp;T we don't do
that anymore while he was retired
watching his creation do all the work
for him it would occasionally blue
screen and cane pin would say I don't
know my head she's done ski she's done
ski Steve he run around the table
changed something come back and it would
work again so Vince you have left a
lasting impression on us we constantly
quote your she's done ski I think he
thought it was dead after like eight
hours of non-stop
L&amp;amp;T which is a reasonable guess Jay says
that he's not getting outside help so
you know I'm gonna believe Jay for now
he says he's not man I hope believed Jay
you can check Jay out Jays two cents on
YouTube
his name is not Jay stood to race that
is not his name Jays to census is his
name yes I will beat the offline score
okay well let's restart I guess 14 two
one nine I better save that just in case
we're never back here so that I can at
least take second place apparently
let's see the question is when kingpin
said you have your work cut out for you
was he biessing me like he was with the
other stuff he said 190s try that let's
I think this will crash we're gonna try
170 190 on those core offsets and let's
launch 3dmark so while that's launching
as I've been saying the store has the
mod mats in stock now it's got the key
chains we just restocked the sticker
decals as well super high quality decals
and and we have the beer glass so you go
to store dock gaming taxes net to pick
up any of that stuff to support us
directly we very much appreciate it
all right let's launch that see that
does you know J if you're still there he
is he says I do love this battle that
hello go higher Steve ya know it's it's
a lot of fun actually
pimping and chat is hilarious right now
yeah a lot of fun so J thank you very
much for responding and giving me
someone to do overclocks with because
linus not only turned it down ran and
cowered his entire team did do Alex the
great ish
I think his youtube or his Twitter
handle is works for Linus he actually he
had some cool ideas for responding to
our score and beating it but I don't
think they came to fruition just because
the r-tx launched so open invitation
Alex if you want to come back with our
TX launch with your idea you told me
about that and that'd be cool but
otherwise I guess Jays the only one who
wants to play so Paul Paul was having
fun with us to you though so Paul pushed
some pretty good single card scores
earlier
rip LTTE popping up in chat
oh yeah Linus did do the the 4gb 100
build which didn't score too well
go figure Quadro cards alright so yeah
this is a this is pretty fun pretty fun
battle going with J right now mr. mr.
two cents himself the water cooling
expert he did a more
professional-looking version of the
hybrid model I did wear and I bought
machine screws from Lowe's and then
screwed a water blob CLC block onto it J
actually put it I don't know was what is
it J was it a supremacy Evo or something
put an ek block on it I think we noticed
this to promise the Evo would fit but I
only have one so I added user on the CPU
all right and now they're asking me the
push Malone build- tried but $40,000
cannot keep skills ooh ouch to be fair
that that build was not really built for
for the 3d mark 30fps yeah so J says
Steve we got a 79 13 single card times
by extreme score nice very nice I have
not done a single card tests for a
little while now so we'll have to
revisit that at some point perhaps once
my o
single card I can use the Aces one for
that that'd be good we put a water block
on the Asus card do single card test and
I haven't worked with the Asus one
because we're working waiting for BIOS
updates alright so that's still running
and I gotta take a note of Jays score so
I know what I'm trying to beat later 79
13 I think it was so I'll keep that in
mind for later 79 13 alright so let me
get a couple stupid chats coalition
gaming two dollars cuz the EVGA e power
device help with your goal I don't know
haven't used it before probably invite
my bids $5 my 7940 has half it scores
run 10 to 20 degrees hotter than the
others do you let a direct I'm out you
just tell them first now on pay is still
the same bad chip probably remove the
silicon adhesive that's on there and and
then go from there
like remove it all redo your application
make sure it's yes that crashed in the
second test so that was what they 170 on
what the first card and 190 on this one
so let's go down to 160 let's just
figure out which card is causing the
crash in and that was in graphics too
okay no CPU test okay graphics see if
that crashes again with the ten
megahertz reduction yeah remove your
silicon adhesive redo it it's probably
created an air gap causing the Delta
between cores okay kingpins real name is
dope AF yes Mac drew forty-one hey Steve
my new MacBook Pro keeps thermal
throttling when web browsing should I go
to Apple and consult a genius or just
missing with you yeah definitely don't
bother um
NZ I didn't five dollars why is it that
CPUs oh wait what's he saying J J's
posting something everyone stop
what's scrolling up J put up a nice
single FSU I haven't gone far astray
culture yet on this jasa are you saying
RTX doesn't stock the prices I would
agree that the price definitely sucks in
comparison to what we're used to
well and in comparison what you get
there's no r-tx yet but maybe we'll
really visit once games actually use the
features and didn't why is it that CVS
has to be OCD iOS versus GPU OCS also
the G on mugs are great quality thank
you giving me an opportunity to pluck
them we have the bug back here so next
to me the snowflakes stand in that
patreon backers gave us an the midnight
standing because snowflake can't be near
the streams she will destroy all of the
components but yeah the mug is in stock
and available on stored at gamers X's
Donna anyway your question so you can OC
CPUs in software it's just it's not
really great kind of sucks to do but
there's a lot more options for CPUs
there's lower level options some stuff
doesn't need to be enumerated at boot
and you could do that stuff in software
but then you'd have to reboot anyway so
there's a couple notes for you did it
did it pass no so okay so we can't push
that frequency on the EVGA card so
that's got to come back down to 180 so
we're stuck at 180 there so
there's gonna be kind of slow going for
a second guys while I'm finding the
stable clocks for each card at the high
end because we're tending revisiting
these and then I'm gonna push memory so
we couldn't go any higher on the EVGA
card for core but maybe for memory when
can we buy snowflake plushies from the
store I actually have some ideas on that
and I will revisit it once we're ready I
do have some ideas though involving like
giving part of it to a charity for like
cat shelter or something like that let's
see next one evoke re productions $10 is
a fantastic sell on the menu hoping you
test ml 120 fans and jet flow flat fans
I want to see which of these if the
specs are true and which is objectively
better yes I just got my fan testing PCB
back from the engineer who was helping
me fix it and it's all fixed it works
now so we can actually start doing that
it was a was an issue on the PCB so I
couldn't actually make any progress on
it until that was fixed what is this
what what notifications am I getting Oh
Jay this is ten minutes ago Jay texted
me and said that's not true kingpin
isn't helping me so I'm gonna believe
you Jay I don't believe you and Jacob
from EVGA says you can launch small
things off the feet of the keyboard I
guess is that what you do man now that
you're a pro streamer for EVGA that you
just do you find small objects and
launch them where's a screw you just
just screw
we have a few screws here
let's draw them one of the video cards
let's take one that's replaceable we
don't need that one
okay this is not the right angle for
this Andrews covering his eyes oh my
gosh it actually does launch it I'm glad
I chose oh there it is
let's just it hit the ceiling or the
light or something
nice well if you needed a reason to use
that feature there you go
anybody have the best yeah that's a good
point that would have been pretty bad no
hey so we're still running we're finding
a stable clock here Ryan from our teams
those new markets here y'all Street he
BGA's d2
all right so I'm shocked that you found
that screw so quickly you have me today
I thought I was gone someone in chat
says I work with Jacob he literally
launches stuff with the keyboard feet
okay so it's real it's real
so yeah fantastic so on the menu like I
said just survive crash graphics - okay
so we can't push these further we can
stop wasting time with that now so we're
stuck at 160 offset on card 1 stuck at
180 on card - let's try memory I don't
know let's try like a thousand ten
that's such a small gain at this point
let's try like a thousand 15 maybe apply
see if it insta crashes
and not expecting stability we might
have to go to CP you're out or a chiller
C T mu Kynan n dude are still waiting
for the hair bounce kid yes that is a
high demand it's backordered for a long
time
EVGA puts up a new marketing video soon
launch it like tech Jesus the Martin C
one two three five quid have you modded
the GB voltage controllers a secret Evan
no that was the man we're an hour behind
on these super chats sorry that was the
the V BIOS Max Robbins two dollars will
he make body pillows no no NaCl with the
knife
Canadian ten dollars thank you very much
here's five here's five Canadian repulse
keep up the live streams I question as I
am also a fellow with long hair what do
you use that shampoo conditioner I
already answered that it's this top of
thermal paste mod 989 five dollars do we
know if core clock speed affects
ray-tracing ops or tensor core so a 10%
boost in core clock maybe boost rate
range might understand I don't know that
is a great question
technically they're all housed within
the SMS but I don't I don't know how it
interacts because we don't have anything
we can actually test other than those
tech demos so I don't know well once
they give me something to test we can
look into it I really want to we've had
that question a lot in the last few days
on the comments and videos it's a great
question I have it too but I don't know
I can ask on video see if they'll
respond Matamata lee five dollars online
fury Triax vs RX 580 at 1080 or 1440p
what's the question is the question
which one's better I don't know I
haven't tested the fury axonal you know
what the fury Triax except the non acts
I haven't tested the fury I haven't
tested the fury X in a long time either
so I honestly you'd have to check one of
our own charts because like I make the
charts and I don't memorize all that
data so I'm sure we have an answer in
one of our charts but it's been a while
jmr 1969 X $5 one crush J to medium on
that's when I got that one earlier
three using a 2600 K wait for 10
nanometers or go 9900 K I don't know we
don't know the performance of the 9900 K
yet so if you're happy with the 2600 K
and it's not like holding you back and
maybe you don't use it professionally
then just stick with it man there's no
reason to move on
Thomas Boone yeah it's five canadian i
postulate you are not wearing pants do
you have a counter-argument yes it is
that I am wearing pants
air attack that's a fifty Norwegian I
think secret weapon using snowflake to
cool down the gpus snowflake to destroy
the GPS did it survive huh no okay it's
not surviving graphics test too as
expected I think this goes like 1005 but
there's really no point in getting five
extra megahertz actually there is let's
do it
thousand five okay sure why not let's do
that and then you know Jacob if you're
still watching to your profile save and
survive reboots because I haven't seems
like they don't survive reboots 850 is
where we're stuck there I think we can
maybe try 860 let's try it let's just go
up five on one ten on the other it
doesn't survive then I'm gonna have to
play around with the CPU more I guess
and the memory we can do a lot with
memory actually we do a ton with memory
J is sleeping with the fishes J
apparently has a higher score than us
just it's offline Oh insta crash nice
okay so those memory clocks aren't
stable let's let's work on the system
memory instead
night everyone my phone is like 800
degrees Celsius great stream thanks for
watching sorry about your phone
Steve Jane kingpin responded to you I
yes I unless you're talking about
something else I think I saw that though
King Ben says memory you can do a lot
with yeah
I also have an updated the BIOS on this
and quite a while so did GN rip J
already technically we have a higher
score offline than his online score but
he says he has a higher offline score
than our high score
so yes ish kingpin commented on memory
settings Oh what did what what was it
I'm scrolling up someone quoted if you
have it I'll scroll back down and look
for it in a moment
Cain been counted on memory settings hey
Steve I'm about to log off you may be
Tech Jesus but remember I untucked you
this night J's Tuesday hands well done
Jay don't get too cold in your cardboard
box you live in Jay is still leader in
times of ice cream yes this is awful I'm
not uploading things tenpin Steve you
need to select the right memory
frequency there are steps or delta
clocks that need to be dialed in for
best scoring okay do you mean the GPU
memory frequency
is that what you mean I'm scrolling back
down all the way down not necessarily
the highest got it okay interesting and
thank you to those of you who pasted
that for me
not necessarily the highest I follow you
let's try well before we screw around
with anything let's try drop in the
memory of it and see if a score goes up
because I've seen that in the past and I
guess if that's what uh that's what
you're talking about that would make
sense
zdg says I miss Osie TVs so much are
they not do they not go alive anymore
Judas was the better sinner priest is
pretty good
all right so kingpin says there are
sweet spots for memory all right well
let's let's play around with it I guess
see if we can figure out if it needs to
be lower instead of just the highest
which is what I was going for
God God is helping Jesus all right it
needs to put in tantalum caps trust me
the voltage I'm not going to heart mod
it the lower ambient temperatures making
difference right what you're trying to
do Ryan $10 yes absolutely it makes a
pretty big difference so and if King to
enforce anything I'm gonna miss it right
now but ambien GPU clocks as far as I
know that Titan V responds to clock
changes all the way down to like 28
there's sorry temperature changes all
the way down to 28 C or something
so yes lower temperature helps a lot
that's why we were considering an ice
bucket to begin this all right offset
that max fan speed let's just hit apply
before during memory and so we were
doing a thousand let's just try like I
don't know 950 or something and see what
happens
okay
what's your opinion on the Polaris
refresh rumors I think AMD needs to do
literally anything at this point because
they have a big opening right now with
Nvidia's kind of lost favor clock 160
power 123 we're sticking to 850 on
memory there and we're gonna drop to
like what I say let's drop to like 950
on this one and see if it's better
kingpin says they all do the core clock
does as well I think that must be in
response to the temperature question
okay so
let's see let's see if it's better with
lower target frequencies on the memory
I've seen it before
time supply a tricky she probably just
be running like graphics test two or
something I think but it does help to
have an actual score output all right
Dave five dollars when is the raglan zip
hoodie coming back in stock medium and
large sizes are both out of stock I just
placed an order last week and I think I
got billed for them yesterday so that
means they're probably on the way so
within about a week I think is when
they'll be back okay I'm gonna check
super chat for a minute we'll see if
this score is any higher than previously
with the lower clocks okay please show
the hardware set up for new viewers yes
we'll do that in a moment give me one
moment we'll show the hardware again
kingpin says let me help Jay get another
score be right back
damn it Vince it's gonna fly over from
Taiwan to California to help Jay for an
hour fly back come back in when he sees
I beat the score how is that fair just
got here what's the highest score so far
our highest score so far is 14000 219
total Jays online score is 14000 43 so
we're in first Jay says he beat that
score
so he's in first when he uploads it I
haven't uploaded ours either
was that not stable that's weird
so that's that's where we stand right
now with the scores you know there's a
like a bug here something - I don't know
if Jacobs still watching but precision
for whatever reason will drop the power
target from 123 to 122 if I click to the
other video card but if I stay on this
one it stays 123 I want that one percent
I don't know if it's doing anything but
drop that 800 I think our scores will go
down at this point I need to come back
to this tab now to increase the power
target again because it's gonna bug down
try 980 yep 122 okay just run that again
what did it fail graphics one or two
graphics one okay so will run both
kingpin in chat has told us to dial in
the memory and not just go for the
highest memory offset but dial it in to
find the most the best score I guess
it's done in increments or something and
he also says we have a special board
coming soon which I think I know it
thing I know about that one alright did
I miss anything else in chat it's gonna
run it run another benchmark see if it
survives I want to get higher than
14,000 219 I guess we do system memory
but I I think I do need to dial in the
video memory more from what cane what KP
was saying okay so questions we had I
got all this got that one trying to
catch up on the Super chats and there
are a lot of them there's the weird body
pillow one there's the are behind fury
one okay so here it is
can you T pose for 10 seconds $10 this
happens every stream now I'm not going
to tipo is that's weird
3ds 3ds scan or something to an a but I
didn't a pose last time get that one
okay
Ezekiel Alfonso a hundred ARS thank you
very much no message with that but thank
you nonetheless autumn bones 94 or $5
Miocene 1080i hybrid is stable at 28
megahertz temps are fine I'm hitting the
power limit should I look into doing a
shunt mod I guess like it's the per mile
with the chunk mods is if you're not
doing this then it doesn't feel like
there's a lot of point like it's not
really worth it if you're just trying to
game so if you're competitively
overclocking then yeah and maybe look
into like doing a piggyback shunt
resistor on top of it instead of liquid
metal for its little good metal is
difficult to work with for these because
like if you apply too much then you get
2d clocks you don't apply enough it
doesn't do anything there's no really
easy way to tell if it's gonna work or
not
so I wouldn't generally recommend it
unless you're like competing or
something and trying to keep an eye on
all chats and it's difficult kingpin
saying this one is different than all
previous versions or all previous
motherboards I guess and you're really
building that board Hough you should fly
out here with it bring it out do it over
yeah that's what we should do
there's your there's your overclocked
hook tied in with the new board bring it
out with a CPU and we can do some kind
of a scene on it it's frozen or did it
pass I think it's died nope let that bad
pool collar be mashed or something
someone says his name must be on it like
kingpin name I guess I bet Donna came
for the motherboard you can ignore it
chat for the next five minutes mostly
just screaming tipos Oh kingpin says the
KP bored kV card is the one that they're
doing different I guess not the
motherboard
alright so that crashed I want to try
and get some more out of the CPU to Mao
rebooting I think I can get no I think I
can get away with a couple cores at 49
maybe hmm
and let's you know what let's do memory
first let's do 48 on the cores memory oh
it's stable 15 I think I got this down
to 26 I did once before I have an old
profile let me load an old profile from
the rip Ltd stream and see what I did
for memory there and I'm gonna work
backwards from that I worked with builds
wait on this profile previously so 48
when I checked the main page again 33
that's good 1.95 good 0.38 1.33 files do
1.2 for we have more cooling this time
last time that is kind of high oh
whatever
let's do it okay
so I don't know if this is still stable
or not I don't know if we've had any
degradation of components but we will
find out oh no it's not an ad 86 K yeah
I know the Windows boot screen says that
it's because I cloned the drive it's a
it's a 79 80 XE is the CPU okay
someone says Alex West 10 allows the
stream inspired me to push my gaming
laptop of 3dmark I'm at 14 29 hashtag
rich and nice oh it's in legacy mode I
don't know if I've I guess I have run 3d
mark on laptops been a while some of
them we're pretty impressive it's always
a thermal issue with those though trying
to think of the best cooling I've seen
on a laptop and I'm having trouble
coming up with an answer I guess the
biggest ones by nature being bigger were
superior generally all right boot needs
to be UEFI it's not like I see anymore
Nordic gapper $10 hey Steve loved the
content you guys create big thanks to
you and the rest of the GaN team for
working hard thank you for the support
Ezequiel Afonso hey one question
considering the massive improvements
that the 10 series was in 2016 10 Saudi
beating the og Titan X and the 20 atti
having the same performance at the Titan
B what do you think I talked about on
the reviews but yeah okay so these are
not stable anymore what do I think I
think the price is just not there like
if if the games actually had r-tx
features it would be easier to justify
spending a lot of money for cool new
stuff but you're buying cool new stuff
that you can't use so yeah not not a not
a big fan of the prices TRF ii should be
a lot lower attendances
doing a OSU tournament with build Zoid
in their power against kingpin maybe if
I'm like the announcer or something it's
no reason for me to get in on that I
don't remember what our problem was with
stability on this last time What did he
say should be lower not so important for
graphics yeah graphics is uh is the weak
spot anyway
for fire strike you need to work on
those yeah definitely revive strike see
RFC they're saying should be lower I
don't I think we had trouble when I
tried like 240 or something is what I
tried last time I don't think this is
where this is where I always get stuck
I don't know why exactly crash because I
changed everything all at once so that's
always kind of sucky but let's let's put
that back up the top 28 I think I was at
28 last time let's just see if that
doesn't anything and then I had T RFC at
240 he must be nearing 230 watch the CP
you know a lot more than that a lot more
when it's running okay
I don't know whatever let's just have 10
and see what it does this is that this
is where I am limited by experience with
memory overclocking so we're gonna kind
of continue 14 14 14 no actually I've
tried that I worked with builds right on
that for the last stream for the repel
TT stream and 14 did not hold for us we
had to go we had to go to 15 we did 15
15 15 26 successfully the kid I have is
like a G skill tried and see you know I
said go over the components hey it's
booting this time it's in like that 26 I
think I'm not confident in the stability
of this I don't know if it's gonna make
it I made it to Windows okay so how do
we go over the components again I'll let
Andrew reposition while I trained all
right we'll go over the components see
RFC yeah I saw that
okay so parts for the people asking what
we're using we have a next to 99 dark
board which a lot of this the core
components what we use for the repel TT
stream so 299 dark G school tried NZ
which is 4,000 megahertz currently at a
CL 15 and then we have a 790 DX e under
a water block this is 2016 supremacy
block we have 360 rad thermaltake
radiator really fat one with two maglev
fans from Corsair we have a soon on fan
that I bought on there it's super high
rpm anak to a fan for exhaust up here
gentle typhoon fan on the back for in
take over the vrm knock to a fan in the
front for intake on to the vram and the
vrm of the modded card
be quiet silent loop 280 that I hooked
up to a an EFI card and then an ax 1600
I for the PSU some SSDs in a pan
controller I think that covers all of it
okay
41:33 is pot 12/12/12 28 is possible in
the dark I mean yeah but I worked with
builds right on that stuff before and I
don't think we ever got this memory down
there get some like team memory or
something
depends needs to send you Alton two pots
yeah tear a few weights you loose see
Ruffy if I I think it's supposed to be a
bigger number
what are their profiles did I say I have
a stay one
no not really okay well one point I'm
gonna cap this at some point but one
point eight 15 15 15 28 is stable how it
was like I said sure
forty-eight
that's fry 39:49 on 2/4 was stable once
before 33 from mash I haven't tried
pushing that up that'd be helpful if it
does
okay where is mash 1.38 my - this is
where I think what we'll have to do is
push the kingpin said you need to point
oh five on what on the memory I missed
his missed the context of his comment
anyway I think what I'm gonna do is get
it stable to a point where boots Steve
go to Taipei yeah I'd make it easier get
it stay what we should go which we
should get a Neely kingpin in California
or yeah probably that's the easiest and
I'll head out there and we all group up
with Jay and kingpin and do something
trying out to Butte get the GP is where
I want them and then submit whatever
score we have see what Jay releases in
the morning then respond to it after I
have time to sit down and work through
the memory timings because otherwise can
be really boring triangle trial and
error forever
you need good dims though Steve and also
good AMC yeah I know that's always that
is the that is the challenge I don't
know how good our our dimming a pretty
good but but they're not the best we
have a courser KITT that's pretty good
but I only have two sticks
it's a 4600 KITT rated it runs like 4100
with pretty tight timings but I only
have two sticks and running in dual
channel really seems to hurt the scores
on this bench versus quad
okay net IO dot sis not happy getting to
the point where it's just gonna blue
screen a lot just shunt already I did
the FE card anyway we did not do it on
the EVGA card we probably could though
you pain to do it I think what we should
probably do is put the EVGA card
underwater and get a custom loop going
with both cards because that EVGA cards
holding me back just because like the
cooler is fine but it's still in the 60s
and the other card I have in the forty
is and that's gonna benefit the clock a
lot I'm held back by of course memory
overclocking ability because that is a
weak point for a lot of us what am I
doing here let's uh let's default on the
defaults on the timings just to clear
them
remember Jay was using AC to lower the
temperature yeah
yes that would be a good move Steve bust
out the AC box we have too many too much
AC like to too many ventilation ports
it's all split through the whole office
what I need to do is get a chiller in
here
okay so X and P 4000 1.8 is more than
not 15 15 15 28 and that seems
it seems high why is that not all about
okay so let's just go let's see if it'll
boot it's my goal right now will it boot
just to get a final score in here or
21.3 vcore
Steve just run to Home Depot and buy a
standing unit they're like $300 or less
yes that seems like a good investment
I'll just get a chiller from someone in
the industry
that seems cheaper
how about the performance sliders in the
Nvidia control panel I didn't mess with
those I'll open it up though
what CP is he running on this 79 80 X II
is what we were running get an aquarium
cooler you love court - at 49 hips
whatever it is d letting it is the you
lettered sorry yes it did help
significantly
kingpin says dude all caps exclamation
point because I've quote-unquote forgot
the performance sliders in the control
panel
ie have never messed with for this I
can't see anything
alright let's let's do this Kanban let
me let's see what you're talking about
had those sliders to have a taste that's
a lot of points apparently okay so we're
even are these sliders are you talking
about the 3d setting sliders oh yeah
there is like that texture filtering
slider isn't there I forgot about that
one
nice good graphic
three sevens
okay 3d settings what even are the
slider options that I should be
adjusting sets performance no Sam's in
here hey Sam Sam who loaned us the Titan
axe
I missed missed the message where is it
Lawrence that's it that's it okay
well well settings are program settings
we don't use these for reviewing cards
performance
maximum performance okay power
management
so that's on max performance
and leave all these application
controlled I guess texture filtering are
those I guess those scores are still
valid or they're still valid when you
start changing the sliders I think they
are on Hardware BOTS
texture filter just image settings left
bar adjust image settings with PVA Oh
gotcha
okay gotcha gotcha gotcha
performance okay so it's a literally a
slider got it
now what about these do I need is the
score valid if we change these are now
I like Chat Chat Chat forgets that I've
got a screen on each side of me and
can't see both of the same as I can pen
do now manage 3d settings yeah we're
already there
ken Penrose build Zoid okay please
record how to do this for your viewers
with love a guide on the website from
campaign you yeah we do want to work
with KP on some of this stuff okay all
right now that everyone's calmed down I
think we think we got all these
appreciate the looking out set from
quality to hyper if did that did that
alright yeah there I think I got both of
them right there are two settings so I
got preferred maximum performance on
power management and I've got high
performance on texture filtering unless
I'm missing one somewhere no a threaded
optimization
sure now multiple CP is or multiple
cores which one
multiple CPUs we're not running multiple
CPUs triple buffering
okay all good now all right cool okay
let's see what kind of difference it is
I'm curious now if it's human stable we
changed some of memory to here so all
right so max that 180 offset was stable
originally I know it might not be a
optimal I guess for Delta clocks from
what was being said earlier what we'll
do 1,000 there just as I know it works
so I want to see what the difference is
from these and video settings and then
clock was 850 stable originally here 160
was stable here 123 okay 3dmark
check chat for a bit
all right don't forget your static
wristband those two sliders are key
kingpin is saying that instantly crasher
did I forget to I never launched it so
what's happening now and just just for
good measure let's just go back to
native resolution just to be consistent
if anything will work
okay
come on windows stop what are you doing
all right we're gonna let windows figure
out its life for a second it was unhappy
that I alt f4 it 3dmark I think okay
there we go all right cool
nope all right
okay there we go this file is not having
episodes a with it yes display settings
please
oh is it just like not launching the
display settings now that's nice
okay well we'll run it with the monitor
set in the non-native resolution and
wait for this to finish crashing again
delete system32 that's a good idea
that's probably the problem
so someone says you forgot to turn off
the fans on the second car do you
adjusted I actually didn't thank you for
looking out though it is um that card is
under liquid so that card is not even
using the fan the fan headers not even
connected in that one it's a we called
it a hybrid mod but it's just got a
liquid cooler on the core and then a
bunch of air blasting it from separate
fans Ida plugs into the motherboard
alright so let's launch this and then
let me not I have no idea of its stable
because we changed a lot of things all
at once so anyway let me give you the
most recent score we had I did apply the
settings the most recent score was
fourteen thousand two hundred nineteen
and then graphics was 1486 to what was
J's eight eight four I think I think
this was eight eight for Jo is fourteen
eight eight four and his total score was
fourteen thousand forty three so our
offline score has beaten his online
score but he says he has another offline
score that will beat our offline score
if you follow all that that's where we
stand right now I think that's
everything
to get everyone up to speed our CPU
scores 11,000 for 21 and yes I think
that I think that catches everyone up
damn
so system service exception probably
some of the memory or that 49x core I
had in there power settings already on
max performance guys
which card in which slot well precision
I don't think lists them in the order
they're installed was no someone said
one was on 49 but it's not okay so all
that looks fine we're not doing anything
crazy here
I think it's the memory tripping up
okay
five 15 15 15 28 should be stable 1.3 is
fine eight and then 48 okay see if that
works
they're not Nvidia control panel restore
defaults on 3d mark exe then set the
sliders just the high performance and
power settings and disable Windows
Defender it was just pasted a lot about
the hybrid video card the driver and
video card is happy with having no
response from the fan iron my old card
that always throttled if the fan stopped
yeah it doesn't seem to doesn't seem to
care does not it seems to work just fine
okay that was the cleanest boot we have
we've had in a while so let me get a
nvidia control panel and then i'm
following some steps here so restore
defaults on three marked IX e okay
manage 3d settings program settings give
me a small window right now
everybody has control panels extremely
slow 3dmark see it seems like we already
have the defaults so i think we're good
there and then set the slider is just
the high performance and power settings
and disable Windows Defender I think we
already got those set so is this still
high performance nope
quality high performance apply okay and
then manage these power settings max
performance is still there so that
stayed
okay and
I don't know how to navigate Windows 10
I stopped learning it on Windows 7
let's just go to services services
whereas my services services okay
I'm the defender it's already off yes
that is already deactivated this is
then that's off off
they're already often
okay all right I'll check chat in a
second all right I just want to run this
and see what even happens at this point
it's been a while hopefully it works
windows power plan should already be
hyper Florence
power I think that's already
high-performance yeah we're already
high-performance therefore the windows
power settings that much I always get on
a clean install ok alright so clock try
1000 because I know it used to work
plates the last 180 apply this is the
second cards we need to max out those
fans to apply and then first card he 50
was working 160 was working so if they
still are and power target 123 percent
benchmarks TSE run okay see if it goes
watch it instantly blue screen disable
the icon shadow text effect remark
appliance
I just got into what cpu-z running sorry
980 XD hey
three mark needs its profile change that
Trump's global settings okay I will
check that after this Thank You Stevie a
ship worldwide for any of your GN merch
we ship worldwide for all of the GN
merch
unless you're obviously in like North
Korea or something then no but otherwise
yes and if you're in North Korea you
should probably do something else than
watching this but yes we ship worldwide
on stored I can use access net Steve if
she's done tsuki someone says I hope
that becomes a thing that was if he
missed it earlier that's what kingpin
said haha at copy tax when his crazy
Alan to sort of semi closed loop system
was blue screen she's done ski Steve
kingpins been in chat by the way
and then the beer glasses are also
restocked on stored I can't read sexist
on that all right do you ship to
Antarctica no I've never tried if like a
carrier goes there sure why not hi
shipped to Australia that's I think
that's the most expensive shipping cost
for us as Oscar actually no there's some
random islands we've checked like
Pacific Islands that are really
expensive the ship do we set special
rules for those just so we didn't like
lose a ton of money on shipping done
skis equals the new F beer for liquid
coolant I think didn't J try that I
think J tried beer for like wood cooling
I'm pretty sure you did I don't rubber
how it worked out
all right yes Jay did it I am being told
Jay did actually try that
what is your CPU running on now it is
running on just pure just distilled
water nothing else no fancy coloring or
anything like that in the coolant just
distilled water and it is at 4.8
gigahertz
we're on 1 point 3 volts maybe I think 1
point 3 volts memory is at 4000 mega
Hertz and I think that recaps most the
specs what in the beer yeah I don't know
I don't know how the beer aged in that
leave J also tested milk okay all right
all right so this is Ronnie it hasn't
crashed yet it's not a CPU test where
the GPS house seems to kind of be alive
I'm scared to commit to an answer on
that so you had some super chance $5
create a shortcut on your desktop was
shut down exe to restart into o / r / f
w / T's 1 to restart into UEFI I have
one for shutting down to bypass the
windows updates but I did not know there
was one to give us straight into UEFI
that is cool if it's not a joke Thank
You Joshua $10 Jay has bios mods based
on his Twitter single score yes the
while these are old the Martin see 1 2 3
all hail Kane Ben yes that is do that
that is a good thing to hear King posted
two comments okay I have a treasure
place in the water with liquid metal
someone says can pin
Cayman says me and J had a lot of me in
all caps and J had a lot of fun benching
this GG Steve
so does this J know that as soon as he
left he just kept telling everyone that
you did all the work for him did you the
same thing that you're doing here
I feel like Kane pins like this Rainer
and he's he's he he he's so high up on
the scoreboards at this point that he's
gotten he's grown bored he's grown bored
with being the most powerful man in the
world and so now he has to go find
minions to make them overclock against
each other so like he can see which one
he can use to get a higher score
must be lonely on the top four years
kaypea I'm sorry I hope we provided you
some entertainment there we go that's a
big improvement
fourteen three six seven damn it god
damn that's a big jump so here's the
jump
have you tried dealing with tweezers the
jump is fifteen thousand fifty three
points and graphics now Master of
Puppets everyone saying dance my puppets
dance yes so he says I'm so lonely
that's sad
it's actually really sad so a great job
no great great job to you and chat so
here's the here's the I'm gonna walk
away from chat for a second just so I
can recap the scores for people so yes
you absolutely were right on the
performance settings so here's the
difference I didn't change anything on
the GPU clocks the Seaview change but
not the GPU and our GPA score previous
there's fourteen thousand eight sixty
two and now we're at fifteen thousand
fifty three so fifteen thousand 53 I
type that in and we got fourteen 367 for
total score previously we had fourteen
two one nine CPU is at eleven thousand
422 which is one point ahead of where
was that has not changed and I think
kingpin gonna post your results tonight
as well yeah I'll save it could call
save it will validate once I have
internet after the stream I guess what
is this even 14 367 let's save that 14
367 so J's score is live okay cool 14 8
8 4 is what J's is cool what did he post
what do you like go to the office to
post it remote in so what it has
where is he gaining all of his points
refreshing 3dmark hall of fame
1488 for
I'm still still loading 3dmark
hall-of-fame I don't did you guys like
crash it or something we've done that
before
can't get it to load when we did rappel
TT everybody in chat crashed the 3dmark
Hall of Fame and I email the people we
know they're gonna apologize I can't get
it to load if someone can load J's score
they're saying it's the a see if someone
can load J score tell me what his CPU
and GPU score are because like if you
still have it open don't refresh it cuz
you won't be able to get it back
I have not submitted this score yet so
you're not gonna see it there it's the
system's not connected to internet so if
someone has it open please tell me what
was his cpu score and his GPU score so
that I can know where I most need to
gain GPU 17-6 33 damn how does really
high
it's the AC kin pin says
okay so instead of what this one counter
said which is wait till the middle of
winter and open all the windows I think
no that's the old square some of you
person I think hmm what I want to do
probably is get the ice bucket ready for
the next theft
that's probably what we need to go buy
some some like kneadable eraser put it
around the PCB get some shop towel and
see if we can ice the thing and I also
need to put the EVGA one underwater so I
guess I'll get another water block for
that Jay's got the hookups for those I
have one card on air and he's got one
he's got one for sure on water I don't
know if Jay has both on water all right
so does anyone post Hall of Fame as
Gonski
kingpin sighs rib Hall of Fame weird so
what was did anyone actually post this
full score I see a bunch of the old
scores
17 633 is what I saw for GP I did not
see a CBO score posted 11 7 6 7 thank
you
11 767 okay so we're not too far from
that all right so what we're gonna do is
I'm going to save this and I already did
and I want to be on the stream I'll
upload that so we'll have that and the
number two slot apparently if I don't
have three marks even working right now
and then I need to all I need is RGB for
another 300 points apparently what I
need to do is is take some time and work
on the memory because that's where I
have the most room for improvement and
it's something that I just need to spend
a lot of time on with trial and error so
I think I can work on that I've seen a
lot of like wah why a lot of Hall of
Famers dunsky Steve she's done ski and
rip Hall of Fame F Hall of Fame site
can't be opened to Hans the hashtag
Gonski HOF did people can't even log
into their 3dmark accounts sorry alright
so yeah I'm going to spend some time
tonight working on more memory
overclocking until I can figure it out
get some other sticks out of storage if
any of them work well enough for this
and I think that's my biggest place to
gain the GPU is the next biggest place
the EVGA XE ultra has done really well
for us but it needs to be underwater so
I'm gonna have to find a water blogger
buy one or something probably buy and
another what does it called supremacy
Evo I think will fit and then I think
that's probably probably the best thing
to do at this point so yeah we need more
water and we need some chilling of the
water and and also wrapping everything
Steve when is the second memory video
coming out we're doing animations on it
so not too long still doing animations
chill that bad boy convinced says
alright ok you can get around the GPU
boost better vs better
yes GPU boost is a problem because it
like changes temperatures chase ah hang
on
hey I'm gonna put you on speaker hang on
you there okay
Angie can you hear the scores that
they're telling you they're trolling you
I did not get a score in the 17,000 GPU
I don't believe you okay yeah sorry
I saw your one on water was that an EVO
block for that okay gotcha
well screw you chat this is Jay on the
phone
Jay now they're saying Jays a troll okay
cool well the battle is on then and Jays
been a lot of fun doing this thank you
for answering the the call Kane pen by
the way has a message for you in chat he
says Jay it's time to get back to work
[Laughter]
Jays gone he's dead I don't know what
happened well j-just just so fair is
fair did you do your Nvidia control
panel changes because you should do
those if you haven't has been tight okay
yeah well so make sure you adjust the
slider settings so that it's fair so
high performance mode for those and then
video control panel 3d mark profile
because that overrides global from what
they're saying and then adjust image
settings with preview needs to be
high-performance no convinced that alone
okay nice I can't get mine that high I
don't think okay cool yeah I know
through a birdie yeah yeah hey man he's
he's yes I think that is a that is
accurate at this point yeah yes yes and
single score and also air is is really
going to hold back the the card that's
that I have that's air called because
like yeah they're actually right right
yeah we've gotten pretty low on air
they're running like well it's not
running right now but they were running
about a fifty degrees but I can
certainly be lower with water so nice
that's right cool
we'll keep it going thanks for calling
in you to see it so chat we have to talk
that was Jay last name two cents haha on
the phone and we're keeping it fair I
told him what kingpin told me not
keeping any secrets here he told me it's
all the stuff he's working on so we're
keeping it fair but each of us is still
doing the hardware work on our own so
chat you bastards I'm mocking up Olivia
here Jay has a 17,000 score and he's
pretty and he said that when we posted
the 14,000 367 he drove into the office
because he had some work to do I'm sure
he'll beat it cuz it sounds like he's
got a pretty good hardware setup so Paul
is done ski is now what everyone's
saying yes that is true all right
convinced us I like this fight I think
KP if you're still watching here's what
I think
I think of course we wanted you to visit
the office at some point too but I would
be happy to fly out to California and
meet with you and J if you can if you
can meet us in like the EVGA HQ so J and
I will keep this going and we'll go as
far as we can on our own up until we
need some expert an expert to laugh at
us and then what we should do is get the
three of us together at HQ and see what
we can do there so I think that'd be a
lot of fun but until that point I have a
lot of work to do J has a lot of work to
do we're currently ahead of him
sounds like he's going back into the
office right now to try and get ahead of
us because chat chat was lying to me
believe it or not Chad said that he had
a way higher score than he presently
does so the battle is still very well on
we're gonna call it at 14,000 367 I'm
going to upload this score and I'm gonna
get to work doing it myself on the
memory overclocking so no I'm not gonna
call Kane pan I am going to just sit
here and read about the different
timings so I can I need to finally learn
more about how to tune them anyway to
improve so improving our content will
benefit from this and then then trial
and error and I'm gonna get some water
blocks in oh and Mustaine's by Matt says
thanks for the Acronis suggestion I hope
that worked for you man okay so that's
where we stand for that stuff
chatez dunsky it's a thing it's a thing
kingpin has spoken
scroll up okay what kingpin to say I
need to like set KP as a mod or
something kingpin says let's do it Steve
so you're the eastcoast yes KP says
let's do it so there's the plan then
we'll work with the EGA and figure out
timing there's launches coming up Intel
and all that 2070 of course so we'll
figure out timing but it should be a lot
of fun and yes we will we'll get back to
work it'll be it'll be tons of fun so
really looking forward to pushing this
fight onward Jace J's fun guy to work
with on this check out his channel J's
two cents if you don't know what it is
I'm gonna go through some super chats
here we pull a lot to go through
don't send anywhere super chats I got to
get through what we have
so Mustaine's my mat was the last one I
saw I'm not gonna read I'll try not to
read any past there but let me get
through some of these and just a note we
have some non GPU videos going up this
week so we have a liquid metal cleaning
video and then we have a tariffs video
that's pretty interesting so stay tuned
for those of you're sick with GPU
content will be doing another stream
pretty soon we still won't have
production systems in the office we have
one and it just almost caught our
headphones on fire more on that later
uh uh-huh yeah a lot more on that later
maybe so
still need to build those I want to do
that on stream so keep an eye out for
those announcements someone says Jay
died no Jay is not literally dead he's
driving into his office to return fire
invite Paul to the battle Paulie
you've totally invited KP say that says
thanks guys there was a lot of fun Thank
You kV for joining it was a lot of fun
pretty quality in here and Paul get an
unveiling Ridge man join in I know bit
wit has one just steal it from him you
know he's not gonna use it just blasting
his with like some fan he bought at Home
Depot or something and yes happy
birthday to kingpin of course all right
so super chats let me get through these
so we had I think we stopped ahead um
let's do it Ezekiel Alfonso oh no I got
that one we got this one too Josh White
we got that one got all hail king pin
okay Caius four shunt mods is graphite
not viable like the old Athlon pencil
trick the trouble with I don't know I
haven't used graphite but the trouble
with doing some stuff like if you short
the shunt with just a short wire I think
Jabbar finally demonstrated this if you
sure it was just a wire and the wire
gauge isn't good
then you will drop into 2d clocks the
card detects that it freaks out and it
drops the clocks to like 300 megahertz
so you need to use like a piggyback
resistor or something like that there
Bower and builds would have both done
talking about this recently
Adam Brisbane $5 Steve hope my CP is
arrives all yes probably I forgot
out the adat in the first box which
surprised us of those numbers all in row
can you increase the brightness of the
stream it seems dark oops sorry we'll
keep that in mind for next time
probably got it we're gonna do a fan
mail second at some point Mac true 241
secret weapon got that not an end video
of the guy but I do love all your
content keep it up from red shadow
twenty nine and nine ten dollars thank
you very much and oh yeah I got a note
from one of our guys on the team so
about mod Matt's like I said they are on
the stores destroy Karen's ex design
that they're actually in stock now
they're not backordered anymore if you
buy it it'll shift this week if not
tomorrow and then the mouse pads I
forgot to mention I've been using during
this stream so we might make a black
version at some point there's some
interest but we have a blue and white
mouse pad that we're really happy with
it's got super high I just like really
vibrant colors on it and that is I think
a pretty good size so anyway that's
there I'll just mention that on the
store if you want to pick something up
from the store and we really need three
stock shirts because a lot of you bought
most of those all right so we got please
record how to do this for your viewers
would love a guide yes we will work on
that see tightened timings ben snead so
yes i got a lot of these cons as well
okay almost up to where we left off Oh
somewhat new to GN why so much hate for
Ltd there's no hate for Ltd it was like
a fun thing repel TT was not like
literally hating ltte I we were gonna
find his lies he's a good guy to work
with
okay I'm trying to catch up to super
chats I'm sorry
rip J and Paul $10 Cameron grieve what
do you think Andy are doing right now
about ray tracing I don't know they had
some ray tracing stuff that they pushed
like years ago year or two ago and if
AMD is is playing their cards right
literally I think they should just push
like Vega 56 and because the prices come
down so much like I said the add links
below but I was looking at the five 80s
and Vega for the six card when power
color approached us and one looks at the
prices were like wow there
an option again and I feel like and
these to quiet on it so I'd really like
to see AMD kind of do some kind of push
and say like hey guys the mining things
over it's done it's done ski as we've
said in chat and the cards aren't like
ridiculously overpriced anymore because
they do have good stuff I don't think
they need to go with a rate racing route
yet just like get up to where we are
today or get some market share okay so I
caught up to where we were just
scrolling we got Nate Dogg five dollars
can you do a BIOS overclocking video or
point me to a good tutorial seems like
everyone's methodologies completely
different yes it is clearly we all have
limitations I have a lot of limitations
on the skill so you start looking like
build Zoid has hour long videos per
motherboard that would be a good place
to go if you really want to get into it
but there are plenty of guides for
easier overclocking overclock net I
would honestly recommend a written
tutorial not a video tutorial overclock
dotnet has really good user community
guides I strongly recommend it
WC current got that answer Tech Jesus is
the kingpin of kingpins that I don't
know if that means
bobis commentary $2.00 J's didn't pay
see cooler on his CPU I don't know who
to believe anywhere Ryan $5 let it burn
increase the thrust to 150 percent that
is what we did the Martin see that I
just call it GPU modded voltage nope
sadly not modded voltage we could use
that though John Stevens donate to me a
twenty atti and he gave $25 not really a
fair trade method method you really not
gonna answer man what shampoo do you use
no I'm not gonna answer I already told
you the answer it's thorough face Jason
Christophe $5 when benching or stressing
1800 X cpuid says frequency says on
frequency then when stopped it says oh
one frequency that one's thoughts is a
higher frequency is this a glitch I've
seen as high as 4300 i cpuid says one
frequency then one stopped it says
another higher yes set power mode the
high performance and use hardware info
64 instead for more accuracy hardware in
6 info 64 is really good software if you
don't have it
Sam T $10 thank you much hey J I love
your work you
events while I'm here any EVGA guys
still here maybe help me out with a
780ti kingpin got a 1200 want more but
can't find any up-to-date forums tools
or biases I don't think you need
up-to-date just find a find an old one
and they're plenty good and even today J
the peach at $5 does envy link bridge
fit for 220 atti Strix is as of now and
what size should I buy it does just make
sure the cards are the same height and
you're fine you want runs the problem we
did and then also what size you should
buy depends on the slot spacing on your
motherboard so check how many slots
there are gaps between the cards just
like this I don't know if there's two
slot space and I forget but if they have
different slot spacings and we have
store much $10 sending Steve some pizza
money to ask a question that was already
asked dozens of times
how was the new office streaming setup I
notice the tables much less obably yeah
well this one is like a 350 pound table
that's 8 feet long so I don't know
that'd be pretty damn hard to get to
wobble
it's great though we love the office
stream and set up so much easier to set
up we can do stuff like the next thing
you're gonna see is probably me putting
that thing in a chiller because or an
ice bucket maybe not a chiller because I
mean like look at all the space we lined
up the other table over here
specifically for use with an ice bucket
never used it but like we've got the
space now so we do some really cool
stuff don't mind the glass cleaner we're
filming cases so we have plenty of space
and really looking forward to using it
more for for other streams and videos
$5.00 from stinky feet love my bod Matt
and want a cup now will you be doing
golds chalices with the giant precious
jewels tin we have talked about a
special piece of glassware but I guess
I'll stop there but we do have some
pretty cool ideas for what we can do
next
thank you for buying the mod Matt that's
awesome and and thank you for your
interest in the glass or the mug
whatever it is there on the store if
anyone wants them linked below Ivy Mike
$5 does a 6-pin on the Emma
20 ATT I make a difference I don't know
I don't have it yet
$5 let me see current here's $5 buy a
bag of ice this is now a cold war shunts
fired
nicely done we will do that autumn bones
my 1080 is you I answered your question
earlier Nick $5 put the whole test bench
in an enclosed box with a/c directing
into the box yeah I guess I'd do
something that my bypass the
condensation concerns Travis somewhat
new to out got that question why the
hate for Al TT there isn't actually any
hate we respect each other
add on the Schumann senior $20 rip J rip
Paul since you would not let me sponsor
a table I was sponsored snowflakes have
it $25 for cat treats thank you very
much Adam who then followed up inside $5
oops here's the other five thank you
Adam Michael Morales 499 are all our TX
cards power stars when overclocked e and
will board partners be able to go beyond
what nvidia suggests or is that a no-go
sort of but even they have limitations
so yes they are all power starve they
are voltage starved as well but maybe
for a good reason i made a check normal
chat for a mon how is how is it how is
chat going they're still pasting the
graphics scores
i guess it's probably people who are who
are like catching up behind a bit thanks
for the tip spence does he's still in
here or something so alright so chats
just kind of handed out paul's here
apparently wait is Paul here see
actually here Paul responded where is
this Paul you speak of Paul's hardware
says would love to join if that is in
response to in response to the like
kingpin Jathan a TV GHQ definitely join
that be fun
alright good to see you Paul so yeah
final score for those who asked was
14,000 367 points Jays current score
which I need to upload the soon before
he beats fine is a
14000 43 and we're gonna keep this going
he called in for a bit we talked he
exposed chat
the wires you all are and we're gonna
keep it going so I'm about three hundred
points ahead of him in total score right
now but I know he's got a lot of his
sleeve so we will definitely be
responding again mommy went to sleep all
right so a couple more to go through I'm
FMO our five dollars thank you much
Steve we'll all these burns tonight with
all these burns tonight will we be
seeing a reveal for gamers Nexus brand
white mints
nicely done okay
Dave five dollars when is the raglan oh
yeah Ragland hoodies coming back and
stalking about a week or two answered
that one so vile si two dollars please
sexy hardware setup for new viewers
showed that earlier
what CB are you running 700 exe did why
why I think guys why why'd he do this
Jennifer Roger five dollars can we get
winter GN hats or beanies we have talked
about potentially doing beanies
so yeah we can look into it for sure
Michael Morales is overclocking any GPU
producing enough gains to truly make it
tangible enough considering the
additional wear and noise I honestly
don't like if I'm in a game I'm not
gonna overclock my GPU to do it unless
it's really holding me back like if
you're on say you're on like a 1070 TI
and you want a 1080 maybe in terms of
performance you can overclock and equate
a 1080 in fact you can even get pretty
close to an overclocked 1080 so there
are times it's worth it but it's easier
if it's underwater if you have really
good airflow so you don't have to worry
about the noise too much Richard 499
Richard Torelli loved the live streams
are you not running the 10% discount
where I live this time no we are gonna
run the 10% discount though in the next
fan mail segment I think I might just do
it in those as a like a viewer like
giving back thing because the fan mail
should be a lot of fun to do anyway just
with the viewers core audience
PR Captain Planet 150 NT Titan Tia Rafi
Toulouse also been sent down to PA's
Jeff's on HK $5.00 thank you much
Seville sa record oh you got that
question already we're just going
through all the super chats I'm always
caught up pickles the greatest $2 J's
score is live 1488 4 on 3dmark hall of
fame is that one reality no no not gonna
fall for it
you're on $2 I like Chinese food fun
thank you very much first apocalypse
nope let's go that post-apocalyptic
Peter I'll get back to it I'll find it
while he's here build Zoidberg 1v1
kingpin no rope oh yeah I'd be cool if
they both have the same like budget and
setup the mage $5 Steve make a larger
limited edition mod Matt have it ready
for the 4th of July

need to get the expert Luke from Linus

his role as the mineral oil expert he
once told me a story about how at Best
Buy he they didn't recognize him and
they started telling him about mineral
oil cooling pcs and he the way he said
describes it to me and he was talking it
was going through his head he was like

that I am mineral oil cooling pcs

doing more of this and GM logo pinna we
can look into that too but there's stuff
on the stores start out guarantees
access dotnet will be doing more extreme

of non GPU content coming up of course
for the scores one more time just
because people just skip to the end when
they're watching the upload it is 14,000

teen Pen himself join chat and gave me
some suggestions on how to improve the
graphics score number in fairness I told
Jay what those improvements were so
we're on the same footing we're not
taking just like pure help from a
literal professional so Jay has that
same information he will be responding
