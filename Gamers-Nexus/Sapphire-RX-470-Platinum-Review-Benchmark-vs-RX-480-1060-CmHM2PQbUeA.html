Sapphire Platinum Edition card turned
out to be mostly correct that is what
this is right here this is the 470
available as of today it's a $180 card
that we're reviewing in this video the
price point plants it 20 dollars cheaper
than the 4 gigabyte rx 480 or 60 dollars
cheaper than the 8 gigabyte model of the
487 T cheaper than the GTX 1060 partner
model cards some of them anyway looking
at you ASIS and the card is targeted at
1080p gaming with ultra settings hitting
hopefully 60fps from what and ease of
marketing text has promised and these
are exports 17 rx 460 our partner only
cards so you won't find reference models
of these on the shelves that means that
pricing clock rate in coolers will vary
partner to partner as one might expect
the model that we have is running what
is effectively a reference are X 480
cooler just with a new color for
sapphires platinum line here's a look at
the specs table for the RX 470 which we
published initially in our our X 480
review and have updated the RX 470 is a
cut-down version of what we saw at the
480 Ellesmere chip still running 5.7
billion transistors but now on 32 see
use instead of that 480 s 36 to use and
that lands the RX 470 at 2048 stream
processors down from 2300 for on the RX
480
the RX 470 has a recommended clock rate
range of 926 megahertz core and 1206 at
megahertz boost we observed the sapphire
platinum card boosting at maximally to
about 1215 megahertz and the GPU runs
128 TM use and 32 ROPS
which sheds light on the decision to
limit the card to 4 gigabytes and a
gigabyte model would likely become
limited elsewhere in the pipe before
memory the memory subsystem of the RX
470 is mostly the same as the our X 480
including memory compression and
low-level technology but the memory
itself is of a lower spec so the color
compression is all there DCC all of
that's there but the RX 470 is running
an actual memory clock of 1750 megahertz
for the model we have with the whole rx
470 range spanning six point six
gigabits per second to seven gigabits
per second so we're not hitting that 8
mark that the 480 hits the card is still
on a 256
memory interface and uses gddr5 with a
bandwidth of 211 gigabytes per second as
for TDP the RX 470 is targeting a 120
watt TDP which just as a reminder isn't
the actual card power draw in terms of
watts it is actually more of a
measurement of the thermal requirements
for the card for the GPU so you can't
look at this 120 watt TDP and go okay
that's comparable to Nvidia's whatever
cards might be 120 watt TDP it doesn't
really work that way it's just a
reminder there so 120 watt TDP it's a 10
watt climb from what was initially
unveiled in May at the press event for
Polaris and for more information on the
architecture itself you can check our
article link through the description
below or just view our rx 40 review
where we break down the whole thing with
more depth in terms of this card here
the design is pretty simple so there's a
back plate from sapphire and that's been
added to effectively again a reference
cooler for the RX 480
the reference cooler when we tore it
down has a very simple and cheap
aluminum heatsink inside of it just
aluminum fins with a copper cold plate
no vapor chambers or a copper heat pipes
or anything like that so very simple
cooling technology on this particular
model let's get to the test and you can
see the bench we use on the screen now
and we're starting with thermals which
are more important than probably often
thought and then we'll move on the power
and fps testing check the article into
the description below for our full
testing methodology and additional
charts not found here with thermal
sapphires rx 470 Platinum Edition isn't
that impressive given that it's using a
reference arts for you heat sink the
card operates at 53 Celsius delta T over
ambient and 7.59 idle a fair bit reduced
from the rx 480 reference as a result of
the lower TDP GPU the reference 480 just
as a note sits at 50 6.3 Celsius a load
and here's a look at the chart as
plotted against time it's the same data
but presented in a way that shows the
ramp up as our in-house automation kicks
in switching over to some more unique
endurance charts we see a better look at
real-world performance with frequency
versus temperature plotted against a
two-hour burnin at the bottom the arcs
were seventy exhibits almost identical
endurance performance to the artist 480
reference card were seen fluctuating
frequency as a means to restrict the
temperature
to a 77 Celsius ceiling each time
temperature hits 78 Celsius on the GPU
diode the clock rate is throttled until
the clock returns to a 76 to 77 Celsius
value and that's what's producing this
choppiness because the fluctuations are
never more than 100 megahertz the impact
the gameplay is mostly undetectable by
the user but 1% lows and 0.1% lows will
occasionally be improved by different
cooling solutions depend on what card
you're using and we just saw that with
the MSI our X 480 gaming X and the
hybrid 480 that we built ourselves and
here's a look at a similar chart but
with the fan rpm percentage plotted the
fan sticks around 46% in its out of box
configuration making for a tolerable mix
of noise and performance on this card
and also note that the blower fan of the
RX 470 Platinum Edition maxes out closer
to 4,000 rpm rather than hitting the
5200 RPM of the our X 480 reference card
this next chart is a measurement of
apparent power draw in volt amps note
that this is a measurement of total
system power draw not individual card
draw so we're mostly comparing Delta's
here with the RX 470 in the test bench
we see about a 222 volt amp draw load
and about 80 volts amps idle the our X
480 version of the bench sits at around
240 volt amps load and for reference the
gtx 1060 is about 220 volt amps just
below the RX 470 let's move on to FBS
testing again full methodology linked in
the description below we used the new as
of today unreleased drivers for the RX
470 they are 16 8.1 drivers so that's
what was used for testing we did not
have the same crashing issues and
instability that we saw in 1673 on 16 8
1 so these were stable for testing
starting with GTA 5 GTA 5 performs at 77
FPS average on the arch 470 when run at
1080p it was very high in ultra settings
effectively maxed out in the graphics
tab with no advanced graphics options
enabled the our X 480 runs at 85 FPS
average for the 8 gigabyte model or a
difference of 10.2 percent between it
and the 470
low frame rates are acceptable between
both cards now that AMD has resolved GTA
stuttering with its driver updates and
the GTX 1060 EFI runs at 95 FPS average
a percent difference of 20 point 9
with the RX 470 the GTX 970 SSC the EVGA
super-super clocked model places ahead
of the RX 470 at 89 f PS average just
for point of reference the RX 470 was
pushing fifty three point seven FPS
average at 1440p more or less playable
in GTA 5 though it's point one percent
low metrics were at 31 fps and 36.3 for
the one percent Louis black ops three is
optimized well for its level of visual
fidelity and also generally post results
that are favorable toward Andy this
reinforces the fact that graphics cards
are very development dependent when it
comes to extracting performance at 1080p
the RX 470 is capable of hitting at 116
FPS average retaining fairly tightly
timed at one percent low and 0.1% low
values at 94 and eighty five point seven
FBS respectively that places the RX 470
above the pre overclocked GTX 970 SSC
buy a couple frames and just under the
gtx 1060 founder's edition card the RX
480 reference card performs at 132 FPS
average with a maasai variant at 144
average so black ops 3 proves to be
somewhat clock sensitive with these
cards depending on the settings and
that's shown with a IV partner models
against the reference cards because
performance in black ops 3 is optimized
for high graphics we decided to test
1440p playability on the RX 470 and the
card pushes a high average of 17.3 fps
and that's about even with the GTX 970
SOC and not far from the 1060 F II but
falls on its 1% and 0.1% low values this
is precisely why we measured those 0.1%
numbers if you were to simply take the
average the fact that the game stutters
to a point of being mostly unplayable
especially a multiplayer would be
entirely overlooked because the averages
smooths out these values watch are what
are 1% and 0.1% low is a video for more
on this testing methodology Doom
recently received its anticipated Vulcan
patch touted at both the recent Nvidia
and AMD press conferences and we've been
working on building up a new test
database with that game our original
launch tests for doom are not comparable
to these results as the game
optimization and drivers have changed
substantially note that we're also
hoping to revisit doom Vulcan testing
with exploration of addition
settings within the game like TSS a a
but we're still working through the
other content first let's start with
OpenGL only test with OpenGL and the
game at 1080p ultra settings we're
seeing a performance output of 75 that
seven FPS average on the RX 470 and
that's what's sustaining lows of 58 and
55 FPS the RX for 80 runs at 85 FPS
average a difference of 11.6 percent
between the 470 in the 480 and the 2
cards have comparable lows between them
with the same settings the GTX 10 at 60
F ecard performs at 98.3 FPS average a
difference of 26% between the 1060 F II
and the RX 470 that changes it with
Vulcan enabled the RX 470 now operates
at 98.7 FPS average effectively tied
with the gtx 1060 and a few FPS behind
the 1060 game in Ex the arch 480 runs a
little more than 10 FPS faster than the
rh 470 and ahead of the 1060 gaming X in
terms of average framerate output here's
1440p with OpenGL and doom we're seeing
a 50 point seven FPS output on the RX
470 and the RX 488 gigabyte card is at
57 FPS average the gtx 1060 founder's
edition is at 66 FPS average and when we
switch over to vulcan the performance
wanes the RX 472 60 4.8 Everidge and
that's a difference of 24.4% compared to
the RX 480 the gtx 1060 fe4 reverence is
now at lower slightly lower positioning
in the hierarchy just below the RX 470
with its 63 FPS average neros Edge
catalyst at 1080p ultra has the RX 470
exceeding 60 FPS average delivering on
and these marching claims and promises
with a 65 point 3 FPS output against the
RX 488 gigabyte reference card there's a
difference of nearly 13% and still both
cards have issues with 0.1% little frame
times landing around 30 fps and the gtx
960 SSC runs slightly faster in 0.1
percent lows but an overall lower
average the gtx 1060 for comparison sits
at 82 FPS average and 56.7 0.1% lows but
is obviously more expensive than the rx
we're 70 by quite a bit 1440p post
similar results with the RX for 70
struggling to sustain a playable frame
rates and a 0.1% lows are below 20 fps
producing noticeable choppiness and
stutters during gameplay and making it
for an overall unplayable experience but
again the card was built for 1080p not
for 1440p moving on to overclocked in
the process of overclock in the RX 470
is effectively identical to what we
showed in our how to overclock the RX 4
80 guide Polaris hasn't changed of
course between the two cards so really
it's the same wot man stepping process
that we showed previously the RX 470 we
ran into OC limitations pretty early in
the process as shown by this stepping
chart that's on the screen now we
settled it with an OC of 1250 megahertz
core and 1800 megahertz on the memory
which is the limitation in watt man
that's the maximum amount we could push
this memory we were able to dial voltage
back to 11 60 millivolts and produced a
peak GPU power draw of 164 watts
compared to the stock clocks 110 watt
GPU power draw and that's a fairly big
jump but one that is expected with the
extra 50% power target and note when I
say GPU power draw here I mean as drawn
and shown by techpowerup by the GPU
specifically that does not include other
board components like memory here's a
look at some of the framerate changes
with that OC applied as usual we're
seeing a couple percentage points win in
most games with more clock sensitive
titles exhibiting obviously more change
still the Rh 470 didn't see that far 12
50 megahertz from a gaming clock rate of
1215 megahertz measured and that's it's
really just not a big game that we get
out of the overclocking process it is
more stable though at 12 50 megahertz
fixed as opposed to the boost
variability of the stock setup the RX 4
70s MSRP is $180 from Andy but we don't
know what the partner cards will be
priced at just yet if we receive those
prices before this video is uploaded but
during post or something we'll put it in
a title card but otherwise check the
link description below for the article
I'll detail that as soon as we have
partner card pricing but the MSRP target
is 180 dollars and that's what we're
gonna go off of here at $180 to running
20 less than the 4 gigabyte model the RX
480 and we're getting about a 10%
difference not percent change %
difference
performance of the 484 gigabyte card and
the 474 gigabyte card if you want to
look specifically at the differences
between 4 and 8 gigabytes on the RX 480
check our video for that on the channel
it's relevant in some cases but not all
it just it depends on what games you're
playing
how vram intensive they are and things
like that if you want it to push 1440p
it might be worth looking at the 480
even the 4 gigabyte model though again
kind of push you towards the 8 gigabyte
one or the 1060 cheaper AIB partner
cards at 6 gigabytes but if you're
really trying 1440p the 4 gigabyte RX 4
80
will get you a couple extra frames that
is kind of a make or break in a few
specific cases but otherwise it's this
card for the most part is a better value
GTA 5 at 1080p it showed about a 10%
difference the same is true for Mirror's
Edge catalyst same is true again for
black ops 3 and when we did push 1440p
we sometimes see serious detriment for
the 470 in its 1% and 0.1% lower frame
time is specifically the 0.1% low frame
times though with black ops if you go
look at that chart but that's only in
some titles the arch for 70 presently
faces no competition in its price
bracket assuming it can indeed be had
for $180 and for 1080p gaming if you're
considering the 484 gigabyte we'd
suggest that you go for 74 gigabyte or
488 gigabyte instead or of course the
GTX 1060 and skip the 4 gigabyte 480
almost entirely as for sapphires
Platinum Edition of the card so-called
Platinum Edition I'm really not big on
the heatsink this is the same cooler
that shipped on the reference are X 480
so we'd advise as we did then against
the purchase of this card the heatsink
is about as cheap as it gets and thermal
thresholds trigger around 78 Celsius
frequently achieved and that results in
spurious frequency output when he
plotted against time MSI ACS XFX
everyone else have I even have other 470
cards but we haven't yet received them
that we do have a few on the way so the
470 Platinum Edition all it is it's a
reference for a tea cooler painted
silver with the same cooling components
inside of it as a platform the RX 470 is
one of the best price to performance
cards available on the market today if
you're looking these
$200 price point and that's really
mostly because it has no competition so
looking at last gen which mostly current
cards in this price point are at this
point you have the 380 X which this
handily outperforms in most cases and
does outperform in all cases and you
also the gtx 960 4 gigabyte and 2
gigabyte cards even against the SSC 4
gigabyte 960 this one is a faster option
the RX 470 of course and for Nvidia
there's no current gen stuff that's in
this price bracket yeah obviously that
will change because these this is still
an evolving market we're not considering
the used market that's up to you to
consider if you want to look at that
it's too volatile for review purposes
but that's certainly an option as well
but not when I generally recommend so
that really just leaves the rx 470 as
the main option in this price point
other than Andy's own competition which
would be the 4 gigabyte rx 480 and that
card at this point knowing the price of
this one is just really oddly positioned
you're kind of in a gtx 950 scenario
where it just doesn't quite fit at its
launch price so we would be looking at 4
cards that you should consider in the
sort of current 180 to 250 ish dollar
price range you'd be looking at a 470 if
you're trying to save some money you're
just playing 1080p or a 488 gigabyte
card or a 1066 AAA card which is the
only one by the way so those would be
the three options I would steer you
toward if you're trying to spend that
amount of money we've done reviews of
all of them there's three only real
options right now you can read all the
reviews or just look through the charts
