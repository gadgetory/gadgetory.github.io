can apply up to 600 metric tons of
downward force and it's used for
stamping outside panels for cases pretty
crazy
and this thing is easily 20 feet tall I
didn't measure it easily 20 feet tall
does 600 tons of downward force for
stamping out metal and it costs 2
million US dollars this was just part of
the NZXT factory tour that we recently
took in China before getting into that
all this Computex coverage is brought to
you by a messiahs new x99 motherboard is
ready for Broadwell ii including the x99
a gaming pro carbon as many of you know
we already visited in win' in their
Taiwan or Tao en Taiwan facilities we
hopped over from the Taipei area to
Shenzhen and then drove from there to
Dongguan which is where mzx Keys Factory
is and I'm sure I'm pronouncing these
things terribly so the factory was
pretty darn cool it was built in 2000
it's got about 1200 full-time employees
and this is largely dominated by NZXT
and their production team for cases and
whatever else they may be making but
basically all cases at this specific
facility first of all just to give an
overview of the manufacturing process
for a case this starts with making tools
and we previously interviewed george
makers of corsair about this specific
part of the process of you're curious to
learn more but tooling as a brief
overview is the process of creating what
is effectively a mold made out of steel
and it's it's not quite a mold like you
might find for injection but it is a
giant piece of steel it's milled out and
cut using CNC machines and other tools
sometimes laser etching machines
depending on what factory you're looking
at what we saw mostly at NZXT these
factories were the automated CNC
machines and these operate on
coordinates input by software and
they're designed of course by a designer
or engineer those coordinates translate
to the head which is h's out the shapes
and specific cuts that need to be made
in the steel is of metal they're very
heavy they weigh upwards of a metric ton
a thousand kilograms more or less and
they
need to be separated by these really
cool green pieces of plastic I'm not
sure what the material is it feels kind
of like a fancier ABS but it looks like
ballistics gel it is not so this is a
green piece of plastic they cut out
using another machine and they stack
these between the tools to ensure that
they don't damage one another just
because of how monstrously heavy the
tools are for perspective on where the
tools are used the H 440 power supply
shroud alone requires six independent
tools just to make that little abode out
cover that hides the power supply with a
piece of steel so that is six tools
independently and shows how quickly they
can stack up to be 60 70 or 100 plus now
one of the things with the tooling
process is there need to be very fine
tolerances for the tools so the
engineers have a specification that is
provided to the factory and the factory
needs to make sure that the tools that
match that specification what are the
ways they do this is by using something
cool called an electrical discharge
machine and this machine refines tools
down to a tolerance of within 0.005
millimeters that is crazy small for
tolerances and this is done purely with
heat so they'll electrically charge this
sort of hammer at the top at the tip of
the machine the discharge machine and
the hammer will smash down on the piece
of the tool that needs to be refined and
it applies instant heat to that tool
which then shaves off very fine amounts
of the metal to make sure that the tool
fits the tolerances in NZXT steel
factory the tools are used in all the
machines to punch the metal into shapes
demanded by the spec metal is generally
supplied to the punch machines via a
large reel so it's a giant circular she
think of packing tape except made of
metal insanely heavy and expensive this
is mounted to these machines and it
unwinds over the period of making the
different panels and pieces of the case
so as this unwinds it is fed into
rollers and eventually meets the
stamping machine the stamping machines
slam down into the metal and cut out the
shape that is demanded and some of these
machines are gargantuan in size as you
saw the beginning of it
the 20-foot tall sa g600 can apply 600
metric tons of downward force to the
material and these previously worked on
the source 210 side panels so they
weren't working on that today and the
machine again is two million dollars USD
the next step of this process is quality
control and this happens toward the end
of the stamping line so the panels and
pieces of the case are fed down to the
line all the way to the end of the
factory and the technicians at the end
of this line use their calipers and
other tools to check a very fine
measurements of the paneling to make
sure it meets the tolerances demanded
again by the engineers if the component
passes is then fed into effectively a
giant stamping machine that punches
holes for the screws that later get put
into the case or the rivets or whatever
may be needed for pass-throughs for
mounting hardware
there's also plastic injection molding
and this happens pretty much in the
exact same way as we showed in the in
one factory tour but we've got some new
information that I didn't have then that
I'd like to present here injection
molding uses pellets of plastic that are
fed into a hopper so you'll see the
hopper toward the top of these things
those contain very small just tons and
tons of pellets of plastic and these are
dropped into an electrical heating
element warmed up and the output is
basically injected into the mold that is
provided where eventually it'll cool
down and become the hardened plastic
shells that everyone's familiar with for
example there's found on the Phantom
cases and these are then processed by
technicians and operators who will go
about the routine of packing them or
preparing them for inclusion in the
assembly line eventually the case
reaches the riveting line for the
Phantom 820 and this is still being
manufactured believe it or not the
phantom 820 requires about 56 people to
rivet and assemble and the line can
produce 50 to 60 phantom 820 s per hour
so for perspective because that's not a
useful metric has its own ngx ease
assembly line is able to push about 150
H 440 s per hour and about 200 to s to
tens per hour this for me personally was
very eye-opening as to the cost of a
case and what goes into it because if
you've got the choice of producing 50 to
60 phantom e 20s
you know you can produce 200s to tens
per hour obviously there's a bit of a
cost-benefit analysis there you have to
figure out where the cutoff point is
what the MSRP is things like that and if
you're curious about how they go about
deciding when to make these cases it is
largely by some of the forecasting done
by retailers they'll pin NZXT or other
relevant manufacturers say hey we're
running low on this particular product
we're gonna need more soon and that is
actually a very challenging problem to
grasp in terms of logistics because
these products are all first of all they
have to be made they have to be shipped
by boat that takes about three weeks to
the west coast five weeks to go to
Europe and that means in order to make
sure there's never a complete absence of
stock the company NZXT in this case has
to have a lead time of about five weeks
on their order just for safety and then
there's of course a week or more in
customs and processing and things like
that but aside from the logistics
there's also the painting process and
this includes powder coating for NZXT
teas factory powder coatings a bit more
eco-friendly than some of the normal
painting means and before getting to
powder all the panels are fed through
water they are cleaned of dust and other
debris that may have collected on the
panel while being manufactured and
stamped and one of the cooler things is
the air blasting so they'll blast the
panels with compressed air to again push
the dust off and dry them out from the
water and then there's heating - so this
happens right before the case is fed
into the automated powder coating line
the they'll be blowtorch to PI an
operator who heats them up then the
cases are fed into the line they're
completely clean and free of any
contaminants the powder coating machine
uses giant nozzles that move up and down
vertically on the walls and these just
dump powdered paint onto the panels to
make sure they are evenly coated all of
the powder that's left over is
ventilated out of the chamber and into
what is effectively a filter so that the
chamber remains clean and finally in the
painting process this is all done as the
case is mostly riveted together at this
point so that means there are some space
is on the case that may be missed by the
machines and in order to account for
that technicians will manually check and
apply paints where there is a lack of
presence of that paint so all of this
done the final part of the factory is of
course assembly where it is packaged
together you'll see that with some of
the Phantom 820 s in our video packaged
together put into a box shipped out to
the customer and sent by boat so that
concludes our tour of NZXT keys
factories in Dongguan China and as
