weirder liquid cooler designs on the
market this is the NZXT m22 the pump is
located centrally in the radiator now
this has a few implications for thermals
but the major implication is a legal one
the reason that companies like NZXT and
their supplier apalla tech work with
different orientation or location pumps
in the loop is because ASA Tech actually
holds a patent in the US that's been
upheld against Coolermaster specifically
for the site on Ceres that states that
more or less the pump in the CPU block
design is an ace attack design where
else do you put it well apparently you
put it in the middle of the radiator and
to their credit that's about the best
thing you could do because it does make
the most sense to have it here but ASA
tech kind of owns that right now for at
least some regions so we're gonna take
this apart today and see how it actually
works cuz it's quite different from the
normal ASA tech coolers that we see from
basically the entire market before that
this video is brought to you by I fix
its brand new man to driver kit the
iFixit Manta kit is a universal repair
tool kit that includes 112 steel bits
redesigned from the ground up with
longer necks four four millimeter bits
allowing more precision when working on
components the $60 iFixit Manta kit has
everything from pentalobe drivers to why
drivers and standard bits learn more at
the link in the description below so a
few things with this we already tested
it and have a review in the works if you
want to check the review make sure you
subscribe to catch that because it'll go
up immediately after the teardown like
the next day but to go over the basics
it's a closed loop liquid cooler
functionally it's the same idea as all
the other ones however the radiator has
the tubes slightly differently
positioned so they're both offset to one
side typically you'd have one here and
one here but it looks like this might be
some kind of filler drain which we'll
look at momentarily the pump is right
here and it's on both sides you can see
there are four screws here which hold
the plate on which I'm assuming that'll
allow us to get access to the pump
hopefully without destroying things and
then obviously this takes place of some
of the thin stack so there are no
aluminum fins where this is and
the other thing to note is that this
happens to be centered right where the
hub of the fan is the hub of the fan is
basically a dead zone so if you think
about putting this fan once we get there
so if you think about putting this fan
but the cable was in my hair I had to
get it out if you put the fan here
you'll see that the pump is right behind
the hub you can't even really see the
pump probably or at least not too well
and that's because it's behind the hub
the hub is a dead zone so it's not
really pushing a ton of air through
there now there is some bleed out the
pump comes out a bit around the edges
towards the innermost part of the fan
blade so there there will be some loss
of air flow through that channel and
because we're not hitting fins
we're hitting just to block the
dissipation potential goes down so that
has some thermal implications mostly
negative ones for this design but
depending on how good the pump is it
might make up for it and depend on
what's in this block maybe they have a
bunch of micro fins or something like
that which would certainly help but what
we don't know is what is in here one
would assume there are micro fins on the
other side of the copper plate so we've
got two interesting things to take apart
today that's more or less the design one
more note I suppose is that this is an
RGB illuminated pump plate or well sea
view block plate like always so you get
the NZXT logos and then the pump itself
has a cable coming out of it kind of
annoyingly
right on the radiator but your fans got
a cable coming out of it anyway so you
can kinda strap them both out the same
side and then tie them together and
hopefully that reduces cable clutter but
it's certainly farther away from the
motherboard than being on a traditional
pump block so let's take this thing
apart this cooler is made by a supplier
known as a politic and it's a P al Tek
and they make a couple of coolers on the
market we've talked about them before
but this one is one that they make for
it now NZXT they make it for raid Max
and they make it for Xigmatek those are
the three I know of presently that use
this design there might be one more but
those are the three main ones so it's
not the first time this design has been
shown and the supplier is not
unique it is pretty it's it is one of
the smaller suppliers they're small
enough that they kind of go under the
radar for some of ASA Tech's legal
filings with their other designs but
they're big enough that they can get
clients like NZXT so that's a supplier
typically ASA tech makes most the
coolers on the market including the
other NZXT cracking coolers and they
also some of the other suppliers include
Kula torkoal idea if you prefer which
they make some of course there's
products so this is just a plate feels
like steel pretty light lightweight
metal plate over what looks to be the
the motor the electromagnet and motor
for the pump so once we get to the other
side you'll see how many poles it has
which are those coils that form the
electromagnet which is what causes the
impeller to move at this point we might
start leaking any second now
okay yep there's liquid in there alright
so there's our impeller so let's kind of
set this aside for a second while I
figure out what to do with the liquid
you see the liquid so that would be your
almost certainly propylene glycol and
then you've just there's a rubber gasket
around the outside it's clamped down
with it looks like just eight screws and
that's it all Phillips had and if you
can see in the chamber there we're not
full to the top obviously because there
was something displacing the water here
but the chamber looks pretty
straightforward so let's try and drain
this so we can look at it more closely
okay fortunately the gamers Nexus
anti-static mod mat is highly water
resistant as we've learned to doing this
if you want one of the mod mats it's
great for a build service it has PCIe
wiring guides and other diagrams on it
as cheat sheets it's a high quality
rubber and print service that's great
for PC building and is properly grounded
for electrostatic discharge and you can
grab one on stored on cameras nexus net
and once this cooler is done draining I
will finish my pitch for the mat so
there should be a lot more liquid in
here I think this will take a minute to
get all of it a day but it does look
like a standard propylene glycol mixture
what we don't know is how much is is
glycol and how much is distilled water
that impacts the cooling performance it
impacts the storage temperature
sometimes companies will go with a
higher glycol mixture so that they can
store their coolers and say negative 40
C whereas others might only target
negative 20 C and would use a lower
concentration of glycol higher distilled
water which improves your cooling
performance but reduces the storage
temperature or reduces it in a negative
way anyway I think that's mostly empty
there's probably there should probably
be more in there he had still leaking a
bit but that was not a lot of no that's
actually that's about right 100
milliliters so in our experience with
120-millimeter liquid coolers and even
now at 120 Zagat our experience is 120
is there typically 100 milliliters of
liquid which this is almost exactly that
after you account for the spillage so it
should be pretty much empty at this
point okay so chamber what we have is an
impeller that's one of the weakest
impellers I've seen in terms of design
this thing is not a great looking
impeller so it's a plastic blade on it's
a plastic five blade design on top of
the electromagnet and we've seen plastic
three blade designs for example but
these blades are exceedingly shallow
which I would explain why it spins at
such a high rpm over 3,000 rpm because
it's got to make up for the limited
impeller size and millimeters diameter
is not that large I don't know exactly
what it is I guess we could check 13
millimeters 13 millimeters for the hub
this we're gonna have to approximate
because none of them are directly across
roughly 25 millimeters for the impeller
size like blade blade so that's that is
one of the weakest impellers I've seen
it's a cheap plastic
I could definitely snap the blades if I
squeezed on it the to give you an idea
the sixth-generation ASA tech pumps that
Corsair is now using and soon other
vendors those switch to a an impeller
that looks an awful lot like the old
Dyna Tron impellers from an tech cooler
1250 previously a second we have footage
of this - you had a yellow three-pronged
impeller in there 4.5 and 5th gen and
4th gen products so this is I don't know
it's it does not impress me
as far as the rest I guess we can try
and see if this will come out that
solder joint yes that's a solder joint
this might not come out without breaking
stuff
okay so PCB is attached to wiring did I
break the wiring no shockingly did not
it's attached the coils but we've got
one two three four five six so six coils
for the electromagnet and let's get a
closer look at the rest of this thing so
at this point it's probably time to
remove the cold plate on the cooler and
that is gonna take it looks like either
torques or pentalobe which would be
really really annoying torques is fine
yes it's torch okay cause right it might
be some proprietary thin is gonna be
okay well this the screws are certainly
not in as tightly as they are with the
ACE attack products which is neither
good nor bad aside from being easier to
take apart
so here's the question do we have
microphones on the other side of that
cold plate and if you look at the sort
of outlines and indentations the answers
gonna be yes so what we have is this a
gasket it is so what we have is a rubber
gasket that presses against the micro
fins like that and that's for pressure
and flow reasons or directional gaskets
allow the flow to be manipulated so that
it's higher pressure through the areas
where you want higher pressure and so
that the flow is only entering or
exiting where you want it to do so so
we've got a cutout over the center
channel which I'm not sure currently
which side is in and which side is out
I'm not sure do they label it anywhere
of course not okay so we've gotten in
and out channel in here basically and
what I need to do now is see if there's
anything else to this because this
channel only goes well it probably goes
to about the split in the cap and then
above that is gonna be the NZXT probably
created a custom piece of view for their
lighting functionality they also created
one for the ASA tech coolers they were
the first company that ASA tech allowed
to create as custom of a lighting on PCB
solution as they did for the crack in
series X forty to fifty to sixty two so
that was remarkable about those I would
assume they've done it for the same for
this one it does have the same sort of
hue style color integration and they've
done the the best job in their class of
120 coolers for RGB LEDs not cooling is
a different story as you'll find out but
can I get any further in this not really
okay so there's the top part of those
channels nothing special there there's
not even liquid in this chamber and
there shouldn't be any screws here tiny
screws that's going to be for
dismounting the barbs I guess we can see
how the barbs are constructed as well
they are 90 degree rotational Barb's but
that's really for the most part all you
need to know about them they might be
held together some piano wire or
something and then here's your NZXT
looks like NZXT made RGB LED board with
an st electronics controller on it there
are a couple more screws in here that
would take apart the infinity mirror
it's not really worth doing to be honest
because it's not gonna teach us anything
but if you wanted to replace for example
if you wanted to rotate the NZXT logo on
here to be a different orientation then
you would basically not do any of the
other stuff I just did and you would
just remove this cap from the body
that's the only step you'd do it
wouldn't expose water to anything and
then you would take these screws out and
you can flip the logo around which some
people asked about for the original
crack in Syria so that's how you do it
on this one that looks like a costume
NZXT design though for that board so
that's the teardown of this thing
basically core components there's a
gasket as always covering a set of micro
fins
I can't measure the density here but it
doesn't look that different from the
a-stack designs maybe fewer of them
maybe a smaller cold plate pumps in the
body of the radiator as illustrated
earlier and then the rest is over here
this is not a pump block it's really
just a block that water goes through so
there's actually no real conduction
going on up here at the pump level not
much anyway so what's happening is
you've got some conduction obviously
through the cold plate most of the
majority of it taking energy away from
the in the form of heat away from the
CPU and then as it goes through the pump
it or well the pump is pulling liquid
through the tubes so I should say so as
it goes through these tubes and down the
radiator tubes as normally it's hitting
the these tube lines in here getting
conducted away by the fins which then
the fan dissipates it so
pretty straightforward design except the
pump is on the radiator instead of on
top of the CPU definitely interesting to
look at perhaps not the best way to do
it but you do have to give them credit
for trying to do something different
without violating or potentially
violating a Stax patent depending on how
they feel about it or how a stack feels
about it because they're definitely
partners too so that's obviously
concerned not too many other ways to do
it this is probably not the best one the
impeller is certainly a lower grade
impeller than I'd like to see the pump
is a bit small to be fair so you can't
fit much different than there than this
but you can't really make the pump much
bigger either because then you're
exiting the fan hub which they're kind
of already doing for your only deadzone
size that's forgiving and and taking up
more dissipation area where the fins
would be so the best solution after that
might be a pump attached to the tank on
the radiator but then you have mounting
support limitations in cases cases that
say they can support 240 won't be able
to support 240 with the pump on the tank
if it's already barely supporting 240
normally so not a lot of options anyway
very interesting cooler it's 100 bucks
for this one we can probably salvage it
if I don't know if it's worth it but we
can probably put it back together and if
you want more as always subscribe for
more the review of this cooler with
thermal data is coming probably tomorrow
after this one uploads obviously
intestine was down before the teardown
and go to store that carries excess net
to pick up one of the mod mats that you
saw used in this video or one of our 3d
teardown cubes like this one here with a
three dimensional GM logo and of course
