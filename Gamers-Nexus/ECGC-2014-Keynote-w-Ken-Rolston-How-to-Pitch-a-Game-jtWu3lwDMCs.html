Evangelist member of that wordsmithing
gangs which is a new effort that goes
hand-in-hand with our subscription
program plan we're just really excited
to be here and you know just participate
in this event I was asked to do an
introduction for Ken Ralston and that
was really exciting to me because I've
always worked closely over the years I
played the heck out of our mind and
pelvis goals a little bit of it working
on the back one day but going even
farther back and I'm training my age a
lot of the tabletop
you know strategy kind of strategy for
injuries that grew up with on the other
hand in front of that community and the
lesson for me there I think is you know
there are fundamentals of game design
forget if it's you know running on a
computer or an xbox bar on a tabletop
but there's certain fundamentals of
storytelling and design that make the
experience fun
and this man was just just helped define
that entire process that discipline that
I cracked if you will so without further
ado I'd like to introduce
I've got cheap gave my price - that's
the difference okay eight pitches you
now basically understand what the title
is this is me internationally celebrated
game designer that's what I teach
everybody getting parent like little
animals when I introduce myself
memorable meaning old and dangerous from
the age of paper pencil game a game
which you could not win in which the
great joy was to lose all time and die
and then be reborn into clone and then
also tales of the Arabian Nights eight
or telling story hella game then I
didn't were winded oblivion a number of
other like single role-playing classics
and a noir
reckoning for big huge games that's my
major claim to fame and now I am the
most important thing there visionary
evangelist and mentor and that would be
part of the context of what I'll be
talking about for game bitches
I was hired as a visionary evangelist
and mentor you want that job I assure
you it's going to be very hard to get
something a long time but essentially it
means I didn't do a lot of teaching and
selling and also the visionary part
really hard to express that basically
it's the guys who get people to go into
the wilderness without enough food water
and not mention to them that they like
died it's like Crusades and coke
original things like that very glorious
and just don't forget a lot of the time
people
come back I'm from one of the seven they
do this I think I'm a righteous old dude
at this point I surrounded the game
industry for about 30 years
I entered paper-and-pencil gaming in my
30s I entered computer gaming in my 40s
so it's never too late to make a mistake
on this skip ad scale one thing I want
to do is a caveat I am two kinds of
internationally celebrated game designer
mostly I'm a narrative designer I don't
there's a number some stuff like that I
can't do math I can't tell you how long
I've been married to be complicated to
me and role-playing game designer that
means I design the games that are
narrative in their core and every way
and also far too big for anybody here to
even think about working in is there
anybody here working in a role-playing
game development right right now okay
pardon me the tiny number because it's
just impossible cost way too much money
but nonetheless my knowledge will kind
of communicate to you in some way that
your violence may Meredith okay the
roadmap of what you understand that I am
NOT responsible with your storytellers
on when I give you over the year story
to tell the person I act as that was a
two-act nightmare
it's about any pitches and how as a
mentor evangelist and visionary I was
using game pitches as a way to incubate
in projects and also new people a new
design flavors that turbine and Warner
brother and then the second half will be
about what I discovered about what I did
when I started teaching that's always
very exciting than they'd up I was
hired to do something that nobody had
done beforehand I made it up and then
I'll give me an idea what it was like
before I learned anything at the
beginning of 18 months and then I'll
give you an idea of what happens when
you actually find out what you're doing
then I'll talk about a few models that
give you some illustrate illustrating
examples of the vast abstract shoes that
I'll be talking about then I'm going to
talk about something at the end cause
we're closet dramas because one of the
problems is is that I've told you that
I'm a linear designer and reliable but
why most of them have landmarks
scattered you're here mask to remind you
that I'm totally irresponsible I will
not tell whether your story just like
anymore or whether it is Libyan you have
a main quest but I promise you that's
not important
what's important is what you see off way
in the distance and that also that
expresses the complexity the end of the
package but the simplicity never does
the simplicity makes you feel confident
that you know what you're going to get
you're gonna get to the end of your path
probably not dead
that's not a visionary building which
type thing but the landmarks again that
one is supposed to be on the end of this
line is a reminder that it ends in
tragedy sometimes so part of my job is
you're supposed to hear what I'm telling
you but you're also supposed to look at
what I'm doing more than what I'm
telling you because I'm trying to give
you exterior eyes some of my thought
process and how I go about making my
visionary efforts and my tragic mistakes
and how they kind of get integrated into
growth and development okay so what is a
gaming pitch this is American
tweeted and I gave pictures of basically
an idea and unique game ideas are the
big games but they have a very specific
meaning in mind in three days
fountains of money occur when you make a
successful game pitch and that's what
most people think of game pitches are
and that's why it's hired there to come
up with game vision because they wanted
fountains of money there's more to it
than that it's a game that a game design
level what a great pitch does is it
tells you what you want to do it
expresses what relationship you want to
have with your users in the very
beginning and if you're doing your
homework your game pick will be just as
useful as it was when you're selling it
the first two executives as it will be
when it reaches your user that
continuity of vision is something we're
going to be looking for so let me tell
you what I originally came up with I've
been doing a game plan for a very long
time so I thought this would be a
perfectly perfect process for the
incubation process it a turbine we would
call four pitches and we can call not
just from game designers but from
everyone marketing sales QA they would
submit a premise which we'll talk about
later and we would go through trance and
revision collectively and
they would make a PowerPoint if they
didn't stop at the premise and then they
would do a presentation and I'll tell
you that that presentation was aimed
only at executives and that we would
make a review we'd say which things are
good or bad and then we would decide
what we're going to begin to go into
pre-production so that would be the
whole process in theory make up some
pitches make sure they don't suck in one
document make sure they don't suck a
larger document present that using those
two documents and then start playing
games that turned out not to be the way
it was but let's put in a few minutes
okay let's talk about we're on the
second step court attorney the premise
is fine
by the way these are pictures frightened
mentees being mentored by the buzz
within fear so purpose is like a film
treatment it's like a two page executive
summary film treatment meaning if you're
gonna make a film and you don't want to
give a total screenplay with a executive
cuz he won't read it anyway you give him
at least that treatment so he has a
record of what he heard and there were a
couple examples that I have created in
1995 the very first computer game
company I want to I said okay where's
the think of like a screenplay that I do
in order to start the games and they
looked at the gap drawed with
indifference and confusion because there
was no and still is no accepted format
to start a gaming so I just invented one
on this bottom 20 years ago before I
knew what I was doing these are the
things that I used just these last two
three years because since nobody has a
or shared for that I decided never try
that I have two examples here these were
written in 1995 they have various
structural units which I'll go over in a
little more detail the titles and the
imaginative entry are two elements of
the way I get started and what I really
want to have happen is to have some the
title has to catch and something some
fragment of imagine of entry and this
was what they would look like didn't
spare enough for the title and they
would have a whole snatch my thing like
a whole quote in a magazine something
that you find it that lying out of the
margins and then I give you a high
concept something you usually hear you
like see what's give me a name of a MOBA
League of Legends meets Harry Met Sally
or whatever something like that so
whatever it is it's a high concept
America inconceivable it is that's well
that's the simple way you would started
and then there's a section which says
who you are and what you're doing which
by the way if you're game designers when
you this up you don't remember this
you have to do this this is really the
notion is going to be that a pitching
process creation this is a great way to
teach you how to be a non-sucking game
designer not that you don't know how to
do all these things but you generally
forget a checklist to make sure you did
them all and you may often be in a
fervent state of creation where you've
forgotten the other three or four or
five things you need on your checklist
also you're either face roughly what
does it look like when you're playing
that could also substitute some case f
genre your gameplay this would explain
briefly and apparent record so what
we're actually doing what you like and
you need to have gameplay premiere the
game mood to me because I'm an
internationally celebrated narrative
designer it's always important to me to
have those elements of narrative that I
think are more emotional so I wanted to
know that's what the the interface
between you and your user is through the
mood above the thing that you do and you
want to want to touch something in it
you didn't know you want to know what
emotion it is you're touching and then I
would talk just because I would be
talking to people who had money I want
that the shower money on them have
roughly about how big an audience I was
that and how I thought we would have
some way to fund it and back in 1995
there were some very simple ways to make
money there are different ways to make
money now but you would have to fill
that in on your own and then something
that I didn't know about this came in
about the 12th month of our design
process we added another section called
emulation target which I have to say is
the most important tool if you're going
to talk to executives because they don't
want to know and in the detail see
because they're not developers in those
cases I've been lucky enough back for
mess up and be huge they were developers
the people artwork before so when I was
talking about something exciting in a
design sense they understood what I was
talking about they've got the references
what executives are not going to be able
to do is to make those connections so if
you can say oh it's just like clash of
clans it's the good thing about that
that meant your designer actually had an
idea of what the game would play and
felt like is the bad side of that if
it's a game no one's ever seen before
you can't make that emulation target so
it does place constraints on what you
can come up with and we can discuss that
there's a broader sense later this is a
landmark this is where we swept off the
road into the high grass occasionally
and it's because I think of game
development as a clown car moving
through tall blond grass so so far are
trying to impress in some way how
deliberate intelligent it is what it
really is is very very creative people
very hotly energized to go somewhere in
a big hurry and there's just no way to
know where they're going they're going
to go very very fast and there's
accidents are very lightly so
cheerfulness is really the most
important
okay
know what planking I can't think that
the plank is then anyway
power points are what the industry uses
the way you're going to find out
something about power points is by
looking at them guess what you can't do
you can't put the power points because
once the company does one that's an
intellectual property they're going to
guard so we're going to talk a little
bit about how we find ways to get around
that problem you're going to study the
existing ones when you can find them me
I provide a starter template it is so
incredibly non detailed but I'll give
you an example of vesting it started as
just as you want to start off with some
form and then you can start making
progress with you checked off things on
your checklist you want to then share
your models if you have 12 people who
submitted pitches they're going to learn
more from each other than they'll ever
learn from me partly number one because
I'm a limited resource and I only know
so much about game development and game
design whereas if you look at that you
steal from one another's materials in
order to make your stuff better you're
always trying to compete in to win
because winning is everything isn't that
right
I didn't hear that but curdling cheer
that I expected and then you're gonna
steal one another styles of tricks and
if wishing want part director alone but
I will warn you if you're a designer and
you don't have entry-level art skills
that doesn't be making art and stealing
art and using it using it in the graphic
design you need to be able to make maps
please understand that anything I have
to say to game designers that's learn
how to do things that aren't purely
about words otherwise you're a dead man
use Excel use a freehand or what good
lord
corral draw other primitive things with
nobody all of you dies and the odd thing
is I found often in marketing because
they're nice to have our point they
wanted to start with a PowerPoint and
not with a premise I wouldn't let them
start but I wouldn't force them to make
the text a thing because what it is is
the checklist they had to do the logical
deconstruction of what they wanted to do
they only had to us they didn't have
understanding and the only way I could
prove to them they didn't have
understanding as would say you can't
fill out a premise that's just a warning
to anybody tries to do it this is basic
one THQ is dead after all as you know
but I burned their HQ and the actual
gate premise format that they gave us
there's only seven slides and one of the
slides we have maybe three different
slides built into it so it's a total of
ten slides that would be your basic one
that the simple thing is just what the
hell is it then comes the hard part
why should I care actually if you've got
that part right
then I'm ready to start working on
getting the polished details with you
and then this is for that your audience
partly talking about who are your users
and partly
about whether this amount of money come
from your feature set or points both
points those you love words don't love
paragraphs should stop glowing parents
is one other things that people don't
like with their executives are in fact
of their engineers or anybody it's used
to technical documents they want to know
what's important and if they're confused
about what that thing is what it means
they'll ask you so you want to build
that document to elicit questions not to
answer them because if they answer the
questions they'll have lost the will to
read or to live and then depending on
whether you're in a narrative game or in
a non narrative and have some sense of
progression so you if you don't have a
three-act structure you'll have an Earl
introduction mid game and then an elder
game instructor trying to get to my idea
how the player progresses and then you
want to have pictures and for me by the
way they've got the artists to do
something sometimes that crying that's
fine that I steal my concept better
I steal us from trailers for movies I
steal it for magazines I steal it from
companies we're writing so that's
essentially all simple slide template
that they were given and then we made an
offer pitches in the process begin this
is another landmark this was supposed to
be a narrative of jazz talk and I
chicken down but what I was going to do
is I was going to put a red ukulele here
and never reference it until somewhere
in the middle of the thing and that was
to be a physical representation of how
something can be presented in the
background it becomes part of your
narrative
what happens for that it can be symbolic
in some way it'll be theatrical because
everybody sees Jesus is read and say
something it's going to be important and
it's all by itself it's very distracting
to them this is going to be an
illustration of one aspect my product
creates a pitch concept is I always
design for hundred percent of the
content and then I throw away at archive
three hundred and fifty percent this is
one of the pieces this gets rr5 for
development for a few things so number
one that foreshadowed my future
development you'll have something if I
come back you'll want to know what worse
is ukulele where's the review clearly
but also that surviving fifty percent
you want to turn it into a new percent
awesome by that point you know the fifty
percent that doesn't stop and you want
to make everything look like that fifty
moving back to our structure we've gone
there four point four what we discovered
when we were looking for wisdom and
truth and they were unanticipated
lessons of benefits because ignorance
has that virtue when you start doing
something in ignorance you will
eventually learn something and it's
always exciting
sometimes what producing but when you're
in the wilderness is starving to death
you learn very quickly you focus on
water you focus on the food and not
roasting well the great things we did by
accident never imagined doing it we were
going to present to our executives but
then we said hey we've got powerpoints
awesome why don't we gather everybody in
the company in a room like this and have
a son that's the best of all other
pitches
it was great in a million ways because
it wasn't just designers it was people
from all different crafts also I'm in a
multi development team studio so
from different projects came together
and then if you get them excited they
start talking at the end of it so your
first job first thing that makes it
awesome is you're talking to your
friends and you don't want to suck
therefore you make your PowerPoint
really awesome and also when your
friends look at you and say wow does it
suck
I couldn't play that game or you say oh
that's stupid you couldn't possibly do
that partly let me translate that
that's too visionary that's too
innovative that's but it was great that
was the way we engage designers and
programmers and marketing weasels be
everybody wanting to get involved so
that public display of the studio
mission at a top level of your managing
companies or something like that
that is a really powerful more housing I
hated and despised our studio executive
Aziz kept talking about how good this
would be for morale and then later as a
oh yeah you were so totally right this
is not just an artistic thing this is
about understanding what your people do
and it's giving people a chance to do
something creative how many people get
the getting game maker few but a lot of
people got to give their idea and have
it presented the people that was totally
awesome
we originally this is this is the
technical level
what an idiot am i is how I learned I
originally thought we were just talking
about two documents because I love
documents in the narrative designer I'm
really a writer who number that our
writer so I want document
but it was what it really is is I forgot
to somehow that I used to believe when I
was a kid and what my students is when I
was teaching high school all the way
that literature equal to text that the
book that you read Rebecca of Sunnybrook
farm that had to be exactly the way it
was the Game of Thrones books that had
to be that way never occurred them that
the author was making choices so the
important thing to realize which I
learned back in college from weed
Rosenblatt is that literature is the sum
of the text and the reader it's the
response of the reader that makes
literature and if you forget about that
you were a hot day man so it's that when
I was trying to put together idea of
game issues so my new is involved and my
concept is that it's about the premise
and the PowerPoint but the important
thing about the premise of the
PowerPoint is that they generated
frequently asked questions you would
step in you do a five-minute
presentation to an executive and then
the thing that we didn't know was
important happened the executives
wouldn't ask questions and then we would
look at planned on Thursday totally
that's what everything was about because
the executive was telling you what he
wanted to hear not what you wanted to
tell and then that's the most important
thing that you could possibly do so all
are we
process a dry runs where we did
presentations for Hospital audiences
that is training hospital audiences your
Frank's we're trained to be rudely and
adorably mean to you and that generated
how holy I don't have the answer
that question for this game sucks oh
yeah I need to know that you make this
list and then what that does is it
allows the presenter to go in and
deliver for five minutes and then wait
patiently like this like you're
challenging the executive to ask a
question they he asks a question and a
few ask answer in such a way that you
stop it then he has never will roll
resistant they says well what about this
other thing it's always a little more
tentative because if it is a score the
first question he's going to go a little
slightly if you get through three
questions and every one of your answers
fuels that you know what the hell you're
doing he no longer has that he has the
moral and emotional will to resist but
at that point you at least gotten across
the sill now one thing I want to suggest
about how this works is we discovered
that there's a certain container
capacity that PowerPoint should only
contain 1% of what your project is about
and the executive capacity is only about
1% of was your total project is and the
new user capacity this the thing we
didn't understand yeah I can't explain
it to a user simply it's not a very good
idea has to be in that one small
QuickTime 1% and the trick is the
visionary genius has to be prepared for
when questions are asked or to ask that
the actors
he knows 450 percent of everything and
by the way that means you have to set
yourself a very high standard of having
done your homework you do not peacock
that in front of your audience when you
present it you don't try to show that
you're extremely smart you let them be
smart we show something that's
intriguing and let them demonstrate
their intelligence and then you stuff
their intelligence right now the threat
to the power the mission you've done in
your home by the way hand waving right
now how hard that is to do everything
everything I do here is and waiting how
hard it is but I'm just trying to give
you a really simple idea that you didn't
imagine so what you really need to
understand is that the presentation is
just a way to get executive questions
ideal is also a way to get user
questions when you present it to a whole
studio the questions you've got any
different questions than you get from an
executive very often they'll be user and
developer directed and useful at that
level and then you want to reveal your
depth of genius and project your project
mastery and then three great spontaneous
answers that that's the goal you want to
win you want to have three three sprites
and move to the next level so in a more
enlightened sense what you should also
realize it should recapitulate the
entire evolution of your project you
should begin worrying with your pitch
that you craft together with your
friends and then you have to get past
your execs which will also have to get
the buy-in of your studio colleagues and
then when your project team is coming
together you need to take that
and it has to be been a 1% tiny
understandable I'm excited to perform
and then finally that form has to move
directly into the use you want that
continuity a vision that's what vision
stuff is about and again and waiting the
whole problem how difficult that is I
have a dream of one vision moving from
pitch to user I've never actually been
able to do it but more when I think I
came as close I had a 10 item thing that
I plan to use burly with the publicity
and journalists and of the ten things 9
and the more sensible the third thing
was something like text management or
journals of anybody that who played more
will discover we made the worst journal
in modern history and somehow from
government to care enough that so I you
know even if my best effort you should
fail at anything like this but it's a
great high conception also GDC 2014
fabulous presentation can't remember the
guys then Greg something or other
defining project vision he tracks the
Saints Row one through four totally good
reading for you I may not be able to
understand it without that hopefully
we'll have the video someday right now
you have a power here's some other
things just quickly it's great to have a
learning community of intellectual
dissipation it's nice to argue about any
design ideas together that brings you
together we found awesome people who
were way outside of their game design
comfort zones who were awfully created
oddly enough very opening marketing and
in community there were people who know
users it turns out you often don't know
the users you know your text you don't
even name you like but you don't really
know what the people like to be using
this was a volunteer program I can't
tell you how important that was these
were people who would take time out and
they would be over the weekend they
would put together pitches and they
would come in and peacock to those
pitches they felt so good and by the way
they have the moral high ground they're
not working for money therefore you can
kind of trust them in a meaningful way
there was a lot of innovation and I want
to tell you that that's not what I hear
when you have executives involved and
maybe not a good idea when you have
users involved because people like what
they're used to
and I'm the I'm not using executives in
a solitary way I'm using all of us we
want to see what we're familiar with so
what I replace that with as a political
gesture having taken its study in the
Republican Party Lawrence had a handle
management you you can argue about
innovation but nobody can argue that
whether they want freshness or not they
want it can be fresh so you can use that
word pretty regularly and that the more
like by the way the so expected our
people when we gave that idea that they
started making things that were
innovative under the name of freshness
so we had to give them emulation targets
to curb their creativity and waiting
that's one of the details that I'm not
going to talk about is how broader range
of creativity and competence there were
in these pitches we mostly try not to
evaluate whether they were
really great ideas or even makeable if
they excited a user fantasy because my
job when I came there was to represent
the user I'm supposed to say I care
about what people really want not what's
possible not what we can afford but what
people really want them to find our way
to get there oh yeah learning how to
make pitches it's really great they just
recently we had a guy he brought me his
first pitch two weeks ago went to the
dry run process and by the time he ended
he went from a place where he would just
like not at all good and then when he
stood in front of the executives he just
says you know I'm really scared and he
was so at ease with that and he was so
ready that he charmed everybody in the
room
he just went from zero to 60 in two
seconds of fabulous mentoring vector for
me this is great this is a great way for
me to push my design
agenda on the group as a whole and
through its opinion creatives the people
who have the energy to go out and find
things on their own in any population
you'll find out of 170 may have a 5% or
10% who are actually going to make
change we're gonna make things done you
get excited about going in the
wilderness with that nefeli water going
on pilgrimages the doctor worked out so
we were able to put together we did a
lot of research I kept sharing your
research with them they share research
would be they talk meets up and we
shared those references in powerpoints
and emails now what I'm not going to
tell you about what I'm hand waving is
how much
a nightmare and a disappointment to a
lot of humans number one some people are
perfectly in the abstract willing to
imagine that they're winners and losers
but it hurts not to be a better and it
hurts to become you to be Eminem
the Sundance Film Festival and not have
the best day if you don't feel
comfortable that you were and you're in
an entertainment industry in a
performative it's industry here at the
wrong industry you have to love the
suffering that comes from not being
great until you get to be totally great
it's a very difficult thing to deal with
it I happen to feel that that's one of
the positive things learning to mediate
that experience but it's also it's just
painful for people involved and you have
to be an enlightened manager like me to
help people do that and that's that loss
of person 100 when you make a picture
it's owned by Warner Brothers you got to
get over that and I'm often told people
before they give in the pitch and I say
if you think this was something really
awesome you don't want to give it over
to Warner Brothers keeping working on it
near declining years when you get fired
or drift or go to prison okay so this is
how we revised the process we spent
never poured dry runs and back
development in there and then the back
the ground bag presentations came into
the executive presentations so that's
essentially what it wasn't is up a
fragrant cloud computing design and the
lightness that is the
everybody to feel warm and fuzzy and
educated and also that's a reference
with the Cloud of Unknowing a work of
anonymous work of Christian neo plays
and like tonic mysticism and that's just
cuz I want to show up because I was a
college ok and now we're going to move
on to some ideas that I would like to
share with you four ways to use the big
primal process number one game pitches
for narrative jams why should we have
game jams that are just about making
great games
let's have game games that are about
great game ideas something that you can
probably work on if you don't have the
technical skills you'll still be to
teach in many cases to bring this sort
of thing I think it'd be totally awesome
I will say that making a great
presentation is not easy but they can
create game is not easy those two things
might be worth what I want to tell
anybody it's got a game development
program university or a trade school or
something like that use this idea
properly it has a small technical
footprint and will allow people to get
involved and to learn things before they
have entry-level skills in the technical
stuff and it also teaches this
presentations important and also making
an emotionally effective an audience
directly in a presentation that's
something you want to figure out how to
do how to put the hook into an audience
and then share references in the design
community I want to make a case for that
being something that we ought to share
and use as ways to stimulate new bad
ideas okay here's another one of those
landmark things I stole this from a
Gordon wall from GBC talk long time ago
one highlight is the most important
thing here through the pitch process the
most important thing was being cheerful
when things were going to hell in a
handbasket when you're working really
hard and I want to say that that's
probably that plus boundless resources
of energy is what's really important for
a game design because what you have to
do is you have to fail fail fail fail
and succeed you have to be trying to do
things that are too hard for you to do
there actually is one place on perfectly
willing to share my - the meat ax and
llama documents and references beer over
IP is actually on that website great
speaking did a humorous pitch a way that
you could deliver beer across the
internet for the ball but it's an
example that our best barrier pitch but
where you really want to go see game
pitches calm which has some number of
really interesting game problems you're
going to notice on that site though the
most important thing is the difference
between the pitch that was made
was made for example by track pitch
document which is available there looks
nothing like the Bioshock game you play
it's an interesting it show us vision
but and but you're going to say what
were these for this this one is old
doesn't play state had a plan state is
like a 40 page document that captures
the term perfectly tone is mood it's
probably my favorite example for one
paper figuring out a very very difficult
game design and getting it a 442 they
work perfect before you start to go into
consumption this isn't a game that
almost certainly will never be made
because of God my king premise was based
on the idea that safe decided you know
he wanted to do something about the
apocalypse and there was a poor staff
work among the demons they thought that
the seals were not seals to or anything
like that but they thought they were
harbor seals so they invented seven
giant seals and float on lament columns
of white that caused an destruction I
just want that illustration to me ya
know rag on it an example this is from
my private things before Kingdoms of
Amalur was made a game as best ended was
imagine that I'll give you the first
four or five slides of something that I
used very early on to say this is
roughly what the game would be like
the art is stolen from a first video
trailer of Witcher that you'll see
another piece marked like that from them
with your thing in a few seconds that's
the only piece to that that's really
pieces of concept part in there so you
can tell that kind of Nazi said you know
they're bad so this is kind of a next
expression of what the conflict is and
now that's the packaging you return you
pick up what your father left off and he
is remembered as a cake a hero and a
traitor and the whole thing there says
your dad was known by many names
how will you be remembered so that is a
way to set the emotional look up what if
you realize it was going to be about
family and it's also about people who
are good at making choices which seem
good and which turn out really badly
like that your whole nation of
exterminated linden and then you come
back and you've got a problem not your
dad's totally you're gonna have to do
something completely different
your reputation at the beginning of the
game will be bad and we'll have to
ameliorate in some ways it persists so
that would be the end of us there's the
first five slides which are used to give
a sense of what it was and involved into
a thing which I called the home page we
didn't because we probably would have
done more and and the home pages were
institutionalized this way to
communicate and we were making a
narrative progress but I added a bunch
of slides good and used it for the first
term for the whole company could give an
idea of what kind of a vision we'd
wanted for the game so we used pieces
concept art to give you a sense of what
the places we're going to be and this
was going to have a new concept you when
started in the west where the river
river is and rocks on to your way across
the cities and you would end up over at
the choke point at the end and the idea
was that as you progress across the map
you could tell you we're coming to a
climax because the walls of the balance
of a valley river closing in so it was
an attempt to exteriorize the dramatic
structure in the landscape area just
pictures of bad things
thank you these are people you can talk
to and the cheap trick is you come back
from across the sea out of Exile and
we've assigned you two of the guards of
your father's guard or totally useless
and that kind of makes your situation
even more pathetic and adorable they can
at least tell you what they're your
information kind of this early in the
narrative exposition and idea what
places are going to look like and then I
made this in a 3d thing that's my first
3d thing and yet I thought that was
awesome and then my tradition is having
great features and always having less
than that or more than that never
exactly happy because it was that sense
it was going to evolve if I have blitz
and great things and they
for that's what we want okay and then we
close off of this and that would be the
direction to go off and dig around in
places where they would find the game
this is trying to figure out a better
way to do this is modern kinda just
messing with this I would start off with
this slide and then I would put its
context in a single slide that could
compress that whole idea the first three
or four slides so as Brecker you should
always be thinking about ways that you
could do use compression because time is
money okay
is it their normal internal thing turned
it into a home pitch is a printer
later on it was used to sell us to THQ
so there's math amounts of money but not
those slides the process of making
pitches we kept evolving the pitches the
pitches developed over time so expect to
have that discipline in your development
team if you want to not suck okay
another landmark this is just the truth
I mean saying lucky you saying what's
really important is for you to be crazy
if you are not crazy you cannot get
started as an artist I don't know how
you get crazy everybody's going to have
their own way sometimes it's the
solitude in the urn room sometimes it's
talking in other people's love it's like
holding for large crowds showing
pictures of them but you need to have a
picture like that somewhere in your
folder structure that you can go back to
you remind
not crazy enough the new working okay
now we're going to talk a little bit
about that closet dramas the child
within your to express itself me even I
got to do so many things I have no
reason to complain you know I've been so
happy with the games that I've made
every way nonetheless I'm not content I
want something more safe ken wants to
trick some massive multi-billion dollar
triple-a RPG development studio and do
indulging my artistic impulses perfectly
safe and almost certainly disasters and
self-destructive dr. Tate this is not
going to happen may occur to you that no
company's going to find that attractive
bitch but that's what this trial inside
is crying for Frank Zappa and the
present-day artist refuses to die I feel
that way and what this is all about
little bit there but these are going to
be some palette chests or whatever the
thing I'm looking for people ask me what
is my dream name and I'm ashamed that I
came into the question it never would
occur to me in heaven during and it's
stupid in this industry where you know
having a dream game you need to have an
infinite amount of money and everybody
who is smart and I think all those
people are smart even harder than the
money if you need to know them all and
you need the trick them into doing what
you want
coming into the wilderness also I
described something called a closet
drama it's a drama then it's written but
never intended to be performed and it
might be
we perform because it wouldn't be too
expensive to make the stats but it also
could be just because it's too dreary
and salt craving for anybody to
deliberately want to pay money to see I
think I was looking for is a concept of
an architectural folly and the thing in
the Wikipedia thinking appealed it has
no purpose other than as an ornament
eccentric in design and bakery there's a
high level of irony to my left here and
also Mel's pretty the Latin phrase for
drug commercial potential I deliberately
want a strain against the bonds of the
Carll commercialism but I love this
little quote from the album what freaks
now like when you turn to lucid or
recordings give you at one o'clock in
the morning on $500 worth of great and
percussion instruments that sounds
awesome
so this is going to be
it's gonna be my presentation to you
this is no speech this is just
I don't want them to have be able to win
because they're dumb and stupid that's
what people are supposed to be but I
want them somehow at the end each to
have their redeeming recognition that
they're bad and my ideal villain is a
novella like villain who's got a great
style and
knows the beasts screwed up so that's my
dream you know as you can see this is
not very promising for a potential thing
but what I would like to do is to
propose to you that we could do stuff
like that this is a barrage from a paper
and pencil game Club when you look on
the character sheet most Dungeons &amp;amp;
Dragons games is where are my axes and
illusions this has descriptions of your
personality you have numbers for your
characters and a for example like what
great staff word sedative basically what
it comes down to is what's wrong with
these people making aren't there things
that they've got a lot of ambition and
poor impulse control that's a perfect
dramatic situation and in both Game of
Thrones and the King Arthur you have
lots and lots of people on the same
stage with terrible desire to do the
right thing and sometimes are one thing
but they want to do things I also have
terrible terrible judgment and they all
research through each other
possibly when I say terrible judgments
maybe it's the human condition maybe you
can buy the same home but in that case I
think that's very dramatic passions are
about what we knew that we do not
control but which controls us and this
is just the thing
all the different kinds of outcomes to
get if you had a terrific thing and you
really had a critical success with B you
test your lustful trade are you really
must and you see whatever you say or and
anytime you say I'm gonna do anything
for a woman you know that's going to
generate drama on the other hand if you
really hope you're a female and you
fumble and you say you're really
suspicious of what I hear that might
give you a power that nobody else do you
are actors that I can't get mad there's
some other examples of ways you can go
about Richard if you feedback before you
make your choice give you some kind of
idea tells you when you made it
important to us give me some feedback on
it also which are - I think they they do
a lot of draft dramatic branching Eddy
death which is awesome the guys need
them dead and therefore doesn't have any
downstream handling or he's alive and he
appears in a single episode and all he
does is he has a convenience like he
holds a ladder for you when you go up to
the place or he takes an arrow in the
knee walk again does another would this
this fall branch inspect brought to the
highest level of artistic elegance and
I'm not gonna let you read that I forget
at the end of the day I want to start
off I think the other thing like this
work
guys they're gonna be your bad guys I
would love to tell that story where you
start if you've got somebody you're
sympathetic don't kill them off in the
first scene find a way to keep them a
lot totally not possible practically
speaking but it is my job to get you and
myself to keep struggling as best I can
by the way this has been going on for a
long time some of you may have noticed
but the great game design challenge
seared series and PDC I think it was
maybe was will right who had the Emily
Dickinson license and did a game design
basically on that and also worth looking
at here in the Eagle game design
challenge for casual connect is a an
attempt to figure out how to make
minecraft free-to-play you should take a
look at these if you're studying
examples of gaming pages this is my
closing exhortation to you eff is not
for failure f is for fun move forward
and and this is the one thing
the a rule in development I can attest
to other than one other to which I have
met it was everything is always better
when it's bonfire I don't think you can
have opinions about truth obviously true
okay that's all I have to say</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
