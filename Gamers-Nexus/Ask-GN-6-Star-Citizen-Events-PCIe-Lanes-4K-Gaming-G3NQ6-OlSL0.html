tonight and we're doing another ask GN
episode I think we're on episode 6 now
and we have some pretty good questions
this week that I'm excited to dive into
and all those are technical related
except for one the one that is not is
about the recent Star citizen drama for
a lack of a more concise term so through
Reddit and elsewhere I received the
question are you planning on covering
the current happenings with star citizen
and that's specifically relating to the
escapists allegations you could say
against the star citizen team the cloud
Imperium games team so just to get this
out of the way right away at the top of
the show here no we will not be covering
it immediately there is a chance we will
cover it in the future but not at this
time and the reason for that is because
when I started this site in 2008 it was
my objective to really dive deep talking
about content and how Hardware works how
it interacts with games how games are
made how they utilize that Hardware and
occasionally we'll just talk about games
not really into Hardware at all but the
point is all of the content at least for
the most part especially recently tries
to go deep and talk about things with
which we have hands-on experience or
verifiable validated evidence things
that we can talk to experts on and in
the case of the current events with a
certain media outlet and the cloud
Imperium games team we just I don't feel
like we have enough data to report on
and I feel like all it does is add fuel
to the fire without necessarily adding
meaningful commentary so if if I don't
feel like what I'm saying has any weight
or usefulness in the current environment
the current atmosphere of the games and
hardware industries it's really not
worth diving into from from my
perspective so hopefully that makes
sense we will not be covering it at this
time as details emerge that could change
the current standing of the claims from
from The Escapist side from
here in game side are very serious they
have very serious implications for the
game itself obviously they have serious
implications for the game industry for
journalists in the industry how this
type of thing is handled in the future
so it's it's not something that's an
item to make light of it's not a movie
to watch it's very serious and we want
to treat it with respect in that regard
so I'm staying away from it for now
so that stated let's get into the fun
hardware questions that I am pretty
pretty excited to talk about here the
first one is fairly straightforward
human livestock asks my question is what
is holding GP is back with 4k gaming is
it weak GPU cores seems like memory
bandwidth doesn't help much so starting
with the end of that question first
memory bandwidth doesn't help much is an
interesting statement because you can
point out the new video cards using HBM
the fury X for example and see that it's
tremendous bandwidth doesn't necessarily
forward 4k gaming playability on that
card with any really game-changing level
of framerate disparity so the fury X for
example is a pretty it's got pretty good
your architecture it's very well
designed it's got HBM doesn't
necessarily make it a great performer
that's something we talked about in the
fury X review but in terms of
architecture massive shader a all that
stuff and it still feels like it's kind
of stuck in some games when it comes to
4k gaming and that's in spite of having
a huge memory bandwidth and very fast
memory and new types of memory so to
answer the question it is the cores the
frequency of those cores how efficient
they handle certain operations so
ultimately yes it is the GPU itself
holding holding 4k back more than the
memory bandwidth necessary so hopefully
that addresses that this you can kind of
see in part by throwing more GPUs into a
system where you don't get more memory
you don't get more memory bandwidth and
you you see a bit increase in 4k
or 1440p performance and that is largely
because of the way the cores are handled
and because the extra processing power
you get in such a configuration so we
are still held back on 4k gaming for now
it's becoming more possible you look up
a 980ti you look at the fury X they can
both play games at 4k it just kind of
depends on what game you want to play
and how high the settings go The Witcher
3 for instance is very demanding and not
too kind to really any single GPU
solution at 4k so that should address
that decently alex maya coming back here
for another question i think i addressed
one of yours previously and alex says hi
steve does ram you get matter at all for
gaming for example 1600 megahertz versus
24 hundred megahertz eight gigabytes for
sixteen gigabytes casa latency is nine
versus ten or should I just choose the
one that has the prettiest colors oh
this I reported on this a couple times
now the the back part of the question
the prettiest color part I talked about
this a few years ago after I talked to
David Leon from Kingston at one of the
PAX events and we talked about how RAM
is a commodity now so yeah the color
actually does kind of matter because
it's become so sort of stale the
development of the memory industry that
color and appearance are starting to
become relevant because the specs are
really all very similar or the same or
close enough that it doesn't matter on
paper so yeah that is actually kind of
important and it seems silly to say that
but aesthetically you should buy a kit
of memory that you like now you should
also buy one that's backed by a
manufacturer you can trust and has
decent reviews and a lower return rate
but generally the the better looking
kits do coincide with the reasonably
performing kits so in terms of the
frequency a couple parts of this
question the frequency if you're using
an APU or an eye GP like the Intel ones
then yes frequency matters density
matters capacity not quite as much but
it does matter and that's because the
eye GPS and the APS do not have their
own on card memory so we
you buy a discrete GPU or a dedicated
GPU a d GPU we'll call it that has dies
of memory on the card itself and these
use gddr5 which is very fast
transactional memory it's a lot faster
than system memory ddr3 or even ddr4 and
it's also physically closer to the GPU
so the GPU doesn't have to communicate
through the bus through the chipset or
the CPU through and then to the memory
and then back again it's it's talking
almost directly to the memory on the
card and the CPU does get involved as it
always does draw calls it gets directly
involved there but its proximity wise
very close to the card so it's a lot
faster it's also just faster memory so
in that case when you use a dedicated
card you're gonna have way faster and
way better memory performance than when
you're using an AP or an IDP which has
to access the system memory and to that
extent frequency does matter quite a lot
actually and we've seen performance
differences of 10 percent ish in sort of
the middle to high end with APs and IDPs
using 1600 megahertz versus 1866 or 2020
133 so it does matter there for someone
using a d GPU the answer is no not
really we kind of see a little
difference at the low end like 1333
which isn't really made anymore
we're just 1600 once you get past that
the differences get a lot smaller and
they're smaller to the point that the
money spent getting the next bump up in
memory kit would probably better be
spent on something like a better video
card because the difference between a
memory increase in speed and a GPU
increase or an SSD added to the system
is it's a big gap they're talking about
density or capacity you're asked about
eight gigabytes for sixteen gigabytes so
there's something to memory we call
density that is how big the die the
memory thighs are on the actual PCB so
those come in different capacities
you see eight gigabyte sticks you see
four gigabyte sticks to go
right sticks that's what we call density
a higher density stick if you buy 2 8
gigabyte ones versus 4 4 gigabyte ones
you have 16 in either scenario and
theory a higher density stick should be
slightly higher performing for gamers
really you're not gonna see that
difference ever I mean it like never I
would not worry about it there if you're
in a really serious production
environment and you're building maybe a
lot of workstations for a render farm or
something then it's time to worry about
density especially if you're trying to
cram more memory capacity into one
system because then you need to higher
density chips to actually be able to
achieve 64 gigabytes or more or whatever
you're trying to do the castle agencies
do matter you do start sacrificing in
frequency or latency depending on which
direction you're going so that is an
argument that can be made for for
production workloads but for gaming
again just get something sort of 1600
megahertz ish 1866 if you're feeling
like spending a bit more if you have a D
GPU and for the most part any cache
latency with with those types of chips
is gonna do just fine on a gaming setup
so I would not worry too much about it
there I wouldn't just buy the prettiest
one though definitely target like a 1600
maybe 2x4 kit for the best outcome 1 by
8 you can get tired density but you lose
dual-channel
but that actually has almost no impact
on gaming and we tested this it has very
little impact on anything really except
again production check the channel
search it for dual channel dual dash
channel and you'll see what I'm talking
about there but no it doesn't matter too
much these days the last question here
is hi Steve I have a question that's a
good start what is the difference
between processor PCIe lanes and PCIe
lanes in the chip set does adding a
Wi-Fi PCIe card by 4 reduce my graphics
card link with CPU down from 16 to by 8
so this is a pretty good question
talk about skylake first and then look
at the Haswell unit that the asker has
with skylake the z170 chipset has twenty
PCIe lanes on it it's got 26 HS i/o
lanes high-speed i/o lanes and 20 PCI u8
included within that the 20 PCIe lanes
are in clusters of 4 so there's 5 sets
of 4 5 by 4 is 20 and to that extent you
can't actually use them for an SLI set
up because Nvidia requires by 8 so you
can't use those extra chipset lanes for
SLI but you can use it for things like
m2 cards if you have an SSD and you want
to get an m2 s m2 SSD you use those
lanes there because those are by 4 at
best right now if you get an nvme PCI
Express card even though it's sitting in
a PCIe slot on the motherboard it will
communicate through the chipset and use
the chipsets 4 lanes made available to
it in the case of Wi-Fi cards like this
question it will also communicate
through the chipset because the chipset
is handling all of that communication
all the i/o and the CPU in this instance
will allocate all of its lanes available
16 to the GPU now some CPUs have more
than 16 lanes they have 20 or 24 just
depends on which architecture you're
looking at so in this instance no adding
a Wi-Fi card with a by 4 requirement to
your setup will not eat into your CPU
Lane availability through the CPU itself
the PCIe lanes it will go straight
through the chipset and in this case the
questioner is using an H 81 chipset
which has a maximum of 6 PCIe lanes so
it will use some of those six basically
and you'll still get by 16 on the GPU
that said if any of you find yourself in
a case where you're in a situation that
you
lose some of the PCIe lanes to your
graphics setup so you're going down to
buy eight from by sixteen that's really
not a big issue because the buy eight
versus by sixteen performance the Delta
is is pretty small it's basically a
measurable for most games and graphics
cards depends on the video card because
faster ones will care more but even at
the very high end it's a pretty small
difference because PCIe three has a
pretty high throughput and it's large
enough that the interface is not the
bottleneck here it's the video card
itself is slower than the interface so
you can really not spend a lot of effort
being concerned about by British by
sixteen obviously everyone wants by
sixteen or if you're doing a single GPU
setup just it's a little bit better it
feels better too because otherwise it
doesn't feel quite right when you're
buying it but that should answer that so
that's all for this week if you have
questions for the next video post them
in the comments below I check this video
first for the next one person there if
you like this type of content as always
hit that patreon link the poster all we
picked up a lot of supporters in the
last week or so and for that I'm greatly
appreciative to all of you and I
certainly hope that you'll provide
feedback if you have different types of
content you'd like us to explore if you
have people you want us to interview
please post them below tweet us at
gamers Nexus I will see that first and
we'll try and set those up and see what
we can do to produce some good content
that is based in observable facts and
researchable things so that's all for
this time I will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
