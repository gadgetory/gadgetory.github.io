things with your organization training
that sort of stuff and also a bit with
Dean balancing how do you have you met
matically ahead lytic leaf ounce the
game mechanics sup me I'm bill burr news
I'm with CCP my wolf currently working
with the world of darkness mmm CCP you
know like Wolfgang's for 20 years also
on baking subsection 1 game with
holistic design I'm how man go open with
green running publishing and what do you
call the topic of my press as well and I
don't re-use on renege layout and gently
everything Conservation's for about 15
years so let's start with uh I guess a
little more philosophies on just the art
of game mechanics Oh Mike greenlar
philosophy is looking at things as I
mentioned a couple of you we're probably
my talk before the exploration versus
exploitation trade on and along with
that is also the you know the whole
narrative the whole experience so how
much do you want the player to explore
both a little sense but also in a in a
gameplay sense how much you wanted to
explore the mechanics of the game force
being told what to do but use use fire
against this use something against
something else and look at that for more
analytical perspective so my perspective
is looking at things saying well you can
treat everything's numbers you can treat
it all as the richness as how do you
balance the game how you communicate
that information how do you communicate
it effectively and how do you measure it
back and I think that they can you can
tie a lot with the story and setting
with that and that let's take over to
build two because I know you've done a
lot with with rebels in particular I'd
say my philosophy on the game design
first of all I think most gamers love
systems on a certain level that
crunchy sort of things I especially love
doing that in high school it was it I
got older though like I got much more
interested in just the storytelling
aspect so that the themes and the mood
and stuff and I'm less interested in the
actual mechanics I still am obviously
has a gamer there's no way around that
but sometimes right run game to beat all
the system plus almost rules elasticity
of here and I cyril magnin and but as a
publisher I think it's really necessary
to have a strong rule set or consistency
because here have been gamers do is do
not sit at the table argument more than
that completely a general agreement
there through the rules I guess where my
perspective my philosophy would be that
the game mechanics the mechanics of the
game should support the type of play
that you are attending and play
experience that you're attending that
players have and that comes very much
down to the type of style we speaking
for our own games for instance we've got
very different sets we made Dragon a
case of the computer game very ancient
tabletop version and that is a very very
different rule set than the game we make
for the game thrones or plugin which
because you know they're not they're
completely different sort of animals in
terms of the play experience your your
players are expecting when they approach
that game so it's like that's not the
key thing to me is that your rules that
need to be tight and strong and balanced
but only balance it so much as it
supports the gameplay that you want the
players that have I guess calculating
balance can be booked so I noticed an
interesting thing between both of you
bill you saying that you like sir to
almost a rulest environment and then how
are you saying that you sort of like
this this rule set well it all depends I
mean once again it depends on what
you're trying to do I mean there's a big
in the tabletop and roleplay game
industry right now there's a big
movement of so many games as well as the
bigger games and a lot of those are much
much more about sort of an interactive
storytelling environment or i think the
term i come up looking for is there 3h
its socket wrench games if you have to
take off the 38 inch nut there is
nothing better
in this particular thing but it's not so
good at doing other things and that that
all comes down to you know are you
making a broader rule 7 you making a
narrow rule set their RM there are very
specific targeted for one type of
environment rule sets and then there are
tool cables at something like dirts or
or even the hero system which is much
more intended to model be able to model
everything and those have very different
requirements in terms of when you're
designing I think because with the
toolkit rule safe to cover everything
the other types you can kind of go it's
with one you go well we're not going
down this point so we open the bottle
anything beyond that so so I cut this
sort of both of what Bill is getting but
again and what I was saying I think in
that thing that will set design thing so
I absolutely there's something to be
said about simplicity of games too so if
you're planning tabletop game if you're
your Dungeon Master sitting there
looking at the rules half of the time
they're just massively take real book
that's not very fun because you're not
getting much narrative you're not doing
what you're not experiencing much making
any decisions but versus a computer game
I know you guys talked about this a
little before you can have more more
rich models on a code you can have very
complicated things but at the same time
if the player doesn't quite follow them
then in a great name a little bit you
know we're all used to we're all pretty
using Newtonian physics because we live
in it and so if barrel NP girl goes up
in the water okay we expect that but
sometimes especially there's a
interesting game called velocity wrapped
or general a few you've heard of it it's
a flash game that came out recently
where you're playing is this this rapid
skates on ice but you're you're dealing
with relativity where the speed of light
is set at 33 meters per second or
something like that so all the spatial
distortions and time distortions and
information distortions so you're
watching these bullets fly by and as you
move in one direction Bulls get tighter
together further apart and how do you
maneuver around that and so sometimes
it's difficult to convey those complex
rule sets that break our expectations so
long if you guys can also comment on
other examples you can think of where
there's prudence even oceans of a
particular archetype of character or a
mechanic that you wanted to break
sort of innovation and give the player
some richer experience that you had
difficulty doing sir that's a tricky
question there I mean certainly as far
as breaking expectations I mean you can
do that very specific fashions like the
first game that ever came out from green
running puncturing was called pork and
if you played an org and orcs were you
know it did it didn't so much break the
expectations as it played into them to
the point where you got Ludacris you
know where it works are incredibly
stupid ignorant creatures and then we
actually but it was funny because the
press can contain a really cool mechanic
in as much as everything that an orc did
was opposed or but the difficulty of it
was determined by how their God crumb
felt about what they were doing so
crowded like what you were doing he got
more dice and he rolled against your
gods feeling on your on your action to
see who come hated what you were doing
or come language you were doing so it's
much easier to do things to be liked so
you know works were very stupid so it's
a funny game but it's an interesting
thing where the mechanic broke the
expectations of what you're generally
you know usually in a role playing games
you're like what is my target number or
how difficult is this and the difficult
that this was very fluid it was very
much like how does it even field on what
you're trying to do yeah that God hates
that that's really hard so that's the
best example 12 slips off my head
because I mean a lot of a lot of game
design is is fulfilling expectations or
we don't it's hard it's hard to shatter
people's to expectations without leaving
them completely at sea about what they
do in a game that's a no we play the
standard ropes all the time games and we
always good at something like the
Western apology models and stuff like
that is we don't have to explain a lot
you know everybody knows the tropes
everybody knows the games every knows
that or Muslim out of the ground have
axes and stuff like that and so breaking
the tropes is it is it it's a vicious
move when you do it and I think it's
more than any games these days and
once a lot of times right but I think
they can do because they focus on one of
many games is that very specific one day
where I read in this room and this is
how we're doing it whereas if you're
trying to do big setting especially a
kitchen sink study or whatever you know
you bring to me from Adam because just
about here yeah we talked about this in
the name of a mole above in front of the
panels when I talk about your world but
it's so weird it's very hard yeah
there's a game called children which was
similarly just rich and great you dive
into it was great explaining it to
anybody to tell you that is even
possible it's just makes no sense
whatsoever this is a place where I think
computing centers going to get advantage
over over over tabletop games because
you can break a trope and
instantaneously the players see what the
result of breaking that is it's like Oh
physics works differently here so when I
what I leap off this cliff I kind of
float through the air rather than so
it's exactly exactly exactly I want to
have plenty more from the science
fiction perspective one thing that it is
as a scientist roles me a little bit is
when I see bad science and film or games
or things like that we had we're
developing a car there was a long
discussion we had about whether or not
lasers should be visible when the ground
want to keep very hard science fiction
and it meant large number of ways but it
contains so much information to the
player about what you're shooting where
you're shooting it and we kind of long
debate about them actually we've cited
ok we'll make most lasers visible except
for this one type which we'll call it a
certain type and just have a puff of
smoke with it yeah and so that was that
was one way that we manage that but
again some people felt like oh this kind
of breaks the trope this breaks what
we're used to a little bit let me but
the same time you must back-ended
yourself into something where it's like
you know if I've had all days again I
couldn't see where it was firing let me
who views that laser cutting you know so
i think the movies
they actually having it I can see we're
doing the limited fashion makes
eliminates is just interested in you
don't have people going like whoa what
do I how it thinks I'm running well
thank you me hard science is not very
romantic and that's right I've space
hopper has a laser you can see as well
as a visual cues for you yeah it has
lightsabers but as an example of where
hard sci-fi can be almost a little too
dry sometimes I know if anybody ever
played 2300 it was a GW game back in the
90s and it was a it was a near the near
future point 300 was the year it was
super super hard as far as it could be
but when you come up against weapons
whether their damages listed is as
tamped explosive you know where you have
to look down at the explosives rules and
it actually gets the more realistic
something is looking at and harder it is
i mean if you look too far you end up
with something like phoenix command
which was a super realistic you know
fire combat science fiction game that
nobody wanted to play because you was
you know if you got shot by a gun well
look you just died from hydrostatic
shock that's too bad what a character
creation for travelers drive me great
because you can roll them to survive
character and in the argument for that
always as well too realistic because it
won't late I'm seeing on a table rolling
dice that's not realistic it was almost
at a certain point here it was almost a
pre game right yeah exactly i was just
teaching you how tough life is
I Imperator's down I finally got the six
book for you anyway as a more of it as a
pc game and interactive game designer i
went as you guys from can't I
perspective how is it dealing with dykes
knowing that you have a uniform this
probability distribution over so many
things if you want something other than
uniform proud of distribution they have
a lookup table or you have to have more
complicated making the game take longer
how do you trade off like probably
distribution that you would desire for
for the feel of game versus what is
easily achievable good question well you
know a world of darkness there's the old
story teller systems numerous system and
the old one the probabilities were all
over the place and it's really hard to
calculate them in your head so you're
just going by gun stuff what just feels
right in other words if I'm going to
raise the difficulty or the target you
have to roll or do I instead you know
subtract the number of dice you're going
to roll up stuff and the newer one all
that stuff is fixed and standardize
difficulties are number stays the same
and it's just that reflects that going
to help
and partly that was because it just so
crazy especially the more naughty world
and then like the bot rules for the
original system work the more days you
had actually easier was the box that
that was reminds him was the same
initially 0 plus of these ancient
powerful vampires could be watching you
know failing horribly more frequently
than the muni oh yeah it was crazy so
yeah let's look at Rapunzel on the way
but yeah it's fun because it's a lot of
days but it's also got level to this
feel right yeah there was a lot of I
think nice analysis kind of as a newer
thing because certainly when games like
my favorite buddy ever played first
edition shadowrun but the calculating
difficulty thing curve in that game was
unlike mary has you had you had target
numbers you had numbers of successes and
you had these two axes of success and it
was just yeah and also the fur told I
was the right manager for deadlines back
in the late 90s and the system is really
really good with the one part that was
always frustrating was figuring the
statistics and that were all based on
on-die types like savage worlds now is
the same way worse t68 but back then it
was but 46 like it's 46 better than 38
or you know which what's better what's
worse and it was really really hard to
calculate and I think now it's much
easier because you get the internet you
can be like what's the dice probability
of this and you can probably some of
that up on the web pretty quickly so
doing doing this organelle sits a little
bit easier thumb and one thing that
though though is you can constrain stuff
too much like that what you can what it
can lead to is it can lead to I mean
they can lead to power meaning it in
that same work once you've codified
everything to such a certain level then
the players can sort of you know use
that against Akane master it's a little
more if once again they're using AC
computer game is good because once the
player feel so smart and they feel a bit
beaten it using it against the GM can
actually be corrosive to everybody's
experience I think and that's a little
trickier thing the computer games don't
have to deal with so often they said
anything Wow
and what is those of arguments of
simulation is for some parenting systems
such and I think simulations is just the
pen and paper tabletop environment I
think it's just you're chasing after
their own boobs there whereas in a
computer game yet that you can get a lot
closer to that sort of thing because
your odds and stuff can be really
fantastically calculated by the computer
uncle quick but just doing it with dice
and charts and forever sometimes trying
to get a desk writing plus especially
like in adventure game you've built one
of the lots of real there's a new
edition of shaming sons which I didn't
actually work on but it was a licensed
property there was all sorts of argument
about putting in radiation rules because
it's realistic you're in space exposed
to radiation even can't you're gonna die
but you really want that what your
character happen if even a gamble world
when you got exposed to radiation
mutations cancer so the kids are so much
the opposite of funds to brain yeah
lizardy liam neeson recent YouTube video
check that out good so one thing with
that is a chocolate the narrative is
linearity versus ladder well laterality
if you want to call it that so talking
about that we had radiation we had these
different things to or you know somebody
says well I can maybe I can jump out of
a window this car what happened in a
game of unexplained reason there said
well you know there's a motorcycle
driving here by the third pump game as I
well could I pass the gym can I jump out
of the window of the car and jump these
guys like okay sure and if using a lot
of left points so like that did
something that was it didn't break the
game to do something very far from I
feel that and added a lot to the
narrative that we wouldn't have
otherwise considered but at the same
time you also want to have some windows
any game you have some sort of fixed or
or some money or two because otherwise
you need to basically write a chooser
adventure book a lot of content
especially for pc gaming or or for
consoles you have to develop all that
out that abscess yep the old voice
acting old story line all I kind of
stuff plan on that out and what's he
doing some sort of newer things with
narrative generation but even add is
still you don't get quite as good
stories yet so don't you guys any other
comments about I just think would you
brought up as a concrete trade-off that
you made between computer games and and
tabletop games is a computer game can
give you all the calculations done very
very quickly for very specific scenarios
but you know if I'm playing you know
let's just say it's a good example of
what the goods that will be what world
of warcraft of use this into another
panel the other day we're in the
original world of warcraft when you
couldn't fly you know you didn't have to
do some kind of scenes he's going to me
could go there and if somebody else that
had had the ability to fly the game
couldn't have adapted to that but you
know in a role-playing game around a
table somebody else i can fly the jam
had just has to go on all right well
let's see what happens here and you know
you can you can account for for enter
phenomena and players making you know
there's never with the right kind of GM
of the right kind of flavors there's
never play with the ga where the player
has to go can I do this and the GM can
has to say no if it's a good idea you
know if it's something that we're is in
a computer game the computer game is
constantly going now you know and
thatthat's it's constantly telling you
you can't do things and that's a fact of
any game when you start to play is you
figure out first of all like okay one of
the rules what can't I go through what
doors don't open you know what
directions can I go and in an RPG you
can instantly change that more fed you
know if I've run games where our players
had a good idea and I've just gone after
let's roll with that see where it goes
and I can come out to some really great
stuff and you know that sometimes that's
the trade-off one of the trade-offs
between tabletop and computer what their
strengths due to their strengths are
these computers are complexity and
sophisticated systems reduced to things
you don't even have to think about and
RPGs are complete flexibility in the
ability to change the story on a dime
just because everybody thinks they
should go that way
bring some of interesting of distinction
there where if you look at the so he
takes them take a simple game this
computer tells you no you can't do this
and says no all the time as you grow
let's see have a very rich sandbox game
where you can have tons of tons of
things operating all the same time down
the computer can model and say yes more
often than cam can because more than the
person can come out at the same time so
interestingly I think people sort of
bridge that gap yes for the middle size
maybe not the two yeah because I think
that was the problem is sick of us
sandbox game campy what do i do you know
right you know I just run around and
climb buildings and you know a bunch of
people or you know what where's the
story and that I know there's just the
flexibility of the city heart attack
lumpy friends and being able to go okay
guys you're doing this wrong let's just
do this sense that you know you can
explain stuff you could stop things
whereas computer game requires so much
more sophisticated you know also there's
a case if you want to make you don't
want to make constantly saying no suck
ya know you want to make it an
exploratory experience where I'm
figuring out the world I'm being told no
but I mean told know which means i can
figure out what the game will say yes to
yes but you're still going against the
game
storytelling because the human mind
imagination is so much more devil top
still I think that the paradigm in some
of the mix is the two of those is
something like neverwinter nights where
you can actually design on that scenario
run by a game master and that's still
something I don't think it was out there
people did it all these it's fully
developed I think we'll see some really
interesting stuff about that in the
future toolkits for people to create
adventures online that also brings up an
interesting point about content
generation so if you look at different
types of median or dip excommunicating
if you reading something you can absorb
something certain information right here
listening its lesser right if you're
looking at something like watching a
video something it's a different rate
but for different types of things and
for a good fear of managing if you have
the GM talking about things and saying
well here's how to describe it you're
started filling in all the details in
your online it's sort of distributed
distributed problem so I just want to
try point of you talk about a little bit
about exploration in games is it from a
narrative perspective so on the one
extreme you have games which are being
released now which are a little more
than okay press the x button now and
then watch a cutscene all the way
through two different sandbox means
certain they're sort of a and I think
tabletops are an interesting middle
point for them so I wonder if you guys
want to talk about the the narrative
rates and the exploration rate of
traversal in the game
really depends on the game time if you
run into genres and son I'm in a game of
vampire almost no one origin except in a
sense that here he doing macchiavelli
apologies for the deaths of the Jared so
or just you know how much can you screw
that guy by entering his allies against
him especially at a lark or college or
personal you know making deals and stuff
that guys it's gonna backstab you know
and so it's not so much an exploration
except for exploration yeah an
interesting part of games versus a Jew
games is also choosing when to gloss
over things like I played the Elder
Scrolls games not big curtain on out he
was a Libyan or the one before that bar
line but it was the one where you still
had to walk everywhere like every Marlin
yeah and and it it was it was an example
of like of gameplay actually getting the
way the experience of the game i think
in a way that would never have it on the
table top thing was just like you know
I've walked to this place and I fought
the monster now i'm going to walk back
and it's able to go okay you walk back
in the computer game of like I'm walking
for five minutes and if I really get
tired a monster attacks me and I die you
know that's it fix that in later games
but I mean that's a case where we're
computer game didn't correctly calculate
the I think the narrative rate the
things need to be presented didn't you
didn't calculate when to cut the corners
and actually just you know cut scene of
you know you know because you don't even
want that there's something to be said
about that what I explore I so you're
walking into this just be a really tough
boss walking this very rich pleasure
they spent tons of money in the art it's
really the experience is like walking
through it but again he'll I watched
Erick more than once maybe twice tops
eventually want some sort of mode of
transportation or method to get through
there more quickly yeah yeah I mean I
that may be a personal purchase req
repetition games is the thing that I
have the biggest
it can you do the same thing over and
over again if I've done it once please
don't make me do it again that's not a
Mustang box be different oh absolutely
and also can if there's a ga under 30
displayer certainly walking through the
same place in wow which I've done over
and over in is never the same thing
twice no there's also different details
about what you're glossing over remember
way back when I'm a long time about
fitting ife holder for those pc long
time ago and that can really suck up to
me because you've had to manage food you
had to manage water of your party and at
first I'm like wow this is really cool
they really got all the stuff in like I
hate doing this and I don't I can't
think of any games i've seen or many
things I've seen do things like that
recently and you know just like you
never see people into bathrooms in the
movies because it's kind of boring right
yeah yeah let me talk to up not the
panel on tabletop to computer game stuff
that we could talk about the other day
baldur's gate which was very very you
know a direct translation of the
tabletop experience into the computer
game that did you have to manage food
water than I can remember what are you
were one character in all this game we
really know that was one another spice
gay sex there's no law who are watering
okay drive to rest for spells though
malice bitter Cinco de bunda clear if
you rested towards metals you can trust
another couple of interesting and so a
lot of translation of that sort of stuff
to know the tabletop experience did and
then along this mechanics has been
learning what made payments to dispose
of I don't say a lot of this mechanics
have just got disposed of in table top
two i think that you know there's much
less emphasis in a lot of games now on
you can plan for enough water it looks
like your day I said put the exception
of maybe dark sun recently they actually
have those but I think a lot of them
way has the dump unique aspect of the
game system it doesn't take as much
focus because the idea they're here on
an expedition you getting a blatant Bob
these resources yeah I doing this right
members were expelled hearing the right
amount of water yeah well you know the
war becomes just a social game or we're
going to go into town down these guild
cares what you're carrying at that point
yeah and I think I think that may be
enough games to admit to this engine up
when you should implement that sort of
those girls have a place because when
you're worried about it when you're
going on a dungeon crawl or something
that's in there that's a part of your
narrative right there if you're like
you're like the monsters destroyed half
your water that's a problem no water yes
the flip side though if you let it if
you let things to lose so you have sort
of a path dependence if you go to the
dungeon you have planned for all these
different things and you lost in the
water but you didn't have enough
resources and now you're I don't know an
hour into it you realize I gotta do this
whole thing over again even though I've
saved several times those weren't good
enough they need to go back and replant
everything differently it frustrates you
is a player however on the flip side if
you can reduce stuff so easily like take
the AZ score for example in there you
can create basically any kinetic
creature you wanted they were all kind
of equal you couldn't make it creature
that you know you have all of your
creature and it couldn't be something
that is so bad you had to start over
again and that sort of heard the feel
the game too because now there's you can
get to the goal anyway it's so simple in
a way that almost becomes not a game
really that becomes open or may become
an experience except you know and I
think that's the danger of the removing
the narrative even if that narrative is
you know you're the story of your
creature of all being successful because
if you remove the failure rate then
you've got the story of your creature
revolving and that's not really a story
that's just you're watching a process I
thought evolution
failures yeah another thing that the to
bugaloos were always liked my food water
incumbrance writing conference is
actually all the computer games too
because if you think about like old
first-person shooters we were carrying
like an entire personal on your and not
every time in some future still like
that like I don't think Serious Sam you
need to worry about that sort of thing
but like a tower like you have an accent
where weapon slots what you carry and
what your juice is actually important to
how you deal with the story as you go
forward yeah so another that's a good
thing that's like whoops picked our
weapons or that's problem anything been
immersed in the world of darkness for so
long it's always so alien cocaine that
does calculate encumbrance and money and
pieces of gold you have any compromise
vampire you have resources dots one
through five that tells you rich you are
but that didn't get something or not I
think that speaks to help the type of
players the place our games though to
like a slow no storyteller player if the
jam goes you can't carry all that is
going to go right here it says you know
where as with other games you know there
might be arguments like that and this is
the part where Tiger ruleset getting
back from tighter rules everything like
that can feed into that or that the
player can go clearly right here it says
that i can carry all that GM has no
recourse but to go you know god
oldenburg yeah very much poor church s
and resident evil that also does that
end reply organization different player
catcher some players that are there
curators of what they do and they like
micromanaging all that stuff they'll
have all their materials and everything
packaged in there and bin packing just
so so they fix everything fit everything
they possibly can there's something like
that along we do in your painful it is
it is and i mean i guess a ruleset a GM
GM who has a fighter who likes that can
be like all right let's let's do
something on the fly to reward you for
that or something I might be a way to
view it it's like it something wants to
do that and the rule set is actually
supported you can possibly reward
for taking steps that would concretely
be good ideas if they were supported by
the rule set I'm never going to do that
just because I've never played people
that actually like to do in conference
that also an interesting game called
gratuitous space battles if there's any
game that came out a few years ago where
the game was all about configuration
management so you as a space space rap
game you built when configure all your
spaceships and they let him go in the AI
fought and then he watched I and I I
personally was a huge fan of the game
although I thought some of the aspects
really cool to focus all on that and
target was the discovery forgot what
combinations of things work which ones
don't and you know but also trying to
tell you how they how they work it
reminded me there's a you know my flight
recently done tabletop where we got
bogged down for probably an hour working
in the configuration by the end people
or Kent board but nobody wanted to agree
well how exactly can figure this ship
that's an interesting it sounds like an
interesting game because that's a case
where you're reviewing the system to the
player through trial and error okay put
something together you go out there and
if they're watching the fight they learn
something about the system underlying
things and how to breed convenor
configure their next one that's nothing
that's that's a can you do that tabletop
kind of people that would be really
really interesting to play a game where
the mechanics the players literally
don't know them until they play I know
it's a great that's actually kind of an
interesting you know trying to Alicia
ninjas yeah we just set up a premise and
you don't tell the players I mean
they're certainly games where you told
the players like the river of those that
follow the Phoenix there's this one
particular game that I'm not wearing
anything because it was a fantasy game
they loaded game you're never going to
find a copy of it but I think it was an
up you basically make up your players as
a bunch of astronauts that's the premise
of it put your players in the spaceship
and you tell the players is a space
exploration game and you set them up for
it and what it actually is is they go up
into space and there's like some sort of
beer dimensional shift and they come
back
and everything is different so you lie
to your players about what the game's
about yeah goodnight a movie yeah when
we come back and everything I think it's
become like there's a little game called
action castle which is there's two games
of this genre where it's a text
adventure via spoken text and there's
keep you guys I know who run this at
some different inventions like the game
thanks guys room and Scott where they go
up there you have the person who says
that they freeze off just like you would
a text adventure and then you know queue
of people every person gives a command
they did this last night of the d20
burlesque show okay yeah action on tavi
it was pretty funny it's orc striptease
yeah so amazing thing about that about
discovery is that they'll be playing if
you will say up or climb the ladder or
the different valve moves and if they
don't get it right the narrator says
sorry can't do that or some some no that
was the funniest thing was watching the
people who had never played a text
adventure and then say something that
made no sense in the person we gillard
sorry I can't do that yeah shooting
right they watchin like yeah its own
experience will say save restore yeah
save and one guy finally word check his
inventory and even had the persuasion
thing we're like one person with the
purse a close they shouldn't have gone
and they were killed me game ended to
the next person had to start over so one
thing like that about game rule
discovery which I feel like this changed
a little bit back in the 1980s you had
an instruction book The Oaks Henry for
the games and figure things out oh how
do i how to pass this chasm whatever you
had to figure that out versus now I feel
like everything's guided the first time
you're showing how to do something the
first time you do something you're shown
explicitly how to do it and maybe the
game will have you put two things
together which you didn't know before
but that's at most and I'm not sure
that's necessarily maybe that's what we
haven't seen such teams where you
discover more of the rules I know yeah
certainly like I just behind the times I
just start playing Assassin's Creed
recently and Emma but there's stuff in
that opening part that you never figure
the game didn't show you how to do it
like a disappearing socially that sort
of stuff you really need to be shown how
to do that but there's some things like
the climbing that you know I can figure
that out it'd be better if the game that
show me that just the stuff that I
hadn't there was no possibility we know
what kind of learn I guess interesting
yeah ideally wouldn't need a tutorial
but we're not human error all over the
world or kids cheat yeah and there's
also the expectations of your talked
about before if players play the genre
before they expect out this is how
things should generally work but
sometimes it's very difficult to so in
for us i'm making an RTS we had a few
constraints of a cron than other games
don't have so we had a ton of emulation
aspect but that puts such a strong
burden on our computational resources
that we had to make some shortcuts that
haven't been seen in years four games in
terms of path fighting in terms of like
how basement food versus physics face
collisions and stuff like that and so in
some ways younger players who've not
play earlier games in the genre we're
more loss than older players so there
are some general generational aspects to
them and there's also some examples if
you've seen them somebody a long time
ago made a video of what super mario
brothers the first game would be like if
you played it today it's like here's ago
but press a now to jump yeah yeah yeah
that's actually I came to play better
yeah we come so used to him holding the
way you're introduced to games that you
know and i think you know that's an
interesting thing because there's an
opposite movement i think in tabletop
games where right now there's a lot of
this is on because this it's not so
quick seven and you can't show you like
teaching the player how to play as they
read the game is or you know telling
them probably how to play the system but
what kind of game they are playing is a
very important thing and i think a lot
of mean because these easy everybody
knows
it's kick down the door Gila monster
take the treasure but other games you
know the expectations are totally
different and you have to really tell
people how how the game has been
designed to be played I think it's what
it comes down to because you try to play
a game every game like DD it really
won't work out so well you know oh yeah
baby much have fun which is the most
important about every games if you have
fun that's so after that reminds me of
another thing with try to have enough of
a rule set that you can start off the
game playing with and have fun with it
so if you have a few actions you can do
a few items whatever you wanna make sure
that that's fun enough yet the play are
cooked otherwise they need to read the
entire row boat for tabletop game or
have tons of tons of items before it
gets interesting then they're not going
to play it so there's a lot of
platformer games where ok this is I've
played up the Jillian platformers and
they're all the same this one is really
cool stuff but we need to get you
through all these hoops before you can
do like braid might be a really
interesting example of that where it did
subverts a lot of your expectations of
what a platformer is and how it works
and I that game is almost ruthless and
not explaining it to you it's like it
here I really have to figure out what's
going on and watch things in trial and
error and stuff and I thought that was a
very interesting experience when I
played it to try and think that was a
case where I think they ought to get the
system sort of reveals you reveal it's
revealed to you by you just trying stuff
and doesn't work figuring out how to do
it is part the game and at the same time
I think it's important to design that if
you're going to make that type of game
that the price for failure is is not a
pain in mud it's like you're back in the
game brother Cleveland and upon which I
learned because no one start on the
entire thing that we're again if you
just because you didn't figure out the
games look pretty little way that you
know something work as the night those
arcade games in there
way back way at first the price of
failure Larry's you know the quarter
yeah yeah exactly so much money on those
in the sort of the roguelike games which
embrace death it's all procedural
content and every type of pleasure the
game is different the whole layout is
different than enemies that you kind of
were different and people sort of like
that it's not it's not my thing but
there's a culture around embracing death
and racing new experiences with them
yeah where would you play something that
I just played journey and I'm interested
this inquiry where we would feet fit in
here because the rules of that game are
very simple once you know once you've
figured them out and the system is never
revealed to you at all the systems of
totally opaque it's it's almost more an
experience but it still feels like a
game you know because there are enough
puzzles to solve and things to do and
and threats and things like that but
it's an interesting eli's on the cusp I
think between game and experience I mean
if you guys played it all yeah yeah I'm
going to describe it for presenters race
play journey and all okay so do you have
you got a good discards okay so it's the
journey of life you start off as this
it's been a number of years to fill in
things I played but you walk it you walk
the journey of life and it's like you
just move around but as you move towards
the right you get older and erotically
different get this is their game so this
this game literal you start out in the
desert you're in here this cloaked
figure and you start walking toward
there's this mountain with a light on it
you start walking toward it was this
that mean company zine damage anything
okay again and it's interesting because
you know you learn that you can do like
you can do you can sing a song that will
activate some things and as you get you
go along you know this this up it's a
sash behind you gets longer and longer
as you do certain things that you can
fly around a little bit and it's it's
very it's funny because there actually
aren't a lot of walls you can strain
showing you the way you just know
there's this big mountain and it seems
like a good idea to head for it and and
it sort of goes from there and you're
there are things you just open and that
you know things that you have to sort of
build and stuff and there's another
aspect as well then I think if you're
online at the same time I only
encountered one other player in my
journey I played it but other place
where online you can encounter them in
the same place at the same time they
look exactly like you and stuff but it
just it was a very interesting
experience to experience to sort of
coming something that was so close to
game and so close to not gain at the
same time I think so to describe that I
believe the game is called the journey
of life which the one that I thought no
games grabbing is very similar in a way
where you start off as this character
that you just sent us this flat map and
you start walking and you realize as you
walk to the right you age your kit and
eventually you can find things like you
can get things that earn you the stuff
like like I forget what how it works
with different points you can find a
wife and then as you keep on moving to
the right or you might different
progress through a passage for the
passage that's what it's called and you
pat you passed your life again it's one
of those questions is this a game isn't
that or isn't an experienced and wise
right between two of them yeah yeah and
I guess those are much less much less
system dependent in terms of the game
system underneath them it would be
interesting this is the case where to be
interesting to actually talk to the
designers would be like so what is the
system by this is this just a movie am I
just you know am I just reacted going
through these motions or is there an
actual system for what I'm doing you
know only repeated is this the the eyes
of nuts I've yeah I haven't done it
again done it again so I don't know I
know you're gonna be different because
you encounter different people and like
things certain things can get done in
open done faster quicker fashion like I
went through this one section where
they've been nobody there about half an
hour but this dude you know sort of it
before went around did everything I just
kind of followed along and overcome play
well but it was an interesting
experience that's something that would
be actually very hard to replicate I
think the tabletop review guys with me
player to movie really okay so okay on
the flip side is also again at the house
it takes away the experience as much as
possible it's called we have to burn the
rope and this was a sort of a spoof game
in 2009 and a lot of critics Tommy where
you come into the game
you have to burn the rope and all the
instructions you walk you through this
really simple super simple platform
where you cannot guide and everything is
telling you how to beat the boss or you
go up if you burn the rope and then you
bring the rope and kill and that's a
little game it's just showing how
simplified and how how tutorial Ornan
oriented and how lack of a game some
games are today yeah she's leaving
should we take some questions you're
gonna take some okay great questions are
there come out so I like a Gaelic games
where you can choose between either
hoping another player are screwing them
over how important would like be a
balance and making sure that players can
get through a certain luffy's Abby Atlas
games are notorious for having end of
the poem but kind of like how do you
determine like where is that balance to
be like be able to progressive out
somebody there wow I would think that's
entirely on your your goals for the game
I mean it is a competitive game or is a
property game and if you don't like the
statement about you know both the Uni
both some balance is good in my
experience people tend to prefer a clean
cut collaboration or competition in
general in other games we have so unique
Ron you know with all the time equation
we have the ability to change alliances
during game play during any point in
time now if you're planning RTS you say
well I with someone else or something
and now I'm break that alliance that
creates into some strikes but when you
go back in time and say I never wanted
to have had this alliance to begin with
players basically were like wow this is
powerful amazing but nobody wanted to
touch it because they wanted to keep all
their friends
and as I talked about earlier in my
previous talk about game theory is
there's an interesting custom where you
have the National Libya where you're
doing the best that you can give
everybody else's strategy and the Pareto
optimality where everybody is nobody can
be made better off without making
someone worse on and when those are a
misalignment that's when you get Mexican
standoff that's what you people who were
backstabbing each other and that's fun
and interesting happens all the time in
the real world but it creates tension
and animosity among game player
sometimes so if you're very delicate
with how you apply those in game design
I think just as a sign of time travel is
probably a focus for a game that as
difficult on the tabletop as it is you
know if your way if you want to do a
realistic there was uploaded one time
travel RPG I can remember that was
continuing yeah yeah and that game the
fact that it had 3 supplements against
OSHA well isn't a testament to it being
a bad game it's a testament to how
freakin hard it is to recommend around
actual time travel if you try to get it
out what you can computer or not I mean
well it's one of those things where it
baffles any attempt to do a lot of any
detail work in your game because some of
this comes with doesn't really quickly
changing we gotta run out of the chronal
energy though and that worked pretty
well but even today there's some people
who they have their own mental model
time travel from various fiction that
they've encountered and most of time
ninety-nine percent of stuff out there
is not internally consistent right and
they they're used to that but though
you're in a consistent system they feel
like I can't break it I'm stuck I think
that's the best hazard taking time
travel from from pendency of science
fair society advanced charge of those
not be consistent you know bars a river
ya later buddy besides little hard
present
creating game design can be such a
various private different ideas stories
need different kind of game mechanics
where you guys like to start it's good
to me i always start with story I mean
that nuts I don't you know where you
like like here is the narrative about
but more like what what types of stories
do you want the game to facilitate to
tell I think that's the jam oh it's are
the court the question was when you're
designing a game and you're trying to
determine the basically where do you
start what do you what do you the first
thing you choose to as your starting
point to determine when you're designing
a game like that like I said reads it's
you have the overall stories that you
want to be able to tell in the game I
think yeah I remember that that's
certainly where I started with fading
suns which was a system came after the
idea of what what are we building here
what's the game what kind of stories
you're standing but what kind of layers
area what kind of people you're gonna
play and all that and of course fading
suns was very intentional
kitchen sink science fiction thing so it
had to be a system that was brought
enough to handle huge reindeer things as
the black sheep here who works more on
pc games and strategy type of it like
RTS type games we think more about what
what do we want the player to think
about first what type of decisions do we
want them to make a very technical
information we want them to assimilate
to make those decisions because that's
really what the from a strategy
perspective looking immersion is about
where is their head at we don't want
them to be bogged down in details that
don't matter to them we want to be
making interesting and engaging
experiences that fit with invested with
an area that is very important that
filled with their preconceived notions
of what they're playing and it's start
there and say okay what do we need to
focus on what are the important aspects
of game playing what parts do we did not
matter and they do some exploration
because sometimes you know the game
mechanic that oh this is we thought this
is a great idea play test that nobody
cares about to the southern part of the
games really cool we should flush that
out more and so there is a little bit of
exploration in that regard to I person
guys in valve talk about that where
there's a forgive whose philosophy there
was you take the you make you make a
bunch of game mechanics and you find the
two minutes of gameplay that is the best
and most fun and you make the game out
of that and then you do that initial
exploration then you exploit that two
minutes of gameplay and on the flip side
from the tabletop perspective sometimes
you just come across like a killer
mechanic and you go that's really neat
like what is this fake and I think a lot
of indie games have come up that way or
somebody's like this is a really cool
way to model x and you know if it models
X really well and X is fun just make X
and sometimes you don't have to worry
about a broader rule said there was one
of connotative it was is logging back in
the two thousand around 2900 it's been
experimental game play sessions talking
about how he felt that a lot of indie
game developers were now deconstructing
and reconstructing game mechanics in
ways that are brand-new a couple
examples one was a shadow physics which
I don't think was ever made yet I hope
they make this thing look it was so cool
where you played as a shadow in
three-dimensional world and there's a
ball there's two light sources you push
the ball with one Shadow Ball to roll
that way you jump around with the
platform and push it the other way so
you interact with
the tree world through the shadows and
taking and looking at things from new
perspective like light darkness or sound
there's another friend of mine who made
a game that called aura that had no
graphics you're just listened are uh
it's I think it's called aura the unseen
like a UH a you are a it made that like
45 years ago I didn't bidden some of
many copies but if you had to like
listen in different directions there was
a tile-based puzzle game think about
kind of dungeon crawling and alleged
result of the original that's kind of
what it was like but looking at what can
we remove from game and how can we take
these pieces put them together in new
ways another one mega here the
four-dimensional platformer where your
L&amp;amp;R buttons are sliding through the
fourth dimension and they choose two of
two circles and two rings that are
brings three dimensions and a lock them
via the fourth dimension between portal
is a probably the highest profile
example does anyone yeah um on the table
top siders game called drag which I mean
it's a uni game that's a four game and
the attention of the horror is is
facilitated by a Jenga tower you guys
ought to have known every time the dread
level rises you remove towers and you
know and its really interesting way of
using a physical object to actually
provoke the emotional response you're
trying to get from the players in the
game ion plated personally that if your
friends who played and they say it
actually really works and like bored and
you're like super tense well it's not
says that's an interesting way of taking
something i'm taking a completely other
thing from a completely other game and
just going we could roll in a row clunky
about this happen it works when we had a
sense mechanic too that's a cool thing
we had similar connoisseur if you feel
about a cron where they said it feels to
us like a survival horror game in a way
because there's always this unsettling
feeling that someone's going to go back
in time to change something you see in
pop back and pass and what are they
changing at you go figure that discovery
and there is that sense of surprise will
wear you know poor is all about being
surprised in again unpause ative way
over and how do you harness that any
different ways that are necessarily
scary don't frighten people draw in your
player base
a second game we were really into for a
lot of months ago year ago the shadow
City order to use your GPS on your
smartphone and use you set up your realm
of sorts around your house and example
towers and it will powers and stuff that
you're fighting in southern people
they've got their rooms and so you have
to get in your car go to actual relevant
not nothing like at night cause I top
paying attention that also becomes all
dumb shit all over town just talking
about town to other question this lets
so we get it back there back there so
you guys are talking about hearing
capacity or managing food games the
candidates an element of like previous
or realism in so really talk with the
name of the talking the argument has is
if you want to make sure that the player
feel something I feel like you know give
them again you and that say this game
focuses on
thing sometimes especially like reading
through werewolf the apocalypse one of
the things they didn't give the
werewolves an event for at all was house
spirits specifically interactive
wearable after an average and so it's
like kind of leave it up to the
storyteller but what is important like
like how do you make a decision to go
there's not a mechanic and so it doesn't
have a cannibal wait but you stop your
players you still want to be no and what
makes me what makes a differentiation
between heading into your players and
saying no we can't codify this what
caused it would not go justice or hear
what makes that decision what did you
own is to say no this is yes it is well
it really just spirits especially is one
you over mechana sighs those sort of
things and then they will feel
experience they feel like widgets that
you're just plugging something in town
and since there were something of the
other worlds you're supposed to be able
were mysterious and it's something I
wish I explored more when I was actually
working on wearable and because there's
so much of a richness there in those
interactions in those relationships and
there's a tendency because of the gifts
and such where you learn this from a
badger spirit to where it seems like
it's just a very simple 110 cal earnest
but but there should be a little water
you know interaction going on and what
does that add your spirit one and so
yeah I wish I had you know we done a lot
more it is
future really and I think a lot of
things you gave Oakland games as you can
without like reducing something two
numbers you can you can codify how it
works and you don't have to turn it into
a die roll and maybe that's sort of the
area where you wish you've got a lil for
you know what to turn into that wasn't
right le diable it was a concept of Chi
manoj you had to give them something
yeah it's very open yeah we should have
gone into a lot more guidelines yeah
yeah and I think that's one one thing
that another thing that Oakland games
can't do is after their out you can go
lovely invoke you know there's more
information on that right now and it's a
little easier you know with computer
games is and some are obtainable
certainly something like a or what we
have point releases and things but it's
super easy to go on your website yo hey
this is how that works you know or
something like that but I'm just just
got a feeling that right you know and
sometimes you just don't know like you
put something out it's something you
think is a throwaway deal turns out to
be something that players are like this
is super important and you gotta whoops
well I guess any more rules on and in a
runaway GN and say oh and different
editions of games are always away for
that like the shower runs an example the
first edition here the rules were a mess
the decking that you know one of the
core things of the game was this whole
sort of human-computer interface thing
liberals were just terrible I read the
game and I pretty much at all nice and
made stuff up as the GM because they
just didn't support the actual play that
they intended well that's interesting
thing to think about is it you know is
what you do when you encounter a rule
that is antithetical to the type of play
that somehow is made it into a published
product and the wolf was just to do porn
frankly yeah and keep you here
I said this before one of my from the
shadowrun this is great rich setting but
actually playing it part of this is
because we lose it almost and also means
three separate several adventures are
sort of yeah it does any better hackers
going into the cyberspace yeah and
nobody else is there with him even
though they're physically in st.
location the astral guy oh he's an ass
yeah and also we're fighting the guards
here and I wish they'd done a lot more
to try to integrate these experiences
and all along on the same I think
they've done that over and over through
the additions I think that's been one of
those recursive getting there and
therefore i played for the addition app
yeah it's a tough thing again that's an
example of where the the world you're
sold as you want to play in the system
doesn't support the group play that you
want to have you experienced you want to
have necessarily and put then i'm
getting other rules I think they're
probably more like you know that was
more you need to be told how to apply
the rules rather than necessary changes
right but it leaves a case another
singling out you know but it's just it's
just an example of the whole basic part
of the tabletop game is the experience
of a group it's not a solo game for the
most part yeah and a lot of games either
down
in consideration and one of the things I
really like about werewolf is you could
have a pack and that's already a
pre-existing idea it also packs and it's
already it's like well it's a very
morphology from the real world into this
world yeah and eight or attention of
those sort of things that you know are
together and they're not going to split
the party own reasons not for the old
cargo you mean in the tavern but if you
have too many house rules we have
different configuration spaces you end
up with players who are getting good at
and enjoy playing different completely
different versions of the game so for
example we've been fighting game and
there were certain item drops that some
players like I don't this I think this
item breaks the game about like playing
with us on you use these items instead
and if I use the other items you can hit
it with very very different games you
know everybody's just using bazookas in
a first-person shooter and that's it
it's a very different game than the
knife fight right but there are
different servers that was no surgical
things but they are really quite
different paint yeah different flavors
of the same game everybody has to be on
the same page in terms of what you're
playing is perfect that's definitely
just come true for you and available
liquor straight never be one of the
weirder any way way way back when que
hace of publishers and it rules for all
sorts of different games that's been one
of us traveler right so we're playing
our traveler game in our game after
crash learn about the world and one of
the characters in there I wasn't
familiar with
point is a guy who does every time you
hit everywhere generates just going to
keep coming back and my friend gets so
angry at this me what it's basically
worked his way back car crash you to get
his plasma gun in the hopes of that
would take the darn thing down and so
then you've got was never in one of the
plasma gun what is a fantasy world haha
by the way these worlds were series of
books from the 80s and 90s but whenever
you are aspirin and we're really over do
another one we get to say right what's
happened five minutes i read ticket soon
as you watched uncle questions let's go
good yeah so you mentioned early on
about breaking the game balance for the
sake of making to get better because you
get like an example of that and how you
would do that without unwanted side
effects to be honest no it was a foot
comment at the top of my head and i
think it could have a valuable game good
thing but i don't successfully apply it
but it was a concept i think it's a
valid one and i think that there's fun
to be had there with it but i never
successfully done it 2 comments that one
go back in time and wash my talk at
Tremont or 3 30 35 and another comment
about that is sometimes by breaking the
rules are changing them up a bit you get
people who are used to playing one way
to be in an equal footing so for example
I'm not a great chess player but
sometimes will say well let's look at
the rules been play chess variant and
then people who are better at chess
tonight we can play in more equal
footing I actually just not an example
another be ARS magica in which which is
a trigger is a fancy game which are
playing medievals the wizards and
sorcerers and it's a very very hermetic
you know like wizardry is something you
have to do it carefully and all this
kind of stuff and usually in a troop
there's one wizard the wizard is far
more powerful nobody else and the game
actually encourages true places that
people switch characters from time to
time so that nobody has to always be
that it was a bit it's a case where the
Wizard can you no is powerful enough to
burn all of his other companions be felt
like it and that's a case where the you
know the player balance is completely
off it does a lot of fun to be had
because the wizard while he's the most
powerful he doesn't like to go hit
things that's what he has anything
students that he sends
to do that but that's it that's about
the only example on behalf of the top of
my head where game you know imbalance
between power of players is an actual
feature of the game and feature the way
it's played rather than at a bug
something kind of related is natural
selection where it's an RTS and
first-person shooter at once so one
player is the general and then Evan else
is the infantry let's go to go forward
for you just over here okay I'm thinking
about them in terms of when making game
design and I you've got your mechanic
set up how do you go about like deciding
how complex you really want the
mechanics a product given to example to
a video game when do you decide to go
with an inventory system from final
fantasy where you have a little spots
for everything but everything gonna be
99 to the hablo where everything has a
shape and form as if it in your bag well
it's about the design of the game goals
i means someone is called Diablo RV for
boys accessorize your stuff that system
is there to facilitate that exact kind
of game and I the contrast between
sophistication and complexities you're
probably brought up here we're like you
know something could be sophisticated
with means there are a lot of
permutations to it a lot of depth to it
and it can look at complex but I think
actual complexity is when something is
actually difficult to no purpose I think
that'd be a good definition of
complexity within games yes no monetary
natori system but sometimes I mean
there's those studies now side
but you can really hit your hand just
yeah that's as you can guard again
detailing things where it's like you
through the reason most game cards /
games have set of cards as the hands
because that's like cerebral II what
most human beings can handle the choices
of complexity is making more choices
that's a ginger I'm probably seven five
o'clock speak too much so somebody sort
of permutation for complexity and
sophistication being the richness of
thinking that goes into something you
can manage your head let me tell you
apply to complexity I guess I took at
the same time good we probably one more
like sodium in yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
