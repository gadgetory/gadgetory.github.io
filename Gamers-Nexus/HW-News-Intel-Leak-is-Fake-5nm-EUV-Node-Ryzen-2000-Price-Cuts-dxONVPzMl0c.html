weeks ever but it's not over yet and one
of the news items for this week refers
to the Intel comet Lake slides that were
leaked out there ie fabricated because
they're fake so we really talk about
those rise in 2000 second gen prices
dropping significantly with the launch
of the new chips not surprising but also
a good opportunity to potentially buy
something instead of third gen if you
were considering third gen the
second-generation
CPUs have their newer prices are some of
AMD's biggest competition from AMD
samsung 5 nanometer UV based LP nodes
are progressing custom Navi cards for
mid-august and MSI updating the AM 400
series boards with 32 megabyte BIOS
chips before that this video is brought
to you by the be quiet dark rock slim
keeping a high performance focused but
reducing the footprints to accommodate
full memory slot compatibility the dark
rock slim comes with one of be quiet
silent wins three 120 millimeter fans
built for low noise operation the dark
rock slim advertises cooling capability
up to 180 watts EDP
but mixes in a matte black out color
design to combine performance and looks
learn more at the link in the
description below so first of that Intel
comet Lake slide it's fake we saw our
friends over at PC world had posted a
similar story talking about why they
thought it would probably be fake and
pointed out a few things like silly
typos apostrophes where they don't
belong although Intel did make one of
those mistakes itself and things like
putting the dollar sign after the
numbers stuff Intel wouldn't do but PC
world pointed those out what we did is
we just reached out to some people in
addition to their information and the
answer was that although not official
our understanding is from sources close
to the matter that these are not slides
that Intel made Intel did not make those
slides and we'll have it on the screen
at some point but basically the rumor
was something like 10 core chips at $500
at 5 or over gigahertz all core and this
is just kinda is
it's a dangerous expectation to set
because we end up in the same
where we were with Rison that's not to
say Intel can't do this at some point
just like it's not to say and he
couldn't do higher frequencies at some
point but with Rison 3000 series you saw
rumors months ago that we're saying it
was a 5 gigahertz and the implication
was all core which everyone reasonable
knew that was never going to happen but
unfortunately because a lot of people
are inexperienced with this stuff and
you know they don't have enough
background knowledge to know that 5
gigahertz all core on the Rison 3000
series wouldn't happen without Alan to
you the end result was that a lot of
people ended up feeling disappointed at
launch even though it was actually a
pretty damn good launch overall so
comment leek slides the best thing to do
right now is to ignore them and not
listen to rumors about comet Lake until
it's close enough to launch that we're
gonna get some actual leaks from
motherboard vendors or something like
that people who probably have the CPUs
rather than fake slides so yeah that
slide not real Intel Corporation it's
official comment is Intel does not
comment on rumors this is a it's a
pretty standard official comment the
information we collected from other
sources though including some of the
motherboard vendors to validate that
information is that the slide is fake so
that'll that'll wrap that story and PC
world has it kind of funny right up by
Brad about things like misgivings on
typos and dollar sign positioning of the
chart so you can check his article if
you want to see more of that if you
don't believe me
Intel's new interconnect and packaging
this is real news this comes from in
Towson newsroom website and as the
monolithic die approach to building
chips gets more complex and limited by
physics both and the end Intel have
taken a chiclet approach to CPU design
as you've seen with rise in 3000 series
at some icon West Intel took the lid off
new packaging and interconnect
technologies that the chip maker claims
will carry chip designs into the future
Intel's new packaging technology is
called Co omit and it essentially
combines embedded multi die interconnect
or emit and fog
as you recall Intel or if you recall any
way until debuted email back in 2017
when it announced a partnership with AMD
to bring Intel processors with Radeon
graphics to market that partnership
resulted in the KB Lake G chip with
Radeon graphics powering the haiti's
Canyon nook that we tested and
overclocked extensively and we can
probably find some old footage of that
and put it on the screen actually when
we did the haiti's Canyon overclocking
we use this custom case that was made by
former danger done guys and will drop a
shot up of that or something so that was
pretty fun but that's where you made
more or less started valve Rose is
relatively new it's something that we
talked about around December of last
year and it's a 3d chip stacking
approach to chip design it is supposed
to result in what Intel is calling
hybrid x86 processors and the chip
seizing five rows are slated to debut in
Intel's ten nanometer Lakefield lineup
by using both farbros and Amit and scho
emmab Intel claims it allows for linkage
of even more computing performance and
capability together that's their direct
quote in addition to connecting multiple
fibrous elements designers can also link
other tiles see chip lets such as analog
or memory components then there's the
new omnidirectional interconnector oti
oti is a communication framework that
combines the horizontal communication of
emmab and the vertical communication of
Favreau's ODI uses large through-silicon
vias or a TBS to communicate and deliver
power vertically through the base thigh
the larger TV asses offer less
resistance and facilitate higher
bandwidth this approach also means that
Intel can use fewer TBS's
optimizing die space well Ashley Intel
discussed a new die to die interface
known as MD i/o
MD IO is more of a modular system
composed of a library of intellectual
property blocks and is based on intel's
advanced interface bus or AIB which is a
PHY level interconnect and more on that
in the Intel newsroom sometimes we talk
about hirings in the industry and
important people Intel just to kind of
close out Intel as the news item here
for the first half because it's been
let's be honest AMD for
three months now it has hired Claire
Dixon as the corporate vice president
and chief communications officer at CCO
Claire Dixon comes from VMware actually
and served as the senior vice president
there and chief communications officer
this follows up on a lot of Intel
hirings lately most of them have been in
the graphics group Roger Chidori is
notable Tom Peterson is notable Ryan
Shrout as well and prior to this though
Dixon was the vice president of global
comms at eBay as well and has now moved
to Intel rise in can't can't go a few
hours without saying that rise in 2000
and second gen thread Ripper or getting
price cuts this is actually pretty good
news so in our 3,600 review despite how
positive we were about the 3,600 and
strongly recommended it was literally in
the title also the 2,700 2,700 X have
fallen in price to a point where they're
pretty good competition to the 3600 so
depending on what you're doing how much
you want gaming performance versus the
extra cores and threads these 2000
series chips are a good opportunity at
the new prices while they in stock
anyway they're not being made anymore to
our knowledge but we don't fully know
yet but they're going to go Yoel at some
point soon so while at the new prices
there are a good competition option to
the 3000 series outside of Intel in the
wake of Andy's rise in 3,000 launch
prices have fallen to about $160 for the
rise in 5 2600 acts which is a CP that
we actually previously gave an award for
one of the best budget options and now
that's even more true that's a hefty
discount over the original $260 price
meanwhile the r5 2600 is about 140
dollars you can buy that an overclock it
to 2600 X levels with minimal effort so
that would be a good option to save an
extra 20 bucks that's six dollars off
its initial launch price and then the
flagship r7 2,700 X has been dropped to
$250 where it launched to the $330 price
point also first generalized and where
you can find them can sometimes be
cheaper than that although you're kind
of your parting hairs at that point it
might be better to just go with second
gen if you can find them so
the second generation of thread Ripper
is getting its own price cuts as well we
even talked about this yet with the r9
3900 axe encroaching on the bottom run
of the thread Ripper mm product stack it
makes sense for Andy to drop prices in
the thread Ripper 2950 X and 29:20
brackets when the r9 3950 axe debuts in
September these price shops will make
even more sense as the chip will no
doubt further cannibalize last gen
thread Ripper the thread Ripper 2950 axe
is currently listed at 738 hundred $99
launch price alternatively aim these
2920 axe is going for 340 at B&amp;amp;H photo
the 2920 x debuted at $650 for reference
galaxy's rolling out PCIe for SSDs with
a 500 gigabyte option as well but talk
about these a bit so these are obviously
targeted for use with X 570 it's the
debut PCIe gen for platform storage is
the primary use case of PCIe gen for
there's really no no use case and
graphics writing that consumer graphics
right now so if you really need
high-speed storage gen forests where you
should be looking and people who need it
probably know they need it and if you
don't know you need it you might not so
another thing here to note briefly the
speed of the interface is not
necessarily the speed of the device so
keep that in its pretty basic stuff but
just like I say 2/3 port will not make
an old old device like I say to say to
to device operate at faster speeds just
by having a faster interface it's also
got to be a faster controller on the
device or faster memory on the device so
with the 500 gigabyte SSD this is using
the Phi's on at 50 16 east 16 controller
which is one of the faster ones so so
far what we know are that the models
from gigabyte and Corsair are the first
the debut Gen 4 models he talked about
the sabre and had one come out as well
we talked about last week
now Galax is ready to enter the as viet
uncrowded PCIe for arena as with
previous SSD is based on the new PCIe
gen for standard galaxy's new hof pro
will use the Phi's on PS 50 1616
controller and Toshiba's 96 layer 3 ETL
seen that the Galax hall-of-fame pro
based on the m2 2280 form-factor I'll be
passively cooled with an aluminum
heatsink the galaxy all of fame' pro
does manage to differentiate itself a
bit and offering a 500 gigabyte capacity
option sequential read and write speeds
vary based on model but the two terabyte
offering tops out at five gigabyte per
second read and 4.4 gigabytes per second
to write which is in line with the on
paper specs we've seen from other PCIe
for SSDs well there's no word on price
the drives are expected to hit retail
channels by the end of the month
Samsung recently confirmed that its
foundry has certified full flow tools
from both cadence and synopsis the new
tools will be used for chip designs
based on Samsung's 5 nanometer 5l PE or
low-power early knowed Samson certified
both the cadence full flow digital
solution and design tools and the
synopsis fusion design platform using
arm cortex a53 and an ARM Cortex a 57
cores quote as part of our long-standing
collaboration with cadence we've
confirmed that it's digital full flow
meets and exceeds the requirements for
designing with the 5 lpe process
technology Samsung's vice president of
design technology counted on Samson's
collaboration with synopsis and said
that quote synopsis continues to be our
vendor of choice for collaboration on
new node development and enablement so
our foundry customers can confidently
ramp their designs to volume production
in all market segments including
automotive AI high-performance computing
and mobile according to an attack the
newly certified tools include compilers
validators power circuit optimizers and
UV specific tools in our AMD rx 5700 xt
review we primarily took issue with the
blower cooler design and although you
can kind of work around some of its
issues with an easy mod it's still ideal
as we said in the video to just wait for
partner models so those partner models
are expected to launch around mid-august
and the vice president and general
manager of Radeon noted that custom Navi
cards will be here in mid-august he said
quote hey all custom AIB designs will be
hitting the market mid August in a
reddit thread noted that and also noted
some justification for the blower cooler
thought the real justification is it's
cheap that's why they did it so that's
why it was done but
the quote given was the radion group
historically has had a bad reputation of
producing product launch charts that
didn't match up real-world performance
love it or hate it the blower allowed us
to guarantee performance in every system
to match our launch charts not everyone
cools their PC as good as well maybe as
a reviewer and definitely not as well as
some of the pictures you guys have
shared it was my goal to clean all of
this up so that you can trust our
performance that you hear from us on
stage that is not true that's that is
not why I am Dee made the blower cooler
that's bullshit
so just point that out right now that's
a really good after the fact reason for
why the blower cooler was chosen the
blower cooler was chosen because it's
cheap and relatively easy to make there
might be a behind-the-scenes reason of
not wanting to step on board partners
toes whereas nvidia can kind of just say
you know what we'll do what we want and
what are you guys gonna do about it
so AMD doesn't have quite that position
with its board partners but the reason
is definitely not because it doesn't
line up with the charts otherwise
because that's just not that's not valid
some of the charts are they already have
BS in them anyway like calculating vanes
off of a peak clock that rarely happens
so that answer not valid but the thing
that matters is that the custom cards
will come out in mid-august so that's
that's the aspect of this that you could
take away from it MSI last item updating
a m4 400 series boards with 32 megabyte
BIOS chips with am these growing family
of processors backwards compatibility on
socket and four boards is becoming a
challenge for some other board vendors
in particular MSI has had issues with 16
megabyte BIOS chips on 300 400 series
motherboards to resolve this a messiah
is relaunching am for 400 series boards
with 32 megabytes chips to better
accommodate micro code updates and
storage the new msi boards will have a
new identifier on them that'll be max at
the end of it and that is that that's
how you know it's been updated with the
larger BIOS the real thing here is we
experienced this with one of our
gigabyte boards to where it sort of half
flashes the BIOS dependent which chip
you have in there and it can cause some
some issues or at least and can
it's in the best case so a320
a pro is getting updated for be 450
boards they've got be 450 pro be 450 M
pro VDH p450 gaming plus Pro Am to
mortar max tomahawk and a pro and all of
those have we already said no before 50
ma pro as well so those are all updated
with BIOS and X 470 gaming pro and
gaming plus or getting updated and it's
we're not clear yet if other models will
also get larger BIOS chips but that is
what a messiah has officially listed so
far so that's it for this one that
you're watching check back for more we
have a lot more follow uprising coverage
