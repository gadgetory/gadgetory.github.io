event for the twenty seventy twenty
eighty and twenty atti launch which
includes official specifications and
pricing from nvidia and video could have
handled the event a lot better overall
as we'll talk about momentarily but for
now we do have the core specification z'
that we can go through and some release
dates and prices before that this video
is brought to you by the EVGA CLC 280
liquid cooler people ask me how I keep
cool during the summer with all this
hair well I've tried a lot of different
products and if you do exactly what I
need many of them cause tangles or worse
EVGA CLC 280 helps keep my core
temperatures low they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
the r-tx 20 70 80 and 20 80 TI were all
officially announced today the
announcement could have been a lot
better there were many things that were
really not the best with the way NVIDIA
handled this event but perhaps that will
be discussed in a different video
just to clarify something here on the
pricing so there's two sets of pricing
that Nvidia release there's one on their
website which is for six hundred eight
hundred and twelve hundred dollars and
then there's one that was released at
the event for five hundred seven hundred
and a thousand dollars and that one had
a different slide and we think it either
coincides with the reference pricing
versus Effie pricing so there might be
two disparate SKUs or it could just be a
miscommunication we're really not sure
at this time
other than that though we do have some
prices from gigabyte which seems to
coincide more closely with the higher
prices so a gigabyte range of 790 to 834
the 2080 and 1170 to a bit more than
that for the 2080 Ti so we have some
partner card prices already it'll be
linked in the article in the description
below if you want more and September
20th for the availability of the 2088
2080 TI and the 2080 with a 20 at 70 TBD
no really stay on that just yet the
cooler is the most interesting next
thing other than hard specs and that's
because it looks like nvidia is going
for a dual axial cooler much like most
of their partners do
or have done in the past in the renders
if their representative of the real
product they have 13 blades across two
fans and they are positioned over the
vrm and over the GPO core as you would
expect so this is particularly
interesting because moving to a dual
axial cooler is going to be more similar
to what the partners do especially for
the two fan cards which means that I
don't know we could see some of the
partners getting pushed either out of
the market or towards three fan coolers
and that's probably why a lot of the
leaks coolers you saw were three fan
because Nvidia is doing this so very
interesting very interesting and curious
implications for the partners where I'll
be honest I'm a bit concerned that there
might be some Nvidia kind of pushing the
partners around or out of the market at
some of the price points where they've
existed in the past but it all depends
on how good that dual axial cooler is
that Nvidia made the leaked PCB shots
looked like 70 on power stages if that's
accurate for the 20 80 TI then that's a
pretty damn good BRM to what we also
know is that the specs for the cards
remain largely the same as what we saw
leading up to launch so just to go over
each card individually we have the 2070
up first
this one has 23:04 cuda cores CUDA cores
are just FP use so an FPU is not really
a true core and a seems closer to that
they can't do a lot of things that cores
can do they can compute but they can't
fetch and put stuff into registers from
registers can't really work with the
cache quite the same way as a core can
so you get the idea but regardless 23:04
FP use on the 27 t it's got a 17 10
megahertz boost clock and this is for
the founders Edition I need to note that
- so there are two specs for the Nvidia
cards today
there's the founders Edition and the
reference spec and the reference I
believe is what the partners will be
starting from the founders is a bit
higher so it's kind of going back to the
confusion that Nvidia created in Austin
in 2016 when we had to make a special
video clarifying what the heck founders
edition means because at the time it
actually wasn't special all it meant was
reference except renamed but now it
looks like it is going to be a bit
special in that it's got a bit of a
higher clock then the
reference back so Fe might actually go
towards what people mistakenly thought
it was in 2016 that's kind of what it
looks like right now base clock 1410 for
both reference and Fe 14 gigabits per
second memory speed 8 gigabytes of gddr5
86 bit memory interface for the 2074 48
gigabytes per second memory bandwidth
and then all of the other stuff is as
you would expect
also these cards have NV link support
which is pretty interesting too so we'll
talk about that more perhaps in a
secondary video but SLI as we know it is
going away and NV link is what's going
to be replacing it for the next card
let's talk about the 2080 I'll just go
into order here 2080 29:44 FP use or
CUDA cores as they call it 1800
megahertz boost clock 1515 base and the
reference non Fe version is 1710 for the
boost clock that's the only difference
the memory configuration is 8 gigabytes
of gddr5 14 gigahertz for a second
memory speed 256-bit memory interface
width and 448 gigabyte per second memory
bandwidth and then the 20 atti 4352 FP
use for that one pretty big and 1635
boost clock or 1545 for the reference
back as opposed to the efi spec 1350 for
the base clock same memory except 11
gigabytes 352 bit boss so 16 16
gigabytes per second and that leads us
back to a few other notes from the
presentation or things that we kind of
thought and put together while we were
watching it first one and B link for SLI
$80 for the bridge if you want it and
NVIDIA frankly hasn't done a great job
of convincing us that we need SLI or
that it's worth buying but we'll see if
that changes NV links quite a bit
different it's possible that SLI could
now come back into play with NV link if
the developers support it that's the big
question but either way it's a
difference and it's interesting the
cooler we kind of talked about a little
unsure of how that's going to affect
partners and partner relations but
Nvidia is in a dominant position in the
market and they don't really need to
worry that much about much of anything
the next part in the presentation
routinely Jenson Wan stated that the
it would take 10 10 a TTI's to keep up
with 110 Turk or one note on this that
does not mean that one GPU from a 1080i
class card one 1080 TI is going to be
that different a 10x change versus one
tenser core that's not what that means
so when they're talking about tensor
core speeds and being 10 times the speed
of as 1080i what is really being
discussed is the deep learning
capabilities machine learning ai
processing these things are a bit
different than what we deal with in
graphics so 110 a TTI does not equal
one-tenth of a touring GPU or even a
tensor cores what they're really saying
in fact what is happening is that 1
tensor core can do 10 times the work of
a 1080i in specific applications like
deep learning and machine learning so
that I just thought was important to
note because probably a lot of people
might not catch that part image
processing is a big one by the way like
if you're processing billions of images
or something like that
next one so there was a lot of time
spent talking about shadow shadow
occlusion ray tracing recaps of the
event from March all the same
information
tureens been in development for 10 years
according to the CEO on stage and it's
the second largest ever made behind the
v100 for the quadric class high-end cars
that were revealed previously the SM is
brand new it can do independent fpn
enter a integer operations to split
color and address processing how that
affects gaming or if it affects gaming
TBD the next thing of note here so
another item in the presentation 2x
speed of a 1080 Ti but only with 4k DLS
s mode enabled so one of the slides that
show it's a 2x speed of a 1080i that may
well certainly be true and probably is
but the specific instance that was true
was with 4k resolution with a new
special mode enabled and this is similar
to what we saw with the 1080i where yeah
and 4k it was pretty substantially
advantaged over the 1080 so not saying
that it's misleading it really wasn't
they had it on the screen it was pretty
obvious but I did want to make sure that
everyone in the audience caught what was
on the screen which is that the 2x speed
is under specific circumstances next one
the phone number
that was on the screen that was part of
the joke was our TX 2080 so that name
was revealed pretty early on the DG x4
Voltas so DG axe had four volts is on it
processing that starwars image that was
shown a long time ago half a year ago
and the frame time for that was 55
milliseconds one taurine card was 45
milliseconds they wanted to point that
out pascal was 308 and had an 8x claims
difference by nvidia and also a taurine
frame assembly so if we talk about the
pipeline for touring frames with tracing
one of these like Star Wars type images
its raytrace integer 32 shading FP 32
shading and DNN processing it is semi
asynchronous so FP 32 shading happens
during the entire frame we have a block
diagram of it and ray tracing and
integer 32 happens simultaneously with
FP 32 this is important as we saw with a
Titan V asynchronous compute is taking a
big step forward for NVIDIA in this
generation so we talked about it then we
confirmed it with Nvidia at the time
asynchronous compute is if you're kind
of looking past all the ray tracing
stopping at just the hard performance
numbers async compute is going to be
where it's at for this car to this
generation assuming it's integrated
properly with Vulcan or whatever the
case may be DNA and generates pixels
that haven't been finished yet that's
kind of interesting so new information
with AI will be generated by the card so
that it can finish frame is faster and
leave some pixels unfinished and then
fill them in synthetically also there's
a new weighted number of tera r-tx ops
they're calling it which is a waiting
for FP 32 and teraflops per gig array so
they went with Tara RTX ops and one note
was they said 78 tera r-tx offs for the
twenty Bedi I would assume Ti or
basically touring card versus 12 tera
r-tx ops it's a mouthful for Titan ax
did not specify which Titan ax there are
three or four of them so I could have
used that clarification there and I
think that pretty much covers it so big
things here to talk about partner impact
how does a dual fan axial card impact
what the partners make this generation I
think we're gonna see a lot of three fan
cards as a result
and probably depending on the price
floor for them it's going to be harder
to compete with nvidia at the absolute
low end another potential point of
impact pascal and AMD neither of which
have the capabilities for processing
things like rate racing that the touring
cards that do so as rate racing becomes
an actual thing in real time if it does
in this generation there's a bit of a
concern where if you have it enabled
it's probably gonna kill the performance
on both pascal and andy so it's not just
an anti andy move its anti everything
that's not touring which is fine that's
progress and that's how technology moves
it's just that keep in mind just like
with all the other high-end effects with
any game that's come out whether it's an
AMD effect or an nvidia effect you'll
have to disable it to improve the
performance on older generation cards
not that new but something with noting
ray-tracing is the next kind of
skeptical point where this requires
developer integration RT x is an nvidia
thane it's an sdk that will allow
developers to more or less plug-and-play
real time ray tracing but even still
even with it being three programs it
takes a while for developers to make
that commitment games take years to
develop
and they probably haven't had access to
the SDK for a significant period of time
it's been months for sure but not on the
scale of years as far as we're aware so
it could be a while before real time
rate racing games other than what was
shown on stage the couple of them there
were really take market share and that
means that the rate racing stuff might
not be super relevant for this
generation or at least this launch but
perhaps the future ones next big
question what happens with the 2050
class card do the tensor cores on that
have enough oomph to really actually do
real-time ray tracing in any meaningful
way so lots of stuff to think about with
this launch but that's it for this one
subscribe for more well definitely have
more videos on this as we process the
