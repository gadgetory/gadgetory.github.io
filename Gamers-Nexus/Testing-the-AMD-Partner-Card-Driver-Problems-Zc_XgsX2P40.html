the asus strix vega card but we've been
unable to review it until a time at
which asus and AMD come to a conclusion
of vio is functioning properly with
drivers we then got the power color card
in the red devil and had some similar
issues with it prior to the most recent
driver update 11.4 and what we're doing
today is looking at these three cards to
see if it's finally time to review them
because it's getting pretty close to
consumer availability and that means
that there needs to be reviews online so
all we're doing today is checking the
frequency response using different
driver revisions on these three
different cards and different V BIOS
revisions in some cases to determine if
AMD and their board partners have
resolved the issues of drivers and the
clocks not quite working properly
before we get into that this content is
brought to you by the Thermaltake Flow
RGB closed-loop liquid cooler which is a
three hundred sixty millimeter radiator
plus three one twenty fans that are RGB
illuminated if then we'll take it ring
fans at that this is a 4.5 done a detect
pump which is one of the faster pumps
you can learn more at the link in the
description below so let's establish the
basics here it's been pretty exhausting
going back and forth with all the board
partners and AMD trying to figure out
when can we review these cards
we've been waiting because here's the
thing when we get the product in we've
got a few options and one is if we're
bar good obviously there's that's it end
of story if we're not embargoed
it becomes a question of when does it
make sense to review it for the consumer
if I reviewed this thing like almost two
months ago and we got it it would be
completely irrelevant information by the
time it ships because it hasn't shipped
yet but it will soon should by end of
year and obviously that information
would be so old that's completely
irrelevant so we wait and obviously that
gives the vendors time to fix problems
or to improve performance if there are
no problems to fix so that's what we've
done now because it's getting time for
these to launch it's five times review
them so people actually know what
they're getting so we're looking back at
this one again and we're looking at the
red devil verse
is retesting the Vegas 64 reference card
the big things here to look at are the
frequencies so the frequency reporting
in driver version 17 dot 11.3 was broken
to a point of actually not just
reporting but Andy even lists this as a
problem as a known issue on their
website so it's real issue and it's
known by Andy
so they've fixed some of that in 17th
out 11.4 but not all it the rationally
fakes an adrenaline or whatever the next
major driver update is we've heard
rumors of December from people who
aren't at AMD so secondhand information
but that'll fix most of it can't wait
forever though with cars are shipping
soon so 17.10.2011 teen dot 11 X so that
was the conundrum now we're testing for
frequency so let's let's just establish
the frequency first and see if any of
them actually clock properly the red
devil and the asu's card should
theoretically clock a bit higher than
the reference card the pen which be bios
is used so we'll look at that first with
just firestrike for now this is a
frequency chart of the reference rx Vega
64 card from AMD using driver version 17
dot 11.4 and the first bios which
position with stock settings the spikes
will be uniform across all devices
because the test is recorded from an
automated suite of all 3d marked fire
strike an x by benchmarks that we
scripted here's the asus strix card with
the latest speed bios revision from a
few weeks ago the card is reporting
frequencies adjust below the reference
card about 20 megahertz deficit on
average but the question remains whether
that's a reporting bug or even accurate
reporting or if it's actually
performance so we'll have to look at
performance for that which we'll do
momentarily and calls back to our
initial vega review where people thought
they were overclocking for example to
1900 megahertz which wasn't happening
but the frequency would report that way
so there is a clear history of incorrect
frequency reporting on Andy drivers
right now which means that we don't
actually know if it's really slower or
if it's just reported incorrectly you
will have to test it next this next line
is for the power color red devil card
when using a pre-production v bios
switch set number three to the far right
switch position and this is Justus he
behaves differently from production the
frequency jumps up to about 80 to 100
megahertz higher than reference at times
and it's consistent in its additional
performance that's more from removing
the power limitation than actual pre
overclocks this next line is the middle
switch for the power color card which
they define as a balanced mode the
clocks are reporting a bit higher
frequency than reference at times but
are mostly tied we tend to be equal or
about ten megahertz higher finally
here's the silent mode for the power
color line this one is nearly the same
as balanced mode though maybe one to
five megahertz lower the differences in
clock here are with invariance and error
at this point as the power color spec
actually defines the clock as the same
for all three BIOS revisions if you're
asking then why the higher power target
one is clocking higher it's simply
because it has a higher power budget not
because they've actually pre overclocked
at higher but that's just how the boost
mode works the same frequency target is
applied to balanced silence and OC and
that sixteen thirty megahertz core with
945 megahertz
HBM - the only real differences are the
fan targets and the power budget this
table shows all of the power color
switch differences highlighting a 40
watt increase to tgp with OC mode and
varying temperature targets that dictate
the fan curb and here's how that relates
to scoring in game this is sniper leap
forward direct x12 nicing compute 4k
resolution in high settings this game is
one of the most sensitive to any changes
on anthe hardware so should show the
differences if they exist the reference
at Vega 64 card with 17.11.2013 and 51
with older drivers 1781 the Vega 64 card
got about 58 FPS average so we've seen
some uplift on 17 at 11.40 engine all
for the ACS card the
somebody briefly recommended testing on
17 10.1 this is prior to the launch of
11.4 so we did that on 17 out 10.1 we
were seeing a measurably better
performance than on 17 not 11.3 and this
was consistent and pretty much all games
that we tested the performance is
roughly equal to 17 not 11.4 so whatever
was broken in dot 3 seems to have been
resolved and that 3 did have more known
clock reporting bugs so that's part of
that though 79 11.4 has some of its own
problem still they're just not as severe
this would explain part of the
performance disparity regardless of the
minor differences here the asus card is
not able to exit margin of error for
differences between reference and we
typically do see differences for AIB
partner cards that are greater than the
tolerance for error the power colored
card for instance plots 61 to 64 FPS
here depend on which meet BIOS were
using and for the red devil we are
seeing an actual difference with the
higher TDP on switch number 3 we're
measuring a gain of about six point nine
percent on the red devil over the
reference 64 on 17 to 11 dot for you
didn't switch number to balance mode
we're at 3.2 percent so it's outside of
error but not by much well enough but
it's definitely working that's the point
and that's a start the Strix card seems
somewhat stuck but we can't confidently
state why that is if it's expected or if
it's an AMD a sign-off issue of some
kind that remains to be seen
so to recap in some of the tests
depending on what they were the asus
card was originally doing better on 1710
that one then dot 11.3 the version in
dot 11.4 fixed some of these problems
and the major difference here is that
power color is actually plotting more
change so we're seeing up to 7 percent
performance uplift with the higher TGV
switch that's actually more wattage 40
more watts available to the GPU which is
why you see that change and then other
than this it seems like power colors is
pretty much working on 17 11.4 there are
more issues on dot 3 then now so I think
we're ready to test this card and review
properly you can look for that soon the
asu's card still has an issue so at this
point we're waiting for a soos to ship
the card make it available for pre-order
or something like that
at which point consumers can get it so
we're gonna review it or for ASIS -
hopefully before launch say we figured
out the problem it was this handshake
with our card and and these drivers or
whatever we fixed it here's a better
version so yeah that's what we're kind
of waiting on right now let's look at
fire strike scores briefly - just kind
of reinforce what we've seen thus far
fire strikes next for fire strike ultra
the power color Vega 64 with the OC
switch is hitting 56 21 points averaged
over multiple passes this drakes falls
down to below reference levels of
performance when using drive versions 17
11.4 and dot three especially and this
is repeatable over multiple passes the
maximum performance Delta between the
lowest score and the highest-scoring
single card is 6.5 percent that's not
huge and we're targeting single-digit
FPS changes but the drivers are clearly
interacting with the Strix card in very
specific and potentially incorrect ways
with fire strike extreme the power color
card lands at top again with the OC
switch at 11,000 22 points clearly
demonstrating that the over power
Headroom is outputting higher o'clock so
things are working properly and the
clocks are reporting at least relative
to each other properly we don't know if
there are a hundred percent accurate and
can't really be sure but based on
performance we can see that they are at
least somewhat relative to each other
accurate so that's our 80 to 100 Hertz
increase from earlier the maximum
performance change is still about 5.2
percent increase for the best power
color number versus the worst number on
the charge and the performance win and
FPS would range from 55 to 58 FPS with
the fire strike test just to give you a
frame of reference that we won't make a
chart for that the Strix card is once
again performing it worse than the
reference card which we think comes down
to some kind of driver handshake with
fire strike 1080p the scaling is
identical to what we saw before showing
a performance range of 4.5% from top to
bottom we'll also include times by
numbers linked in the article in the
description below if you want to see
those so that's really it this is pretty
easy video the power color
is ready to review we don't normally do
a preview test to validate if it's time
to review them but the idea here is to
set the stage so everyone's clear on how
the drivers interact with a different
cards so it there's a good understanding
of why we're reviewing what we are when
we are to recap this is ready to go
we'll review it very soon already tested
this and retested it with the newest
drivers so these will be on a level
ground we are focusing on out of box
testing we will do overclock testing
power consumption and the usual suite
noise testing all that stuff with the
power colored card this one we've done
thermals on but the challenge is that at
this point we're just waiting to do the
game testing and we will only wait up
until a point that you can buy the card
or up until the point that asus tells us
is ready and in a final state for review
until then there's no point in reviewing
it because it won't represent the final
product and if we're just publishing it
two weeks ahead of the launch of that
product that changes a day before launch
then we'd have three do it all anyway
and it's just going to be easier for
everyone if we wait but only so long so
that's everything that's Vega it's
taking a long time to get to this point
Andy has had supply limitations and
issues so partner cards are scarce to
begin with and then they haven't worked
for like two months but we don't know
whose fault that is we don't know if
that's AMD we don't know if that's the
board partners it could have something
to do with the V bio signature that was
introduced it could have entirely
nothing to do with that and be all about
the drivers it could be the board
partners building the BIOS with lower
clocks than we expect I don't know but
hopefully it's fixed and check back
