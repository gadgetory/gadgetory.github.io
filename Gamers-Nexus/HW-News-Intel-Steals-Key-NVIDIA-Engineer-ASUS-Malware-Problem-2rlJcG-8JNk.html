hardware news recap the leading story
for this week is Intel poaching
distinguished engineer Tom Peterson from
Nvidia this is a major news item it's
important for a lot of reasons even if
you don't follow industry people because
tom has been an internal advocate at
Nvidia and has made some pushes for
things that consumers or media or
partners have concerns demands or
questions about internally so Nvidia is
losing that person also a key engineer
and this is where Intel's building
battle against the two incumbent GPU
makers expands because Intel has been
already acquiring AMD talent media
reporter talent and is now pulling
people from Nvidia so that'll be our
leading story for today before that this
video is brought to you by EVGA SZ 390
dark motherboard the Z 390 dark is a
flagship motherboard for Intel's
unlocked case cue CPUs with tuning done
by overclocked engineering team at
kingpin and 10 to enable higher memory
and CPU frequencies the motherboard uses
a unique rotated socket design to move
EPS 12-volt cables to the right side
making cable management easier and also
sticks to two DIMM slots to improve
memory overclocking stability and
Headroom we previously analyzed the BRM
and full and found it among the best in
class 4 z 390 overclocking and it also
got rid of RGB LEDs learn more at the
link in the description below
quick GN store update first we just
restocked the blue beer glasses so if
you want one of the cobalt blue beer
glasses with the gold tinted rim you can
go to store it on cameras nexus net pick
them up in 1 2 or 4 packs for discounts
as you go up and those will be there for
you if you want them so Nvidia losing a
key engineer to Intel this let me tell
you why you need to care about this
first Tom Peterson as I said has been an
internal advocate for media and this
means every company sort of has at least
one person who is a hub for transacting
between the corporate people at the
company and the people outside of the
company and that hub or that conduit is
critical if they're good at their job
because they keep the rest of the
company sort of slightly in check to
some extent or
least in touch with the audience and as
companies grow they do lose touch with
what the audience wants because they
don't need to care anymore when they're
in a dominating position so NVIDIA
losing tom is both exciting and
concerning on the exciting side intel
has now demonstrated that it's serious
enough to start pulling on talent from
the biggest GPU maker in the space and
it is starting by pulling on someone who
is to our knowledge a direct report to
Jensen or extremely close if not so
that's a that's a big move that's a
power play by Intel and the upside of
that is that Nvidia desperately needs
competition because Nvidia does act in a
very controlling fashion with with its
board partners with media and this is a
concerning thing Nvidia also though is
in this process losing someone who does
help keep the company in touch with the
rest of the world and so the concerning
side then and videos front is that we
don't know what's gonna happen for
example the overclocking we don't know
that tom was pretty involved with
overclocking tom was also involved with
building the boost algorithm was
involved with building benchmarking
software and things like FCAT if you
remember that he was he was big on
pushing frame time analysis which of
course we use heavily now big on pushing
VR benchmarking software and building it
and did some engineering work on how the
clock behaves for NVIDIA GPUs has also
listened very seriously to points we've
had and others have had about
overclocking on NVIDIA hardware and
locking Nvidia hardware and things like
that so losing that conduit is we're not
sure how that will impact Nvidia in
future generations now these engineers
when they leave you have to remember
that they they have already been working
on the next product that's not out yet
so the impact from Raja at AMD the
impact from Tom at Nvidia that's going
to carry on for at least another
generation although will lessen as time
goes on but the the immediate change is
that Intel will be gaining
an important engineer so technically at
time of filming this news is not public
but we have confirmed it with parties at
both companies so yeah this is a this is
a a big deal at this point we're not
quite sure what'll happen but in the
very least it looks like Intel is quite
to be a serious competitor to Nvidia and
then the big question after this is you
know the these people that Intel is
pulling on they all have influence they
have friends in the industry and you'll
notice that those people start coming on
board afterward it last week or two
weeks ago we had a news story about
Intel hiring Kyle Bennett from hard OCP
yeah I think some of you misunderstood
the hiring press thing and thought that
it was like paying for reviews that's
not what it was they literally hired
Kyle Bennett like he doesn't he doesn't
really run hard OCP anymore so it's been
mothballed less he said so Kyle Bennett
works at Intel Ryan Shrout works at
Intel Roger Kaduri we're excited Intel
Chris hook we're excited Intel all these
people know each other and Allen mal
ventano an excellent well former writer
on SSD reviews and now an employee of
Intel also works at Intel as I said so
Intel has been really expanding its
tendrils and pulling all these people on
and all these people no other people so
the question then is who does Tom pull
on if anyone from Nvidia that's really
what we're wondering is do any engineers
follow and really start to build a
serious GPU division at Intel that has a
lot of experience has worked at on
various successful and unsuccessful
products both are important points on a
resume because you know what failure is
and you know what success is so it's
it's very interesting and even if you
don't really care about who industry
people are which is valid if you don't
know their names this is a major
development and we'll see we'll see
Intel's going to be a very interesting
company over the next few years anyway I
told you so that's the next story asus
has been distributing malware
accidentally there's a few things ACS
has done lately that
we've complained publicly about and one
of the biggest ones that we mentioned
maybe your to ago was when ASU started
using new update tools and started
pre-installing almost like rootkits into
the flash into flash that they put on
motherboards so that when you booted a
system for the first time it would pop
up all these driver install tools now on
the surface that looks like a nice
consumer thing because it helps someone
who doesn't know what they're doing to
install drivers for the first time
beyond that the concern becomes that
you've now put storage on the
motherboard and if that becomes
exploitable and it will be exploitable
then you've now made a way for malware
to revive itself after the OS has been
cleared because it's on the motherboard
so that's the biggest thing we
complained about with Asus and its
security in recent years and that's not
even what we're talking about today but
it's probably something we're going to
be talking about again when it's
exploited and becomes an attack vector
for malware if it hasn't been already so
anyway Asus has done some some pretty
not great things on the security front
according to Kaspersky Lab Asus is a
live update utility was recently
hijacked and it was used to spread
malware that became known as shadow
hammer so hammer is a malicious back
door at masquerades as a quote critical
security update and it is now estimated
to have affected over 1 million users
Asus being a leading vendor in the
market this is obviously a problem the
threat was detected in January and it's
estimated to have taken place between
June and November of 2018 so you could
be affected if you're using Asus
hardware making the attack so tricky to
detect was the fact that the the trojan
eyes do utility used authentic
certificates a suits tech computer
incorporated certificates and was hosted
on Asus servers that do the updates so
asus has since issued a press release
and also a legitimate security update
it's also issued a diagnostic tool that
users can use to determine if they are
affected
and what was not issued however was an
apology what was not issued was an
indication that Asus is taking the
matter overly serious and the press
release attempts to actually water down
the findings of the security firm that
discovered the attack according to
Kaspersky shadow hammer may be the
largest supply chain attack ever
discovered rivaling the shadow pad and
ccleaner attacks and is obviously of
concern so if you have this ASU software
installed the live update utility you
may want to get rid of it and you may
also want to use the ACS published
Diagnostics tool to see if you're
affected here because it does affect a
lot of people this isn't human like a
browse safely thing and you'll be fine
this is a if it's on your computer you
might not be fine so also if there's if
you're using a board with Asus firmware
that's another point of concern for the
future just keep that in mind
bad moves by asus on the security front
Intel ninth gen processors transitioning
to a new stepping so Intel uses revised
steppings to correct errors in the
processors they use them to augment some
of the properties of the processors
clock speeds minor voltage changes
things like that and you'll see stepping
sometimes we're in the overclocking
community you might hear that one
stepping is superior to others for
overclocking for various reasons maybe
process maturity or just because of
changes in errata they're prepping the
platforms for the new ninth gen
processors within an hour zero stepping
moving from p0 previously according to
Asus the newer chips using the RZ or
stepping ID will be coming in the second
quarter thus far there's no indication
as to what the new stepping will bring
specifically but as stated it's
typically errata changes small changes
to clocks things like that Intel will
also issue a specification update to
detail the changes when the time has
come so once the processors are actually
here we'll know what's changing
Samsung tempers earning expectations
amidst a memory price decline something
we've been talking out for a few weeks
now so and what has been
an unprecedented move for Samsung the
company recently released a statement or
a warning rather that its first quarter
earnings expectations are anticipated to
miss the mark quote the company expects
the scope of price declines and main
memory chip products to be larger than
expected and this is something we noted
in our last episode where memory prices
are currently in a freefall with prices
expected to hit lows not seen since 2011
also affecting Samson's earnings are the
sluggish demand for display panels which
represents another sizable chunk of
Samson's business prices for both memory
and display panels specifically OLED are
expected to rebound though in the second
half of the year and as noted by Samsung
officials it has never before offered a
statement before earnings reports
however after having to revise the
earnings guidance for fourth quarter 18
and again for the first quarter of 19
due to memory prices Samsung has
evidently decided it was time to break
its code of silence according to
industry profits and clairvoyants digit
times PCIe SSD s are becoming more
ubiquitous and look to be experiencing a
surge to 50 percent market share in 2019
this will also achieve market share
parity with 2.5 inch SSDs on the SATA
interface and is a big move the looming
NAND oversupply and steep production and
memory prices have led to 512 gigabyte
PCIe SSD prices falling off by 11
percent in the first quarter of 2019 and
two of these six gigabyte options often
see similar price drops and have in the
past couple of months throughout the
year 1 terabyte models are expected to
come down as well further narrowing the
on established price disparity between
SATA and PCIe protocols we previously
reported about Intel and micron parting
ways on the joint venture to develop
non-volatile memory with each company
agreeing to pursue new things people
pursue new non-volatile memory interests
independently and in tile with octane
and 3d crosspoint while micron would
follow on with quantex so it was a
mutual departure this however got a bit
messy because Doyle river is one of the
Intel engineers who jumped ship to
micron
allegedly brought Intel IP and trade
secrets in tow to micron as moving over
so this is old news at this point but
what's new is that Intel has filed the
lawsuit against rivers and rivers micron
and Intel have been locked in a legal
dispute since the filing most recently
Intel was awarded a court order that
states Rivers quote shall not possess
use or disclose any confidential
proprietary or trade secret Intel
documents related to 3d crosspoint or
Intel's obtained branded products
including about personnel working on
those products that he acquired while
working for Intel and that contain
information Intel has not disclosed
outside of Intel except under
non-disclosure agreement protecting its
confidentiality
additionally the court order gives
rivers three days to return any data
that may be in his possession pursuant
to the court order and Intel's lawsuit
according to his attorney the embattled
Rivers has nothing to return nor hide
quote mr. rivers doesn't have anything
to return this is from Daniel Sakaguchi
an attorney defending rivers my
apologies on the pronunciation quote we
continue to take the position that
Intel's claims are greatly exaggerated
Intel's allegations are that rivers
brought the USB drive out of Intel when
departing Intel with sensitive
information on it
rivers refutes those allegations
unsurprisingly and states that the files
are of personal or sentimental value to
him and in no way constituted any IP or
trade secret theft the register has a
thorough breakdown of the events so far
so if you want to learn more we'll link
their article in our show notes below
but that's kind of the news up to now of
this event DNA sequencing that
successfully used as a storage medium
how long until this one is exploited for
malware perhaps we could ask Asus
apparently DNA makes for a pretty good
memory substrate sponsored by DARPA and
Microsoft several scientists at the
University of Washington demonstrated
proof of concept of DNA as a storage
medium the quote was our device encodes
data into a DNA sequence which is then
written to a DNA boy
uh oligonucleotide oligonucleotide using
a custom DNA synthesizer pooled for
liquid storage and red using a nano pour
sequencer and a novel minimal
preparation protocol we demonstrate an
automated five bite right store and read
cycle with a modular design enabling
expansion as new technology becomes
available so using this system a simple
five byte message hello was written and
successfully stored and read out without
data loss over a period of 21 hours
scientists have long touted the
potential for DNA as a storage medium
and its potential over silicon and
magnetic tape scientists and companies
like Intel micron and Microsoft are all
invested in DNA storage most of the
world's archival data is stored on
magnetic tape but there's hope that
someday in the not so distant future DNA
will become the de-facto archival
storage technology so that's it for this
