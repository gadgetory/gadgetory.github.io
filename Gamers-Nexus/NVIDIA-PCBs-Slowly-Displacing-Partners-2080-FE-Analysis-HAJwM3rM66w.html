hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the party X
2080 front founders edition PCB so
there's not really much else to say
let's get right into it with identifying
all of our major voltage regulators
before that this video is brought to you
by us and the limited edition foil graft
logo shirt this four color foil shirt is
the iconic GN graft logo with average
one percent and point one percent bar
colors it's printed on a soft
high-quality and custom made 100% cotton
shirt and is available on store dye
Karen's Nexus net until stock runs out
once it's gone we will not be making
more of these shirts we sold out within
two weeks of our previous
limited-edition shirts so click on the
link below to preorder now first up we
have of course the V Corps vrm which is
the largest and most important because
it powers the GPU core and that
obviously uses the bulk of the power on
a GPU above that we find the memory the
memory of erm so that's V mem over here
and that of course powers the GDD r6
memory chips and below that we had the V
core right there over in this corner
over the card we welcome corner yeah
basically a corner we have three smaller
voltage regulators these would be for
the 1.8 volts and I'm not actually
labeling the specific regulator's here
because I don't know which ones which
but there will be a 1.8 volts rail up X
rail and a USBC rail so the 1.8 volt
rail is for a supporting as a supporting
voltage for the GDD r6 memory chips it
also it also powers and videos BIOS
chips those run off of 1.8 volts as well
Peck's rail is for the PCIe interface as
well as some internal PLL's on the GPU
core and then the USBC rail is of course
for the USB C port on the back of the
i/o since you can't actually well you
need a voltage regulator for that rail
and then over here we also have what I
assume is 5 volts because
these power stages run off of five volts
so you need power you need a vrm for the
bigger vrn funny how that works out now
then with all of those you know identify
let's get into some of the details of
the two main ones which are the V Corps
and the memory of erm so the V Corps
here is a one two three four five six
seven eight phase and this is actually
completely reasonable because we do
actually have an eight phase voltage
controller here that's actually not that
new for high end and video cards I mean
the 1080 T I already have used a u p95
11 which was an 8 phase voltage
controller here we have the successor of
the 95 11 the 95 12 which is also an
eight phase-- but adds on a few more
features it goes up to two megahertz
switching frequency which is not useful
because at that point your V RMS
efficiency is going to be terrible but
the idea is that basically if you are
using a doubling scheme or a quadrupling
scheme you can run that really really
high switching frequency into your
doublers or quadruple errs and on the
other end of those it'll either end up
as 1 megahertz or 500 kilohertz at which
point that's actually a reasonable
frequency to run into various MOSFETs
and power stages so that's some of the
reasoning behind why some voltage
controllers can go up to ridiculous
switching frequencies when you wouldn't
ever want to run anything that high into
any of the the power stages that are
being used with them so it goes up to 2
megahertz the other major addition with
the U P 9512 is that it has an SM bus
interface which previously there was no
no digital interface whatsoever on the U
P 95 11 that that thing basically the
only interface it used which the U P 95
12 still uses was a PWM vid and
basically PWM vid is a is a PWM PWM
signal that comes from the GPU core into
the voltage controller and that is used
for setting the core voltage you can't
actually ask the u p95 like in in the
past with the U P 95 11 it wasn't
actually possible to ask the 95 11
what voltage it's actually outputting
like it was not possible to do that and
so basically your software voltage
reading was basically whatever the
driver was telling the chip to produce
not what the chip was actually producing
which is just kind of an interesting
side note about how the ten series cards
worked but the 9512 can actually report
things like the RM current output
you know voltage output voltage you can
change the switching frequency you can
change the load line calibration you can
change all of this over the digital the
the SM bus that it has only issue is as
far as I know actually writing to it
might be disabled by and by default and
there's no public register maps for the
chip so good luck with accessing that
though elmore is there is going to be an
Elmore EVC which is basically a little I
Square C controller which actually hooks
up to the to the SM bus on this and
that'll give you those kinds of settings
and the reason why that works is elmore
works at asus so he has access to the
button and to the NDA data sheets which
include things like you know register
maps so yeah there will be like there
will be ways to actually get control of
all those features it's just not very
easy because again you'll have to solder
onto the GPU in order to use an elm or
EVC anyways this does mean that we have
a real eight phase vrm here and it's not
doing any of the weirdness that say the
13 phase monstrosity of the twenty atti
is doing because i like that is just odd
matter phase account is literally but
eight phases is a pretty normal phase
account that's completely reasonable to
you know get out of a you p95 12 because
it does actually support this phase
account now for the phases themselves
you're looking at just one inductor and
one power stage in each phase and the
power stages and videos favorite 70 amps
smart power stage from Fairchild
Semiconductor the FDM f31
70 so that's 70 amps and it's a smaller
power stage the reason why it's
considered a smart power
stage and not just a power stage is
because it integrates current monitoring
and temperature monitoring functionality
directly into the chip and that also
includes over current protection and
over temperature protection the over
temperature protection is not exactly a
hard protection as it basically just
raises a flag but the overcurrent
protection will actually just straight
up shut the ERM down if you overload it
so it's pretty neat you can't actually
well you'd have a hell of a time trying
to bring this vrm out because it should
shut down before you manage to do that
they also have some inbuilt protections
for various mental functions so in
theory which also the you p95 the the
new new vault some of the new voltage
controllers also have some
functionalities that work in and with
that well basically if one of the phases
on the vrm goes down in theory the vrm
could keep operating as long as the
malfunction isn't one of those where
basically the 12 volts on this side of
the vrm ends up shorting through the
power stage to this side of the VRM at
which point you're screwed because
everything on this side of the vrm which
is primarily the GPU core is going to be
very very dead though that is a well
it's not exactly a rare malfunction for
a vrm but it's it's it doesn't quite
have like it's not exactly something you
should be particularly concerned about
because it's like it like the arms don't
tend to malfunction that often they
don't get tend to get overloaded that
often especially not when they look like
this but it is a realistic like it is a
real failure mode that can occur and
does cause major issues because well
then you end up with cards where even if
you try to repair them well this is dead
anyway with the FD MF 31 70s here you
know that's those kinds of sera
scenarios are actually much less likely
because of all the built-in protections
that they have now the next thing that
is kind of interested and so the end
result of using the FD MF 31 70s here is
that the VR M here gets a pretty good
efficiency at least within the current
ranges where would normally operate
there are you know of course custom PCB
RT X 20 80s which have more powerful
VRMs but the thing is you won't really
notice that difference until you're
pushing way more current than in RTX
2080 should ever really need so let's
get into those of yaaram sort of the
heat output figures now unfortunately
the FDM f31 70 is entirely spectat 1.8
volts I did scale it down to 1.2 volts
using a datasheet for a 60 amp
international rectifier 3575 power stage
just because that's like a nice modern
60 amp power stage it should be
relatively good for trying to get the
like should be relatively close to the
real-world efficiency scaling of this
thing compared to say some older power
stages which would have actually have a
well worse worse time handling the
higher voltages because I am pretty sure
that these are very much designed for
the Intel skylake Zeon's more so than
they are designed for NVIDIA GPUs even
though currently these are especially
popular on NVIDIA GPUs and I've not
really seen a bunch of Intel
motherboards with B's on them yet so
let's thought to get into those
efficient into those heat output figures
so starting at 200 amps and also worth
noting is the switching frequency in the
datasheet
is spectat 500 kilohertz they also spec
like 750 megahertz and no
750 kilohertz 1 megahertz and I do
believe 1.5 megahertz so you know they
do go up to higher frequencies but
realistically this is going to be
running 500 kilohertz now 500 kilohertz
switching frequency 1.8 volts output
you're going to be looking at 200 amps
with a heat output of about 23 watts at
1.2 volts you'd be looking at about 18
watts now for comparison the FT w3 from
EVGA with its 12 phase VR I'm using the
exact same power stage would actually be
doing about 17 watts at one point at the
1.2 volts right at the 1.2 volts output
and about 21 watts at the 1.8 volts
output so very small difference like
we're talking single-digit you know
improvement in vrm a single-digit lower
heat output for the vrm on the F
w3 and that's after it adds a whole
extra four phases but the reason for
that is rather simple at low current
outputs the majority of your power loss
is not gonna be due to the current it's
gonna be you to just running the power
stages and well you know basically you
can't have basically the issue is that
if as your current out like your V RMS
heat output is not going to be zero when
the current output of the V R M is zero
it's gonna burn power just to run even
if it's not actually pushing any current
and at low currents that actually means
you're burning a ton of power doing a
whole lot of nothing at higher currents
your primary power loss is going to be
just all over the current going through
the power stage of producing a bunch of
heat and then having a lot more phases
actually starts being more useful which
we will soon see as for 300 amps output
this vrm would produce about 42 watts of
heat and about 34 watts scaled down but
aft w3 at that same output would be
producing about 28 watts of heat for 1.2
volts so you'd be looking at about seven
watt reduction no six watt reduction at
1.2 volts in the RM heat output by
having the twelve phase instead of this
eight phase now going up further 400
amps output and we're gonna get to where
these current ratings go 400 amps output
you'd be looking at about reading the
long set of notes 68 watts of heat and
about 54 watts of heat at 1.2 volts
output the FT w3 for comparison would be
doing about 40 on that 1.2 volts output
at this point like we're talking about a
pretty major difference that's 14 watts
you know less power consumption that's
almost that's probably close to half the
amount of power that all of the GDD r6
on this card uses so yeah that is that
you know that starts being a significant
difference in power consumption right
there and then the highest current
rating that the datasheet really makes
easy to calculate because while these
are technically 70m powers
they only speck the datasheet up to 60
amps which is kind of normal 60 amp
power stages normally end their data
sheets at 55 amps and then the lower I
am stuff that actually ends where the
current rating ends but for these 70 M
power stages they stop at 60 so 480 amps
for you know 60 times 8 that's just kind
of easy to calculate here so 1.8 volts
you'd be looking at about 96 watts of
heat which is like a loft and then at
one point two volts you'd be looking at
about 77 watts of heat for comparison
the FT w3 would be doing 500 amps
because that's a 12 phase so I actually
had an easy time calculating the 500 amp
figure and didn't have to go to 480 the
the 12 phase FTW 3 would be doing 500
amps at about 72 watts of heat output
for 1.8 volts and for 1.2 volts it would
have been doing a it would be doing 58
so basically at 500 amps output the FT
w3 the RM would be producing about as
much heat as this produces at 400 amps
output of course at the reasonable
current ranges like this is
realistically I don't think like on
water cooling you really shouldn't be
able to break that 300 M figure so you
know so 200 amps is around stock and
somewhere between 200 amps and 300 amps
is gonna be like your usual overclocking
range so stock to sort of h2o and I'd
say 300 amps you to already be a store
or starting to look into like dry ice
range cooling you know so stock well I
should have also included air cooling
because there's obviously custom air
coolers and those are pretty good there
and so you know really you'd already be
pretty much like this vrm is pretty good
for everything except maybe ln2
and really even with the liquid nitrogen
you know you'd probably not hit that 480
am figured you'd still be probably
somewhere in the 400 amp range maybe
even lower 1080 tea eyes would actually
go into the sort of 400 amp range and
this is technically a bigger die but it
may not scale to as high voltages as a
1080 tea I did you could push like 1.5 5
volts in
a 1080i or even 1.6 if you had them
really well cooled with this thing
you're really not gonna like it if this
ends up running on less voltage then you
know you're not gonna hit that amount of
current pull so even on liquid nitrogen
you'd still not be you know in that
really uncomfortable for Hut like that
this is a lot of heat and even this is
already a loss of heat though obviously
you'd be somewhere in between these two
figures on the liquid nitrogen but uh
with these you know high higher heat
outputs it's not like you'd really be
limited even on liquid nitrogen with the
with the eight phase here you could
maybe marginally have a slightly cooler
running vrm with the twelve phase on
like the FTW three well practically
speaking you wouldn't really see much of
a difference this wouldn't really this
vrm shouldn't really stop you even on
liquid nitrogen so yeah this is this is
a nice PCB it's it's a solid VRM you
know it's it's not massive overkill well
for me maybe for stock air cooling in
h2o you could say yeah it's pretty
overkill for those but I wouldn't really
consider this massive overkill we we get
into massive overkill territory when
we're talking about well say the FT w3
right that has way too many bloody
phases this is more like reasonable
amounts of overkill or what I would
consider a solid vrm because you do get
that really nice efficiency right there
at where it would normally run and then
sort of 300 amp range yeah you could
probably do better if you had a couple
more phases but uh you still wouldn't
really notice the difference very much
right like we're still talking
single-digit different single-digit
reductions in vrm heat output and that's
with going up to a card with an hole
extra you know four phases which is
basically a 50% larger vrm so because
this is an 8 so going to 12 yeah this is
a 50% increase in phase account and
you'd still not see much of a much of a
difference so this is a really really
solid V curve erm as just not you know
ridiculously so and above that we of
course find the memory of erm which is a
two-phase using yet more of the FTO on
earth is going on
give me a second there fix that so the
the two-phase memory vrm is of course
using yet more of the FDM of 31 70s so
this is massive overkill the memory of
erm you're looking at sort of current
outputs of say 20 amps and 40 amps which
is like like you shouldn't even hit 40
amps output at all but 20 amps you'd be
looking at about 2 months of heat for
wealth of 40 amps you'd be looking at
about 4 watts of heat using the FTMs 31
70s for the memory is massive overkill
there is absolute like the GDD r6 should
never pull so much like really should
never pull more than 20 more than 20
amps because this does have even less
memory chips than like a 20 atti
because this is on that 256 bit memory
bus instead of the 384 so that kind of
that that's kind of them so the memory
of erm you know absolutely great no
problems there the voltage controller is
yet another you p90 512 which is kind of
an odd decision because for example the
10 series those would all actually use
different voltage controllers for the
memory of URM because that's an 8 phase
voltage controller running in two phase
mode and that is really kind of silly to
do it's not you know like I get why that
like it does keep the Bill of Materials
simple and it may you know ultimately it
might not cost that much to just keep
this chip anyway but in the past they
would have actually opted for a
different chip like they'd have a you
p90 511 and then they have like AUP 1666
for the for the memory of erm but here
they're just like now whatever just run
the 8 phase for it and right run the 8
phase chip for the two phase memory of
erm so that's kind of an interesting
decision there that Nvidia went for and
then of course in typical RT X 20 series
fashion we have two current balancing
circuits these don't actually current
balance the phases the cart balancing
for the phases is of course done by this
lot of this chip right here that's its
job
no these extra circuits here are four
current balancing you're very like your
oddball
six pin here and this is actually just a
6 pin like the the this part of the
connector is just like a solid block of
plastic I really don't know why Nvidia
didn't leave that area open you know
because if you have one of those you
know if you have one of those 8 pins
that looks like you know if you have one
of those 8 pins that looks like this
where you have the you know the the ones
with the separate 8 pin part like the
plot of the two extra pins separate like
that and they add up like this well you
could own a lot of cards you could just
sort of take this part and if this
wasn't right here that could just sort
of sit you know rest there it's not
there's not anything here that it would
short-circuit out by being there you
know short out against by being there so
I really don't get why Nvidia decided to
block that off because honestly it just
makes as far as I'm concerned it just
makes a cable management potentially a
bit more messy and it doesn't really add
anything to the card right and initially
I was really confused why on earth they
didn't just use a straight up a pin
which I still think is just like why why
even bother with this like yeah I I
don't know I don't get why what this is
supposed to achieve it doesn't look good
like like nobody's gonna see this once
it's plugged in nobody like no idea
absolutely no idea I'd honestly argue
they could have just kept it as an 8 pin
and just made that 8 pin optional and
then just like because that's actually
supported by the PCIe standard that's
why the the extra part of an 8 pin like
there's no actual power like no real
power transfer like all the X's well all
the extra two pins on an 8 pin add is
this extra ground connector
they don't actually add an extra power
line right they add a ground connector
and they add a sense line and it's like
they could've and the whole idea behind
that is is that extra sense line tells
the connector that hey you're running in
8 pin mode not 6 pin mode so in theory
you can have an 8 pin which will work as
a 6 pin right that's that's why the spec
is done
the way it is like it's designed so that
yes you could plug in a 6 pin into an 8
pin the card can then identify that it
doesn't actually have an 8 pin plug it
in it's just on a 6 pin and but then it
can decide to run at like reduced power
limit or something right you could you
can do those kinds of things that's why
the freakin sense pins are built in but
now Nvidia is just like let's just put a
block of plastic
I don't know for such an expensive card
I feel like they could have you know use
that as an extra feature but hey then
again you could also just cram double 8
pins on just about everything with my
logic because it's like well if you
don't need the xray then you don't have
to plug it in and it's part of the
specification that you don't need to do
that it but I'd say it's like this is
weird
it just looks weird they should have
just used a normal 6 pin but anyway they
do have these current balancing circuits
and those don't current balance the vrm
no no no see that would be far too
useful now they current balance the
power the power connectors because
Nvidia with this basically power
connector system they'll have like a 75
watt power limit on the 6 pin they'll
have like a hundred and 50 watt power
limit on the 8 pin and they'll have
another 75 power 75 watt power limit on
the well actually that one on the 12
volt rail your so only supposed to go to
like 66 watts and so because of this and
the fact that Nvidia actually monitors
all three current inputs on their cards
with you know these shunts you can run
into funny situations where say you set
your you know you set your power limit
on the card to and I'm just for
convenience sake gonna set that to 75
Watts I'm too lazy to deal with that
let's say you set the power limit to 300
Watts right so the whole card is allowed
to run a whole 300 Watts well you can
run into a situation where you're gonna
be pushing say on this right you're
gonna be pushing 50 watts into that and
then you're gonna be pulling 150 on the
8 pin and you're gonna be pulling 50 on
the on the PCIe slot and the thing is
yeah you're not hitting the 300 watt
limit but you are hitting the limit for
this power connector right here so the
card starts to throttle because that's
what you want with your card to do
so in videos solution to this problem
that they created because an AMD cards
can't actually do this they they don't
know where the power comes from like if
you wanted to well you could do some
very odd things to AMD cards with and in
terms of their power systems like
there's our x5 ATS that have a six pin
that literally isn't detected at all
like you don't have to plug it in
because it's just in parallel with the
existing eight pin so that leads to some
funny situations like if you plug in an
eight pin and or you plug in an eight
pin anis expand the card actually
doesn't see a difference because the six
pins just kind of there it's no I
actually properly hooked up and so those
cards don't care where the power comes
from they're just gonna grab it and use
it but in video cards because of all the
lovely power monitoring they're they're
gonna complain if you start overloading
one of their power inputs so you need
these power balancing circuits to
basically you know it's like say say
this fate like this would be hooked up
to say this phase and this phase is
pushing say 20 Watts right and normally
this phase would be on that overload at
eight pin well it decides that okay so
this this is overloaded so the power
balancing circuitry routes it to the six
pin and that frees up the 8 pin and the
6 pin goes up to 70 watts output instead
of just 50 right and this goes back down
to like 130 and then you're back you
just backed off the power limit and the
throttling stops so that's why NVIDIA
has this power balancing circuitry which
I quite frankly feel like you know it
would have just been easier if you eased
up on the power limits you know you
could have just done that that would
have done this that would have achieved
it a similar effect though admittedly
some power supplies might not like that
a lot but quite frankly it's just
nobody's like nobody in nobody except
well there's only two companies that
make GPUs so that's kind of hard to
argue about but generally speaking in
the past even Nvidia didn't bother with
this so I don't see why they're
bothering now and part and the things
making up the sort of power management
system on this card are of course the
two you p75 know seven six five one cues
which control the power balancing
circuitry and then for current
monitoring we have these two chips right
here which are NCP forty five four nine
ones and those are used across all
Nvidia of twenty series cards so far
both these and these so that's how in
video sort of has their their power
management like those are the chips
taking care of the power management the
NCP's monitor the various shunts around
the card like these guys also this right
here should be a shunt resistor that
right there should be a shunt resistor
we can also see some little MOSFETs
right here so those would be used for
power balancing as well then we can have
where else do we have it there's more of
them around the card it's kind of hard
to keep track of like oh yeah there's
one up here we have some more random
little MOSFETs you know so basically
Nvidia adds a whole bunch of circuitry
to their cards to better manage the the
power the input power can set like the
where the power is coming from into them
to be to reduce the amount of power
throttling the cards do because of
Nvidia's or very low power limits so
yeah but I mean hey nice way of solving
a problem you created I mean you know
instead of just setting the power limit
to something reasonable or you know just
ignoring the fact that you're
overloading one of the inputs it's not
like it's not like pushing 200 watts
through an 8-pin is actually going to
cause a problem because if that did
cause a problem vega's would be setting
people's people's systems on fire which
they don't do so also skylake chips
would be doing that at like sky like X
CPUs would also be doing that and
actually a lot of like past GPUs as well
but yeah so that is it for the RT x 2080
solid enough PCB you know has has the
usual
20 series NVIDIA sort of features 70
amps smart power stages a whole bunch of
card balancing and power monitoring
circuitry that quite frankly I think is
unnecessary very solid you know
you have an extremely overkill memory
vrm and a solid vcore vrm to go with it
and yeah there's not really much else to
it there's that's it that's that's the
RT X 2080 founders Edition PCB it's uh
it's solid enough you know there's
definitely more more powerful PCBs out
there I really don't think you'll notice
a difference if you actually go to those
though those cards may ship with much
much higher power limits and quite
frankly you know the sort of the leading
so far the leading in like the leading
features for RTX 2004 clocking or
basically having a very high power limit
having a really big cooling system or a
good cooling system generally speaking
with heat sinks the bigger it is the
better it is at dissipating heat so big
and good kind of go hand-in-hand in that
sense but you can also design big things
that suck at cooling that's just like
but if you know what you're doing then
you know if you make it just bigger than
generally it'll also be better if you
don't ridiculously screw up the design
in the process so now it that is it for
the video so thank you for watching like

below if you'd like to support gamers
Nexus there is a store gamers Nexus
dotnet where you can pick up things like
the gamers Nexus mod pack which you can
see in the background of the video and
also there's the gamers Nexus patreon if
you'd like to you know support gamers
Nexus through that and I run a channel
called actually hardcore overclocking
which is why I introduced myself as
build Zoid from actually hardcore
overclocking where I do a whole bunch of
other overclocking related content like
more PCB breakdowns and as well as sort
of other stuff that's overclocking
related it's kind of hard to describe so
that is it for the video thank you for
watching and good bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
