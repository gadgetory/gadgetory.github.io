we're looking at an external graphics
enclosure there's a couple of these this
year but the reason I'm highlighting
this one is because we actually showed a
Silverstone external GPU enclosure a
couple years ago at CES and is back so
before getting to that all this content
from today is brought to you by
Roseville and their new Cullinan case
you can read more about that on our site
so this thing this time it's a
partnership with gigabyte last time it
was Asus the one with the Asus never
made it to market and that was due to
what we sort of hypothesized we're
licensing issues with Thunderbolt but
that's no longer an issue Intel's on
board everyone's on board with the
protocol for these external graphics and
closures so this one with Silverstone
and gigabyte is basically you'd buy the
box so you get the alloy enclosure it's
all aluminum the bottom is actually
empty so it's drilled out in the bottom
and the other included item is the power
supply so you get a 450 watt 80 plus
bronze power supply because this is an
on market yet but it will be soon it
will actually make it this time if we
open it up here which is just done by a
simple push button
open up the top there's the back of the
power supply of course the on/off toggle
the two expansion slots for your video
cards are one GPU but two expansion
slots so those will fit most cards on
the market other than some of the mass
of 1080s we've seen recently and then
two thunderbolt ports in the back as
well so that's basically all there is in
terms of the actual serious support here
and then if we pull off the front panel
which is done by pushing that button and
just pulling on the panel get rid of
that you see the inside
there's the power supply and all the
cabling is it's not modular because why
would it be modular in this and that
connects of course to the video card
there's a PCB in the back in the bottom
it's empty but there's no real airflow
in the bottom that's fine because
there's a side fan it's a 120 millimeter
side intake fan pulls in that way
basically goes straight into the video
card whether it's a blower fan or a push
fan setup and then your power supply
also has the fan as expected and that
just works as normally it pulls the air
in this way and it pushes it out of the
top so that's pretty much the whole in
terms of thermals and support this does
not yet have a name
the price is sort of TBB d the estimate
is $350 but it's not finally it could
change it basically it's going up
against things like the razor core the
devil back box things like that but this
one is with gigabyte and silverstone so
that's all for this check links in the
description below for more information
and other Computex coverage thanks for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
