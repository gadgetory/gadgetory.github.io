collected for our recent reviews of
cases CPUs and video cards and then
build our annual buyers guides around
those tests those are published on the
website for Black Friday and Cyber
Monday and the second guide for this
year is today's gns choice of best AIB
partner video cards under two hundred
dollars and it's a sort of roundup in
that regard the first guide was the top
1440p monitors we've used this year if
you're curious for more but before we
get into that this content is brought to
you by the rosewill cullinan tempered
glass case which will soon be available
for 120 dollars the free 700 watt
balance power supply keep an eye out for
that sale on november 21st on amazon
follow the link below for more I've also
got links at below for all of the video
cards in this gns choice video this
content draws a clear line between the
price points for each major GPU that
exists in the sub two hundred dollar
market so we looked around for cards
that are at or below MSRP which is rare
this generation of GPS from both have
the end Nvidia as many of you know and
have pointed out and thankfully some of
the prices are finally starting to fall
in the latter half of the year so this
is a quick reference guide for the low
end you'll get the most depth with all
the caveats and all that stuff in our
major device reviews the standalone
reviews but hopefully this helps create
a sort of cheat sheet for sales coming
up for Black Friday Cyber Monday things
like that will resurrect some of our
benchmarks from this year to help with
that as well and keep in mind price is
mentioned here we're at time of filming
so if you click the links below you'll
go to the card the price may have
changed but that's the best we got for
you here's our table we put together on
the website yesterday these are devices
which perform to our standards for the
GPUs on the device and also the cards
that are listed here have you priced
lower than the competition or at least
at MSRP we're starting with the msi gtx
1063 gigabyte OC card which happens to
currently have a fifteen dollar mir
mail-in rebate and it's priced at the
MSRP of 200 before mir the card uses
dual axial fans for its cooling solution
with the usual assortment of heat pipes
and fins to do the rest and to be fair
mail-in rebates are normally a huge pain
and often have contingencies but it's
worth a shot as long as you're mentally
paired end up spending 200 instead of
185 for those of you in other countries
as long as the GTX 1063 gigabyte is
close in price to the RX 484 gigabyte
card all this content will remain
relevant and if it's more expensive by
more than a couple bucks the deal
worsens obviously the GTX 1063 gigabyte
generally outperformed and these are X
480 for gigabyte in our testing as seen
on these charts from our 1063 gigabytes
versus our X 480 for gigabyte benchmarks
note though that our tests were with an
EVGA 1063 gigabyte at reference clocks
or 1708 megahertz boost whereas the MSI
OC version is cheaper and has a clock
rate that's 51 megahertz higher in that
zone would recommend in here and GTA 5
as tested back in October for that
benchmark we saw the GTX 1063 gigabyte
performing better than the RX 44
gigabyte and averages and lows generally
running a few FPS faster in averages
gears for was an interesting test as
well we saw better averages on the 1063
gigabyte with better frame times on the
RX 44 gigabyte in this chart but that is
almost entirely because gears for is
inconsistent and its frame time delivery
on all devices really and just in case
you're curious the 1063 gigabyte an RX
44 gigabyte are both capable of 1440p
gaming at sort of easier settings
depending on the game they're not really
targeted at it but if you wanted to you
could upscale in for instance GTA 5
which would run out about 60 FPS average
on both devices with faster lows on the
1063 gigabyte but we already have a full
video and article specifically on the
1063 vs RX 484 gigabyte cards you can
check that out for the full depth as
always but for now we're recommending
the msi 1063 gigabyte card with its 185
post mir price as of today but that may
go up to 200 and if it does then look
into our alternative choice which is the
RX 484 gigabyte card that we've got
shown here and that is currently
shipping as a bonus with civilization 6
and that's on a couple AMD devices so if
that's on your holiday buying list then
basically you're saving 60 bucks if
you're not buying it anyway it's not
really doing anything for you so don't
don't dig into that hype to that
marketing too much but
you want it and you save some money so
that is a worthwhile consideration and
gives 1060 some competition in a
different way which is a free game code
if you check newegg there's technically
an RX 484 gigabyte card from power color
for 190 dollars but the heat sink design
sort of turned us off the cooling will
be a problem for single fan pcs coolers
with this particular device and that's
important for sustaining clock rates
instead we'd recommend either the
gigabyte g1 gaming our X 480 for 220
dollars with a twenty-dollar rebate so
that brings it down to 200 or the power
color red dragon for two hundred dollars
without any rebates it's just 200 flat
and both use axial fans for cooling two
of them gigabytes g1 gaming is pre
overclocked though to 1290 megahertz
while the PCs card runs stock at 1266
and that's boost the difference will be
a few percentage points in FPS that you
can fairly easily apply an OC through
wat man if desired we don't recommend
the g1 gaming unless you're getting the
rebate as that price is encroaching on
RS 488 gigabyte territory and the 8
gigabytes for 80 or 1066 gigabyte would
make more sense once you're north of two
hundred twenty dollars anyway in our
original content we encouraged looking
into the higher vram alternatives to
these those would be in the 240 to 250
dollar range wow the one advantage of
the two-hundred-dollar cards as we noted
in those original reviews is that if you
are in a unique price situation where an
extra forty or fifty dollars is the
difference between a better cpu or
adding an SSD vs not having one then it
might be worth saving the fifty bucks
from the video card budget and putting
it towards one of those upgrades next
card power colors are X for 70 red devil
is one of the best buys in this list
perhaps tied with MS is at 1063 gigabyte
at 185 the RX 470 red devil is currently
170 after mir though the price did just
increase and it's sort of frustrating
the price was 160 dollars after rebate
yesterday when I wrote the article and
posted it but the base price not the
rebate price changed the base price
changed and increased to a hundred and
eighty five dollars now so that brings
down with rebate to 170 rather than the
160 originally so it was at 170 which is
actually the new
srp for the RX 470 it's a decent price
considering the original launch prices
of about two hundred dollars despite a
180 listing price but still the card is
cheaper than its competition it's a
decent card and we would recommend it
but hopefully the prices drop again as
we approach Black Friday just to give an
idea of where the RX 470 stacks up
against nearby competition here's a look
at our metro last light chart from the
GTX 1050 review so that is important
because it means it's using pretty
recent drivers for both devices the RX
470 performs at 70 FPS average in this
particular game a good deal ahead of the
1050 TI and the RX 470 also runs
battlefield one brand new game with the
x11 at 1080p Ultra settings with an FPSO
about 75 average with a 1050 TI gaming
ex the more expensive msi card at 160
165 dollars is 58 FPS average that's a
big difference considering the gaming x
version is one of the cards for the 1050
islets price similar to an RX 470 the
470 makes a lot more sense to buy in our
review of the gtx 750ti we recommended
the RX 470 over the 1050 TI generally
but the gtx 1050 over the RX 460 so
there's been a bit of swapping between
Nvidia and AMD here we also noted one
important point for the gtx 750ti if you
can find them for MSRP at one hundred
forty dollars not the 160 dollar price
range of a lot of the aib partner models
they make sense for folks who would
otherwise not be able to afford an i5
cpu so for example if an RX 470 eats
into cpu budget and forces something
like an i3 then the thirty dollar
savings from a gtx 1050 TI can be put
toward better components same argument
we made for the 200 verse 2 50 out of
cards aside from this use case the 1050
TI is surrounded by two cards that
handle its flanks well so that does make
it a bit awkward recommend sometimes and
our gns choice article on the website
lists the msi 1050 ti OC as an honorable
mention that's 140 dollar model with one
fan and it's shown on the screen now but
still if you can grab an RX for 74
gigabyte for 170 to 180 which is the new
MSRP sapphires got a few power colors
got a few
XFX as a few then we'd strongly consider
those instead finally for the low end
we're recommending the g x 1050 over the
RX 460 the 1050 outperforms the 460
considerably in a few of the games we
tested and at least by some margin in
every game we tested it's just a better
performer now the 460 did have a price
drop of ten dollars to $100 MSRP
technically there's a few that are
online for about ninety six but at 110
the gtx 950 does make better sense at
the low end in the same way that the RX
470 makes more sense at its price point
that a 1050 TI partner model at 165 or
whatever it is zotac gtx 1050 mini is
one of the smallest cards on the market
right now and marks itself the top of
our list for SF fitx for htpc boxes we
found the GTX 1050 to be perfect for
lower intensity games like overwatch
dota 2 csgo and rocket league and just
as a mini sampling of our original test
which you can find on the channel of the
website the performance for overwatch on
a GTX 1050 was about 92 FPS average with
ultra settings at 1080p dota 2 operated
about 148 FPS average though had a wide
frame time range across all tested
devices and the GTX 1050 even handles
GTA 5 with very high and ultra settings
at about 57 FPS average pretty
remarkable for this price range if you
wanted mods though you'd probably want
to go with the four gigabyte 1050 TI or
something better like the 470 because
once you start adding those the two
gigabyte 1050 will begin to struggle a
bit so that's it for this buyer's guide
will be doing a few more of these two
wrap the year but basically digging back
through all of the data from components
tested this year all the cases and
coolers and SSDs things that have gone
through the lab either saw publication a
while ago or never made its publication
we're revisiting all that compiling it
into these roundups and hopefully help
some folks out make some decisions for
the holiday season so as always patreon
link in the post roll video to help us
out directly we have a couple more of
these coming up so subscribe for more
and then we'll be getting back to the
tactical content with EVGA SVR em stuff
pretty soon it's already on the bench
and was just burning up this room right
before filming subscribe for more
