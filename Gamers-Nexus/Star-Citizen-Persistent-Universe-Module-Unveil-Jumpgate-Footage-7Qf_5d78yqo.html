dotnet and i'm joined by chris Roberts
hey one-eye day we just we just watched
an unveil or some more information just
a more information about what we're
going to do in the petition universe
side of minutes it's early we originally
I mean basically we're going to do a
proper event inside by Southwest but we
thought it would be a nice opportunity
to come here to pack south and sort of
do a very early like behind-the-scenes
peek at some of the stuff we're working
on just because we want to do a lot of
sort of community you know in back of
focused events right so that's that's
pretty important for us so what are some
of your bigger items that were discussed
today what are the things I really get
you excited well I mean I the one that I
really like is sort of the jump point
the wormhole stuff which is we've sort
of been working on it for a while we've
got a visualization that we showed that
I think people liked but it's really
just it's a great dynamic for like how
you navigate it and fly around now it's
sort of and we're basically have a whole
sort of procedural system where you know
the various different sort of obstacles
you've got to fly around to traverse
this wormhole come in sir so that's
probably the element that I like the
most I mean a lot of the stuff that we
showed you know there's still a lot of
par should be done on it i mean i'm
looking forward to having the whole sort
of art corp environment you can walk
around in a couple of months for
everyone out there to play and also
internally for us to use so i mean
there's a lot of the foundation of all
the stuff that's happening in persistent
universe is going in now and it's kind
of one of those things that at the
beginning you've got to put a lot of
foundational stuff in so you don't
necessarily have much visual advancement
as you are but i feel really good
because there's a lot of like backend
stuff that's that's anyways it's gonna
it's all going to work well is you know
we don't have there's not any point in
terms of Alma that anyone's going I
don't know how we're going to do that so
like we know exactly what the plan is
for all the stuff it's just a matter of
executing in so that's actually quite a
nice place to do so a lot of execution
it's going to take a long time it's not
going to happen in a week or you know
even this year but generally
you know to be to that to be there well
you know how we going to have all the
backend work and all that so we've we've
basically figured all that part out and
we're sort of now in the implementation
process and so we're showing some early
stages of what can happen the position
Universal when it all happens properly I
think it's going to be pretty amazing
and for those who will be watching the
presentation once it's all online what's
can you put sort of the the timeline
into perspective well so I mean like so
we're going to Deb you like the FPS
modules beginning me first which is
basically first post and compound we
weren't showing that today but that's
going to be really cool and then not too
soon at not too far afterwards is going
to be the planetside module which
basically means that in your hangar you
can now step outside the doors of the
hangar and go around the right for in
this case art corp which we know
there'll be various locations shops
files to go and visit you also invite
some of the friends come join you in the
hangar so that's that's all going to
happen sort of end of March beginning of
April then sort of a little later on the
year say I don't know when it would be
say June and July we'd have another drop
of the persistent module where you
basically can now take off you can buy
and sell some stuff and you can also
take off from the planet and go to
another planet and then at the end of
the year we'll sort of transition to
having you know we'll aim we're shooting
for five systems that you can travel
between right now I don't know whether
we'll manage get them all weather will
have more of them some debate it sort of
depends on house how quickly we can put
stuff together with the modular system
we're building but that's sort of the
persistent universe sort of timeline so
by the end of the year that should be
basic your ability to sort of go between
locations buy and sell some stuff get
missions and do that on a sort of more
rudimentary level and then over the
following year it's all good it's going
to have a lot more the content added a
lot more so the finesse and the
additional sort of functionality and
systems at it so that's a quick recap of
what we saw here we will have more
coverage online as embargoes left there
is a full article written linked in the
description below if you're interested
in that we thank you as always real life
no more than welcome happy to give you
more time yeah and we will see you all
next time alright see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
