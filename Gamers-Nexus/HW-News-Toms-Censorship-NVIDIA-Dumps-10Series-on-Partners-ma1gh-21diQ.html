hardware news recap nothing happened in
the past week other than the first GPU
architecture announcement in about two
or three years so we've got Turing to
talk about again already went through
most of that of course the board
partners and their absorption of left
over ten series cards is pretty big
topic right now there's also the new
leak that Intel for the thousandth time
might or probably will be soldering
their new CPU is the ninth
well the 9000 series CP is if you can't
call them a generation and then also
Intel backpedaling on it's no benchmark
rule that they added to the end-user
License Agreement for their micro code
update before that this video is brought
to you by the Thermaltake level 20 VT
micro ATX case the level 20 VT takes the
high quality at level 20 design and
makes it more affordable and shrinks it
down to a micro ATX form factor at that
with fully modular paneling it's
possible to rearrange this case into
whatever configuration you prefer for a
micro ATX case that can be a discussion
piece in a home theater system click the
link in the description below
quick GN news before getting into the
rest of the industry news coming back
from Germany we were able to finish up
most of our office so the set is now
more or less complete as you can see we
have a few more things to tweak but it's
gotten there it's pretty much done at
this point and the audio is sounding
pretty good in this room now so that was
pretty big for us and then we also just
restocked this shirt so the full GN logo
design front and back design it's the
original gamers Nexus shirt that we made
years ago the first one first design we
had that's been fully restocked in both
cotton and tri-blend and we also have
our two-tone Raglan hoodies still
available in most sizes if you want a
lightweight zipper hoody for a cooler
weather that's coming around the corner
pretty soon for most of you so let's get
into the news for the first one this
news item is a follow-up to the Tom's
Hardware r-tx discussion several former
Tom's Hardware senior editors have
reached out to gamers Nexus to discuss
concerns pertaining to the Tom's
Hardware us divisions handling of the
situation in one such instance Igor
Wallace ech former senior contributing
editor of Tom's hardware
notified us that he purchased an
independent license for the
german-speaking area and foley
independently operates Tom's Hardware
Germany or Toms Harbor de Malo SEC has
done excellent work on GPU testing in
the past and now runs Tom's de with full
independence from the US office he also
posted a forum response in the Tom's
Hardware us thread about avram pillages
flawed article that we recently ranted
about in his post igor said quote for me
this article is damaging to my business
because it all so seriously destroys the
name and reputation that all reviewers
have built up over a long time period
including my reputation not everybody
knows that I'm independent from the US
does anyone wonder why there were no
reviews of the latest AMD Vega cards on
Tom's Harbor us the argument is lack of
necessary budget I tested it all wrote
in-depth reviews about the cards but
nothing was moved over and that's from
the Tom's Germany to the Tom's us site
egor was issued a 100 year ban for his
post and his posting was deleted
although quoted segments are still
visible in the threat others former
senior editors have also voiced concerns
about the just buy it article as it was
titled and some of them have faced
similar actions to igor's ban and post
the leadings this is all following a
purchase of Tom's Hardware the US branch
will move to future publishing from
perch soon perch presently owns an
attack as well and the current
editor-in-chief averin pilch of Tom's
Harbor us the author of the just by RT X
article is up for renewal or termination
as his contract is an impermanent one so
we'll see a lot of shifting around at
Tom's for the time being at least but in
the very least who wanted to let you
know that Igor is running that Tom's
Hardware de or Tom's Hardware Germany
independently from the US branch and is
still doing the full in-depth testing
over there that he's always done for the
old version of Tom's us board partners
potentially getting stuck with 10 Series
GPUs from Nvidia leading into the twenty
series launched with r-tx cards so in a
new report from digit times the
Taiwanese semiconductor market experts
analyzed Nvidia's quarter two revenue
earnings which they claim are backed by
massive contracted GPS shipments to
board partners interest
the report claims that quote more than
10 graphics card makers have no choice
but to swallow contracted shipments
released by Nvidia to deplete its
inventories and chiefly listed here Asus
MSI and gigabyte are among those who are
suspected to be absorbing all that 10
series inventory and videos likely left
with a large surplus of the 10 series GP
is from the cryptocurrency mining bubble
burst and digitized report seems to
suggest that Nvidia is stronger than
expected quarter to earnings are
resultant of forcing AIB partners to
absorb the leftover inventory
additionally the report claims that AIB
partners had to absorb contracted
shipments quote in order to secure that
they can be among the first batch of
customers to get sufficient supply
quotas of new generation of GPUs that be
turing at this point and we think that
this is partly why Nvidia's prices for
the twenty series might be a bit higher
than what the market expected it would
have to bear so this will allow the ten
series to continue shipping alongside
the twenty series cards without either
them encroaching on the other space the
1080i and the twenty-eight eti can exist
simultaneously in occupy actually very
different market spaces further the
naming r-tx would also allow for gtx to
continue to exist in the very least for
now as the 10 series 1080i 1080 and so
forth clears its inventory so for now
the pricing situation does seem like it
allows for the 10 series to continue to
exist as a favorable option and clear
out all that inventory I mean at the end
of the day Nvidia makes both 10 and 20
Series GPUs so to some extent what do
they care RTX branding will allow the
two markets to exist somewhat
simultaneously and we're also kind of
I'll go ahead and speculate this right
now this isn't really confirmed in any
way just speculating here but we've been
talking about the idea that the GTX of
branding might come back even in the 20
series perhaps for something more like a
20 60 or 20 50 or something that even
with Turing architecture it just
wouldn't have enough processing power to
do any real-time ray tracing in any
meaningful way so might not get the r-tx
branding might stick
with GTX and may even be something like
a rebranded Pascal GPU so Jeff
speculation not confirmed or not even a
rumor just something we've been thinking
about and speaking of that the landmark
news announcement for the past week was
the twenty atti twenty eighty and twenty
seventy announcement we have several
pieces covering this in great depth so
if you really want the DS he'll go back
and watch those but to quickly recap it
for you
and videos marketing focus here is on
real-time ray tracing RT x indicates
that RT x doesn't just mean ray tracing
it's a whole suite of tools that nvidia
is pushing out via its usual sdk channel
so it does more than just ray tracing
but that is the focal point and then GD
d are six memory is the biggest change
here in that the memory subsystem is now
shifting over from g5 and g 5x 2 GD d r6
and also h PM to not making an
appearance in any of the immediately
discussed cards and again we have a lot
more detail in our launch coverage if
you want more information on these
products next up is a rumor so leaked
slides indicate solder for the ninth gen
or 9000 series or whatever we end up
calling it once it launches the new
Intel KS q CPUs so an alleged leak
indicates that Intel is using stem or
solder thermal interface material on the
looming ninth generation or 9000 series
coffee like refresh 10 M up in the air
what we're calling it because it's going
to be 9000 series but it's still coffee
Lake so is it really a generation at
that point I think is the question the
solder dye chest will be limited to the
case cube parts as far as the rumors and
leaks indicate today and if the
information is to be believed this is at
least the second a somewhat substantial
rumor that we've seen regarding Intel
using a soldered IHS for this series of
CPUs so it's still up in the air whether
or not Intel will actually do this they
are rumors but there are a couple of
rumors now confirming the same thing so
hopefully it happens because a soldered
IHS while it might be bad for business
for liquid metal makers or something
would be better overall for the product
and if it helps Intel compete with AMD
and hopefully that's what they're
looking at at this point cuz AMD is real
competition now can't just play around
anymore
then hopefully they'll do it so anyway
that's the rumor really hoping it
happens
Intel backpedaling on its no benchmark
you will a rule so this while we were
flying back from Gamescom we encountered
this interesting controversy that Intel
found itself in the center of and the
controversy was with a micro code update
a blog post by Bruce parens originally
discovered that the micro code updates
EULA makes a very very specific
statement against publishing benchmarks
and the statement said you will not and
will not allow any third party to
truncate a bit here use the software on
your products other than those included
in the Intel hardware products or
software identified in the software or
publish or provide any software
benchmark or comparison test results so
upon seeing this we emailed Intel and
asked what the heck what's your
statement on this this is weird and they
said we are updating the license now to
address this and we'll have a new
version available soon as an active
member of the open-source community we
continue to welcome all feedback and
that comes from Intel to gamers next
it's not sure if they shared that with
anyone else but that's what they sent us
and then as of filming today anyway this
was a bit old by the time you see this
the license has completely been updated
to remove you know benchmark clause in
its entirety and the only thing we're
left with is whether or not that affects
all versions of the license or if it's
just kind of the public license does it
also affect enterprise server data
center type users but either way they've
removed that no benchmark clause that
gave people pause and made everyone a
bit concerned about what Intel was
trying to do next up a Logitech G pro
Wireless Gaming Mouse Logitech has
announced their newest wireless gaming
mouse aimed specifically at eSports
players eSports players historically
refrain from using wireless peripherals
as they often assert that such devices
come at the cost of weight input lag and
response time Logitech though has long
labored to change that misapprehension
and the Logitech G pro wireless gaming
mouse is their latest testament to what
they think is a wireless eSports ready
gaming device the Logitech G Pro
Wireless is an ambidextrous Mouse with
removable
left and right side buttons and uses a
lot of text latest iteration of their
hero sensor capable of up to 16,000 dpi
and 400 IPS we talk about most of stuff
in the past so if you've seen our
coverage of Logitech's wireless mice
it's been a little while now we don't
eat too much of it anymore
but the g9 auditor was the last big one
we did if you've seen that same overall
technology inside of it the wireless
functionality works just fine it is in
fact faster in terms of input latency
and responsiveness than a lot of the
wired mice even so that that kind of
becomes a bit of a misconception that
Wireless is slower especially when
you're talking about 100-150 plus dollar
mouse Dell announced to gaming displays
adding to their Dell gaming line of
monitors both of Dells new displays are
based on TN panels overclockable up to
155 Hertz they offer AMD freesync and a
one millisecond response time the
biggest differentiators are panel size
and resolution the s 2 4 1 9 HGF yeah
the names are still monitored names it's
a 24 inch monitor running 1080
resolution while the S 2 7 1 9 DGF
offers a 27-inch screen running 2560 by
1440 for the resolution 24 inch model
beat 320 bucks while the larger 27 inch
variant will be 550 availability begins
end of month August 28th or so so a bit
on the high end especially for the
resolution but they might offer features
you want and can't get otherwise Corsair
teasing the hydro ax series of coarser
has been somewhat over in declaring
their custom liquid cooling ambitions
from TV and rebranded aqua computer
fittings and accessories at Computex
last year to take you on a former EK WV
CEO and CTO mark tank oh and Nico tivat
our earlier this year it would seem for
all the time in trouble that course here
finally has some form of DIY enthusiast
liquid cooling to bring to market as
their website indicates that the hydro X
series launch is imminent the teaser
shows what appears to be rigid pet G
tubing in an X formation filled with
purple coolant and the captions just add
water and coming soon so I guess it's
finally happening for Corsair hopefully
we'll look at these we might have a
liquid cooling and open-loop
I'm set up by the time we come out
finally hardware sales clearly the GTX
10 series quite a steal right now how
compared to the last few months and
that's with the launch of the RT X card
so finally end videos 10 series has some
competition it just happens to be Nvidia
made the competition so 1080i and 1080p
repeatedly over the last few weeks as
partners have been forced to absorb the
inventory vaguer cards just to be clear
here with the joke Vega 56 was a really
good car beat we really enjoyed that car
a lot of fun to work with lots of fun to
overclock it's easier to modify them 10
G's cards are pretty locked down but it
hasn't gone on sale in any meaningful
way yet we've kept an eye on it because
when we worked on Vega the 56 was a card
that we actually really liked it was it
was just fun to work with and that's
because it was so easily modified but
alas pricing has not been the best so
we're keeping an eye on it for you if it
ever does end up dropping
either way though 1080i 1080s are on
sale we'll link one of them below that's
a better price than some of the others
if you carry or if you want to pick one
out
team t4 is Vulcan 16 gigabytes of RAM
ddr4 3000 megahertz is also available at
one of the better deals for RAM lately
given Ram prices and then also there's a
Samsung 28 inch 4k monitor that's
available on Amazon will link that below
too because it's been marked down a bit
so that's it for this week as always go
to store documents nexus net to pick up
one of our products if you want one of
our shirts the mod matt is back on
backorder it sold out again so if you
want to pick one up we already have the
new round in production will be here
soon enough and you just place your
backorder on store documents next to
sign up to make sure you get one when
the next batch comes in otherwise the
beer glasses are on the store as well
and in Stockton shipping thank you for
