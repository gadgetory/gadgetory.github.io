comparison between the gtx 1060 founders
edition card and so the previous
founders edition cards the 1070 is one
of them that we show we also show the RX
480 and then we've got this that I'll
throw in there as well that's the msi
gtx 960 gaming ex before we get into
that this content is brought to you by
msi and their new x99 a gaming
motherboards including the gaming pro
carbon and titanium which are built for
Broadwell ii so we did one of these
videos with the RX 480 or we're
basically showing we've got objective
benchmarks we already published the
decibel numbers that show how these
things perform in comparison to each
other when these cards like the Twin
Frozr cards spin down to zero rpm
because they're under no-load the noise
floor kind of shows itself and that is
in the form of this power supply fan and
this very slow and quiet but still
audible CPU cooler fan so those are the
two things in the system producing noise
we disconnect all of these bench fans
during noise testing the noise testing
itself does not occur right here where
we're standing right now it's slightly
different we have a very fixed
environment to do the noise testing the
DB meter is always positioned 20 inches
away from the face of the card and the
same will be true for this where we're
going to show you what it sounds like
with the fan at zero rpm of course it's
going to sound like nothing Auto 50% and
100% for the fan speeds and we'll also
be recording that noise using our zoom
h6 n recorder that we use for all of our
audio for video production and then we
mount an XY mic to that we position at
20 inches away keep the same spot keep
it at it's maxed out input volume and
then you'll basically be able to hear a
subjective difference between the cards
to put the decibels into more
perspective now before that for the
objective difference we've got a decibel
chart that we've put on the screen now
this was discussed in the review but the
short of it is that the passively cooled
cards revealed a noise floor about 30
7.1 DB and again that's the PSU and the
CPU fan once the GPU has some load
applied for MSI the required amount is
about 60 degrees Celsius of load the
fans spin up and produce some noise and
auto plants the
the configuration with the EFI card at
37.5 DB and again this is total system
noise not per card noise we've got the
whole system here and that's as opposed
to the ten eighty and ten seventy s
which are at 47 DB 50% fan speed has us
at around thirty eight decibels versus
41.9 for the 1080 and ten seventy and
100 percent speed is where the
difference really shows with a 1080 Fe
nearly 10 DB louder than a ten 60 Fe and
we'll put that in perspective just with
relation to these charts 10 DB is
perceivable to the user as about a 2x
increase in volume so you can kind of
think of it that way because this is a
logarithmic so for example if you're
looking at 25 decibels versus 50 that is
not 2x it's actually much greater than
2x if you're looking at 40 to 50
decibels then we're talking about a 2x
increase in perceived noise levels from
the system so that's the the objective
analysis let's throw this card in
these need to die die die die they spun
their last spin I just gonna launch
precision if I can find it there's a fan
spinning right now have it a spin
okay so we're going to jump between a
couple of audio files of the different
cards playing back you'll see it
playback and we're going to be playing
them back to back with the again 50%
100% speeds and that will compare
between the 10 60 the RX 480 and the
1070 I might throw in one of these 1060
cards as well just to kind of give you
an idea of where those if they are more
or less the same as the 1060 F II just
with a 0 DB output when idle this is
where we go like that's right
these video card fans even though we
show 100% speed keep in mind that they
pretty much never actually hit 100% fan
speed unless in the instance of
something like in SFF case like the
origin Chronos we recently reviewed
which was pushing 100% fans because it
was going so hot in the thermals so the
fans tend to stay around 50% speed this
one will sit at just about 60% in an
open-air bench environment where it's
got reasonable cooling and that's
because as long as it can hit its
thermal threshold that it's happy with
which is below 71 Celsius we found in
our review then the fan won't speed up
because it just it doesn't see it as
necessary to produce more noise in favor
of thermals if the card only really
wants a 71 c or lower temperature so
that's that's one note the card here
this is the Twin Frozr version of the
1060 video card and these because of the
larger fans and the bigger heatsink will
stick at around 35% fan rpm in our
identical bench so instead of 60% is 35
but the fans are completely different
there's two of them they're bigger this
is a blower fan these are axial fans and
that's where you get the part of the
difference so stuff to know for
comparing noise of course if you have a
more powerful cooler you can run it with
lower fan RPMs in general that's where
the liquid comes into play will show
more of that later but the idea there is
that if you wanted to you could lower
the radiator fan rpm pretty low and
still have a lower temperature than
these we showed this in our rx 480 or
GTX 1071 of those two benchmarks will be
converted to a hybrid we showed it there
but yeah that's it for the subject of
noise comparison thank you for watching
