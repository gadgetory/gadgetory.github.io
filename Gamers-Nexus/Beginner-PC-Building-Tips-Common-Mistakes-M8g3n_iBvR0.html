dotnet and i'm joined by mike gag leon
and we're talking about some system
building tips today so tips and tricks
as you're building computers whether
you're intermediate or a newer builder
this should hopefully help out with some
of the frequently asked questions like
what is the the most recent case you are
working on most recently we built the
roswell b-2 spirit i love working on
those big cases there they're just so
much easier to get in and out of however
sometimes you can run into difficulty
with cable length especially for the cpu
power right normally you want to run it
from around the back of the motherboard
tray and then down and over but
sometimes if the cable is not long
enough you can run it up underneath the
graphics card and then directly into the
yeah rather than over everything oh yeah
exactly
and that cuts down on the profile the
cables and stuff and that's right and
kale management it is it is mostly an
aesthetic thing but on the functional
side there's not really that big of an
impact for cooling if you're to move the
CPU cable one place to the others are
going to change that much standalone but
it will change dust accumulation and
stuff like that because as you have more
cables it'll catch the dust most of the
time I like to go when I'm looking for a
case I like to look at all the pictures
and see what kind of cabling they have
built in or as a lot of times they'll
have some really neat you know channels
or ducts or or clips already built into
the case that make like cable management
a ton easier and they'll pre route a lot
of the cable yes yeah yeah and on the
dust side as well the orientation of
your case fans will impact how much dust
gets into the case so if you are
normally one would hope that if the
system is left in its stock
configuration the fans should be about
as good as they can be but if you're
buying new fans you kind of want to make
sure you're aiming at the right
direction yeah this is there's a few
ways to tell which way the fans point
like if you you're not sure which way
the intake is going
there's the markings on the side of the
fan right then then there's the the
brand sticker yeah which is normally on
the receiving end so whatever side the
stickers on that's the direction that
the air is going to be traveling yeah
it's got the little like you said the
little arrows on it too
yeah most people are like so make sure
you install this point in the correct
direction and on that front I guess in
in our thermal test we've learned things
like positioning the fans on the top of
the case for instance you normally have
two slots on the top right and in some
of my observational tests at least with
the NZXT cases if you route the or if
you put the fan on the top back it can
sometimes steal air in a way that's
undesirable from an air cooler on the
cpu so you'll just have to try that with
your different CPU coolers and see what
works best
that would probably my main piece of
advice is try it on the top back try it
on the top front and see with a 264 or
some other software what performs best
and then just change it because that
will benefit you in the long run for
sure other things we've talked about for
building what about things that are
commonly overlooked um a lot of people
don't think about the front panel
connectors or at least have questions of
whether of how to orient them another
thing when you're looking at your case
for the cable management stuff a lot of
cases will have the front panel
connectors routed in really conveniently
and they'll be coming out of the bottom
right where they get plugged in the
motherboard i really like that i also
like labeling i like to have the the
label of the cable facing out when i do
the front panel connectors yeah that
helps with making sure most a lot of the
cables doesn't matter how one goes on
which pin we're talking about the FPC
the front panel controller FPC and
that's your power LEDs your power button
power switch right reset switch and for
the most part doesn't matter but some of
the cables especially the ones that
you'll see with two different colored
wires are actually positive and negative
or ground in a positive something like
that
and those do matter they're normally
marked on the board negative will often
correlate with the black wire and if you
want to make it even easier just like
you're saying just point the text
outward right so that you can read it
and that means that it is installed in
the correct orientation right but of
course before you'll be doing any of
that you should be putting your
standoffs right yeah endear into your
case to make sure you're not shortened
anything yeah yeah that's overlooked a
lot I think that so a lot of modern
cases and I will pre install those right
which is amazing but but we both know we
get some cases and they're not always
installed and if you don't know what
they are you're looking at these brass
screws and you don't know where they go
right so you just directly screw in your
motherboard and you fry it yeah yeah if
you screw the motherboard and straight
to the case you're gonna be in the most
common scenario creating a direct short
because the case is often made out of
Steel even if it's painted it will still
create a direct short and that's by just
touching all the contact pins so
generally you will have a scenario where
just doesn't turn on and bad scenario is
you could actually short something to
damage it what you're saying but for the
most part if you are lucky you can just
put the standoffs in and try it again
and hope that it works this right but
generally just a direct short any other
tips we have and gentle another thing
when in reference to the motherboard is
Ram slotting oh yeah
every motherboards a little bit
different in the way that they whether
it's 2 4 or 1 3 if you're only using two
sticks of RAM you have to open up your
book and take a look don't forget to do
that because RTFM because then you'll
start your fear up or you'll try to and
it will not start yes is just as easy as
check the manual yeah always always
check the manual because they'll have
useful information about like which
screws are the stand off screws and
other kind of features that the case
might have that that set it apart from
anything you might have yeah or on the
motherboard side the motherboard manuals
include a lot of really important
information that is actually this is
something that we weren't talking about
before the shoot the PCIe slots for
multi-gpu configuration
if you have a board say that x99
classified EVGA board that's got maybe
five PCIe slots you can't just plug two
video cards into any of those slots it's
got to be correct per the motherboard
prescription to make sure that they're
getting the right amount of brains so
check the manual for that as well if
you're doing multi-gpu you need to make
sure if you're supposed to use slot 1
and 3 or 1 in 5 it's very rarely 1 &amp;amp; 2
to close not the same line count that's
something to check and then on the
motherboard manual side again the the
RAM slots and you'll often find extra
power headers on boards right
overclocking and thermal paste I don't
know about you but I'm a rice grain kind
of guy yeah I do not use the smearing
tools that come with thermal paste I
think that's crazy I never use credit
cards I just do your little rice grain
and I plop the CPU cooler right down on
top you use the little plastics note
never have never well yeah some of those
thermal paste tubes will come with a
plastic spoon or smoother or something
it's just a gimmick it don't don't use
it as someone who's pulled off and a lot
of CPU coolers it always spreads out
beautifully evenly without any
assistance so don't don't don't risk
getting pasted into your sick view or
around your to another board you don't
want to mess with yeah we have a whole
video on that and the channel just
search for the word thermal paste and
you'll find it on the channel and you
and then when you're torquing down your
cooler you want to make sure don't over
torque your screws anywhere on your
computer these screws do not need to be
gorilla tight I'd like to think of it as
monkey tight just go till they stop and
that should be plenty you're not having
tons of my bread you don't worry about
things falling out so yeah the CPU
cooler especially because if you over
torque the screws on that you can
actually bend the board or damage the
CPU yeah but that's what the recent sky
like CPU bending scandal I guess was
about sure a better thing so yeah that's
suddenly a big one what about the i/o
shield the i/o shield oh that's that's a
pet peeve of mine
I forget that almost every system build
I do because I'm so excited to get them
the board into the case and the CPU
mounted and the graphs carded and
everything plugged up that I forget to
put it should be the first thing you do
as soon as you open up your motherboard
you should take your i/o shield and put
it in the case because you will forget I
forget oh yeah I forget yeah and at this
point actually I don't even use that
which is probably not the best practice
but yeah it does it it doesn't make a
real difference in anything but as
somebody who's got a little bit of OCD
right I really like having all the parts
that it came with in the computer I have
a lot of extra parts around they give
you a lot of extra part yeah yeah so
that is it for our quick build tips
