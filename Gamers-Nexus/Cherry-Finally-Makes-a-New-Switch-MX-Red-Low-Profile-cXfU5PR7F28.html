lighting setup so I believe we now have
the best lighting out of everyone on
YouTube it's not only the partners you
launch products at CES but also their
suppliers in this case cherry has its
new MX low profile switch which is quite
a bit smaller than the MX normal
switches that you're used to cherry is
not replacing or getting rid of their
normal mx3 switches but they are adding
to them and attempting to sate some of
the demand for smaller keyboards with
lower profile keys primarily from
industry partners before that this video
is brought to you by EVGA and the x2 99
dark motherboard for the Intel high-end
desktop CPUs the x2 99 dark is one of
the only motherboards on the market with
proper vrm cooling we've tested this and
found a significant performance increase
over those without active cooling on the
brms this board was used in our recent
attempts to set a top-10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x-29 dark at the link in the description
below for now cherry only has a red
switch on demo they plan to add a cup of
the other standard switch types in the
future including the black and brown
switches with an option for blue the
switch types will remain the same so
with red you have a linear switch with
blue you have somewhat of a clicky
switch and so forth so those
denominations will remain the same
within the color categories of Cherry MX
switches the difference is really just
in the size the form factor which of
course brings with it some changes to
the inner workings
so Cherry's goal starting out with this
was to reduce size by 50 to 60 percent
of the switch which was partly demand
from their partners while still
retaining the Cherry feel for how it
actually actuates and how it feels when
you push the switch down they ended up
reducing it by about 35 percent in
reality and the difference there between
35 percent and 60 percent primarily
comes down to physics just apparently
not allowing them to get it any smaller
so we'll see if that changes in the
future but for now it was necessary to
keep it at least somewhat larger versus
the 50 to 60 percent reduction target if
only to retain the
the actual feeling that everyone's
gotten used to his cherry we haven't had
enough hands-on time yet to really judge
how close the new switches are to their
larger sized counterparts but cherry
does say that they pretty much feel the
same and they've done survey groups with
hundreds of people in them at this point
the main change on the switch is its
cylindrical housing now so underneath
the key cap you'll find a cylinder
rather than a square it still has the
plus sign for the centerpiece but the
cylinder part is supposed to help with
dust and water resistance cherry didn't
give us exact specifications yet but
from what we understand it should be
pretty close to ip68 which is a number
representing the dust and water
resistance the dust being the first
number zero to six and the second number
being the water resistance zero to eight
for the scale where higher is better
resistance so we don't have an exact
number but they did say it should be
towards the top end of the scale and
some of the higher end phones on the
market would be IP 68 or 67 to give you
a reference point so that cylindrical
top is supposed to help out there and
then if you look closer surrounding the
cylinder at the center in this case the
red or the blue one you'll also see
somewhat of a moat surrounding them
which can be used to place a light so
the diodes are still positioned
underneath the plus sign of the switch
or around the parameter of it but there
is a carved out moat surrounding the
center cylinder that you actually
depress when you press the button and
that's where the light comes throughh
cherry tells us that they were able to
do this without using a light pipe which
is an extra part and increases cost and
we're able to use normal diode so the
stem is surrounded by just sort of a
cutout area where the light can shine
through and that's as opposed to the
diodes that you see on for example the
Logitech Keyboard where you have lenses
that can focus the light or on previous
examples where there are light pipes one
of the final changes of note is the cut
out underneath the switch to accommodate
service mount devices this is useful for
OEMs and manufacturers who have requests
to shrink the size of their keyboard
while still fitting all the components
underneath if you're allowing clearance
underneath the switch housing to
accommodate SM T's
then obviously the whole point of
reducing the switch size has been kind
of moot so that's what we know for now
on the Cherry MX low-profile switches
and if you want more information keep an
eye out because we're waiting on
additional spec sheets from cherry on
the new switches and we don't have a
rollout time for the switch or for
manufactured products and don't know
who's going to be making them they're
not quite small enough to accommodate
for example a laptop excite except for
something like the Titan from MSI but
they will allow for smaller keyboards
which in speaking with cherry could be
useful for folks like their business and
enterprise clients we don't have an
exact date on when these switches will
become available or when partners in our
side of the industry will begin using
the products but as more it comes out
we'll let you know so as always
