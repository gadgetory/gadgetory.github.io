when 805 infinity at CES originally a
prototype concept for which in 'wind had
not yet even declared a price in fact
the end when team asked us to ask our
audience what they would pay for the
enclosure but wanted us to know that the
case may never even exist today we're
reviewing the in win 805 infinity
picking apart to all of its many flaws
and talking about its few well-designed
features because it does actually exist
now it's been made a real product this
case is the already existing in win 805
including the same tooling the only
difference is the infinity mirror effect
with RGB LED strips to create that
unique crack and like abyss on the front
of the case but there are many flaws yet
to go over with this one and before
getting to those this coverage is
brought to you by our patreon backers
you can go to patreon.com/scishow and
effect and that's $180 MSRP it's about
150 on new agate with current rebates
gold same thing just this top piece up
here is gold and that's the same price
180 bucks red same thing just with red
$180 and then you get to the infinity
one which is a debilitating $250
enclosure so that's an extra 70 bucks
for the RGB effect and if you factor in
the point that Newegg generally has this
thing with some kind of discount it
could actually be upwards of $100 more
for the RGB LEDs and that's a tough sell
with that $250 you get the same case but
with LEDs and with fewer options
internally the mesh front intake for
example is replaced with a solid panel
housing for the RGB LED strip and it's
mirrors the strip uses adhesive to stick
around the inner wall of the half-inch
thick shell and is flanked on either
side by mirrored surfaces creating the
Infinity effect there's no possibility
for front intake as this infinity effect
requires the entire front panel to work
its cables route internally and connect
to an LED hub which in win' dubs the
halo module and that hub splits into
SATA power USB 2.0 for control through
the
Wes and another LED cable for optional
strips and this leads us to cabling
internally n1 provides this additional
RGB LED strip actually have it right
here but they don't do much to help you
out with it this thing is 67 inches long
and I don't know if that quite
demonstrates it 67 it so it's a bit over
5 feet long and working with this in the
case is not trivial you can't just sort
of truncate this I guess you could try
and cut stuff off of it but and then
when you rout it there's really nothing
to do with the routing other than try
and go around the perimeter in which
case it's kind of like well why didn't
they do that for you so you go around
the perimeter and what happens well as
you'll see even in in one's own
marketing materials because that's how
little I guess they cared about this the
strip will route over the fan that's bad
for a number of reasons one is just that
it's kind of ugly and that's really the
only one that matters when you're
talking about lights the other one is
that if you want to replace that fan and
you've got an adhesive bound strip
you're kind of out of luck you got to
break the adhesive and and then it
starts peeling off as is also seen in
some of their marketing photos and
cabling is problematic for many more
reasons take a look at these kale
management pass throughs for instance
the holes are massive large enough to
fit a fist through and there's plainly
no benefit to that you make a large hole
in a case that you can fit bundles of
wires through there's no other point of
course and that is almost exclusively
limited to the power supply area if
you've ever looked at a case the largest
holes near the PSU cuz that's where all
of the cables are but it seems to be
everywhere with the 805 and the 805
infinity which uses the same tool in
also note that the pattern for cut out
to somewhat haphazard leaving no
continuous metal bars behind which you
could easily hide the cables there will
always be cables passing under or over
one of the holes even within ones
included but not pre-applied again cable
management clamps and the clamps are
good but they don't fix the problem this
is one of the best things that case
makers are doing today like we said with
NZXT s340 elite but an in wins case it's
not $250 good they're not pre applied
which I guess
get over and they're certainly not
enough to make up for the distinct lack
of kale management features in the case
and this is particularly confusing
because the n1 805 is another in a now
long line of cases that use tempered
glass on either side of the case glass
here and glass over here and that
exposes the cables which are not going
to be clean so if you expose the cables
at least go through the effort as a case
maker to enable the Builder to clean
their cabling up that's just really you
could do it maybe but it would take a
long time and it is difficult to close
the panel afterward this is not aided by
the fact that the n1 805 4 goes the
trendy but not always necessary power
supply shroud so they've opted out of
that which is fine not every case needs
a PSU shroud but in a case like this it
does kind of make sense and that's again
the tempered glass talking they do
however have this artsy and clearly
structural because there's holes all
through the case power supply the half
cover thing with holes in it and that
goes there I guess so out of those at
the way it's setup forces us to pull all
of the cables right in front of the
power supply older school style
including any excess molex or SATA that
you may have which you will have because
the LEDs and the front of the case
require one of those connectors each the
bottom coincidentally is also our only
source of outside air so cluttering all
the cables there is not ideal and that's
not being hyperbolic the top panel is
walled shut the front panel is clearly
preoccupied there's glass on either side
panel and there's a single 120
millimeter exhaust fan near the CPU
socket in one has even decided to use
completely flat IO covers limiting
breathing air near the GPU or SSDs if
you have PCIe devices this leaves us
with one option for intake the bottom
again although in one says two 120
millimeter fans can fit down there the
reality is that at best you're only
going to fit one the first slot will be
consumed by the PSU and its cabling for
anything normal-sized like our Corsair
RM 650 X and the second slot is covered
by the hard drive bays by default you
can relocate these cages to
the radiator mount at the front of the
case if you please but then you'd have
no radiator then again losing that slot
is irrelevant because putting a radiator
there is a bad idea it can't breathe
there's about a one-inch hole in the
bottom front where the air could be
pulled in but that's about it nothing on
the top nothing on the sides any one is
even blocking the radiator with their
artfully cutout radiator fan holes
apparently not privy to the fact that
the radiator sheds heat in more ways
than just direct airflow from the fans
with this airflow setup keep in mind
that putting this case on something like
a carpet would limit your airflow and
create potential dust problems in the
future because again that's where all
there is going to come into the case
because there's only one fan and it's
exhaust and also the power supply is
worth noting because in configurations
like this the power spot is used as part
of the cooling system we saw this with
the 600 C from Corsair in this case the
PSU fan is not facing down like you
might expect normally it's facing in so
it's pointed internally I don't know if
that was intended to be a functional
decision or was just how it came to be
but what happens is your air comes out
either at the top back or it comes out
of the power supply so if you're running
a hot video card and you're running a
power supply that you intend to be
either spun down to 0 rpm when it's in
sort of low load periods get rid of that
idea because this setup will keep the
power supply pretty consistently warmed
and that's going to require that the fan
on it is spinning you're planning to use
a fan less power spot like a digit
fanless I haven't tested it but I
probably wouldn't recommend that either
let's pause on the criticisms and
demonstrate the issue with thermals just
for a moment as always our full testing
methodology for thermal testing can be
found linked in the description in the
article below and that contains the
entire review for this case you can find
additional testing there like some noise
analysis which won't be here looking at
CPU temperatures first we're seeing the
n1 805 infinity running the CPU at its
maximum temperature which is 99 to 100
Celsius and that's on a 6700 K with only
a 10 percent overclock that's what we
test all cases with 4.4 gigahertz the
delta T over ambient puts us around 75 C
load even with the NZXT
s340 elite a case where we criticize
airflow there is a significant drop in
performance with the 805 infinity and
this is a big deal too I don't think
people pay enough attention when any
website ours or others talk about
thermals with GPUs and CVS particularly
you see folks kind of just jump to the
FPS benchmarks there's a lot more to it
than that with thermals in this case we
can see very clearly why it's important
to have lower temperatures with the CPU
running the single exhaust setup what
we're getting at the 100 C 99 c load
temperature is a reduction in the clock
so the cpu drops something like 200
megahertz at times it's not consistent
so it's an not it's not a stable clock
it drops 200 megahertz so you go from
something like 4.4 to 4.2 even 4.1 ish
sometimes and that's because of the
temperature it's trying to throttle down
to reduce its temperature and prevent a
thermal runaway or a thermal shutdown
scenario where you're hitting t.j.maxx
or something like that
as for GPUs we're pushing the limits of
what the Twin Frozr cooler can handle on
this 1080 without exceeding its 55
percent fan rpm the card is hitting 58 C
delta T over ambient or upwards of a DC
when accounting for room ambient and
this means higher fan RPMs which means
higher noise it's also an indicator that
no one should put a reference card from
either vendor in this case and finally
we can look at case ambient to see what
kind of internal temperatures we're
getting that puts us at around 40 to 45
Celsius when the thermocouple is placed
semi triangulated between the front and
the CP and the GPU coolers and that's
with a room ambient pretty chilly one of
19.5 see if you're in a hotter
environment if you're normally around 28
29 C for your room which is not
unreasonable that means the interior is
going to scale somewhat with it and that
means higher CPU and GPU temperatures
which results in either throttling or
fan speed increases so just remember
with this case if you do buy one
absolutely no multi-gpu and be careful
about PCIe expansion cards and things
like that because what happens is with
this setup it's just bad you'll get
throttling or just not great
temperatures that you really don't want
and best-case scenario
you go through the effort of removing
that hard drive cage flip it and mount
it to the front where the radiator would
go because it's a dumb place for a
radiator anyway let's be honest and so
now you freed up a spot for 120 intake
well even still unless you get a high
rpm fan or something that pushes a lot
of air the issue is that it's still just
not enough a lot of it will be sucked
into the first card and you're still
going to have thermal issues we're sure
it'll be manageable now and might not
throttle in the same way but it's just
not an ideal setup and when there are so
many other cases on the market many of
them for cheaper that have better
cooling it's hard to argue for something
like that where you have to fight for
access to one fan and then buy the fan
even though you've spent $250 on the
case as for what the 805 infinity does
well it's really just that infinity
mirror the LEDs could be better perhaps
using a light pipe instead of exposed
strips with the uneven adhesive but it's
still good overall the included
additional RGB strip is also a nice idea
and has good intentions behind it but
it's largely useless even in when routed
over the internal fan and their
marketing photos if that's not oversight
of a problem with having a five and a
half foot long cable I don't know what
is it's clearly too long considering the
length of thin might as well just be
pre-applied anyway because there's
really only one place it can go okay
wait I said we were going to talk about
the good things now and got sidetracked
and started talking about the bad things
again the Infinity effect is good and
the structure uses two millimeter thick
aluminum I'm going to I'm going to hold
off the urge to say comma but because
there's a big one there and I guess I'm
going to do it anyway it's that with
this case you can use one millimeter 1.2
millimeter steel really wouldn't
sacrifice any structural integrity that
means anything to any reasonable user
once it's built really it's going to sit
on the floor anyway and one to one point
two millimeter steel is still plenty
thick it's more than most of the cases
on the market in the $100 ish class and
it's cheaper but even so aluminum and
the RGB effect does not add up to a $250
case so there's big margins here for in
wind they could probably still stick
with aluminum and charge less and it
would at least be a little bit more
justified
but still obviously a thermal nightmare
and just to prove that this price is
absolutely crazy let's look at the
throne will take tower 900 this case is
the same price $250 and you get a lot
more for the money there's also more
material put to use here not that that's
a qualifier of how good a case is but
it's more material and that costs more
there's three glass panels there's way
better cable management and the user
cost what the consumer pays is the same
the point isn't to say that you should
buy the Thermaltake tower 900 instead
because they're a bit different clearly
different in design but to show that the
805 infinity is over valuing itself if a
larger case with better cabling design
superior cooling and more materials
overall can run the same price n1 must
be making good margins on this thing or
have a pretty bad deal with their
factory but we toured it and it seems
more like a margins issue their biggest
cost is probably the two millimeter
thick aluminum or the glass those RGB
strips are not expensive even be quiets
dark bass 900 which we saw at Computex
is the same price it's about $250 for
the premium model with tempered glass
and you can invert the motherboard tray
and move all the components around
internally and it's huge that's not
cheap to do it's not cheap to make and
it's the same price as this case and it
definitely cools better now the look is
different and that's half of what
matters with cases but the price doesn't
quite match so what I'm saying here is
that the n1 805 infinity the front of
it's really cool what I think should
have happened is in when n1 showed off
their prototype at CES 2016 and they
showed this case with that front panel
the conversation should have been more
of a this is what our idea is do you
like it or not and then when people said
yes which they did in our comments for
that video especially when people said
yes and when should have taken that idea
and stuck it on a better case that
didn't already suck so and it's not the
worst case in the world don't get me
wrong the 805 base model is not bad you
can certainly work with it it has all
the same cable management problems
because the same tooling but you have
front intake on that it's a mesh front
intake
there's a dust filter all that stuff by
your own fans and it'll work fine the
thermals won't be nearly as much
concerned as long as you buy fans for
the front of the 8:05
but the 805 infinity because we lose
that front intake now you have an issue
not only with the kale management which
is already a known issue even 2n when
when we talk to them about it but you
have an issue with thermals and the
quality it's okay in terms of build
quality it's just there's other points
when you start lacking them it gets
really hard to justify case especially
when it costs as much as a GTX 1060 or
RX 480 so if the price drops or if the
only thing you care about in life is the
front panel and it does look pretty cool
then maybe it'd be justifiable as a
purchase until that time what I'd like
to see is for n when to take this write
it off as poor design steal the front
panel off and stick it on something
that's better designed and I'll give out
some free ideas here the first one would
be to either cut some holes in the top
so now you resolve some of your fan
issues and this has been done before
just stick an intake fan up there top
front done it works fine it pushes air
straight into the CPU cooler silverstone
has done it for ages in some of their
cases we've tested it it works fine even
though kind of the standard approach is
to do exhaust at the top because hot air
rises doesn't really matter that much
and testing the next thing is to figure
out this mess up here may be a power
supply shroud or if that's really hated
I don't know maybe not do glass on the
backside so that you're not so neurotic
about getting those cables perfect
because they can be seen so those are
the basic thoughts on this case for now
I would say probably pass if it drops
250 bucks it's worth looking into maybe
buying if you really want tempered glass
look at the s340 elite it's flawed but
not bad look at the Corsair 460 X and
look at the other Corsair case the 570 X
which is more expensive close to this
price point but larger so as always
