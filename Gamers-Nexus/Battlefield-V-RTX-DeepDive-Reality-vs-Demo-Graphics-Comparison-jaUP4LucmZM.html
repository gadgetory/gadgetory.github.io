I was on the right and the actual game
is on the left and if you look over at
the train god damn
you've seen the r-tx performance numbers
for battlefield 5 but what we haven't
seen a lot of yet is a deep dive
graphics discussion and that's what
we're doing today so we're to be talking
about every single aspect of RDX in
battlefield 5 how its implemented how it
works and what the significant changes
are that you need to pay attention to so
that's this will cover low vs. ultra
quality settings will be covering screen
space versus non screen space
reflections all different aspects and
joining me is Andrew from our team who
is also a 3d artist and has a lot of
experience working with this type of
graphics before that this video is
brought to you by iy power and the rush
delivery to you program the fresh rdy
approach gets high-end gaming pcs
shipped the same day you order them and
is also one of the only places you can
get a 99 hundred K for a reasonable
price right now systems include the rdy
enthusiast level game PC with a 20 80 TI
900 K and 16 gigabytes of 32 hundred
megahertz memory available with same-day
shipping or pickup locally these systems
are built by people who are experienced
builders and component choice that makes
sense
learn more at the link in the
description below let's get this out of
the way first in a tech demo the iconic
demonstration that NVIDIA and dice had
were the eyes on the characters where
you saw fire reflections in the eyes and
so just to answer that question of did
it make it into the game and you can see
the playback of the original demo now
the answer is well sort of
there is muzzle flash in the eyes of
characters and multiplayer but and ER if
we go back and look at the tech demo the
first question here is are we seeing the
same resolution you think of or same
reflection quality as we see in the
final product this is a really high yeah
I was gonna say this as well it's
definitely a lot higher fidelity than
the final game has it's the final game
looks a lot smaller than a lot noisier
and the playback in the tech time I was
really high frame rate as well in the
eyes specifically which is just
interesting it speaks to the quote level
of quality being maintained throughout
that demonstration but we're also seeing
a whole lot of
some kind of visual artifacting right
and dice has acknowledged this as well
and some of their bug release notes so
they've actually noted that they because
we're seeing the artifact in primarily
around the cheekbone and on the bridge
of the nose yeah and their patch notes
they said art affecting on the face with
r-tx on okay and did they fix it or did
they have come in a fix okay so for
quality of what we're seeing then in the
eye is just a giant red orange flash
yeah and there's no there's no real
shape to it it is a different type of
fire well no it's a muzzle flash so
different perspective but it did make it
into the game for the next clip let's
compare it low versus ultra so there's
been some discussion as to whether this
has any actual visual impact or there
any differences at all there are there
are some differences so we have here a
shot of the car but more importantly we
have a shot of the puddles of water
behind it between low and ultra and the
main things that we noticed were some
changes in the puddle on the road and
some changes on top of the card right so
the changes that you're seeing are
around places where water is touching
bricks like at the border of the puddle
and we think that's because the
roughness of those bricks would be a lot
lower compared to the completely dry
bricks
okay so changing the roughness threshold
then this is the the point at which the
material reflects the environment via
r-tx and changing the roughness
threshold is something we're seeing here
at Ultra we have some numbers here so
you were suggesting anything probably
below a zero point for roughness per an
Nvidia engineers recommendation for
optimal threshold is probably going to
be shown on altra yes and then anything
below probably 0.1 is going to be shown
on low yes okay so then what does that
mean so around 0.4 like 0.3 to 0.5 is
around the roughness of an oily people
not that oily but a regular human faces
skin depending on their age in oiliness
and wetness and then anything around
point one would be someplace around like
shiny like polished metals somewhere or
like
I ball so the scale for roughness is
zero to one like a lot of things in
graphics and zero is going to be the
glossiest right and then one will be of
the roughest and this scale is useful we
have a well we have another example we
can show actually that's pretty useful
and this is a plane so this is a downed
plane in the game and if you look
closely at the top corner the left side
of the plane
you'll notice that there's some fire
reflection between low and ultra and
that reflection is a lot it's stretched
out it's it's visible over a longer part
of the plane with the ultra settings so
then why is that and how does that
relate back to what we're saying with
roughness and glossiness so the painted
part of the plane would be a lot rougher
than the scratch metal surface of the
plane where you can see underneath the
paint and so when you turn it to low
it's only focusing on the scratched
shiny pieces of metal and that's because
that that's reaching the threshold
that's gonna be lower on the numerical
scale so you're gonna be closer to zero
with the scratch metal surface whereas
with the painted surface you're gonna be
closer to one not that close to one but
your going towards maybe 0.4 or
something like that so I think our
conclusion on this then for the graphic
settings between ultra-low and all the
steps in between it's just it's changing
the roughness threshold again the point
at which the material is sort of
reflecting the environment yes and
anything below the threshold is is no
longer being reflected which will
conserve resources while still
reflecting something somewhere it's just
going to be primarily in the shinier
surfaces okay let's talk about object
kollene and reflection : next we have a
series of examples for this starting
with the train so for the train
reflection this is with r-tx on and set
to ultra and as we sort of step past the
distance threshold you'll see that the
sign in the back left corner of the shot
is either reflected or not reflected so
this is probably related to how objects
are normally cold in games where they're
distant space and the further away you
get you get some pop in or pop out right
the game decides that it's not
necessary to take up resources for it so
somehow they're also doing that within
the reflections of raytrace objects I
think the most interesting thing about
this is that you can see what's behind
the hotel sign when it's gone right yes
it's not like it's it's it's information
that's given to you up until the point
that you're punished for having too high
of a graphics setting so for the fire
reflections we're looking at some screen
space versus non screen space detail
here and when you're pointing the camera
down what's what's happening well so the
weird thing is that this is still our TX
on on ultra but it's acting as if it's a
screen space reflection when the fire
goes out of frame of the camera then it
pops away as if there was a screen space
reflection but it everything else is
still being a ray traced so it's just it
an oddity I suppose yes and we see a lot
of this where we actually we have some
other examples in here like talking
about the boats in the water for example
for screen space versus non screen space
so what's what's going on here in terms
of screen space reflections so here you
can see as you dip the camera down to
where the boats are at a frame then the
reflections also get cut off at that
exact point but the boats are still
being rendered because their shadows are
still there and that goes for everything
in the entire game not even in this game
just that's how screens waste
reflections work in all games you can
also see in some other clips where the
reflection is occluded by another object
there's some artifacting in the
reflections as well and it's not just
for large objects you see what paper -
yeah just a tiny little specks that are
causing very large streaks in the water
that shouldn't be there yes and those
streaks are because the object is
including the water as it's moving over
it and we have a bit of a latency on the
update for where the object is versus
what it's including so is this then if
there's no traditional way to fix that
is this something that RT X can solve I
feel like this is basically what our DX
is all about they're trying to get rid
of these small artifacts that have been
in games for decades now yeah it's just
it's
very expensive in terms of resources to
do this right which is the downside that
you all see so we have an example here
from another what game is this this is a
dragon quest 11 okay dragon quest so we
have an example of screen space
reflections in here and this is only
we've talked about before you'll notice
that the window is reflecting the front
of the character when the character is
facing the camera so why is that the
reflection doesn't know anything besides
what Sun screen so it doesn't know what
the back of the character looks like
when the back of the character is facing
away from the camera yes hence hence the
name screen space reflection so what
we're showing here then is there's the
window behind us right the player is
crawling through the window are boarding
it up or something and actually it ran
past or it the player they ran past me
to the right to go up to the window but
this is I feel like this is an
interesting thought for a competitive
play yes so how so would it be unfair if
you could see around corners or behind
you in ways that other players
yes unfair okay that's a definition of
unfair I think this is something that
will if there's any kind of competitive
or eSports play emerging around this
it'll have to be normalized for there'll
have to be a set of rules for you know
banning or allowing it I don't know I
don't know that's the thing I don't know
how it's beneficial here because I could
see you camping in a corner just looking
at the painting to try and figure out
what's going on behind you or something
around a corner right but at the same
time that's probably not the most
effective way to play the game either
that's true probably more effective to
be out completing objectives so maybe it
doesn't really matter in the grand
scheme of things but certainly in some
games I could see like in camp happy
games I could see this being an unfair
advantage or like if you're hiding
behind cover and there's a car on your
side of the cover and you can look into
the car to see like a wide-angle view
right you can see in front of you and
behind you that that's like that
wouldn't really be necessary in
third-person shooters but in a
first-person shooter like this it would
make a large difference potentially yeah
so next item here we have some ice and
this is a exam
of where traditional screen-space
reflections actually are not present
when r-tx is off right so our TX on we
get the reflections in in the ice and I
don't know is there anything special
about these are abnormal we want to
point out or they they just reflections
they're just reflections and then you
turn off our TX and you get this which
is just a flat surface right and I
honestly don't have any explanation for
why they wouldn't use screen spaced
reflections here because they could
maybe artistic choice or maybe they
overlooked it I don't know there's a lot
of things that could happen those
wonders are interesting is that these
buildings are like way out of average
player map area so the fact that these
windows have our TX on means that it's
just like a blanket rule across all
surfaces right and it doesn't just to be
clear here if you're having a flashback
to our Final Fantasy 15 coverage we're
not saying that this is being rendered
at all times right we're just saying
that it's being rendered when you are
near the object even if it's out of
bounds of play so yeah just some kind of
blanket rule across all windows or
something I think it's across all
services I don't think they're going
through and saying like this building
should have r-tx from this object show
Parcheesi so just check all services for
what roughness right yes so just do a
roughness check against everything and
see if it falls within the threshold for
ultra low whatever your setting is all
right this is RTX ultra but there's no
reflections anywhere in the river of
anything like we're looking straight
down at the water we should be able to
see the bridge that River right now that
we should be able to see the bridge but
anywhere that you look it's not
reflecting on even screen space
reflections there's just no reflections
like the ice but this is our TX ultra so
then why why is this I mean is it how
how granular is the implementation I
guess is it oh we missed that object
that doesn't seem like a good way to
implement it right like if those windows
that were way out of bounds head right
ray tracing then this probably should
let's get back to the train that we had
in the intro where the player on the
tank
my shot so this was shown heavily in
Nvidia's tech demo and it came out
looking a bit different so you disable
RT acts completely and videos tech demo
showed some extremely blurry kind of
weird reflections yeah
very blurry and very clear at the same
time right
well yeah clears in like very opaque ish
reflections right
yes yes very opaque so is you don't have
as much transparency in these windows so
the tech demo if you're going solely
based off of that it does look like r-tx
off is worse than it is in reality which
is unfortunate now that doesn't mean
that video did something evil the ice
probably prepared most the demo it could
also be that it was really enough in
development that they hadn't finished it
if you want to give them the benefit of
the doubt but ultimately it's relevant
it makes RT X off look worse than it is
and that has happened several times over
the course of promoting RT X where you
get features you get gameplay showing
games without even traditional faked
lighting which is just disingenuous so
all this noise is being caused because
since the water surface keeps moving
it's not having enough time to solve for
the create what the correct reflection
would be with only having one sample per
pixel which is hardly anything yes that
is very limited so when you go back to
screen space reflections since it
doesn't have to do any of that the water
that the noise is completely gone the
water it looks clear but there's nothing
reflected in the water anymore
yeah and depending on your perspective
here off might look better than on if
you really hate noise ion does have more
reflections clearly but it's also just
blasted with noise so that might be a
quality-of-life thing to keep in mind I
guess if you want to debate over whether
or not you think that's worth it but
r-tx overall then the implementation I
mean what do we what do we think about
it here it's clearly the performance
impact is massive hopefully this video
helps people understand why it's massive
in some ways there are clearly also some
anomalies like we don't understand why
that bridge wasn't reflected or why
there's no reflections and
the ice with r-tx off right why there's
no screen space reflection with the eyes
or why in the tech demo of that train
looked worse than it does in the endgame
we can maybe give them the benefit of
the doubt on that I feel like my
conclusion of how RT X is implemented is
that it is always very noisy still noisy
and just to really be clear here that's
what the film grain off yes if anyone
wants to comment and say oh you guys are
idiots you get film grain on no it's
just noise from our G act so then is
there first of all we're probably going
to see similar noise I think in other
games yeah I don't think this is
battlefield specific and then is there a
solution too because the noise to me is
probably other than the performance is
the worst part of the art current r-tx
implementation what is is there a path
to a solution
I think NVIDIA is doing this also they
need to improve their denoising
technology I think that's where the
source of most of this is because if you
even if you just take start taking two
samples per pixel which is still nothing
now you're doubling the amount of
resources yes you have to use for that
specific function yeah for RTX
processing right yes the and if if
that's happening when your frame rates
already drop in significantly like
halved
then asking for another another 100
percent increase in sampling is a large
ask for Nvidia so that's our recap
hopefully that helps you understand the
graphics better and the technology
behind it how it works why why the
performances is bad but also you know
what it is anybody needs to improve on
because this is not a perfect
implementation despite the performance
cost speaking subjectively here does not
seem necessarily worth the visuals
especially because NVIDIA has been
driving for K so hard I mean onstage
Jensen said this is the first 4k 60fps
GPU ever even though they launched their
1080i
the same phrasing and you play any game
with like a 1080 or something for k62
drop the settings enough but given all
of that marketing now they've got our
checks where you are basically playing
1080p at 60 not 4k definitely not 4k in
this game so it's it's a step backwards
in resolution and performance and so
you're sacrificing resolution you're
sacrificing anti-aliasing because you
need to give up other graphics options
in order to gain r-tx and that does not
necessarily seem worth it depending on
really what your end goal is for the
game especially if it's just weird for a
shooter anyway
yeah something so high action high
action and single-minded you're you know
you your real goal is is competitive
it's not like it's an RPG or something
where the goal is immersion it's a bit a
bit odd overall but there's what we
