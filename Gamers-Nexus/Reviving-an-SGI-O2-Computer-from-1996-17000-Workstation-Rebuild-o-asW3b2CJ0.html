today we are building the SGI o2 so we
previously built the indigo two extreme
yes and it was pretty cool system it's
like it was a $34,000 system and from
the early 90s is all from the 90s this
is also from Ian again from SGI Depot
who sent it along for us to build and
we're gonna spend some more time with a
software today so this one assembly is
pretty straightforward so after we get
it assembled I think we have blender on
here and then quake and a couple of
other things we can look at and we also
have a blender benchmark of this versus
an 80 600 k yeah yeah that's what was in
the suspend time so yes it wasn't
particularly important to get to make it
a like-for-like comparison so we'll go
through that today starting with the
assembly and of course our thanks again
to ian from SGI depot for sending the
salon before that this video is brought
to you by the gigabyte ARS ad 27 QD
gaming monitor the ad 27 QT is a 27-inch
1440p gaming display with 95% of dcpip 3
color saturation for high color accuracy
accompanied by a 1 millisecond response
time 10 bit IPS panel and display HDR
visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs from
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles and
adaptive a noise reduction
learn more at the link below so here's
the system this is do to Patrick do you
want to walk us through some of the
parts yeah so we have the power supply
here it's got a bunch of warnings on the
bottom about not removing the cover and
we haven't done that but it's also got
kind of a cool grounding strip on the
bottom there yes it's a squishy so Sony
made power supply hard drive that is not
original to the system it would have
shipped with 2 or 4 gigabyte hard drive
but this is a 37 36 point 7 gigabytes
gauzy drive yeah it's a lot more and
what about the CPU is is this also in
our series CPU yes
our 5200 megahertz and we can't tell who
manufactured at this time last night was
Toshiba for reference yeah so CPU is is
on I guess the motherboard and it's
already pasted you said yeah this is the
heatsink assembly this is the CPU
daughterboard and both of these heat
sinks are pasted on and we don't really
want to peel this off there's no screws
or anything underneath right so the last
time indigo2 we have some footage of it
we can show where we we pulled the
heatsink off the cpu and that actually
it looks very similar to what's in this
box so it wasn't exactly this model but
the Indigo 2 had a similar CPU to that
under the heatsink and so other than the
CPU daughterboard there's some memory
slots and what do we know what type of
memory this is no but we're not 100%
sure so just to be clear here neither
Patrick nor I are experts on SGI this
was sort of before our time of working
with computers so when is this this is a
90
this is 96 the other one was 93 okay so
we're not experts Ian's certainly is Ian
sent everything along has everything
documented but yes we have I think is it
eight six this time two four six eight
sticks of memory last time I was 12 and
do you know how what the capacity is
yeah this is 256 megabytes which was the
maximum when the system launched they
raised that so one gigabyte later but
this is maximum respect for the launch
of the system okay and then what about
this thing here that is av input so
there's a lot of analog video
connections on there and then on the end
there's the o2 cam connector we don't
have an o2 camera but that's where you
would hook that up and presumably this
interacts with the case or something
yeah I think that's like a locking
mechanism we do not have the case so
unfortunately can't show you the case
and then you told me an interesting fact
about this - yeah
and said this is technically not a Navy
board this is just an a board yeah but
that's gee I ran I guess the audio only
boards were more popular and they ran
out and their solution of that was just
to sell the AV boards with plastic
covers glued over the video inputs so
they just cover the video and then you
have to cover off and then you have
video so financially maybe not the best
for them yeah it worked out well though
they're bankrupt now haha what is this
that is the front plane that's what
everything connects together with and
see it comes with tape well I that's my
Edition I took some creative liberties
it's dated 96 I think all these parts
are dated 96 they're not all from the
same system but they are all from the
same time and the made in USA stamp is
scratched out on both sides and replaced
with Malaysia I think on this side made
in Malaysia and we're not quite sure
what the story is behind that but we did
not do that so don't get mad at us all
right so let's let's start assembling it
I guess I'll let you wherever you want
to start yeah maybe yeah we can do that
listen and then while Patrick's working
on that I have some notes to that you
took so the cutsy interesting things for
people who know the are 4400 which was
an hour indigo to you say was licensed
to IDT lsi any see performance
semiconductor Siemens AG and Toshiba yes
I guess those were the the manufacturing
sources yes
NORs was made by Toshiba right and ours
was 200 megahertz our 4400 that was in
94 and we did some more research on that
too so that if modern TB is everyone's
talking at 7 nanometre getting down to 7
or 10 nanometer for Intel and the are
4400 that we used was 300 nanometer
process which actually is smaller than I
would
a guest and it was $2,150 know according
to Wikipedia so it's a 2150 according to
Wikipedia and that is we don't think
that's adjusted for inflation but we're
not sure I guess and then the the o2 the
one that you're working on now so
daughterboard here we have an R 5,000
right hmm also made IDT NEC and KK that
is a terrible noise yes and the uh let's
see do those go in just straight down at
all the memory six yeah or that you go
in and out of angles um they going
straight down but you know a little bit
yes sir the are three thousand a 1.2
micrometer process I guess mm-hmm yeah
and that was so 1.2 used for Sony
Playstation you say was that the ps1
yeah I guess okay
and this is all I guess we called MIPS
is this all MIPS architecture all of it
or do you know yeah but licensed out to
other companies for production and I
think you're getting them another
Nintendo is next right yeah our 4300 I
350 nanometer process used for the n64
and I think that console is probably one
of the the most recognizable of all time
so n64 license to NEC referred to as the
NEC VR 4300 not virtual reality in this
instance not quite they yeah not quite
that would be the virtual boy still
better than the rift there are fifty
nine hundred 250 nanometer process CPU
was used for the PlayStation 2 and then
MIPS we did some research on as well so
SGI I guess you say they were a customer
at first of MIPS yeah and MIPS did the
architecture for these yeah so they were
a customer and then they I guess wanted
to protect their investment in the
company and
eventually bought MEPs just bothered
company yeah and so SGI acquired mips in
92 for 333 million dollars and there's
new IPO and 98 and then eventually
became a separate company again in 2000
when SGI started to or wanted to use
intel yeah that's one of the things that
Ian mentioned a few times is that SGI
jumped the gun on announcing that they
wanted to move to intel parts and then
they took a really long time to do that
I'm guessing they already damaged their
relationship with MIPS yeah probably
yeah so a fabulous company or were a
fabric or business MIPS MIPS was a
fabulous company you're saying yeah they
continued oh yeah continues to be a
fabulous design company AMD is another
example of a fabulous company Nvidia
another for headless company okay so the
o2 specifically though this system now
that you're getting it sort of assembled
and this right here will show this the
camera - that's just a connector so I
think like the last one this is all
cable this there's theoretically a cable
for the optical drive again but we don't
have an optical drive for this either
okay yeah so I feel like I'm comfortable
with how that's German yeah so this is
we're not supposed to use this for the
Indigo - because it's clearly labeled Oh
- kit nine so we're using it for the
proper yes our our sincere apologies in
the last video we had an egregious error
and used the fratello pack which i think
is a british starburst knockoff I'm not
sure he's the fratello pack to support
the graphic set we may go to extreme
somebody really angry with that they've
probably found it in like 1912 or
something
the original starburst so Fratelli uclan
was the original starburst I'm not
claiming anything I would never claim
anything on uses so all of these parts
would be supported by plastic sleds and
trays and stuff in the case but since we
don't have
this is the in solution yes and it works
well enough so and we can find a photo
of the case or something online - what
is this thing that is the I think it's
labeled it's a CI tray yeah
required for normal operation if removed
it must be reinstalled before restart
yes okay so the Sun you can connect into
it yes this is we put in right here
pretty easy to identify with the slot
layout yeah and then we connect this we
do this is this right here that looks
like it these pens yeah
so some pens on the board and those
connect into there I guess yeah okay
that's connected yes yeah so at this
point we're done because we don't have
the optical drive or some of the other
extras that would attach to this and it
is a pretty modular cable this system
right so this this is a fully functional
or - as it is right now
I'm scared okay here so there's a more
interesting shop for you of the
motherboard in here so you've got the
higher component density in there so
expect for the system are 5000 is 200
megahertz CPU with one megabyte of l2
cache
you said 256 megabytes of RAM for this
mm configuration we think based on what
Ian said who was again the the expert
who loaned or sent this out to us we
think this was like a 16 or 17 thousand
dollar
he said 1717 $17,000 we don't know if
that's adjusted or anything are
converted from from pounds or USD or
what and you could increase this to one
gigabyte capacity
let's see you say the BIOS equivalent
has Mouse control and also true with the
Indigo - and then what is this aw real
demo you wrote about yeah I was just
taking some notes of software demos that
we can show off later when we get this
turned on okay yeah there's some
interesting stuff on there okay cool
well yeah I guess we'll boot it up and
take a look at the software then and
we'll spend more time there on on this
one because I think it's a bit more
interesting too so I walked away for a
second and Patrick started installing
AOL we have a hat we got it booted it's
working this is we I guess it's a
Windows 95 virtual machine mm-hmm and
we've got a o/l in the background so
we're multitasking here and it's gone
and we have a solitaire so I guess this
is what you do with your seventeen
thousand dollar computer you you emulate
Windows 95 and you play solitaire other
than this though other than the emulate
would be a virtual machine which is
actually of course a very useful
application there's presumably other
stuff on here yes there's in told us
that this I think this is probably the
largest thing that's installed so the
windows 95 yeah we could delete it if we
want in the free up space but I don't
have a lot of oh I've heard that song
before I don't have a lot of SGI
software that I really need the free I'm
sorry I think that sound is used in
every grade a under a video ever made
so it's rough it's uh Andrew we did it
we did our TX it's not a toaster this is
the yes jo - sorry yes this is actually
a really impressive demo we can barely
that's kind of small reads an inventor
file or if we have any other adventure
files that IV looks like there's a few
of them moves plastic mm-hmm this is the
moose that's why the front plane is
labeled in this head okay mystery solved
that makes sense
toast
totus they call it a toaster so this one
runs a lot better because there's no
reflections on it yeah this is genuinely
pretty impressive like for the for the
era yeah so the reflection is a map of a
photo I think right it's really far from
it's a bar some place they use it a lot
in 3d testing power really looks like
blenders monkey head okay so this like
it this is a common one how do you think
the reflection is done I was like map it
onto it or something
yeah you don't think it's real time ray
tracing so what what do we have for like
blender I think I've noticed from you
previously you ran blender version 2.4
for mm-hmm so it's got bun 22.4 for I
think there's a test file on here as
well yeah this is just a standard test
file that Ian had and I think this was
created with version 2.4 for in mind
right which makes our comparisons very
unfair yes they're very
anyway but we used blended 2.79 on and
if we just had an ad 600k set to 5
gigahertz that was on the task bench so
I move the test file over there and then
you ran the benchmark so it's it's not
like for like blender versions but you
really can't blame us when we're talking
our hardware from the mid-90s it's kind
of hard to equalize things so this is a
rendering now I guess yeah I can't you
tell sort of this um this this render
took or was it eighty two point three
minutes it took to complete yeah
according to his benchmarks it with this
spec it should be taking less time than
that okay there's some things maybe
setup wrong yeah I don't know okay well
either way what do we know what his
benchmarks were I think his were more
around like 45 minutes to an hour
or even our hardware okay well either
way let's if we take yen's numbers and
we're not sure how how these were
exactly tested I guess 45 to an hour
versus 82 either way just to give you
perspective on why that massive
difference is not particularly relevant
for comparing to these 600 K ladies 600
K did it in about 9 seconds so even if
we're off by 50% it is still a massive
difference
but yeah so somewhere in that range for
the for the render on this I guess it
might depend on the soft reconfiguration
to to some extent because if you I don't
know how blender in this version is but
current version you can change samples
and things like that speed it up yeah
and so Ian said and see he said really
though their systems were never about
how fast one could process data rather
they were about how much one could
process and he says that's how John
Massey phrased it to him and said
bandwidth coping with big data sets etc
they often did hold straight CPU speed
records as well though so so that's
blender what else do we have on here we
have a anything interesting quake or you
know won't waver
No it's kind of wild that I mean we just
took this blend file and put it in
modern blender and it just opens up the
output looks different but um how
different does it like the lighting
smoother no it's the output image on
this is kind of noisy okay so that is
impressive there that you just straight
move the file yeah just nice and and
just to kind of be clear here you know
we're giving perspective on like the
blender around Orion speeds modern
versus then this system was extremely
impressive for its time because if you
look at some of the graphics demos we
have ha ha an overpowered here so on the
graphics demos we have from the Indigo 2
as well for they they're really pretty
impressive you can get some basic
physics simulation soft body physics
simulation with cloth stuff like that so
very impressive hardware and very
high-end although it is having some
trouble with quake yeah if we had a
better CPU in the system I think it
would handle it pretty well but as it is
you can launch quake also it's worth
interesting that I mean quake was never
officially released on these systems I'm
elated well they're ports by my fans
this is like SGI quake or something like
that is the name of the project it's a
fan port oh yeah and the doom version
that's on the Indigo 2 is also and
pretty context this is on a mouse
movement right now I don't know the
default quake controls at all okay
alright it take a wild guess what do you
think out what are you looking for
well I for fire control is it ok nice
another quake so I want to sort of
campaign I feel like I don't want to
start you get out of this level just to
see if it's any faster or somewhere else
alright I'm ready for a normal skill but
I don't remember what my weapon switches
oh it was faster for a second yes this
is the third episode primal fear in the
strange dimension dot dot dot tell that
was written by the programmer and this
is just as fun to play as it seems like
this is also a mechanical mouse a
mechanical mouse internet bobhouse
the Corsair m60 3 mm RGB BM is for
mechanical yeah you didn't have to send
us a ball Mouse but I guess it is more
authentic most psu connector my sword
all mice of course are made the the MM
600 mechanical ball mouse or whatever
for April Fool's yeah the M 63 mm RGB
mechanical ball mouse will be available
later this month we really think you're
gonna enjoy our exclusive big ball of
technology they've got me calling it a
mechanical mouse cuz that's what they
didn't April Fool's Day good job Corsair
what else do we have on here
yeah let's again here with this weight
hood when this is my favorite part where
they credit the sound effects to Trent
Reznor and nine inch nails really he did
the soundtrack but it's CD audio so I
don't actually know the soundtrack will
play so there's there's our look at the
o2 we're not sure if this one has is
performing that exactly where it should
be I don't know it's kind of hard to
tell so we'll check with ian on that but
yeah it's for what we have seen it's
very impressive
especially the demo of the the non
retraced reflections enclosure for the
case and it's got Maya on there we
didn't have any demo files that we could
find I don't think so
we couldn't load up a demo for that but
we did have blender and we had some
demos for blender and for obviously the
hardware of the era it is pretty
impressive but quake unfortunately was
not running at a frame rate that was
really acceptable for play even by our
standards so so that's it for this one
