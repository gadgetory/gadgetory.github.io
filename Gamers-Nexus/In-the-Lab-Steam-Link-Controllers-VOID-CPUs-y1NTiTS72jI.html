dotnet and this is our first episode of
a new segment we're calling the shop and
the whole purpose of this is to give you
a behind-the-scenes look and some sneak
peeks at upcoming hardware maybe games
but mostly hardware that we're working
on behind the scenes what we're working
on reviewing and testing actively and
hopefully provide some insight earlier
as to what we think of those products
before the finalized review so this week
we're working on a few things we've got
to steam controllers with a steam link
I'll talk about those in a moment we've
got the corsair void headset Logitech's
new G 933 wireless headset which i
reviewed the G 633 wired version of it
basically the same thing with a couple
of differences and like Wireless and
then we've also got the MSI be 150 a pro
motherboard and a couple of new Intel
skylake skews four cpus and I'm going to
be honest I actually don't know what
skews they are just yet because I
haven't connected them to a board yet
and the IHS on the CPUs is marked as
Intel confidential so haven't plugged
them in yet don't know what they are but
should be fun to test and we'll get a
more complete intel sky like cpu lineup
out there soon in terms of benchmarks
but let's go back to the steam stuff so
from valve we have to steam controllers
and the steam link the controllers are
somewhat similar to the Xbox 360
controller if you have an xbox 360
wireless controller the profile is
similar but the buttons are actually
pretty different and this is maybe
something that most of you already know
but the main thing is the input device
so instead of using multiple analog
joysticks valve has opted for a haptic
input device for the right thumbstick
and also for the d-pad so when you roll
around on those you'll feel a haptic
vibration similar to what you get from
modern phones when texting so that's
pretty interesting we're working on
reviewing that and then the steam link
is probably the lesser-known of steam
and valves hardware operation right now
the link is similar to the doco if you
remember that from NZXT and the link
basically serves as a video and USB
pass-through to transfer your remotely
rendered game data to a TV so the way
that works is you have a system set up
maybe in you
bedroom or whatever and that's rendering
your game content with your high-end GPU
cpu all that that uses the on die
encoder on the GPU passes that data via
internet land to the link and then the
link passes that data via HDMI to your
TV the purpose of this is to allow
remote rendering of your game content
and playback on maybe like a family TV
or family room set up living room set up
something like that the objective being
more group or party style play of games
without having the main be spc located
adjacent to the TV and the steam link
also serves as a USB passthrough so you
connect your controllers your wireless
keyboard things like that to the link
which is located near your TV may be
mounted to the back of it you connect
those two the link that takes the USB
input passes it to your remote system
which then processes the input as
normally as you would normally process
it then passes back and forth for
whatever other data you're transmitting
between the two devices so this
introduces some latency to your input
and we're not sure what that latency is
just yet we haven't measured it yet
that's hence this video but the latency
should be pretty low and then just brief
hands-on plane I can tell you that it is
pretty unnoticeable for most games now
if you're playing competitively playing
competitive csgo you want to mitigate
that latency wherever possible and
trying to compete with a pass-through
device is probably not the best idea but
for most other games it's it's fine it's
certainly playable for RPGs and things
of that nature moving on to the corsair
void this is Corsairs wireless headset
so this is a pretty cool one I actually
really like this so far the review is
forthcoming of course I'm sure I'll have
some things to complain about it as
always but overall I do like this
headset quite a bit and it looks like
it's going to become my primary headset
pushing aside the plantronics gamecom
780 8 which is actually for a 50 to 60
dollar headset when my favorite options
out there so the void is very good the
corsair void is $150 wireless headset
uses a radiofrequency transmitter
connected to basically an amplifier if
you have the the special edition
whatever it's called limited edition
maybe and that connects to us
so you have a USB going to a dongle that
extends the range of the radiofrequency
transmitter the wireless transmitter
that connects to your headset and I've
gotten pretty good range i can walk
probably it's about 60 70 feet line of
sight i mean if you have a straight line
to the receiver transmitter then you get
about 70 feet if you're working around a
house obviously it's different because
you have walls that damage the range of
the signal pretty heavily but i can
still walk around a couple of rooms with
that problem so i'm a fan of that and i
like using it for conference calls press
events things like that where i can just
walk around mute my mic and continue
doing things that i actually need to do
while listening to the press event so
pretty cool the audio quality is very
good I haven't done a direct comparison
yet with a g9 33g 633 headsets from
Logitech but it is certainly up there
competing with them if not slightly
worse you're slightly better than them
and the microphone is decent quality
it's better than the logitech headset
quality from our previous review you can
check that out and surprisingly it's
still not quite as good as the game calm
but it's it's a good Mike I can't
complain too much so more on that coming
up that is an RGB headset price at one
hundred fifty dollars and we'll have a
full review pretty soon I'm not sure one
yet but either this week end of this
week or early next the next item we're
looking at is MSI's be 150 a pro gaming
motherboard so this is a be 150
motherboard as indicated by the name
that means it's chipset is be 150 not
the Z 170 flagship chipset that we've
all become familiar with the performance
great chipset and we also looked at in
h1 70 board the biostar board reviews
already on the site video reviews
forthcoming so we had a couple of boards
to look at with this msi be 150 a pro
motherboard the be 150 board is
technically using a chipset classified
for business by intel but it's perfectly
fine for gaming as well similar to the h
17 th 110 you can kind of use it for
mainstream for gaming whatever as long
as you're not overclocking that's the
primary limitation of these non ze
chipsets is the overclocking so we're
gonna be looking at the
power draw the boot times the security
features that's a big thing for the
business class chipsets even if it is in
a gaming motherboard looking at all that
pretty soon as far as the colors on the
scheme one thing I did like quite a bit
about this already was on the right side
of the board there's a little strip
that's oddly colored it's it's sort of
undyed motherboard and I need to confirm
with MSI if that's a pre-production
thing or if that's the final sample of
the board but what I can tell you for
sure is that there are LEDs in this
strip off to the side you can run them a
couple different colors but it looks
good as red because the rest of the
board is red and black and that's just
sort of a neat feature LEDs are
definitely becoming a big thing lately
with the keyboards the headsets like the
void and the Logitech ones and of course
the NZXT hue that we just looked at so
that ties the motherboard in more
closely with all the other operating
devices out there with RGB LEDs pretty
cool stuff I'm not sure how it performs
just yet so don't go buy it yet wait for
a review on that but that's kind of what
we're looking at right now so the final
two items are the sky lake CPUs and
we've got some new video card content
coming as well no new video cards but
new content and I am getting a couple of
existing cards in stock for our first
run-through on the r9 380 x for example
I've only tested the 380 and 390 at this
point but the 380 x is coming from power
color we've got a 3 90 x coming from msi
as a permanent sample that will be used
in future benchmarks particularly with
battlefront and i'm hoping to do some
updated GPU benchmarks with all the
driver changes and things like that that
have been going on lately so stay tuned
for that in terms of sky lake we've
already tested the 6700 k you can find
that content on the channel on the site
the 6600 ki have and is of course the i5
so that makes it the more popular of the
two CPUs and then we've got some other
Intel skew that as i said i'm not sure
what it is yet but I'm looking forward
to testing that as well well I'm hoping
it's a non case you will see shortly
though and and hopefully put that
through the ranks through the benchmarks
especially with a be 150 board if it is
non k otherwise a little Izzy 170 stuff
we have so all that stuff pretty cool
looking I'm excited to put out all
content we're working more on video as
you all know have the set set up have
the lights the lav mics which I'm still
trying to figure out the best way to
hide the conceal the wire but everything
is going very well here we're pretty
excited with all the benchmarking all
the feedback from you guys as always
leave comments I do read all of them are
almost all of them even if i don't reply
to all of them and if you like this type
of coverage if you want to help us out
check the patreon link in the postural
video as always huge help from those of
you on that site backing us but if you
don't have the the extra funding to
spare on patreon it's the biggest help
we can get to just share the videos post
them places share them with your friends
things like that so I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
