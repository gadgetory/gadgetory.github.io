Nexus dotnet and today we're
overclocking a GTX 980 this is a how-to
tutorial on how to overclock Maxwell
specifically looking at the GTX 980
Maxwell has changed the game quite a bit
for overclocking versus Kepler but still
pretty easy stuff we can walk through it
pretty quickly and have you going in no
time so I have written a full guide on
this that is very detailed if I skip
steps in here
check the link of the description below
for the guide and that covers everything
you could possibly want to know about
overclocking max well let's get to it
with the video component here first all
you need a few tools for this you will
need EVGA precision which I have open on
the screen here you'll need gpu-z also
open and here you're obviously going to
need the newest version of the Nvidia
drivers potentially with GFE if you want
GFE I would recommend it at this point
beyond those tools I would recommend
also setting up some kind of spreadsheet
like this one that you see on my screen
this is what I use for keeping track of
my overclocks how they perform and if
they're stable or not
and this allows me to go back in time
later if I want to rollback my changes
if I want to find a more moderate
overclock that's not quite as extreme
which is something I would recommend
doing a few after you find the maximum
overclock possible for endurance reasons
on the semiconductor so here's how
overclocking works with maxwell first of
all you'll notice in precision this is
what we are using to do the overclocking
we are increasing the frequency of the
base and boost clock and we will
increase the memory clock a little bit
as well though that's something I focus
on less as it is a bit easier to do and
a Maxwell introduces power target
percentage which is what you see here at
the top so this is how much power we are
willing to supply the GPU over its stock
100% would be about 180 watts of max TDP
now this is something that Nvidia
originally advertised to the media that
max CD he was about 165 watts for the
GTX 980 however if we look at Kepler
BIOS Tweaker I have opened the BIOS
or the GTX 980 that I have the reference
card this is a guide by the way for the
reference card your mileage will vary
for other cards and in opening the bios
we can see that at 125 % TDP we're
hitting about 225 watts now at a hundred
percent we're at 180 watts so a 180
watts a 125 percent of that or one 1.25
times 180 is 225 so that means the board
the PCB the vrm and the GM 204 chip
itself can handle a maximum 225 watts
that's pretty good but certainly nowhere
near what some of the aftermarket cards
will allow you to do so looking at the
power target here we're going to
increase that once we start hitting
walls once the overclock becomes
unstable we also have the GPU
temperature target I leave this
untouched for overclocking that's just
how hot maximally you want the GPU to
get we have the GPU clock offset which
is what we will focus the most on this
plays with the base clock boost clock
and then we have the memory clock offset
which is just overclocking the memory
we'll do that in a bit over here on the
right side we have the voltage which we
increase for stability so in the guide I
talked about the concepts of
overclocking we'll cover them very
briefly here in overclocking what you're
trying to do is increase the frequency
of the semiconductor of the chip in this
case the GP is GM 2o for GPU we're
trying to increase that boost clock and
we can increase it to an extent without
having to touch voltage it will remain
stable up to depending on your card
depending on your chip because all chips
are made differently it could be 100 50
megahertz could be honored 70 megahertz
it might be 200 megahertz before it
starts exhibiting instability and that's
very easy to do once it does exhibit
instability which is normally shown in
the way of blue flickers driver crashes
screen flickering or texture tearing
things like this once you see those
instabilities you'll need to either step
back the clock to regain stability or
increase the voltage to supply more
voltage to the Jeep
you so that it can sustain that higher
clock rate without these issues and you
only can go up to one point two five six
volts on Maxwell on the GM 204 980 chip
so we do have a limit there of how high
we can go before needing an aftermarket
card of some sort and do keep in mind
that higher voltage means higher
temperature which also threatens
stability and definitely threatens the
longevity of the card so a few
disclaimers overclocking can cause
permanent irreversible damage to your
components if you do it irresponsibly or
if you're trying for an extreme
overclock overclocking at a moderate
rate will not cause serious damage you
can definitely get a moderate overclock
out of almost any component and the life
of the system will be expired before
that component dies due to your
overclocking overclocking may also void
warranties so do keep that in mind and
they can check so tools gpu-z
we will be using for monitoring the
boost clock to make sure that overclock
is actually applied because your softer
may tell you it's applying but Boost 2.0
on Maxwell and Kepler will throttle back
the clock once it feels like there's not
enough power available or there's
stability issues so we'll throttle back
we need gpu-z to tell us specifically
what our clock is sitting at we also
need it to tell us the temperatures and
things like that
EVGA precision we're using for the
overclocking Kepler BIOS Tweaker you do
not need that's just to look at your
bios if you want to see sort of the
boost tables the power table stuff like
that this spreadsheet I would recommend
creating one exactly with these headers
and just keep track of everything sorry
for ease in the future but not necessary
certainly and then finally only 3dmark
firestrike which is a GPU benchmarking
tool this is not a is it's not something
that will load your GP 100% all the time
fire strike extreme will for the most
part but we can't use fir mark because
the boost clock has issues issues being
triggered properly in fir mark so we're
using 3d mark fire strike and there are
other burnin tools if you want to do
full burn and test let's get started for
overclocking first what we're going to
do is look at our base settings and we
are currently sitting at eleven hundred
twenty six megahertz for the GPU clock
and the boost clock is the red the red
mark here so that's a little over twelve
hundred I believe it's twelve sixteen
from memory and that's not quite good
enough for me I want some more power
than that so we're going to increase
this it's very important that you do
this incrementally I know very well with
this specific GPU I have in the system
will do but I have other gtx 980 s that
are different and they're all different
so do the same for mentally that said we
know as a general rule of thumb that you
can increase the clock at least 100
megahertz generally 150 170 megahertz
before you have any issues whatsoever
other than perhaps changing the power
target so we can just jump ahead to one
of those numbers and then after that
point will increase probably about 10 15
mega Hertz at a time eventually you hit
a wall you start doing one to five
megahertz increases so I'm going to type
in 150 right here we're doing a 150 mega
Hertz increase for now let's I'm just
going to increase the power to 110
percent I want to note running the power
target at max at 125 percent for
extended periods of time can threaten
the longevity of the GPU only run it
like that if you're doing benchmarking
then throttle it back once you find your
max number unless you're just
benchmarking so here's what we're doing
for now we're going to apply this
actually you know what let's let's
increase I will leave the memory clock
alone now
well apply this we have zero millivolt
over voltage and once we've applied this
you go to the sensors on GPUs II tell it
to log to file and we're going to give
it a name I like to title these my
settings so 150 overclock we'll call it
and save so now it is login type file
every second what we do next is open
3dmark and this will i've got 3d mark
pro or advanced or whatever it's called
and we're just going to run it I
normally run extreme you won't have this
if you have the free version so we'll
turn that off
don't need the demo so we run it when
this runs it will burn in the GPU
slightly it will basically benchmark for
framerate and stability it's a couple
minute long test I'm not going to show
all of it here but basically all you're
looking for you is stability you don't
want to walk away from this test because
it might not tell you about some
instabilities like texture tearing so
while you're watching this benchmark
keep an eye out for things like glue
flickering texture tearing black
flickering stutters anything like that
and you're going to let this run
normally you'll notice instability in
the first set of tests there are three
sets but sometimes that I don't see it
till the second one so I already know
that this is stable because I've already
done this I'm going to cancel out of
this you should let it run in full when
you let it run in full it'll give you a
report with your score which is a
made-up number calculated by fire strike
and FPS and things like that log it in
your document and also log if the
overclock was stable or not now this is
only a couple minute test so we don't
know for sure if it's going to be stable
in the long term but once you start
finding that threshold or stability and
instability we'll do a longer for our
burn and test overnight or something
like that so we know this is good let's
open up our document that we just
created with gpu-z and I know that was
150 - OC you can see I've done this
quite a bit here so here it is this is
what it looks like you can load this
into Excel or calc or something like
that if you would like to but this is
fine for me in the first column we have
the clock scroll through here look for
the maximum number Boost 2.0 means that
it's not going to run with a number all
the time you can force it to run at the
number all the time but it's not great
for the GPU and will be worse on
stability because I won't be able to
throttle back when it wants to recover
an unstable clock so here we have 14 or
9.6 now you'll notice that is actually
lower than what what precision tells us
we have I don't know why that's not
showing up that should say 150 as you
know so if we we click here we'll see
down below that at our 150 number we
should be in the range of 12 78
megahertz for the GPU clock which means
boost will be slightly above that
1409 is actually going to be above what
our advertised boost is but that's okay
because that's how this works
so we know this is stable now we can
increase more we'll go back to precision
and at this point we're just going to
look for an unstable number without
touching voltage and I want to do it
within reason so that we can throttle
back so let's jump up to 200 megahertz
I'm going to go ahead and increase the
memory clock at this point 200 megahertz
as well
we're leaving power target at 110
percent and now when I test 3dmark just
to trigger instability I'm running it
with extreme we are going to see if this
is unstable or not so new file 200 - OC
run 3d mark and this will run if it's
not stable it'll crash it'll do
flickering anything like that and then
we need to start playing with voltage or
throttle back the clock over talking
Maxwell is very easy
you basically just change your power
percent target number and you change the
clocks as necessary and then you
increase voltage in small steps and only
about 6 millivolts at a time to sustain
stability of the GPU and in doing so
you'll eventually hit a wall because
Maxwell only has so much power to
provide in this case 225 watts max to
the clock and to the voltage so between
those two things you've got to really
push the clock as high as possible
before messing with the voltage because
increasing voltage will eat into our
power allowance or power budget which we
want to reserve for the actual clock
rate because that's what we're trying to
increase so you need to do all this
incrementally keep voltage as low as
possible generally six to 12 millivolts
at a time if you know that it's very
unstable you can probably push 12 and
then rerun the tests see if it crashes
or not this looks like it's actually
stable so far but we'll see see if that
holds out
okay so I cut a head what you just saw
was a red flash and then a black flash I
consider that unstable that is not okay
in my opinion because that means that
the GPU is starting to lose its ability
to perform stabili and it's just it's
eventually going to crash or cause other
problems so we saw some flashing that
means it's time to start playing with
other numbers here this precision
version seems to I think it's an issue
with with recording where we're seeing
some of this text disappear so at 200
megahertz were having issues now in my
log file I logged that I was able to do
at two hundred thirty megahertz
overclocked with a power of 23 percent
and over voltage of 12 you will need to
step up incremental e to get these
numbers and figure it out so if I
increase it six it might sustain the
voltage
maybe we can increase this a little bit
but we'll leave it at 110 for now hit
apply because you only want to change
one thing at a time and then read
benchmark it I already know what's going
to happen for this it will still it will
be a bit better it'll be more stable but
still have some instability on occasion
so at this point what I would do is
increase the power percent one to 115
and hit apply and and then consider
increasing the voltage depending on the
results of this now once you start
hitting this state it's good to increase
these numbers a small bit at a time so
I'll increase this to thirty I know that
I had my memory at 211 we can really
that was just kind of a random number we
can do 225 and then we'll test this
number you'll test it and maybe it's
stable if it's stable great push it
another 10 megahertz 15 megahertz once
you find instability increase the
voltage a little bit if it's still
unstable
increase the power target a little bit
and then voltage a tiny bit more you
probably don't want to go too high in
the voltage and remember you only have
one point two five six we can see here
I'm getting instability red flashes
immediately I'm going to catch
this test I already know it's not going
to work and increase the voltage in this
case so I'm going to go back over to
precision increase the voltage plus plus
12 hit apply we'll test it again and at
this point if it's not stable we can
play more with voltage more power target
at some point in your overclocking
process you will hit a stage where it is
no longer possible to just increase
voltage or power in order to sustain
that overclock that is your wall that's
as high as you're going to go this is
the point where you want to throttle
back a tiny bit to a point where it is
stable bench market log your numbers and
then go back to a modern overclock we
can see here I'm still getting red
flashes so at this point what I would
probably do is increase the power
percent 125 just to make sure there's
enough power for the clock and for the
over voltage that I am currently
applying and then I will increase the
voltage to plus 18 we can we should
probably stop there and test because
we've already changed enough at this
point each time you change something
you're going to want to start gpu-z
again and log the file log the
temperatures you can average them if you
want I have a guide on that and just
make sure you know what you're looking
at I'm being a bit quick here because
it's it's tutorial so you can see I'm
still unstable we're running into issues
where we need to figure out what the
problem is and in this case it's
probably a mix of the clocks being high
and the voltage not being high enough so
we just keep increasing and keep
increasing eventually we find a stable
rate and I have all those logs here
because I've done this so my highest
stable overclock was really to 85 which
produced a fifteen thirty seven point
seven boost clock logs through gpu-z
with a memory overclock of 325 percent
power 18 millivolts over voltage and I
it's not logged here but I forced the
fan speed
75% to make sure it was cooling properly
which is probably part of our issue here
today so you just need to incrementally
step up you'll eventually find a
comfortable overclock and all that's
detailed in my guide please let me know
if you have any questions whatsoever
that is how to overclock Maxwell just do
small steps and once you find a moderate
number in my instance here 295 was my
max 285 was my most stable max I would
probably throttle back to 250 or 230
potentially even less maybe 200 maybe 1
180 and leave it at about 180 megahertz
in my case for my GPU with the power at
115 percent and that will preserve your
GPUs endurance without really losing too
much performance so do be careful with
this it is possible to cause damage your
GPU let me know if you have any
questions whatsoever and I will see you
all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
