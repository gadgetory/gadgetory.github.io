hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at the most
expensive and largest motherboard I've
ever done on PCB breakdown of say hello
to the asus rog x5 ninety-nine dominus
motherboard this thing is designed for
overclocking the LGA 36:47 xeon w31 75 X
if you're wondering why I'm trying to
talk so fast
basically Steve told me I need to make
the video shorter the first take was
like 37 minutes before that this video
is brought to you by be quiet and it's
straight power 11 series power supplies
the straight power 11 PSU is shipped
from 450 Watts up to a thousand Watts
accommodating most of the gaming PC
build requirements you'd encounter and
focuses on delivering a higher quality
power supply that doesn't sacrifice on
efficiency or stability noise is also a
heavy point for the straight power 11
using a 135 millimeters silent wins 3
fan that can spin as low as 200 rpm for
quieter low load operation learn more at
the link in the description below anyway
let's get right into it because there's
so much stuff to cover on this
motherboard before we get into the V RMS
we're just gonna start off with some of
the features and of course the power
connectors we've got a load of power
connectors almost made this video what
advertiser unfriendly anyway so we have
a ton of freaking power connectors and
we also have a split 12 volt power plane
you can just about see how the 12 volt
power plane ends right there and the
reasoning for this is rather simple and
it's also part of the reasoning why we
have these extra six pins here so also
the motherboard has dual 24-pin power
connectors so the reason that we have
this split 12 volt power plane up and up
on the top edge and the dual 24 pins is
very very simple this powers uh this
motherboard is designed to work with
dual PSU setups and that's why we have
not you know one or two or three eight
pins now we have four eight pin power
connectors and the issue with having
four eight pin power connectors right
like one two three four so the issue
with doing that is that most high-end
PSU is even like 1600 watt power
supplies which I have to of they only
come with like two eight pin power
connectors each so essentially you
wouldn't be able to hook up like four
eight pins on to this motherboard at the
same time now if you do have a 1600 watt
power supply I would argue you
shouldn't bother with the aprons like
that's kind of the reason why we have
the extra six pin power connector is
here because essentially what you would
want to do if you had a 1600 watt power
supply is just plug that in plug that in
plug this in and plug this in and you're
sorted you don't have to worry about it
now admittedly at that point you'd
probably want to throw another PSU in
the system for powering like your GPUs
depending on how many GPUs you have or
how power-hungry said GPUs are and how
much you're overclocking the CPU but a
single 1600 watt PSU might actually be
like if you're on water cooling you're
probably not going to be able to cool
the CPU if it's pulling much more than
like 800 watts that tends to be actually
really really freaking difficult anyway
uh so actually not even 800 watts like
good luck cooling over 600 because this
is this is one big monolithic very hot
die that this Xeon comes with so anyway
so we have the the six pins for people
who want to run single PSU but if you
want to run dual PSU then you can plug
in you know to eight pins over here and
two eye pins over there and you know
each of those eight pins will be coming
like those eight pins will be coming
from the different power supplies and so
you need to split the 12 volt power
plane here because if you have two
different power supplies you're not
necessarily guaranteed that they're both
outputting exactly the same 12 volts
depending on what kind of load each is
under and if you had them on the same
power plane you'd basically end up with
one PSU feeding current back into the
other PSU and I can lead to all kinds of
issues so you can't actually have two
different power supplies on the same
like outputting power into the same
power plane basically they'll end up
fighting each other and so that's not an
option so the end result here is that we
do have that split 12-volt power plane
so if you do want to run PSU you know to
PSU setup you'd have liked to have PSU
one and then PSU to over here right on
this side now I I wouldn't necessarily
say that's a requirement like personally
I would say it would be easier to just
set up like one power supply for the CPU
and then another power supply for the
rest of the system but you you have a
lot of options also you don't actually
like even if you're on ambient cooling
as I said if you're on water cooling
like good luck cooling much more than
600 or 800 watts coming off of a
monolithic die like on this Aeon
especially considering that this thing
comes with thermal paste it's not
soldered so for most applications I
don't think you'd actually need to apply
more than just like you know say like
this 8 pin and that a pin like that
wouldn't realistically probably be about
the limit of most what most people's
cooling system would be able to handle
in this configuration now as soon as
you're looking at like chilled water
then yeah you know you'd want like a
1600 watt power supply just for the CPU
and hook it up like that
but it is worth noting like worth
keeping in mind that Durbar actually did
an L n to overclocking video with Dan
comp on this motherboard with the Xeon
and they ended up topping out at like
twelve hundred and twenty-five Watts so
it really like and that that's like
coming into the VR M that's not output
so you really like the thing is so damn
hard to cool that I honestly don't think
this huge array of power connectors is
anywhere near necessary especially
considering that like an eight pin CPU
power connector can easily handle 400
watts plus and if you have the sort of
the high current version of that power
connector and also a PSU using 16 gauge
cabling for all of its you know main
power lines then actually this connector
can handle as much as 600 watts quite
easily because it can do 13 amps per pin
pair and the same goes for the like for
the extra six pins on the side right so
you basically have like a 600 watt
connector there and these are like just
under 400 watts or something like that
so you have like 2,000 watts worth of
power connectors here if you have the
high current like you know variant of
the eight pin and the six pin on your
power supply because some power supplies
while most power supplies tend to be
done in eighteen gauge but the high-end
ones really should be done in 16 anyway
so basically we have a ton of power
connectors that are really quite
excessive but that's kind of the the
truth like that theme of excessive
amounts of everything just holds is true
for the rest of the motherboard as we
shall soon see moving on we get a power
button a reset button we also have a
retry button so this basically forces
the system to power cycle even if it
locks up to the point that like the
reset doesn't work
retry will force the system to power
cycle the other benefit of the retry
button is that you can use it for
retraining memory settings so if there's
there's like a couple different post
codes that you can get stuck on when the
memory training is not quite right
yeah mashing the retry button can get
you through some of those they'd be
things like
like sometimes when you get into like
the final initialization postcodes you
can lock up on those retry can get you
through those sometimes then like 55 is
49 s and there's a couple other ones it
really kind of depends also on the
platform which postcodes our retrial
through and which aren't
so I'm just kind of going well I'm used
to unlike XIII 9 DZ 370 and Z 217 in
terms of what retry can go through so
anyway that's a nice feature to have and
it was pretty standard for all like
extreme overclocking oriented asus rog
motherboards below that we have the safe
boot button this is a really really
awesome button basically allows you to
get into the bios without having to wipe
all of your settings if even if your
settings are screwed up so essentially
if you're you know if you're getting a
postcode that retry button doesn't get
you through you can just hit safe boot
and it should get you into the bios and
it won't even wipe all of your settings
which is awesome because if you forget
to save profiles like i do you don't
lose there all your work every move to
clear CMOS right like so yeah that's a
really awesome button to have we do also
have the postcode which is obviously for
troubleshooting we I don't think they
have the color coded LEDs on this
motherboard so anyway not really like
the postcode makes those kind of
irrelevant even when they are present
next we have the these this dip switch
right here which is for enabling and
disabling your PCIe slots considering
that this is super like freaking high
end and like workstation oriented this
is not actually that much PCIe expansion
capability on this motherboard but yeah
so you can basically disable and enable
PCIe slots with with just the dip switch
right here which is super handy if you
have like a GPU that's in like a water
loop or under liquid nitrogen and it's
not posting and it's because of one of
the GPUs isn't working and you have
several of them well you can just fiddle
with that dip switch until the system
starts working BAM you don't even have
to worry about pulling the GP the
malfunctioning GPU out of the system
much more convenient for troubleshooting
in that sense also up here we get two
more switches we get pause and reserved
one so I'm not sure what reserved one
does for x5 99 but for most other
platforms where you'd find the switch
from ASA on ASUS motherboards it
essentially preloads a bunch of extreme
overclocking settings for you this
switch is not enabled unless you have
the ln2 mode jumper enabled
and quite frankly that like flicking the
switch on like say Izzy 270 or something
at ambient will straight-up make the
system not post it's also really not
good for the system to be running like
that in the first place so yeah that
this is very much just for extreme
overclocking then above that we have the
pause switch this will basically force
lock up the system like force lock up
the CPU essentially you can pause the
CPU which is really really neat it
doesn't pause the passage of time and
the idea behind this is essentially that
you can adjust settings on say like
benchmark loading screens so you get to
a benchmark loading screen you hit pause
and then if you have like an ro GOC
panel or some kind of other you know
direct to motherboard controller you can
adjust a bunch of settings on fleek
pause back off and benchmark runs at
different settings than what like the
first test of the benchmark Ranna which
can be useful for say like for 3d marks
especially because they have a lot of
loading screens anyway so that's those
two switches up there I think I've
covered everything in that area so
moving down down here we have the slow
mode switch essentially allows you to
force the the CPU to the lowest possible
Multipla lowest possible core ratio very
convenient for basically avoiding
crashes while you're sitting idle like
you know if you're on desktop and like
messing around with files or setting
something up while on liquid nitrogen
this is a great way to both save liquid
nitrogen because power consumption is
roughly linear with your CPU frequency
and also it avoids stability issues
because you won't have to be like taking
it like you wouldn't have to save a
screenshot at 6 gigahertz right you can
take your screenshot hit slow mode save
it like point eight gigahertz so that's
a pretty nice switch to have for extreme
overclockers that also only enables once
you have ln2 mode enabled ln2 mode it
enables a bunch of the switches on the
bottom motherboard it also what it does
is it presets some voltages for extreme
overclocking and it and it lifts a whole
bunch of voltage restriction so normally
ASUS motherboards won't let you go to
like stupid voltage levels unless you
have this enabled once you have this
enabled you can burn the CPU and the
motherboard won't like won't do anything
to stop you from doing that so yeah
that's that's pretty neat next to that
we have a six pin power connector this
is just for adding extra power into the
PCIe
Lotte's this I would assume has to be on
whichever PSU is hooked up to this 24
pin because normally the way this is
implemented is it's actually in parallel
with the 12-volt pins of the 24 pin so
yeah and it's nice to see ace is finally
using a six pin for this because
normally they use a molex and I hate the
molex connector so yeah nice to see that
they are using a six pin for this at
this point and the idea is basically if
you're running a like a 4 Way GPU setup
God forbid like let's say you you run
like 4 Way Rx for a TS reference Rx for
80s right they pull a lot of power from
the PCIe slot yeah you run four of those
you're gonna melt your 24 pin and the
dual 24 pins again same reason why as
for why you have a split 12 volt power
plane up there these can't be in
parallel in terms of feeding power into
the motherboard so you do need a
separate power extra power connector to
feed the PCIe slots extra which would
have to come from the PSU which is all
in the primary 24 pin anyway so if you
had like rx for 80s or something then
they could easily pull say 300 Watts
through the PCIe slots and at that point
your 24 pins gonna melt because there's
exactly two 12-volt pins in that 24 pin
power connector and well you know 12
times 10 you know per pain is like 240
watts and you're trying to pull 300 not
gonna happen so yeah that's that's
essentially why there's this power
connector and you see that on quite a
few high-end motherboards these days as
well so pretty standard feature anyway
moving on we have a BIOS which this
motherboard has dual BIOS which is super
convenient if you break one of the by uh
one of the BIOS chips and then you still
have a working motherboard because
there's a backup BIOS chip that still
works then we have a reserve it's to
switch I have no idea what that one does
I've never actually had an asus
motherboard that has a second reserved
switch I've only had motherboards with
one I assume it adds more settings on
top of what the first one does that that
would be my guess as to how that
functions and that kind of covers
everything except for the 10 Giga quanta
land that is located right over here so
at this point we've covered all of the
features now we can move on to the V RMS
and let's start with the biggest one and
most important one which is actually not
this entire row up here because the
memory of erm
this set of DIMM slots is actually
hiding in that so this right here is VDD
R so we have V DD R over there and that
feeds this set of DIMM slots this is a
the m dot two riser card thing so that's
four m dot two SSDs that's not an extra
dims law and ace is called calls it
dimmed all two because they basically
reaper first a I think it's a ddr force
law and then they've like flipped it
around and put that over it so that you
can't and Snell install a dim in it
because it's really just meant to be a
riser card for M not to SSDs
so anyways over there we have our VDD R
then we of course have our VCC NV r M
which is freaking huge which has a lot
of power stages but not quite that many
phases then we have V DDR over here as
well because of course you do cuz like
you're not gonna be pushing power like
that that's that's just dumb so normally
you always have like basically a v RM on
either side of the cpu if there's
separate you know if you have memory
memory slots on either side of the the
cpu socket then you have V RMS on either
side as well so that's our other VDD our
v RM over there and then down here we
have what I can only assume our VCC IO
and VCC sa the only issue is I'm not
sure which ones which cuz I well I don't
have the board in hand to check so VCC
IO and VCC sa it doesn't really matter
that much both of these are rather minor
rails and they don't like they don't
push much power and more importantly
these two things like these two phases
are identical so it doesn't really
matter which ones which it's just kind
of like yeah but because they're the
spec on them is the same and they both
don't really have to do much work anyway
so let's get into the details of the VCC
and vrm here and as you can clearly see
it's freaking massive so we're not going
to be counting how many phases are in it
because I mean how many inductors are in
it because we'd be here all day but we
will split it up into the into the phase
groups here so that's 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1
2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 yes and another 1
2 3 4
and another one two three four there and
essentially you can see that we have one
two three four five six seven eight
yes this motherboard has 32 power stages
in its VCC nbrm and eight phases yeah
Asus really freaking hates doublers
that's that's basically the design
philosophy behind this vrm but so you
have a tote like it's a it's a real
eight phase but you basically have a
whole bunch of power stages in parallel
in each phase and the funny thing is is
actually at this point what asus is
doing with this VRM it's like I was
actually wondering like when when I did
my efficiency calculations I was
actually wondering why they didn't go
for only 24 power stages because if
you're not gonna use a doubler there's
nothing actually stopping you from
putting three-phase I like putting three
power stages in one phase normally if
you're using a doubler then it's like
well it doubles okay and you can't by
Tripler x' as far as I'm aware nobody
makes those but they do make quadruped
lers and you can cascade doublers into
other doublers which would give you a
quadruple err made up of three different
composers could have gone for like a
more reasonable power stage count is
we're about to find out but uh now they
like the thing is this motherboard is
$1,800 so even those like these power
stages are like four dollars each it
doesn't really make a big difference to
the total cost of the motherboard
there's like a hundred and fifty dollars
worth of power stages here but the board
is like eighteen hundred dollars like
who cares and you can see a similar kind
of thing going on with the actual
voltage controller selection because
this chip right here well that's that's
four VCC in and that's an asp 1405 so in
which the suspicion is that that is a
rebrand of the IR three five two zero
one because it behaves alike it seems to
behave a lot like an IR three five two
zero one anyway and Asus has rebranded
voltage controllers for ages but
normally you don't see a SP forty no
fives used for like memory of things
like memory power especially considering
that if I remember correctly
IR makes a three five two zero four
which is basically a three five two zero
one in terms of like features except
with less phases so it's
cheaper except this motherboard is
$1,800 so why would you bother with
buying and cheaper voltage regulator
when you can just use another ASP 1405
so that's what's going on here and
that's only running one two three phases
so the this one's running like the one
up here is running eight plus zero this
one down here is running three plus a
zero this one over here right there
that's another three plus a zero so
that's another ASP 1405 and even the VCC
i/o and VCC sa yeah you guessed it it's
another ASP 1405 because just it's
easier to use the same chip everywhere
and it doesn't like you don't need to
bother with saving money on an $1,800
motherboard it's ridiculously expensive
anyway like who cares if the chip is a
dollar more expensive at this point so
yeah that's another ASP 1405 1405 and
that one's running in 1+1 mode which is
just like a complete waste because you
can really you can buy like a three
phase or four phase controller from IR
that would do that just fine and have
like this exact same performance metrics
as a 3-5-2 like as a SP 1405 except it
wouldn't be a you know quite as
expensive or quite as large it would
take up less boards they like basically
Asus was like well the board's huge it's
expensive who cares about you know being
even remotely cost efficient at this
point and the same kind of applies to
the situation with the ridiculous number
of power stages in the v RM because the
end result of this monstrosity of a vrm
is that for the standard sort of so but
like let's finally take a look at the v
RM efficiency here right so for 1.8
volts output 602 kilohertz switching
frequency and 5 volts Drive because
these are well we're gonna get to that 5
volts Drive so that's that's the V R I'm
operating setup so that's one point
eight volts out and that's one point
eight volts because this is VCC in so
that goes into the integrated voltage
regulator on the CPU which is basically
a very very very fast buck converter
built directly into the chip and that's
a really cool feature that Intel has for
like reducing the amount of current a
motherboard has to supply to the CPU and
it's super useful in server applications
and laptop
applications and just all over the place
and they also don't use it on LGA 1151
but anyway so well those are going to be
our operating parameters for the vrm
because these chips right here are none
other these guys right here are none
other than the TDA two one four seven
two this is one of the most expensive 70
amp 70 M smart power stages you can buy
and Asus decided that they really really
really needed 32 of them in the VCC and
vrm like they didn't but they they just
kind of went with it so and these are
actually expect to just run off of
straight 5 volts all the time and that
this is just what their spec it out in
the datasheet so that that's really
convenient for me because it makes the
math really easy
yeah 70 M smart power stages they're
called smart power stages because they
integrate current monitoring temperature
monitoring over current protection over
temperature protection high side MOSFET
failure protection like there's a whole
bunch of protection modes built into
these that makes them really awesome in
that they should like if they fail on
the off chance that they fail cuz
they're ridiculously powerful but you
know let's say they do fail for some
reason or another they actually have
built-in mechanisms to protect against
like blowing up everything after the vrm
which can actually happen with like
discrete MOSFETs if they fail close and
there's nothing to to force the low side
MOSFET to basically try pull the the
high side MOSFET down because anyway I'm
getting off track here because we don't
have enough time the other feature that
these integrate being made by
international rectifier they do
integrate body braking mode which is
basically a load to idle transient
response optimizations feature which
essentially disables the low side MOSFET
well you stop using the low side MOSFET
of the power stage when you're coming
out of load into idle and the idea is
that basically that forces all of the
current going through the phase to go
through the body diode of the MOSFET and
hence the name body braking mode and the
body diode has a whole bunch of voltage
drop so you can burn off all the extra
energy stuff that's sitting in the phase
that would otherwise cause a voltage
spike as you come out of load
yeah you can burn that off and you get a
better transient better transient
response coming out of load so when you
go from like you know high current
output to low current output you don't
get as much of a voltage spike because
of body breaking mode so that's a pretty
cool feature that these integrate which
is actually like that's not a standard
feature for smart power stages that
that's just something like international
rectifier ads though there are like
inter cell has that as well they can
also do it they they just have different
different names for this so anyway let's
talk about the vrm efficiency here and
it's ridiculous because so for
convenience sake 270 watts which is a
little bit above the stock TDP of the
Zeon that goes into it which is like 255
255 watts but I was lazy and I wanted to
go with 150 amps so 150 amps current
output this vrm is going to produce
about 19 watts of heat you don't need a
heatsink at all like this doesn't need a
VR I mean heatsink whatsoever if you're
running that is the on at stock it's
just completely irrelevant like this
like there's so much surface area in
this vrm that you just don't need a
heatsink so that's awesome now moving up
into the higher current levels right 540
watts power consumption 300 amps and
this is likely what like the this is
pretty hard to cool like that's actually
really hard to cool it with like a water
cooling loop so 300 amps output for the
VR I'm at that point you're still only
gonna be looking at about 35 watts of
heat I honestly wouldn't be surprised if
the VR almost perfectly capable of
dissipating that by just existing as in
you don't need a heatsink on it and
maybe a gentle breeze would be enough um
so yeah this VR M is just ridiculous
freakin overkill moving up higher in
terms of power consumption 810 watts 450
amps I did go in steps of 150 just
because it doesn't like it doesn't
really matter I'm not sure how high you
can push it but anyway so 810 watts 450
amps you'd be looking at only about 48
watts of heat at that point having a
heatsink might be a good idea but air
flow
would be still I consider optional
uh-huh because yeah this is just
ridiculous there's so many damn power
stages in this anyway going yeah further
still with our power consumption a
thousand and eighty watts okay 600 amps
output on this VR I'm you'd be looking
at about 61 watts of heat overkill
massive freakin overkill because the
board's $1,800 so it doesn't matter if
we blow like like this vrm probably
costs like two on like is like two
hundred dollars in parts maybe maybe
more than that like definitely in just
power stages you're looking at over a
hundred dollars because each of those
TDA to 104 seventy two S's four bucks so
you're looking at like 128 dollars worth
of power stages and then you have to
also factor in the inductors which I'm
not sure what what Asus is going for
those we have 10 to them like the output
filtering capacitors right here those
are actually tantalum those are rather
expensive generally and then you have
more of them on the back of the board as
you can clearly see right here and then
if we go back to the front of the board
like this vrm is just yeah this is
ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous
and very expensive but ultimately it
doesn't like still even if this vrm is
like a hundred and eighty dollars to
build it's only 10% of the total price
of the motherboard right whereas a lot
of other motherboards say for like X 299
or or other like less ridiculous
platforms like this the vrm would
actually be a much more significant
percentage of the total cost of the
motherboard and here is just like well
who cares it's not it like even if it's
a hundred and eighty dollars worth of
components for the VR I'm ten percent of
the motherboards total cost actually 10
percent of the motherboards retail cost
which for a lot of other boards it's
much much higher than that so yeah
anyway moving on to a thirteen and I'm
on the wrong layer moving on to thirteen
hundred and fifty watts which is
actually like higher than so far any
like I've not heard of this this CPU
pulling more like that amount of power
yet okay der Bauer as I said earlier
they did Durbar and
did a ln2 overclocking session with this
motherboard and they topped out around
two hundred twelve hundred and
twenty-five watts that was going into
the vrm so not even coming out of which
basically tells us that you know if two
hundred twelve hundred twenty five watts
was going in then we were probably
looking at uh something around like
eleven hundred and fifty ish watts
coming out of the vrm and yes at that
point you would actually want like a
heatsink and some air flow but you're on
liquid nitrogen so the board is very
likely freezing over in this area anyway
at least until the CPU starts running
because that's gonna very quickly just
that that's like one massive heater
right there so yeah absolutely
like ridiculous vrm on this board and it
is only eight phases which I guess Asus
is just like we hate doublers for some
reason which I mean sure I guess like
this is still an eight phase-- and if
you set the switching frequency high
enough then you know your output ripples
definitely going to be fine also output
ripple is really dependent on how you
actually set up your output filtering
the system though your input ripple on
this thing is like it would be kind of
terrifying honestly cuz the thing you
have to understand is like if you have
say 600 amps going through this VR M
which is kind of an inconvenient work
number to work with but let's say so you
have like 400 amps 400 amps going
through this VR M right if any like one
phase turns on that's essentially a 50
amp current spike on the like for the
PSU well I mean it's gonna be you know
clean well it is gonna be suppressed by
all of these capacitors right here but
that's still like there there's a real
like doublers would actually reduce the
the input ripples quite significantly as
well and you can can you can compensate
for that with just more capacitors right
and this board certainly doesn't have a
shortage of those but uh yeah you know
it's just kind of interesting that asus
is going with this design decision to
just don't use doublers basically at all
anywhere and but here i don't really see
a problem with that because this is
still an eight phase-- and so you almost
have
full overlap well actually a 1.8 volts
output this would technically have
almost full overlap between phases as in
like this phase will stop like this
phase would turn off right as this phase
is actually turning on so your actual
like it wouldn't be like if you had a
lower output voltage and your duty
cycles were really short then you'd
actually end up with something that
looks like this on the 12-volt side but
since the duty cycle is rather long for
1.8 volts output you're gonna be looking
at something that looks more like this
right and that's actually like that's
pretty smooth so you'd actually not have
that much ripple on the input anyway but
yeah this still crazy freaking 8 phase
right here but it is still just an 8
it's definitely not a 32 but I don't
really see a problem with this it's just
kind of interesting that this is how
Asus likes designed their boards these
days especially considering that they've
used a lot of doublers in the past
anyway moving on to the memory VRMs I
mean like the V corvy CCN was ridiculous
overkill V DD R is more of the same
first of all it's three phase memory
power for our you know six DIMM slots
per per side of per side of motherboard
I am not sure what memory topology this
board uses I'm gonna guess its T
topology just because that would make
the most sense for supporting very high
memory densities whereas daisy-chain
would technically overclock better as
long as you didn't populate all the
Dames but this is a workstation platform
you're probably gonna like on the off
chance that you're buying this you're
probably going to want to populate all
the Dames for whatever you know
applicate work application you actually
have this is a stupid platform for
playing games on because a 9,900 K is
actually probably better at playing
games
then this Xeon will ever be just because
the zeona has mesh and the 9900 K has a
ring architecture connecting all of the
course well anyway so V ddr3 phase and
guess what more TD a 2 1 4 7 2 s so yeah
this is well like 79 power stages you
know 3 370 m power stages from powering
the freaking ddr4 because ddr4 really
needs a peak current at like a well it's
not actually gonna handle 210 amps just
because it would produce way too much
heat at that point but you get the idea
like this is stupid amounts of overkill
from
marine power and there's two of those
because again you do need two for each
side of the motherboard BCCI io and VCC
si are like the only two voltage
regulators on this motherboard that are
like even remotely sensible but again
not because the asp 1405 here is just
like they make cheaper controllers than
this if you're not going to need like if
you don't need more than two phases why
on earth would you use an eight phase--
controller but anyway VC C IO and VCC si
are just the Asus standard of the IR
35:53 so the this these aren't smart
power stages they are power IR stages so
they're kind of like power smart power
stages they're like almost there but
they're not quite because the smart
power stage spec is like a new thing
from Intel that came out like recent
relatively recently which is why also
all of the data sheets are spectat 1.8
volts cuz it's really like design like
these the smart power stages are
basically designed for Intel server
platforms that's where the specification
comes from it's basically from Intel but
these are just 35 55
Pawel which they are pal high AR and
that's the marketing name stages and
they integrate basically everything a
smart power stage does except not all of
the protection features so they have
over they have current monitoring
temperature monitoring body braking mode
but they as far as I know they lack over
temperature and overcurrent protection
or they're implemented slightly
differently and the current monitoring
that they have is not quite as accurate
as the smart power stages so yeah I
think at this point I've covered
everything and this video is still over
30 minutes long so that is it for the
asus rog dominus motherboard it's insane
it's huge it's $1,800 and I mean you
know you can't say Asus cut any corners
like there really is no corner cutting
because at this point it was just like
just just use whatever just how many how
many power stages do we need in our
eight phase just however many fit across
the board like if the board was any
larger I wouldn't be surprised if they
had five you know power stages in each
phase it's like why not I still wouldn't
really make a difference to the price
point the the board's meant for a three
thousand
dollar CPU so yeah absolutely freaking
insane motherboard like just III don't
have words to describe just how
ridiculous this thing is and yeah so
