of this video to be filled with the
usual comments about error versus liquid
but remember that there are use cases
for each and that it's always a matter
of making sure that you're not crossing
over into the other cooling medium by
under or over spending for this piece
we're focusing on rounding up the best
liquid coolers that we've tested this
year well look at air coolers separately
but this one focuses on just the
closed-loop liquid coolers because a lot
of people are looking around for these
types of guides right now for links to
each of the discussed products check the
description below or you can also find
our initial reviews for the coolers this
coverage is brought to you by ifixit.com
and their protec toolkit I fix it as
refreshing their protec toolkit in time
for the holidays you can find a link in
the description below to the protec
toolkit and other toolkits that iFixit
sells we find the protec and essentials
kits to be the most useful for DIY
enthusiasts so as usual for this roundup
we're looking at all the stuff we've
tested this year and only the stuff
we've tested this year if a liquid
cooler isn't mentioned or listed that
you know about it's very possible that
we simply didn't test it the goal of
this content is to go over the best
liquid coolers of the year and that
means we're only going over things we've
actually tested so things that we
haven't tested aren't going to be listed
of which would instantly answer any
questions as to why X cooler isn't
mentioned if you had that question also
air coolers will get their own content
piece later we are currently focusing on
liquid cooler is because we've tested a
lot of them over the past year and it
makes it easier to just kind of put it
all in one content piece and categorize
them for different performance metrics
one of them being most modular for
example best noise levels most
serviceable isn't it just one
interesting one best flat out thermals
best noise to performance and we do as
usual have the dumbest to trend category
at the very end the first one is for
best flat out thermals or what you might
call an award for best out-of-the-box
thermals for this one we're ignoring the
noise argument completely and just
looking at a baseline of raw thermal
performance when maxed out both the
Corsair h 115 IV 2 and EVGA CLC 280
ranked within margin of error from one
another
this functionally
for the top of the chart these are 280
millimeter solutions which we think
provide an ideal mix of compatibility
and noise the thermal performance and
when min maxing for each metric the 280s
work out pretty well in most cases 280
millimeter coolers are an extra 10 to 20
dollars over the 240 millimeter
counterparts and the additional thermal
Headroom means that fans can be slowed
down in turn this achieves similar
thermal performance to 40 solutions but
with lower noise levels as for the
highest raw performance though the
Corsair and EVGA 280 millimeter
solutions both take half of the crown as
again they're within margin of error
from one another each unit uses an ASA
tech Gen 5 pump with the 2-time for
price at one hundred and ten dollars on
sale this week or typically around 130
regardless of the sale prices EVGA and
Corsair seem to constantly match one
another so the choice will primarily
come down to what you think of the block
design internally they're mostly the
same in this case it's the outside that
counts both units have RGB LEDs and
those are behind the logo plates and
both have their own software solution
that you can hook in to strictly looking
at the out of the box fan configurations
though because aftermarket fans would
basically equalize all of these the next
crown is for best noise to performance
ratio for peak noise normalized
performance at 40 decibels thus far the
testing puts the Kraken X 62 at the top
of the charts we haven't tested as many
coolers with this newer method
introduced only a couple months ago but
so far the stack up of popular coolers
puts NZXT srgb heavy cooler up top the
Kraken X 62 also happens to be one of
the most expensive coolers on the market
it is sometimes difficult to get a hold
of outside of the NCHC store and
typically runs around 150 to 160 dollars
fortunately other nearby coolers
including 360 millimetre units can
compete in price and performance in
terms of noise normalized performance
with the kraken x 62 if RGB isn't your
thing this next one is for most
serviceable and is assigned for the
easiest cooler to take apart and
maintain over a long service life and
uptime animatics was first to market
with an actually good liquid cooler for
thread Ripper on which we found highly
competitive in noise analyze performance
including vs. nearby air coolers
it's also trivial to dismantle and
maintain which is pretty much impossible
to say for almost every other liquid
cooler that's made by A's attack the
company nearly deserves its own award
category for being brave enough to
actually invest in a small market
segment like thread Ripper because it's
paying off when considering the
performance uplift granted by a
full-coverage cold plate the libtech TRS
strips a select performs significantly
and opening the unit only reveals more
of why that is the cooler spans it's
micro fins nearly across the entire area
of the cold blades leveraging the native
service area of thread Ripper for
cooling benefit but the serviceability
of the cooler gives it an important
award in our teardown we show how easy
it would be to maintain the lift tech
tr4 in the future permeation will be
less of a concern as the easy access
ports make refilling a non-issue if it's
ever used beyond at the four to five
year mark you've got the ability to
refill the liquid with standard
distilled water or some kind of mixture
propylene glycol of you are choosing
lock design and assembly are also
surprisingly high quality making the
leak tech units the only coolers we're
strongly recommending for threader for
outside of the usual Noctua air Nhu 14s
for most a modular we have the Alpha
cool ice bear 420 this is an odd unit
it's for a few reasons to thermally the
ice bear performs worse than many of its
smaller cheaper peers which is entirely
due to its stock ice wind fans or at
least mostly due to that the fans are
noise focused and limited in performance
leaving us wanting in a lot of ways
replacing the fans helps a bit though
you can potentially become bottle necked
on the pump with a radiator this large
as well and still the unit can hook into
prefilled alpha cool blocks like the ice
wolf that we previously reviewed and
therefore gives users what amounts to a
cheaper semi open loop that is highly
modular the market is small for this
setup as venturing into modularity
quickly enters territory of open loop
markets but there is still a market for
quick disconnect the ice wolf blocks can
cool reference GTX 10 series cards have
integrated pumps to ensure that the four
20s pumps doesn't limit performance and
they are also prefilled
we weren't big fans of the quick
disconnect valves but they get the job
done
just be careful to unscrew the correct
end of the valve and read the
instructions thoroughly in terms of
modularity short of going with an ek
fluid gaming beginners open-loop kit the
Alpha cool options provide full copper
solutions worth considering for niche
markets we do recommend replacing the
fans though the next one is for best
noise levels overall this one goes to a
cooler that's been retired sadly though
it didn't deserve it and it's been
replaced with other lines we give this
one to the ek predator 2 ATX LC cooler
which managed to remain operable and
within temperature spec at just 600 rpm
on the fans while putting out 29.2 DBA
for its noise level that's only 3 DBA
over our noise floor of 26 temperatures
our were around 49 degrees Celsius delta
T over ambient for this cooler so
nearing 70 C if you factor in ambience
and it remained nearly completely silent
and operable under full ABX workloads
but also again the only real noise
coming out of the system at this point
is from other fans like the power supply
the GPU case fans things like that we
were all so impressed with eks quick
disconnect system as they're easily the
best of their kind when it comes to ease
of use and security the predator units
stock fans permit lower operating noise
levels a greater range of customization
and competitive stock thermals here
comes the big unfortunate part as to why
it was retired
unfortunately the cooler had good reason
to be terminated
just one scroll through the new agate
user reviews it reveals nearly 70
percent negative reviews say that 10
times fast
all of which point to leaks in the loop
so 70 percent negative it's one of the
worst scores we've seen and they're all
for catastrophic failure we still want
to call to attention that the fan and
cooler design for its silence is among
the best of the coolers we've looked at
this year it's just unfortunate that it
didn't work out
we do however hope that other CLC makers
can replicate the acoustic performance
and maybe even the QDC setup without
also replicating the destroy the entire
system performance of the cooler the
next award best overall value was
originally expected to go to the cooler
master master liquid 280 but we never
got to test it and this one coupled with
the previous one is probably going to
scare if you
away from liquid coolers the coolers
fans crews have a tolerance of fifty
point four six to fifty point six five
millimeters and because Coolermaster
routes its radiator tubes right behind
the screw hole and additionally does not
have a stopper pad like every other
cooler on the market the fifty point six
five millimeter screw punctured the tube
fortunately no damage is caused to the
test system and looking at user reviews
online it appears we weren't alone with
this problem this is a matter of zero
tolerance and zero redundancies or
safeties provided by the radiator and of
the dozens of units we've worked with
over the years this is the only one that
we've ever had this problem with so it's
a matter of not having any protection
behind these screw hole and also routing
a tube behind one which seems crazy
let's bring the overall value award
title back on the screen and give it to
something more deserving best overall
value presently goes to the EVGA CLC 240
cooler which was bitterly embattled with
the Corsair h100 ib2 well you know
overall performance versus price
including noise normalized 40 DBA
performance and flat-out performance the
EVGA CLC 240 slightly outperforms the H
100 IV to at 40 DBA and manages
otherwise similar performance the point
of differentiation here is that
presently in generally speaking EVGA has
tried to hold on to a slight price
advantage over course they're the
coolers both bounce between 85 and 110
dollars with EVGA a couple bucks cheaper
right now the trouble with value liquid
coolers as always is that you rapidly
enter territory where an air cooler
might be cheaper and equivalent in key
performance metrics so keep that in mind
as you look at the lower end liquid
coolers because as you start entering
that territory of sixty to ninety
dollars it really might be best to look
for an air cooler and finally the
dumbest trend or as we've been calling
it the best dumbest trend goes to the
fans for the year all the fans all the
fans on all of the coolers not every
single fan on every single cooler is bad
to be fair but a lot of them are the ice
wolf for example is one of the worst
fans we've worked with and it comes on
one of the really the largest
closed-loop liquid cooler on the market
it might be v largest
comes on this thing 420 millimeters you
got three of these
and they're not very good but if you
replace them there's a lot of thermal
Headroom to gain they're not alone
though alpha cool there's also the stock
fans for really everyone else EVGA is
aren't that much better in terms of
absolute raw horsepower EVGA can kind of
brute force its way to the top of the
charge just because they spin at 2500
rpm and produce like 60 decibels worth
of noise but that doesn't mean it's a
good fat just means it spins really fast
and is loud
Corsair stock fans aren't particularly
impressive either neither our NZXT T's
and overall it's just a matter of trying
to make the most affordable liquid
cooler possible that these companies can
make so they can compete with the
high-end air coolers and unfortunately a
lot of the time that means sacrificing
the fan the fan tends to be towards the
top of the list of things to get cuts
which might have to do with reliability
and making sure the pump has a long
service life doesn't have any failures
things like that but just in terms of
trends we'd like to see change even if
it increases price a few bucks fans
would probably be the top of the list
for liquid coolers so that's all for
this one as mentioned earlier we are
working on looking at a bunch of air
coolers it's a matter of having to test
them all and what systems we're gonna
use for that testing so we're working on
it we'll have an air cooler round up
separately might not be till a little
bit later but it's on the way and it
will have comparative data to the liquid
cooler so you'll be able to properly see
at what point in terms of price is there
a threshold crossover where air and
liquid basically become the same where's
the where's the threshold for that so as
always subscribe for more and make to
make sure you catch the air cooler
