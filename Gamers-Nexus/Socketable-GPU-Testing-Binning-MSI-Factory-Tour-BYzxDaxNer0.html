in Shenzhen China complements the
company's taiwan-based headquarters that
we previously toured which handles most
of the product engineering radiation EMI
and compliance testing that's done for
MSI the Shenzhen Factory meanwhile has
some unique tool like a socketable GPU
testing machine and host 15 service
Mountain Technology lines that are
responsible for manufacturing a combined
total of 2.6 million motherboards and
video cards per month this video looks
at the video card section of MSI's at
Shenzhen Factory
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components Crona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound learn more
at the link in the description below the
most interesting tool in MSI's video
card manufacturing plant was a
socketable GPU tester we only grabbed a
few quick shots of this one but the rig
is used for testing actual GPUs in the
same board to validate that the GPU
itself is good this is mostly part of
the Quality Assurance department but in
theory one could also use this tube in
GPUs before ever mounting them to a PCV
when we visited it was being used to
test individual GPUs for quality control
and to see if there was anything
defective on the GPU is coming through
that section of the factory the board is
a custom PCB made by MSI with four vrm
fan mounts directly atop the MOSFETs
inductors and the rest of the vrm the
goal is for this rigsby hot suavo and
fast to work with so exposing the card
is important technicians use hooked up
probe connectors for multimeter
measurements to ensure all the voltages
are showing with additional debug LEDs
on the board for indicating if any
specific parts of the PCB like different
VRMs are having trouble coming online
the block mounted to the PCB has pins
exposed for a GPU of all grid array or
BGA making it similar to socketable CPUs
but more difficult to align and harder
to make the top of the mechanism turns
to lock into place securing a cold plate
directly to the GPU dot this what water
cooling solution is used for ease
and reproducibility of testing as it
will fit all cards and accommodate all
GPUs with the same Z height the PCB is
swapped out in some instances like when
working with different architectures but
for the most part MSI can stick with the
same base PCB for an entire generation
tests run include function testing
frequency testing and ensuring that all
parts of the GPU are working like the
memory controller for instance GPUs that
pass validation can be sent back into
the SMT line for installation onto a
board although anything that fails is
discarded MSI says it doesn't use this
configuration to bend GPUs for the
current lightning model but a
sufficiently high end card could use
this setup for bidding the GPU before
the dies mounted to the PCB the trouble
is that once a die is mounted to the PCB
it's really not worth reclaiming it if
found to over perform or be a golden
sample this socketable solution would
allow chips to be pre sorted for
installation only on high-end cards the
cost to do such a thing is still
exorbitant time cost is high machine and
equipment occupancy is high and
technicians would get bogged down
looking for Holy Grail GPUs for this
reason a Messiah doesn't presently use
the contraption for bidding but instead
uses it for QC it could though the
product warranted such use this is
completely custom made and unfortunately
unavailable in the market but shows one
of the coolest utilities we've seen and
answers the question of what's required
to make a socketable GPU video card
testing and validation is another
interesting aspect of MSI's Factory this
area is at the end of the SMT line or
the service mount technology line which
follows mostly the same process as
gigabytes Taiwan factory that we already
showed although MSI has some additional
automation in place that wasn't at the
gigabyte plant once the video card goes
through the SMT line and is assembled it
spit out two function testing and goes
through some of the benchmarking or pre
testing of the factory this area is
configured such that a single technician
can control up to 12 computers with
video cards being fed down a conveyor
belt so that each operator can pull new
cards for his or her station
there are several stations on each side
of the floor each with its own conveyor
belt hooked up to the end of the SMT
line of which there are five total each
card is
to get checked in then plugged into one
of the pre-built test machines the test
benches are configured in such a way
that the technician only has to plug the
card in and then press a button at which
point the system takes complete control
and automatically tests itself start to
finish this is next level test
automation the system uses Windows 10
for some tests and tiny Linux 18 for
others each video output port is
individually tested on every single card
that comes off of the production line
software from Nvidia and AMD does a lot
of the testing and is largely black box
its secretive test software to the
extent that MSI's technicians actually
have no idea what Nvidia's utilities are
even doing just that
Nvidia mandates them function tests
stress each part of the GPU for
functionality hence the name and will
throw error codes if any defects are
found if an error crops up the operator
scans a barcode located on the bench
there's one barcode for each type of
error so the individual card is tagged
with its error and then put into a tape
top area for defects and sent back to
the QC team on the other side of the lab
each of these 12 systems for each
operator also does thermal testing
looking for performance within range of
the coolers acceptable variants each
cooler has a different tolerance for
variants tests include temperature range
fan speed PA state testing to ensure the
GPU hits p8 p1 and so forth and the PM
latency testing on the different
motherboards that are relevant for this
section frequency is also validated
during function testing this is where
some binning or pre-sorting comes in if
a card on a gaming X PCB tests with a
chip that has relatively low frequency
the card can instead be swapped with an
armorer cooler and sold as a
lower-priced model while still using the
same PCB so you don't have to desolder
the GPU color image our tests are also
run on each of the cards validated
against Nvidia or AMD color specs as the
card progresses through testing it is
checked further for LEDs for BIOS
flashing and is then sent down the
conveyor belt to the next station as for
manufacturing itself the steps are
identical to motherboard manufacturing
in fact the same exact lines can be used
they just have to be reconfigured
msi manufactures 1 million video cards
per month at this facility
enya factor 1/4 way
the 1.6 million motherboards per month
made in the same building MSI runs 5 VGA
lines and 10 motherboard lines with
mostly the same equipment that we saw in
our gigabyte factory tour video you can
check that video for more detail on the
step by step process but we'll show just
a few of the new pieces of equipment
here GPU loading is one of the cooler
sections where operators load entire
trays of GPUs to be slotted onto the
video card PCBs by machine the start to
finish manufacturing time for the
average video card is approximately
three to four hours from SMT to
packaging with 30 minutes of testing in
between approximately 5000 people work
at this facility but that number is cut
in half
from before automation had spread so
widely the factory operates at peak
efficiency as one of the largest sources
of motherboards and video cards in the
world alongside some factories from Asus
and gigabyte that's it for this factory
tour we'll have another piece on MSI is
a motherboard testing facility as that
uses some special machines that
automatically builds computers for
validation subscribe to catch that and
if you want to help us fund future
expensive factory tour trips like this
one please consider purchasing a GN mod
mat on store gamers nexus net the mats
are back in stock and available in four
foot by two foot large versions or 32
inch by 16 inch medium sizes perfect for
system build projects
offering wiring diagrams and screw
trackers and including proper
anti-static grounding thanks for
watching we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
