we just posted for destiny to this
content is trivial all we're doing today
is looking at the texture differences in
terms of visual quality going from the
lowest setting medium setting and
highest settings comparing what the
textures look like and that's about it
in terms of performance just to get this
out of the way now there's really no
difference if your CPU bound its texture
resolution and destiny - and pretty much
every other game is largely a video
memory item so if you have issues with
running out of video memory go to a
lower texture resolution that'll help
you out but if you're not running into
that problem then you can run with the
higher settings and we'll show you the
differences here before that this
coverage is brought to you by cable mod
already well-known for their work in
custom sleeved power supply cables cable
mod is now venturing into liquid cooler
tubes leaving with their new a i/o
sleeping kits compatible with Coursera
and NZXT as of now check the link in the
description below for more information
so this content should be pretty
straightforward we've done it for The
Witcher 3 GTA 5 and watchdogs - in the
past all we're doing is showing texture
quality comparisons we're using 4k
resolution for the game the highest
settings with MSA even though it's
undesirable for performance it gives us
the best look and changing texture
quality between those three settings
mentioned lowest medium and highest
there are two other settings as well and
one being high and one being a low so
we're skipping over those you can fill
in the blanks yourself so the first one
we're looking at is the wide view from
the single player spawn point and the
first thing seen when entering the game
most textures are too distant to really
matter here you can't really see the
difference the quilted texture of the
guardians gloves and the scratches on
her revolver do blur at the lowest
settings and shadows from a bright flash
of light make the highest screenshot
look more detailed than it actually is
we can't control lighting in this game
so keep that in mind
the real difference can be spotted on
the girder at the top center of the
screen but not a whole lot from the wide
view which is good if you need to run
the lower settings because ultimately
that'll help out with video memory
limitations like on two gigabyte cards
looking next at the control panel shot
this shows detail
lettering that is amazingly sharp at
high resolutions the game was clearly
designed with 4k TVs in mind you can
even see lettering that is still
somewhat legible at the lowest setting
though it does get a lot less legible
and the concrete textures blur a bit
here but it's the already low res
texture is it like that was on the wall
at the right that really lose all
definition when they're turned down the
leftmost Rock also loses texture detail
and is particularly noticeable between
highest and lowest next is the static
enemy shot lucky for us there are a
couple of enemies at the very beginning
of the game that are baked into the
level the chest piece and helmet show
minut paint textures differing and some
pitting as well this is still visible on
medium but is completely lost at lowest
setting so that's what you look forward
to tell the difference here the shoulder
and neck segments of the armor go from
mildly blurry to quake level textures
with visible pixelation next are the
lockers the most visible degradation
here is in the numbers but the rest is
the red and blue labels which barely
lose any fidelity at all so that's a
good thing minor details like screw
holes and chips in the metal blur but
are less noticeable than some of the
other changes we've seen and next
there's the banner this room isn't
strongly affected from the texture
change except for the banner which loses
its woven texture most clearly we can
zoom into some of that to show it the
containers like the crates and the jug
retained most of their tax rain and
sharpness for most parts are mostly
looking at differences in banner weave
and sharpness at the edges of the cross
swords here's another one this is the
gold door we're calling it this has tiny
sharp areas of transparency in the gold
seal that blur into a yellow mess at the
lowest resolution outlining everything
in yellow so you can see the differences
here pretty well not necessarily
something you'd appreciate but it's
there and the difference is primarily
just in those yellow cross hatching
designs and here's an exit sign this is
the same style of control panel as seen
earlier but the wall texture behind it
changes completely with resolution small
specks of color are smeared out and the
whole wall becomes a blue blur next is a
wall shot geometry remains crisp at any
texture resolution because as well its
primitives and geometry not textures the
edges of the pits are unchanged the
textures within blur how
this screenshot also offers a closer
look at the revolver which loses a few
barrel scuffs from the texture
resolution change the mystical crossed
swords on this robots chest thing coming
up next is crisper and smoother at the
highest settings but becomes jagged at
lower settings the dark areas of its
legs and hands lose nearly all detail as
does the metal pipe on its chin which
has a slight bumpiness at the highest
settings that's not really present at
the lowest and here's another one the
box work on it note the lettering on the
label this remains completely clear at
the highest settings but gets fuzzier as
we move through medium and the lowest
some of the smaller dents and scratches
toward the bottom of the crate become
less noticeable though and here's a
crate the fabric covering the crate has
an interesting jagged texture to it
which it blurs into a pixelated blob the
round design becomes jagged and
indistinct with the lower texture
resolution as well with the textures
overall things say not a distance in
this game don't really suffer much from
the reduction in texture resolution
especially if they're geometrically
complex you have seen that more than the
textures anyways because the geometry
adds shadow and details that don't rely
on 2d textures the amount of detail and
the highest res textures is impressive
though especially on a 4k display with
the higher end GPUs we were testing that
had sufficient memory video memory that
is we really didn't see any performance
loss with the texture change for the
most part this is again something that
would primarily impact things like a 10
52 gigabyte card maybe an rx 550
something like that that's where you'd
want to lower the text resolution but if
you can get away with it we'd recommend
keeping the higher resolution textures
for pretty much all hardware at least
with three plus gigabytes of video
memory and then consider instead
dropping things like ambient occlusion
from 3d to HD AO or drop in things like
the depth of field from the highest
settings to some of the lower settings
those will get you a lot more
performance than the texture resolution
changes well in this game and when the
game launches we're looking forward to
doing a full graphics optimization guide
just like we did years ago now with GTA
5 The Witcher we did one with watchdogs
2 and overwatch more recently there are
a lot of fun for us it's a bit
from doing the detailed hardware reviews
and we get to look at how the game's
graphics interact with the hardware talk
about what settings you should use the
best optimize for different hardware
things like that so subscribe for that
that will come out when the game
launches but for now this gives us a
good start and we've got some texture
comparisons there's a big difference and
some of them not some other ones but if
you can get away with it run with the
higher textures is the takeaway here
because the performance difference is
pretty much invisible with anything
except maybe a 2 gigabyte card which
we'll have to get around to testing that
more once the game comes out so that's
it for this one quick note here we will
be at PAX West this weekend so by the
time this video goes up we will probably
be on the way out there if you see a
stop by and say hi we'll be at the
Coolermaster booth on Friday doing a
build a live build with one of their new
cases so you'll want to see that because
I think it's gonna be some of the first
detailed coverage of of their new cases
that we showed at Computex definitely
come by and check that out it'll be I
think at 1 p.m. local time on Friday at
PAX so check that out otherwise we'll
have a video up as always subscribe for
more you can help us out directly on
patreon.com slash gamers nexus and check
out the article below for these
screenshots thank you for watching I'll
see you all next time
