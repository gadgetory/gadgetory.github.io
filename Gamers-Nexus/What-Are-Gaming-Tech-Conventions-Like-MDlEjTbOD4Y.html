together a quick and somewhat informal
video about what is it like to go to pax
especially from our perspective as media
and we go to a lot of these events so
just to kind of bring everyone up to
speed on what it is we do on almost a
daily basis at the site it's it's very
travel intensive so right now through
this first quarter of the year the
travel season is the worst for us in
terms of activity it's about every two
weeks we're going somewhere so it starts
out the year starts with CES consumer
electronics show that's in Las Vegas
even though it's in Vegas we're not
doing any of the stuff that you would
expect to be done in Vegas it is
entirely work 12 to 14 hours a day
things like that so we do that show
that's about a full week and almost all
the meetings are in suites which is
fantastic because from a media
perspective it means we're not shouting
over crowds and we get very direct sort
of targeted looks at the new hardware we
can talk to the engineers and get an
idea things so that's how CES kind of
very top level works then from there
we'll normally go to pack south or some
other events in the future maybe south
by southwest from there about two weeks
later we go to another local events two
weeks later we start prepping for
depending on what time of year it is
it'll be PAX East or it'll be e cgc or
it'll be dreamhack in this instance this
year or any number of other events
including gtc and GDC how could I forget
there is so basically it's CES into GDC
there's about a 12 two-week gap so we
fly to San Jose if I back to North
Carolina and then one to two weeks later
we fly to San Francisco and do the other
show fly back to North Carolina couple
weeks later two weeks later we'll 52
Boston come back to North Carolina and
stay here for about a week and now in a
couple days will be going to Dreamhack
which is an Austin this year and that's
the first or Dreamhack after that it is
Taipei and compy tags and China trip to
see the factories so very intensive
season but let's talk about what it's
like to be at PAX East specifically so
this one is a bit of a different beast
for most these other events because it's
not really a media targeted event it's a
consumer event that's really cool
it gives us a different look at things
it means that consumers are the heart of
the show if you want to go play games
you can certainly do that as a consumer
you don't have to have a badge you don't
have to be credentialed so that makes it
different that also means that it's
about 70,000 people for the weekend and
it means that if you look at the stats
we just published from the the wireless
group at the convention center they were
seeing 15,000 concurrent users for
Saturday concurrent any one second
fifteen thousand users just on the
wireless alone and I our team that
doesn't even connect to the wireless
there so there's the plenty of people
who aren't tracked as well so you could
have upwards of 20,000 people in that
place at one time the Boston Convention
Center the bcec is a pretty nice
convention center its massive you could
probably host like a monster truck rally
in there if you wanted to it's all
indoors basically a giant exaggerated
basement and more or less it comes up
out of the ground there but so very big
there's not a lot of twists and turns
like at the PAX Prime Convention Center
in Seattle that means it's pretty easy
to get around other than the crowds go
in there you're basically fighting
crowds constantly you've got camera
equipment well that good luck because
there's no no regard for anybody when
people are trying to get to their game
to play it but in terms of the media we
tend to book medians about back to back
every 30 minutes or so i'll do some
blocks to our block we call them
editorial blocks and that's the time we
take when we say okay we know we're
talking to AMD and intel at 9am and
930am for instance let me put them back
to back so if we talk to them that time
we know there's going to be content
coming out of those meetings we know
that it's going to be fairly high
priority for our site and knowing that
we'll just say okay well let's take 10
to 12 and produce that content or
however long we think it may require
that's when Keegan will do all the video
production work i'll do the editorial
work of patrick stones with us which he
normally is he'll help me with research
or his own editorial work that's how
that works and we'll book back to back
and travel from one booth to the next
occasionally they're in meeting rooms
occasionally they're in a hotel which is
again phenomenal if they are but
normally it's in the booths and so what
happens is here just corralled into this
tight very personal space
to talk to these people it's difficult
to get any sort of is just personal
space really and so that makes it hard
to film but the harbor vendors are
always fantastic they're easy to work
with because it's a gaming show so
hardware is very important at PAX it's
got a huge presence now but certainly if
you want to say raffles notwithstanding
the MSI booth or the Canton booth it
will be less crowded than perhaps the
law breakers or the overwatch booth
that's just the nature of the show but
other than that stuff will work from me
nine eight or nine am kind of get up 7am
start working get ready go to the show
floor nine and this is the fun part that
you may not know about and you should
know about if you're gonna go to pax
east some day because of the semi recent
events in Boston a couple years ago
security since then has been very heavy
to get into the convention center and
that means that generally you should
look at about a 20 to 30 minute window
just to get inside so that's that's not
fun of course but once you get through
security in the bag check it's it's
pretty easy going will work from about
nine or ten am all the way through about
5pm I try to finish up kind of early at
the show and then we go back to the room
and we produce content for until 12 or 2
a.m. or however long it takes to get it
all done wake up for four hours later
and do it all again so that's kind of
the basics more advanced things I
suppose if you're going as a consumer I
there's all these panels they're really
cool so if you like to sort of see
industry icons or if you have very
specific things in the games industry
you're interested in whether that's
social issues in gaming or if you want
more fun things like just sort of stupid
stuff that happened during the
development of X game or you want to see
gabe and tycho of course the the Creator
is a penny arcade you want to see them
compete playing overwatch there's all
that stuff to which we don't really
cover a lot of that these days just
because it takes a lot of time the
panel's if you want to go to one I would
very strongly suggest showing up
probably if it's a popular one maybe
about an hour in advance for example the
which panels always well there is one
with alan tudyk this year who of course
is known for playing wash and Fire
I he was there that panel is one where
you want to show up an hour in advance
because they do fill up the room and you
won't get in once it's full that's just
it so definitely 30 minutes to an hour
minimum to make sure you get in bring
something this is something that I
haven't thought of in a long time
because i haven't been an attendee in a
very long time six years yes but as
media we don't think a lot of things
that attendees need to think about so
one thing as an attendee you have a lot
of downtime because you're waiting in
lines to go to panels or to go to play a
game or whatever i would suggest
bringing something like zombie dice or
some simple game you can only buy really
simple games there drop 10 or 15 bucks
and make a friend on the line play it on
the floor I've done that I did that with
magic many years ago when I was actually
waiting in lines and when I say actually
waiting in line so it's not sort of a
that's not a like look where media we
can cut the line it's not how it works
at pax so that is maybe how it works at
some conventions GDC certainly and it's
for good reason you know we've got
back-to-back meetings they got
back-to-back meetings we're both trying
to do our jobs so it makes sense but at
at pax it is still consumer targeted so
to get ahead of the line means we booked
ahead of time we booked a special
meeting show up with other media and
then we all play the game together do a
brawl and everyone goes about their
their job so it's maybe 10 to 20 minutes
to play the game or less in some cases
talk to the dubs get out of there and
write the content and that is chaotic in
many other ways because we're all
competing with each other but as an
attendee definitely keep in mind though
the line times and there's some other
pretty cool stuff here in cosplay is
cool if you do that or if you want to
take photos of it it's great place to
practice photography if you are into
tabletop games there's a lot of that
there one cool place to visit if you
ever go to pax is the bring your own
computer BYOC so they have this whole
normally intel or i buy or cybertron was
the sponsor this year they'll normally
sponsor these free to play free play
excuse me computer areas so you go stand
in line you get in you get put on a
computer you stay however long you want
or until they kick you out you can play
the games that are there you can log
into your own account play your own
games but either way there's a area next
to it called the BYOC area
you know popular Atlanta vents like
Dreamhack and you bring your system
every now and then there are some really
cool case mods and so Bob Stewart has
made some dingo he's another modder he's
made some Falcone Charlie Falcone dingo
and then rod Rosenberg which works with
Bob all these pretty well-known people
modders who do awesome case mods and
they'll bring that stuff this couple
others as well so you can walk up to the
BYOC area and say do you mind if I get
an escort to walk around and take a look
and they'll be happy to do that for you
so that is done by enforcers enforcers
only wear red or blue shirts and they
are volunteers they do it completely for
free that work six or eight hour shifts
and the exchange is basically penny
arcade says you know you work the show
for us and we'll give you free passes
and then you can play around for one or
two days or however long it may be I
don't know the exact details but those
are the enforcers they're kind of the
peacekeepers they make sure everyone
Corral's into the booth rather than
standing in the aisle but Harbor
presence has grown a lot to lately AMD
was there for the first time this year I
haven't seen them there before at PAX
East era packed South this your first
time Intel is always there Nvidia pretty
much always there this year they skipped
the show floor they did an event outside
and that's another thing to know is if
you're interested in external events
like the star citizen team almost always
does one this year they're keeping their
heads down because they're trying to
finish squadron 42 but they almost
always do an event just outside of a
convention summer pax any of them and
the same is true and video ho it's their
party twitch host their party we don't
go to these party events i I mean
certainly if anyone on my team wanted to
I would let them if they wanted to get a
break from working on content to go to
do that but personally and currently
everyone on the team we all feel the
same that it's just and I hope the
vendors if any manufacturers are
watching don't take this the wrong way
but we feel like the giant waste of time
we'd rather work on the content and then
sleep then go out to some event and not
really do anything productive now of
course there's the whole shaking hands
saying
but that's really not what we're in this
for and this to make cool content about
cool stuff so that is what we like
spending our time on but certainly you
can go to the parties if you wanted to I
think twitches with us it was at a
bowling alley this year so very quick
and formal unscripted you know this is
what pax is like from a top level
perspective if you ever go as an
attendee it is a heck of a lot of fun
but we don't really have that
perspective anymore actually been there
as media and the only main difference is
when you're there as media you're there
to to really work and it's it's hard
work if you're if you're in media and
you're maybe a smaller blog or whatever
you know we've been doing this I've been
running the site since 2008 it was a
sight before was a YouTube channel sites
still larger than the YouTube channel
and the the thing to know is you don't
just show up and expect to write one
post recapping the day you gotta write
up every single meeting you go to and
then look for cool stuff to discover
while you're there I love going to the
well I guess I don't do it so much
personally anymore because I'm managing
from a top o but if Patrick or keygen or
anyone else with us has a spare time
I'll tell them you know I got nothing
for you for the next two hours go have
fun go check out the indie mega booth if
you want to play games great enjoy
yourself but if you want to help the
site make content then certainly I'm
good with that so go explore and
discover something that's really cool
come back and we'll report on it so we
did that with majors of mr. alia we did
that with seven did that with a couple
other games than previous years and you
can find some really cool stuff down
there on the show floor that is not
necessarily known just because the
nature of being in D they don't have a
huge marketing budget so pretty cool
stuff but anyway I might do one of these
more condensed for future events
probably do one for CES or computech
certainly would be cool we'll be
checking out some of the big giant
technology models at computex or not I
computex put in Taipei and Shenzhen so
that'll be fun content but as always
patreon link commercial video if you
wanna help us out directly these efforts
are constant antics
it's very expensive I I'll just drop a
quick number we we normally will spend 3
plus grand for an event and that's
obviously as media you spend a bit less
as a consumer if you're just going alone
and maybe staying in a room with a group
of friends but from a business side
we're paying for I personally will pay
for everyone's flight or i should say
the company will pay for everyone's
flight which is owned by me but so
that's several grand just to do that
alone and then that the show itself is
getting the rooms or several grand
getting the calves a couple hundred
bucks and only for the whole thing and
food couple hundred bucks i'm paying for
the team obviously not just myself so
money is a big thing in it and probably
not something a lot of people think
about but as i said a second ago we'll
do something more in depth on that in
the future just because it's kind of
interesting discussion i think for
anyone who either trying to get into the
industry or just curious about how the
industry works behind the scenes but
thank you for watching as always
