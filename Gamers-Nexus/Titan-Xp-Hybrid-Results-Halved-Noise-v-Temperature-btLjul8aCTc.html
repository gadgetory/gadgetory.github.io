hybrid cooler which is just a CLC stuck
it on to the Titan XP and tested it to
see if the clock speeds were increased
just by removing the thermal barrier or
if we could smooth out the clocks over
time we have all that testing for you
here today thanks to it reader grant for
loaning us the card and before we get
into that this coverage is brought to
you by ifixit.com who provided the tools
used for our tear down and this mod you
can go to ifixit.com slash gamers Nexus
and use code and gamers Nexus for five
dollars off of an order $10 or more we
would recommend the pro tech tool kit
which is linked in the description below
so today's goal is to look at how this
performs against itself with the stock
cooler as it was originally sold the
unit is $1200 so the NVIDIA Titan XP
that's the new 1 2017 edition and we
ripped off the cooler because normally
with the founders edition mods if you
pull that cooler off we find that the
performance in terms of clocks versus
time and temperature improves with a
better cooling solution like this one
now you could run the vrm fan at
something like 80% and have similar
results but this helps us in a few ways
that we weren't expecting because we're
now measuring the vram temperatures
alongside the power component
temperatures which we haven't always
done for these mods so the vram
temperature in particular is new for us
we've got results on that today other
than this the mod is it's about $100
liquid cooler kit when you're spending
1,200 bucks it's kind of hard to gauge
at what point value still matters this
is not a card for gamers as we said in
our gaming review of the Titan XP you'd
be better off with something like a
1080i because when there are overclocked
or stock it's pretty much the same
performance but that's for the Titan XP
review that we already posted what we're
doing here today is just looking at how
does it perform thermally and does it
improve by changing the cooler not
necessarily looking at is it worth
buying you can check our review for that
and before getting into the test data as
always testing methodology is it linked
in the description below so we've got
the full article on this there which
will
a few extra charts not found in this
video and it's also got the methodology
including how we're using thermocouples
to measure different temperature of
temperatures of components on the card
so you can check that link for more
information on all of that let's start
with an easy chart this one is frequency
versus time showing the performance of
the Titan XP stock versus our hybrid mod
and the tremendous frequency difference
here not like we've seen in past mod but
there's a big swing in thermals as you'd
expect we'll talk more about that aspect
in a moment with regard to clocks the
hybrid mod is able to boost slightly
higher in this power virus scenario
averaging about 14 43 megahertz core
whereas the stock card with the stock
cooler and auto settings ran 1392
megahertz on the court that's an extra
50 megahertz or so without any
overclocking effort so not bad well the
Titan XP is up against its clock limit
already so gains are minimal note also
that these tests are conducted with a
power virus scenario so that means that
the clock is enumerated differently from
a gaming workload that's okay because
we're just trying to stress the card
thermally but if you're testing it with
games you'd see a higher clock and lower
temperatures overall on the power
components getting into tests that
involve our thermocouple measurements on
the vram and MOSFETs this chart shows
our original Titan XP results would be
stocked cooler before the mod GPIO
temperatures were locked at around 84 C
which is the card's thermal threshold
for clock limiting MOSFETs were
operating around 60 to 70 C in this
scenario well within reasonable
operating range and the vram was running
parallel to the GPU temperature at about
80 to 83 c this is important by looking
at how vram tends to follow GPU
temperatures though at a slight delay as
indicated by the 200 to 350 second mark
on the chart we learned that there is a
need to pay attention to thermal density
with these tests rolling into the next
chart with our hybrid model using a 23%
vrm fan and 100% radiator
we now see the GP diode temperatures
around 40 C having the GPU diode reading
previously MOSFET and power component
temperatures are almost identical to the
previous test though note that the
hybrid does take longer at the rapid fat
temperatures than these card ultimately
we're not worse off of the FETs but we
can maintain equal temperatures of just
22% on the
I'm fan rather than north of 50 to 55
percent theorem is interesting and is
the newest item we've added to our
measurement the around temperature with
the hybrid has dropped down to about 75
C on a module we're measuring whereas it
was previously around 82 see our current
hypothesis is that this reduction is
primarily because of the increased
efficiency with which heat is removed
from the GPU reducing heat between all
of the vram modules the vram is
primarily cooled by the base plate so
removing that vapor chamber didn't hurt
the RAM temperatures at all in fact it
actually helped since we can now focus
all of our air cooling efforts strictly
on power and B RAM components the GPU is
taken care of within a closed loop as
indicated by the EVGA CLC it mounted to
the GPU proper if 100% radiator fan
speed is too high for noise reasons we
also tested at 40% speed by plugging
into the motherboard directly this is
where we can see the 100% radiator fan
speed exhibiting diminishing returns
considering our 40% gpio temperatures
only 12 to 13 C higher and still around
the 50 C mark max noise is measurably
lower at this speed as we'll show in a
bit with temperatures still under
control
the ERM temperature is still improved
with this fans filled with fat
temperature is still tied with the stock
configuration making 40% pretty
appealing overall here's a GN EQ chart
to make things easier to read over the
same test period and averaging a few
hundred cells of data after accounting
for ambient we see the hybrid modify
performance of the measured power and
VRAM components alongside the expected
GP diode improvement interestingly again
it almost makes more sense to run a fan
to the motherboard directly then just
set it something like 40% while leaving
the vrm fan at 23% we're cooling
everything adequately and operating at a
lower noise level than stock with 100%
speeds on the EVGA fan not really
posting significant benefits over 40%
speeds but still performing louder these
components are exciting to start
measuring seeing as we've always known
that hybrid mods benefit GPIO
temperatures but we weren't sure how
they affected componentry
now we know it's still better all this
talk about noise let's take a look at
the noise chart first of all the idle
temperature listed for the hybrid mod is
when running the fan at a 40 percent
noise profile as plugged into the
motherboard directly I have 40 percent
on the radiator fan and 22% of the
an hour idle noise output is about 30
2.5 DBA higher than idle for other
devices including the original Titan XP
but that's because we've added another
case fan to the mix again this test uses
a bench that is entirely passive other
than the GPU proper auto where the
radiator fan is running at 100% our
output is 39.1 DBA the stock cooler for
the Titan XP operated at around 48 DB a
year which is nearly two times louder by
human perception given the logarithmic
scale here's the thing if you wanted to
keep that 40% radiator fan speed since
we've shown it works just fine in our
test configuration the difference would
be even bigger we'd be looking at a
forty seven point nine DBA for auto on
the stock cooler as opposed to thirty
two point five DBA for the 40 percent
radiator fan and 20 percent PRM fan even
when under load thirty three DBA to 48
decibels is a huge jump in perceived
noise and makes it pretty convincing to
just run a hybrid cooler with a 40
percent fan speed we don't normally get
major gains with the overclocking in
these hybrid mods but increased clock
stability ultimately yields high
performance metrics in gaming anyway
we saw some increases in peak frequency
for each overclock step with this mod
ultimately settling at eight to 25
megahertz offset here's the overclock
step in for the Titan XP stock card
which will bump up to make room for the
hybrid OC stepping boosting memory speed
beyond 450 to 500 megahertz produced
diminishing returns as a drag down the
core clock likely due to power limit and
availability for gaming the core clock
is not only going to matter more than
the additional memory overclock so we
ran with a 450 to 500 megahertz memory
clock depending on how it impacted the
core let's get into some gaming
benchmarks will have all these in the
article includes description below but
go over a few results here start off
Ghost Recon wildlands at 4k the Titan XP
style card operated an average frame
rate of 60 FPS with loads at 52 and 48
without any overclock our Titan XP
hybrid model improves to 61 FPS average
54 fps 1% low and 50 FPS 0.1% low that's
not a huge jump at about a 1.7 percent
improvement but it's an improvement
nonetheless overclocked in the stock car
that landed us at 65 FPS average and
overclocking the hybrid bumped that to
68 FPS average result is a 4.6 percent
improvement in
when comparing Oh see - Oh see I have
1440p it's of similar stories a stock
Titan XP runs a 95 FPS average 35 fps 1%
low and 32 FPS 0.1% lows the hybrid
model low performance up to 85 and 82 it
notably with averages at 97 FPS average
overclocking performance shows the same
limited gains we experience a bump in
average with a bigger jump upward in
frame time consistency here's a frame
time chart showing the non overclocked
frame times of the stock tight next P
and the hybrid dot next B just to
illustrate the difference it's not huge
but you can definitely see it running
Mass Effect and draw it at 4k the Titan
XP stock card performs with an average
FPS of 68 loads at 56 and 53 while the
hybrid version runs a 71 FPS average and
lows at 57 53 the stocks of stock
improvement is about 4.4 percent for
this one for 1440p and 1080p results for
this game check the article link to the
description below let's look at doom
with Vulcan and async enabled the Titan
XP stock card operated at a frame rate
of 94 FPS average which improved to 108
FPS average when the overclocked the
hybrid mod meanwhile lands at 99 FPS
average so it's 5.5 percent ahead of the
stock Titan XP cooler and overclocking
gets us to 113 FPS average for an
increase of 4.3 percent over the Titan
XP air-cooled card when overclocked or
an improvement of 13 percent over the
hybrid models no OC one final game for
this video that will close out the rest
of these game tabs will be in the link
in the description below along with 3d
mark Sniper Elite 4 with the x12 and
async it places the Titan XP stock at 87
FPS average with the hybrid card bumping
up to 94 FPS average without any
overclock supplied that's just from the
thermal Headroom improvement from the
hybrid cooler so not bad this improves
our performance by about seven point
eight percent over the stock cooler
overclocking the Titan XP with its stock
cooler it gets the card 298 FPS average
for a gain of 12 point 2 percent over
baseline the Titan XP hybrid overclocked
a bit higher and held onto the frame
times better
netting 101 FPS average on the OC so
that more or less wraps it up this is
more about the noise and thermal
than gaming improvements with gaming as
we just went through it's not a huge
deal for the most part it the very best
case was snipe early where we seen
something like many percent improvement
just from that change so we're not
really seeing anything major otherwise
the noise department's a completely
different story because that can be
dragged down to less than 40 decibels in
our passive testing environment with the
noise floor about 26 DBA and performed
better thermally and actually better
than FPS for the most part then well
actually definitely better in FPS it's a
limited percentage then the stock Titan
XP with the stock air cooler it's not a
bad mod if you are spending $1,200
anyway an extra hundred dollars doesn't
sound too daunting I would like to see
this kind of cooling improved on in the
future for reference cards is probably
not going to happen there's a reason
reference cards are designed the way
they are and the in Nvidia both do the
blower fan designs they are easier for
sis to implement
they are more versatile so it makes
sense for them to do that especially
because if your mass producing them it's
cheaper to just buy a whole bunch of one
cooler but if you're in the mood to mod
something it's an easy mod to do this is
just not something we recommend for
gaming still but if you're buying it for
something like machine learning like
grant did then maybe it's worth
considering considered look into that
for your uses depending on how you feel
about noise levels of the stock cooler
and how you feel about temperature
output depending on what else is in the
box as for the rest of one quick note on
the game for honor is that interesting
bugs with for honor throughout all the
testing we've done with it it does just
fine when the cards are stock but as
soon as we overclocked them a lot of
them have weird instability issues and
it seems to be just that the that
particular game is causing more problems
with clock stability and overclock
stability than the other games we test
just something with how it's optimized
or how the shaders are used or something
like that this card in at ibrid state
actually had problems with for honor to
the point where I had to down clock it
back to make sure it was stuck at the
original stock
titin XP settings before the hybrid mod
because it would actually start
stuttering to the point where the game
was unplayable even at 4k but if you
drop the clocks down so that they're
similar or equal to the Titan XP stock
cooler version of the card then it hit
better it was fine
so really weird issue that was for honor
only none of the other games had that
