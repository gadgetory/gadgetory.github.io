hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be taking a look at a low-end X
570 motherboard the MGP X 570 gaming
plus from MSI so this is the successor
of the X 470 gaming plus which was one
of the cheapest x 470 motherboards you
could buy the thing is X 570 across the
board is far more expensive so don't
expect this to be anywhere like yeah
don't expect this board to be anywhere
near the price point of the X 470 gaming
plus that it's replacing unfortunately X
570 is way more expensive than X 417
just because of like the chipset cost
and and the PCIe 4.0 before that this

or click the link below to learn more
anyway before we get into the vrm let's
go around and highlight some sort of
worth worth noting noteworthy
overclocking features there's a BIOS
flashback BIOS flashback bus and hiding
right behind the I think USB ports over
here so you can update the bios of the
motherboard with just an 8 pin power
connector and a 24 pin plug it in no CPU
no ram no GPU no nothing just just a USB
stick with the right file format and a
file with the right file name hit the
button you can update the BIOS pretty
useful if you have the motherboard and a
incompatible CPU that requires a BIOS
update which considering like this is an
x5 70 board I really like you you'd be
looking at buying like a next-gen like
more newer than Rison 3000 CPU to run
into that situation so you know kind of
a hard situation to encounter on an x5
70 board I'd say but it is apatite like
that that's what it's meant to solve
anyway next to that we do get the eight
pin and the completely useless 4 pin
we all know what I think of four pins on
low and unnecessary for pin power
connectors on low-end motherboards so
I'm not even gonna go in well like let's
just put it this way that can handle 384
watts you don't need this at all
especially on a motherboard of this
caliber like if you overload that 8 pin
the vrm is already going to be gone
yeah like this vrm is gonna be gone by
the time you overload that 8 pin so you
know before you need that 4 pin but but
like if you if you actually pulled
enough power to need the 4 pin the RM
has no chance absolutely no chance I
mean it can't even max out the 8 pin so
anyway moving on we get some useful
features like a bunch of troubleshooting
LEDs over here so you have CPU errors
memory errors VGA so GPU errors and boot
media errors you know it'll just slide
up so it's not gonna be like it's not as
useful as a post code but it's
significantly useful more useful than
nothing and it's less obnoxious than
having the motherboard beep at you right
it'll just give you a little LED telling
you hey your your there's something
wrong with your memory or there's
something wrong with your CPU so pretty
useful to have like I consider this a
bare minimum for a lot of motherboards
there's motherboards that like other
words that don't have this annoy me a
lot like that's that's boards where it's
just like okay well that's below the
bare minimum for troubleshooting
features as far as I'm concerned if you
don't even have like little LEDs to
indicate roughly what component you
should be looking at super handy when
doing any kind of overclocking so that's
that and for clearing the while so
you've got the clear CMOS about a clear
CMOS jumper right here which I think
they could have positioned that a bit
better because like sometimes what I do
with say my systems is I hook up the
clear CMOS to the reset button of the
system right so that if you're of the
case so that if you're doing a lot of
overclocking you can just hit the reset
button and it clears the CMOS because
well the reset button isn't really that
useful in my opinion for a daily system
that often and if you're doing if you're
like setting up an overclock you'll be
potentially clearing the BIOS over and
over and
over again within a couple hours right
so I think this could have benefited
from being a button on the rear i/o
arguably more so than the BIOS flashback
I think the BIOS flashback is one of
those features that you use once and
then never again because after you've
updated the BIOS it's like you can just
use the BIOS flash utility in the vials
right like or you can even update the
BIOS for Windows so I've never done that
myself I always go through the BIOS so
yeah but still like a bit more
convenient than having to pull the
battery though by the time like
depending on your GPU and like PCIe
expansion card configuration pulling the
battery or shorting that jumper might be
equally annoying things to do right if
you have like a three slot GPU and then
uh then another card in here reaching
that is gonna be quite the adventure
anyway so that kind of covers all of the
basic overclocking features that the
motherboard offers also ignore these
those are for troubleshooting
engineering sample boards so those
aren't going to be present on the real
like if you buy the board retail those
won't be present at all you can just
ignore them so yeah with that out of the
way let's just get right into the vrm so
this right here is our V core right
there and that is a eight I don't know
what I'm doing it's an eight phase-- and
the next to that we have a two-phase SOC
VRM and for the controller we're looking
at an IR three five two zero one which
obviously does not support an A+ to
phase configuration right or at least
three five two zero one this goes all
the way up to eight phases but it does
not go up to eight plus two and this is
like the thing is this is a significant
upgrade from compared to like the x4 70
gaming plus that this motherboard
replaces as this is like the default
high end voltage controller for high-end
motherboards for the last several years
so you know like you're getting a pretty
serious international rectifier voltage
controller right here with this board
and
it is a low-end x5 70 so this is this is
not like the cheese like this is
definitely not cheap to do though it is
still I think like a five ish dollar
chip so it's not like you know and I
assume that it's the alternative for the
cheaper boards is like two or three
dollars so it's not huge change in terms
of the cost of like one chip like if
that was the only thing you change on
the entire board it's like five dollars
but uh yeah the the thing is it doesn't
do like it doesn't integrate drivers and
that kind of thing so when you actually
want to use a three five two zero one it
gets more expensive than just the fact
that you're replacing the controller
because if you're replacing a controller
that integrates like three or four of
your phase drives then it's like well
now you need to buy three or four new
drivers anyway here it is running
configure it as a four plus two phase
and on the back of the board we of
course find a bunch of doublers as well
as a dual driver now all of those are
there we go
so the first chip over here is a dual
driver so that's our two phases for the
SOC and then here we have a doubler and
I don't know why I'm changing the
capitalization of the DS so don't know
there we go doubler and then we've got
two three and four doublers over there
and all of these chips are international
rectifier IR 3598 because the 3598 is a
dual driver with an optional doubling
function so for like this one over here
you have two phases from the ir35 to
zero one go in and then two completely
independent phases come out because it
literally is like having to say CHL
eight five ten drivers in one chip
except this is weaker than a CHL five
ten because like a CHL a five ten is the
same sized chip except it drives one
phase so it's significantly it's a
pretty significantly stronger driver
than this one but uh yeah like that you
only have to worry about the strength of
the driver if you're trying to drive
some really like slow power like well
high capacitance power MOSFETs all right
which this board doesn't need to worry
about because the this is using some
pretty
normal low side powers mullets they're
not the not the worst ever but like if
like the eight five ten is a good fit
for something like a sixty eight ninety
four or in some cases there's GPUs where
they'll actually like put two sixty
eight ninety fours in parallel and at
that point it's like yeah you need a
pretty serious driver to switch those
kinds of MOSFETs on and off at or even
as a nibble speed so there are thirty
five ninety I wouldn't really work very
well but here it's fine like these are
pretty normal MOSFETs so anyway here we
have one running as a doubler so one PWM
signal it goes in and then to drive two
sets of drive go out to the actual
phases fully interleaved and yeah so
that's kind of the control scheme that
you're looking at with this vrm and for
this board especially this has some
pretty major benefits because since it
does use discrete MOSFETs the efficiency
of the vrm is quite heavily dependent on
the switching frequency because like
that one of the big advantages like
higher power stages have over discreet
MOSFETs is that they have significantly
lower switching losses because they the
the MOSFETs inside a power stage your
optimized to switch much faster than
your discrete like your normal discreet
MOSFET and the end result is that you
can go from like 300 kilohertz to 500
kilohertz and not really notice a
significant change in heat output
whereas on something like this 500
kilohertz these MOSFETs would produce
way more heat than they would produce at
300 kilohertz so with a vrm like this
the doublers make a pretty major you
know give you a pretty major efficiency
advantage and you also get reduced or
you know if you decide to run them at a
higher switching frequency so let's say
you're going from a four phase at 450
kilohertz which is the X 470 Gaming plus
to what this is which you could do eight
phases at 450 cards well you can have
significantly lower output ripple at
roughly the same efficiency or you can
go and drop the switching frequency all
the way down to like 250 kilohertz
potentially have still slightly better
output ripple because you are on eight
phases not just for and yet have much
better vrm efficiency because each of
the high side MOSFETs is being switched
on and off 250 thousand times a second
instead of four hundred and fifty
thousand times a second right so
a pretty major dig pretty large drop in
switching losses right there because of
that anyway let's talk about efficiency
now for efficiency I'm going with 300
kilohertz switching frequency at each of
the phases because that's a pretty
normal
switching frequency to run even discrete
MOSFETs at like 3 well you could make a
design of erm around a lower switching
frequency than that but you generally
don't do that like you generally don't
do that kind of thing so yeah 1.2 volts
output voltage 300 kilohertz switching
frequency and 12 volts gate to source
voltage so that that's the the drive
voltage for the MOSFETs this is
important because you can drive most
like you can switch a MOSFET like this
with 5 volts but the thing is if you do
that you get a significantly higher RDS
own they also take longer to switch on
and off and well you end up with worse
overall vrm power efficiency so with a
motherboard like this it's like they
actually you get best efficiency with
like 10 volts the thing is on a
motherboard you already have a 12 volt
rail so it's like why would you convert
your 12 volts into 10 volts just to
drive your MOSFETs it's much easier to
take 12 volts and just jam that into the
MOSFETs the MOSFETs you know they'll
handle that kind of voltage not fuck it
just fine so 12 volts gate to source
drive voltage for this anyway
so with those operating parameters and
300 cord switching frequency there so
that's the operating parameters for the
vrm that I'm going to be doing the
efficiency with and it's also worth
noting that when I do discrete MOSFET
VRM efficiency I do not factor in the
power consumed by the drivers so like
the the ir35 99-98 on the back of the
board those produce heat i'm not
factoring those in for convenience which
is pretty lazy of me the reason why I
consider like don't factor them in is
they don't really make that much of a
difference to your overall power
consumption they might be like 1 or 2
watts in total right spread across the
entire VRM they might be even less than
1 watt the reason why it's important
that I'm not factoring them in is that
low outputs that makes discrete MOSFETs
look really good because I'm not
factoring in the like fixed amount of
power loss that you get from having
drive like from the drivers
because if that driver has to switch the
moss-like as long as that driver is
turning the MOSFET on and off that is
power being lost - turning the MOSFET on
and off like that costs energy to do and
I'm just not factoring that power loss
in because at high current outputs it's
like a very small portion of your
overall heat output so not particularly
important at low current outputs it
makes discrete MOSFETs looks kind of
silly efficient compared to power stages
because if I have power stages they
automatically factor in the driver
losses in their heat output so like I
would actually have to do more work to
remove the driver loss from like a power
say you know efficiency calculation so
I'm just just pointing that out as like
if at low current output the discrete
Massa if this looks really efficient at
a hundred amps output it's mostly
because I'm ignoring the fact that the
driver is also Berna maybe like a watch
or two and yeah that makes this vrm look
a bit better than it should but it's not
super important which is why as I said
for convenience I kind of ignore that so
100 amps output which is a little bit
like that should be pretty close to the
amount of current and that's a maxout
3800 X or a maxed out 3700 X poles this
V arm will be producing about 12.5 watts
of heat at 300 kilohertz so about there
at 125 amps which is around where you'd
want to like that's the maximum current
you'd really want to be running a 2700 X
on you'd be looking at about 18 watts of
heat output going up to a hundred and 50
amps so you'd be looking at about 24
watts of heat output and at this point
it's worth like that this is a pretty
serious amount of heat and so let's talk
a little bit about the cooling system
that MSI has designed well actually the
thermal management that MSI is doing on
this vrm so there's a huge advantage
that this the x5 70 gaming plus has over
the x4 70 gaming plus in that this vrm
is not one blob of four phases it's six
phases and then two phases so what
basically you have is 3/4 of the heat
output of the vrm goes into this massive
heat sink right over here and I know it
doesn't look like it has a ton of
surface area but the profile for that
heat sink looks something like this and
then the MOSFETs are at the bottom of
that right so you actually have a good
amount of surface area it's just not
very visible so and I've tested
motherboards with this style of a
heatsink but on v4 50 it works really
well like this style of a heatsink is
awesome I'm actually not sure why for
high-end motherboards if you wanted to
just kind of make like make your life
easy and make really good VR I'm cooling
with the end and just eliminate like the
i/o cover and the easiest thing to do
would be just to put a big metal block
that doubles as both of the RM heatsink
as and in i/o cover just does both
because you'd have a ton of surface area
for VR I'm cooling and you'd also have
the whole aesthetic benefits of an i/o
cover right without actually having to
resort to a to a piece of plastic like
most motherboards do anyway so I'm a big
fan of this style of heatsink and it's
only handling 3/4 of the overall heat
output of the vrm the other 1/4 of the V
curve erm is actually dumped into the
heatsink up here and that one has a
similar profile like it doesn't look
like it has a lot of fins but it looks
kind of like that from the side so it
has a decent amount of surface area as
well and you know in the case of the 24
Watts that were throwing at the vrm at
150 amps this is roughly where like the
12 core would max out on say water
cooling that would be only 8 watts of
heat now I'm not 8 that's way too much 6
watts of heat being dumped into that
heatsink and 18 watts of heat being
dumped into this heatsink in my testing
with the B 450 mortared titanium this
heatsink is more than capable of
handling 18 watts like the it's not a
problem for this heatsink whatsoever
6 watts for this heatsink same situation
absolutely not not an issue so yeah like
this is not the most efficient vrm ever
right like if we compare this to some of
the other motherboards the x5 70
motherboards I've covered this is
actually quite an awful amount of heat
for just 150 amps but if you throw a big
enough heatsink at it and you spread the
heat out in a clever way you don't need
a stupid efficient vrm right there's
kind of two ways you can design a good
cooling system or you can design
efficient vrm if you design your really
efficient vrm you can throw the
heatsinks out the window potentially if
it's efficient enough you don't need
heat sinks right if you're vrm isn't
efficient enough you need to get clever
with your cooling solution and that's
kind of what MSI has done here and it
doesn't like it doesn't even need to be
super elaborate like this is still
basically just a little an aluminum
block with some fins cut into it so you
know it's not like state-of-the-art heat
sink technology right there it's just
that big block of aluminum with a lot of
surface area turns out works pretty well
especially when you don't try to dump
all of the vrm heat into it and you
spread it over an even another block of
aluminum so you know the 12 core I would
be really surprised if this motherboard
struggled with vrm thermals when
overclocking the 12 core and potentially
with the three five two zero one MSI
does give you the option to change vrm
switching frequency so if you have the
12 core you might find that you have so
much thermal Headroom that you can
actually just like raise the the
switching frequency a bit to maybe get
slightly better overclocking by reducing
the vrm output ripple so yeah like I'm a
I'm a pretty big fan of this this VR I'm
considering that it's unlike a low-end
motherboard now anyway
moving up to like 16 core current draw
figures like a hundred and seventy amps
and this is keep in mind this is all
overclocking this is not at stock if
you're running at stock the AMD's TDP is
like 105 watts so if we assume that AMD
actually law-like agrees to the laws of
physics which they don't because they're
the most like the fun fact most x4 70
motherboards override the 2700 X's TDP
from 105 Watts to like 130 ish so that's
why 2700 X's don't run on their rated
TDP it's because the motherboards tell
them hey it's fine to pull 130 so the
2700 X does but uh like they still add
stock you wouldn't be looking at like
these kinds of current draw figures
that's very much overclocking 175 amps
you're gonna be looking at about 30
watts of heat output for the vrm which
would translate into about 7.5 watts of
eat on this heatsink and about 20 2.5
watts of heat on the other eat sink
which I think should still like the this
is approaching I think the
the limits of what this heatsink can
handle but depending on how much air
flow you have this should still not be a
massive issue to deal with
so yes the 16 core could probably run on
this motherboard just fine as well and
then going all the way up to 200 amps
which would be a completely maxed out 16
core you'd be looking at about 38 watts
of heat so you can see at this point
that like the increase in heat output is
getting pretty drastic for every step of
the way because well the rme efficiency
curves look something like this or wait
right or heat output four phases look
something like that so we are now
getting into this area because this vrm
is really not meant for handling a ton
of current like these these are
halfway-decent MOSFETs but they're not
incredible and so at 200 amps this we
are I might say it's pretty pretty close
to maxed out the heat sinks should you
know you'd be looking at close to 30
watts on this one which I'm not sure how
well that'll handle it this one will
handle that and close to 10 watts on
this one which 10 watts on this one I
don't think is actually a problem 30 on
the other hand is a lot of heat so I'm
not sure how that would work out for
that but uh yeah that is like maxing out
a 16 core so obviously not something
this like this is not something I would
say the motherboard is really meant for
and you know you can't always just throw
a fan at the heat sinks that tends to
take care of any VR and thermal issues
really really quickly because fun like
if you have an a IO the airflow around
the vrm tends to be non-existent if you
have a tower air cooler you still
generally don't actually have that much
air flow over the VRM or what airflow
you do have might be like use it up air
that has gone through an like a freakin
heatsink right so it's already hot from
the cpu so yeah but throwing a fan
somewhere near the vrm like potentially
what would make sense is to put like a
fan that sits like right here right and
blows air up through like under the the
vrm heat sink and just channels it at
the top of your case that would
potentially work really really well
but you know like if you're sticking a
12 core on this motherboard I'd well no
16 core 12 cores
as I said earlier like 612 core should
be fine 16 core you might start needing
to get creative with like fan you know
placing a fan around the vrm so anyway
that's the vrm efficiency and I just
realized that I forgot to mention what
all sets this motherboard is on so each
phase is made up of a single high side
MOSFET and a single low side MOSFET high
side MOSFET is a 4c 0:29 and from on
semiconductor this is actually a pretty
solid high side MOSFET but what really
what I really like about this vrm is
that low side because for like the thing
is this is a 4c 0 24 n right yes it is
and if this is a 2.8 million RDS on low
side most fact and the reason why this
is important is a lot of other cheap
motherboards go for like for millions
RDS on and a very very very large
portion of the heat output of your erm
is caused by P equals I squared times R
so this is heat out current resistance
of the MOSFET right so if you are at 4
milli ohms like that like literally it's
I squared times 4 instead of I squared
times 2.8 well zero point zero zero two
eight vs. 0.004 right because milli ohms
but anyway you get the idea so this is
actually a pretty major improvement over
a lot of other mothers like as far as
low and multi low end motherboard
MOSFETs go this is a really nice low
side because they tend to be terrible in
a lot of cases so yeah and that's why
this movie are em you know which like
it's still not super efficient but it
can still and it's not that different
from like the erm on the x4 70 gaming
plus it can still just about handle you
know the 16 core and it should have no
problem with the 12 core because of the
quite clever cooling system setup that
MSI has here so anyway let's move on
from the VRM to the memory section for
the memory and topology we're looking at
a daisy-chain layout so and we can
actually see that on the back of the
board which is kind of neat in my
opinion like I'm always a fan of
anything that you can just look at and
be like oh that's what it is
cuz yeah so this is a daisy chain and
you can see it most clearly like right
here right so you can see this trace
comes in hits this pin then it goes on
and it hits that pin and that tells you
it's a daisy chain because while it goes
from one limb slot to the next stem slot
and if you have a daisy chain topology
then the top like this topology
basically favors to dim configurations
in general you can like it really
depends like there's a lot of BIOS
tuning you can do to like work around
the downsides of daisy chain so the main
problem with daisy chain is that if you
put a dim slot in this you have two
Dame's on the same channel like that
then the timing for signals going to
this Dame is a little bit different from
the timing for signals going to that
Dame and that causes like overclocking
issues right that's what restricts the
oil potentially limit the maximum memory
frequency you can run on the flip side
like if you just have one de min daisy
chain it actually works really really
well so if you have it on the the second
name slot like that that actually works
really really well with daisy chain so
this motherboard should be great for
like 2 by 8 gigabyte memory
configurations should overclock
amazingly well on this 2 by 16 kind of
depends on really depends on the memory
sticks and how well the motherboard
actually supports said memory stick
cuz there's kind of like 2 by 16 is a
kind of weird configuration also I don't
know how well 16 gigabit memory chips
overclocked so these things get strange
at that point but assuming MSI supports
whatever dims you are using properly
this should actually work really well as
well compared to say 4 by 8 because 4 by
8 is just inherently not supposed to
work as well on a daisy chain as a 2 by
16 should but there's BIOS stuff that
can also happen that will maybe make 4
by 8 work better than 2 by 16 but
generally Daisy changed in favor 2 by 16
and then you know there's 2 by 32 but 2
by 32 is like a huge question mark
because I don't know any like I've not
seen any testing done with that can
memory configuration yeah
I plan to do some testing of my own for
it but you know like it's gonna be a
while before I managed to do that and I
don't yet have any x5 70 motherboards so
I don't know how that's gonna work out
on x5 74 by 16 on the other hand is also
a huge question mark because it's super
depends like it's like 2 by 16 except
with like 4 by 8 problems
added on top right like that's the thing
is just like it's a mess so yeah but
more does daisy-chain so it should
prefer these two DIMM slots and at least
if you're running 2 by 8 it should
overclock really really well and then
for the other higher capacity
configurations it kind of depends like
hopefully there's going to be some other
Board reviews covering the different
memory configurations that work well on
each motherboard but that tends to take
forever to test and I don't really know
of any reviewers really doing that and I
don't want to do that myself because as
I just said it takes forever to test
though I do try to sometimes test it
myself a bit anyway so yeah that is oh I
forgot to mention the SOC vrm and the
memory RM but the thing is like that
gives you an idea of how important they
are so the SOC BRM as I said earlier
it's two phases the MOSFETs are QA
thirty one one one and six is from Ubik
semiconductor and their dual NFS so
highside and low-side integrated into
one package I have no data sheet for
these it doesn't really matter that much
because the system on a chip of horizon
doesn't really pull that much power but
it's just like yeah I couldn't give you
more information on these if I try it
because I literally don't have any more
information than that and then for
memory power we are looking at a single
phase with two high side MOSFETs and two
low side MOSFETs which actually this is
one of the more powerful single phase
memory VRMs out there 4 X 5 70
motherboards it also completely doesn't
matter because it's mostly down to what
you do between the memory sloths and the
CPU socket with ddr4 ddr4 doesn't really
pull that much power
so yeah this like it's a single phase
it's got nice it's got the same MOSFETs
as your V curve erm but I wouldn't you
know focus on it too much because it's
mostly going to come down to the middle
the bias of the motherboard and the
trace layout of the motherboard which
fortunately I can't tell you for sure
that this is good but it is a daisy
chain and so it should work really well
with two by eight and then everything
else is just kind of like what does the
bios support best I'm not really
concerned about the vrm for ddr4 it
doesn't pull enough power so yeah that
is it for the for this video so thanks
for watching like share subscribe leave
any comment oh wait I should have done
like a conclusion well yeah that that's
that's it for the video
you know the MSI x5 70 gaming + which is
a low-end x5 70 motherboard that does
not make it cheap it just means it's
like at the bottom of the product stack
4 X 570 from MSI I think it's like the
second to the bottom of MSI's product
snack there's one other motherboards
that like even lower end than this and
yeah I mean you know you should handle
the 12 core just fine 16 core should
also work but the VR I'm calling when I
actually get a bit of a workout at that
point and yeah so that's it thanks for
watching like share subscribe leave any
