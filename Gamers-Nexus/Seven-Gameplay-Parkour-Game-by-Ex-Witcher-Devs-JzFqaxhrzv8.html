grouped together to form pools theory
developing a new parkour driven
isometric RPG called seven the day's
long gone
it's a unique effort to introduce new
jump and climb mechanics to improve in
genre and one which recently provided us
with a full hour-long hands-on session
at PAX East seven is a jump and climb
parkour style action RPG with an
isometric camera along with mages of
Myst rally iseven is in our top games
for PAX East 2016 and for very similar
reasons it's got a strong focus on story
innovative new mechanics sports genre
and is being built by seasons developers
7 is set in a quote beyond
post-apocalyptic future mankind has
already been destroyed and it's now in
the slow rebuild phase putting us a step
beyond what we're used to in this type
of game the game starts on the plateau
of pet the Knights of Knee want their
monosyllabic naming back and drops the
player into a demon-possessed character
our demon character was Tyrael in our
demo and he's a thief who's hosting the
Demon Lord art enak both characters have
their own schemes and must work together
to learn about the world secrets and
it's incumbent Empire of Vetrov we are
told that this story has a 10-hour arc
and really the thing that focus on here
outside of the story is of course the
mechanics mechanically speaking 7 is
driven by gear choices more than
traditional attribute trees core
controls consist of attacking running
and parkour movement with gear selection
governing play style this makes 7 a
classless RPG so if you want to change
your playstyle for a scenario that's
done pretty easily by changing the
loadout of the character high-powered
offense of equipment was used in our
demo for a more direct approach to
progress or inflicting democracy as it
may be and lighter gear can be opted for
when trying to take a stealthier or more
roundabout means of objective completion
a game storage system makes it easy to
keep gear without bloating inventory so
players can play dress up before moving
forth with objectives but it's not made
so easy that when you're out in the
wilds you'll be able to just instantly
change your gear to accommodate for
whatever is happening in the game you've
got a plan ahead
and that means that this is not quite so
trivial gameplay interactions are logged
to a database for later recall in
progressing storylines players will
contend with their literal inner demon
with townspeople guards military
opposition magic users and the
environment and as an example of how
that environment guides play moving from
zone to zone
requires a tracking passport sort of a
visa of sorts and it can also be done by
tech hacking or sneaking past security
at the borders so in this regard zone
controller border control is more than
just a lazy excuse for an invisible wall
there are ways around the passport
acquisition and that is again tech
hacking and sneaking so in the event the
players have forged enemies with the
authorities that be there are
alternatives and they're perhaps more
fun for certain play styles depending on
how you want to approach the game each
of these instances influences how the
story unfolds the world is a non linear
sandbox at its heart littered with skill
based freerunning obstacles verticality
and weather events that apply modifiers
to core mechanics rain even hinders NPC
vision and movement which is really not
that common and it's not just the player
who's affected in this regard if a
particular border proves difficult to
cross for instance sneaking across it
whatever tactically inclined players can
wait until a rainy night to make the
move at which point the guards are far
less likely to detect the player visuals
speak for themselves and the audio as
linked on the company's soundcloud and
ODS website is brilliantly composed by
these two fellows I'm not even gonna
attempt the names honestly they should
be on the screen now you'll be
sympathetic I'm sure but 7 is still in
progress it's still in development they
hope to release in late 2016 but based
on discussions and what we've seen we're
guessing that early 2017 is more likely
there's a PC game you can play with
controller or keyboard and it's
basically an isometric parkour inspired
RPG so pretty cool stuff definitely
worth watching out for especially
because the team does have some serious
experience in the form of The Witcher
and other major titles so keep an eye
out for 7 as always we'll post reviews
or more detailed preview content as
things approach finalization if you like
this type of content as always that link
in description below for an article
patreon link and
so video to help sigh directly and I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
