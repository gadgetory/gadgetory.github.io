review and it's not just because we had
to hire an intern to eat the 18 pounds
of Reese's Cups that Coolermaster
included with the case we tried hard to
make the Q 500 I'll perform well in
testing we tried to force good
performance out of it with Patrick
spending probably about a week longer on
this case testing than we would
typically spend this is cooler masters Q
500 l mini case for full ATX
motherboards we're using the Q 300
tooling from a micro ATX case designed
previously but shifting the power supply
around to accommodate 80 export it's a
unique approach to an enclosure and at
$60 we can overlook a lot of limitations
in favor of affordability but it really
has to outweigh those limitations
somewhere before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte Z 390 ARS
master motherboard which comes equipped
with one of the more powerful z3 90 V
RMS for heavier overclocks on the new
ninth gen Intel CPUs the ARS Master is
also one of the few motherboards with a
real heatsink this generation featuring
a mix of high surface area fins and
looks oriented hover blocks oh and it's
also got updated RDV illumination learn
more at the link below really quick
overview of this case before we get into
the build notes and a lot of thermal
data we have more thermal data on this
case and probably any other single case
we've ever tested and it's because we
were trying so hard to get it to do well
but it didn't happen we'll talk about
that later so the case itself it's a
small box really small but it fits ATX
boards it also fits our 150 millimeter
Heights CPU tower cooler which is
impressive and it fits a relatively full
length video card the gaming axe MSI
card which is among the larger ones up
until you get into the three slot
designs all of that fits in here in fact
coolermaster has photos of this case as
we'll talk about later fitting with
their their massive thread ripper air
cooler and two of the asus 2.8 slot
video cards now not not particularly a
good idea for how to use this case but
it can fit so really what happened is
it's it's tooling that's been reused and
that's why the price is so low at $60
what they've done is take an existing
case
relocate the the power supply and you
end up with something that fits ATX
boards previously designed for micro ATX
except the power supplies now at the
front and the screws just going right
there and then you cover the screws with
a filter this is a custom one that
Coolermaster made for us because they're
playing around with the idea of doing
custom filters for customers in the
future but the stock one is like that so
the case itself is really it's pretty
simple internally it's a big empty box
well it's a small empty box but it's an
empty box nonetheless and you've really
got support for the board and that's
about it
the oversights are many and we'll go
over them in the build notes but just to
talk about air flow momentarily what
happens here is this is a stock it comes
with one rear exhaust fan a large
portion of that fan is blocked by the
back side of the case it's got about
eighty millimeters of actual space it
can push air through and then in the
front you end up with a filter on top of
a bunch of perforations in the steel
panel and unfortunately because this
steel panel the perforations are so much
more metal than they are not metal you
end up with obstructions to airflow
where really they shouldn't exist these
holes should be larger to have a more
proper mesh approach intake is also
problematic on the bottom so there's
really not much space here we typically
want to see about an inch of distance
between the ground and any ventilation
that's supposed to be used but you can
rotate the case like this and this is
actually an intended use case so it's
got these on this side panel the thumb
screws have rubber feet on them you can
sit it like that and you just pop the
panel back on top and that's the end of
that so let's go through the build notes
by Patrick go through the thermals and
then we'll talk about what the thermals
mean in the conclusion of this review
but it's going to be a long one the
worst feature of our Q 500l is that it
permanently smells like cheap chocolate
no matter how many times I pay Patrick
to wipe it down a much better feature is
that clear masters focus on modularity
as a parent although the cramped
interior limits some of the potential
configurations there's
six different mounting locations for the
i/o panel a power supply bracket that
can be attached in multiple different
locations and orientations and the whole
case is tactically sort of invertible
fans can be screwed on to the perforated
panels pretty much anywhere there's
space and magnetic filters can be
slapped on to the top to hide the screws
our case shipped with one magnetic
filter on the front as well as several
extras packed separately but we opted to
use only the front filter in testing
they fit neatly against the case trim
and the case looked equally good with
the filters on or off as long as there's
nothing screwed into those panels once
something is attached like a power
supply using a filter to cover up the
screw heads looks much cleaner for the
final build once a position is decided
on coolermaster also includes that small
rubber stoppers that clip into the case
and keep the filter centered the bottom
filter is a little disappointing in
comparison a rectangle of non-magnetic
mesh that's popped into place using 8
easily lost rubber pins this is the only
filter with cutouts for the case legs
but if the legs are removed and the case
is laid out horizontally a magnetic
filter can be stuck here too speaking of
those case legs they are exceptionally
short this will come into play in
thermal testing typically we find that a
one-inch clearance is advisable for
anything relying upon bottom intake or
bottom airflow even in the stock
configuration with no intake fans this
case will naturally draft air in through
the bottom by way of its negative
pressure setup and the proximity of the
GPU fans to the bottom cooler master
should use taller feet for the next
iteration of this design if there is one
to get closer to that one-inch elevation
one side panel is a thin sheet of clear
plastic held into place with plain old
thumb screws at each corner but that's
not unreasonable at this price point it
is a cheap case so that's fair the steel
side panel is held in with four rubber
range of screws that SS feet if the case
is laid on its side which is a clever
feature it'd be a bad idea to use this
case as a monitor stem like the Kotaku
for instance as the reversion to acrylic
paneling means easy scratches on that
side panel in a way the interior of the
cue 500l is as simple as it could
possibly be since it's just one big
chamber installing the power supply
proof
more complicated because Coolermaster
provides a ventilated bracket for the
power supply that can be positioned in
several different locations including
the bottom of the case if a mini ITX
port is installed exactly like the Q 300
L the stock position is inside of the
front panel cables down and plug up with
an extension cable running to the rear
of the case our usual coursera RM 650 X
was too tall to clear the end of our GPU
so we were forced to use the power
supply from our small form-factor bench
the enter max revolution SFX it would
also be too tall but the length is short
enough that the whole power supply can
sit above the GPU be aware that long GPU
coolers directly affect the power supply
clearance in this enclosure and
colormaster recommends 140 millimeter
power supplies to maximize compatibility
it's also worth mentioning that with the
power supply mounted on the front panel
its size and number of cables directly
affect front intake Coolermaster
provided a photo in the review guide of
a system with an e ATX motherboard and
ATX power supply a massive thread report
our cooler and to triple slot Strix GPUs
which is an excellent example of what
could potentially fit in this case could
not should this configuration would
perform exceptionally poorly especially
for that central GPU nothing about this
would perform well do not replicate the
setup but you can see that a lot of
things can fit in the case since there's
no power supply shroud there will always
be some number of cables that are
visible inside of the case there's some
cable management space behind the
motherboard but we didn't make much use
of it since the GPU and the 24 pin power
connectors are positioned directly next
to the power supply which for our build
had short cables cable cutouts along the
edge of the motherboard are surprisingly
adequate given how it tight the
constraints are and there are plenty of
cable tie points but again everything
was so close together in this case that
we didn't need more than one or two of
those we experimented with inverting the
power supply for some of our thermal
tests but moving the power supply lower
brought back the same problems with GPU
clearance that we had with the RM 6 with
DX it was a struggle to get everything
wet din it could be done but the power
supply begins blocking the right half of
the card and if your fins are oriented
horizontally in the card that means
exhausting straight into a wall
a steel wall probably from the Paris fly
the extension cable isn't quite long
enough either to reach the opposite
corner of the case unless it's routed
through the interior which is obviously
ugly making this orientation even more
difficult to set up you'd probably want
to get a different extension cable to
make things cleaner we did so many
thermal tests that Patrick spent nearly
a week longer on this case review than
we typically spend we are definitely
going to lose money on this review it's
worth it though because we really wanted
to give the case a fair shot and we also
retested the test bench in other cases
that we've previously reviewed to
validate that it's performance was
unchanged and reliable and it did pass
validation here's a list of those tests
we'll I don't know put it on the screen
or something or maybe show us some of
the happened but there's a lot so number
one torture no front filter power supply
moved and one fan was another test since
we used an SFF power supply we were able
to flip it and put it cable end up and
install it on the bottom half of the
front panel under the GPU and put 120
millimeter Noctua fans where the power
supply had been another test upright
with two fans the next test on its side
with two fans this is the same as above
or previously but with the case on its
side since there's barely any clearance
for air intake on the bottom of the case
with it upright number five on its side
plus two fans no filters number six of
eight better exhaust same as the
original test but with the stock fan
swapped out for a knock to oh on number
seven best case test a last-ditch effort
to make the case cool well with our
setup and last best case with front
exhaust because the results still
weren't great we did one final test with
the NZXT fan flipped around in the front
to exhaust out of the front panel the
stock tortured test was the worst 4cv
temperature with an average of seventy
four point four degrees Celsius over
ambient under a torture workload so this
chart is showing just the Q 500 L
variations right now look at comparative
data momentarily and remember that's
over ambient so in reality seventy four
point four degrees when accounting for
ambient becomes closer to well about a
hundred degrees when you look at the
peaks this means that at times the CPU
is forced to down clock which is
something we rarely see in case reviews
normally removing the front filter would
significantly help but since the power
supply was blocking the section of the
front
panel in front of the CPU cooler the
effect on CV temperature is negligible
and clocks dropped to about the same
degree we ended up at a 74 degree
celcius measure for this test not
changing much at all other than the idle
temperatures adding one fan and turning
the case on its side helped a little bit
but since the added fan was on the lower
half of the panel it only lowered the
CPU temperature by a couple of degrees
to 71 point four degrees over ambient
throttling was less severe but still
present using the stock configuration
with a higher quality knock to a 1500
RPM fan replacing the stock 1200 RPM fan
helped to lower CPU dial the temperature
by roughly the same amount down to 70
point nine degrees Celsius over ambient
and also not enough once again to
prevent throttling every test from here
down kept the CPU cool enough to prevent
down clocking which is good because they
all used an additional case fan for
cooling the CPU specifically either
pulling air directly in from the front
panel or at a right angle from the top
panel into the CPU tower core will open
up a comparative chart now but will port
over the best results with all of our
changes to the Q 500 out the best result
was sixty one point four degrees Celsius
over ambient with the case on its side
two added fans and all filters removed
and that's still among the very hottest
results on our chart the Q 500 out with
all of that extra help is still almost
on the level of the SL 600 I'm in terms
of CPU cooling and that's a case with a
completely sealed front panel no stock
fans directly aimed at the CPU cooler
and only bottom intake which is very far
away from the CPU and useful primarily
for GPU cooling the bottom intake also
has to get around the GPU so a bigger
card will further restrict CPU cooling
performance that should illustrate where
the Q 500 I'll land everything in this
case is in tight proximity and airflow
isn't as good as it could be with a
normal fan mount the perforated panels
are great for allowing flexibility but
they allow less air through than a
normal hole in a case would and are
comprised of too much steel and too
little hole the tightly confined space
doesn't help either with little room for
radiative heat to escape but we've seen
small cases manage decent cooling before
the big
problem is that with a full ATX board
the power supply has to be placed on the
front panel depending on where it's
placed either the GPU or the CPU will
suffer as a result
three of the four hottest GPU tests were
also the test where an intake fan was
placed on the bottom of the case pointed
directly into the GPU cooler where the
GPU die is located in fact of the ten
torture test passes that we ran in
different configurations
six of the seven worst GPU temperature
results were with a fan added
specifically meant to benefit the GPU
common sense dictates that these should
be the coolest results especially with
the case on its side however with a
positive pressure setup in such a small
case a problem develops with where the
hot air goes we initially thought that
maybe the loose bottom filter was
allowing the bottom intake fan to
recirculate hot air from inside the case
rather than pulling air in through the
filter from the outside but removing it
only lowered thermals by a couple
degrees
in terms of both temperature and average
frequency the best result was achieved
by just replacing the stock exhaust fan
and leaving the rest of the case stock
our observation is that this is a
mixture of problems we have a scenario
where a tall GPU is butted up right
against the side panel on one side the
other side of the card is against the
power supply and so the air wants to
escape at the rear PCIe slot and also
into the power supply at the front
because the fins are oriented
horizontally the air hitting the power
supply will get recirculated into the
GPU fans causing the video card to pull
in its own hot exhaust and recycle it
there isn't enough exhaust away from the
card to keep ambient low and so we hit
run away scenarios where thermals keep
climbing as the card throttles there
isn't enough exhaust to balance all the
hot intake and the fans on the bottom
that are doing intake are really just
pushing that hot air back into the card
where it came from
one key observation is that in the test
where a fan was added to the front panel
aim so that it would push air front to
back underneath the GPU and the case was
laid on its side CPU temperature lowered
while GPU temperature rose the stock
configuration the CPU cooler and exhaust
fans drew hot air away from the GPU and
out of the case worsening CPU
temperatures in the process where you
have radiative heat issues again off the
back of the car when a decent intake fan
has added the case goes from negative
pressure to positive pressure
which influences how the air paths form
in the case when the GPU and CPU are
both spinning their fans comparatively
the queue 500l does poorly on our chart
with all the other cases even when we
tried hard to get it to do well it just
didn't rank well on the stack and is one
of the worst cases we've worked with in
our entire case review history this
chart of average GPU frequency tells
more of the story we were hitting 84
degrees Celsius on the card regularly
with our joint thermal torture which
means dropping clocks to keep
temperatures at 84 C this is Boost 3.0
at work performance starts to fall off
as a result of this that is clearly an
exhaust problem based on this sort of
odd line up by first look and we are
also dealing with issues of the CPU air
flow and GPU airflow directly impacting
each other more than in the other cases
we've worked with this is due to a
smaller interior and obstructions
scattered throughout the case like the
proximity to the glass panel and the
proximity of the power supply you could
brute-force things to make it work
better like blasting the GPU fans be at
90% using the CLC for the CPU but they
will still cool comparatively worse two
other cases and will also become much
louder we normally run only one fire
strike test and the stock case
configuration but since the stock
configuration of this case caused our
CPU to overheat so much we decided to
try an additional batch the stock
configuration resulted in a GPU
temperature of sixty point seven degrees
Celsius over ambient which is a number
that practically ties it with the antec
p8 and among the hottest cases on the
chart it'd be difficult for a case to
score a GPU temperature higher than this
the GPU we use for testing down clocks
in an attempt to maintain a max
temperature of about 84 degrees Celsius
and it usually does so successfully in
the fire strike test but not always in
the torture test if you had doubts about
previous results because of how
stressful the torture test is realize
that fire strike is a gaming workload
this is gaming performance and so we'd
be dropping frequency and framerate even
during just playing a game that's
intensive enough CPU temperature in this
test was 45 degrees over ambient we
normally don't comment on CPU
temperature at all for this test but the
only other case that had a CV
temperature over 40 C with fire strike
was the wal-mart case
the SiO 600m is up there demonstrating
limitations with its design but it makes
up for it with the best GPU thermals
blender CPU rendering resulted in a CPU
temperature of 45 degrees Celsius higher
than any case except the Walmart one the
additional fan had negligible effect at
44 degrees Celsius over ambient with an
error here and this is just a cpu
workload so once again it's it's hot
even when only one component is doing
any real work GPU rendering averaged a
GPU temperature of 35 degrees Celsius
over ambiens but there are a couple of
cases on the chart that were hotter the
antec p8 again and the corsair spec for
the additional fan lowered temperature
by about one degree Celsius but that
isn't enough to beat out any of the
other cases noise levels for this case
aren't useful for strict comparison to
other cases on the chart because we had
to use a different power supply and the
power supply fan is front and center on
this case which strongly affects the
results under load the little enter max
fan brought the system up to 51 point 4
DBA the idle number is much closer to
being useful as a fair comparison to the
other charts because it's well it
behaves similarly to the corsair fan
that we normally use here in the power
supply we normally use so under idle
results are at 30 8.6 DBA which would
put it at just about average that's with
only one fan though stock positioned at
the very rear of the case and as far as
possible from the DB meter there's no
noise damping in this case and the
limited size and cooling capacity means
that without liquid cooling most builds
will have some small and noisy fans
running at a relatively high rpm
problems with this case you've seen a
lot of them already but here's the big
thing to get around a lot of the thermal
issues we saw you would have to change
parts down to smaller parts or go liquid
and brute force it and once you're going
towards small form-factor video cards
for example you're probably spending
more money you're dealing with more
limited options on the market and you
might as well just build an actual small
form-factor system at that point there's
a really small market of people who want
an ATX motherboard an SFF video card SFF
cooler and and for some reason still
have extra PCIe slots so that is a small
market and if you're starting to reduce
components
sighs just to make this case work
thermally you should just buy a smaller
case that's more appropriately designed
for a mini ITX system and has better air
flow channels setup so that's one of the
issues the upside that you get with this
thing is that it's small and at 60
dollars you might be able to justify
using the case if you can budget a bit
for a fan you should absolutely at least
buy one extra fan if you use lower power
consuming components if you are ok with
maybe brute forcing the CPU cooling with
a closed-loop liquid cooler it's not
going to perform as well as a CLC would
in a different case that's maybe
comparable in price like for example you
can get an H 500 from NZXT or an S 340
or you can get something like the RL 0-6
for reasonably cheap pretty close to
this price point all those things would
do better than this thermally they're a
bit larger though and that's the
downside the other downside though is
brute forcing by liquid it's still not
as good as using that same cooler in a
better design case but it won't throttle
so you can make it work it's just you
start spending enough money extra to
make this case work well that you really
might as well just start with a better
case and other than all of that the
video cards are still kind of going to
be problematic if they're anything even
like mid-range or higher and because you
start running into issues where there's
just they generated enough heat and
there's nowhere for the heat to go once
it's created and depending on which way
the fins are oriented if they are
horizontal this way in the case you're
venting air slightly out of the case
which is good and then the rest of its
going to go hit a power supply or going
to be recirculated I'll spray it like we
saw in a lot of our tests with extra
intake fan so that's another problem if
they are oriented the other way
going into the case so you have a
vertical orientation on the fins then
the air will follow that fin path and
hit the side panel at which point it
again will get recirculated it doesn't
really have anywhere to go
so that's the downside of a small case
like this it has all the other
disadvantages of small form-factor cases
it's just kind of generally fiddly to
work with if you need to move stuff
round it's not particularly easy to do
compared to a larger case that's fine if
you know what you're getting yourself
into it's just that being an ATX board
supporting case you don't necessarily
expect those same limitations cable
management is not bad really but that
was primarily because we were using a
small small form-factor power supply in
order to accommodate the video card you
shouldn't buy a video card that's larger
than reference size you probably
shouldn't be getting a car that's longer
than 10 to 10.5 inches across the case
because then you'll run into issues with
a lot of the power supplies air coolers
and even cooler master in its own guide
for this case says quote thermal
performance is dependent on the builds
itself well of course that's why case
testing is so difficult to do properly
because it's the least scientific of all
testing but we tried really hard to make
this case not throttle and it was
difficult you have to start spending a
lot in fan cost just to make it work so
if you're using really low end parts and
you want a case that's kind of
disproportionately priced to your low
end parts it's not terrible it is small
you just you need to use stuff that's
low TDP low power draw otherwise it's
gonna get kind of hot because even in
fire strike which is a gaming workload
it's not some insane torture workload on
the CV on the GPU it's a gaming workload
even and fire strike we were seeing
issues with GP down clocking and
excessive temperatures so this is it's
an attempt at a sort of small
form-factor ATX case we give
coolermaster credit for finding a
creative way to reuse the tooling keep
the cost down and fit an ATX set of
components into a small box but this
isn't something we can really recommend
trite now there are better options in
the mid tower size you'll end up being
maybe a couple inches taller
maybe another two inches in that
direction and you end up with a case
that's significantly better and it'll
cost about the same so unless you really
really need this case we can't strongly
recommend it and if you do want to buy
it
for the sighs then just make sure you're
also budgeting for fans and think kind
of think hard about the other components
you're using consider that you might be
at a higher noise level consider that
you might want to brute-force with
liquid and then it can all work out so
yeah that's that's kind of it for this
one at this point if you're going to be
fitting the builds of the case then also
consider just using a different case is
what it comes down to so sorry this one
wasn't better we know there was a lot of
interest in the queue 500l because of
that interest from you all on Twitter
and YouTube we we tried to make it work
but we couldn't it's just it doesn't get
a recommendation right now as always you
