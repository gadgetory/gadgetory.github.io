donna and we are here at the thermaltake
suite at CES 2014 right now we're
looking at one of their new cases this
is an urban T 81 and the big deal here
is that it fits a lot inside but it's
not a super tower like the 900 d or
something like that which we covered
last year link below if you need it so
the tau 1 this is a fully tricked-out
version of it we have a stock version
that we're going to move to next and
here you can see that it's got a full
custom open loop cooling design and it
will actually totally impractical for an
everyday user but just for fun we've got
a 4 20 millimeter radiator in the front
and and then we've got you can fit a 420
on the top up to and then you can fit
normal 141 20 everywhere else for the
most part so very easy to liquid cool
from what we've been told you can see
here it has hinging doors with a lock in
the center and this is a this is the
demo model so i think we're pulled apart
here right now so I've got hinting doors
with the lock moving over to the stock
version so you can see what it actually
ships like it comes stock with 2 200
millimetres fans in the front 200 in the
top and a 140 in the rear so we have
intake exhaust exhaust and then another
point to note here is the drive base
system you can see the scaffolding is
railed sort of like some of the newer
cases which means that you can pull
these clusters of drives out pretty
easily if you have no use for them and
you can also move them around if you
want to mount the hard drive vertically
which we will look at at the in the v70
one case in a second so MSRP for these
is 190 and and this is definitely a
pretty competitive price right now the
other suggestion is to look at the RV 02
which is a very high performing 90
degree mount case but definitely keep an
eye out for this and now we're going to
move over to the V 71 so now we're at
the v 71 this is pretty similar to the
the other case we just looked at except
it's got a larger window on the side
panel here instead of the hinged doors
and
the actual exterior of the chassis is a
little bit more stylized it's got these
holes punched through it everywhere the
drive cages on this one on the rear side
you can mount a hard drive vertically so
if you want to do that you can pretty
easily in the cable just manage straight
down as you would expect cable
management depth on both of these cases
is more than enough I don't have an
exact number for you right now but
there's a punch out on the rear side the
right panel of the case so you can close
it a little bit easier with the 24-pin
connector stacked with six pin
connectors so that is the v70 one this
one MSRP is 160 and and like I said
pretty much everything's the same as our
other case except it's a little bit
different looking and the hard drive
mount is on the rear or on the right
side panel so that's the thermaltake

will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
