I'm with an tech right now just want to
show everybody our newest cases the jack
700 will be launching it very very soon
what's fantastic about this case is it
really has everything you're looking for
in a gaming case you're going to have
USB 3.0 it's going to come stock with
three fans and not just n 3 and any
three fans you're going to have to 140 s
on top 1 120 in the rear the entire case
is solidly constructed out of metal even
the face plates are completely matte of
metal it's got a fan filter in the front
and it's got 2 120's in the front
another one on the side panel ok so
everything is to list the only time you
ever need a screw drivers when you're
stalling your motherboard on top of that
you can see we've got these tools things
here very nice alright and on top of
that you're going to add a fan
controller up here this entire case has
everything you're going to need so if
you just if you can think of what you
need as far as a gamer it's probably
gonna be in here what's most surprising
to everybody is the price point you're
going to get all the solid construction
all the fans all the fan controls and
fan filters for 59 99 that's MSRP so
thank you so much i hope to see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
