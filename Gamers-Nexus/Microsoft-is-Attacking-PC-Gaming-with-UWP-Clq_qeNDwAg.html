it was that parasitic entanglement of
PTSD inducing software purpose-built to
drive legitimate game buyers to piracy
gfwl clung to its life as an early scout
SCV might or Starcraft 2 at all for that
matter and the games for Windows Live
lived a relatively short life thankfully
but each day of its existence felt like
eternity spent in a quagmire haunted by
the crushed souls of developers
pressured into marketing deals with
Microsoft who all watched an abject
horror as their games received lashings
for interminable crashes and login bugs
mercifully it was killed put down and
leaving developers to scramble and
update a few good legacy games and
Street Fighter Batman in dirt 3 included
to work without the gfwl lifeline if you
could even call it that to begin with
we thought it was dead for good but
Microsoft's newest incarnation of
marketing doublespeak calls for a new
era of quote unified gaming between
consoles and PCs which means only one
thing for PC gamers restrictions and
this is a common buzzword for these
companies who think they're doing great
things for PC gamers by quote unquote
unifying the platforms but that's not
really what PC gamers want it's only
what people who sell things want and
that's fine it's all based in capitalism
anyway they need money to make these
games to make their platforms but it's
got to be done in a way that is
agreeable with the PC gaming culture and
that's what we've observed with
Microsoft's announcements over the past
few weeks like the fine brothers
attempting to trademark the word react
and thinking that they were doing great
things and changing the world Microsoft
doesn't quite seem to understand just
why their self aggrandized attempt to
quote-unquote unify and better gaming
scares so many PC enthusiasts they're
just oblivious and they haven't learned
a damn thing from the decaying corpse of
Windows live in the next cubicle over
here's what's happening Microsoft's
Windows Store featured in Windows 8 and
now prominently in Windows 10 makes an
attempt at recreating the mobile app
buying experience but for desktop
devices the store is now being leveraged
as a direct competitor to valve steam in
some ways
and even promises exclusive titles like
quantum break which has effectively been
sentenced to death to buy at Windows
Store exclusive launch and other titles
in the near future in the immediate
future Gears of War Ultimate Edition
will also ship via Windows Store
including Windows 10 as a requirement
for play and then tomb raider rise of
the Tomb Raider just shipped on Windows
Store and steam at the same time and
that might not be so bad after all
EAS got its own origin platform and many
of its titles are exclusive to origin
CD Projekt RED the CEO actually owns
good old games and The Witcher 3 has
exclusivity on GOG galaxy but none of
these titles do some of the
short-sighted things that Microsoft does
with currently available games on the
Windows Store certain game settings are
wholly inaccessible and immutable
including vsync which is forced on and
this means that users of free sync and
gsync displays must forgo their
cutting-edge expensive monitor
technology yes even free sync does add a
bit of overhead for validation and they
have to forego this tech in favor of
Microsoft's vision for PC gaming which
is apparently vsync for reasons unknown
to humankind other than perhaps utter
incompetence the store also doesn't use
executable files or exp s as we all know
them and instead opts for a special UWP
framework file and critically this means
that control panels from GPU vendors as
one point can't tap into the game and
make setting specific tweaks and video
control panel and AMD Radeon settings
are included in this unable to see the
uwp format is a playable game and this
means that their in-game displays don't
work as they plainly don't understand
what the process is or that it is even a
game to begin with fraps shadowplay and
peripheral macro software for your mouse
or keyboard are part of this exclusion
and cannot talk to the game in normal
ways that you'd expect with an exe maybe
through Steam standalone or GOG or
otherwise and this means the head by
forcing this uwp framework if you're
playing a game that is exclusive to the
Windows Store you've instantly cut your
settings that you can tune including
vsync for again whatever reason that's
one of them even though most of us hate
for a great many of very valid reasons
and it also includes the restriction of
not being able to use those overlays so
if you do like overlays or you like
gameplay capture you've now got a fight
with the Windows Store and it's uwp
framework in order to try and do
anything like that
and here Microsoft thinks its unifying
the console and PC experience it feels
like an episode of the office it's just
painfully awkward as we watch an
over-the-top character try to relate
with normal people one of the game
development studios that has experience
working with the uwp framework mixes I
think is it's NI xx es the folks who
ported rise of the Tomb Raider indicated
that vsync and other settings
restrictions within the Windows Store
version of games our limitations of the
uwp framework ie Microsoft's doing were
you to buy rise of the Tomb Raider on
Steam where it's available at the exact
same price as on Windows Store you'd own
something infinitely more expandable
that retains compatibility with the
screen overlay software settings tuning
and modding especially modding is a big
point by the way a lot of mods will not
work without their normal exe launching
platform and Microsoft is trying to
blockade users into a sandbox where in
Microsoft's thinking the users can't
harm themselves and that's not how PC
gaming has ever worked and had Mike
yourself to learn to anything from
previous restrictions levied by itself
and other Studios it no it's not how PC
gaming will ever work I think there's
more to it than these restrictions -
there's got to be a reason Microsoft's
doing this and mark my words
I think these restrictions inevitably
bear with them microtransaction heavy
stores that attempt to monetize simple
changes or mods that be free through any
other normal framework or platform
that's where I think this could be going
so as Microsoft continues to expand its
quote-unquote ecosystem that's a huge
marketing word that everyone loves to
use as they expand their ecosystem that
attempts to unify Xbox and Windows
gamers we can only hope that developers
don't sign exclusivity deals with
Microsoft's embarrassingly misguided
gaming plat
form Microsoft if anyone there's
listening start by ditching your
cumbersome framework allow normal
program wrappers structures whatever and
grant the same level of control as would
be found within any reasonable game
distribution software on PC and I'm
including steam EA origin GOG galaxy and
others in that list Windows Store is as
far from reasonable as possible it is
basically an incarnation or
reincarnation of games for Windows Live
which should have remained dead and
buried as for all of you watching our
recommendation is simple avoid the
Windows Store whenever possible as
anyone who considers themselves a PC
enthusiasts will face only frustration
with at the very least the settings and
control panel limitations not to mention
API and operating system requirements
dx12 and Windows 10 in cases where they
might not otherwise make sense that's
all for this one subscribe for more

directly and thanks for watching as
always we do love making this kind of
content I'll see you all next time
I need to go scream into a different
black hole because YouTube wasn't enough
and I know this isn't actually going to
change Microsoft's opinion that they are
the best thing ever to happen to gaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
