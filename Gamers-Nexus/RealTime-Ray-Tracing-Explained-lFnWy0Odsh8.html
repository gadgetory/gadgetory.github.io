at Nvidia and we've done a few talks
with Tom before so today I think we're
gonna talk about about r-tx and rate
racing in general as a concept so r-tx
obviously I think announced at GDC GDC
that's right explored more here at GTC
and let's do a let's do kind of the
elevator pitch okay Bret for ray-tracing
so the basics before that this video is
brought to you by EVGA and the X 299
dark motherboard for the Intel high-end
desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is one of
the only mother boards on the market
with proper vrm cooling we've tested
this and found a significant performance
increase over those without active
cooling on the prm's
this board was used in our recent
attempt to set a top 10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x29 dark at the link in the description
below
you're telling me before we went on
camera this has been the Holy Grail
since it is it's before you were born
absolutely well before even Brian was
born right yeah so ray tracing is is
actually changing from well I'll call
like an artistic artistic version of
creating images to more of a physics
version of creating images so today with
rendering not many people know but most
of that is kind of like an artist
painting a painting there's lots of
heuristics and you know you do things
like texture colors and what you're
trying to do is find a mathematically
simple way to generate an image that's
pretty compelling so you have geometric
models you have shader programs but all
these things have no connection to the
real world right ray tracing is
completely different and by the way that
old method of kind of using computer
approximations has artifacts you know
things like the shadows don't look right
or things Sparkle there if they're
getting better and they've always been
good and and they're great for gaming
but they're not real ray tracing in
contrast is trying to do a physical
simulation of light and the way to think
about it is you know we live in a world
where light bounces all over the place
and it hits on an object and bounces
around diffusing deflecting subsurface
scattering that's all kinds of stuff
right but eventually one ray of light
makes it into your eye and and hits your
retina and that's what we perceive as
vision so what ray tracing is all about
is pretending that you're kind of
modeling how a retina works and you
project forward into the into the scene
trying to figure out what other rays
have hit the object that's lighting your
eye so ray tracing is all about the
physics of light and when you do that
you get rid of all this artistic
interpretation that happens with
traditional renderings yeah so it's very
it's very much the way movies do
generating CGI and now what's really
different is that we're able to do that
in real time using r-tx right yeah well
we we've done some ray tracing renders
and not real time right and to get
everyone up to kind of a an example for
scale before this video started we'll
have about a two-second intro animation
that rolls that intro has some ray
tracing in it and it's I think it took
us over two weeks to render the two
seconds right 120 frames Wow so is that
the logo spinning cut that is yeah you
know yeah so obviously that is not a not
great for real time no coming down to
real-time then I guess for RTX do you
have any idea how many how many samples
were taking or how many rays are being
traced yeah well it's all different
depending on you know the the platform
that you're running on but the key thing
to RTX is we have to make some
simplifications with even our next
generation hardware Volta it's still not
enough to simulate every ray I mean
obviously we live in a continuous world
there's there's too many rays to
simulate so you have to kind of have a
heuristic that simplifies the problem a
little bit and then you need techniques
to make that simplified ray tracing
experiment look good so we have filters
that are built into our game works that
effectively make simplified ray tracing
or sparse ray tracing look really good
and that's the key as technology gets
faster as our GPUs get faster we'll be
able to do more sophisticated ray
tracing with more Ray's and get more
phone arista photorealistic over times
so right now it's all I think all the
demos have been done on Titan B's
revolted anyway yeah is there a is there
a hardware or architectural limitation
that prevents it from right on Pascal or
is it is it just a raw speed thing yeah
it's it's a speed thing I mean there are
there are Hardware widgets inside of
Volta that accelerate ray tracing
you know you can you can do software
back offs on older generation GPUs but
they're they're a lot slower so at the
end of the day real-time ray tracing is
going to be reliant upon optimized
hardware to accelerate that search of
the space was was Volta built
specifically with this in mind of
accelerating ray tracing or was that was
another I product one of many things
that I had to does well right so ray
tracing for us has always been something
that we're super passionate about super
interested in and it takes many
generations many years and you know this
like from our comput computer you've got
to start somewhere and we're gonna make
it better over time and Volta was the
place where it really got its first big
investment and it's gonna get you know
increasingly competent increasingly
better over time across more of our
product lines when when dealing with Ray
J's and then so we've talked about
sampling so how many samples you do how
many rays you trace there's also
denoising right so what why do we need
denoising again it's about that
sparseness of current hardware
capability so if we could simulate every
ray accurately in a game you would need
anything knowing you would have a
completely continuous image generated
from ray tracing but the truth is today
on our hardware that's too expensive so
what we actually do is generate a sparse
image and that has little pops of
simulated pixels adjacent to things that
didn't get simulated so what the
denoising does is runs deep learned
filters on that to make it look a little
bit more natural and that denoising
technology is tightly coupled into you
know what's your algorithm what's your
what's your technique for picking race
this in right reflections and
refractions were also a big part of some
of the demos yeah what mates
let's talk kind of a general concept
level on a hardware side what makes it
difficult for GPUs to deal with
reflections refractions or like we saw
the one demo the Star Wars demo where
you had sort of almost an infinity
mirror effect right guns reflecting off
the body off the gun yep so what makes
that specifically difficult well it's
really hard to simulate unless you're
simulating the light reflections itself
the truth is on GPUs today with
traditional renderers
you're not really simulating reflections
you're generating a texture and then
you're warping the texture all at once
and you're kind of painting it onto a
surface so that you can kind of get the
impression of a reflection right but
what's really hard about that is you
have to you can only do that kind of
with one immediate bounce if you start
thinking about things reflecting on
things reflecting on things then with
traditional renderers you're generating
these these images and then you're kind
of transforming them on the surfaces and
then re transforming that thing onto the
next thing so it's the order of what is
bouncing on a lot that gets very very
complicated so that that's why it
doesn't normally look very good or do
very well on traditional renders ray
tracing is completely different because
it kind of goes backwards from your eye
and it says what is my eye seeing and
then what are the set of things that hit
that eye so you can actually accurately
calculate the the order that things are
getting lit so we have a scene with the
camera with the player and we have let's
say one source of light like direct
source of light the Sun or something
like that where we tracing rays from in
the sea and they is it coming straight
from the light source so the way to
think about it is to go from your eye
you're actually going just coming out of
the camera that yes so you say I don't
need to simulate every bit of light in
the scene what I really need to simulate
is what light is going to hit my eye and
so you start from there and say which
pieces of geometry are are relevant to
my current camera position and let's go
figure out the color of those things and
so now you know a collection of points
that need to get lit and you can see
what light sources are bouncing into
that thing and it's just this tree that
mushrooms out very quickly right here
refractions is there anything special
with refractions versus reflections and
it's all just physics right it's just
model the thing that you're you're
interacting with accurately so if you
have parameters built into your model
that affect how light transmission works
it all just works that's the best thing
about ray tracing you don't have to
special case everything you just sort of
build your your physical model
accurately and then the visual effect is
just a result of calculations and I
guess for the immediate future still
kind of using traditional techniques
raster
in conjunction with ray-tracing for
purposes of complexity I guess it's all
computation right so for the short time
being I think you're gonna see a lot of
hybrids where maybe global illumination
is done with traditional techniques and
then you could do shadows or reflections
or you know other other focused effects
using ray tracing and I think you'll see
those hybrids for some time before you
know we get to the point where our
hardware is more capable and you'll
you'll convert wholesale to a different
technique for current iterations of the
r-tx stuff I guess you guys working with
Microsoft for DirectX yes implementation
I saw there was is was there some Vulcan
news as well there's we did announce
anything but the way to think about RT X
is it's more of the layer that is the
Nvidia layer exposing our hardware
software capabilities up to AP aughts so
DirectX takes advantage of RT acts and
in the future other os's or other api's
could do similar stuff right what's
going on on the game engine side what
are the when you hand this off the epic
games what do they have to do for
implementation I suspect you know I'm
not really sure exactly what its gonna
do but obviously we're working very very
closely for ray tracing with all the
game engine guys and I suspect you'll
see adoption over time and we have game
works which is intended to deliver a
complete ray tracing solution to make it
easy for integration both into games and
game engines right cool
anything from all the coverage you've
seen of RT x ray tracing in general any
other key points you want to bring that
I think people have gotten wrong or have
overlooked I think everybody gets it
that it that it dramatically improves
the fidelity of names and it's it's new
and exciting it's kind of the Holy Grail
and to me it's just a question of how
much time is gonna happen before we
start seeing real games that are taking
advantage of it and we're doing
everything we can to accelerate that
obviously so the next step I guess is
getting it off of dgx requirements
basically right not to more consumer
hardware yeah I mean if we want to see a
big adoption of ray tracing technology
we need to get it out into them into
more platforms right right there'll be
the future that may be yeah you know
it's hard to say okay a lot of lot of
things going on there
cool well I guess we we might do some
additional conversation after this if
you find anything interesting here check
the article links Lee description below
I'll do follow-ups on any additional
questions people have in the comment
section if you have anything major and
thank you guys always Tom yeah right man
great see you soon we'll see you all
