the $180 570 X crystal with tempered
glass paneling and RGB LED fans on a
multi-function controller and the 270 R
a mid tower for $70 or 60 without the
window this review contains thermal
benchmarking at various rpms DBA noise
level testing and our new ambient case
time metric alongside the usual use of
insulation and quality review and as for
both cases before I get into that this
coverage is brought to you by a.m. these
are X 470 video card which we've
declared to be the best price
performance value in the less than $200
video card market - the link in the
description below lands to a couple of
our x4 70s and speaking of AMD Corsair
has adopted their naming scheme I know
hi everyone's made that joke but
seriously they have the 460 X that we
spoke about at PAX now there's the 570 X
and there's a 270 are those are the new
cases and for the run-through we're
starting with the Corsair Radeon 570 X
which is a count that would probably
confuse someone next year when the 570
exists in this custom animation that
gamers Nexus made we're showing them
explosion of the 570 X's tooling and
paneling the left right and front center
panels are all made of tempered glass
measuring four millimeters thick all
attached to the chassis structure with
four thumb screws per panel gaps in the
paneling make for an interesting visual
decision exposing the underlying
structure and relying on about a 0.6
inch gap on the sides of the front
intake for breathing for the fans put
that to the test in the thermal
benchmark that small space is
compensated for in theory with 3 120
millimeter RGB fans in the front which
we tested and found to max out at around
1500 to 1600 rpm each fan has two cables
one route to the rear side hub the other
route to the motherboard directly the
motherboard three pin connector provides
the power for the motor while the four
pin connector to the hub provides
communication with yet another hub this
one actually is more an SP RGB
controller and then three more cables
bridge this controller with the front
panel buttons providing a handful of
color speeds and modes that are manually
toggle through three buttons on the
front or on the back side of the case in
this regard the RGB fans are weaker than
some of the immediate competition
thermal takes new rain fans although
sort of playing to the clumsy software
are more configurable than what you'll
get with the coarser SP RGB fans and the
same is true for n ZX T's fans the air
fans they just have more options through
software but we'd be shocked of course
they weren't working on a similar
solution already to Corsairs credits
they are one of the only vendors
shipping with the RGB fans installed in
a case in this class anyway NZXT and
thermal takes are both presently
aftermarket solutions the 570 X's
Corsairs effort to attack both current
case trends in one go tempered glass and
RGB lights and in some ways the LEDs
feel a little bit unnecessary but I
suppose they're what sells today the
extra controllers and LEDs adds a cost
obviously and the case would be
perfectly suitable with just the glass
at a price reduction regardless let's
talk ease of installation the enclosure
uses a split-level motherboard tray
which is something I haven't talked
about since probably the NZXT H series
cases and this allows you to
theoretically more easily route the 8
pin EPS power cables it's got a couple
of cutouts on the top actually it's sort
of one long cutout because the tray
basically goes up and then over and in
the sort of main spot where you find an
EPS connector back left corner there's a
large cutout the smaller parts don't
really fit the cables that I had which
consequently are actually from a Corsair
power supply you could split the 8 pin
and a half into two four pins and wiggle
it through so it's it's an area where an
extra 1 millimeter or even half a
millimeter of extra depth in that hole
would allow for the cable to fit through
completely without issue and it is a
small gripe but at this point it is one
of the things that Corsair could improve
on installation of the board is easy
though it's a larger case with a lot of
room and that means plenty of working
area but the PSU shroud isn't removable
the 270 arm does however have a front
cover that prevents cables from sneaking
into visibility and the 570 X doesn't
really prevent the cables from slipping
out into the case where you can see them
the 570 X has a brilliant SSD
installation system and it's actually my
favorite feature of the case and the
best SSD installation I've seen it yet
no screws are required it's a
spring-loaded trap door that locks the
SSD into place quick and painless and
impossible to screw
the 270 are like v5 70 X also mounts its
SSD slides to the rear side of the
motherboard tray but uses a more
traditional set of screws to hold it all
in place and then the expansion slot
screws are a little annoying to access
in these cases they're not a straight
shot and could be fixed by cutting out
some of the material on the left side of
the frame or by exposing the screws
through the back of the case even
Rosewell gets this right with the
Cullinan or more appropriately their
supplier Jones boat gets a right NZXT
also gets this right both solutions
unlike coursers make it easy to deal
with larger video cards like Emma sized
gaming X again not a huge deal but also
it is these small things that count at
this point because most of the big stuff
was done right and has been done right
on these sort of name-brand cases for
quite some time now cable management on
each case is pretty similar by which I
mean largely unimaginative the five 70 X
is the only one that's a bit different
it has a cable management shroud on the
back side of the case that would be the
right side with the glass panel that
trout is secured by two thumb screws it
hides in theory the 24 pin and any other
cables that snake up the middle channel
of the case and out into the motherboard
area and it's a huge pain in the ass to
use that killed Hegeman shroud so I it's
there's not quite enough depth there to
accommodate a for example braided or
sleeved set of cables like Corsair zone
24 pin sleeved cables that we have with
the Corsair RM whatever power supply we
use for case testing it just barely fits
that so that is a bit of a problem I
think that could be done better it took
two people to screw that thing back down
because the cables barely fit in there
with the whole bundle all tied up and if
I were working on it alone I would have
just left the thing out because it was
not perfect so NZXT I think has Corsair
beat on this front and cable management
you'll hear me talk about that again in
a moment but at least it's an attempt
Corsair starting to try and do something
new with cable management I just don't
think that was the right thing for this
particular case something much simpler
like the plastic cable clamps on NZXT
s340 elite or velcro on the fantex cases
would be more accommodating to
thicker configurations when working with
cables that sort of stack atop each
other and it'd be a bit less intricate
in terms of the manufacturing in this
case that's a good thing besides the
sleeves cables look good and you're
probably going to have sleeves cables if
you're building in a $180 enclosure with
a glass panel on the right side of
course there may have NZXT routinely
defeated in cooling performance again
we'll see that soon but NZXT does rank
in with cable management from the s 340
onward that said we do like Corsairs
added cable pass throughs on the 270 r4
it's PCIe headers this is something that
we asked for on the 600 C and it does
allow direct access to the GPU so good
on them for adding that we finally
updated our case testing platform from
the ancient 35 70 K bench to the first
bench that gamers axe is officially
built as a standalone component bench
solution so we have a new one it's
detailed in the article link to the
description below along with all the
methodology if you want to read about
what components were used coolers all
that stuff it is down there in the link
and the fact that we're moving to a new
case bench does mean that all previous
results are not comparable to these so
you can't look at previous results and
compare CPU or GPU thermals with the
ones from this system because they are
completely different parts in this case
we've also slightly overclocked the 6700
K by about 10% in terms of the other
methodology items that you should know
if you haven't seen these videos before
we measure ambient temperature in the
test environment with two thermocouples
one it both ours k-type thermocouple as
they attach to a thermocouple reader
they log every second that we use a 264
to monitor the CPU temperature every
second and then we use a DES also for
the GPU temperature with GPZ for
validation and run some automated tests
in the background that completely self
executes so there's no chance for human
error and then when all that data is
collected we create a delta value so you
get your delta T over ambient and that's
what tells us because ambient can
fluctuate from second second it gives us
a good look at case performance when
accounting for ambient one other thing
to note our methodology is accurate to a
point of plus or minus 0.5 Celsius and
again complete testing method
in the description below let's start
with the CPU temperatures the 570 X at
1550 ish rpm is unsurprisingly the best
cooled enclosure on the newly assembled
KS bench and that's because we've only
got the cases that you see here which
are largely competitors in the
tempered-glass arena or at least the
large window side panel arena it's large
and it's got three intake fans the 570 X
and that positions at the top these
charts with its max fan rpm 450 point
two Celsius delta T over ambient or
about 2.6 idle dropping the 570 axis fan
speed to 1050 rpm increases our
temperature by nearly 2 Celsius load but
the noise benefit is mostly worth it
here the temperature gain strictly
looking at the CPU is not significant to
the CPUs performance but it is a
significant factor when considering GPU
performance
moving on to Corsair 60 to $70 case the
270 are at 1300 rpm max fan speed
produces a fifty two point eight C load
temperature for the CPU 270 are only has
two fans one in the front one in the
rear and uses the most basic intake
exhaust setup that has existed for ages
and rpm change to roughly 1050 increases
our temperature by about to see again
and on GX ESS 340 elites is considerably
worse than the 570 X when both are at
their max fan RPMs this isn't
necessarily significant for the CPU but
as I've said that will prove useful to
look at when considering GP boosts
performance look at that in a moment -
regardless the CPU temperature is about
50 5.8 Celsius at load resultant of NZXT
T's decision to use strictly exhaust
fans in the top and the rear of the s
340 elite they're doing this for dust
reasons but it's really not good for
thermal reasons Roseville's Cullinan
isn't much better and that's with for
fans but not all fans are made equal
obviously in rows wells are more
suffocated in the front of the case than
the others but then there's the in win
303 which we tested with its stock
configuration that is to say 0 fans with
our new test bench it's overclocked and
our axial fan GPU rather than the radial
blower fan the in wind 303 heats up
rapidly and incinerates components
without any of its intake fans present
because it ships with none and that's
what we tested the CPU is hitting 100 C
GPU thermal throttles at 81 C and
when looking at non Delta values the
case is obviously best paired up with a
fan or two if you purchase it so when
considering the price seventy to
seventy-five dollars you've got to count
the price of two fans
moving on to GPU temperatures we see at
the top row as well as Cullinan
leverages its rear exhaust fan to help
dispense some of the heat that collects
around the back plate of the game in Ex
this brings the Cullen Enza temps down
to 49.1 nine Celsius showing the
advantage of a dual fan axial cooling
solution in a standard ATX case our
previous case bench used a blower fan
and reference cooler which really
suffered in some scenarios but it was
also useful in others like small boxes
we use firm mark for these burn ins
which abuses the VRMs to generate
significant heat this test approach
means that it is important for cases to
be able to dissipate the heat emission
that radiates off of the back of the PCB
which an exhaust fan supports that's
what you're seeing here anyway with the
fixed GPU fan speed and firm are burning
the VRMs while prime95 is going on we
see a forty nine Celsius delta T for the
Cullinan five seventy x the corsair case
that were reviewing is about 51 c 270
are also reviewing is at about 52 C and
the S 340 elite is at about 54 C we're
seeing a three Celsius Delta between the
570 X at 1550 and 1050 rpm at about 21
to 22 Celsius roughly for ambient
temperatures and you'll get an idea of
the GP diode temperature in a cool house
where at your own if you want a more
accurate measurement our next chart is
ambient case temperature we decided to
add this chart after running extreme
burnin scenarios on the EVGA FTW cards
which we'll be publishing this week in
those tests we found that an increase in
ambient temperature of around 40 Celsius
had a significant impact on the vrm
cooling in a way that wasn't reflected
with a 22 Celsius open air temperature
to this end we've learned that ambient
case temperature not just diode
temperatures are important to the
cooling of components which can only be
measured by direct thermocouples and not
by software again like the V RMS or vram
the v so Dax blows the s 340 elites away
with a 10 Celsius difference in case
ambient temperature at least where we
measure it and as we've learned with
EVGA that's a significant difference
efficiency loss and thermal Headroom
limitations on the card come into play
at this point to 7-yard does well the
Cullinan is
okay but it's still suffocated a bit by
the intake and we position our case
ambient probe just for notes about three
inches from that intake fan in the front
so that is between the cpu GPU fan and
the case fans is sort of triangulated
between the three of them that's also a
hot spot for the s through 40 elite
which will soon be reviewing in a
separate video
moving on to noise briefly these tests
are taken with decibel meter at 20
inches from the front of the case the
noise floor of the room is about 26 DBA
and we take a delta to get our numbers
on this chart keep in mind that decibels
are logarithmic so the Delta noise is
not calculated the same way as
temperatures it's not subtractive these
tests are conducted with the GPU fan at
50% CPU fan at 1,100 rpm which is the
speed it uses for all our tests and the
270 are at 10:50 rpm is the quietest
thanks to its usage of only two fans
with one stuck behind the front panel
that eats noise s340 elite is next and
about equal to the 270 are when it's two
fans are also at ten fifty rpm we then
move to the 570 X at 1050 see a 35 DBA
output pretty similar to the first two
and Roseville's Cullinan and it's for
fans at 36 DBA thanks to a low rpm
that's followed by V 270 our 1300 rpm or
36.6 DBA s 340 elite runs louder at 1300
rpm and part of that is because both of
its fans are directly against the top
and rear panels and they're more exposed
to the outside in that way they're also
just a bit louder at 38.1 DBA the 570 X
at 1550 rpm is nearly a perceptual 2 X
increase in volume from the 270 are at
10:50 rpm but it's still manageable for
reference the average phone's text tone
is about 80 decibels for max volume
based on our Luce tests there you have
it and conversation normal conversation
at about 3 feet is some around 65
decibels let's start the conclusion with
the 270 our this is the easier case to
discuss 270 are at $60 price point for a
non windowed variant is one of the
easiest pickups at its price $70
alternative starts to enter into
competition with the launch shredder to
NZXT s340 the cooler master master box
and the fractal defined s the n1 303
sort of counts but you'd have to buy a
few fans that instantly puts the 303
close to the 400 C in price
we like the 270 are even at $70 where
the comp
it's tougher it's a good solution 270
our cools adequately on all fronts and
is relatively quiet even at its higher
rpms there's a good chance that your
components will be louder anyway and
it's also easy to build in which is one
of the most important things with a
cheap case other than the small gripes
with expansion slot screws NZXT does a
better job with cable management and
it's $70 s 314 $100 340 elite then both
of these but Corsairs case does better
with cooling so to each their own
advantages and then for the harder one
to review the 570 X I've not I'm not
sure what to think of it really from an
aesthetic standpoint I don't really
stick to testing and data it's a lot
easier for me to work with but this is
the kind of thing where you got to look
at it and decide for yourself I've asked
several people what they think I have
heard from Andrew the man behind the
camera that sort of looks like a modern
building construction style which yet
sort of does we've heard I've heard two
opinions on the LEDs they are
unnecessary and they are necessary and
personally it does sort of look like
coarser just was like let's slap a bunch
of glass to a frame and that's what they
did but you know if that looks good or
not is up to you not up to me so I'll
leave that part to you guys as far as
the performance the noise the
temperatures are all more than adequate
for the 570 X and they're fine on the
270 are really no big complaints there
the dark bass 900 B quiets case comes to
mind that's sort of a direct competitor
at least in price this the cheaper one
anyway $200 ish and then you could also
look at course there's older 760 t if
you don't like the tempered or the glass
on all sides and you'd rather have
something like an acrylic or
polycarbonate then those large full
window options that are more typical in
their design would be a good thing to
consider at $160 rather than 180 for the
glass thermal takes P 3 and P 5 worth
looking at in a similar price range if
you want something wall-mounted
something a bit unique and there plenty
of other options out there so plenty to
work with the 570 X is pretty easy to
build in same with a 270 are the 270 are
I think is the easier one to recommend
here because it is a decent deal and as
far as the 570 X your deal
with a couple of controllers one of
them's a dumb quote/unquote dumb
controller which is what handles your
RGB functions your modes for the fans
and the speeds for the fans the first
unit we received had issues with
lighting not really working actually
none of the modes worked but the
replacement controller did resolve those
issues and Corsair assures me that
they've never seen this before which of
course we hear all the time but in this
case I do actually kind of believe that
because I looked around and I couldn't
find anything so I think that was a
one-off issue I wouldn't really worry
about that too much and obviously if it
is an issue for some reason they should
replace it under normal warranty but
when it does work it's okay if you don't
want software to control your fans I
guess that's the way to do it so as
always article for more if you want more
