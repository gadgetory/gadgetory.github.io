against each other they are rising
integrated heat spreaders to both copper
as stated previously
this one's just nickel plated copper not
really a big difference between them it
was about two degrees at the end of the
day with tasking which is barely outside
of test error and variance so the
question we had and a lot of you had as
well was where is the two degree
difference is it really just because
it's bare copper rather than nickel
plated or did rocket Kools do something
different with this like increase the
surface area or something
and probably a lot of the answer comes
down to just lapping the surface which
is kind of an old thing to do it's not
really worth doing in general
but we're gonna try it out cuz we
haven't done it for a rise in GPU yet so
this is a rise in APU it's an r3 2200 G
we've already done thermal tests on it
now we're going to basically send down
the surface and the point of that is not
to just expose bare copper the point is
more to flatten it to get as many of the
imperfections out of it as we can so
that when we have thermal compound
between this and the cooler there are
fewer microscopic imperfections to fill
so that's what we're doing today before
that this video is brought to you by the
EVGA X 299 dark motherboard the one that
we recently used to take a top 5 world
record for fire strike overclocking
results the EVGA x2 99 dark board is one
of the best we've used presently in this
current generation and it has a coupon
code of gamers nexus for a savings of
$75 off for us customers expires on May
31st you've been interested in the X 299
dark with its actual vrm heatsink and
actual vrm cooling capabilities that was
a good time to grab it use code gamers
next as that check out click the link in
the description below
the approach to this is pretty simple
basically I'm going to tape some
sandpaper to the table and then send
down the service and we're just gonna
keep going until it's really shiny
copper it'll take a while probably so
we'll end up time lapsing it most likely
but the the plan is to use 600 grit to
start with if that's too much we'll find
out pretty quickly
800 would be my alternative and then
we're gonna go up to 1,200 1,500 2,000
maybe 3,000 probably maybe do a wet sand
in there to once some of the paper is
worn down enough that's functionally a
higher value grit anyway so start with
600 the trick that I'm going to use here
is rather than take this and try to rub
it on a small surface area we're just
gonna tape it to the table and you've
got the GN mod mat under it so that's
definitely not going anywhere the tables
gonna wobble as it does but so this is
your last look at the face of it before
we get started
rise in our 320 200 G the imperfections
here that we're getting rid of are not
something that any of us would really be
able to see without a microscope or
magnifying glass but that's what we're
trying to get rid of we're probably not
gonna bother with the backside just the
front I think so let's see how long this
will take
oh man that's cool that's pretty cool
dan the lettering gone I almost want to
test it right there
like how much basically the test would
be how much does Andy's laser etching
impact the performance the answer is not
at all but that looks pretty cool
starting to see some copper at the edges
there see that so originally I have to
keep an eye on this that hole which will
see if it goes away
that's the original bottom corner so the
word Rison will be face up in this
current orientation which for
note-taking purposes it's going to be
the this is more for my own information
but if you need it to in case you sand
away the hole the hole is to the right
of the letters AMD on the inside when
the letters AMD are right side up when
they're legible
so it's to the right of that D
let's keep going with 600 before we move
on this is gonna be the roughest grit we
use for now definitely getting some
copper going through this is faster
still 600 just got a new sheet
definitely the edges are standing away
first so if you've ever looked at a
rhizome IHS from Andy not the rocky cool
ones they kind of look like a cylinder
or a circle push down on the middle of
them the outer corners are always kind
of chamfered and what we're doing right
now apparently is sending those off
that's why you're seeing copper there
first because they're higher than the
middle of the IHS which is just kind of
an A in the manufacturing thing so
that's what you're seeing right now is
we're seeing everything gets sanded down
to an equal level still pretty scratchy
on the surface but there is some copper
shine through in the middle and as we
keep going we'll move to finer grit just
sand it off some of my skin
yeah a little bit of copper in the
middle so think what we're going for is
just visible copper everywhere right
that that paper so use now it's
basically become like a grit eight
hundred or a thousand let's try one more
of these see how far we can get that's
cool okay really get in there now so
we're gonna have the middles middles
exposing earliest so that was the
highest along with the edges which I
guess makes senses is where the die
contact is and it's being exposed
basically where the inner plate is at
the same place
one more spot I want to get the beacon
copper and then we'll change the grid
how the blood in that one
one more one more sheet where's that
motherboard vice.com quote I bled for
this thing computer building so
hard it's the hardest thing ever and it
hurts anyone who hasn't seen our
response to motherboard YouTube likes to
recycle it sometimes that's looking
pretty good
sorry there's your copper IHS there's
the rocket : which is actually now it's
roughly the same size if there's a
different size it's very very very small
amounts I think I maybe should have
started with like a 400 or 300 or
something just so I could have sanded my
skin off down to the bone instead but
also this would have been faster one
wet-sand pass before we move up the next
grit have I mentioned before that the
mod mat is pretty water resistant
oh no I accidentally got water on my mod
mat what do I do
check that oh that's actually pretty
cool though
looking good very smooth and polished
see all that copper dust and the water
around it it's definitely getting rid of
more and more copper starting to smooth
it out I think we've pretty much exposed
the copper under the nickel plating at
this point nickel plating is gone
so at this point it's probably time to
move to a grit 1200 I think because this
is getting very smooth now basically
sending it to a polish in between each
pass you can got some copper copper dust
on the mat okay so 1200 next and if you
do want one of the mats which is
evidently as we're we're learning with
you pretty what a resistant
you got a store that gamers extra
thought net and pick them up they're
currently on backorder if you place your
order at the time this video goes live
or shortly thereafter you will
definitely get one in the next
production run after that kind of
depends we sell out pretty quickly so
you'll want to place one sooner rather
than later to make sure you get one for
the next run which will go out within
the next couple of weeks so there's some
like brown drops of liquid around to the
side
that's not drawing blood from me that's
actually well it's probably not
it's just copper dust so 1200 grit so
again our goal here isn't to take off
all of it like just hand it all the way
down our goal is to smooth it a lot so
we're going 1202 I think 1,500 to 2,000
maybe 3,000 I do have some here I just
don't know if we're gonna want to go
that far
certainly would polish it further though
look wow this table doesn't shake I
don't know why everyone complains about
the table
where's the dot I'm glad they took a
note of where it was supposed to align I
think the dots gone
dan that's getting some polish you see
that mostly towards me right in this
corner over here I seem to be putting
more pressure on that side
this is super fine like check that trade
out 3000 is crazy okay here we go
polishing passes on 3000
hopefully it's sanded down it off at
this point wait this is this is not good
hang on check out the instructions can
you see that applications for high-gloss
polishing of final finishes on wood and
automobiles nowhere does it say
integrated heat spreaders
that's pretty shiny sure it could be
polished more I took it to like a
jeweler or something and asked them to
do it but that's pretty good I think for
our test we'll see how it does it's
certainly very smooth at this point I
mean we've done six hundred six hundred
wet 1200 1200 wet 2000 thousand wet and
three thousand and there's three
thousand is probably turning into four
thousand at this point Wow that's
getting very very shiny so there's a
polished IHS for now I could probably do
a bit more with proper polishing tools
or something but it's functionally a
mirror right now so I want to go ahead
and test this it looks pretty damn good
so we're gonna test this and then we're
gonna come back in the same video and
show you the results and and we'll see
if it makes up the two degree difference
which was pretty close to margin of
error anyway although just outside of it
so we'll see if it makes it up and
competes directly with the rocket cool
IHS I will say this one involved less
blood but that's the fun part so well
you know how it goes right now let's get
into the charts as always go to the
testing methodology section linked in
the article in the description below if
you want to know how we tested this
stuff I actually don't know the results
presently but I will when I'm talking in
a second previously we were hitting 26
point three degrees Celsius over ambient
for the rocket cool IHS you can check
our previous video on that if you want
more data on how that performed
thermally that was without any silicone
adhesive and was our best thermal result
the stock risin IHS without adhesive and
without lapping held a 28 degree results
which is just barely outside of our
error margins for this testing
functionally they're the same results
although measurably different the stock
IH asked with silicone adhesive which
creates a bit of a Z height gap that
needs to be filled with more Tim under
the IHS measured at thirty two point six
degrees over ambient and complete stock
was 47 degrees over a mid and that's
again for the our 320 200 G which is a
non soldered and the CPU for our new
test with the lab ths we ran three
test passes with newly applied conductor
not liquid metal for each pass which
will link below and averaged at about
twenty seven point five degrees we're
within error margins for either flanking
results and so can say that we've lost
measurement resolution as to the
differences between them it looks like
logically the results indicate we can
get toward the rocket cool yhs thermally
with lapping it took more than twenty
dollars of sandpaper to get there and so
exceeded the cost of rocking coals IHS
and also took an hour of time but you
can certainly push closer to its
performance
perhaps with even more polish we'd be at
equivalence for now the differences are
outside of our measurement resolution so
all that work was basically for what we
expected which is roughly one degree of
difference maybe a bit more a bit less
depending because we ran multiple test
passes and at the end of the day it was
just between the ROC equal HS and the
stock one with no silicon adhesive so
thermally they're kind of functionally
identical or at least they are outside
of our measurement resolution the the
difference between this and this one we
can't measure a difference reliably with
our resolution so not very exciting but
basically if you wanted to get more or
less the rocket collage as performance
you could do it if you have sandpaper
lying around already that's probably the
best approach because otherwise if
you're buying sandpaper you're spending
basically the same amount of money on
the sandpaper as you would for one of
these assuming they sell them again and
also the hour of time has value too so
either way neither of these things our
sanded version or the rocket coal IHS
neither of them are necessary you don't
even need to deal it it's just it's not
needed if you want to do it for fun or I
mean delighting does drop temperature
like 14 degrees in solve our test cases
which is significant that allows you to
run a lot quieter fan speeds if you want
a deal it'd really you can just deal it
and put liquid metal on it and call it a
day if you really want to go the full
copper like no no nickel plating IHS
approach yeah you could sand down yours
it's really just because it's cool and
kind of fun at that point
and if you don't find it fun then don't
bother caning a lot from it the rocky
cool one same thing an extra couple
degrees isn't gonna change anything
especially on an APU it's just something
that's kind of fun to do if you want to
mess around with it because it's cheap
and it's not a big commitment if you've
already done the deal itting but again
neither of these things are things that
you should get worked up over or
deliberate over for more than a few
minutes because it's not gonna change
your end result for overclocking and
stuff like that but dewetting
will that's mostly because you're
getting rid of silicon adhesive and
thermal paste and replace it with liquid
metal it's just the IHS part doesn't
matter a whole lot
anyway it was a fun project the IHS is
really shiny now so that's kind of cool
I guess makes for a good thumbnail or
something maybe some good b-roll but
that's mostly the end result what might
be fun is maybe laughing the inside of
it
but we're still gonna be looking at less
than one degree difference so maybe both
sides of it will get us to which just is
barely even worth it so that's it for
