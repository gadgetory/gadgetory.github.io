at CES 2019 this isn't it's not PC
enthusiast starter but we've covered
some of the classic consoles lately you
might have seen our ps1 classic look
might have seen our Superboy look this
one it's by a different company it's the
Genesis portable system it's new here at
the show some of stuff is still TBD so
let's just get that out of the way first
the chassis externally probably going to
change some of the buttons might change
a bit but just for an early look this
might interest some of you for going
back to the Genesis in a sort of
handheld form factor because it can also
output via HDMI if you want to output to
a more modern larger display before that
this video is brought to you by the deep
cool captain 240 pro AO cooler the
captain 240 Pro uses a bladder within
the water tank to expand and contract
based on liquid temperature as a leak
prevention mechanism this works by
birthing air at higher temperatures
making for a unique closed-loop liquid
cooler design the captain 240 pro also
expands upon the existing captain series
by extending tube length for more
flexible positioning and updating the
LEDs learn more at the link in the
description below so go over the buttons
first I guess d-pad on the left side
you've got all the core buttons on the
right side two speakers oriented in the
bottom two bottom left bottom right HDMI
output on the top PL and NTSC switch so
something we saw also on the Superboy
we've seen it on while the ps1 classic
sort of resolved it internally but back
when PL and ntsc were more of a problem
these cartridges obviously will need to
be adapted to that based on the region
you're in so PL NTSC switch it is a cart
reader so this is not a software thing
there's no internal game storage it
doesn't store a bunch of the games it's
not emulation and it's again just like
the Superboy if you saw our coverage of
that you insert the cartridge the
cartridge it'll play off the cartridge
and that takes care of it don't know
what the CPU is going to be at this time
but probably no software involved so
insert the cartridge it should just work
to use Jenson's quote and then on or off
switch on the top left of course dcn a
couple things on the bottom that are
slightly obscured by the just a display
3m tape so ignore the tape there that's
for the show only obviously but that's
looking at probably about $70 release
maybe in June and then the size the the
form factor of the console might change
a little bit but Genesis portable is the
name that they're working with right now
the next one immediately across from
that is the n64 tribute controller so
these are in a wireless USB and the
original form-factor connector that you
can plug into the n64 if you use the
original has a built in for the original
console has a built-in rumble Pak I
guess or motor so you don't have to use
the original rumble Pak but you can and
then the USB options have a built-in
memory card reader but if not USB and
Wireless are available as options $30
for this one right here and then 25 next
to it you might notice it's a bit
different from the original true n64
controller whether or not that bothers
use that's entirely up to you some
people probably liked that and if they
did then I am sorry for whatever
happened to you to make you like the
original controller but then 64 tribute
is just kind of interesting couple more
we'll look at on the other wall and then
I think there's a cartridge we can talk
about too so this section will keep it a
bit shorter but these are officially
licensed by Sega products by retro bit
at their booth so nothing nothing fishy
going on but if you wanted a an
officially licensed Genesis there's a
Dreamcast there's a Saturn controller so
lots too many controllers for me to
memorize frankly will show some b-roll
so you can see what they are but plenty
of products I guess the idea here is
same thing as the n64 tribute you can
plug into USB right here there are some
wireless options there's some original
connector options and I guess it just
comes down to if you're playing
something for example an existing
emulator on your PC which is not
provided by retro bit but I'm positive
you could find online somewhere probably
then you can plug this in via USB it
might give you a bit more authentic
experience so kind of cool we wanted to
point it out for something a bit
different for the show either there's a
cartridge too so retro bit has a couple
of these this one it's an eye rim
licensed game so there's they still
exist and retro bit went got the license
for it they've got a $60 cartridge for
Metal Storm and that's we've got some
shots of it as well but these have been
launched before by retro bit it's just
the newest one and I guess if you're
looking for that kind of thing rather
than buying it through eBay and getting
the original for potentially hundreds of
dollars you've got an option in a
legitimate new cartridge so wanted to
point these out again it's not PC
enthusiasts Hardware coverage but cool
laughs and it's a bit of a fun break
from the six videos a day of CPUs GPUs
and motherboards so thank you for
watching as always subscribe for more go
to patreon.com/scishow sexist helps out
directly and I suppose check out retro
bit as well if any of this stuff
interest is interests you and we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
