beat X 2019 this booth pretty simple
we're just gonna talk about two cases
but the main one is a case of the mesh
front so the Phoenix has gotten the memo
on the end so they actually have an ENSO
mesh as well let's go out after the
original and so and the memo said more
mesh which this is the Nova mash TGS
literally hey this time we still need to
test it obviously but it is certainly an
uptick in design from the original
answer which is good before that this
video is brought to you by thermal takes
e360 DDC hard tubing water cooling kit
if you're ready to dip your toes into
the water and build your first open-loop
cooling system the Thermaltake c 360 DD
c hard tubing kit comes with all the
components you need the kit includes a
three sixty millimeter radiator three
120 a RGB fans a copper w-4 a RGB water
block for the CPU a pump and res DDC
combo and all the fittings needed to
build a full CPU open-loop learn more at
the link in the description below the
nova mesh TG will come with one 120
millimeter rear fan in the back that
will be a LED
stock and then the front will be one 120
in the front LED stock you have options
for 360 in the front 240 support in the
top four radiators that is and although
it is a bit crammed but it's offset
forward so depending on the heatsink
height on your vrm heatsink you may run
into a challenge there but if it's not
too tall in the vrm heatsink then maybe
a 240 top and then 120 fan in the back
which comes with it the LED strip in
this case is not included that's just
for the show floor build it actually
think it's probably without it anyway
and then tempered glass side panel here
this is like kinda semi prototype right
now so things are you know like most
things on the show it's it's not final
but pretty close there's a steel version
as well it's cheaper so this is $70 a
glass version $60 for the steel version
it does have a really fine mesh on the
front we're seeing a lot more of this
this year so like the cooler master and
our 600 for example has a similar one
the P 400 a from fan tax is a similar
one so that's getting popular one of the
biggest advantages of a fine mesh is
that you actually don't need a dust
filter behind it because you can just
wipe the mesh off and that is the dust
filter they did it do it
filter on this one it's pretty fine
material though so we're not sure how
much that will impact flow but this
would be just fine without a filter
honestly there's magnetic fields around
the bottom and I think that probably
wraps the mesh tgd it's really pretty
straightforward there's one more case
we'll move over to this one's pretty
simple as well so this is a saber and
the saber is primarily looks focused so
we're we're BitFenix got the memo on
mesh for the other case they did not on
this one it's got these like semi
removable things on the sides as a
prototype so like there's connection
problems right now but the front here
has a pin to pad contact which is
becoming more popular so that's good
pin the patch for the front panel no
cable required so you can remove the
panel off that's good
it's a brushed aluminum finish on the
front but unfortunately no air flow
really like at all
so that's restricting that's restricting
that doesn't do anything there's a
button like cover up feel that supposed
to be kind of like a throwback to the
c70 I think it was for the the course
the old coarser case where I had like a
nuclear switch button underneath for the
power so they're gonna do one of those
but this case is not exciting to me the
other one looks a bit more promising so
we'll be keeping an eye out for the Nova
mash TG to see if BitFenix has rectified
the issues with the N so that'll cover
it for this booth at Computex 2019 that
you were watching subscribe for more go

that directly or stored on cameras exits
not net I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
