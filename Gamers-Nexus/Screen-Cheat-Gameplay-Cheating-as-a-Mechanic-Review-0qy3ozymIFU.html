Nexus dotnet and today we were talking
about screen cheat which is a pretty fun
indie FPS title that is built around the
concept of screen looking or screen
cheating and actually encouraging the
use of that strategy we'll call it so if
you ever played local competitive games
and your friends on consoles back in the
day when split screen was a more common
thing what would happen at least with my
groups is we would kind of inadvertently
at first look at the screens on the
split screen layout of our opponents
figure out where they are and use that
information to navigate the map find
them and kill them
and this made camping effectively a
non-issue because it just wasn't
possible and this eventually devolved
into new tactics like looking at the
floor while running around and using
your memory to navigate the map and that
sort of eliminated the possibility of
your neighbor looking at your screen to
figure out where you were cuz you're
looking at the floor and you presumably
have some idea of where you are so this
comes into play in the game screen cheat
screen cheat has all players invisible
we are not drawn as character models in
the game
you do have an FPS view of your gun but
that gun is not shown to your opponents
so if you if you are looking at me in
the game in the FPS arena you see
nothing you see right through me
unless I'm doing certain things with
weapons certain weapons give off flames
and things like that so the only way to
figure out where your enemies are is to
look at their screen
everyone's screen is shown at the same
time and you can even over the internet
if you're playing over the Internet so
you you effectively see split screen
whether you're alone or not in real life
and you've got all four players shown at
once you look at their screens to figure
out where they are based upon the color
of the environment so every environment
is a different color it's it's pretty
it's not the best looking in terms of
aesthetics but it's very good
functionally because you can see okay
Steve is in the orange room I'm in the
Blue Room I go over to orange and I'm
gonna kill them and basically there are
different colors and objects to help
determine where a player is with
specificity and then
you shoot at where you think they are
and if you hit they're dead it's
Institute one hit one killer instant
give whatever I always forget how to say
that ut word but that is the idea so
it's it's pretty unique it's pretty
novel and that is ultimately what it is
is a novelty the game is very fun for a
couple of hours maybe 1 to 4 hours
depending on on how long you can be
entertained and it's really only fun if
you've got friends if you've got a
couple friends you can play this with
it's worth about 10 bucks each to get
into it I wouldn't spend more than that
but the mechanics are pretty good there
are a couple of fun weapons weapons
aren't perfectly balanced but you know
it's an indie title and it's kind of a
silly idea to begin with so really how
much can you ask for
but the maps are a bit fun the game
modes are actually pretty pretty cool so
there's of course deathmatch and stuff
like that king of the hill but there's
also a game mode that is time-based
with a single shot so you've got a
pistol with one bullet in it and every X
seconds I forget how long I think it's
15 seconds or so your ammo will reload
so you you need to use your bullet and
that time to try and kill someone and
then you can't reload until the time
expires so this is pretty interesting
because it becomes a game of chicken who
shoots first and if the person who
shoots first misses they're in big
trouble unless they can survive for that
reload time and get to their at their
next bullet there's another game called
murder mystery alright that's basically
what it is and every player is assigned
two cards now keep in mind that you can
see all four player screens at the same
time so this means that your cards when
you look at them everyone else can see
them to imagine playing cards at a table
every time you look at your own cards it
flips it face up on the table it's that
idea so basically you keep them
concealed until you're ready to take a
peek when you think everyone's
preoccupied pop them up for a second
dropping back down and what they show is
who your target is you have to kill that
person it doesn't tell you what their
name is it just tells you what part of
the map they are currently located in
and then the second card says what
weapon you need to kill them with thus
murder mystery so the fun of it
is when multiple players are in the blue
room for instance and you have to kill a
player in the blue room you've got uh
sort of let things transpire for a few
moments while you deduce which of those
two players is your real target and
that's a very unique and fun game-mode I
don't think it's got a lot of staying
power he probably are pretty limited and
how many sessions you will invest into
that mode but it is fun overall screen
sheet is a pretty good game it plays
very well for what it is it's
interesting for a couple of hours at
best I would price it at about ten
dollars I probably wouldn't personally
want to play more to pay more than that
excuse me but it's not bad it's a good
novelty at the end of the day that's
what it is it's a novelty it doesn't
have a ton of staying power and
replayability but pretty fun for the
time being so that is all for this
review I will see you all next time
