after we reviewed the 2600 K and Phenom
2x6 CPUs and focuses on an even older
architecture yet Intel's Nehalem line
initially shown at IDF 2007 and launched
in November of 2008 this was originally
bought before we did Hardware reviews
even and lived in a personal system for
several years by seven nine thirty model
that we have released in first quarter
of 2010 for 294 dollars which was one
year prior to the launch of the Intel
Sandy Bridge architecture today we're
revisiting the i7 930 versus modern CPUs
at Phenom 2's FX and Sandy Bridge parts
the last of which is arguably one of
Intel's best architectures that they've
ever shipped to consumer market and just
barely followed in a halo before getting
to those that this coverage is brought
to you by EVGA and their 1080p is c2
which we've recommended fairly highly
for its build quality and the icx
sensors which are kind of fun to play
with you can check our full sc2 review
for the 1080i if you're curious to learn
more or you can click the link in the
description below to find the product
page for the 1080i sc2 Nehalem was a big
deal for Intel it was the appearance of
the i5 and i7 lines and one we have
particularly is the i7 930 is ad
stepping chip so it came a bit later and
have some more overclocking Headroom
than the preceding chips in that line
but just after the i7 930 shift about
one year is when Sandy Bridge showed up
and Sandy Bridge performed so well that
if you were an i7 930 buyer you might
have felt some buyer's remorse
just a short while later this was back
when the gains receive you architectures
were much greater than they are today
perhaps the one difference being rise in
versus effect because AMD had what five
years in between those of course they
saw much greater gains than Intel does
today so this was a different time in
terms of CPU growth in performance and
made the releases a lot more exciting
and that's why we're revisiting the 930
it's probably not as widespread as Sandy
Bridge but was still one of the more
popular chips perhaps just after the q6
hundred that was a common upgrade path q
sixty-six hundred thousand nine thirty
and is actually the one that I took way
back then
aside from introducing the core i5 and
i7 series branding the Nehalem chip that
we're looking at also along with its
counterparts in this architecture
introduced the four core eight thread
approach with hyper threading for the
consumer market this was not the first
time that hyper threading appeared but
was its reintroduction after what was a
pretty rocky launch period for the
Pentium 4 as a type of threading back
when those launch Pentium 4s had a whole
lot of issues so this was another
attempt at it and it worked out a lot
better the i3 s came a bit later than
the hey ylim but the I sevens were on an
X with the a platform so they were some
of the earlier x-series chips before we
started doing weird things with X 299
like we are today from a historical
perspective the gaming TV is on most our
charts today we'll be competing with the
$294 I 7 930 including the two $95
phenom 2 X 6 1090 T and the $200 1055 T
which launched later that year just
following the i7 930
the $216 at launch i-5 2500 K is also
present as is the $317 at launch i7 2670
later and that provides some context for
how the 930 was holding up in 2010 but
when comparing these cpus it's important
to keep in mind that the Nehalem
architecture had already existed for
quite some time now for a modern
perspective from a quick search on ebay
there are multiple listings for i7 930 s
at or under $40 compared to the overly
optimistic prices of 140 ish dollars for
2600 k's well we did purchase ours
recently for about 80 luckily there are
even $65 10:55 T's that gives us
perspective our revisits are typically
approached from a should I keep it
perspective rather than should I buy it
but the i7 930 is selling cheap enough
less than a G 45 60 even that is worth
putting an interesting spin on these
results of course the i/o and the
platform are aging so that is a concern
but ultimately this is an architecture
that was introduced in 2007 launched in
2008 and had its final show in 2010
the eyes of a 9:30 our first test was a
rough start to the 9:30 at stock
settings the multi-threaded score for
Cinebench was 474 dot seven points just
below everything for the most part this
includes the 1090 T that it competed
with in 2010 it does however beat out
the AI 373 50k but that hardly counts as
the 70 250 K it should always be
overclocked and never used for
production
anyway the not overclockable and more
expensive G 45 60 and i3 6300 buy more
expensively means that a modern Nehalem
chip do lose out but again they are not
designed for rendering
however the 4 gigahertz overclock
increased the score by 34% to 630 6.3
that new score isn't the highest on the
chart but it is higher than its
successor the stock i7 2670 performance
continues to be among the lowest on the
chart despite increased frequency but
this matters more in gaming than here
let's move next to blender blenders
render time was reduced about the same
24.7% putting it right between the i-5
2600 case stock and OC scores other i5
si threes and the six core Phenom 2's do
worse as does the stock 2600 K or modern
CPUs with greater than four threads all
easily outstripped the AG and i7 930
starting off with our game benchmarks
with an older title more representative
of the era Metro last light at 1080p
post the Intel i7 930 stock CPU at 90
FPS average lows are at 63 1% and 59
0.1%
sustained reasonably well thanks to the
8 threads on the CPU the 2010 i7 930
spicy views positioned just behind the
2014 FX 83-70 stock CPU for a comparison
that everyone can relate to the i7 2600
at an average of 111 FPS posting a 22%
lead over the 930 the 4.7 gigahertz
overclocked 2600 K counterpart places at
130 FPS average or adjacent to an i7
4790k and r7 1700 OC this shows why
Sandy Bridge was so good
overclocking the i7 930 Nehalem CPU the
4 gigahertz gets it up to 113 FPS
average with high frame time consistency
in the lows and thanks to the EOC we're
now outperforming the
Hunter K and the r5 1500 Xbox CPUs ashes
of the singularity might be somewhat of
a different story as DirectX 12 doesn't
necessarily play it nice with these
older CPUs for the non escalation
version of the game the i7 930 stock
Seaview performs an average FPS of 20
with its overclocked variant at 27 this
ties the stock i7 930 with the FX 80 to
70 once again and roughly with the i5
2500 k the i7 2670 6.5 FPS average
providing it a 34% lead over the iso 930
stock CPU overclock in the 2200 K gets
it to 33 FPS average which posts a
lesson that lead over the overclocked
930 of 23% the closest Rison ship is the
r5 1500 x which manages to maintain a
34% lead over the tired eyes of a 930 so
that lead is largely taken away when
both are overclocked
if you care for Ash's escalation that
there in the article below well ops
talks to is one of the more heavily
multi-threaded titles and will provide
the next best look at how Intel's first
consumer 8 thread CPU has aged the Intel
i7 930 in the Halo mtvU operates just
below 60 FPS average with lows at 44 and
36 this places it nearly exactly times
in frame time and frame rate with the
i-5 2500 K and allows the i7 930 to
maintain a lead over the Phenom 2 X 6
pen 9 TT 4 gigahertz CPU by 27% that
said Nehalem looks a bit rough when
compared to the 2600 K released just one
year later which operates a 74 FPS
average for about a 25% speed increase
overclocking the i7 932 4 gigahertz gets
it up to the r5 1500 x OC levels of
performance both at 4 gigahertz which
really isn't so bad for a CPU made seven
years ago for perspective on Intel's
annual scaling the 77 hard K operates 92
percent faster than with stock i7 930
the 6700 K operates 88 percent faster
the 4790k operates 70% faster and we
skipped the 3000 3s and see the 2600 K
operates 25% faster and that's stock for
all those numbers moving to total war
Warhammer as a serious CPU stressor the
i7 930 operates a 9
SPS average with high settings placing
it about 32% ahead of the 1090 T stock
CPU with the 2500 K roughly tied to the
930 the FX 83-70 actually manages to
outperform the stock i7 930 in this
particular test operating a 104 FPS
average for a 16 point 5 percent lead
over the 930 the G 4560 notably also
manages to outperform the i7 9:30
both of these hold the lead because
though war or hammer is more clock
dependent than core dependent as
illustrated by the i7 930 s overclocked
results when overclocked the 930 now
runs a 119 FPS average permitting it to
surpass the 2600 K stock CPU just to put
these numbers into perspective the
modern i7 70 to 100 K holds about a 60%
lead over the overclocked at 9:30 though
we are close to bumping into the GPU
limit at that point anyway for
Battlefield 1 the i7 930 runs an average
FPS of 96 this place is it just ahead of
the x6 1090 T 4 gigahertz OC CPU and
just behind the FX 83-70 stock CPU the
closest rise in CPU is the r5 1500 X at
126 fps for a lead of 32% over the stock
930 the 2600 K for reference is about
tied with the overclocked 930 and about
22% ahead of the stock 930 this seems
fairly consistent with other tests where
the 2600 K generally maintains a lead of
at least 20% stock to stock testing
without the context of Sandy Bridge and
its timing contact Nehalem would look a
lot better it still looks pretty good
though the CPU has held on reasonably in
most tests when overclocked at ties with
the i7 2622 25 percent gain in gaming
and about a 30 to 35 inch percent gain
and synthetics and you can find more of
those in the article below
so overall 40 gigahertz on it not bad
that's about what people were pushing on
air for the most part back then and that
is coming up from a 2.8 gigahertz clock
stock out of the box this was a later
stepping CPU so it did happen to do a
bit better than some of the earlier
iterations in the production run but
overall looking at it today if you own a
Nehalem chip and you're not just
watching this because it's cool to see
how all the hardware performs
if you own one
the question to ask yourself is are you
happy with its performance that's always
the question
there's a lot of time we get questions
of should I upgrade it's hard to answer
that there's always a reason you can
find to upgrade but should you it
depends on how you feel about the
computer today is it doing what you want
the answer is yes then keep using it
it's fine if the answer is no it's
holding you back in production tasks or
in gaming you're not getting that PS you
want then we've got all the numbers for
you in this video so you can make the
comparison to the 930 versus the newer
stuff rise in this out so Rison
certainly changes things up from the FX
series if you've been out of the game
for a while the r5 CPUs are a very good
value versus something like an i5 and
we'll give you more production mobility
and then the i7 77 hard case still does
quite well for a pure gaming build it's
very gaming and purist you're targeting
something like 120 144 FPS then the i7
7700 K is worth looking at X 299 is also
out we have plenty of covers on that and
thread rippers next so that should more
or less catch anyone who's been out of
the game for a while up to the current
market and then give you some keywords
to look for on the channel we've covered
all that stuff but at this point other
than thread Ripper which is TBD so as
always thank you for watching you can go
to patreon.com/scishow and ice list
elves out directly or you can go to
store that gamers nexus dot net to pick
up a shirt like this one we have tribal
ends as well and as always subscribe for
more thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time
