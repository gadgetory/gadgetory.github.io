Dwarfs game forced which was a
cooperative arcade brawler that reminded
us of the gauntlet series of anyone
remembers that and showdown takes a
different turn resurrecting its battle
proven arena combat from forced strictly
in a single player format but it also
adds a splash of strategy through a
cards system and companion system and
this is building upon forced a game that
we really did like quite a bit for a
single player but especially for its
cooperative gameplay elements and
showdown takes that formula and reduces
it distills it's down to a single player
game so if you don't want to sit around
and try and collect the friends to brawl
through the same type of mechanics if
you like those arena-style arena dungeon
crawler style gameplay mechanics then
showdown is worth a look before getting
into more of this a few things we're
giving away 20 keys for the game forced
showdown and with thanks to system

forced giveaway tweet and that is again
linked below or comment on this video
subscribe on YouTube to get a key if you
are one of the 20 that are selected or
just watch the video and redeem let's
talk about showdown so for showdown
drops us into an artfully stylized arena
with a voiceover work that builds on a
boxing ring atmosphere sort of like the
quake and UT voiceovers that you hear
and they're very bombastic and overly
done but playful and
works well with the environment players
take control over one of four characters
storm brainer is returning from force
that be the archer squire of light
ravager and volcko are sort of new but
plays on some of the same ideas from
forest and each character has two core
abilities a base attack and access to a
complex card system for further
empowerment cards are drawn so to speak
at the beginning of each arena match
they're dealt to you and you've got
limited mana which is basically currency
so you use that mana to fund your card
selection and if you don't like the card
you can use the Mulligan system which
works as any Mulligan system does you
sacrifice some things and return for a
new card draw card selection uses stats
and ability modifiers with specific
conditions to offer a strategic element
to a game that's otherwise just an
arcade brawler so it's not a card game
it doesn't go that heavy into the cards
direction but it's got cards available
basically as stats modifiers so that you
can use those to sort of spiced up
gameplay and trigger some unique and
interesting combos with the abilities
and what's describable only as acute
dragon and so-called wizard puffs
companions will also join us on the
battlefield to provide cover fire but
that's really about it early on they die
pretty quickly and respawn the next
round but they have unique clever means
of deployment that can turn the tide of
battle and they do get larger and more
powerful as you progress through the
game so they become pretty intimidating
to your enemies as you do move forward
even though they're really just sort of
cute and I quickly early on much like
Balthus from the original forest game
these companions can be used just to
sort of draw enemies in a way that
creates some unique gameplay mechanics
and opportunities showdown is a much
different game from the original forced
the mechanics are more or less the same
at a fundamental level but the spirit
ball mechanic with Balthus is gone and
the cooperative gameplay has been axed
to just single player gameplay so we
talked to beta dwarf about this
previously at one of the packs events
and they explained to us that this was a
move to build upon the brand that he
created with forest and expand the
studio which experienced really pretty
explosive growth from
the first game launched they were very
successful with forced so this is a play
at taking sort of the same IP but
building it in a different way so that
the studio doesn't get sucked into
creating the same game over and over
like we see with many of the triple-a
studios today that is something to
trying desperately to avoid and have
done well with showdown gameplay
progression is a simple multistage set
up with the character advancements sort
of coming to you as you work through
each of the arena rounds and card
unlocks also appear as you fight through
the battles and work your way towards
boss stages like a ccg mulligans as
stated before again we performed to
refresh the card pool for impending
rounds movement is handled with WASD
attacks are handled with clicks and pot
Kesey and so forth and companions manage
themselves pretty much entirely but you
can do some unique navigation around the
course to force path finding that will
cause them to react in ways that are
beneficial to combat over all the games
mood is playful but never in an
obnoxious or overly silly way just like
forest again and it's good for a spot of
Arkady action in a pretty and fast place
gameplay environment and atmosphere
players who are seeking something
comparable to a single-player arcade
arena crawler experience should
seriously consider forced showdown
especially if you like the first forced
but maybe want to play a single player
version of it sort of stay tuned for
full critique and review of this game it
is approaching for a March 29th launch
date and you can also win some of the
keys in this sort of contest giveaway
thing we're doing and hopefully you've
gotten a chance to redeem one of those
through the video if not count below
subscribe or retweet the tweet and
follow us on Twitter and we'll look
through those submissions and see if we
can give away some more keys so as
always subscribe thanks for watching
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
