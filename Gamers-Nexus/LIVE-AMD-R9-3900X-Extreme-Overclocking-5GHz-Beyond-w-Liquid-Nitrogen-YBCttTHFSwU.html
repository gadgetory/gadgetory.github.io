to use here we should be live so let me
give it a minute for the video to pop up
and today we're gonna be doing Alan to
overclocking with risin the 3900 ax
hopefully let me know in chat if you can
hear everything okay and if the videos
playing back properly
but yes today is an X OC stream for the
3900 X should be able to hit 5 gigahertz
without any issue really I think and
we're probably gonna leave memory alone
for the most part and just focus on CPU
there's some stuff I want to show so I'm
really interesting non ex OC stuff we're
gonna use Allen 2 as a tool to do some
other thermal demonstrations and those
will be in a separate video we have
going up to but we can go through some
of them today it's really interesting
how it works we are 5 by 5 very cool so
looks like everyone says it's all good
to go
and also someone says no mr. beard no
Joe's not here for this one though he's
been doing his own streams on bearded
hardware lately for Rison as well so I
think he's doing every Thursday or
something 30 to 60 min delay on super
chats is that video delay or just
because you'll be busy I'll be very busy
with managing the overclock this is
standard for us we I'll do all the Super
chats all of them through the stream up
until towards the very end I'll say okay
no more Super chats we got to close this
out but we'll do all of them it's just
you have to give us 30 to 60 minutes
because there's so much going on that I
can't I can't just look only at them
otherwise there's no actual stream
motherboard is going to be the x5 70
master and I think I think that should
is that a new PS view for the bench it's
actually one of our oldest power
supplies that's good it's a it's like a
1200 watt I think 1200 watt NZXT Hale 9
DB 2 or something ok so it looks like
chats loading up people are joining in
and I've tweeted out the link I guess I
think we're good to kind of just start
talking through all this so one thing I
want to do is demonstrate the thermal
scaling versus frequency like I said
we're gonna have a separate video on
this but this is really important and
it's not even xoc stuff we're gonna use
Allen to to demonstrate it but I'm
actually gonna keep it above zero at
kind of like normal temperatures and
even hot temperatures and demonstrate
how the clock versus temperature scales
rise in 3000 is a lot more like modern
GPUs than it is like CPUs in the past to
the extent that if you don't control
your temperature and testing as a
reviewer like your ambient temperature
it can affect the scores in a pretty
significant way so this is something
we've been researching the last couple
of days Patrick's been working on it we
have a whole whole special video going
up on that that's getting finalized
tonight and then we'll have another one
after that
but yeah that'll be that'll be pretty
pretty interesting stuff that we can
show as a preview today I'm just gonna
kind of wait for chat to load in a
little bit more let me get the first
couple Super chats before we get going
WC current $2 so what cpu is this it is
not the 79 80 XE a CPU that will
remember you remembered for Hall time
it is a 3900 X though and I've got
Romans beast Allen teapot on it except
if we kind of part the Joe's not here so
I actually insulated it a lot Joe is a
got a lot more experience than I do so
he isn't as paranoid about getting parts
wet but you can see here I've elegantly
zip-tied one half of the ellentube pot
down to the board is the best I could do
but it's stable it's like fixed now and
this side it's just like a an m4 through
rod that I found and and then a couple
just a nut on the top of it to fasten it
to the Allen teapot so that's just
because we didn't have the exact correct
mounting plate for a m4 so zip ties
hopefully will hold it for now we might
have some paste issues as we get going
but we'll see and
yeah that's their Bowers biggest pot we
can get a top-down shot of it later once
it's got smellin too and it's pretty
cool it's got a lot of surface area
Chris tech tips $5 whoo the first Super
chat I'm so I'm so sorry your second by
a couple seconds watchin from the UK
well thank you Chris tech tips for
watching I'm sure you'll give Linus run
for his money
Zachary Blair $1 thank you and $1 again
thank you
Phoenix 1861 a $4.99 thank you and
builds wide for all the Expo 570 content
I'm running at 6600 koz 170 Triple A
gaming should I upgrade to Matisse or
wait for rise in 4000 series I don't
know how long that way it's going to be
we don't even really have any it for me
well we do we do have a bit of
information they had a road map for is
m3 I don't remember when it was supposed
to be but it's public though you could
find out if you're on a 6600 K that's
pretty good CPU already and if you
overclock it you'll be good for a while
but it is an i5 so if you feel like in
some of your games there's some
variability in the frame times like if
you see it's not a rating more often
than you'd like and you can diagnose it
down to the CPU 3000 series is a good
family of processors thus far so I
certainly wouldn't feel bad about that
upgrade I'm gonna read a two more and
then get going
melis Barbossa $20 thank you very much
Jesus hair on steroids
Benedict gee $5 still no 3900 ox in
Germany probably for another week I
didn't know that but I've heard that
there's availability issues so oK we've
got two thousand people in chat and or
in Abby's dream anyway what is the Alan
teapot it is the Dare Bauer beast so
that is Romans he obviously has a
YouTube channel as well you probably
know who he is but he made that one he
sent it to me a while ago and we're
finally using it so I need to fill a
couple of these and then we can get
started this
I'll give the quick walkthrough of this
stuff again I guess I don't know how
many of you can sound off in chat how
many of you know there's bearded
hardware
can we stop chicken clock in
well Joe unfortunately that never stops
unless tin is around and then then all
of the fun stops and it's very serious
until he starts throwing Ellen to events
so sound off in chat though if you've
seen these streams before I want to I
want to get an idea you just give me yes
or no I want to get an idea for how much
I need to explain on the the basics here
which monitor is this
I should have linked that in the
description it's some a or some aureus
monitor gigabyte we ran it as an ad for
awhile
27 Q the ad 27 QD I think okay
looks like a good amount of people I've
seen these before all this a couple of
knows in there it's about 30% now so
I'll do some basic explanation but not
too much what we've got is liquid
nitrogen it's contained to my my left
right now in that big cylinder that
comes from a local supplier that's a 180
liter cylinder we've had most of it leak
out unfortunately when it was on the
truck come in here and that costs about
a hundred and a little under $180 for
one of those we've found that they
preserve for if they're good if it's a
good tank they preserve for maybe two
months or so it might be a little bit
more and and then you kind of have to
you'll have very little left at that
point this is a doer this is a thirty
liter Dewar I use this transfer hose to
move the liquid nitrogen from this tank
which is there I think they're vacuum
sealed I'm pretty sure is the correct
terminology it's like a tank within a
tank vacuum chamber I don't know but
tank within a tank so that should hold
longer than these you use transfer hose
these are about four hundred dollars
they're really expensive and that
transfers into one of these these are
also a couple hundred dollars if you buy
new it's like five six hundred so that
contains our Allen - it's got 30 liters
in it for today
that's got maybe I don't know 50 80 left
something like that no gloves yeah we
should talk about that too
there's a couple things on because I
know these questions are gonna come up
throughout the stream safety with Allen
T the only real thing you need to worry
about is displacing I guess the oxygen
in the local atmosphere with the Ellen
to exhaust and nitrogen so the way as
this is Joe's demonstration bearded
hardware I think he's in chat or he was
anyway you can find just do a youtube
search for bearded hardware if you want
to watch him later but Joe is
demonstration that he showed me was can
you light a torch yep there now and if
you can light a torch there's enough
oxygen in there what builds weight told
me is if you start to feel dizzy leave
the room because you kind of go from
dizzy to dead if you replace all the
oxygen but it is not a concern for us
we're in a very big open space here and
not only is it a big open space but
we've got AC running constantly so
ventilation is no issue for us but
that's something that's important to
know if you did want to do this other
points so people asking our gloves the
problem I have with gloves first of all
if you do want to use gloves you use
special gloves that are rated for this
stuff because if you just use like any
workman's gloves or something they won't
resist the cold that can stick to your
hands and so the concern with Alan to is
soaking it's not contact so soaking
would be like you pour it into your shoe
and then you just stand there and a in a
puddle of volunteer Ellen to mostly will
evaporate immediately as you can see
there so do I need to do that again your
camera no so it mostly evaporates
straight away if there's enough of it
where it's like all kind of pooling
together it'll like I mean like in here
then it won't evaporate right away and
you can have it soak into your sock or
something and that'll hurt but if it's
just contact there's no real I mean
doesn't doesn't hurt so so that's the
safety walkthrough as for why don't I
use gloves they get in the way so they
get in the way
to the extent that it's more dangerous
to use the gloves than not because if
you're trying I mean think about like
trying to handle these thermoses with
the gloves it's not particularly
dexterous to do so you're gonna be
inaccurate and pouring and that's like
this and you share more likely to spill
on yourself with the gloves than without
and if you spill on yourself just like
glazing I guess it won't hurt so that's
the explanation hopefully we can we can
leave it there for the most part let's
turn this thing on no Alan's you in
there right now Leidenfrost effect yes
that is if you want to look up why why
that happens that's what you look up
Leidenfrost effect mist so anyway that's
there's your walk through okay so I'm
booting this thing I think we're going
straight into Windows right now yes all
right cool and here it is hardware doing
a super chat for two dollars let's go do
we need to let's do a base run so
bearded hardware says don't hurt
yourself slacker all right what we're
gonna do is actually a demonstration
first so I am I'm not gonna start with
the the overclock and I want to start
with stock performance actually need to
make sure BIOS is set up correctly for
this so risin 3000 like I was saying
before most of you joined in has some
very interesting behaviors and that it's
really thermal dependent this time the
the cooler you use will greatly impact
the performance of the chip this is
something coming up in a video that's
being finalized today so cooler
performance matters a lot if you use the
stock cooler even if it can support it
you can almost certainly get more
performance out of a better cooler and
this is kind of like I said more related
to the way GPUs perform these days where
you get clock boosting based contingent
upon things like thermal
and we're just gonna do XMP for this at
least for now actually this is a
different kit of memory I haven't tested
this one so it's all fine fine for now
so the boosting contingent Devon
thermals is something that we can
demonstrate as stock performance where
we're gonna go into the PBO menu and
explicitly disable it okay it's off
because the CPU is performing is
behaving as stock right now the only
thing we've changed is the memory and
I'm not sure if that if those settings
are gonna be stable I haven't tested
this kid on here but I think that should
be all we need for this demo so we've
changed nothing basically except for
making sure PBO is explicitly disabled
let me get a couple super chats while
this is booting so we had one from Jacob
Morris $1.00 no message thank you the
garland family two dollars you deserve
this money thanks for your help and
advice glad that it helps you and
hopefully your you've got some kind of
PC build project that we've assisted
with recently little shmoop with $5 if I
can sell my 2700 acts for 250 is the
upgraded single threaded performance
worth the $80 I'm assuming to have 3,700
X 80 box is pretty good so I'm I'm gonna
go with yes green James $2.00 how do you
overclock your hair with we've done
those ads with the EVGA CLC 280 I think
what temperature are we add on here how
we're pretty good right now okay pot
temperature 29
I think memory might not be stable the
way I said it so we'll just be back in
oh I did I pulled the Joe unplug the SSD
so that we can boot into BIOS faster
which also means that it won't boot into
Windows because there's no SSD all right
Addison will excite dollars would you
ever consider building a phase change
cooler would make a cool video series
consider yes know how to no got bearded
hardware is Joshua Bell five dollars do
you think Gen 4 will attack high-end IGP
workloads I don't know
don't think so okay cool it's booting me
and Eric the Red
$1 thank you Oh
bearded hardware again Ellen to slacker
do I have to buy a 3900 x2 hashtag ripp
GN I mean if you want to go you just
come up here and we'll do it through a
stream that would be kind of cool do
like set Jo up on that table or
something and do like verses that might
be kind of interesting jo will have to
sandbag it okay I'm just gonna use our
15 here because it's fast and we might
use our 20 later so what we're gonna do
is the frequency demonstration I was
talking about there's one question I
explicitly wanted to answer and we'll
get all of them but where is it
Allie Robertson $2.00 299 is the 3800 X
embargoed isn't it best for single core
it is not embargoed but it's not out we
can't get it can't even buy it
okay so here's the demo where's our
temperature temperature on the CPU is
currently 46 to 55 apparently we don't
have any Allen to in there right now and
what I'm going to do I want everyone to
pay attention to the the scores and the
frequency we're at versus the
temperature let's pop that out
separately
there's our frequencies and and Rudy
need me to angle this more towards the
camera that's good okay I move this out
of the way
okay I'm gonna we we might hit a thermal
issue okay so we have no Allen to in
here right now let's get a baseline for
just our 15 temperature is currently
about 70 that's just the Allen teapot
soaking right now no no Ellen to as I
said very clear about that and I'm gonna
take notes on these results while we go
so at roughly 71 degrees Celsius all
stock PBO explicitly disabled as it's
not stock we got 31 74 points okay so
keep that number in mind let's run it a
few more times and heat up to around 80
let's see if we can run this at maybe 80
85 and we need to pay attention to
frequency to so we're roughly forty
seventy-five megahertz here and I'll
you'll see the point I'm getting to as
we go through it 40 50 to 40 100
depending on which threads getting it
and I need to take a note of that so we
were at roughly 40 50 to 40 100 let's
call it 40 75 and then this is just more
of a tech demo I guess to really show
behavior so what I want to do is
intentionally heat the CPU up and keep
this running as we go so we're gonna get
it we're at 75 ish let's keep running it
a few more times and we should
eventually hit the 80 number that I want
to demonstrate this on
guess we'll just keep this over here and
not click anything there we go we're
about 80 now so let me run one more time
now that we're 80 so now we're still on
40 50 range but we're closer to 40 50 at
this point then 40 75 and 40 100 so now
we're we're more or less locked at 40 50
on all the cores we're even dropping to
40 25 in some instances that was at 78
degrees so the point I'm making is that
and also our score is now 31 40 from 31
74 originally so the point being made is
that thermal will impact the frequency
and thus the scores and so now this is
without Alan - that is correct we are
going to we're going to demonstrate what
a boost do with Alan - next so now what
I'm going to do is do a controlled
decrease in temperature we're not going
to go full pot right away we're not
gonna go like minus 100 what I'm going
to do is is probably just bring it down
to maybe 50 or so and we're fine I was
gonna change the update frequency by
request but it's fine for what we're
doing so I'm going to just try and I'm
not gonna go too hard for this we only
want to come down to maybe 50 let's call
it 60 maybe because I did a 70 run and
an 80 run so we're currently we're a
little too hot still we're basically
where we were before let's bring it down
some more so this is a practical
demonstration I want everyone to be
clear on that
even though I'm using Alan - I'm using
it as a tool to control the temperature
for purposes of a practical frequency
versus thermal demonstration like you
would encounter with a sort of a stock
cooler versus maybe a good liquid cooler
so we're currently around 50 it's still
coming down but it's also not doing any
work look right now just give it a
second to soak I'll do Super chats and
stuff in a moment like I said if you if
you buy anything from the store during
the stream to like the new Jeon toolkit
you go to store like Aaron's taxes
dotnet and I'll try and shout out the
orders if you pick one up on the store
during the stream okay so we're at 3
when were idle let's see what that gives
us pay attention to frequency now you
can see a very big jump we're at 40 150
ish plus or minus 25 either side and
that's at about 60 degrees 63 6 so it's
call it's let's call it 59 to 63 because
it does change throughout the test and
that gave us about 40 150 so you can
start to see how this is I'm not doing
anything all I'm doing is making it
colder and it's not even that cold it's
it's a temperature you could reasonably
achieve with like a 280 mm meter liquid
cooler so that increased our score from
31 74 to 30 205 and so the point I'm
beginning to make is that temperature
matters a lot especially if you're a
reviewer in our case controlling ambient
if you test one day at 80 degrees
Fahrenheit room temperature let's call
it like 21 C next they may be attached
to twenty five or six C that can impact
the results and make the data in
comparable because Rison is getting the
most out of its clock at this point it's
it's like GPU boosting behavior where
they're pushing it to try and get as
much as possible based upon the the
thermal the power of the current
situation so we are at roughly let's see
where we are loaded right 50 or so plus
or minus two no it's going higher than
that maybe fifty five forty two hundred
though at roughly another five to seven
degrees lower than we were last time so
that's we've gotten another maybe
twenty-five to fifty megahertz out of
the clock by doing literally nothing
except for colder so hopefully this is
interesting I will I'll read some of the
chat and see if anyone what people think
if like does this demonstration make
sense do you follow to be really clear a
lot of new people have joined in so to
be really clear what I've just done is
we're using Allen to but I'm not
sub-zero I'm above ambient temperature
and we're just demonstrated with PBO off
how precision boost to which is
different from PBO behaves natively just
by changing your cool
solution like air cooler versus whatever
so it looks like chat finds this pretty
interesting cool good to hear
what is PB o PB o is precision boost
overdrive which is quickly to what
motherboard gigabyte XY Sony master
precision boost overdrive is different
from precision boost precision abuse to
technically is what X so far has been
rolled into extended frequency range so
precision boost to allows the CPU to
boost two different clocks again
contingent upon the the thermal scenario
the current limits that are stock set by
AMD by the CPU or you can override with
motherboard limits but PBO is the where
you start overwriting stuff so precision
abused overdrive basically says in
theory ignore these limitations and just
boost as much as you can and well that
we have a really detailed video on that
coming out imminently so I'll leave that
explanation there you can you can check
out the video for a really full coverage
of it Patrick's been working on it for a
couple days now so okay that's the demo
I wanted to do well let's bring it down
some more though so our last score was
thirty to forty six doing literally
nothing and that was at about 55 degrees
Celsius let's get another number so
we'll do a scaling all the way down to
below zero where are we where we're
still too hot for this so we're at like
37 right now let me let that soak and
cool for a moment what CP it's a 3900 X
so what we're demonstrating is how
frequency scales versus temperature
without any manual overclocking Cooper
ten dollars thank you thank you for the
insightful content how would you split
that CPU scores for to gaming VMS ie
number of cores what setting one chip
late' per VM improve FPS 20 atti for 157
art for the other I think in theory it
would but I have not tried that so I'm
not not really sure but I believe in
theory that makes sense Adam Ballinger
$2.00 well power consumption on the XY
so many chips that get better from what
I understand
and he was telling us that the chipset
power was supposed to be one number like
11 to 14 watts is what they gave us
originally official number and then they
the board partners told us that the
chips had didn't do any down clock you
know it burned that amount of power
constantly but that later it should
change so I don't know if that's going
to turned out to be true or not but
that's what we were told our WD turbo $2
your mom you are mom what why oh you
apostrophe re mom bana are two dollars
you Lala RTX ponytail off okay all right
let's keep going with this demo so I
need to pull it down some more oh that's
actually plenty cool for this it's our
pot temperature is minus 2.8 but we are
still above zero because there's a big
Delta because I don't have a great
amount but so we're running out 36 now
for this and let's see what that scale
is we're 40 to 25 to 40 to 75 thirty to
fifty seven points
previously it was thirty to forty six
points and that was at about 36 c-32 did
I 75 57 is where I meant to say and that
was that let's run it more time I think
that was at 42 25 to 40 - yeah 40 to 50
right there 25
so basically 42:25 is what we're getting
and originally to recap when we were at
71 degrees Celsius for the CPU
temperature which is not unreasonable
for you to run your own CPU at that was
a 40 50 to 40 100 and now we're at 42 25
by getting down to 36 degrees you're
gonna be more reasonable 55 or at 4200
so pretty cool stuff let's bring it down
more again
no actual overclocking yet we'll save
that for later just a tech demo of how
precision boost functions because we
found this out kind of notice that
yesterday and thought it was very
interesting
so let's run it at roughly 24 26 degrees
Celsius work that's a bit warmer than
that we need to go a bit colder still
we're six degrees lower on average for
this runs on the previous that was still
a higher score but I didn't pay
attention to the frequency numbers so
let's let's get it to like maybe let's
try and round it up maybe 26 for this
one and keep going this is a
multi-threaded we could do single though
that's a good point
okay so we're running this one let's
call it 18 it's plus or minus 2 because
the start and end temperatures are
obviously different and we're at 40 to
50 to 4300 now it's 4300 quite a big
jump and that was like 18 degrees forty
to fifty to forty three hundred from
eight I think this is pretty tallying of
why you should get a good cooler for
these chips because at impact it's like
getting a good cooler for your GPU it's
starting to really matter and that will
impact the performance and benchmarks or
in gaming a lot actually I mean we're
looking at so so far let me recap the
numbers for those of you who are who
haven't been here since the beginning
very quickly 71 degrees Celsius might we
don't even need the Cinebench scores at
this point 71 degrees Celsius the
frequency was a bat was averaging 40
seventy-five megahertz 78 degrees
Celsius the frequency was averaging
about 40 50 megahertz rough numbers 59
to 63 degrees Celsius was averaging 41
50 so we're coming down now 55 degrees
Celsius was getting close to forty two
hundred thirty six degrees were 42 25 18
degrees were forty to fifty to forty
three hundred so that's a range of about
250 megahertz top to bottom which is
which is a lot I mean that's meaningful
for for performance impact so this is
all just precision booze to PBO is
disabled
so when I asked how long will that want
to stay in here if I don't use it I'm
not sure but at least a day for sure we
do truck we empty that mouth though at
the end of the session one to keep it
preserve it in two it's just not really
good to leave it exposed and an open
container anyway so temperature
monitoring is broken at this point we
are below zero on the CPU our clocks are
forty to seventy five to forty three
hundred and our score is now thirty
three oh three points which is not error
so we're gonna call it below zero we
can't actually see the temperature
anymore it says one point three but it's
bugged out 3303 and that was forty to
seventy five to forty three hundred so
that's probably going to be close to the
end of our scaling but let's let's drive
it down some more and see how low the
the frequency will keep scaling need to
fill up one of these pretty cool demo
though with I mean it really this is all
up until that last one was above ambient
it really starts to drive home how much
this stuff matters for rising three that
was in series I'm gonna get to chat in a
second I see you get amount of them
why not put something on top of the pot
if you mean like a fan it's because it
would get in the way oh this what
happened here huh I didn't notice it
stop spinning
but if you mean like a cover we don't we
don't want to cover it weird I don't
know what happened no whatever a fans
not working I don't know if it's a
motherboard bug or a fan issue let me
try and get this I'm just running the
fan to kind of get the exhaust here away
from the rest of the components so we
don't have too much stuff freezing over
nope fans dead okay well let me pull
that for a second
so we'll do the some lower temperature
test we're eventually going to hit a
cold issue and blue screen
but that won't be until probably like I
don't know maybe until the reader says
maybe minus 80 or 90 okay yes so let's
see we our pot temperature is minus 64
let's go ahead and just run it like that
4300 across most of the core is
constantly at this point I think we're
probably at the end of the scaling here
so minus zero still I guess I'll start
writing pot temperature at this point
and that score wow that is some scaling
3316 so we're still scaling you won't
move this oh yeah sorry
let's do another run no voltage settings
chain there's no frequency settings
changed just allowing the CPU to do what
it wants to do all the limits are in
place current limits are in place
temperature limits are in place north of
those are relevant so we're gonna we're
at 4300 flat now that - 76 pot
temperature so and that is we've stopped
scaling and score for the most part -
4300 flat so I think I mean I think
that's more or less the the
demonstration for scaling on precision
boost - let's just drive it down pot
temperature maybe - 90 I think we're
gonna blue screen here pretty soon
because I've had issues with this system
bugging out at - 90 pot temperature yeah
so it's it's Otsuka I mean it's just
straight 4300 the whole whole test and
that's up from an original like 40 50
megahertz for the 78 degree result or 40
75 for the net result that I did first
and we have stop scaling our where with
an error and the score all right so
there is your demo the next thing I need
to do is actually overclocked this and
that I personally thought that was the
most interesting because it's it's a
real demo up until the minus zero stuff
it's a real demonstration as our blue
screen real demonstration of how rise in
3000 scales frequency versus temperature
and hopefully that that kind of helps
you understand why you should actually
invest in a good cooler for these
because if you do run the stock cooler
although it may be capable and although
you might not be overclocking the end
result will be affected especially in a
bad case it kind of reinforces the the
reviews of bad cases we've done recently
alright so let me get some super chats
and store stuff and then start the real
overclocking couple orders like I said
if you order during the stream I'll try
and shout it out no guaranteed depending
on how many super chat I have to juggle
to you but I will try to do it
Joshua in Washington picked up a GM logo
shirt which is the one I'm wearing today
thank you for picking that up we had an
order from Wayne in Washington as well
picked up a teardown toolkit and a
medium mod mat thank you for that
Washington is popular today representing
Indiana
Seth picked up a keychain logo and I get
two more of these and then keep going
Nathan in Florida grabbed the a tear
down toolkit and then actually only got
two more of e-street total James from
Wisconsin grabbed the tear down toolkit
as well and then Jacob from Pennsylvania
grabs a tear down toolkit and the last
time I'm gonna read is Joseph from
Washington again Washington's busy today
with store purchases picked up a tear
down a mod bat and a toolkit thank you
okay so chat what are the do you do you
have 3800 acts note we're waiting until
it's available publicly
this is PBO only guys not any this is
not PBO this was precision boost so
again this this is why we need this this
is why the video has to exist on working
on PBO is not precision boost they are
different precision boost overdrive is
PBO precision boost to is part of the
CPUs native behavior so it was not a
scene that's that part of the comments
correct but it's also not PBO
we had PPO explicitly disabled so I want
to be really clear on that this was not
there was no overclocking here this was
stock behavior okay so hopefully that
that helps all right a couple super
chats and we need to get into BIOS here
I think Oh actually it's too cold so I'm
gonna need to torch this but let's let
it warm up a moment so you're not gonna
be able to hear me when that torch is
going crack on PC Hong Kong 25 thank you
very much is this 28 course 5 gigahertz
twist the secret chiller it's not and
the chiller is not very secret either
it's can you imagine if someone tried to
do a demo on stage with this kind of
like sitting there
and they just never mentioned it and
they led you to believe that was stock
frequency he'll be a little obvious
all right next bike $1 thank you that
calling guy $1 and again $1 from that
calling guy
Robin Jorgensen two dollars thanks for
all you do from Nebraska
thank you or maybe it's Jorgensen if
you're in Nebraska I'm flurry my dude a
50
I think Swedish kronor what's the Mac
safe voltage for the 3900 X when I was
he without Alan to the word around
reddit is one point three to five but
many youtubers went way beyond no idea I
don't have enough data yet I spoke with
some people some access years from AMD
about this question I did write down the
answer but I want to say they were
typically running 1.4 for their air over
clocks that doesn't mean it's safe as
far as many youtubers went way beyond
well I mean yeah because it gets the job
done and we just need to run it through
one round of tests but if you're using a
24/7 four years then P of it's safer on
it we found that our 3900 X did a 4.3
overclock at one point three five volts
was the the lowest we could go
let me read a couple more these bearded
Hardware 199 I want my $2.00 worth plug
the SSD in well Joe if you wanted two
dollars worth you should have given two
dollars not 199 but but you can get your
199 s worth when I say graded Hardware
has a YouTube channel and you should
watch them sometime
I'm gonna watch chat if this is like
unbearably loud I guess headphone
headphone warning its but if it's
unbearably loud let me know I'll meet my
mic so what I'm doing is torching the
pot because the temperature this this
board has issues booting when it is
above
sorry when it's below like 90 or so when
it's low 80 degrees pot temperature I
can't really get it to do so we just
need to torch that
warm it up so it'll turn back on okay -
56 we should be beautiful at this point
all right can you test skin on a PPO on
I'm not gonna do that
it's a you'll see why in our video we're
finalizing after this all right besides
it's neat is there a point to Ellen to
tests is it even possible to run an Alan
to set up to three things one the point
of this was pretty obvious we were able
to demonstrate scallion from eighty
degrees Celsius which is by the way
above ambient that's a normal operating
temperature down to negative something
eighty or so so yes I would say that is
a great use of volunteer as a utility a
second question can you run an Ellen to
set up sorta we did a game streaming or
a gaming benchmark like all the way
through the game test with Alan to on
our kingpin card and did actual
benchmarks with actual gaming with it
now as a practical no but it was
interesting no and then the third part
of it you can watch our video with the
overclockers on extreme overclockers
respond to mean comments and that was
the main when i asked them
okay let me get a couple of the comments
or the super chats Troy bolster or $1.00
I thank you vortex 1988 $5 any word on
one a 3,800 x review will be coming out
we need to be in possession of one first
it's cycling right now it's trying to be
should get there eventually so once once
we can get one the review will be out
actually mediocre overclocking $2.00
dami thick okay did hardware 199 I'm
gonna go for it scrolled up
I think that's telling tell I know Josh
comment I'm gonna go for versus I'm
gonna go at slack at the pool I'm gonna
go for V's I don't know okay we have
successfully booted so the reason it
basically the issue I discovered with
this setup yes yeah I don't know if it's
a CPU thing or board thing or a specific
CPU thing but it'll run fine and windows
up to a point till about minus 86 to 90
pot temperature the pot time ellentube
pot temperature is right here and that
thermocouples going into the base of the
L&amp;amp;T pot so when that says minus 90 ish
it blue screens from Windows and then if
it's below minus 60 or so I can't get
into BIOS so we that's why I was
torching the pot to heat it back up okay
so let's let's just change some actual
settings now now that we're done with
the precision boost not overdrive
demonstration all I'm doing is turning
off the over current protections and
that will allow us to set whatever
frequency and voltage we want without
running into a power limit let's just
let's just start at let's get a baseline
and it's do 1 point 4 volts and then
let's set it to I don't know
43 not 743 43 we're just gonna leave
memory set to XMP for this and we'll run
Cinebench doesn't really matter
I think that's all we need to do so
we're gonna get a baseline score what is
four point three do and this Cinebench
test and then from there we can start
tuning it a bit more yeah I should do an
action we have stock numbers two from
the previous tests all kinds of
temperatures so I need to make a note 43
at one point for which this chip can do
43 at one point three five so we're a
bit over but and then oh yeah Cinebench
score and the temperature is gonna
matter last at this point because we're
manually overriding it and doing all
core overclocking now so that should I
need to plug the SSD in that should be
bootable all right IRA science $2 thank
you nestled with the knife still don't
know how to say that it's Canadian five
dollars thank you what memory kit would
you suggest for the 3900 ax I'm looking
at upgrading this year and I'm looking
to get an idea I suppose it depends on
awful lot on budget memory is a lot
better than it was
we haven't done scaling tests yet but
we've done 3,200 and that seems to be a
good middle ground of fairly affordable
and also runs very well at low latency
so I would feel fine with recommending
3,200 I guess 36 is it's getting more
common now it's not as expensive as it
used to be so if you feel like you can
stretch for the money
the scaling tech power of did Destin
earlier on scallion for 32 to 36 and it
wasn't a whole lot but if it's like a
couple dollars different than whatever
two sticks is gonna be easier to work
with than four if you don't need
super-high capacities where you can
spread your pricing out of across four
sticks that might be better but if you
just need 32 or something you can do two
sticks and or 16 even but G skills tried
in Zeke it has been good for us Corsairs
kids have been okay but the Tritons eke
it tends to be a bit better of a on a
latency front
okay let me ask chat should we run arch
one if you want our 20 or our 15 for
this today what like I mean I know it's
just Cinebench so it's not particularly
useful but it's good for a benchmark so
what does I don't want to see the even
care for Cinebench why is it so slow
booting it was slow bidding because I
hadn't plugs the SSD in our 20 or our 15
waiting on chat to catch up okay
our 15 our 20 our same person saying our
15 or a lot of our 15s are 15 our 15
okay I've heard enough
our 15 to compare with the other results
we had that sounds good to me so where
are we we're at minus 40 pilot
temperature that should be fine
it'll be fast anyway I'll do a couple of
20 runs there's a good amount of people
asking for 20 I'll do a few of them
might not write them down as much
3377 that was at 4.3 all core and I
guess home write this down 43 77 okay
cool this should be pretty fun extreme
for demonstrating the scaling which is
the most useful part the most useful
aspect of the Ellen - okay
I wish well rise and master will work
for us for now it kind of stops working
at one point five five volts so we won't
be able to use it later on but we can
use it for now to get started one point
five five I don't know if there's maybe
chat can inform me if there's like some
special unlocked version or whatever but
no this is from my test yesterday so we
were at we were at four point three for
that one so let's just go ahead and type
in 4,500 is there a faster way to do
this - I'm not gonna have to type is
there like mirror speed up oh nice okay
perfect that's what I want so we're at
43 let's just go up to 45 now let's type
in for the voltage just go ahead and
type in all right one point for now
let's just type in one point five and be
done with it for a while anyway it's uh
apply okay running this in the
background will impact the score
assuming it even runs assuming the
system doesn't lock up I mean
you said 43 so thank you 43 77 is what
you set out yes yeah 33 77 was the score
thank you for noting that
yeah 33 77 not 43 77 standing pretty far
away from the monitor thank you for
pointing that out
okay all right super chats actually
mediocre overclocking a few dollars have
the other $3 $5 donations kept rejecting
Noah Richard $5 thanks for all the great
reviews working on my first build right
now that's awesome and I owe a lot of
what I learned to you guys well that's
cool to hear you're working on your
first build it's a good time to start
for sure stuffs pretty mature right now
the architect or the process at least on
Intel side the process is pretty mature
on AMD side the architectures brand-new
35:22 that is a lot of scallion I don't
remember what I typed it was it 45 X at
1.5 35:22 okay
and that's with what did I type in here
45 okay 45 hundred megahertz kind of
curious about actually about three mark
physics as well so we'll run one of
those and see what happens super chats
Matthew way $1 Thank You major nero 199
thank you not gonna read your comment
because i don't want you to be flagged
me for some recent JRA infinite MX 20
thank you how long for the restock of
3900 X I have no idea I haven't heard
anything about it and night raid oh
that's that uh wait interesting is that
brand new I've never seen that before
cool oh it's not plugged it's not
connected to the internet why why 3dmark
ever since underwriter laboratories
bought them I'm not gonna connect to the
internet for this it's not worth it okay
let's just do 46
and let's see if it's stable at 1.5
volts some people wanted an hour 20 run
I'll do one of those two for you but
well mostly that way you can compare to
other people who've done our twenty so
we saw some cool scaling earlier as a
recap for those started this is old
information for you but the original
demo I did was before we did any over
clocks at all and we saw scaling from at
about 78 degrees Celsius we were this is
all stock settings just precision Boost
doing its thing we were at 40 50
megahertz and then at still reasonable
ambient are still reasonable above
ambient temperatures 55 degrees Celsius
which he could achieve with a good
cooler we were at 4200 megahertz pretty
big difference there I think we're close
to the knife's edge on where this is
gonna be stable in terms of temperature
so let's just run it 1.5 I don't know if
it'll be enough but we'll find out so
this is our 15 I'll do an our 20 run for
those of you who want it and that it
goes 30 608 so it did that was that did
I apply those settings let's see
Wow yes but then I changed something
oh don't click on rise and master it'll
crash 30 608 I think is what I said 4.6
at 1.5 okay did it crash yes
and what else we need to
oh that's right I said our 20 let's see
if we can get rise and master to not
trip over itself since that's having
trouble booting I'm gonna launch
hardware info and check what frequency
we're actually running right now okay
well the system has decided that that is
not meant to be too cold this board or
CPU or something doesn't like being cold
it's let it get into BIOS and I'll do it
properly might have to torch the pot
again okay so someone said Neal Fraser
$2.00 Cinebench inna higher than my 2950
x3 head Ripper frowny face it's an
impressive chip JRA infinite oh I got
you
Zack gambrel when do you expect partner
model 5700 series cards if it's gonna be
a couple months I'm thinking of just
hybrid modding the reference model
August is what we understand and he has
officially said that as well it's 247 I
don't know if this let's do 1.5 - maybe
I just run like that for now okay
what's chat saying F for the crash no
our 24 us yes the system did not want to
allow it didn't want to allow chat to
get what it wants
dunsky what's better right now
overclocking with rise master or bios I
always prefer BIOS to answer that
question
Rison master appears to kind of work it
does crash sometimes even when you're
not doing this kind of overclocking so I
don't know I still prefer BIOS if you're
just trying to quickly guess and check
stuff rise and master is a good way to
do that and then what I would do is take
those settings and boot into BIOS and
apply them so that you don't need to run
it anymore even if it writes the UEFI or
whatever yeah I don't think we have to
torch it so you're good here
single core ok sure we will run single
core for you I'm just reading the normal
chat right now can you do a bunny hop
and a fakie at 2 million Hertz
I can barely even do a fakie our 20 is
what we were going to run for people
we're at 4.7 at maybe an unstable
voltage pot the temp is at minus 65 it's
doing all core I think this one takes
longer to run so I might have to monitor
it a bit more that's really not not
really getting that warm
okay and the official numbers up to 4.7
gigahertz I think it's 4.6 apparently
they expect everyone to use Holland here
well so a couple things 4.6 boost
doesn't mean all core actually it's not
a couple things it's it's just that
that's the only thing I wanted to say
hey 4.6 means one core and it's been
that way for a long time so anyone who
didn't know that might be new to the
scene I guess which is fine but
hopefully they know now 83 80 I don't
know I don't run our 20 but I guess I'll
write that down just in case and then
those who wanted a uh
how high can you Ollie I don't I don't
sit spikes we're talking bikes yeah I
don't do bunny hop in read the correct
terminology eighty three eighty sir are
twenty that was at four point seven one
point five two and for those of you who
wanted our twenty there you go let's run
a single core while I'm talking for a
while because some people wanted that
too
we're not gonna need much ellentube for
that one okay eighty three eighty all
right I 999 hundred K at five gigahertz
is forty nine ninety seven at one point
three thank you for the the quick
comparison there so according to chat a
ninety nine hundred K at five G is forty
nine ninety seven points this is eighty
three eighty this is a very threat bound
workload when you're doing the multi
threaded one someone got the clocks
hired by disabling the second CCD that
makes sense to me we'd say well the SMT
and got them higher to see super chats
toys are for boys 666 thank you let
there be no evil in your overclocking
gogo five gigahertz we're have four
point seven now so we should be good for
that
Daniel sterling two dollars see you at
LTX I love the content thank you and I
will see you there very soon I guess
like two weeks now ionic one dollar
Marta kiss forty to two dollars can you
hug the Ellen to you thanks
it's quite cold yes laughs yang cough
two dollars small support for all the
cool stuff you do Thank You Brandon
Green two dollars soldered ih asked
question work any plans for they could
metal it is soldered yes and no for this
liquid metal wouldn't work very well
liquid metal is it does not it scales
negatively once you go below zero so it
would actually worse to use it for this
for ambient testing or use the Cree
metal is a good solution for a lot of
things but I don't necessarily recommend
deleting the 3000 series processors you
can run it cooler with liquid metal
effectively always it's for a few
reasons
even when solder to the main one is
you've got that black silicon adhesive
layer if you look at the edge of the CPU
you'll see just like a black glue and
that is a silicone adhesive so if you
remove that what you do when you deal it
then you can run at a run the dyes
closer to the IHS but look at metal on
each side and the temperatures will be
better but is it worth it well on the
9900 K the answer was no I haven't done
that on this but I know Roman has okay
Steve a prior $1 mr. blonde $2 pepper
pepper you are Angus okay John beer club
$10 thank you looking for at maybe
building a first CAD workstation pods
Emperor by the way is minus 61 I'm just
kind of holding it there because it
seems to be alive at that and we're at
4.7 gigahertz just running a single core
right now first CAD workstation on
rising 3 over Xeon end of year I usually
run DCC what are my options or stay on
Xeon I understand rise and works with
the ECC but unofficial I honestly have
no idea I haven't followed ECC related
to Rison at all so unfortunately I don't
have really an answer for you
I can maybe speak to the performance and
ignore the ECC part of the question I
don't I guess you're saying you're gonna
build either a rising 3 or Xeon
budget-wise rising 3 if you just need
threads for some kind of workstation
workload it's a lot of threads for
pretty cheap if you need a higher
frequencies Zeon's not particularly high
frequency though intel can can get you
there but I don't know in the work
station tasks AMD is doing pretty well
like you're like dominating and a lot of
them part of that is the thread count
but then also can't really brush off the
cache because and our GCC compile tests
that's not really that thread or
frequency intensive it's cache intensive
which is why you see the 3600 and the
3900 acts pretty close to the same
result it's because of all that cash so
if your workload uses a lot of cash on
the cpu or that may be a good benefit
have 3 X 5 dollars what motherboard are
you using why did you pick it I mean you
think that X 5 so many master and chose
it because this is only been working
with the most since before launch so
pretty familiar with it
the vrm is more than enough for this we
don't need any cooling on it there's no
heatsink on it right now
part of that's because and the cold is
spreading like it sort of spreads from
the socket but the part of its cuz the
BRM is really good so that is that's why
we're running it familiar with it and I
know the VR I'm is good all right
well those of you who asked for single
thread at our 20 have really inflated
the length of this stream I think we're
not gonna run this too frequently it's
gonna be a probably just this one and
then maybe I'll do our 15 single thread
after this cuz that's a bit less
agonizing but we're more than a halfway
there so we might as well add a finish
sorry for those of you who didn't care
about this and I want to see
multi-threaded but we'll limit these
just because of the time it takes to run
them try let's a bunch of new people
I've joined let me do the quick Alan to
you like
explanation and safety talk yeah and
although this is going very fast now
okay I'm it's slowing down we're hit and
miss depending on the 3d objects on the
scene so a lot of new people in the in
the stream to go over it again and I'm
sorry for repeating the information but
the common questions are what does it
cost for Alan to why don't you wear
gloves and and then just like what's the
dangerous aspect if any so what does it
cost
answer first that 180 litre tank is a
little under $180 and that'll last us
without any use just letting it sit
there it'll if it's if it's kind of a
not great tank which that one isn't
it'll last us maybe two months before it
fully leaks out and you don't have any
left and otherwise we just try to use it
as fast as we can it's chamber within a
chamber its runs at like 22 psi or so is
like I get a low psi tank and we're
currently a little under halfway full
this is a transfer hose we connect this
into the Allen the Dewar I'm not gonna
do that right now because it'll be loud
and transfer hose like four hundred
dollars to answer that question goes
into the Dewar the doers also like six
this was six hundred I think Dewar
contains 30 liters and that's got maybe
50 to 80 left something like that and
who the hell asked for a single core
score well a lot of people sorry we're
gonna let it finish that'll keep going
we're close now there it's getting there
it's really struggling on that couch but
once it hits the walls it's good so then
the questions about things like safety
or even just how it behaves so Ellen to
pretty much evaporates right away when
it contacts something unless you pour it
into a container where it's just
contacting other Ellen to on all sides
so there's yeah it's gone like that's
pretty much it so evaporates right away
this leads into the next demo that I've
done already but if you get on your skin
as long as it doesn't soak it doesn't
hurt so that's called the Leidenfrost
effect and it's just it hits your skin
evaporates pretty much or slides off and
doesn't hurt if you get it if it soaks
like if it soaks your shirt your sock
especially that'll hurt then it'll get
stuck to your foot if you're soaking
your sock and I'll - that's very bad so
that's the the point where you would be
concerned and then we need a bit more in
here we're at minus 58 it's really not
hot though I mean low power consumption
for single thread workload go figure
and then the question of ventilation it
is displacing oxygen when you've got a
bunch of it but we're in a big open
space with
ac running constantly so that is not a
concern for us if you're like doing this
in a tiny room you would definitely want
fans in there to to ventilate the air
well because if I mean it's like
anything else if you don't have enough
oxygen you die so but if you in a big
room with AC no issue at least for us I
think that pretty much explains the
Helen to you
so now we sit and wait what gloves thank
you
why no gloves let's do this one more
time I'm only doing this one more time
for this dream I did at the beginning
but there's like 4,000 more people then
at the beginning of the stream so we'll
just do it one more time
first thing if you use gloves at all
with Allen - you would not use something
like this like just a leather workers
glove because that is not sufficiently
protected so it would if you get enough
on your hand on the glove Allen see that
is same thing as with the sock it'll
bond it to your skin and hurt a lot so
it's the soaking that's the concern this
stuff so this is a cryo glove it's what
you would actually need to use I don't
use them for one primary reason one well
two primary reasons you just saw me pour
it on my arm and it didn't hurt to is
handling this stuff gets really
difficult with these gloves because
they're thick because they have to be
and it's difficult to pour some be
blessed accurate which is bad for the
system's health and it's also harder to
handle so I mean like getting your hand
out of there is a is a little bit more
dangerous here so my argument is it's
more dangerous to use the gloves than
not because of that dexterity issue
anyway that's the explanation
so hopefully that hope for that that
should cover for now hi oh we have a
score Wow I had forgotten we were doing
anything thanks Chad 540 to hide points
I don't do our 20 you can let me know
what some I guess we have these not
great numbers on the side 7700 K that is
not a relevant comparison at all 476 so
you can someone in chat go ahead and
post some numbers but I'll just go ahead
and write this down at before that was
four point seven one point five two for
what it's worth
549 single okay alright that's enough
yes that's enough for this let's get a
let's get a higher clock going we can
maybe revisit single thread at the end
once we have our final stable all core
although you can push a single one
higher anyway but we won't do that today
I have a couple free super chats here
you go from Danny B'nai banany thank you
okay I need to do some super chats and
store stuff like a set a few it's
unplugged recipe I might have to torch
the Helen teapot here no we should be
good actually
- 57 if you buy from the store during
the stream I will try to shout it out no
guarantee but I will try to get them
stored on gamers Nexus dotnet for things
like our new toolkit this is still
booting I might have to torch that Allen
teapot actually so the GPU teardown
toolkits up there it's got 10 tools in
it we use a CRV for these tools we use
an a3 steel for the hex heads and that's
because we have to custom grind them
down to make sure they clear the
capacitors on the back of PCBs so that
was a that was our our design to grind
them down like that and on the CRV for
the others is as a higher strength steel
and they come with some cards with
basics on how to disassemble most of the
modern GPUs and you get the cool tool
kit to with the GN GPU teardown diagram
on it so let's let's light this up a bit
to get it to boot well that was the
other thing I didn't do in the LNT
demonstration Jackie and the oxygen in
the room can you can you light a torch
yes or no if you can then you're
probably good ok
sorry it's gonna be loud for a second so
headphone warning turn them down for a
second what I'm doing is torching the
onto pot and that is to get the system
bootable this the system again don't
know if it's a board CPU or what doesn't
like booting if it's too cold
so that should get us there should be
able to turn on our -38 at this point
3470 is that multi-core I can give you
the multi-core loads we had a results in
our 28 just 4.7 of 83-84 what that's
worth and then scaling wise we were at
when we did the above ambient
demonstration when we were at 30 sorry
when we had 78 degrees
we had a score of 30 140 that was at 40
50 megahertz went to 70 131 74 points
that was at 40 50 to 40 100 average 40
seventy-five megahertz came down to 55
degrees that put us at 32 46 points for
our 15 which was 42 hundred megahertz or
so so that should kind of recap everyone
let's just push it up to 49 let's set
that to 1.6 and just see if this boots
and then after that see if it works
- do you feel that what is the humidity
45% right now so we're actually in a
pretty good environment for this yeah I
guess that point the real like danger of
Allen 2 is just damaging components so
I've insulated everything the board has
vaseline all over it
I see the super chats look at those in a
minute and that's to protect it from
mostly from the condensation forming up
here the cool thing about liquid
nitrogen versus the chilled water we've
done is that it freezes and so it's not
really - not really too much of an issue
until it starts to melt but you
obviously still don't want your boards
in contact with water
one second to fill this and then we
should be good to go
it's a try 4.9 it's a booting or what
it's trying to be cycling there it goes
okay cool
just started at 5.5 and work your way
down that's not really how it works you
don't just go like let me start at my
best overclock and then figure out the
lowest I can run how did you even why
would you even do that r15 I guess let's
see if it works four point nine one
point six volts just do a multi-threaded
so we don't torture everybody again let
me get some super chats nope
doesn't like it probably need to put
onto in the pot it's at minus thirty but
we do need to be colder so let's try
that again without any changes and just
cool it down the good news is it should
boot without a cold this year
all right so we stopped the messages at
xes $10
is it true Navi does not support
crossfire wondered how long it would be
before you put 3900 X under Allen - good
job thank you I'm not sure I asked AMD
is crossfire supported when we did the
tech day for Navi and the same product
team that was heavily misinformed I
found out later on a lot of other things
also told me that crossfire support
would be the same as it has been which
was their way in my understanding of
saying it'll work but we're not going to
actively build for it so I would take
that as yes but I've seen the stories on
it not working so I don't know but these
are the same team members who told me
that power play tables wouldn't work
anymore and then they did so I mean
maker pick of that what you will I guess
I'm gonna bring this down to minus 65 or
so maybe let's try and do can we try and
do like a top-down shot of the ellentube
BOTS you think you can pull that off so
it's pretty cool literally I guess but
this is their Bauer's bu style onto pop
that's the name of it and it it's got a
lot of holes in there for wider surface
area so the LNT soaks pretty fast which
is great and that just means that with
the wider surface area L&amp;amp;T comes into
contact with more of the metal obviously
so I can cool things down a lot more
effectively and we're gonna try and get
a close-up shot in a second give us a
moment to move the camera around you
know me to hold that
so here's a we're gonna try a top down
hopefully the HDMI feed doesn't fall out
risky all right give us one second here
you go so there's the Allen teapot
that's Romans they're bauer beast that
was a little much good for video though
and that's that's how quickly it
evaporates with no load and then you've
got all the surface area
drilled out in there so that's all I
wanted to show I check the chat master
by eros yes that is what we are using do
or that is open thanks I'll get that you
got it okay
okay that's pretty good shot tank lid
tank lid I got it thank you okay so did
we even run yet no I'm gonna run this
where I land you're setting the camera
back up let's see if it survives it
might need more voltage if not think
we're at 1.6 yeah it needs more voltage
and 4.9 so we'll bump it up to 1.65
million
yeah definitely let's try one more time
just in case we get lucky but I'm
thinking that means more voltage is
needed we can't use rise master for this
because it stops at one point five five
volts which is odd because at one point
five five you're every bit as likely to
kill the processor has that beyond that
it's kind of a weird cutoff around that
time 33 sorry thirty eight thirty to
thirty eight thirty two is what we got
that was four point nine let me write
that down because we are keeping track
here that's our fifteen four point nine
at one point six I think and thirty
eight thirty two so then for scaling we
had stock let's do like for like stock
at Sub Zero was forty three hundred
megahertz that was a 33-19 score stock
stock like at a reasonable temperature
say sixty degrees 60 degrees was 3205
stock 43 X all core was 33 77 45 X with
35 22 it's pretty clean scallion 30 30
608 for 4.6 gigahertz and then 38:32 for
4.9 gigahertz and let's do an R 20 for
those of you who want to compare to the
more modern test that runs pretty quick
since it's multi-core it's we're not
gonna do single core again and fall for
that trap super chats using PBO to OC
instead of all core o seen now but
earlier when you probably sent that
message we're using precision boost
which is explicitly different from pbl
precision boost is not pbl high it's
precision abuse is part of the CPUs
native functionality I know I keep
saying that but it's like a really wide
spread it's it's an AMD problem it's not
like the users fault
it's AMD didn't do a good enough job
they should have probably given them
different names so yeah but to answer
your question it wasn't PPO but it was
precision abused yes it was just native
processor performance
two dollars recycled $10 nvidia waiting
for big navvy to unveil a 28 ECI super I
have no idea if they're even doing a 20
atti super we haven't heard anything
about it
Aly Robertson $2.99 how do they chill
quantum computers 2.03 Kelvin I have
absolutely no idea
hahaha that is outside of my area of
expertise
87 74 points for our 20 for those who
care at 4.9 I know that liquid so I mean
I can give some numbers I don't know
what the answers your question is I'm
sorry this stuff liquid nitrogen is
about minus 196 degrees Celsius liquid
helium I think is for Calvin chat can
correct me if that's wrong I think it's
for Cal quick Google tell us liquid
helium temperature yeah
for Calvin that so I don't know what
they're doing for quantum computing Ivy
Mike $5 so what you're saying is I
should run an air tube okay see it to my
AIO intake yes that's what we're trying
to say here you should actually
disconnect the dot you should block the
ducts that go everywhere else in the
house and run one line from the AC
straight into your computer it would
perform well Adam Ballinger your $2 so
prism isn't enough be quiet cooler
needed then yeah I mean a prism is like
enough in so far as with the CPU it
ships with it will run but if you want
the higher frequencies we would
recommend the better coolers I'm gonna
do a couple more of these and we'll do
some more actually you might as well
just reboot and get that process started
and I'll do some of these while we're
going up to 5 which is the next number
I'm trying trusty $2 youtube premium
gave me a free super chat here thank you
I forgot about this I forgot they you
threw premium gives you those basher and
Zee $5 New Zealand thank you what size
radiator would you think suitable in a
custom loop which included a Vegas 64 I
think well I don't you haven't told me
your CPU but let's just assume a
relatively maybe like a 3900 ax900 K
something like that relatively warm
- hot I think you'll be fine with like a
360 or if you can't fit that maybe - 240
is something like that probably fine
honestly with let's call it a 360 is
kind of where I cut it off I guess a
fine and ideal I guess for two different
things - but 50x let's try it at one
point six just I don't think this will
work because we were already having
issues but let's try it at one point six
and see if it if it can complete the
test and if not we'll go to one point
six five or something Chad how are you
using liquid nitrogen yes
what else is in I'm just reading the
normal chat right now what's your
runescape mains levels someone says well
back over a decade ago oh man oh it's
probably more like I don't know like
2000 maybe played that I was really good
at fishing and wood cutting that's what
people care about right right we're
having food issues so I need to warm
this up so I can boot and then we will
be able to do the test so headphone
warning for you Chad says the hold 5
gigahertz yes yes behold a black stream
and a torch inside of a frozen alan - 5
go hold 5 gigahertz I think we need more
voltage but I really do want to I'm
being optimistic here I think if we go
up to one point six five to one point
seven we'll be good when our mod mats
off backorder the medium mount mod mats
we have in stock and the large ones I
think we've got a note on the store
they're being made googling store does
not get me to where I want to be they're
being made I think we are looking at
roughly arriving on September 6th
is the is like the very long
conservatively lawn estimate might be
before then but it's the problem so the
problem we ran into is with the tariff
increase we had to find ways to save
money without sacrificing anything and
the best way to save money is to ship by
boat instead of air it takes a lot
longer but then we don't have to
increase the prices which is good does
that change from air to boat saves the
difference that we more or less spend on
the the increased tariffs yeah we
definitely need to increase the voltage
I think so let's get back into BIOS
while that's getting back into BIOS a
couple store orders I'll shout out if
you pick up something from store
documents access net like the GN toolkit
or the mod map that we're working on
today then I will try to shout it out
man Joe's trick of unplugging bearded
hardware's trick of unplugging the SSD
is really good for this so we definitely
need to increase this not doing anything
with SOC you don't care about it okay
and let's just turn X and P on and leave
it alone and then 1.65 maybe 45.0 Jane
from Indiana picked up a teardown
crystal thank you for picking that up we
have those 3d laser engraved crystals
with the GN teardown logo it's got
MOSFETs and stuff like that in it on
store doc here is X Donna let Daniel
from where what is this province
none of it Canada cool
picked up a couple of the blue beer
glasses that we have on the store the
cobalt blue with the gold rim okay 50 at
1.65 plugged in the SSD this time I read
one more of these Jesse from New Zealand
picked up a GPO artifacting sure that's
a classic one that one is the one we
made for well 20 series when it was
already faxing a lot but it's on the
store
doesn't have the disappointment text on
the back anymore it's just the Lok the
artifacting logo all right what's chat
saying how's normal chat doing should I
actually buy Andi stock right now I have
no idea and I have no comment on stock
market the lid it's closed I think we
need to be colder and we might need more
voltage although I don't want to go to
cold and I'm trouble getting into BIOS
and I need to get on the BIOS
raising the Infinity fabric voltage will
help you bring the temps further down
okay we're not doing any infinity fabric
right now by the way for those who who
were asking I did um to answer the
question how fast have you gotten it I
did just 1866 with basically stock
settings before do anything else I
thought the 3900 X was supposed to
launch on the seventh no German retailer
has them yet and on Andy's store they're
out of stock and the idea what's going
on now you need more voltage I guess
it's a limited supply issue and then
maybe Amy just favored other markets or
something not really sure
shwayne got the tri-blend classic GN
shirt yesterday him love it well thank
you for picking that up
it's our oldest design the GN classic
one so what I'm gonna do is increase the
voltage a bit and see what happens we're
so close to the the the rumored five
Giga everyone remember when these CPUs
were supposed to run at five gigahertz
based on the rumors that we're very
obviously not going to be true
we're almost there it only took this
JW Dickie send $5 it hurts to pay 80
plus USD for a screwdriver set but I
love you guys it's 54 the normal one I
guess maybe if you're shipping
internationally or something
shipping is is not an easy problem to
solve as we've learned when you're a
small company it's expensive you kind of
forget how expensive it is when you get
used to buying everything from Amazon
where it's free
all right so hopefully it will boot this
time without needing to torch the
container again Jeff Lavin oh and thank
you by the way JW Dickey said we were
picking up the toolkit I think you might
have been the one asking for the the
beanie as well which we do need to we
have the design I haven't moved on it
though
Jeff 1100 $10 I can't thank you enough
for all the work you do and expertise
you share well thank you for watching we
try to make it look like we have
expertise but right now Systems not
booting at the desired 5 gigahertz
although I do know it will run there
so just gonna warm it up so we can turn
this thing on
what was that Adam Savage quote am I
missing an eyebrow
all right did the ln2 till the chipset
fan no it's running it's pretty loud too
that's why Neil anyway so we're doing we
did four point nine successfully
let's give us a cold boot and we're
trying to do 50 which I am pretty sure
it can do someone says yes I work in
logistics and Amazon has really skewed
people's expectations on shipping cost
that is for damn sure
it's skewed mine a lot we started
shipping the products in from from the
factories and you're kind of like wow
and that's the good price all right make
a large mouse mat yes we do want to do
that it's cycling and it's trying to
boot we may end up in a BIOS if it's
unhappy with these settings okay someone
says I have dual moti ins as hi it's
1:45 a.m. in the UK please say hi hi if
you talk while torching it makes the
torching loads quieter I thought so
that's good to hear though thank you I
will make sure I do that there we go
not sure what frequency we are right now
Windows 10 is going to abuse as a whole
but we'll get there eventually it's
gonna do a thing where it says it's
repairing it yeah okay last restart my
pc or do we have a continue into Windows
yes so hopefully that will boot at one
point six eight or whatever I set Helen
teapot temperature 38 - thirty-eight
stupid chat last one was from where DK
dual in Zalman 499 does the cpu wattage
used go up or stay the same during boost
with the only lower temperatures to
voltages change great content as always
Patrick did we did you look
into that with PBO did you hear the
question we don't think of a full answer
here but the question was basically does
the voltage change as the clocks go up
without any manual chain he was
specifically asking about temperature
but did you see voltage change at all
with those settings with ppl just
leaving it alone right just turning PBO
on and so changes with PBO and then as
far as does the power consumption change
with lower temperature as well you have
less power leakage from lower
temperatures so I'm not sure I'd have to
measure it we could clamp it maybe but
it definitely should be lower just from
lower power leakage you get about 4
percent reduction in power leakage for
every 10 degrees Celsius which would
then be power that can go into the chip
instead if it's hitting some kind of
current limit miss precision boost let's
give this a little colder so we're gonna
try and do we're finally in Windows
we're at 5.0 we're at 1 point 6 8 volts
we're gonna finally try and hit that
magic that fabled 5 gigahertz number I
know Joe stefan's he's gone beyond this
but he has been working on this a lot
longer and he's also been on to
overclocking since literally Norse
mythology was invented because he is in
fact Odin - 56 bring down some more I
think I want this at like maybe - 65 or
70 don't want to push too far because
then it all blue screen also pushing too
far too fast will cause at the blue
screen let's see if that'll do it - 73
we're doing our 15 I don't have high
hopes but it does appear to be
functioning so are we going to get our 5
gigahertz number one point six eight
volts Lowell yes it is quite high I
would not recommend ever running at that
voltage for daily use so it worked does
the does the score match the alleged
frequency no he
absolutely does not so we are actually I
think BIOS must have reset then let's
see that that is the score of us a stock
run at minus 76 and so if we run this
I'm thinking that BIOS might have reset
itself yep so let's let's do that again
everyone had such high hopes 5 gigahertz
except actually for 4300 because of
precision abuse - okay how is the
voltage not fried the CPU
I thought the review sample died with
less we didn't have a review sample die
but because it's really cold that's how
it's I mean I certainly even if you ran
out on to constantly I wouldn't run at
this kind of this kind of voltage for a
long year so this is a benchmarking
voltage is what this is because it's
it'll work but you'll definitely degrade
the chip over time you start pushing
high voltages and it's just not good for
it but it's but it's fine for running
benchmarks in a stream okay turning off
all the overcurrent stuff we're gonna
try this again so you could see the
boots without any it's I mean it's
booting into BIOS now so I'm hoping
we're past the cold issue and at this
point if it doesn't go then it's a
voltage then maybe 1.5 hours and we have
not seen a third to run yet there have
been a lot more we've done 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
8 9 12 13 we've done 15 runs but we only
did one of single-threaded 4.3 is the
new 5 can someone explain the torch yes
so I use this when it's having issues
booting because it's too hot there it's
sorry too cold I try to get it hotter
I kissed I guess it feels hot if you
touch it it's minus 90 it feels pretty
hot
so that is a system will run window is
that like - 80 Allen teapot temperature
but this is not gonna work we need to we
need more voltage or something but it
will not boot if it's at that same
temperature so that is the reason for it
makes it a bit faster let me do some
super chats while this gets to 1 point 7
volts now howdy folks Gaming $5 after 30
minutes of gaming my be 350 west 7/8
3700 axe crashes and he guess why tried
tinkering and bios but to no avail
successfully gaming for 30 minutes and
then crashing does sound like thermal to
me that's that sounds like a thermal
behavior so that would be the first
thing I'd look at vrm it could be vrm
thermals instead of cpu thermals so
basically if the MOSFETs are running at
whatever their their shut off time
t.j.maxx you have the MOSFETs running at
t.j.maxx
the motherboard made just override and
shutdown so that would be a likely
possibility with the 350 board if it's
not a good board and then the other
possibility is the CPU having a thermal
issue so those would be the places I'd
look what you could do is put a fan
blasting straight up the vrm just for
long enough to to test that theory and
if it boots or if it doesn't shut down
after that point then you know it's a
PRM thermal issue so you I just shove a
fan on the top of the case and blast air
in or something if it doesn't flick too
much with your air cooling your CPU
cooling setup I just hitting delete on
this keyboard yep BIOS but that is not
the right keyboard so we need to boot
and then we need more voltage and then
we need to hit 5 gigahertz the garland
family in two dollars just bought the
awesomeness Nexus shirt merch thank you
sir Merc $10 with the soft power plate
tables unlock Navi graphics buy Igor's
lab which I'm a sizeable performance
boost with very little power increased
mmm
are you thinking of testing that out
well we've done power play table mods
for every other Andy launch recently so
you could you could assume so it's
cycling right now so once it cycles
enough to realize it's not working then
it'll get into by us actually we could
probably just hit the I guess I was
gonna hit the clear CMOS what about the
board are using I came in late from
Kevin wise 109 thank you we are using
the gigabyte x57 ers master and we are
being limited elsewhere right now 1.70
you know I I forgot to raise the DRM
voltage earlier which may have been some
of the issue but we'll just run with it
at 1.7 anyway even though it might have
been a dear and voltage issue okay see
you see if it boots at five how far back
are we we're about one hour back on
super chat so let me get caught up on
these for a moment
Gabriel Wayne $2.00 Thank You Seth
Tainan five dollars says thanks Steve
well thank you Seth you just have wrists
two dollars well game is excess copper
cops come back no current plans we have
enough other stuff in the production
pipeline that I I can't focus resources
on it right now
all-around good guy OH - $10 million a
key rip J soon question mark showing
support from Nunavut that's two of you
today yes we I'm actually gonna be on a
live stream with EVGA a charity stream
with with Jay and kingpin will be there
and we're gonna be doing some
overclocking so that's on a Tuesday this
week 20 hour livestream and I'm probably
gonna be there with Jay for about six to
ten of them we're not quite sure yet so
that will be on EB Jays Channel for sure
and then we're gonna try and stream it
as well it's not happy we might need to
check the pace contact or something I
had it at five briefly yesterday but
only enough to test it
but 4.9 is what we've gotten so far and
it's boot cycling let's try it lowering
the memory frequency just to give some
room for it to reduce variables we're
dealing with CMOS where's clear CMOS
okay really want the five gigahertz that
rumor said we would get we were promised
five gigahertz where's my five gigahertz
has he got five yet no we got 4.9 it's
not quite enough
okay well let's trying the boot with a
bench okay all right
warm it up again you're good Patrick and
we will I guess try this with a lower
memory frequency just just to kind of
make it a little easier
I really just I want point one higher
except asking so much all right so while
I'm hoping this is gonna be it at the
memory change once we get it into BIOS
let's see Cordell Roberts $1 Thank You
Cole $1.99 thank you will be worth
getting a 3,800 October 3700 I kind of
doubt it but we don't have one so I
can't definitively say at this time I'm
not I'm gonna run XMP right now let's
just let's just like see if it boots at
at a start one point six 850 and then
see if that works no XMP no no nothing
just frequency on the CPU
what was that question I had 3800 X over
3700 X so like I said I think it's gonna
be a scenario like the 2700 experts is
the 2700 but I don't have it yet so I
don't know we'll post a review as soon
as we get it in and actually I should
know for those of you watching the
stream we're gonna post another CP
review today as soon as the stream ends
it's done it's uploaded it's ready to go
so as soon as the stream is starting to
end I'll I'll set it live and link it in
chat for you so that's another CPU full
review start to finish review for it
well for the most part but 3800 X is not
one we presently have boot failure
detected because there's no SSD okay
enter BIOS please don't change anything
thank you okay
a lot of 3800 ax questions at which I
guess is just because no one's had one
so I think maybe one or two reviewers
have them but we don't have any local
stores that carry hardware feet of
hardware so we have to wait for the
online retailers to get them in dr. Sam
$0.99 thank you and again our next bike
$1 Thank You Jerry infinite what cooler
will you recommend with the 3900 acts in
a case with reasonably good cooling
which is actually important for these
CPUs as we demonstrate out the first
half of the stream and we'll recap in
next few videos in a case with
reasonably good cooling the crack in X
62 or similar 280 millimeter CLC's with
fans more or less maxed out
seems like it works pretty well so we
didn't have issues with that one so I
would say about a 280 with with decent
fans in a reasonable case meaning one
that's not like choked off in the front
panel I'm gonna bring this down we're
booted now finally at probably 5.0
depending on based on last time see is
it actually 5.0 or is it lying to me
it's 5.0 everybody look it's happening
in the very least you can get to desktop
and idle at 5 gigahertz we've done it we
have achieved the fables 5 gigahertz
clock so next it needs to actually do
something now this is a 3900 X so it's
gonna be a bit harder to do stuff on
this one but what we say to the god 5.0
or not today
HSS anyone know what power supply that
is that is the NZXT Hale 9 TV - I doubt
you can even get them anymore at a price
that makes sense they're old but good
okay well - 68 let's run it just
instantly gonna shut down
then shut down but it did crash so let's
get temperature a bit lower that was a
fast fast fail
we did it chat says 5.1 next
good air cooler for the 3900 X what's
you cold too fast that's sex well we
know we can do it now it's just a matter
of not cold bugging the system good air
cooler just got in as this five
gigahertz without a Ln yes there's five
gigahertz without liquid nitrogen there
is no liquid nitrogen involved in this
process none at all
it is stock that's the question I think
maybe a Noctua and HQ 14 or something
like that would be good I just wasted
that Hans gonna have to torch it but it
wasn't worth it
so we did hit 5 gigahertz and it was
idle stable now we need to get it back
into the BIOS and I don't think this is
a voltage issue at this point I think
it's a pot needs to be the right
temperature cuz it was running it's just
i cooled it down too fast too too low
and then a cold bugged and so we're
going to try and not do that this time
we're currently at a we were at one
point seven volts
but we could go a bit higher if we end
up needing it
it's just cold bugs then you pour more
well yeah I mean the like I was asking
if we're using liquid nitrogen I wanted
to show that we weren't all right this
is actually just hot water for us and on
the pot is it still hot water then I
don't know how does it still become is
it still considered hot water Joe ran
his 3700 I accept full pot after CB
resolved itself yeah we were talking
about that he's actually beyond five
nine thing cuz I like 5.2 on his 3700 X
I need to get him up here though uh
bearded hardware if you don't know who
that is Daniel Anderson $10 is my
favorite tech channel how far back a
mile an hour still thank you love it two
things one looking up an anoxia a deep
silent 3 case for my 39 x build any
familiarity with it no but let me look
it up and to your celebrity look-alike
is Jason Segal okay thank you
no noxee a deep silence 3 I'm not
familiar with it looks rather closed off
in the front which concerns me so get a
good cooler on there if you're doing
like a rise in 3 CPU as we demonstrated
earlier in the stream it does matter
look at how fast that it evaporates
super fast after the pots been torched
so we're gonna try and not go too cold
too fast this time I'm just gonna do it
in baby steps John 10 $5 Thank You Josh
$45 is it worth to get the x5 70 board
right now instead of X 4 70 great
question do you need PCIe gen 4 if your
answer is why would I need that or no
then get something else you can save
money that way if your answer is I don't
know maybe in the future then it's worth
considering but if you want more detail
on that builds I'd spent the first I
think is just the first three minutes of
our best motherboards for Rison 3000
video which just went up yesterday just
you don't even need to watch the whole
thing if you don't want just watch the
first three minutes or so and he answers
that piece yeah it should I get X 570
question pretty
so his answer is more or less no unless
you need the storage speed or something
but good question
Daniel Thorpe $2.00 heard anything about
the new AP is was n 2 plus Nabi yes we
are testing them right now but I don't
know how they're doing so we'll find out
hopefully in the next couple days trying
to bring it down slowly
that was pretty slow with you all right
maybe one point seven two volts maybe
that's what we need
why the 30 to 60 minute delay do you see
how much is going on I'm waiting for the
thing to work and it's requiring a lot
of like well a few things one is I try
to interact with the normal chat - and
not just paywall it so I want everyone
to be able to participate in our streams
obviously the volume of comments means
it's impossible but I do my best to
interact with all of the forms of
engagement now we were only at one point
six eight nice the other one is actually
doing the tests and like set up focusing
on it does take a bit of attention so I
try to keep Oh further I try to keep it
interesting because like if you're just
watching any tune in and it's ten
minutes of reading super chats that's
that's kind of boring for people who
aren't the ones who gave the money to
get their question answered so try to
keep all that in mind to answer the
question you had let's see would the
Sebastian would the courser vendôme 3000
be enough for a 37 or dex it would be
enough yes I mean you could always do
better but that's certainly fine you're
not gonna be that limited by it Irish
giant $5 new video idea extreme
overclockers respond to me and my
comments we did that now I see never
mind side note what cpu are you using
well played so I think the problem is
when you make a change and then you
reboot even though it's state it gets to
bio so it's not a cold bugging I think
if the SSD isn't plugged in there's an
issue with post or something is my guess
as to why we sometimes have issues when
it doesn't quite make sense with booting
that is what does this think the issue
is as cycling so say DRAM DRAM but
cycling okay well I hate this part
because it's gonna feel like we're so
close for a very long part of the stream
with nothing happening with the first
half of the stream having really cool
information in the middle having pretty
good information and then the last part
of its always just like that final push
of trying to try to get the goal we set
out to but I think we will get there
just a matter of getting everything to
play nice together so that we can make
our final push to stay below 5 gigahertz
so this like I said before is just to
heat it up so it'll turn on and
hopefully that will do the trick
okay that's straight into BIOS up the
settings again plugs SSD and reboot
corbin brook my first super chat Thank
You Corbin Martin Delia $5 is there a
possibility to damage the CPU if it's
constantly run at near zero degrees
planning to run a custom water loop with
near freezing ambient temperatures geez
no not really the issue you'll run into
is your SSD lifespan if you're on a zero
degrees you you're cutting it I don't
remember the exact math on it
I talked to Alan mal ventano about it
previously but you're cutting that as a
STIs lifespan significantly by going
down to zero so SSDs like to be operated
while flash the flash likes relatively
warm temperatures but the controller
should be kept a bit cooler so if the
flash is too cold the memory then you
will cut the lifespan on it so that's
your only consideration but if the SSD
is not under your loop then I guess it
should be fine it'll just be whatever
the case ambient temperature is I think
it might it sounds like the chipset fans
working properly this time it's what my
boot looks promising
I'm a flurry in my dude 20 Swedish
kronor that here is their advantage to
bio so Verizon Master yeah Verizon
Master the voltage stops you can't
change it once you get to one point five
five so that is the that is the
advantage okay let's try this one more
time I'm leaving
I'm not even enabling XMP anymore and
we're not doing anything with memory
1.71 I guess and then all this stuff
okay I think we need to spend some of
the super chat money on food after this
stream front seat racing 20 kronor thank
you what's our pot temperature it is
currently 33 - 33 so we'll leave it
there
and see if it will boot
it is it is trying though I see it it's
getting into the boot LEDs so it's
trying to go and it has an SSD now so it
might do it David rose $2.00 Thank You
Adam yeah ten dollars in the daily and
my in case of daily use or its extreme
or God like man those are both so
high-end for daily use it's this you
don't need either a toast I don't know I
think honestly it comes down to like do
you want the animated screen like the
jiff playback screen fight me if you
don't like my pronunciation or do you
want the note chipset fan like the
extreme I think that's kind of like what
it mostly comes down to at that point
for daily use that's the season by the
way so why don't use conformal coating
to protect the motherboard because we're
using Vaseline instead so there's
Vaseline all over the socket area nice
and on the backside of the board this is
further than we've gotten in a while
your PC ran in it's so sad it's like it
was trying to say its last words and
couldn't quite make it yeah so no
conformal coating needed with the
Vaseline I do have actually eraser on
there too that deformable eraser uh
hackneyed I got you Erik easterly I'm a
machinist and quality engineer only
reason I haven't picked up a tool kit or
a mod mat is because I already have the
same quality tools yeah there's a lot of
a lot of tool options out there we
obviously tailored the tool kit to use
with things like video cards but I can
respect that if you are a machinist you
would have quite the collection of tools
grr monkey $1 thank you derp of things
199 are you thinking about using TR 3/4
rip J I don't know that I mean I think
we're gonna be stuck on the 3175 x for
awhile for that that's a pretty
it's the frequency that that matters for
those tests we do
it's gonna it's gonna go to that bio
okay I thought I was gonna go to the bio
screen okay all right so is it a cold
issue there's a voltage issue
we're at the we're at the patients part
of trying to hit five gigahertz but as
you recall all the rumors said five
gigahertz Spock we're trying I know Joe
has been there with the 3700 axis seems
a bit harder with a 39 we haven't used
that much Helen to you though this is
really it doesn't run that hot even with
these these high frequencies and
voltages it's just not running that hot
compared to some of the other stuff
we've worked with okay well at least
we're consistently getting to a blue
screen that's better than the boot
cycling by a lot
okay try booting up -60 maybe it's been
having trouble at minus 30 and minus 40
so bring it down it might be like the
pace could have cracked or something by
now - which would mean that our CPU
could be running a lot hotter than the
there could be a big Delta between the
on to pot and the CPU what's the bet
there we go okay boot temp is minus 60
everyone remember that the boot
temperature is minus 60 that's what we
need to know okay before everything goes
wrong let's just accelerate it to go
Enron okay we're gonna stay at minus 68
for this your paste is Donsky I probably
I hate this error Joe is running into
that too okay all right well I don't
know I don't know 1.8 volts
yeah 1.8 is what they am the internal
extreme overclockers were running at to
do 5.2 on a 3900 X so it is a
possibility that that's what we need not
doing anything with memory just trying
to make sure it's not the problem
okay good temperature minus 60 is what
we want which is where we are nice okay
super chats well that's going well
hoping we make it MKT and the official
numbers up to four point oh I guess
Helen earlier I have front seat race in
$20 Thank You max rainy five guys after
your crazy schedule the past two weeks I
hope you have fun pushing the hardware
to the absolute limit PS the time on the
computer is wrong that is very likely it
is pretty fun to work on although we're
at the stage where it's getting annoying
because we're so close to what we want
here
and I just wanted to work and he said it
just works like Jensen says Benjamin
Hughes do you know how their new rise in
ships mainly the 3900 X Ron and the ACE
she's asked for seventy boards I have
the crosshair seven here oh they do run
we've run them in that board I don't
know I haven't looked at how well they
run I haven't looked at like the voltage
it tries to assign or anything sir
parsable 777 is there any reason to use
the AMD overclocking settings and horas
master UEFI standard controls seem to
work standard they aim the overclocking
settings yeah some of those do actually
overlap with standard no is my is my
answer to that question standard
settings work just fine there's a few
other options in there but as far as the
ones that overlap with the standard
options I don't think so I don't even
know like where let's make sure that CPU
is not running above ambient that would
be that would define the problem if so
this should read out a bugged number or
no temperature at all and it is no
temperature at all which means we should
be below and we should be below zero
okay kind of want it to be a little
colder for this but I don't want it to
crash so I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
minus 70 or so which is about where we
are right now okay on it before it dies
minus 70 Cinebench is gonna throw that
error and then we're gonna hit okay and
try again
so with the employ I'm just excited it's
in Windows right now our 15 - 71 please
almost there I'm gonna go to minus 75
now just kind of step it until it got
further step it up until it cold bugs
did more that time at minus 75 we have
the Cinebench issue man let's try minus
78 maybe I don't know if it's even if
it's a softer issue at this point okay
there we go seems to be about minus 80
where it gets unhappy so I don't know I
might have to call it pretty soon if
it's not gonna I can try to out push the
voltage a little higher I guess and then
we're gonna have actually have to call
it let me let me go over some of the
scores in a moment have you unlocked
anything else everything else on the
motherboard we've unlocked the settings
that are relevant here I haven't done
any other overclocking though
okay let's try that
so I said boot temperature minus 60 it
seemed to be a bit better this time
though let's try might be too cold for
booting but we can get it warmed up if
we have to blaming it on software is a
both idea again with circumstances what
do you mean what's have more Mille about
this Devils war gameplay by the ice
wanna upgrade my 77 okay doing the
visual basic Java Python unity playing
games I own 200 PC games little
streaming should I get 300 extra 900k
for that list I'm Mike from the 3900
acts
Brandon Smith just got parts like two
hours ago for a new risin 5 builds
success first boot nice up creating 4770
thanks for all the benchmark you guys
Rock well that's good to hear you have a
successful boot no need to rub it in
that's awesome that I got the r5 in
Daniel sterling 3900 axe MSI x4 somebody
gave me plus would I be able to OC Oh
some success clear master 244 : yes you
would be able to overclock with some
success for sure let's warm it up a bit
and then see if we can get it to go with
the new higher both it is
higher voltages that I put I think put
1.75 which is getting about to where we
are gonna have to stop how's the there's
not too much water in there which is
good so yeah just gonna keep trying this
until until either we have to give up
because it's clear no progress will be
made or until it works a 5.0 and then
we'll stop there
it's if we were stuck at like four point
seven or something it'd be a different
story and I just call it but stuck at
four point nine when I'm on five is too
close to want to give up okay duder
ninety-nine times thank you 48 486 DX 33
megahertz hey Steve just got the 3600
because of your review a nice upgrade
for my 1,600 X what do you mean from
your 16 aren't you running at 486 that's
a big upgrade from the 33 megahertz 486
TX Kyler stall it's $5 hey Steve I've
seen you out on the trails a couple
times you should do a gen cycling jersey
yes I would like to do that if we had
enough people who would want to buy one
but I think the minimum order quantity
is probably gonna be like a 100 plus
units on those so I don't know that
we'll sell that many pantheists $2 you
don't have to read the stupid questions
from super chat I just proved you wrong
brunch at her $4.99 what brand of
shampoo do you use
do you use conditioner q of the great
work we answered this ages ago it's a
throne paste typically cryo not
works really well we're at a higher
voltage now right so I guess it's a
different today is a new day than the
last boot I'm thinking the paste might
be done ski to you so let's do we don't
want - a teapot temp here that was where
we we're dying like instantly once we
hit that just bring it - I don't know -
72 75 for pretty close to the edge here
69 70 oh that's it is it gonna do it I
feel like I should look away okay all
right now this is the score of Halliday
said it's at 4.3 right now they reset
itself man that's so exciting
so disappointing DX - yeah boy someone
says hey let's push the voltage up some
more should I call
I wonder if Joe would answer right now
if Joe's a watching the stream where if
he's still slacking at the pool like you
said let's see
is he gonna answer hey I'm on stream
right now so don't say anything that'll
embarrass you
so what did what kind of voltages work
did you end up running for like the five
plus hardware ladies and I like - a
teapot temperature left everything stock
I'm just trying to do the frequency the
there's BDD one eight there's VDP
yeah I'm having I'm having a okay yeah
give it a shot
we're kind of at the end of how much I
want to try here so because it's been a
long strong we're very close to five
gigahertz but I'll try all those things
yeah yeah we'll do that next do that
after my next game I have a 12 core what
come up here in bench and we'll we'll do
a stream stream together with very quick
we get to systems running or something
that'd be fun yeah cool
sounds good well thank you Joe Joe this
is a just upon Zeon bearded hardware
everyone all right
see ya so Joe is the the mast he's been
working with my stuff for a couple days
now I think about a week maybe
so let's did it just I don't know okay I
got everything except for me core
let's wow really let's try his settings
just copy copy half of Joe okay I did
not know that so infinity fabric has a I
did I just hit V Gore got it thanks guys
that's funny
so I didn't know that infinity fabric
has the the cold issue but that's pretty
cool definitely check out bearded
hardware on YouTube he has joined us for
a few of these now and uh obviously no
it has more experience with this than I
do at this point so hopefully his
suggestions work he said he was having
issues booting below minus 15 which also
corresponds with what we've seen for us
it's minus 60 though but that's yes
we're good to go on V Gore okay good
let's see Keep Calm and raise V chord
yes that is that is what builds right
says alright so next questions where did
I stop Leviathan prim do you think we'll
see newer updated threader for CPUs
before the end of this year I don't know
I know they're coming out I don't know
when let's try it it's cycling I need to
might need to warm it up again like Joe
is saying minus 15 is where he was so
HCP is gonna be a bit different
Kyle need $2 what's CPU I can't read is
3900 X Thomas tonically changing RAM
from 3000 to 3600 results and how much
of a difference would it make
wouldn't it make with a 3900 X I haven't
tested that tack power up has it good in
their initial review they have a good
memory scaling look that would answer
that question so let's get it down
rather it's got it up to like -20 and
then once rat around there we can see if
CFS panel boot with Joe's recommended
settings and hopefully it was all the
Infinity fabric he was saying if it's
too high then you have issues running it
at the the cold temperatures okay it's
probably gonna need to go into by us
again because it just boot cycled since
it was stuck at that uh at low
temperature just heating it up get it to
boot into BIOS apply the profile I just
say so I'll be quick at least infinity
fabric and memory are the big changes
here ok now we're at minus sixteen so
it's about as warm as I want it to be if
this doesn't work and I think we're
gonna be done but I would like to see it
work there's a lot of water in there now
actually which is not great I think
that's water
hmm come on stop trying to attempt boots
so many times need an option to limit
the boots I clean there we go
okay BIOS reset no kidding
CPU is at 8 degrees burning ok
everything is still applied SSD is it
gonna work or what I guess I'll leave it
at that temperature for now API cars $1
Thank You Danny of an NAU and I sense a
qvd 1 dot Imani Mar I love him and keep
up the good work thank you we are trying
to make the work good tonight but after
the first half the stream we have been
countered issues
what CB is this by since see since site
3900 ax it's not liking it
we might need to get Joe up here if he
had cars again like you're pretty cruddy
gamer Jesus at work
Eddie car Niro 199 Michael brinly $2.00
where is snowflake our AMD correspondent
probably sleep in although I did put a
video of her on the GN steep side
channel just enough like attacking
inanimate objects was the OC and the
3900 extra view the OEM we never used
the stock heatsink ever with reviews we
always use a standardized heatsink it's
an X 62 at max speeds which has
demonstrating the first half of the
stream where we saw scaling in frequency
stock zero changes at all of up to 200
plus megahertz that's why we use one
heatsink for it because otherwise it's
not a not a like-for-like yeah so not
like in those settings I guess will
lower some of it and see if just the
Infinity fabric change does what we need
mmm Seth Tainan I saw a video
description that says pod mats were not
of quality I don't see that as being
true well Paul's video was satire which
I think should have been pretty obvious
but thank you for saying that you don't
see those being true he does not either
it was a satire video
Big Al 2 is 68th love the L&amp;amp;T content
just wondering hardware in for a harder
monitor or cam definitely not cam as my
recommendation hardware monitor is not
great hardware and faux is my favorite
it works very well ok well let's clear
clear that and lower some stuff you can
do this don't stop go go go
okay
just trying to read the normal chat - it
takes a lot to fry this fish yes it
certainly does yes the question
someone's asking where where are we
frequency let me do a recap of all that
stuff you missed it so four point nine
is where we were booting I might need to
break the system down I think it's
probably it might be getting a water
logged or something four point nine is
where we were we were successful let's
go through Cinebench runs with the
overclocks so stock like for like here
so low temperatures for everything stock
we were at nice 33:19 Cinebench score
and then four point three all core 3377
four point five all core 3522 this r15
for when six all core thirty six oh
eight four point nine thirty eight
thirty two that's where it stopped being
successful our twenty we ran at four
point seven was eighty three eighty
points and our twenty we ran four point
seven at 5:49 single for frequency
scaling i'm gonna give like three
numbers here at 78 degrees celsius CPU
temperature we were seeing a forty fifty
megahertz frequency you dropped that to
55 we saw a forty two hundred megahertz
42:25 frequency you dropped that to 18
degrees Celsius on the cpu is forty to
fifty to forty three hundred with Jeff's
precision because not overdrive just
precision boost to overdrive is a
different thing so I was just the CPU
doing what it wanted to do which was the
really interesting part of the beginning
that we looked at
don't know I'm kind of out of ideas I
think everything is what it should be
infinity fabric should be turned down
yeah okay
okay well try booting again hmm there's
a bunch of water running down the
outside of the pot last time he torched
it looked like it was soaking through
the shop towels yeah it's possible
there's a bunch of Vaseline and eraser
on the board so hopefully it's fine but
it is possible that it's uh that it's
got issues with water at this point okay
super chats Mitchell Morgan Thank You P
ow one dollar
yeah again one dollar Andrew marring the
lid yes we got it thank you
Ellie zn5 guys like you Billy Mizrahi
$1.00 here now so with a knife I look
forward to meeting you at LTX 2019 yes
we will be there l easy and will there
be a 38 hundred extra view yes I'm going
to read a lot of these as fast as I can
right now while this thing fails to do
it and then what maybe I'll just reset
it at like 49 and do one finishing score
just so we have a number to finalize
with let's do that
freezing Tad's $2 3600 OSE or 3700 x4
gaming can you overclock the 3600 to the
X Oh
we're gonna publish a review right after
this video ends will answer that
question yes you can of course and the
30 if you're just gaming we think the
3600 is a very good option for that and
if you're doing anything that would
actually use the extra threads then
3,700 X might be good for you but it was
just gaming we're liking the 3600 save a
lot of money that way you can spend more
on the video card instead Zack bowling
$10 show us your cameraman who works for
you you do behind the scenes of Linus
but show us your behind the scenes what
Oh but show us your behind the scenes we
have behind the scenes videos and a on
the patreon uploads if Andrew wants to
come on camera he can but he doesn't
want to but we do have we have somebody
on the scenes videos up and we did the
office moving vlog for awhile you could
go watch that series and see everybody
pickle click 1999 I've been drinking
scotch so what the hell here's some
money for your content
hashtag captain overclock thank you and
we just called Joe's or how fitting
Casey a home for one dollar Kyle
Engstrom what's the smallest processor
that can be used to make process what's
the smallest process like me just to
make processors 5 nanometers question
mark don't know I mean yeah I'm sure
we'll get there but I have no idea
here's what we're gonna do I'm not gonna
pretend to know either we're gonna we're
gonna go back to where it was working
that's not where it was working I would
be very sad stock settings and all I'm
going to do is get like a final run in
there everything's been cleared at this
point so we're good there
point four would get great timing leave
the rest alone
and I think we were at like I don't
remember where we at one point six eight
maybe I wrote it down actually I have it
written down that I was hitting five
point one point six five yesterday so
it's probably a better mount which sucks
but a four point nine at one point five
volts is what I was doing so let's do
one point five five and then these can
all be left alone all right three five
okay will this thing still work with
settings that were previously successful
if not then we know there's a problem
with the system needing to be broken
down if it's been running too long
Patrick Wilson Hey Dude thanks for all
your videos of the channel happy to
finally catch one of your live streams
from Down Under
yes I don't know what time it is where
you are right now but I'm assuming
that's nearly the opposite time
Jason Overmyer two dollars thank you for
all your amazing rise in 3000 content
there's much more coming out we're
publishing another one after this stream
ends which may be never at the current
pace data keep it 10 - hush playing Sims
6 on my 3900 ex while watching what do
you think about Andy discontinuing
Radeon seven six months after its intro
I think that you talk about buyer's
remorse the super look at the Radeon 7
because the hundred XT is like matching
it and gaming and and it's cheaper so
its main benefit at this point is going
to be the memory which we show is
actually useful and some of those
production applications we published a
workstation benchmarks video I think
it's I think the system is done let me
try to answer these while I break the
system down I guess and we'll just see
if there's a bunch of water in the
socket maybe but 4.9 is the answer for
that I don't know if I feel like it we
might rebuild it but I did we now we
can't do that way it's the other work we
do another video so let me torch this
and start breaking that down and I'll
answer some of the super chats
we've got how many other to go through
where where's that we ever get him out
to go through okay that's not too bad
it's achievable so idea bunch of super
chats for a while the store purchases
I'll shout one of those out right now
Thomas from Washington there's a lot of
Washington purchases today picked up the
tear down toolkit as well thank you okay
well let's get started on breaking it
down and seeing if it's full of water so
we can start with these question from
Tiki 832 would love to see a video on
how these CPUs handle very large long
history dwarf fortress world generation
I don't know how to test that that's a
that's that's the first challenge is I
wouldn't know where to begin with
benchmarking with Dwarf Fortress but if
someone wants like email me at go ahead
I mean if it's relatively easy like
install it and click go and I can try it
Vitor says riah
are you are you sure that isn't a sub
honey I see quite sure seems to cold
everything's frozen to it it is not a 39
ad XE
next question mr. Lima Bean mom look
this brick is running at 5 gigahertz
yeah well as a brick it was running at 5
there's only have 4.9 successfully
though any plans to do a vid about
Radeon image sharpening and Radeon
anti-lag features curious if it's just
marketing vs we did start looking at
Radeon image sharpening and it does
actually do something whether or not
it's worth it will depend an awful lot
on how you perceive quality I guess
Travis Mobley 99sec here reborn $10 will
your memory scaling video go passport a
megahertz up to maybe 4.5 or 5 all
videos I watched don't go past 38 100
interesting to see if high memory will
push 3900 X past Intel for gaming I'm
not sure yet it depends on on on where
it gets stuck so yeah that'll depend on
how far we can get our memory kits we
have here I know we have kids I can do
4,000 so we can probably do 4,000 I
don't know if we have kids that will do
much beyond 4,000 here's why I think by
the way we're having some issues because
I don't have a mount for this everyone
should go tell their Barrow to send me a
proper mount so what I did was zip tie
it to the board on that side and then
screw it into the board on this side but
we're gonna see the I mean there's an
awful lot of water on here we'll see if
there's this probably water on the
motherboard which would be the reason
why we can't even boot at four point
nine anymore which sucks because I had
at 5.0 yesterday for one run and then I
was like okay it works shutdown but I
guess that means we can do another
stream the pot does have a lot of water
in it though actually which means it's
not even cool and effectively so
standard issues when you run for that
lon
see
Zen camp zenovation Thank You Travis
Mowgli Thank You Ronny Tuckerman five
dollars like you Alex Yolo swagger two
dollars advice for good airflow
case to get with a Kraken next 72 age
500 mesh is good what else was good the
second for the 360 the new Silverstone
cases look pretty good this is gonna
take a look this screw takes forever
Kevin Davis Thank You Zack bowling $5.00
a squirrel is constantly trying to steal
bird seed from feeders do you recommend
I yeah and I update my 1920 X 29 50x now
or wait for a news NT to TR I don't
understand
[Laughter]
2950 X if it's on a good sale I don't
know how long until Zen to thread refer
when will when will you be putting out a
new coheed and cambria help them keep
the good work thank you same time cool
puts out a new album player won $10 asks
did you see that level one text did you
see that level one texts got the 3900
x-2 4.5 by disabling pblpblpblpbl is not
stock it should be disabled by default
precision boost might be the one you're
thinking of PB o is not precision boost
they're distinctly different things
anyway the question by disabling
precision boost I would assume because
PBS should be off so they shouldn't have
to disable that I don't know all the
newfangled AMD technology the kids are
using would this be something to look
into further
yes so a lot of people this is not the
users fault like and these naming on
this is really not good
auto sees another one that is not a
great name but yes the answer is yes is
worth looking into further we actually
have a video that's done I need to
finish the back half of the script read
after we're off stream here and then
that'll be alive so you can watch it
let's see let me publish that other
video to you we've got that a 3600 X
review I can set that live right now
there's so much water in this thing
I mean out of the classic and the CPU
stuck to the cooler issue one sec I want
to publish that
okay so 3,600 extra fees going up I'm
gonna keep reading the rest of these
super chats for those of you who want to
hear your super chat read I am going to
get to it if you don't post any more I'm
gonna cut it off here at 9:45 Eastern
Time assuming that time is correct
whatever the clock says on my computer
basically there's a new video but I'm
gonna keep reading super chats go ahead
and open that and pause it or something
if you want to see it that's the 3600 x
review &amp;amp; versus the 3600 okay back to
the questions did you dame fled Farrukh
did you ever freeze it ruin your
glorious hair no I do not freeze it our
one live trade you my GTX 960 two
gigabyte with coil watch for a 4
gigabyte V what is it what is that
Radeon Omega maybe I don't know it's a
fork
KC ha for five guys they chanced the
recent Intel 10th gen leaks hold water
they are fake that is the truth we
confirmed that it's gonna be in our next
Newsbreak SAR fake I'm just trying to to
break the pace right now next one then
and by leaks I mean someone made that
slide like not a dental Nathan already
appreciate the content you should do a
video with Ian Contras on the next event
dude is abuse so David Cantor will
totally understand yes ian is another
very knowledgeable individual in the
space so that is certainly in the in the
realm of possibility if I know I've
spoken with him at the events check out
that water you ready
there's a lot of the problem you get
that much water is enough to cover the
whole base of the lm-2 pot so we're
having issues with even just conducting
at this point it's been running too long
rotting Toulon is the problem
yeah well that's not an issue anymore I
guess
okay next question
vortex what a custom loop be worth it
Verizon 3000 or would it not make enough
of a difference to clock over an AI oh
hey I was gonna be close they're gonna
be pretty similar here's by the way a
bunch of water in the socket area anyway
on the eraser so and there's water so I
mean the motherboards alive and
everything it's just that once this
starts happening stuff acts funny and
what we're gonna need to do is let it
dry out probably overnight and then come
back to this and just start at 5:00 for
the next one we're gonna have two CPUs
got water on it too so everything still
works it's just that it's um it's
waterlogged so we'll let it dry out and
then do another one at 5:00 sometime
start at 5 gigahertz and then hopefully
that will work straightaway but we have
found the source of the issue we were
having we're stopped booting eventually
let me get an another question before I
do this what NZ one day thank you 10
Crusader 2 dollars you're the man they
saw some videos thank you for watching
and for supporting Kevin Davis $5 is how
long did it take you to grow your hair
out are you worried - Ellen to get into
it
no on number 2 and I don't remember
about a while extension and nygma Steve
greater than J thank you T I'll be on
stream with J I'm Tuesday by the way BBJ
is hosting us for a battle tank grantee
thanks man
Thank You Zachary Ramsey ten dollars or
one dollar that gear and penalty air one
$5.00 keep doing what you do by the way
I love your mountain bike fit here's
also thank you there's on the GN Steve
Channel Corey Schroeder
$10 signing anything this streamed now
we were not I've got my poster and mouse
mat that's awesome it's in for some more
also 1.68 volts quote I reject your
reality and substitute my own
that's one of my favorite quotes from
Savage yeah 1.68 was certainly getting
there but obviously Joe is running even
higher than that this stuff's pretty
awesome by the way
it's just contact cleaner blast out the
socket to get that paste out of there
will bow five dollars will you do it a
case awards show and a CPU roundup this
year yet cool around up yes you
recommend any air coolers or cases
budget off the top of your head the 270
yards probably really cheap now the case
it's fine the are l06 is good the put is
that one and are for no and our 600 from
Coolermaster that's pretty affordable to
as an airflow case while Don's what is
the best x 570 board in the 360 to $400
price range build toy's got a video on
exactly that on our channel you should
check it out Tony $2.00 take my free
money Thank You Douglas watch CPU is it
was the 3900 ax it's still working but
it needs to need to break at a mage or
damage I guess if you take the space out
I have to 1080 T is an SLI 208 for the
next gen or upgrade now I'd wait those
are pretty hard to beat also a second
supergiant from that prison also love
you guys kid with a great work thank you
Anton 379 rubles I think best wishes
from Russia what do you think of the
threader for 3 processors is it possible
to expect 64 cores I have no current
expectations because that's the best way
to be disappointed not sure but I can
tell you that I've got a cameo in pro
high tech which is the Russian YouTube
channel that covers tech I have a cameo
and they're coming up regarding shadow
of the Tomb Raider pronunciation Logan
Van Dusen $10 how long would you
recommend waiting to purchase the new
gen GPUs do you need a card now yes or
now if it's no then just wait yen's did
most 2:22 awesome stream still on the
tour the 1600 309 gigahertz 1.55 volts
that's pretty good hard to beat that
I've got a lot more to read here but
we're gonna go through all them fabian
Reich
stop using advanced meme devices well if
memes are like being very competitive at
the price then I guess that's what they
are and your roof car does the 3800 xoc
better than the 3700 X I would assume on
average they're about the same
all of these CDs are about the same
might be bend a little better but
doesn't matter at that point I don't
know you're fighting over 50 megahertz
maybe Patrick J nothing but love for
your channel all the hard work you put
in to make sure nerds are well informed
thanks for the content well thank you
for watching but didn't get X title says
5 gigahertz on beyond so you can't stop
until you exceed 5 gigahertz well we did
when we did the pre testing Joe might
have to come up here for for a follow-up
the SI boy $50 thank you at what
temperature does Intel and AMD cold bug
have you tested cryogenic grease grease
paste as paste under Ellen - it
shouldn't crack I have not actually
interesting interesting option what
temperature it was - 85 for this one and
Intel's all over the place but it can be
anywhere from minus 110 minus 160 dead
joke 666 night I heard kr 3900 acts for
gaming and streaming but with her fine
simultaneously you'll get if you want to
if you're ok streaming at a completely
acceptable h.264 encoding rate of like
faster or something 10 megabits maybe 6
megabits doesn't matter you can get a
higher in-game FPS on ion RK and still
sustain the stream if you want for some
reason a different h.264 encoding
quality then you go 3,900 X Michael
Vernon $2 go go get that 5.1 nope
agreement my dude I wonder will we get
that fabled 7.7 gigahertz
on the FX series processors you could do
that creepy oh yeah hi Steve I'm fan of
your content ever since
keep up the amazing work greetings from
Austria anyway what all core OC would
you expect on an MSI be 350 gaming Pro
with stock coin with modern with the new
CPUs not super high
with stock cooling I may be 3.9 on a
platform like you know of one thousand
three is 3.9 4.0 on the first gen maybe
that it depends on how many cores you've
got gets hot justin hasting do you know
the power draw at these clocks at all no
but we can check next time
Jody $5 would you still recommend the
throne paste patterns you did Verizon
2000s 3000 yeah it's just make sure the
whole IHS is covered your kid Brennen
flag $2 really regarding the time when I
picked up the torch and said we use this
because it's too hot so it's definitely
too hot Astro definitely hot astral
storm how far can you go with a solid
with solid co2 like dry ice don't know
you can get it to - if you ever see it
where a doctor eye stops - like - 70ish
or something plus or minus 10 degrees oh
you - 80 South repay yeah we should have
done that if we wanted it but it's a
it's too waterlogged needs to dry off
thoroughly if I had Joe here to go run
it to the hand dryer in the bathroom we
could do that his cane been a Ellen's he
had Stefan Z carrying and fear at
Computex as he ordered him around arms
crossed with the stern look on his face
they've known each other a long time
they're friends that's just how they
overclocked together bazinga axe
snowflake would be at 6.00 by now
probably true how many more do we have
here I just want to make sure we get
through these yes we are not too far
nice all right I've got like two pages
of scrolling left what causes the cold
bug minor voltage to low I'm not sure I
guess it's the overclockers who actually
know what they're doing I've told me at
various platform to platform I know you
can change the boot up voltage should be
different from the sustain voltage on
some platforms and that helps but I
think it's to do with the CPUs I'm not
sure Jonathan Davis buy a pizza on me I
am starving so we will do that Thank You
Konza I'm an Aussie going to LTX will
you bring merch can i order some and
pick it up from you there I might bring
a couple
toolkits with me but we're not bringing
I mean it's whatever we can fit in the
checked bag but certainly you could you
could buy something there if I have it
it's probably gonna be toolkits I'm also
given minuses team a lot of mod mats to
use for their tables I think we're
giving them a six plus whatever they
already have and then I think we're
gonna give those away once the show is
over
five dollars need to upgrade ln3 yes we
do
Adam Schumann senior in your expert
opinion
well hey 3900 X run okay and across hair
six hero I'm actually not sure X 370 I'm
a little fuzzy on across her seven hero
no problem cross her six hero I am not
positive how like how the BIOS behaves
I'd be more of a BIOS concern for me
Kyle Dunbar
you look tired here's $10 towards a trip
to comes red bikes in the legendary
trails of east Kootenai is at British
Columbia you can do it well I'll be up
there in a Whistler after LTX
Andre de les G $1 a DK dollars Tim Wolfe
word $5 says applause for the 4.9
gigahertz that was a long time ago
super ahsoka any plans to review the
3200 g34 energy yes I'll buy your
favorite pizza that's my final offer
the answer is yes we are reviewing them
unbox me burn the score we're getting
close to the end of these Hyundai itis
Butler $5 what's the oldest board you
have used for a build and overclocked I
have an MSI at 955 X Platte and I've
never been used
the one I overclocked plan to Halen is
where I really started doing that X 58
to say X 58 deluxe I think Josh Ricker
some be 450 boards have PCIe for tough
be 450 well if they're not using the
newest of G's or Andy toggled it off or
if they dug up the binary and figured
out you could enable PCI you for on any
of the boards whether it works well or
not it's different but that's cool
though J Daniel $5
hey-oh one note on that too you need to
use rise in 3000 actually make use of it
give us know if like some love for me I
have a 3600 X
4.3 Alcor 1.45 volts is that good 1.45
is kind of high I would not use that
long term definitely get that lower if
you can like 1.4 below and maybe lower
than that but 1.4 for sure co king kun
$2 any news on the ACS impact or Strix
ITX release no I have no idea when
they're coming out
Nick G 440 recommend watt power supply
for 3900 accent overclocked to 1080
should be fine on like 600 650 650 maybe
be safe Jared Melton $2.00 check your
damn mount yes it was bad
Matthew McCullough no message
Tiki 8:32 just bought a 37 X upgrade my
2700 X which is four point one five I
think the 40 TVP drop will help push the
3700 X more oh yeah you'll probably be
able to go higher just because the CP is
a bit easier to work with - are you
going to test games the priority at one
ccac's 1300 X maybe we have a lot of
other stuff in the pipe we could we do
have I want to do Alan to gaming at 4.9
I guess or 5.0 if we can get it the dang
stone memory V quarters at Otto we've
got that chaos 7 3 what's the F o'clock
limit you've hit hoping for 2000 we
stopped at 1866 when we played around
with it but haven't done more phobia is
it worth upgrading that 59 30 K it is n
2 that's getting lawn of the tooth so
probably my all it depends it depends on
what you're doing but you have to look
into production versus gaming stuff
Michael March can I run out a 2080
Seahawk with 2600 CP or should I upgrade
ye you should be fine
2080 TIR definite gonna bottleneck 2080
you'll be close to it but
serpent access F glad to see you and
your team got rest finally not yet
we're almost there one more page left
Nick Mosley planning to do a full 300 X
build what Ram speed and bran do you
think is best
is it worth waiting for that come in G
g.skill neo kits I have one coming out
I don't know but the g.skill tried and
see we've had good luck with the 32
hundred megahertz seems like a good like
affordable middle ground 36 hundreds
fine but I like the Trident II kits I'm
sure there's other stuff but we haven't
gotten the NiO and yet Patrick Wilson
Thank You Patrick Wilson I quote I have
to be matter of fact the mat is not flat
that's all there is to say about that
quote from Paul maybe Jake Rosenthal $5
greetings from Washington State
currently waiting for my 39 Ardex yeah
that'll be a nice system when you get it
in since I can you get Linus to T pose
at LTX we might be able to trick Linus
into doing that Mitch Peterson most
cost-effective CPU for handbrake
transcoding 37 Ardex question mark
probably once you start getting too many
threads you need to split it into two
processes so that would keep it the
easiest ransie Tamblyn $5 love you buddy
Thank You Allie Robertson campaign
contribution Tech Jesus for president no
the first counter campaign ad will be
can't even get it to 5 gigahertz even
though it was working yesterday but
close enough 4.2 hind robot tech TV do
you think 136 we have like eight more of
these I think the 3600 is enough for
streaming on Twitch without framedrops
only one pc no capture card if the game
isn't too CPU intensive yes you can make
it work maybe like very fast or
something and then 6 megabits per second
I think it's it's workable you can do
some priority or affinity tuning if you
need to Sean Newby please don't read
this thank you ok thank you that was
actually where I did cut it off there's
only a couple more there so I'll go
ahead and just hit those kavik any
waterblock manufacturers making custom
blocks for water verizon 3000 series off
of senator heat source yes but I don't
know when they're gonna be out EK i
think is working on stuff martin deliora
I want only Thank You Aaron Hass I
appreciate your interaction with the
viewers thank you well it went on a long
time for these but I fell behind so
sorry about that
Neal Gorge Baker 56 price is really low
is it a good option if it's really
really low like below fifty seven
hundred and
I don't know like that yeah it's it's
still a reasonably good option our Smith
keels a great coverage thank you it's
gonna be it thoughts on using thirty six
hundred X on a lower actually seventy
board should be fine as long as the BIOS
is going to work with it and the VRM
isn't terrible okay that's that's that's
it that's that's how of it so thank you
for watching
thanks for hanging out while we did all
this I don't think I'm gonna like we
could try and mmm how wet is the board
it's still frozen underneath I don't
know I don't know if I want to rebuild
this and try for five because I think it
probably needs to be blown out
completely so yeah now we're gonna stop
tez pushing right now and it's this wet
is a good way to kill the processor and
nothing's dead right now so we're gonna
stop there alright so yes we've read all
the super chats that's gonna be it
five is doable for sure it's just I'm
gonna have to start at five next time
for point 9s where we ended we got some
really cool data on precision boost to
scale beginning of the stream we will
recap that for you in a separate video
and we got to finish our other video
that Patrick was working on now so
thanks for watching and subscribe for
more we'll be working on more rising
content in the immediate future and then
we're gonna have a brief break while we
go to overclock vs Jay at EVGA
headquarters so that'll be pretty fun
too
