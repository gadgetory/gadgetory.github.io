dotnet and I am NOT yelling for once
which is kind of strange you're probably
used to hearing my voice being very
scratchy and annoying but we are in a
quieter area with Chris Roberts from
star citizen and he is he's got some
great updates for us on star citizen's
development of course which we spoke
about originally not too long ago on the
technical side today we're talking more
about gameplay and overall progression
Chris can you tell us a little bit about
progress so far with star citizen okay
well so we have essentially stepped up
our austin studio and our Los Angeles
office is going to be finished in the
first of aid like the first week of
April so we'll be in there in the second
week of April onwards and we're busily
working away so we're actually upgrading
to a new version of the CryEngine which
is they've there's a whole new update
that has all the features of Crysis 3
and then some new stuff that we're
working on so we've been doing that and
getting our asset pipeline going so it's
a lot of getting people on board getting
them up to speed getting them familiar
with the engine we've got some people
that are actually joined us from Crytek
and so they obviously know the the
engine and been training some of their
other people and but we're like I feel
like the team's really gelling and it's
it's feeling good so we're gonna have
some cool stuff to be showing in the
coming months sounds very promising have
you had to me any compromises so far on
your original vision have there been any
technical or design challenges you've
faced no we haven't actually compromised
anything I would say in a few cases we
may have even expanded on what we were
originally thinking so it's still early
day so maybe later on down the line
we'll have to pull back a bit but right
now it's actually I think gonna be even
cooler than what I was originally
thinking when I was pitching it I'm not
sure how possible that is but I will
happily look forward to it
PvP can we talk about player account of
players in PvP and will there be any
major incentives for players to stage
larger battles do you have any idea on
that stuff yet well okay so they'll
definitely be incentives to have some
bigger battles so in terms the amount of
players in one any one sort of battle
so in our instance we're calling it we
don't quite know kind of what the limit
of the count is part of the reason we're
going to do the dogfighting alpha at the
end of this year that's you know and
this is just to allow you to fly and
dogfight in the in the ships that you've
pledged for it won't have a persistent
universe it won't have the story but
it's for us to sort of do balancing on
the ships and the weapons and also to
see how many ships we can get in one
area and have that be fun and have you
know the feedback and the performance
work really well so we're not quite sure
yet so we're hoping to get closer to a
hundred if we can but you know it could
be as low as 40 or 50 or it could be as
high as 200 we don't know that's part of
the reason to run the test which we'll
do at the very end of of this year but
there are important things to make it as
cool a fun as possible as far as things
to do with other people I mean we have
elements areas in the persistent
universe that will be persistent in
space that you can fight over so for
instance like maybe there's an asteroid
base inside an asteroid field and that's
a really good hideout for like a pirate
and it's right near the merchants
trading run so that will be a place that
like a pirate gang would one a hole to
take over so another parrot gang may
want to come and take it from them or
even the merchant Gill could hire the
mercenary Gill to go and clean out the
nest of pirates so they'll be fed
there'll be areas or things around space
that will you'll be able to fight over
for sort of territory so to speak and
the big capital ships are a little like
that they just can move instead of being
static like an asteroid base sure sounds
sounds very crazy for PvP I'm kind of
looking forward to it what about latency
issues with players in you know
Australia versus Americans or Europeans
can you tell us a little bit about how
you're handling that well so that's part
of the sort of online in the backend
system we're in the middle of building
and designing right now so my goal is to
try and and take care of everyone around
so you know as we're sort of leaning
towards a cloud solution for the sort of
last server part of the equation which
is the battle instant stuff so in
that and that in that case that if we
can do the cloud solution and get it to
have performance that works really well
that will allow us to be able to deploy
servers throughout the world pretty
easily scale up and down depending on
demand so you know that would be a
server in Australia or you know east
west coast of America or maybe a couple
in Europe and so that's that's that's
the goal so a combination of sort of
cloud deployed and some dedicated but we
haven't fully gone through that so you
know that may not be the case in the
final day but my my goal is to try and
have everyone that's around the star
citizen universe no matter where you are
in geography get a good a good
experience so you don't want to have a
lot of latency or lag awesome great one
of the more random sounding questions is
from a guy on reddit I think he's a mod
actually of the star citizen subreddit
and he wanted to know if your sound will
be dynamic and how you're handling sound
with respect specifically to the the
damage of the ship will they be able to
hear the damage through sounds in the
game stuff like that no it's definitely
so you'll be able to hear damage on part
so the parts that move will sound one
way and then if they're damaged they'll
sound different and so you know you
should be able to hear creaking and
stuff when your ship gets more damaged
and the sounds themselves are set up in
a way that they can be dynamic in 3d if
you've got you know surround speakers
and stuff like that we actually position
everything in 3d when we're playing the
sounds it's part of the sound system
that runs already inside CryEngine cool
any anything you really want to put out
to your fans your backers that you know
you want to say to them and really get
them hyped more about star citizen if
that's possible well first of all I'll
say thank you to everyone because it's a
you know amazing that we're managing to
make the game and with the level of
ambition and the level of backing
because it's you know we're not making
something small or making something
pretty big so thank you very much for
for backing what we're doing and it's
amazing we have a brilliant community
and I'll just say that you know this
even though the games two years away
we're building and doing things so
everyone can interact
this year and next year so you know the
hanger module is going to come out in
August which will allow you to check the
ships out you've pledged and look around
it and maybe have your friends come and
check your ships out and we're going to
try and get some of the customization
options available for it I don't know if
I'll have it right at the very beginning
but definitely towards the end and then
you're the dogfighting we'll be in in
December so it's it's going to be a fun
ride and you know check the the website
that we run Roberts space industries
comm for updates and and thank you all
there you go excellent thank you Chris
for that for your time and good luck on
your panel today check out our coverage
of the panel online after PAX East and
that's it for the show this is our last
interview so I will see you guys next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
