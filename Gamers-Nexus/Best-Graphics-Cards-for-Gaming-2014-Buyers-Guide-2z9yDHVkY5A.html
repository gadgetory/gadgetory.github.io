nexus donna and today we're looking at
video cards once again that is a thing
that we do a lot so this time it's a
it's a buyer's guide from the bottom to
the top of the best video cards out
there for gaming and i'm specifically
looking at the ninety dollar price range
at the very very low end entry-level
htpc level all the way up to 600 bucks
for the flagship cards that are out
there by Nvidia and AMD and this buyers
guide really should be used as a tool
especially for the holiday season but it
it will extend into 2015 for relevance
because we don't have new cards yet so
this is still relevant until those new
cards start shipping the guide starts
with the radeon r7 260x which is
presently available for about $95 that
is a steal for the card that it is you
it looks similar to this this is a 250 x
and it will be able to push about low to
medium settings depending on the game at
1080p now this is a card that's going to
be lower TDP than other AMD devices but
still higher than nvidia is most
immediate competitors it's not going to
produce the amount of heat though that
AMD is known for with its 290x for
example so it's not like it's crazy hot
but it does require more power than what
nvidia would require the 260x will play
games very well at low settings should
play most games that are not triple a
massive graphics demos at medium you
will not be playing Assassin's Creed
unity or far cry 4 or watch dogs on this
260x you can play battlefield 4 on low
settings but that's really sort of the
extent of the higher fidelity graphics
games that you'll be playing with a 260x
it is mostly meant for ultra budget pcs
stuff that's going to plain Lowell Wow
Star Wars you name it stuff like that
Skyrim grid games like that it will play
very well as an alternative to the 260x
there is the 750 this is a passive 750
which is priced at around a hun
2 120 dollars it does get a bit steeper
if it's passive and this is really
something you would want to buy if you
have a very specific use case scenario
for instance if you're building a home
theater PC that needs to eliminate
cables wherever possible this does not
require any power cables it can run
completely off pcie power and it's also
useful if you want to eliminate fan
noise it will perform slightly lower
than the 260x I would recommend the 260x
if you're strictly gaming on a very
tight budget and recommend this if you
have specific htpc needs moving up to
next price range we've got the budget
price range as we call it on gamers
Nexus and that includes the Radeon r9
270 and the gtx 750ti and those two
cards look something like this the r9
270 is a very high-performing card for
the price it originally shipped closer
to two hundred dollars but it's now a
bit I was it was about one hundred
eighty dollars 270x was about two
hundred dollars both cards respectively
are now about 150 and 160 so big price
drop the gtx 750ti is presently
available for about one hundred thirty
dollars so you're basically looking at
the sub 150 range you're looking at the
r9 270 for 147 and the gtx 750ti for 130
both are very good the 750 ti obviously
has differences in software more active
driver updates although AMD is changing
that very soon and it's got Nvidia's GFE
and shadowplay which may be useful to
you that said Andy has gbr which does
similar things and they have drivers
updating very soon that will update
their software quite a bit ultimately
what you're looking at is TDP and price
if you don't care too much about the
extra power requirement you don't care
about the power cable required the six
pen for a 270 then grab the 270 for 147
dollars if you can afford it because
that is a crazy good budget gaming card
and most systems at 1080 will be playing
justifying medium to high ish setting
depending on the game obviously your
anti-aliasing all that stuff makes a
huge impact on the performance but for
the most part you'll be playing games
like titanfall on high games like even
Far Cry will play fairly well once the
stuttering is resolved by Ubisoft and
grid easily hi ultra and so forth the
gtx 750ti performs very well also it'll
play battlefield 4 in my testing at high
settings pretty darn well about 40 FPS
depending on your cpu and other
components and that is very competitive
with the 270 but the 270 hands down is a
better performer strictly in terms of
FPS this requires less power at 65 watts
does not require a power connector at
all and can can be put into a smaller
box and it's just cheaper it's seventeen
dollars cheaper so if you can't afford
the jump from one 30-ish to 150 it's
just grab a 750 Ti you'll probably be
happy check the benchmarks on our
website first to make sure it's going to
play what you want to play but for the
most part it's a good card all right now
we're getting into the mid-range cards
these are the fun ones the mid-range
price point has suddenly become more
relevant strictly because for gigabyte
the ram cards are now seeing heavy using
games specifically made by Ubisoft but I
expect that trend will continue with the
other triple-a makers very shortly and
my testing far cry 4 and Assassin's
Creed unity both use upwards of four gig
of ram if you make it available that is
not to say it's necessary that 4
gigabytes it will just consume that much
memory from the video card if it is
present so it's probably a good idea to
start prepping and moving in the
direction of higher capacity video cards
for that reason we recommend the r9 280x
as our primary go to card for the 150
ish to 250 ish price point and that's
just because it's a very high performer
it beats out the gtx 770 and quite a few
games frame per frame and the 770 pulls
ahead a little bit in some games like
Battlefield 4 but that's about it for
the most part they're either equal or
the 280x out
forms it a good a bit and it's also
priced at two hundred dollars so the
280x comes with three gigabytes of video
ram this is a gtx 770 currently priced
at about two hundred fifty dollars for
two gigabytes of video ram performs very
well if you're doing things that are
kuta based or compute based if you are a
hobbyist youtube video editor or
streamer and you use render and editing
software that will make use of kuta
you'll probably want this instead of the
280x gaming performance will be slightly
lower but your production performance
will be way higher than what AMD can
currently provide for sony and adobe
software the gtx 770 is still a very
good card but at two hundred fifty
dollars it's pretty tough to beat the
two-hundred-dollar 280 x which really
does outperform it in raw power then
there's the gtx 760 if you can't afford
either of those I've seen gtx 760 s 4
190 dollars lately depending on the sale
and where you go and that is really a
pretty crazy deal considering the card
was originally a mid-range ER in the 250
plus range when it launched so that's a
very good bye if you can't afford the
extra for 280 x or a 770 at this one two
hundred fifty dollars next we've got
high-end cards this would include the
new gtx 970 very powerful low TDP low
thermals and great engineering design on
the maxwell architecture and the
reference cooler and AMD's r9 290x this
one is much hotter it runs a very high
wattage you can check all the specs on
the website and the link of the
description below but it pushes pretty
high performance so it does make up for
it a bit but in the article i say our
go-to is the gtx 970 this is the price
point where nvidia sort of takes the the
market by storm for gaming because the
value for TDP for thermals that you're
cramming these bigger cards into cases
it's time to start being concerned about
thermals and for the performance of the
970 is very good it's really pretty
unbeatable at 305
50 ish three seventy dollars for the
four gigabytes vram version the 290x is
three hundred dollars now which is crazy
cheap AMD is definitely trying to fight
back so it is very tempting to get one
of these at that seventy dollar cheaper
price point but honestly I would push
you toward the 970 because
engineering-wise is a far more sound
device for the thermals the cooling and
the software and drivers Andy does very
well in the previous price ranges as
you've noticed in this video but really
the 970 will play everything at Ultra
I've tested it it plays ultra very well
for pretty much all games right now
plays a CU l far cry 4 well can even
play watchdogs which is saying something
because websites is not optimized and
you'll be happy with that card now if
you're exceeding 1080p if you're
exceeding single monitor use then it's
time to consider something like the GTX
mining or an SLI set up and the GTX 980
is something we benchmarked and it's the
best video card I've ever tested on the
bench for gaming in this price point is
available at five hundred and fifty
dollars plays everything that max pretty
much no problem at 1080p and we'll play
some games with DSR scaling to 1440 or
4k fairly well depending on what game it
is and how intensive it is originally
you will struggle with 4k gaming that's
really not feasible yet on a single GPU
you definitely need either a hive ram
AMD solution for that or an SLI setup or
something of that nature if you want 4k
gaming that's really not the focus of
this article but I would say that the
980 is the best flagship buy right now
at the 550 dollar price point do note
that is it's about a ten percent
improvement over the 970 so the gains
are small and the price jump is big it's
two hundred dollars more so again top to
bottom GTX 980 is our flagship
recommendation the GTX 970 is our go-to
high-end recommendation with the 290x
trailing if you can't afford that price
gap and you don't care about thermals in
the mid-range the best card is easily
and these are 92 80
for two hundred dollars because it's
just simply an unbeatable price and the
performance is on par with a 770 which
is fifty dollars more actually better
than the 77 need a lot of cases the 770
is what we recommend if you want Nvidia
very strongly if you have use for their
software or if you are using CUDA
enabled applications like premiere Sony
Vegas and things like that the 760 is
what we would recommend if you can't
afford the two-hundred-dollar 280x and
or you can and you really just have a
strong feeling toward end video which
you should not buy that way but I
understand that some people can get like
that when they've been screwed by one
company or another so that is an
alternative do know it will perform
significantly lower in frame rate than
the 280 x but it's a bit cheaper and
it's a good card anyway so it'll still
play everything on high no problem
moving down into the the budget range
we've got the r9 270 for our go to and
the gtx 750ti if you can't quite afford
it or if you want something that's got a
zero cable requirement and lower TDP
finally the r7 260x is easily our go-to
for sub $100 just I would honestly push
a lot of you toward at least the 750 ti
from the 260x or toward a 270 because
the the performance difference is fairly
substantial but there are definitely use
cases for a 260x like an htpc or a low
end gaming PC where you're just playing
something like some low-end demos and
things like that so it is something to
consider if you're in that range the 750
passive would be the alternative to that
if you have very specific htpc
requirements otherwise don't get it
because it doesn't perform that great at
the end of the day compared to these
mid-range and budget cards so that's all
for this video please hit the link in
the description below if you need more
help and I will see you all next time
peace
