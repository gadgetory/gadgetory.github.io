GN as always leave your questions in the
comment section below for next week I
think we're gonna do one main one for
this week and then the patreon asked yet
in question which can get
patreon.com/scishow and axis so we'll
probably do another one but we're going
to Taiwan in a couple of days here so
just for times sake poly lemonade ins
one I'm gonna talk more about that
Computex trip momentarily so a lot of
good questions for this week one of them
address on the icy graphite thermal pads
a lot of you are really interested I do
not blame you at all I'm interested too
but we'll get to that in a moment before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal Grizzlies high-end thermal paste
and liquid metal thermal Grizzlies cryo
knot is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below okay so first
of all the Computex stuff if you're not
familiar with it if you're new to the
industry or to this channel we go to
Taipei Taiwan every year for a show
called Computex this is going on our 3rd
year now and it's like CES except bigger
and more relevant so Computex is
gigantic it's over 200 thousand
attendees I think it's probably
approaching 300 thousand depends on how
you count it we're gonna be talking to
most the hardware companies in the
industry some of its scheduled some of
its not because they're just all over a
4-story Convention Center you can it's
kind of like memory manufacturers all
next to each other in case manufacturers
next to each other for the most part so
we can just kind of hit each booth and
see what's up
some of them we do schedule they tend to
be in hotel suites if they're American
companies a lot of them prefer that
route probably for cost-saving reasons
so anyway we're gonna be there the show
starts June 5th we're gonna start
coverage on I think the 3rd or the 4th
pretty early we have one factory tour
scheduled we have a ton of interviews
scheduled and meetings about new
products and basically you should
subscribe if you're not so you can catch
all that stuff
should be a lot of fun though if you
have really specific requests here's
what I'd like you to do so as the shows
going on if you see some news of some
product that you're interested in that
we haven't covered and you think that we
can provide a unique perspective then
please tweet at me that's the best way
to reach us during the show it's at
gamers and axes let us know who the
vendor is and what the product is we'll
see if we can go check it out if time
allows and that's probably the best way
to get us out there we try to be try to
keep the technical approach at these
trade shows so I do tend to have more
specification information I'm asking for
at the booths then I think a lot of
channels do and also not afraid to say
something that's let's say that
something so excited booth anyway let's
get into questions so first one here is
from Oh
also one more thing bring me in Japan
briefly after Taipei just basically we
decided to stop there on the way back
because it's kind of on the way so it
should be pretty fun we're gonna go to
Akihabara I think and see if we can do a
video there but anyway if you have ideas
about what we can do in Tokyo that's
related to technology please let me know
because I haven't prepared for that part
of the trip at all so if you know
anything about Tokyo and Technology
computers anything related to what we do
even some what let me know what it is
and hopefully we can go make a video
about it all right first question Robert
dip was to put this I don't know so
gamers Nexus I would really like to get
your take on the icy graphite throne
pads that are supposedly capable of
replacing throne pace since they're also
reusable they could be great value for
the money
your in-depth testing is about the only
channel I trust with results and I
believe your audience would be
interested I agree and I'm interested
too or probably look at it be looking at
it after copies acts for timing reasons
I mean the thing is this is something
I've been interested in it's just we
have so much going on it's really hard
to prioritize avers bu and we're working
on stuff so I'll try and look at it keep
bugging me about it in the comments we
get back in June so look at it then but
here's the one thing I will say is I
think the graphite thermal pads are way
over hyped I have done some preliminary
looking into them and I think they're
really not deserving of the amount of
praise they're getting like it's this is
not new technology this stuff has been
around there's a reason there's not a
lot of it on the market and we've done
testing of this stuff before where I've
tested some for I can only can't share a
lot of it right now but I've tested pads
of substances that are not thermal paste
in the past and often times it's it's
sort of billed as a lot more than it is
in terms of performance like they're
cool they're kind of reusable there's
still downsides to using them and
ultimately there's a reason why a lot of
people use paste so some of these pad
like interfaces that I've tested and III
don't know what I'm gonna be able to
talk about them if ever but because it
was a prototype but some of the the pad
type interfaces that replace thermal
paste for CPU to cooler contact are are
really pretty bad and some of them are
okay but I haven't yet encountered one
that's better than comparable their own
pay is really good metal depending on
what you're doing
one interesting thing is the really thin
pads I would be curious to see how they
perform between the die and the IHS I've
done some testing on it it was never the
problem with it was if you're using a
conductive one that's a bit harder to
protect against if especially if it if
it has a phase change or something like
that which anyway up hopefully I can
share more with you something but in the
meantime the icy graphite stuff yeah
I'll try I see will seriously try when
we get back let's see if we get hit with
a way of GPUs or not and then I'll know
I don't know if we have time but to kind
of give you some immediate thoughts
though I do think it's way over hyped
it's an interesting product it has use
cases it's worth playing around with
but thermal testings really hard like we
revised our thermal testing almost every
day I mean we we kind of specialize in
it for GPS especially you haven't seen a
lot of it cuz there are no new GPS but
we've specialized it in for a bit and
it's hard to do it right computer
software is really difficult to work
with there are million variables with a
test bench so even if you control
everything to the best ability even
every single voltage in BIOS which you
have to do this software is still hard
to control so basically you need like a
current clamp on the EPS 12 volt cables
you need a reliable software that reads
the power of the CPU because power is
what generates heat so you need to
control those two things very
specifically and then also go through
all the voltages and bios and manually
set them no auto allowed ever for that
kind of CPU thermal testing and also use
software that you can control to a
relative degree of certainty and then
run multiple repeat tests instead of
throwing out outliers inspect them and
see why are they an outlier if it
deserves to be thrown out and throw it
out but it's it's pretty hard to do
thermal testing accurately we revised it
constantly I would imagine that a lot of
user testing online and I haven't looked
at other media outlets truthfully I
really haven't looked at other media
outlet reviews of these pads but I would
be cautious of trusting thermal testing
from random sources on the internet
because it's hard to do it accurately
and also even if they do it accurately
it's probably not comparable to person
B's test from person a test because
there's so many ways to do thermal
testing if it's not controlled then you
might just be looking at two different
scenarios where it might from well and
one not the other or you could just have
a bunch of useless data so next question
game Varys says how are graphics card
water blocks made this is a really good
question are the machine from bar stock
or cast and then finished by a mill I'm
not an expert on manufacturing but I can
do some research so looked around a bit
talk to some people as well EK water
blocks plexi parts like their terminals
are made out of cnc machined or they are
cnc machined from solid acrylic pieces
that are cast and most blocks are
machined and there's actually a great
video from aqua computer will put it up
on the screen hopefully if the editors
catch this but their aqua computer shows
how the blocks are made mostly using
CNCs and mill attachments and even
polishing attachments to basically the
CNC part subtracts out unwanted material
to make the channels and a lot of water
blocks use milling and machining some of
them are cast they tend to be a bit
cheaper according to our friend VSG from
thermal bench if they are cast but most
are machined or or produced in the
fashion you've seen with aqua computer
some of these companies collect the
remaining scrap metals recycling aqua
computers one of them so aqua computer
basically as they subtract out the
copper they don't want it gets kind of
pushed aside eventually filtered out
recycled goes to scrap material
companies and they don't make a ton of
money from it but it helps offset costs
a bit and then there's also a
lubrication solvent that's used as the
channels are created so it helps with
the heat that's generated from the
milling devices they get really hot just
from friction and then and speed and
also helps with the cleaning things out
its solvent and lubricant so that gets
filtered actually communities as well
it's pretty recyclable unlike water
which gets dirty and useless with time
so that's pretty cool as well anyway
that's about the most I know so I do
really like the question hopefully that
gives to you the basics of it and this
kind of made me think like oh we should
just go visit one of these factories
sometime and make a video so we'll play
do that next question is from the EULA
who says downdraft coolers are actually
worse in all caps at cooling the VRM
then tower coolers they're blowing hot
air from the CPU right off on top of the
vrm some of that hot air circulates back
into the downdraft cooler at our cooler
on the other hand blows hot air right
out of the PC and sucks some air by
negative
from the VRM okay so first of all this
blanket statement is a really flat place
to go saying things like downdraft
coolers are worse at cooling the BRM and
howard coolers is for sure going to make
you incorrect and at least a few
instances you might be right insomnia
will be wrong on others cooling is
complicated the design of the case
impacts how it works the design of the
cooler impacts how true this statement
is so we've as someone who has done
testing on this properly and in depth
the thing is and I see you mentioned
hardware and box - I haven't seen their
video but it looks like what you're
doing here I'm not saying anything about
their content I haven't seen it but what
you are doing by commenting on their
content you're saying they have a tower
cooler outperforming Wraith and cooling
the BRM well there are different coolers
so it's possible yes that is how a
cooler especially with a low enough fan
which we've tested can cool vrm
components better in some instances than
a downdraft cooler it's also possible as
we've tested that a tower cooler with a
Crabby fan particularly one that's
that's higher up from the socket doesn't
get any air over the vrm both will be
better in general than a front-mounted
CLC which is just pulling it's pushing a
hot air into the case because well it's
pulling in cold air and that's going
through a radiator it's pushing hot air
into the case and if you have no other
fan than the case we're assuming a
basically closed system then that would
be the worst case if you have a tower
cooler and no other fans in the system
that would be better than what I just
described but a tower cooler versus a
downdraft cooler the answer is it
depends so the first two things are more
or less concrete for the most part and
tower versus downdraft efficacy is going
to depend on what kind of fan is used
where is it positioned and are there any
other fans in the system also where the
mesh ventilation ports if there are any
how small is the box is it an ITX box if
it is then it's possible that in some
instances a downdraft could be better
and some could be worse because you
don't
it depends on where the ventilation
ports are if there are any again and and
also just how crammed it is in there so
to say just flat out that downdraft
coolers are actually worse at the BRM
cooling than tower coolers is incorrect
because it's a blanket statement that's
correct sometimes and it's very wrong on
other times so for the point of its
blowing hot air from the CPU on to the
vrm okay but it's blowing air on to the
vrm so it's still getting air onto these
components potentially even over a heat
sink in most cases which is going to be
better than stagnant air flow which is
what you'll get with some tower coolers
that have their fan position too high up
or just a really bad low pressure fan
and a lot of those exist especially some
of the hybrid two 12's because not all
of them but hybrid t12 is these
different fans depending on what
production run you get and some of them
stock more than others so yeah I mean
any airflow is better than no airflow
the fact that the air air has been
warmed is really sort of irrelevant
because you're talking about an air
temperature that's maybe like 40 degrees
Celsius a vrm can get up to like 100
plus like for a MOSFET so you're not
making it worse that's for damn sure
next one demage I don't want to give my
real name okay that's easier it says
some question is it better to plug in
the computer then turn on the power
supply or is it better to turn on the
power supply and then plug in the
computer or does it not matter same
question reverse no reason I'm including
this is because actually kind of is very
simple but also a good question and also
brings us back to basics of it the only
reason it would matter is if you
sometimes you get an instant-on signal
from it depends on like the last state
of the motherboard in the system it may
have been powered down in a way that
it's going to attempt to boot as soon as
it detects PS arm or as soon as it
detects standby voltage from power
supply once you flip the switch so if
that's the case or I've had some power
supplies that'll just turn on when you
plug them in
even if you know with the switch set to
on by the way even if you don't push any
kind of button or trigger anything a lot
of that is just gonna depend on the
motherboard so what's the last known
stay to the motherboard is it trying to
send a signal to the power so I turn it
on so I would just recommend plug it in
and we or actually plug all your cables
in first of all and then turn on the
power supply last so plug in the cable
flip the switch later it doesn't really
matter a whole lot but just in case
there's like a non signal coming from
the motherboard as soon as you plug
everything in and flip the switch just
make sure all your cables are plugged
into the motherboard but it really
doesn't matter a whole lot it's just
kind of just make sure your stuff's
plugged in just in case because like for
example in a nightmare scenario you
could have me forgotten PCIe cables
maybe one of them to a video card or
something that can actually cause damage
in some instances as depends on the
video card what kind of protection
everything that the motherboard the
video card in power supply have but you
don't want to cause any damage
unnecessarily so next one is a hand let
me read that plug theater turn on power
supply or turn the power supply plug in
the computer yeah I go with what I said
next doesn't matter a whole lot though
next one T mmm this is a bit of a shot
in Freud but question but would you care
to elaborate a bit on what were the very
worst products that went through the GN
gauntlet the Zalman z1 was one of the
worst that was a case man that was that
was bad case it's also not a great video
I mean like it was good content from us
but the video quality was not good it's
a long time ago
so the z1 was bad enough I'm fine
sharing this publicly now given how much
distance there is right it was bad
enough that we when we met with Zalman
the next time at an event basically the
entire time was spent talking about that
case and then later they called me they
talked about like this is a long time
ago this before we really sold a lot of
ads or anything like that it really had
much income they called me and they were
like we want to round it out with you
and I thought okay this is seems like
strange timing but
but let's talk business and I gave them
a couple numbers they came back with
really bad offerings and and then after
we kind of had a loose agreement on a
potential deal they were like okay can
you remove one last thing can you do the
review I said no like no you no of
course not that's not how this works
so that had never happened terminate the
agreement obviously and we never worked
with them again because that's pretty
screwed up so that was our last dealing
with Zalman because that the z1 was bad
but bribing wait worse so anyway that I
don't know what their status is even
these days their parent company was kind
of killed from some kind of scandal so
and just to be clear we haven't had that
happen since or from any other company
it's the only instance we actually
published an article talking about some
of the underside underhanded things that
people in the industry have done it was
all anonymous this was years ago I
anonymized who did what and just said
this is wrong don't do it and we haven't
had a problem since so I think the
people in the industry got that message
and and no more shady to that
extent happened since that time other
bad products I guess really bad ones I
mean I didn't like the age 500p and I
would it was certainly not that was more
of bad marking though because the the
base of it was still an okay product so
in terms of like like the frame like
literally the shell and the two fans and
then they made it into a good really
good product that we recommend highly
with a chayote match so I wouldn't put
that in that category because there was
mostly marketing that was bad in that
instance man what was a really truly bad
product that we looked at
Oh another case the Rose will gun near
that one just came to mind that was a
pretty bad product
mostly cases we've worked with some
video cards that had really bad drivers
but the products were eventually okay I
think most of stuff that we really hated
was for adjacent reasons that were
correct well like like drivers or
changing the mesh on the front of the
case or whatever stuff like that but
really the the worst one was the Zalman
z1 the Rosewell Goong near was very bad
and we've had a couple of really oddball
products like some of the low-end Intel
CPUs just don't make any sense
whatsoever to buy in terms of the value
I don't know that I'd say they're bad
because it's not like they're broken or
anything they're just really bad value
same for something in the AMD CP is like
some of the a series ap is the original
like the non vague ap is something
there's a really bad value also so but
not bad products necessarily anyway
we've we've reviewed a lot of bad
products but we kind of review them then
I forget about them so the names of most
of them escaped me
Oh coolers for sure though they're
definitely some really bad coolers out
there that we've looked at that
Coolermaster cheap on the master liquid
one leaked when we used it because the
screws they provided with it had enough
of a variance in the length that one of
them was just long enough to escape
tolerance of hitting the radiator when
you screw it in and most comp actually
like all of the companies from those
part with liquid coolers have a little
metal shield between the screw and the
radiator so that it can't cause a leak
and also if not that then they have fins
back there instead of a tube so if you
do screw in too far because the
tolerance was bad from the factory with
the screw then worst case scenario it
destroys like a piece of a fin doesn't
really matter as opposed to going
through a tube so that was I would say
that was a bad product and then we also
worked with an old like a Peltier cooler
basically and I can't really
but that one was pretty bad - it was it
was almost $200 and very complicated had
power going into it and everything and
didn't cool any better than like a $40
92 millimeter cooler so that was not a
bad product can't any of it though all
right we have some work coming up - but
oh also the scam they like to terabyte
USB key we reviewed except it was
actually like 8 gigabytes it says 2
terabytes in actually might even last so
that's 2 terabytes in Windows but it
tricks you so they spoof it and then in
reality it's like 4 or 8 gigabytes and
as you write more data it'll just it'll
either fill up and give an error or
it'll start overwriting the previous
data so that was really bad product as
well cables we worked with some cables
that were just straight scams like a now
that coming back to me we're going back
like years in history now by 6 DVI cable
so there are a lot of DVI cables that
will advertise as dual link ie more
bandwidth and capable of driving a
different you know a higher resolution
or higher refresh and they'll advertise
dual link they'll even have the pins for
it but then if you just do a simple
continuity check like with a multimeter
just check and 1 2 n 2 pin a two pin a
on either side and in some of those fake
dual link DVI cables that will come back
I mean it's it's not continuous there's
no wire in there it's just two pins so
those are bad products to you the best
way to tell a dual link DVI cable is
real enough that's relevant anymore
is if it's super fat because if it is
then it probably has the extra wires in
there for those pins but a lot of fakes
out there a lot of scams that we've
looked at I think that's most of it it's
probably probably most her right now
we've looked at a lot of bad VR stuff
but a lot of bad games I think of more
I'll let you know next one gamer games
is water cooling Ram worth it featuring
a data spectryx dat jellyfish and any
programs the stras memory not really
know it's like it's kind of interesting
and the jellyfish stuff is a good way to
get some attention as a memory manufac
for making a component that for the most
part is a commodity at this point where
you just pick kind of what's the most
affordable so it's a good way to get
attention totally unnecessary and ddr4
especially it's already low voltage it's
low heat even we were running 4000
megahertz tight timings for that repel
tt stream and it didn't need a fan on
the memory now older versions of DDR you
could do a some cooling but you didn't
need that next one commander Flint does
enabling the AI GPU on Intel CPUs impact
CPU overclock thermals or performance in
general some dx12 titles and certainly
benchmarks are beginning to make use of
explicit multi-gpu and can potentially
make use of integrated graphics on Intel
CPUs minimal game gains given the
relatively feeble nature of it but games
nonetheless surely having another piece
of silicon act of drawing power and
creating heat on the CPI will have
negative impact on the CPU itself so
potentially if they're using more power
jointly than yes you're gonna end up
with more heat it's all it all comes
down to how much power is being used
under that IHS and whenever you have
more power being used it's gonna be
hotter for everything under it that said
in our premiere benchmark we actually
found there was a less power consumption
by about two there in terms of current
it was about two amps less with or two
to fewer amps running the IGP versus not
and that's because what happens is the
IGP is accelerating to a point that the
cpu doesn't need to do as much work
anymore so you end up with with lower
power consumption overall to the extent
of like 20 watts 24 watts in that
scenario which means that the CPU will
be cooler the IGP will be warmer but but
not unreasonably warm and so between the
two of them you end up actually better
off overall as for games DX 12 titles I
do not think you'll end up ahead by
using an Intel IGP with explicit multigp
if it's even supported I would have I'd
be hard-pressed to find one use an IDE
P with a DGP you I don't think you're
gonna end off ahead but yeah I don't
know I haven't really tested I'm not
aware of any titles that are able to do
that but I hope the rest of it answers
your question though more powers more
heat Boone says I know this is getting
really picky but have you considered
adding a snap to the left side of the
Maud map for a common ground point given
where I want to put one I really need
the ground connection on the left side
of the mat I'm sure I could run an
extension to it would be so much neater
if I didn't have to Yukio management OC
strikes again I'm also open to modding
my mom had super meta you need a mod
Matt - my other mod Matt any suggestions
on adding a snap on my own match without
having to buy a minimum pack of 100 or
more of these things what are the specs
of the snap we have it on the site
they're 10 millimeter snaps so on this
side if you wanted to mod your own I
don't know where you can buy the snaps
individually I haven't looked and I
don't think you'd really be able to done
it you wouldn't really be able to pull
this out to cleanly it'll leave a bit of
a mess and damage some of the rubber
around it I mean I've done it because I
when I was prototyping them I put my own
hole in the mat and like put a snap in
it which I pulled off of another one
that I spent like $100 on so not the
best solution but yeah it's a this is a
10 millimeter male stud and this is a 10
millimeter female snap so that's the the
parts now I haven't looked about where
you can buy them I'm sure you can find
it on eBay or something and then you'd
basically just get something to poke a
hole in this side obviously we don't
officially recommend modding it but I
totally understand why you would want to
so if you want to do that you find
something poke a hole in there cleanly
and find the the snap and everything if
you're really concerned about it send us
an email support at gamers nexus net and
do me a favor do a bit of the work for
us cuz I have a support guy who does
that stuff but for a technical question
I'll have to get in there so do me a
favor if you do email specifically some
links so the things you're thinking of
buying and I'll let you know if it'll be
compatible with this common ground point
and hopefully make sure everything works
cleanly for you as for adding one
if more of you want like a second snap
on this side I mean it sound off in the
comments and we'll look into it I don't
think it would be too big of a deal to
do that I had a second one and I think
that's all for this one so thank you for
watching as always go to
patreon.com/scishow can next stop
directly and get the bonus episode and
that'll be it for now we'll do more when
we're in Taipei at Computex so subscribe
for that gonna store it on Karen's Nexus
net to pick up the mod mat I was just
talking about we had a quick update
these are in stock like here and they're
shipping so it's no longer a backorder
if you want one it'll basically ship you
know within a day of you ordering it so
thanks for watching and I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
