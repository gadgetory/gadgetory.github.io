days on troubleshooting GT X 1080 FTW
vrm heat issues including independent
validation of EVGA x' two solutions for
owners of affected cards that article
was posted last night you can see it on
the screen here or hit the link in the
description below for the full thing and
the article included thermal images and
testing of cards with and without
thermal pads as well as cards with and
without the V BIOS update we'll be
recapping all of that here before
getting to that this content is brought
to you by and the free sync devices
including this $400 LG 34 um 68 - P
ultra wide display which is a 2560 by
1080 display you can learn more in the
link below if you're not sure what's
going on we've got two articles one of
them recaps the issue basically Tom's
Hardware in Germany Tom's de found that
some of the EVGA cards they were testing
the 1080 FTW in the case of what we're
validating we're hitting temperatures
around 114 C when looking at the back of
the card and that's for the vrm
temperature specifically vrm is by the
way can sustain pretty high temperatures
so we'll talk about if it's good or not
in a moment but it's not the same as a
GPU where your limit is really like a
hundred Celsius or something around that
range so Tom's saw that we posted an
article recapping the issue we spoke
with builds IDE an overclocker to talk
about the BRM and what it's capable of
and now just last night published an
article that looks at the thermals using
thermal imaging of a card with out a
solution so this is the stock card that
shipped originally no thermal pads
between the back plate and the back of
the card and and no thermal pads where
they were added with the fix which is
this version that's got a thermal pad
mod to it and we also looked at some V
bio stuff so with Tom's article they saw
of erm temperatures up to around 114 CV
Ram was also pretty high and this was a
result of EVGA s decision to skip
thermal pads for some of their cards
affected cards are shown on the screen
now and all of these are also applicable
to receive a V BIOS update or free
thermal pad mod from EVGA well talk
about this more an hour
testing peace but first note that the
vrm can handle well over 100 C in worst
case scenarios t-junction of EVGA SBR M
is about 150 C with ambient at 125 C the
power stages are recommended at 100 C by
on semi in their datasheet so that is
directly from the supplier or a 125 C T
case still hitting 114 Celsius is really
approaching a fine line where poor
conditions could trip a runaway thermal
scenario especially since the backplate
was effectively acting as a hot box
before applying thermal pads the
backplate in the base plate were mostly
just trapping heat with no interface to
transfer the build-up from the power
stages or FETs to the heatsink itself
but we've got builds or joining us in a
few days to talk about this in greater
depth and I'm currently running
endurance tests on the 1080 FTW with and
without thorough pads and we'll be doing
so in both torture and real-world
scenarios will be using poor airflow
cases also for further validation and
the goal is to determine whether or not
the EVGA 1080 FTW was ever at risk of
burning its power delivery system EVGA a
solution has been to supply free thermal
pads to users to either apply themselves
or they can do a swap with EVGA to get
them applied or a new card from EVGA if
they're really concerned but when I
talked to EVGA steam last night we were
also informed that the company will be
applying a BIOS update and this BIOS
update doesn't change anything other
than the fan speed curve the fan rpm so
these fans will spend more aggressively
with that update instead of an RPM of
around 1600 to 1700 in for example a
high load scenario fir mark or a game
where you're basically hitting about a
55% maybe 60% fan speed instead of that
fan speed of around 1700 the new update
for the cards will push the fans beat to
2200 rpm which is a pretty decent
increase really so we've got thermal
testing I've imaged these cards and I
also did a noise test to see how that
rpm change impacts the performance and
we're able to test both of these cards
with and without the backplate so we'll
go into all that stuff now because our
temperature measurements are through the
back of the PCB the actual temperature
may be a few degrees higher on the front
side where the vrm is we use the thermal
to probe some of the vrm components
directly and saw a delta of about 4 to 5
Celsius against the rear side
measurement here are two side-by-side
thermal images of EB J's 1080 FTW vrm
close up with the max temperature
indicators on the screen as taken at an
ambient of 22 Celsius the left image is
before EVGA z' bios update the right
images after the bios update with a more
aggressive fan rpm and this is without
the thermal pads applied yet anyway
between the two we're seeing a
difference of about 14 Celsius results
and of the jump from 1600 1700 to 2200
rpm and this brings the vrm temperature
down to well within reasonable operating
range remember they can run hotter than
other silicon components that you're
used to and it's still warmer than some
competition but certainly not
overheating the fan speed change will
bring the ACX cooled 1080 FTW cards down
well under maximum safe specification
once coupled with the thermal pads
especially but the new fan speed will
curve to hit 2200 rpm or a jump to about
80 percent of total fan speed of using
afterburner and precision from the
original about 60% max 65 for generally
60 we've performed initial DB testing to
look at the change in noise output
versus the fan rpm the test platform
used for this noise test used all
passive cooling the CPU and power spider
passively cooled in an open-air test
bench with no fans attached the only
device making noise was this video card
and the noise floor of the room is about
26 DB and has already been accounted for
in these metrics test methodologies to
find more heavily in our GP reviews on
the website that will outline at all in
more detail in the next article that
research is this stuff a bit more
heavily noises at about 30 8.6 DB for
the GTX 980 FTW before the V BIOS mod
when the vrm was much hotter in the fan
speed was lower and so the fan was Auto
controlled its peak around 1600 rpm in
this test scenario the post v bios
change simulated based on EB J's direct
advice to G n by simply changing the fan
rpm to 2200 manually is at forty 7.1 DB
or a perceived increase to the user that
is just shy of a 2x and gain in volume
we'll talk more about noise levels and
the
have increased shortly in the next
content again once we've got more time
to really test the cards with hidden
enclosures and in the open-air bench
this final look is another side by side
thermal image this time with the GTX
tennety FTW with thermal pads installed
and the original fan speed on one side
versus thermal pads installed and the
new fan speed update on the other side
so you've basically got both solutions
here or just one of them with the
thermal pads just installing the thermal
pads and leaving the fan and BIOS alone
temperature is close to 85 Celsius when
probes through the backplate but a
direct thermocouple probe to the PCB
shows us closer to 90 Celsius still has
a significant reduction from the
original stock model of the card and
with both applied we're nearing ADC on
the backside which is pretty damn good
overall and actually becoming
competitive with Twin Frozr in two other
coolers so as always we'll have more
depth in the article below it's already
published it's basically this stuff just
with a bit more text around it to
explain what's going on I am working on
actively doing some more tests we and
Darren's tested one of these cards
already need to do the other need to do
a couple torture tests and mitx or poor
airflow ATX cases things like that so
we'll be back subscribe to make sure you
catch the next version the next look for
this couple part series where I'm gonna
be joined by builds Lloyd will talk
about the VR and what its capabilities
are things like that but so far EVGA
solutions are looking good so these
changes they've made adjust the fan
update alone is pretty helpful but you
do get a big noise increase so I would
recommend taking their free thermal pads
because you don't have to pay for it
they'll ship them to you you apply it
yourself we will be filming today so by
the time you see this it'll be just
hours away we'll be filming a tutorial
on how to install those thermal pads
it's pretty easy but if you're
uncomfortable EVGA will do it for you or
they can even do a basically across RMA
exchange where they ship you a card as
yours is going back to them so you're
not out of a card for too long so that's
the news that's what's going on with EB
J's cards more in the near future as
