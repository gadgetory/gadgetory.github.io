nexus nada and today we're looking at
the gtx 980ti video cards in sli that's
two of them i found out we had a second
one so we did an SLI test and I tested
these in SLI against two gtx 980 s at
titan x of course and then a whole suite
of other video cards we didn't include
some of the lower end cards because
they're out of the price range of this
so for SLI testing we're mostly looking
at the 980 TI is of course and the 980 s
and the price drop of $50 brings the 980
down to 500 dollars for a single card
it's $1000 for SLI in this case there's
six fifty each so that's thirteen
hundred dollars for SLI and the Titan X
is a single video card solution at about
$1000 flat betting on who you buy from
and the type max we already talked about
is sort of invalidated as a value by
card and this is because the 980ti is
$350 cheaper and gives about the same
performance in most games so the only
place you're buying to type nice at this
point is if you're planning to do SLI of
those because that would give you a
tremendous performance output that you
don't get from some of these other
solutions so to quickly recap the specs
of the gtx 980ti
it's got 28 16 cuda cores the titan max
has 30 72 the nine 80s a little bit
lower than both of those and the base
clock of the 980ti is a thousand
megahertz so we ran these tests at the
1,000 megahertz base clock and bruised
is 1075 or something like that I've got
an overclocking video already on the
channel check out the channel if you're
curious how the 980ti overclocks
it was pretty good it was about a 40% OC
in terms of clock rate so about 20% game
so that's the recap of that we've done
SLI testing a few times on the channel
now but let's just quickly recap how SLI
works SLI is an invidious form of a
multi GPU solution it uses a scalable
link interface bridge or sli bridge to
connect two or more video cards for
sharing and processing power and things
like that and these solution is called
crossfire on paper they perform pretty
similarly in terms of how they interact
with the bridges do but in practice it's
really down to drivers and game
implementations to dictate how SLI
crossfire whatever multi-gpu solutions
actually perform in game SLI bridges the
video card so they share pixel
processing power and other processing
power they do not share video ram so
vram does not stack we don't get 12
gigabytes because we've got 6 &amp;amp; 6 in
this case GTA 5 is an interesting game
and that it shows your vram consumption
as a slider bar and this is actually a
pretty cool thing but it's a little bit
wrong in that it shows the stacked video
RAM value so if you've got two cards at
6 gigabytes each it'll show 12 it's not
really how it works you don't get to use
12 gigabytes just because you've got two
sets of six in your solution but with
DirectX 12 things are changing and
that's because of a couple of things
dx12 is introducing a lot of stuff like
split frame rendering instead of
alternate frame rendering which is what
we use right now and it's also going to
allow sharing the video RAM between
solutions and further it'll allow using
non the same brand video cards for SLR
crossfire configurations and in theory
you could combine AM D and Nvidia in a
single multi-gpu solution with DirectX
12 whether this will work is sort of a
question of drivers and game
optimizations but on paper it as
possible the current AFR alternate frame
rendering version of SLI introduces some
low 1% and 0.1% frame rate outputs for
gaming so this is a question of frame
times the 99th 99.9% I'll frames are
sometimes lower in performance than a
single GTX 980 or 98 TI for instance and
this is because of CPU overhead DirectX
API overhead which we've done a video on
and other inefficiencies in the pipeline
a lot of which will be resolved with
dx12 but dx12 isn't a magic bullet we've
got bottlenecks elsewhere like lane
availability with Haswell the non
eversion has well they're only 16 PCIe
lanes on the CPU and eight on the PCH
platform controller hub also known as
the chipset the current line series
chipsets by Intel the h 97 and z97
chipset offer eight lanes so we've got a
total of 24 16 CPU
a chipset and that's not enough to do by
16 by 16 x16 x16 if you want to call it
that GPU configurations for multi GPUs
and this is something that's a bit
curious so you've seen some motherboards
like our gigabyte z97 X board we bought
for testing will actually list x16 x16
as a possible configuration for multi
GPUs and you're honoring how this is
possible when there aren't 32 lanes
available it's because of multiplexing
so you can have Apex chip on the board
and that's this is what it looks like
it's made by plx and pecks multiplexing
is basically taking multiple erotic
signals converging on one point and it
outputs a single signal and then does
what's called switching so in the device
manager you'll see PCI downstream switch
ports these are the device manager
representation for what's going on when
you're multiplexing your lanes and
multiplexing lanes basically means that
you're optimizing the land division
between multiple ports for multiple
devices so if one device is more heavily
loaded than another the multiplexing
chip will divert some of the lane
availability to the more heavily loaded
device and take away from another device
that is less heavily loaded and this is
just an optimization technique that
doesn't create more lanes so if all
devices are under full load it's not
going to help you there but it does
effectively artificially produce more
lanes strictly in the fact that it
optimizes where the lanes are divided
between devices depending on which board
you're using it's questionable how much
of a performance gain this gives you and
depending on what gq-- you're using
because if you're loading all of your
GPUs it doesn't do anything for you but
it is a technology that we use in our
test motherboard because we've found
that it actually does allow for like
four-way SLI configurations on z97
without too much of a performance hit
let's talk about the benchmarks now for
the 980ti is in sli so these benches
were run in comparison to our previous
980ti single solution and 980 sli
solution in our testing sli generally
saw a rough sixteen to twenty percent
increase in performance over to a gtx
980 non ti sli and it's a noteworthy
game
but values still questionable because
it's at $1,300 the TI versions raise a
thousand for the sli 980 s one thing
that does become clear though is that a
single Titan X has really pretty poor
value right now with the launch of the
980 TI and the price drop of the 980 but
multiple Titan X's would offer
unachievable performance elsewhere so if
you're looking at that as a solution
it's still valid it wouldn't be great
value but you get the performance and at
that point you really don't care about
value if your SLI in Titan maxes it's
not a thing you're concerned about in
some of these charts you'll notice that
sli 980 s and sli 980 TI s perform
effectively identically and this is
strange on paper it's likely due to CP
bottlenecking on a 4790k Seaview or
software side bottlenecking in the games
but most games sans Metro have 1440p and
grid at 4k show a healthy difference in
performance upwards of about 20% as I
said you can view the full article link
in the description below on the website
where we have all the charts test
methodology things like that we explain
the 1% immerse point one percent frames
and now it's just a matter of value so
is it worth it with 980 TI is in sli
you're spending $1300 versus 980 s in
SLI at $1000 the Titan X we sort of rule
out at this point because a single GPU
solution if you're buying just one of
them it's not good value even against a
single 980ti which is $350 cheaper and
performs pretty close just has half the
vram a 20% gain for $300 is questionable
I think for a lot of system builders but
if it's not for you that it's a good
solution you're gaining about point zero
six percent per dollar if you look at it
that way and although the value is
questionable at $300 gained over 980 is
in sli that's really up to you to decide
if that's worth it one thing I will say
is that for the first time in my
benchmarking history far cry 4 was
actually producing a fluid and playable
framerate without the odd stuttering and
hiccuping that we normally get a 4k
testing so that was thanks to the ti SLI
version 9 80s and SLI are pretty similar
but you have to drop a few settings to
get what I'm talking about and then
single GPU solutions really kind of
struggle at 4k in Far Cry 4 so that is
our 980ti sli benchmark you can check
the link in the description below for
the full article thanks for watching as
always a huge
- icon Greg and Rob for being our first
three patreon backers it's a big help to
have the support of the viewers and
community so we can rely more on you
guys and less on advertising which is
pretty important because we do post a
lot of critical videos so that is all
for this content if you like this type
of stuff check the channel for more
980ti information sorry I'm a bit
nasally I'm pretty sick right now but
that is all for this time I will see you
all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
