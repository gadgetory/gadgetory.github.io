Paul s hardware and Kyle haul ass
hardware that's my new channel to get it
off the ground thanks for the plug Steve
yeah subscribe no that's that's an S
period hardware and then bit with Kyle
so Kyle just screwed both of us over and
also live kind of screwed yourselves did
all the heavy lifting for me
no should've known math all of us before
that this video is brought to you by the
open bench table a lightweight and ultra
portable test bench built with
high-quality anodized aluminum and with
a modular approach to design the open
bench table is easy to collapse store
and assemble to test different parts and
is one of the test benches that we use
in the GN labs the open bench table
contains everything you need to test PC
builds and configurations and it's
available in silver black red and a mini
ITX version learn more at the link in
the description below I got you Kyle
when you were planning bit winter knit
with what was the process for choosing
the questions you chose because you had
if you haven't see check his channel I'm
sure it'll be up sometime within the
next couple of weeks but so so it's ok
so here's the deal this is like episode
3 or 4 for us the first time that has
actually had like youtuber celebrity
guys and stuff like that I guess you
guys were celebrities a surprise usually
it's just random people on the street
right yeah I meet up a Craigslist and so
I don't know who I'm gonna get so I just
have to use like to make the question
super easy just to be more inclusive for
everyone but for you guys I was like
this is what they do they're the
professionals experts whatever whatever
once again so I spent about two hours
last night curating these five questions
trying to find something that was a bit
more challenging and difficult and I
think I overshot my goal because well
you guys you guys should watch the
episode anyway if you haven't yet but
some they gave me valiant effort a for
now probably tried our best
April effort a forever yeah but now all
the people who have watched that would
earn it would know the answers to those
questions and knowing the answers to
those questions you asked I think it
will be very helpful for lots of people
yes later in life yes I
have to know exactly what the
specifications are of 1870 and e360 I
can save your life one day because you
could this is relevant
all right so CES topics Paul you you
were just honest about killer robots
Kyle what did what did you what did you
see what did you think so we did we did
see some pretty cool stuff I was talking
to you earlier about the other capella
ex LED technology than more serious now
trying to implement and things I know
it's like it's RGB and stuff but it's
like it's almost like RGB is so so
ingrained now that it's just you even
get tired of it seeing it all the same
so it's actually innovation in RGB which
is kind of cool it's like alright give
me something a little bit different and
it looks like they're trying to push
things forward in that way also I went
to the fantex booth and saw some pretty
cool stuff there
the the Lux queue looks pretty promising
especially all the flexibility in there
you can fit like dual 360 and dual 4 80s
at the same time it's a dual system
chassis in general and it's got well you
want to take stuff you had the fan sex
as well right actually didn't visit
Pentax really at this show but I got the
P 600's before the show so I was able to
do an overview on that did you see some
real solid case you see the blocks if
they have for the other dominus yeah erm
and for the I saw the blocks for the the
video cards okay they also had like I
don't know if they house therefore they
they had the Dominus actually mounted in
one of the elite the athili because
apparently it's the only case right now
in the market that can fit that
motherboard and they actually so they
said that Intel hits them up for like
hey we need we need help guys or it
might have been issues and so then they
truly ever developed custom blocks for
the BRM the board's vrm is also not yeah
100% yeah yeah yeah x $5.99
unfortunately not a huge traffic or
interest driver I think for the show
absolutely not I can't imagine why it
seems like I said of most people's price
range yeah or just the existence of the
chip to buy at all yes yeah what was the
price do you know what the what the end
price was it's like I heard 4,000 I
heard 8,000
I don't know have you landed for sale
anywhere probably something now middle I
have not found it online
Nicholas if you find it for four grand
are you gonna buy one
yeah I'll buy one I have to beat Jenny
that would probably be a good good
reason investment for that yeah that's
about the only reason it's a good
investment at least for our on our end
is their cut out like if it's eight
thousand still how much how much is
worth how much is watching this right
now they're the how much can we charge
I'm just beating Jay worth to you a gram
how much would you pay to beat Jay it's
really how much I don't know I I feel
like I can push Jay into buying it's
here so I'll help it against the
forehead it didn't kill a killer how
many of those 28 cores we sold to do so
far I know who that went to yeah and
there's nothing or maybe yeah within 30
days yeah just like the the Walmart
system yes but you have returned to
despite its fractured glass
I haven't returned it yet oh really
30-day window so we're gonna do it soon
they were generous enough to allow you
to return it yes very clear that the
entire front panel was basically gone
and the guy just didn't care he's like
look that it looks like Walmart effed up
and they're trying to make right and
which is fine by me okay now that was a
giveaway system so what what's happening
with the winner at the gala but I'm
gonna have a different system that's
either got equal or better specs that's
gonna be going on soon as well that's
not be difficult yeah yeah true
Vega Vega is big any thoughts on Radeon
being a seven yeah the radiant seven so
we were talk a little bit about like
where this card comes from because it's
not Navi and a lot of people were
expecting Navi or something on Navi and
they really didn't say anything the
speculation was that they're taking
instincts GPUs and repurposing them for
Radeon seven which might be an indicator
of why there's 16 gigs of HBM 2 on there
which most people really don't need for
gaming it's way overkill so I think it
makes a lot of sense as a crossover card
between if you're really going to do
some production with it and also game it
also allows AMD to say hey we have a
seven animator card
it's out on the market a big question
when it comes to performance but if it
can really count on my line up at the
2080 it seems like it's relatively
competitive the interesting thing that I
heard is that the the car do you guys
saw at the show the 3:3 fan version that
AMD came out with is the only one that's
gonna exist there's gonna be no
third-party designs for it so draw from
that what you will is yeah and I heard
from sort of board partners that they
just weren't sure so it sounded like
there was still some hope there okay so
maybe maybe in black shirt I don't know
maybe don't wait and see how sales go
there are times where we're in media we
know more than some of the board
partners just because of how information
gets shared which is kind of sad so yeah
if there's no there's no board partner
model very least hopefully custom water
blocks would be nice yeah I'm not gonna
get that's my question was like hey this
looks like a real nice card
are they third-party versions with can
we expect them and the answer was you
shouldn't so now how high up was the
person last reasonably high you know
what they're talking about okay big
company yeah well I mean the the billing
was creator card right like that's kind
of how they built this great device 16
gigabytes HBM - when I last checked
probably bout a year ago 8 gigabytes was
a $150 cost so it's like almost half the
cards cost is just a memory it's very
expensive yeah every probably hasn't
changed much right because I mean how
are you doing right now in HBM - so like
I've heard it's improved a bit but it's
still the problem is like it's a total
package yield so you have a big die and
then you have HBM dies then you have an
interposer yield so you've got yield on
yield on yield like see that makes it
expensive or interpose or something like
25 bucks each or something so
yeah I don't on the creator side billing
like do you guys ever run out of video
memory when you're editing videos or
anything like that
no I did not but my video editor Joe up
and work just after-effects and so
that's a little bit higher level than
most people who are just kind of
chopping together a video right or
something like that but it can eat up
memory like like it loves memory so have
you seen I think what's the highest it's
ever gotten right now well I should
clarify I'm talking about system memory
when right after effects it doesn't use
the GPU memory as much I could maybe see
there's some sort of a you know patch -
they'll be software something taking
advantage of it but that's kind of the
example I have where a actual production
application that heats up memory that's
why he has 128 gigs as far as vram goes
I mean I've seen not really that much
utilization when when editing because it
doesn't really leverage that very much
but especially in gaming I think the
highest I've ever hit was maybe nine or
ten gigs playing GTA 5 or something like
that yeah that 4k and like okay like the
RT X 2018 the RT X cards have like up to
11 gigs right but I think in 2019 we're
gonna see that boundary pushed even
further with upcoming titles Triple A
games and stuff so it is going to be
nice for for those high end gamers at
least to to have that extra Headroom
with the 16 I think and there there may
be a use case I'm sure there is in
machine learning and deep learning for
like a budget class machine learning
guard is it it's pretty cheap for that
amount of memory but I don't think any
of us really cover that spectrum and in
any serious fashion and the other
speculation is that they're taking
instinct chips and that's what they're
repurposing for the Radeon 7 so yeah I
think that's probably accurate but yeah
so I don't know we we've seen video
memory issues sometimes in premiere but
it's only when stacking like multiple
super high resolution images on top of
each other it's kind of hard to trigger
it but it
triggered I guess CBS I'd any thoughts I
didn't see any CPUs at CES this year so
a lot of the x5 99 boards the systems
were completely built and there is no
CPU in the socket so even though even
the vendors putting the system's
together don't have to display don't
even have that they don't they don't
have the 31 75 X several then we spoke
with we're supposed to get one you could
surmise most people with that
motherboard we're supposed to get one
but they were pulled at last second
because they didn't show up in time or
or some other reason for menzel right
that was supposed to launch it end of
2018
I don't yeah it was at that Intel event
right yeah well they from they promised
at Computex that they'd have this 28
core monster consumer chip 5 gigahertz
capable 2018 so it's not I I mean that's
the softest launch I think I've ever
I've ever seen it if like I still
haven't thought anyone who could have
good buy one at retail so yeah the fact
that they existed in demo systems does
not to me equate to launched in 2018
yeah right it's not available yet yeah
did you find any killer robots Paul oh
yeah you know apparently not he still
lives I searched I searched for the
killer robots I think there's a lot of
robots that are capable of lethal force
especially in large numbers for some of
the smaller ones I do have some hope
though because a lot of the companies
developing the robot said our goal is
harmony between the humans and the
robots I don't know if those people were
robots themselves that's a possibility
you always have to keep that in mind
right but you know they've come a long
way so eventually I think we're just
going to have to
give in and accept their their dominance
and control of risk that thought popped
into my head at last booth on I don't
know I can't seem to weird like if the
machines are gonna take over one day
which they inevitably will it's probably
gonna start like right here like it'll
be during CES like yeah it'll probably
be Jensen it's what it'll be
they'll get up onstage and you'll see
this weird mechanical movement he'll
walk out onstage with a product and then
another Jensen to walk out onstage with
yeah that's tonight ended like 2200 gems
yeah
ladies and gentlemen isn't it just the
best isn't it just beautiful
it just works his head will open and
then like a little mini robot Jensen
will walk out like a net in black and
he'll be wearing a tiny leather jacket I
just thought Lisa she was wearing a
leather jacket I actually kind of like
that I feel intentional right it's like
a runway show right now who are you
wearing
oh I'm wearing the Jensen who did it
best yeah I was wondering if it was a
subtle digger comment to make your move
yeah and it does seem we have I didn't
read all the articles with the
interviews after the AMD event but it
does seem like we have pretty much
confirmation that we're gonna get 16
cores on a m4 right and the desktop or
at least yes at least two of the small
quick dies which we assumed they would
ratchet up to 16 core yeah I think
should be 16 should be 12 but I don't
know if that was officially I don't
think that was officially announced but
it seems like why would they position
the chip up in the corner right that's
there's no there's no sensible
explanation for that yeah speaking with
vendors it shouldn't be 12 in 16 are you
gonna be modifying your mod mat for that
special corner die oh yeah hey BMO no no
application
yeah I'm not sure it's so irrelevant
yeah I don't know if they if they starts
we've already had product development
challenges where products change as
we're working on stuff so I now
understand better what the manufacturers
go through especially those who work
with Intel and AMD and NVIDIA
it's like last-minute specs
is but yeah I guess I guess to check out
the killer robot video check Paul's
channel to check out fit winner nitwit
where you can watch three three three
right away with me yeah if lose at a Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire knockoff then
you can check out fit with Kyle's
channel super original you hippie yeah
it's good though it's good it's I think
it's a very fitting series for your
content side yeah nervous you were
nervous I I mean I didn't know what kind
of test I was in for so that were yeah
and then I failed mostly yes both
physically and mentally challenging
nervous anymore after you loves that's
true as a weight that was lifted so
really it was like it's like being born
anew and the light of God that's how I
describe it and then tech Jesus arrived
[Laughter]
all right and on that that very positive
note will end here check their channels
for more will link them in the
description below
I guess Luke is here in spirit of a
cable tie he's been demoted cable tie
handler cable tie Luke swagman swagman
alright thank you guys for joining me
we'll see you all next time
kind of daily weather my god to the left
out I'm in this third take it my face
yes face needs to be right there
and Kyle</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
