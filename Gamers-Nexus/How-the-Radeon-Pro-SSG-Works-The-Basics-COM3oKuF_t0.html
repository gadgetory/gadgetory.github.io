their Radeon Pro SSG or solid-state
graphics we followed up with Andy to
talk about more of the specs on this
device it's we don't have everything but
we've got a good amount now so first of
all I spoke to Andy is Robert Jamison
who gave us a bit more information on
the SSG from Radeon Pro this is not a
gaming card but it is very interesting
to the industry because it may be
something that we see in the future so
SSG solid-state graphics there is
effectively a solid state drive volt
bolted on to the video card that's
what's new here other than that it's the
the same thing that we always know for
GPUs so or for video cards so there's a
card it's PCB goes into a PCIe slot
there's a GPU on it which is by the way
a last generation chip not Polaris the
WX 70 150 140 101 pro cards are the only
Radeon Pro cards from that SIGGRAPH
announcement that are on Polaris this
SSG is on the last generation so that
aside video card goes into a PCIe slot
standard PCB with a GPU standard V RAM
on the card even the only thing that
that's different is this extended frame
buffer so it's a one terabyte extended
frame buffer effectively again an SSD
bolted to the card and that SSD which
AMD is calling an SSG or solid-state
graphics because does function
differently the SSG pulls eight lanes
from the allocated lanes to the card so
if you've got it in a 16 slot then eight
of those lanes will communicate with the
rest of the car the GPU and then the
remaining eight lanes will talk to the
solids a graphics device or power it
anyway so that's the the big thing here
you may be asking if we're taking eight
lanes from the GPU does it sort of
reduce the theoretical maximum bandwidth
that the the card can push and therefore
reduce its performance but because of
the way this system works it actually
comes out as a positive with those eight
lanes being allocated to local on card
storage the extended frame buffer it
uses a NAND flash which we explained in
another video with an animation that you
can see on the screen now it's
effectively again an SSD on the GPU and
that allows production news
to store local large files that are
actively being crunched by the GPU so
whenever the GPU needs a large texture
or big data or composite objects it will
talk to the CPU and the CPU then talks
to system storage or memory or wherever
that data may be located and if that
data happens to be loaded it from the
system's SSD or hard drive or a network
drive you encounter a lot of latency so
the SSD bypasses this by storing local
files for entire projects at one time so
this is something that you kind of use
on a project project basis with the
production or workstation environments
and if we take an example of an
architectural CAD model you might be
marking a city using ray tracing for
example to determine where light will
hit as it interacts with your building
so the example that AMD gave us was in
Europe there are apparently laws that
restrict buildings from blocking light
as it interacts with other buildings so
you can't build something that's just
gonna abstract light for the whole city
and that can be modeled with ray tracing
in these applications and it's pretty
intensive on the GPU so to load massive
CAD models takes a lot of time as the
GPU paint ponds with system storage from
in some cases minutes to an hour and an
SSG means that you can eliminate the
communication over the PCIe bus to the
CPU and then you further eliminate that
communication from the cpu to storage
and then back again to the GPU that is a
lot of physical distance across the
board and products and everything in the
system it's also a lot of latency that
gets cut down I've asked for a specific
number by the way on the latency haven't
gotten one yet but well you know if we
do get one the GPU can now directly
communicate with local storage with that
SSG on there it's up to one terabyte as
I said and that's mostly usable if the
vram capacity on the card has been
exceeded which it probably will be with
these production work cases so and these
rep told us that the card will probably
have four gigabytes of RAM a VRAM rather
but he said it might be more but it is a
one terabyte confirmed on the SSD so
right now today the card is being sold
exclusively as a pre-order with a dev
kit only there's no standalone card
available but there's good reason for
that because you can
do anything with a standalone card just
yet so a dev kit which includes the
let's see includes the card developer
support of course from AMD and their
software team and andy built api to make
the card actually work with software and
documentation that's ten thousand
dollars the card itself will be coming
out separately at some point but this is
what you can get right now for the
workstation users and in terms of using
this card out of box you really can't
right now so the applications have to be
specifically and purpose-built for this
on card storage because it's not a
normal thing so you they have to be
built to accommodate that and make sure
it's actually being leveraged to its
fullest potential and andy has told us
that they're working with ISPs already
to build existing applications to
support an SSG so good news on that
front and then the rest of it basically
if you are one of these people you would
use the dev kits to sort of build your
internal or other applications to
support an SSG and once all that
software is built the GPU can basically
dump geometry textures composite objects
shaders all these models onto the SSG
rather than onto vram and then purge
that over and over and over again or
painting the SSD on the system and that
helps with real time scrubbing and
camera angle modifications for
animations where you're not sure of
where you want the camera angle to be
but you don't want to render it out at
super low resolutions just to play
around this bypasses that AMD scrubbed
8k video from at 90 plus FPS from 17 fps
previously without the SSD so that was
their demo at SIGGRAPH anyway we'll see
how it works out there in the real world
speeds we're looking at a 3 to 4x gain /
system storage in terms of operating
speed with this card for large models
but a lot more info closer to
availability which will be in 2017
probably pretty early that's all for
this as always pitch online commercial
