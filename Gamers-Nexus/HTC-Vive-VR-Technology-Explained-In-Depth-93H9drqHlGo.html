dotnet and i'm joined by patrick stone
our hardware editor and we're talking
about HTC's vibe which is also known as
valves VR solution and it is a product
made by HTC HTC manufactured design and
valve has contributed their own input
and demands including latency demands
and software support and they've also
assisted in the development of the White
House which is the accompanying laser or
I or is it ir or laser now it's it is IR
laser okay so it shoots down beams there
you go to corners of the room and it
basically scans the room checks for
presence of objects walls and the user
and then in the headset which is all
virtual reality so you're not actually
seeing the room it draws at least when I
used it draws up walls when you approach
the real walls to let you know that you
should probably stop going that way yeah
it's called their chaperone system
that's the name they've given it and it
just you know helps you not to run into
walls right which is important so we saw
at GDC and we were not allowed to film
at that time but we've got some film
this time and the experience is a little
different so I tried it at GDC Patrick
try to hear yep and had a couple
different games the basic specs of the
HTC vive are it's got a 20 160 x 1200 mm
display resolution and that's using two
displays at what was it 1080 x 1200 yeah
right it's a 1080 x 1200 resolution for
the two separate displays one for each I
their lenses in there just like oculus
and all the other VR solutions have
there
in technology and it's got a couple of
different inputs and outputs so you've
got three plugs that matter USB 3 for
the data transmission to and from the pc
HDMI for audio video yep and then the
third was how are you got a half hour
and then there is an audio jack as well
yeah so that's accompanied by two
controllers which I don't know a whole
lot about because chains I think since I
saw them okay so what's what's up with
the controller's right now what are they
so with the controllers they're
basically I guess you'd call them want
more than anything and they have
photodiodes on them to interact with the
base stations the house space stations
and in addition to that they actually
communicate with the pc software and
they do that through little radio
frequency wireless transmitters and
those radio frequency wireless
transmitters are actually connected to
radio frequency wireless transmitters
that are plugged in currently two USB
dongles that plug-in on the headset the
engineer that we were working with a guy
named Levi was saying yeah it's probably
not going to be that way in the final
product you won't have a little USB
dongles hanging from your head but
that's how it's working and so it gives
the general idea of how the
communication system works right and the
pipeline is basically it shifts the
signal from the system from the pc that
goes down your audio video USB all that
that we just discussed and then it's
eventually output to the displays and at
that point you've got obviously latency
concerns which is a big issue that
oculus has had to tackle over the last
few years so the latency did they ever
give us a number on with the no they
didn't give us a number but just from
user experience I mean it was it was
good stuff really was it's fairly
responsive when I tried at GDC I felt
like for traditional gaming purposes
like
an FPS for example you probably would
not want to use this yeah because it
didn't seem like it was accurate enough
and not not quite that responsive right
but for new experiences like there was a
painting program when we go in there and
he can paint stuff in three dimensions
really cool what were what was the you
had a plain one or something yeah so I
got to play a game where basically you
had airplanes that were flying around
you had to literally walk through the
land and grab the airplanes and when you
grab the airplanes you then directed
them how to land and you had a couple of
features like that where the interaction
was was me grabbing something and then
slowly got to get in somewhere so it
wasn't like super rapid movement and I
guess even just open space kind of stuff
where there was just one sim where it
was just kind of getting you familiar
with the space and you were underwater
and I think you got to do this one of
the whale yeah a whale and it's actually
from what i remember it gets up pretty
close to you yes i'm like a sunken
chippers yeah yes I was like yeah like a
sunken ship you can go up to the railing
which in my demo was where around where
the wall was and you can't really go
past that physically anyway and that the
death was very good very good there's
multiple layers of depth and you can
definitely see the whale approaching her
but but again no like super fast
reaction needed so this is the kind of
thing we're seeing right now so that
there probably are some latency things
are still there still working out but to
to that that regard again I didn't feel
like as I was moving around and
interacting with the controllers that it
was like click wait for something to
happen and then move it was pretty much
click happen but if you're playing the
first person shooter where split seconds
of shooting counts then I could see a
problem with that
and what was the the dota demo is
probably relevant yeah people like dota
so you guys might be promoted the
shopkeeper right and so they actually
got you to go into the shopkeepers place
and you got to interact with a lot of
objects there and my personal favorite
there was a little dragon sitting in the
corner and he had like a fish in his
mouth and he would just kind of hop
around and you could just poke at him he
would hop around and back up but the man
talked about wanting to go into a game
and like be fully immersed in a game
that was the experience that was going
on here so pretty impressive from from
my point of view at this later stage of
development I think the technology is
very impressive the use cases and
implementations are going to be a
challenge I talked about this in the
first article where you basically
require either an empty room or a large
space you can dedicate to this yeah it's
not something everyone can have if
you're like cramped in an apartment
already or something good pulling
because you do need space for the White
House is to be in the corners of the
room and to not trip over stuff not at
all because this is a fully you see
nothing of the outside yep so
technologically I I know that the the
refresh rate is 90 hurts yep on the two
screens and you spoke to leave I was it
yeah so you heard a lot more about the
tech than I did what's what stuff that
people should know um so the the text
pretty cool in that one of the things
they did that allows them to push these
high-resolution images at high refresh
rates is that you know that they are
using HDMI and that allows the data to
come across quickly so there is this the
the idea that you're walking around with
a cord tagged onto the back of your head
and I think it's going to stay that way
in the early development the levi and us
also talked about the possibility of
wireless in the future and he said don't
count on it but don't count it out
either so looking at some of the other
parts so we've already talked about the
hdmi we've already talked about the
power we already talked about the USB
and we've talked about
controllers and how the controllers are
linked wirelessly via USB dongles but we
haven't gone into a lot of detail is the
sound and we have to talked about a
pretty cool concept currently what they
want to do with sound is they want to
have the hdmi deliver the audio to the
headset and then on the headset as a 3.5
millimeter stereo jack you plug it in
about right there and then you can use a
nice set of you know no headphones yeah
real headphones right some some gaming
headphones and you put them on and then
again you're immersed but another idea
would be to use a fully configured
surround sound system and the advantage
of doing something like that would be
that you could still hear outside real
world sounds like so if somebody was in
need of your help and you need to quit
playing a game you can actually hear
that whereas with headphones on you may
not hear that is a legitimate use case
concerning easily yeah so we've talked
about how the information is over to the
system Houston delivers it to you but
how does this know where you are right
so we talked about not running into
walls yeah systems got to know where the
wall farm so this was where the
lighthouse base stations come in the
lighthouse base stations are infrared
laser true I guess you could call them
transmitters and they kind of shoot a
beam pattern down the floor and it goes
left and right on a rotor and it goes up
and down the rotor and so you've got one
from one corner and then one from the
opposing corner and the reason they did
that he explained this to me was that
let's say you you turn around and then
all of the photodiodes that are on the
headset and that are on the controllers
if you turn around let's say your backs
your back spacing me and you got one of
your lighthouse pay stations shooting
this way they can't seem to the
photodiodes so that's why the other ones
it's employed yeah you got it and so it
it uses these base stations in the way
Levi expand it was like a GPS like
approach the base stations don't talk to
the system and in any way all they do is
they just project lasers and so like in
gps we don't ever talk to the satellites
but the satellites do send signals down
and so
it's a it's a system that allows the
headset to keep up with where it is
based on these lasers right so it you
know with these lighthouse base stations
one of the cool things is that we were
told that if you wanted to make a bigger
room or a hallway you could do that you
could just add lighthouse way stations
and then you can theoretically just keep
piling them out so it's like tile tile
tile tile and you just keep getting
bigger well the problem with that the
limitations that we have right now is
you'd have to have like a really long
hdmi cord really long power cord a
really long USB cord and some of you
guys might say not only goes so far yeah
you get signal degradation exactly right
and then then some people were like whoa
let's just do it all wirelessly and the
problems wireless is bandwidth right now
we currently don't have the bandwidth to
send a really nice high definition video
signal over wireless so some people have
been like hey well let's just strap a PC
to our back then yeah well then you got
battery issues too so but hey there's
engineers people like fun stuff maybe
it'll get developed in here right so
speaking out development the original
target I was told as 2015 yeah it sounds
like that's only an initial run now and
then the rest is 2016 yep that's the
middle so that's let's compete with
oculus and some other solutions but that
is what the target date looks like I was
not told the price for you know didn't
get any prices yet so no price yet it's
still kind of nebulous there but we will
keep everyone updated via the website
gamers Nexus net and of course check
back on the YouTube channel and if you
like this kind of content if you like
the technical detail then do check out
our patreon page which is in the post
roll video we linked there so that
that's all for the HTC vive hit the
length of description below for the full
article although
other technical stuff we didn't get into
here and we will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
