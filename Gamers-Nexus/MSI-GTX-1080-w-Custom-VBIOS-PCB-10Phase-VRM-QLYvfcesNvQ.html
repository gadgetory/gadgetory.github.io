our trip and we're looking at some of
the new msi products including the new
GT X 1080 with the twin rows or six
cooler so this is a bit different than
the founders Edition that we reviewed
previously and the main differences are
going to be for power and thermals and
that's relevant for all the overclocking
so we talked pretty heavily about
overclocking when we did our GT X 1080
hybrid mod as you all saw and this will
resolve some of those thermal issues so
the main thing to look at is the twin
froze or six cooler so it's got a double
ball bearing fan design with a torx 2.0
fan and this is a updated version of the
torques fan that Emma size used on
previous twin Fraser models the main
update is there are two types of fan
blades one is a dispersion fan blade and
one is a traditional fan blade so the
dispersion fan will help generate a
turbulence that the traditional fan can
force through the heatsink and cool down
the GPU itself the GPU itself should run
about 20% cooler we haven't tested this
ourselves but we will soon should be
about 20% cooler that will help with
some of the thermal Headroom issues
where we were hitting 82 Celsius on our
overclocks
and causing really crazy spikes on the
frequency so in theory that helps with
that with regard to overclocking
specifically the things that I'm most
interested in are of course there's an
extra power header you may have already
seen that is an extra six pin so there's
an eight pin and a six pin the total
power allowance is now upwards of 300
watts the extra six pin about a 75 watt
add there but you start running into the
BIOS and voltage limitations on your
overclock as we saw with a 1080 hybrid
mod so to get around that there is a
custom v bios on this we don't know a
whole lot about it yet it should have
some extra millivolt milli volts for the
over voltage when you're doing your
profiles but we don't know how much so
hopefully it'll push beyond the 10 61
millivolt limit that we were running
into on the founders edition if it even
pushes the 1080 or a little higher 1100
that should be enough to get a good
maybe hundred megahertz extra clock if
it is actually unlocked in that regard
so that's a big thing
power phase is another big thing the VRM
is now at n + 1 phase v RM and that's
against the 5 + 1 phase on the founders
Edition card pretty massive difference
there in terms of voltage cleanliness so
to speak outside of the power phasing
the PCB itself is custom so this is not
a reference piece
B or founders Edition PCB is a custom
PCB and it's a ten layer one which
doesn't give some extra stability and
overclock in performance then the
reference design there's a backplate of
course for your structural integrity but
that pretty much wraps up most of the
new Twin Frozr models you'll find
additional information linked in our
article in the description below and
yeah stay tuned for the Computex
coverage will have some x99 motherboard
stuff coming up shortly and then other
AIB partner video cards as well for the
1080 and maybe the 1070 so as always
thank you for watching subscribe to
watch more or if you just want to see me
sweat over here in Taipei because it's
crazy hot but I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
