be taking a look at another GT x 1080
PCB this time the gigabyte extreme water
force card
this also shares its PCB with the
extreme gaming which is the air-cooled
version of this same card if you would
like to see the rueful review over the
card you can find a link to that in the
description down below and with that out
of the way let's get to actually taking
a look at this PCB first things first we
have the core voltage vrm right here and
that provides power to the GPU core down
here we have the 1 volt PLL voltage this
is a extra voltage that is required to
make the GPU core work but it's not
really an important vrm it's very
low-power it doesn't have any impact on
overclocking and it you know isn't
impacted you know by overclocking in any
in any way either and so it doesn't
really matter and you know we're not
gonna actually cover that one in detail
over here we have the memory vrm that
provides power to the gddr5 X chips
surrounding the GPU core and in this
area somewhere there is the 1.8 volt
rail which also goes to the gddr5 X
chips and basically it's again a
low-power vrm and it's basically just
necessary for the gddr5 X chips to work
they take the bulk of their power from
this VR I'm over there so with all of
the v arms identified let's actually
take a closer look at what they're made
up of first of all the core voltage is a
12 phase VRM we have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10 11 12 inductors or chokes whichever
you prefer to call them and each of
these has its own
dr. Moss power module so each of these
has you know a power module
unfortunately the thermal pads cover
some of them but you know if those
weren't there you could see that there's
actually 12 of these so this is a real
real 12 phase design
these dr. Moss power modules these are
FDM f68 23 seized from Fairchild
Semiconductor these are rated to do 50
amps at 300 kilohertz or 45 amps at 1
megahertz so you know they're plenty
powerful and with you know this 12 phase
vrm and one of these per phase you get
around 540 to 600 amps of current
capability through this vrm here
obviously if you've watched my previous
a previous PCB breakdowns you would know
that the that getting a face count above
eight phases requires some extra extra
circuitry and this being a 12 phase it
needs to use doublers or at least
doublers or quadruple errs to actually
achieve the 12 phase twelve phases so
this is done by these three ICS on the
PCB these are u P 1911 ours each of them
takes in a pwm signal from the u p9 v 11
located over here so this is the V RM
control chip so that monitors the vrm
output voltage power draw and everything
for this here v RM and it feeds each of
these 1911 or piet 1911 our chips a PWM
signal and also monitors the current
readings that are coming out of those
and those then take that PWM signal and
feed it into four four of the four of
the dr. most modules located in the the
RM itself now these chips do have a
downside they cut your switching
frequency to 1/4 of what you're feeding
them so essentially it means that you
have less accurate control over each of
the phases
however gigabyte can actually get around
this you know downside of using these
chips by using a really high switching
frequency from the 9
95 11 and the 95 11 can provide up to 2
megahertz switching frequency so you
know that's basically 2 million
updates for you know you know most fad
like phase updates per second and
basically when though that goes to the
or drew blur that means each phase can
be updated as many as five hundred
thousand times a second so it can adjust
the current through that phase that many
times each second that means that as
long as gigabyte uses a reasonable
switching frequency on the you know the
you p95 11 the erm actually runs you
know actually relatively clean power on
par with basically any other GT X 1080
because 200 to 500 kilohertz switching
frequency is the usual vrm switching
frequency that you'll see on most
graphics cards and really going above
that is generally completely unnecessary
unless you're doing extreme overclocking
or something like that and even in those
cases it often doesn't really help
anything because most V RMS can get away
with can actually do very very clean
power at you know 200 or 500 kilohertz
already so really running super high
frequencies isn't a requirement so the
fact that gigabytes using these
quadruple errs isn't isn't a major
downside however it is still interesting
that they use quadruple errs and I'm
pretty sure that you know and this the
reason for that is that quadruple errs
are relatively expensive and they don't
like it doesn't really make sense to use
them in many situations like this where
you could have just used six PWM signals
from the from the control chip and then
use doublers to actually get your twelve
phases however I do believe gigabyte
opposite for the quadruple errs because
this card has display outputs all the
way over here
as well as over here and the way these
guys work is that there's the
these switches over here so you have
display so normally your display signal
goes to the back of the card but if you
would like to the card will put the
signal to the towards the back and then
this switch will actually send it around
to the other end of the card and this is
for VR so that you can hook up a VR
output to the front panel of your you
know of your tower and basically by
doing this there's a lot of extra traces
that have to go through the PCB and that
means there's a lot less available space
to route traces for the 12 phase vrm
which would normally require a pretty
significant amount of phases traces
coming off of the control chip located
right there
so gigabyte obviously seems to have
opposite for the quadruple errs to
minimize the amount of traces coming
directly off of the off of the up9 95 11
and tried to spread them out between the
quadrupolar chips around the card
so overall the core voltage vrm is
perfectly fine ridiculously overkill for
a GTX 1080 as I said before something
around you know between 540 and 600 amps
depending on how switching frequency you
go by opted to feed into the quadruple
errs and the reason for this partially
is because this vrm in this in the water
force card there is no air flow in this
area because there's no fan and there's
actually no airflow anywhere on the PCB
of the card so all of the cooling of the
card is has to be taken care of by just
you know a passive airflow from your
case fans or from the fact that hot air
rises and everything and then the the
bulk of the heat of the card is then
taken care of by an a i/o cooler sitting
over the GPU core right here and that a
i/o cooler has a copper plate that
covers all the gddr5 X chips so those
are well cooled and then there's a heat
pipe coming off of an aluminum block
that you know is in contact with the
core voltage v RM right
and that then pipes heat into the copper
copper plate that the AIO cooler uses to
actually also cool the gddr5 X chips so
that's how gigabyte basically cools the
vrm but because this isn't a
particularly efficient way to cool of
erm it does mean that they've probably
you know did this ridiculous amount of
over spec on the v RM partially to
compensate for the fact that the vrm
temperatures are going to be less than
you know less than optimal they're
really gonna be quite up there because
that one heat pipe having to take all of
this heat is through an aluminum block
and through several like the thing is
like when you're bonding heat sinks
together you know you have aluminum
block solder copper heat pipe solder
copper copper cold plate for the water
block and that's just a lot of different
materials for the heat to transition
through and that really impedes heat
transfer performance and that means this
vrm even with the heat pipe will be
running pretty pretty toasty so the
ridiculous overkill rating here that's
at 25 degrees ambient which is basically
assuming that the MOSFETs are you know
capable of being cooled by the hot air
rises air flow whereas here in a case
the card will most likely be upside down
so that's really not going to work that
great so the aluminum block is there to
you know make sure that the ERM get gets
at least some active cooling but even
then it's it's less than optimal so I
think this ridiculous car like current
capability is just basically
compensating for the fact that the vrm
is gonna run really really halt because
there's really no reason why you would
need this on a GTX 1080 it won't really
help overclocking performance because
the card will never ever need this much
current but it is you know nice that
this vrm is so ridiculously over built
because you basically have peace of mind
that there is no way you're ever going
to have this fail on you
assuming that there isn't some
manufacturing defect in it so props to
gigabyte on the core voltage vrm so
let's move over to the other major vrm
on this card and that's the memory
voltage VR M right here so that feeds
the gddr5 X chips this is a two-phase
vrm we have - chokes here it's
controlled by the U P 1665 this is a two
phase voltage controller with integrated
drivers so basically there's no driver
ICS anywhere you know around this area
because this can actually drive the
MOSFETs directly and speaking of the
MOSFETs
these are fairchild power trench power
stages so these are not regular MOSFETs
these are a high side fat and a low side
FET integrated into one IC so each of
these is actually enough to make up and
so you know a single phase and there's
two of them in each phase because
gigabyte wanted even more current
capability so they put two of them in
parallel to get more current throughput
the end result of this is that each of
these has a 13 amp high side and that's
a continuous rating so obviously in AVR
and you can expect it to do quite a bit
more than that and that's a 25 degree
ambient rating so you know the passively
cooled no heatsink no air and no proper
airflow other than other than just
convection so that you know that rating
is most relevant here because there is
no active airflow over this this part of
the vrm and it's gonna be running pretty
halt just because of that so I'm gonna
go with that rating but still the
continuous rating is still very very
conservative because the high side
MOSFET is basically we can turn on and
off hundreds of thousands of times a
second it doesn't stay on continuously
so you can actually expect it to do
quite a bit more than the 13 amps
continuous rating even in this terribly
cold scenario that it's in the high the
low side FET is 23 amps continuous and
that rating is actually realistically
what it will actually
be able to handle in this application
because the low-side fat is turned on
for most most of the time when in a drm
so that one test spends a lot of its
time turned on so you know we have 13
amps well not even 13 so let's say you
know 15 or 16 amps / / I see in each
phase so that gives us about 30 amps /
for each given phase two phases total
you have 60 amps you know if you don't
go by the absolute worst-case scenario
and if you go by worst case possible
scenario then it's 52 amps because
that's the high side MOSFETs continuous
rating for no proper cooling scenarios
and this is again ridiculously overkill
the gddr5 X on a 1080 poles around 30
watts which with the voltage it runs
that works out to around 22 amps so you
know we have a we have a 52 M a memory
vrm here so gigabyte went ridiculously
overkill and i suspect it's again
because there's no proper air flow in
this area due to the lack of the fan so
yeah does mean that if you actually
tried to get some airflow into the
shroud of the card this the RM is just
going to be amazing like it perform
amazingly and in its stock configuration
it's also perfectly good because
gigabyte really did go insanely overkill
on everything just to make sure that it
can function in the less than optimal
cooling environment that they've decided
to go with on the water force whereas
the gaming extreme the all know the
extreme gaming so that's the air-cooled
version of this card that one would
actually have a heatsink here with
proper airflow over the entire of erm
section so that one would actually
arguably probably be a you know I have
better erm capabilities not that it
really matters because this isn't gtx
1080 and even in these less than sub you
know in these completely sub optimal
cooling scenarios the VR i'm set up that
gigabyte has opted for
he's so ridiculously overkill that it
really doesn't matter they're like
you're not gonna see a GTX 1080 use
anywhere near the whole capacity of this
vrm I'll be surprised like not even 50%
of the capacity of this vrm will ever
really be used so yeah they're very nice
very nice PCB from gigabyte here and
props to them for designing such a
ridiculous monstrosity if you think
about it so that's that for the PCB
