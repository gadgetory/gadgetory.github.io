know a lot of you are waiting for the
Vega hybrid results they're almost done
as of shooting this video
those will hopefully go up tomorrow but
for now we are tearing down a 1080 TI
lightning this is the new msi card we
saw it at Computex it's an overclocking
targeted card so it would be in the same
class as the King 10 card where you
really only buy this type of thing if
you're actually going to be serious
about trying to overclock it otherwise
you might as well get something that's a
bit lighter weight and this speaking of
weight is quite large it is I believe it
in direct competition with these O's hat
card we just reviewed if not a little
bit larger it has one of the biggest
heat sinks we've seen on a card it's got
a heat pipe on the back and then
hopefully some cool overclocking
features which we'll get to as we tear
the thing down before that that coverage
is brought to you by the core g21
enclosure from thermal take a $70 case
with two four millimeters thick tempered
glass side panels mesh ventilation in
the front for breathability a rarity in
cases these days and a power supply
shroud with top mounted SSD sled learn
more at the link in the description
below so to refresh everyone on the card
first a quick walk around it has three
eight pin connectors which are probably
unnecessary but we'll talk about that
more in the review and then for the rest
of it it has a few familiar features so
the base plate which is this black plate
right here is similar in some ways to
the EVGA IC X cards where it has those
EVGA calls them pin fins or in other
words small cylindrical fins sticking up
from the base plate made of aluminum
it's got some of those on it so the MSI
Lightning is one of the first MSI cards
to adopt a more complex base plate and
just looking down the side here I can
already see it's got some ventilation
grilling in the base plate so that's new
and interesting as we tear through it
and then it also I believe not a hundred
percent sure on this but I believe it
has some sensors on there some NTC s so
we'll figure that out as we go otherwise
three fan cooler large aluminum heatsink
it's two and a half slots nearly three
and we'll take apart the rest to figure
that out so starting off with the
backside I haven't taken this apart yet
we're going to learn it together
normally I just start with removing the
cooler which is held on as it always is
and because this card is so large I'm
guessing we're also going to have to
unscrew the other things in the back
plate after we get through this warranty
void sticker why a warranty void sticker
on an overclocking card you ask I have
no idea so once we get this pin off as
it loose yet it's probably not loose yet
now ok so that's it for this teardown I
guess we can't get in
right there so there's our stopper the
screws on the backside that are holding
the backplate n are actually going
straight into the baseplate you can see
it sticking up there so we're going to
remove those screws as well yeah I mean
you can you can see how far these things
go through that is a large screw for a
video card okay there's the backplate I
feel thermal pads and also a cable get
that really quickly okay
here's what we've got so far there's
copper heat pipe which looks like a six
mil it's a six mile copper heat pipe or
something like that anyway running clear
across the backside this will be pretty
interesting to test and really won't be
that hard for us to test so we will do
a/b testing on this I'm really genuinely
curious about if that does anything not
just on the lightning but in general
because it's an interesting idea and
because it is a copper heat pipe you'd
think it has a bit more cooling
potential than all the other stuff we've
encountered for back plates like the
tiny copper plate that gigabyte uses and
also heat pipes tend to they're not very
good at spiky heat loads they don't
really have the the ability to deal with
that kind of instant load but they're
good at sustained loads at a fairly
constant heat output so we'll give that
a test that's the backlight though right
here is part of the digital RGB LEDs you
can see that this plate is a different
material that's because it is in fact
part of this
so there's your RGB LEDs these are just
dampers to probably space the back plate
off the board and potentially provide
some vibration damping the standoffs
really do all of the space and off the
board that you'll need
to prevent contact so these aren't fully
necessary but if they want them for
vibration damping that's another story
and we'll figure that out as we go for
the back lick card two thermal pads on
the backside of the GPU and we've got
some caps back here some stray caps and
then just the connector for the RGB LEDs
alright let's separate the rest of this
so this loose yet sort of maybe now one
more screw there missed that one and
we've got what going on alright these
two screws are holding the base plate to
the cooler so we're going to take those
out all right cool let's put this aside
for a second so here's the card with the
base plate we'll get to the rest of the
other cooler part in a moment that's
pretty straightforward though throat
pads and on pads thermal pads those are
on inductors aka chokes and on caps
right here this is partly for thermal
transfer it may also help reduce coil
wine by damping vibration and that's far
better done with the thermal pad than
another interface then we've got here a
heat pipe which is also kind of
reminiscent of EVGA new icx design so
the heat pipe is routed over the MOSFETs
which we haven't yet gotten to and next
to that are these small thin stack
protrusions so service area surface area
here service area here that seems to be
the theme of this card along with
thermal transfer into the giant heatsink
and then over here we have these fins
now because this isn't really that
visible part of the card I would imagine
this is for more than just looks it
probably does help actually ventilate
the underside a little bit it wouldn't
be hard to test I suppose you cover it
up if it is in fact for airflow but
covering it up you obviously can't do
that with the same type of metal as this
we've got some kind of tape here which
let's figure out what that is let's
remove this
all right so as always missing one and
that's just because a 1080i but all
right so this is the base plate heat
pipe all that stuff I just showed you
got thrown pad contact going to the is
actually really cool you can see the
name imprinted on the thermal patch
that's pretty neat dip switch over here
Allen to switch is actually labeled so
original is going to be your base BIOS
and then that one is a special Ln two
BIOS I'm not sure what changes that
makes right now we'll figure it out it
may be a case that they've modded it to
actually have some tuning on it or it
can just be an extra BIOS that you get
to tune yourself that's three that's
actually pretty stuck down pretty well
okay so 14 phase it's doubled we've got
doublers right one two three four five
six seven we have seven pairs of two
MOSFETs
so two by seven is going to give us
fourteen phases which is a doubled setup
and for the components they are using IR
which is the most common right now what
IR is it 35 55 I think is what that is
so the 35 55 power stages international
rectifier more phases over here so this
is your memory vrm right here so we've
got another set of it looks like three
phases right there for probably V mem
ass level feature vram components
voltage controller is an IR 3 5 9 5 a
which i think is what we discussed with
them at Computex so 35 70 be over here
and this whatever I said that was 3 5 9
5 a is your shunt 1 2 3 shots right
there I don't see a switch on here like
on the kingpin card to toggle off any of
the voltage or other limitations but you
could hard mod it if you really wanted
to then what do we have here voltage so
these are voltage 10 outs
these three here is a fan of the fan and
then these are voltage pin outs and one
of them is PLL and then mem is number
two and then GPU is number three so you
get a direct read on voltage with a DMM
those are be checkpoints
I was crazy interesting right now is
that alright so we've seen that let's
look at the cooler three pen setup the
fans are routed through the sides as
you'd expect we've got all three fan
hunters go straight at the board I
believe they are synchronously
controlled but I'm not positive and then
for the rest we have what looked to be
this is an 8 ml heat pipe I think and
actually let's just measure these can
you go me there yeah 10 mil for the
large one and then these others are
going to be what four maybe six these
are six through here through the cold
plate which is a nickel plated copper
cold plate into the larger section of
the heatsink and then out the far side
over here and then we've got another
large heat pipe routed that way where
the small ones go
this smaller six mil is going through
the cold plate and then into the GPU
side exhausting it or exiting over here
I should say and then the others are all
feeding in to this side and then your
GPU memory
cooling is largely being handled by
conduction through the base plate and
then eventually into the larger heatsink
so pretty straightforward layout the
main thing here is just that this is
very large I mean just what's actually
out of curiosity let's go ahead and just
measure this to 26 millimeters it's like
a full inch plus that's pretty large so
one of the biggest heat sinks we've seen
it's got some interesting features we'll
go ahead and do some AV testing with the
back plate especially I'm I'm very
interested in the back plate for a V
test with that copper heat pipe on it
and then the rest of the stuff will go
through normal testing and see how it
performs this and always have this about
the EVGA hybrid and then we have that
ZOTAC card coming from a reader on loan
so your
do that but I'll say it again here this
is probably one of the last 10 agh for
reviewing for the cycle we'll see though
I have requested a kingdon and I do want
to do some kind of LM to work with it
if it comes through we'll look at that
one too but we're really we're getting
towards the end of the ten aut is in
terms of I mean there's not a lot more
to look at other than variance what
we've already looked at that said
there's still some really cool stuff to
benchmark here particularly in the
thermal department again like with this
or was potentially closing off some of
the ventilation ports to see if they
actually do anything in terms of airflow
but otherwise check back for the full
review our Andy Vega hybrid coverage
