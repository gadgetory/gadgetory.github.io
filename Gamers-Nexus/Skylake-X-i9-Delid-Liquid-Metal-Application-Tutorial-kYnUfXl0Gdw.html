short tutorial on how to use the deal it
demodex to deal it the intel skylake X
CPUs this is a tool made by dear Bauer
the extreme overclocker and we use this
tool to deal it the 7900 x7 960 X and 79
80 X e so it will work on all of those
as long as there's guy like X before
getting to that this video is brought to
you by synergy the software that lets
you share a keyboard and mouse between
multiple systems if you have limited
desk space and multiple computers to
command synergy removes the need for a
separate peripherals or a KVM and where
it says over the network software use
our link below to get 50% off the home
or pro version with ssl this tool
specifically must be used for these
there are competing options we haven't
tried them but the tool by their Bauer
needs to be the dealer dime 8x you can't
use the other deal it died mates he's
made because they're for different size
CPUs so this one's pretty simple it
comes with a tool that's used it's just
an allen key and use that to tighten
things down it's also got a clamp and as
we learn from their Bauer later after
the first round the clamp is used to
apply vertical pressure for resealing
the CPU it is not used for deleting the
CPU and then once you've gotten through
all the deleting process you need a plan
of action and that's going to include
cleaning off the silicon adhesive
potentially resealing it potentially
applying liquid metal or other Tim
things like that so you don't have to
specifically apply liquid metal once
you've gone through this process you
could apply a better thermal paste as
well or just replace it you can even
shorten the height of the IHS distance
from the die by cutting off some of the
silicone adhesive all of those things
would improve your thermals one final
disclaimer here I've done this now for
four of these skylake X CPUs that's all
of them that I have so I'm not the most
experienced person in the world at it
I've got some experience with it I've
definitely learned the hard way with the
first one and figured things out and
everything was good at the end of the
day but just keep in mind that this is
advice from the viewpoint of someone who
has done this very recently on for CPUs
but doesn't have any
closely experienced someone like their
Bower might so everything just followed
carefully and keep in mind that this is
really just an intermediate viewpoint so
starting that with the deal at Diamond X
you place the CPU into the CPU tray with
the arrow aligned in the tray with the
arrow on the CPU corner make sure those
line up it's very important that you
follow these instructions carefully
because it's possible that you could
damage the CPU insofar as chipping off
like capacitor or resistor or something
like that some damage isn't going to
kill it some of it will everything you
do here is at your own risk
we will do our best to provide a
tutorial on how to use this tool but
ultimately it's always possible that
even using the tool something could get
damaged and you may end up breaking a
1000 or $2,000 CPU that's entirely on
you so make sure you are well aware of
the risks before you embark on this so
that's dated you place the CPU into the
tray as mentioned align the arrow with
the arrow and the IHS should be facing
up on the underside of it if you look
through the bottom you'll actually see a
cut out where the underside CPU
components the SMDs will show through so
that should be the substrate side on the
bottom with IHS on the top once that's
secured make sure it's not moving around
make sure the corners are aligned
properly and your Allen screws backed
all the way out you can start tightening
it down if you just kind of move the
lever you'll see that the Smasher will
call it the actual piece of metal that
does that applies the force to the IHS
directly that moves as you tighten the
screw not a lot of tightening is needed
here so you kind of just you can spin it
by hand at first once you start facing
resistance use the tool for a couple of
turns do not apply too much force here
we would recommend keeping an eye on the
RFID chip in the corner of the CPU as a
marker for when the IHS moves so watch
that carefully once the distance between
the RFID chip and the IHS changes you'll
see the IHS kind of move maybe
half a millimeter maybe one millimeter
once you see that movement stop
immediately back the screw out you've at
this point broken the seal of the
adhesive between the IHS and the
substrate so now it's time to back
everything out remove the cpu from the
tray and just apply some careful force
not rotational force and not pulling
like to the sides not lateral force you
want this to be a vertical pull upward
using what we'll call the handles of the
IHS from the substrate so that's
important do not apply any sort of
lateral like side-to-side or rotational
force on this because you will chip a
capacitor off of the substrate or a
resistor or damage it in a way that
means it may never boot again so be very
careful
apply some upward force look at the side
of it you should see some separation
between the IHS and the substrate and
that means that you're good to pull it
apart now if you feel like you're
applying too much force just like any
other tool in life then stop take a
careful look at it and you may need to
place it back in for a little bit more
pressure from the D litter but if things
are starting to move around then just
apply some pulling force by hand do not
use a tool do not stick anything under
in between the IHS and the substrate use
your hands only and remove the thing and
that will be the D letting process so
once this is done at this point you can
either apply well first of all clean off
the thermal paste so get just some
alcohol rubbing alcohol and ideally a
q-tip and clean off the thermal paste
from both the IHS and the CPU die and
when you're doing this be careful if you
use a paper towel do not use your
fingernails near anywhere close to the
SM DS because again they're really
fragile it's exceptionally easy to pull
one off with a fingernail if you're not
careful so once that's cleaned off the
next thing to do look over the substrate
make sure all the components look like
they are where they're supposed to be if
you are going to be resealing this
would recommend cleaning off the
silicone adhesive at least from the IHS
because you can leave the the silicone
adhesive on the substrate as a guide if
you'd like and that's actually what we
did in our deleting task so you can
still get exceptionally good thermals
even with leaving that adhesive on the
substrate but definitely remove it from
the IHS and you can do that by using
just a small razor or we even used an
expansion cover from a case to just kind
of scrape it off it is copper under
there so if you start seeing copper
exposed that means you're pushing a
little too hard
so scrape off the adhesive clean off the
thermal paste and take careful note of
how the IHS aligns on the substrate for
when you're done and you want to put it
back on there we use the RFID chip as a
reference point you'll notice that the
IHS has a small indent near the RFID
chip so you can keep that in mind for
aligning them later
speaking with their Bower removing the
silicone adhesive from the substrate
didn't really provide that much of a
difference he has seen 1 2 3 degrees
Celsius improvement over the process
that I've just explained when using
liquid metal so it's certainly not
necessary but you could do it if you
wanted to just be more careful because
there are small components around it and
a knife near those things could be bad
so we're gonna leave it on there as a
guide and take that he's up off the IHS
with that done now it's time to either
apply your Tim or liquid metal you will
want to apply a very thin layer on the
die and on the IHS of both for either
material and when you're doing this now
normally we just do kind of a blob on
the top of IHS to connect with the cold
blade but here we would recommend to
spreading it carefully and more evenly
over the die with a finger a credit card
or a spudger of some kind so that you
can make sure there's even coverage of
the die it's very important there are no
hot spots here so you'll want to do this
manually and this is an instance where
too much is too much or too little are
both detrimental too much means that
you're creating a bigger layer between
the IHS and the die and you'll have
worse performance to little means that
you could without Eve
knowing it have a hotspot corner that
will burn out over time and cause damage
or death of the CPU speaking of damage
or death of the CPU if in the process of
delayed and you accidentally remove the
small component don't freak out just yet
it's possible that the small component
was a capacitor and if it was your CPU
probably still works just fine you may
have lost some ripple suppression
capabilities or some other power related
optimization but you may not need that
cap for operation we actually have lost
the cap on the 7900 X and it still works
fine if you lose a resistor you might be
screwed but just try not to do that now
for the next step if you are doing
liquid metal rather than Tim or if
you're doing a conductive electrically
conductive Tim some thermal paste is
conductive it's very important that none
of this makes contact none of it spills
over the die and makes contact with the
SMD s or traces that are exposed on the
board so to prevent this one use a very
tiny amount of both just make sure it
spread it by hand make sure it's even
and clean up the excess - you could use
a tape to mask off the SMD s around the
CPU and then remove the tape after
you're done spreading or you could use
something like a nail polish and apply
it over the SMD s and even leave it
there that way if there is spill over
once you've reapplied the IHS it will be
protected at least in theory by the nail
polish and we've actually tested this we
had liquid metal spill over contact
areas that were coated in nail polish
and it didn't short out as for why nail
polish works I'm gonna read a quote from
VSG a friend of the site who works at
thermal bench when asked why 'it nail
polish works so well with liquid metal
BSG said nail polish typically has
nitrocellulose or another functionalized
cellulose in it which forms a thin
stable film without a gap over items
such as fingernails or in this case the
capacitors and alcohol acetate helps
move it into place and
then promptly evaporates leaving behind
just a thin film some nail polish
formulations have benzene derivates
toluene is a prime candidate used by
some companies which does a similar job
as nitrocellulose look at the
composition before buying or using these
as toluene isn't nice to play with even
at lower concentrations so once you've
protected the capacitors it's time to
apply either the electrically conductive
Tim or liquid metal which obviously is
electrically conductive with liquid
metal we kind of learned the hard way
it's very easy to apply way too much
seriously you need far less than you
think because once you start smashing it
around it'll spread out pretty well so
in our original application the first
time we used it just kind of pointing
the thermal grizzly tube down the
syringe down a whole lot of it came out
of the tube and as we learned later you
can siphon it back up just by pulling on
the syringe near it it will suck
straight into the tube so you get rid of
the excess but what we've learned works
pretty well is hold the tube vertically
and very slowly apply pressure on the
syringe plunger until you see a very
tiny dot start to form at the end of the
syringe then you can turn it over kind
of DAB it down a little bit on the CPU
and a very small dot not even a grain of
rice just the smallest possible dot you
can make out of the syringe will come
out you can use that to cover the dye we
would recommend using the black q-tips
that are included with some of the
liquid metal compositions you could use
a normal q-tip as well just make sure
none of the sort of cotton fuzz gets
left behind and leaves a residue but use
a q-tip of some kind spread it over the
surface and the way you know if there's
too much or too little
again as we learned because we shorted
out a capacitor everything was fine at
the end but we shorted it so you got
experience with this
if you've used too much you'll see kind
of a ripple pool where the liquid metal
behaved is like water so if you're
seeing it ripple or if you're seeing a
pool when you move
the cotton swab around that means you've
probably used too much you should siphon
some up with these Rindge or clean it
with rubbing alcohol and spread it
really evenly it should be as thin a
film as you can possibly make without
seeing the dye the eye or the the dye or
the IHS on the opposite side apply this
thin film to both the IHS and the dye
but only over the areas on the IHS where
it will cover the dye and then you can
reseal it on top of the substrate we did
not reseal we just put the IHS back on
top and then use clamping force from the
coolers to seal it all together but if
you're planning to use this in a system
for a long time you could reseal it with
superglue in the corners which we're not
going to talk about how to do today or
you could use a silicone adhesive and
reseal it around the edges just like it
came but then you'd want to probably
clean off the silicone adhesive on the
substrate as well it's not necessary to
reseal with glue but if you're a
consumer it might be worth considering
that said it's really not a big deal to
leave it open just when you carry it
make sure you're transporting it
horizontally because with liquid metal
it can spill or move around if you
haven't clamped it down fully yet and
haven't sealed it but if you sock it
into a board and then install a cooler
that will clamp it down well enough to
effectively be resealed finally if you
do have an issue where it won't boot
once you've done all of this
stop stop trying to turn it on take
everything apart take the lid back off
of the CPU and look carefully if you've
had spillover of an electrically
conductive compound onto capacitors or
other components don't freak out yet it
might not be dead clean it up very
carefully we would recommend rubbing
alcohol and a q-tip or something similar
to that and and then make sure you just
use less when you reseal it this time
and try booting again if all you did was
shorted capacitor it should be just fine
it protected itself it failed the boot
you're good if you cause contact between
other components it could be damaged
permanently but hopefully you can just
clean it off and everything will be
to go this is why we use the nail polish
or other materials to mask off those
SMDs because then you won't have this
problem but that wraps it for this one
so we are not the most experienced
people doing this this is I've done four
of these now but hopefully this helps
guide some of you it's a learning
process for sure the hardest part is the
liquid metal and learning just how much
to use it's very little but the delayed
process is trivial so that's it for now
