low end by a thermal takes level 20
standards level 20 Mt
we're now looking at the 250 dollar a
500 and that would be this case here so
at 250 bucks it's priced at around the
same price point as the Coolermaster h
500m which comes in both a mesh or glass
panel option includes both in the box
and also the dark base pro 900 a highly
regarded case that does well in both
thermal and acoustic scenarios so it's
got really fierce competition this price
point it's not as empty as it used to be
fan tax for example the Evolve EXA
popular case this year is about 200
bucks if you're not factoring in the
mini ITX a comedy event so the a 500 has
a tough fight ahead of it and today
we're gonna be looking at the thermals
the acoustics and the build quality of
thermal takes new $250 flagship before
that this video is brought to you by us
and the G on store one of the best ways
to support us and get something in
return is to grab an item from the G on
store like one of our blue beer glasses
with a gold halo featuring the popular
tear down logo or one of our critically
acclaimed mod mats with wiring diagrams
and a GPU tear down grid we also have a
brand new black and blue mousepad that
many of you requested now available on
the store we keep selling out of things
thanks to you all but we've been working
hard to get it back in stock go to store
gamers nexus net to grab something today
this case does some interesting veins it
does some really minor stuff incredibly
well and it does some kind of major
stuff not that great and an example of
the really small attention to detail in
this case that we did like would be for
example the way in this panel Mouse and
when we go over the building notes I'll
show you in more detail but it has
uneven hinge pins which is a good thing
they're not symmetrical at the top and
the bottom and that makes it easier to
just remove this panel by doing that and
then when you mount it it's extremely
easy to line it back up something that
can't be said for all types of panels
that mount in this fashion so really
small stuff like that thermal takes done
well another example also on the side
panel would be there's no bolt or any
kind of structural
reinforcements on the right side to hold
the panel flush to the case and instead
they're using magnets which isn't that
innovative but in addition to that the
panel does not sag at all and it's a
giant piece of thick glass so they've
done well to keep everything really
flush without going crazy by having a
bunch of mounting hardware that looks
ugly cost more money and if you design
around it which they did you don't need
so job well done there on that small
detail there is this hinge but you don't
need it it does mat just fine without it
so overall externally the case looks not
bad if you look at the front panel you
might write it off instantly because it
is a closed off front but we've seen
this design work actually not bad in
previous don't take cases like the view
71 the question is will it work well
today does the view 71 we went into that
review thinking it would be a horrible
thermal reformer and it actually came
out pretty okay it was in the top half
of the results at the time which is damn
good for a case that had I think two
fans in it and it was just one in the
bottom one on the top and that was it
and it works fine because the rest of
the case was designed around that and it
didn't really need to brute force the
cooling solution for this one there is a
pretty wide gap here it's a little over
an inch maybe but only part of it is
perforated because the rest of it is
filled with I think that's steel pretty
sure it's just stamped out steel behind
the aluminum paneling so there's not as
much breathing space as it might look
like from a profile shot which is
unfortunate and also the fan positioning
more importantly is just kind of odd by
default now this is something you can
easily fix so that's good but they've
positioned two fans in here and one of
them is in the center as you'll see
there and the other one is in the bottom
the question that I would ask you is
what does that do what what does the fan
down here doing because there's a power
supply shroud like in most modern cases
so you're really only getting maybe
about 15% fan coverage above the hub
that's actually able to potentially go
over the shroud and
the air that does make it over is
instantly hitting a hard drive cage
which you can also remove and we've done
these tests for you today or we've
removed the hard drive cages we've
relocated the fans just to see how much
it impacts things but just to give you
an idea out of the box you're looking at
a fan here
that's blasting air straight into a
metal wall and a pretty solid one at
that because it's a hard drive cage so
you remove that and if you do it's still
blowing air basically only at the GPU
the bottom fan is blowing some air at
the GPU and then a whole bunch into
where the cables are and those cables in
that chamber are not getting hot they're
not doing anything not connected to
anything maybe an SSD so a couple of
watts load and on a cable I can that can
withstand many more watts than that so
that the fans just not doing anything
and stock should probably relocate it
and you'll see why in our thermal
section but it'll hit the GPU a little
bit and that's kind of beneficial it's
just there's nothing really going to the
CPU here and that's a that's a design
oversight something that seems to be a
trend for thermal take for this week of
case reviews unfortunately separate from
that to give some positive notes here
build quality on these panels is is very
high and this is extremely sturdy
construction it's thick aluminum on the
front and the top it looks nice and I
mean it's it's expensive material and it
does feel like it and that's good
because it's a 250 dollar case
so if aluminum is your thing this has it
it's just there are other aspects of the
case of course that need to deliver as
well and that's what we'll look at so
let's get into the building notes the
thermals the noise and then see if this
thing's worth 250 bucks when it has so
much competition in the market today the
side panels are hinged and secured it at
the front with both magnets and a large
rotating latches the latches can be
fairly stiff and difficult to operate
without a screwdriver but they're also
only really necessary for transport
since the magnets are plenty strong
enough to hold the doors shut otherwise
they're also knurled so that it is
possible to unscrew them by hand unlike
similar latch is made by Coolermaster
that we've criticized in the past the
doors lift off of their hinges and the
hinge pins are of uneven length which is
actually good because it's very helpful
for guiding them back into place
mentioned in past reviews it's just a
small attention to detail that thermal
takes done well with the hinges are
thick and strongly attached to the glass
panels which are impressively well
aligned with the edges of the case
despite most of the weight being
unsupported so it lines up well as
you'll see in our b-roll shots since the
panel's aren't screwed directly onto the
chassis they have to be aligned entirely
by the placement of the hinges and
tolerances are tight but well executed
the a500 is a heavy case that feels
sturdy the top front and to some extent
the bottom of the case are covered with
plates of three millimeter thick
aluminum and the sides with four
millimeter thick tempered glass both the
front and top panel snap into place with
plastic ball and cup fasteners which is
one of the more thoughtful and easy to
use designs that we've seen
although the pieces are interdependent
the side panels should be opened to more
easily remove the front panel and the
front panel should be removed to get the
top panel back off underneath the top
panel there are several mounting points
for fans but no removable fan tray which
is a feature that we'd like to see in
higher-end cases like this and one we've
seen more popularly showing up this year
the nature of the glued end filters
means that they can't be removed without
permanently altering the case so typical
top exhaust configurations will be
slightly hampered by the unnecessary
obstruction and dust buildup top
radiator mounting is extremely
straightforward in this case the
mounting rails are a 360 millimetres
long and 5 centimeters above the top
edge of the motherboard so there's
plenty of space for any reasonable
closed loop liquid cooler the front
mount is nearly the same but radiators
mounted inside the chassis must share
space with the hard drive cages so
placing a 360 millimeter radiator in the
front of the case removes all 3.5 inch
drive support the stock arrangement of
fans hard drive cages and filters at the
front of the case is suboptimal the
least serious issue is the hard drive
cages which can be removed or
repositioned completely along a rail at
the front similar again to some cases
we've reviewed recently the stock
configuration with two cages installed
behind the intake fans is bad for
thermal performance but it makes more
sense to shift the cages pre-installed
rather than loose and they're easy
enough to move around and remove that
this doesn't really count as a strike
against Thermaltake this
some extra testing in the thermal
section as we tried to find the optimal
case configuration by removing cages and
shifting fans around many of the cases
we reviewed don't support more than two
3.5 inch drive cages and having some
extra hard drive cages on hand is more
positive than negative anyway it's kind
of the opposite of the DL C approach
we've seen from other manufacturers the
two stock intake fans are both
positioned as low as possible on the
front of the case so that both of them
are pointed more towards the power
supply shroud and GPU rather than the
CPU to a point that it's a fault because
there's really no reason to push that
much air into the power supply shroud
especially if it's breathing from the
outside this especially if combined with
those hard drive cages makes it unlikely
that cool air will find its way up to
the top of the case where you might have
a CPU cooler or closed-loop cooler
mounted the 3 120 millimeter case fans
all spin at 1,000 rpm max which really
isn't enough to effectively pull air in
through the mesh strips along either
side of the front panel although there's
also an unfiltered hole on the bottom
both side panels are transparent so KL
management needs to be good which it
actually is there velcro straps screwed
into the chassis in a line that can
handle the bulk of power and i/o cables
there's three centimeters of space
between the glass side panel and the
chassis across its entire width so
there's no need for a special cable
management channel
compare that to a more typical one point
5 centimeter gap in the level 20 MT and
it's clear just how much space that is
it's also reasonable to remove the hard
drive cage underneath the shroud for
extra cable space since there are 4 3.5
inch LEDs that can be mounted above the
shroud yes there is a vertical GPU mount
but no we didn't test it this time we
don't recommend mounting air-cooled
cards up against unventilated glass
panels and we've already proven that
it's a bad idea at least 20 times this
year it should be fine for liquid cooled
cards and thermal take has put a little
more effort into their implementation
than most by including a removable
mounting plate for PCIe riser cable but
this is again really something you need
to use with an open-loop cooling card
thermal testing for the a500 was
exhaustive for this one and exhausting
it included a total of five
configurations alongside all the
cases we normally show and those five
are just for the a500
our testing configurations focused first
on the stock a 500 enclosure then aims
to improve performance to reach full
potential by modifying the stock setup
test variations offer a look at
performance without any hard drive cages
obstructing intake a test with the front
pans shifted up for more balanced
airflow attached with fans that moved up
and the hard drive cage is removed and
then a standardized test with the front
panel removed let's get a CPU torture
chart on the screen first to look at
thermal influence of the thermal take a
500 case only against itself will add
comparative data in the next chart stock
the case didn't do too well it's at
about 68 degrees Celsius over ambient
for cbiit orders thermals we postulated
that most of this poor performance was
to blame on the fan positioning if you
look at where they are it sort of makes
sense nothing really straight lines up
with a CPU cooler so we shifted the fans
upwards for balance this brought
thermals down to 57 point 7 degrees
Celsius over ambient with idle
temperature also dropped to 7 degrees
from an impressively high 9.5 degrees
over ambient not an impressive in a good
way
by the way removing the hard drive cages
but keeping the stock fan configuration
put us at 63 degrees over ambient
enabling a noteworthy performance
improvement just by removing unused hard
drive cages we like that thorough all
take includes them with this case so
we'll just note that you should pull
them out if they have no immediate use
moving the fans up and removing the hard
drive cages doesn't do as much since it
also moves the air flow path above the
cages we end up at 56 degrees over
ambient with this setup removing the
front panel entirely and leaving the fan
configuration and drive stock we end up
measuring a CPU temperature of 55 point
6 degrees over ambient about the same as
the previous measurement and within
margin of error
comparatively with just the stock and
best case configuration on the charge
that puts the a500 near the land call 1
when its stock configuration both within
margin of error of each other the NZXT
s340 elite is similar in performance to
the modified a 500 thermal takes view 71
in stock configuration outperforms the
modified a 500 by roughly 1 degrees
Celsius which is a massive improvement
over the stock a 500 before
sixty-eight degrees the dark based Pro
900 is priced about the same and ends up
near the a500 performance just for
comparison by price point the
Coolermaster h 500m also deserves a
highlight here and thermally decimates
the a 500 while costing the same the a
500 in stock configuration is between
the Enzo and the Walmart dtw which is
impressively poor performance this
speaks to limitations of fan positioning
the front panel the hard drive cage
obstructions and overall design
fortunately two of these things are
easily resolved as illustrated with the
modified results if you're willing to
remove the drive cages and you probably
are most people don't have that many of
these days and you're willing to move
the fans up and you probably are or to
add a fan the a500 does fine it's not
impressive not for $250 it's not
impressive or $100 but whatever but it's
fine it's about average no better no
worse just don't keep it in full stock
configuration if you're adding closed
loop or open-loop coolers those
obviously will overcome many of the
limitations but it's by brute force and
he put those same parts in one of these
other cases they'll still perform better
it's just that if you really want the
look yes you can brute force the
performance and then you get the look
moving on to GPU torture and starting
first with just the a500
the stock configuration does better this
time around stock performance measures
fifty-two degrees over ambient for the
GPU diode significantly better than CPU
performance as a result of the fan
positioning pointed straight at the GPU
removing the front panel is the only
means we improved performance over stock
planting the a500 at 49 degrees over
ambient that just shows that the front
panel isn't as massive and inhibitor to
GPU thermals at least as it was with CPU
or we don't have any static pressure up
there at all and that's because again
both front fans are blasting the GP with
air removing the hard drive cages
doesn't impact performance here who are
with in error margins so the results are
functionally the same removing the cages
and moving the fans up post a
temperature increase of about 6 degrees
over stock this is a better balance than
the stock configuration we think but CPU
temperature drops significantly with
this layout as well GPU impact isn't
nearly as large so if you want to run
relatively stock we'd recommend this
layout just moving the fans increase
gpo temperature the most as expected
because we now have obstructions and
less direct airflow to the GPU
comparatively the a500 stock
configuration is about tied with the H
500 ppm ass a case which does reasonably
well and GPU thermals and very well in
CPU thermals in fact if you go in for
thermals and a similarly sized case we
just recommend the aged 500 people match
over the a 500 it's about 100 to 150
dollars cheaper depending on when you
buy it and has more balance to thermal
performance for both CPU and GPU
components the view of 71 is about one
degree ahead of the a 500 just for
another thermal take reference point
it's really not bad just imbalanced to
favor GPU thermals and even those are
average at $250 to the a 500 we should
also highlight the cooler master h 500
mm mash at 49 degrees which costs about
the same and is also significantly more
balanced for thermals 3dmark testing is
next so this is basically a gaming
benchmark so if that's all you do this
is what you want to look at the therm
will take 8,500 ends up around with a
view 70 once it's rough way up 54
degrees over ambient for the GPU that
said if you take a look at CPU thermals
you'll notice that the 8500 runs about
10 degrees hotter the cooler master H
500 M mash runs at about 52 degrees over
ambient for the GPU not a huge change
but the CPU runs at 22 degrees which is
a huge change overall gaming workload
performance is represented well by 3
mark the results are overall average for
the a500 blender render testing on just
the CPU reduces the overall heat
generation inside of the case instead of
only running the CPU at maximum load the
GV is not really doing much this is a
realistic load and a common use case but
one which stresses the a500 more than
most as a result of its already detailed
CPU cooling problem the a500 operates at
around 42 degrees over ambience for the
CPU it's fine
it's not going to cause any damage but
it's still nearly the worst on the chart
the only case is worse than this or the
BitFenix Enzo which has literally zero
holes in the front panel the $50 spec Oh
for that new egg recently struggled to
give away and the Walmart dtw case which
well you know for GPU thermals with
blender the a500 ends up a bit above
average the GPU does well with a 20
I point six degree results tie in with
the H 500 ppm at the H 700 and the
silent basic so want but the CPD result
is hotter than most considering the CPU
isn't really doing anything other than
scheduling the GPU here it's performance
is unimpressive to say the least
and finally noise levels allow the a500
to be partially vindicated after it's
embarrassing performance in the thermal
section the a 500 ends up at about
thirty five point one DBA right around
the BitFenix Shogun the dark bass pro
900 and better than the cooler master H
500 mm at forty point seven DBA results
although it's also better than cooling
so it's a trade-off still as we recently
showed in our airflow vs. silence
testing having better air flow means
that you can reduce fan noise to a point
that you reach equivalent noise levels
with a quieter case either way the a500
at least does decently a noise but this
does teach us that its biggest
inhibitors are first its fans and
there's static pressure and then it's
fan positioning and obstructions the
answer to is it worth $250 is as it
often is it depends and in general that
answer is probably no but if you really
like the look then there's not much
getting around that you can make this
case work just expect to either spend
some extra on fans may be going with
open loop or closed loop cooling in that
case you brute force your way to success
going to open or closed loop in a non
performance binding scenario where
you're not blasting overclocks
you'll be fine the water will make up
for any inhibitions in the front panel
any obstructions the hard drive cage is
all that stuff even if you fill the hard
drive cages which would be actually very
bad for thermals but even if you do
going on with water cooling will make up
for a lot of that so that's a point
where if you like the look and you're
doing liquid then it'll work it's not
gonna be the best but it will work and
it's hard to account for looks if that's
really what you have your heart set on
if that's not something you care
tremendously about there is better
competition from cooler masters age 500m
which was a significant recovery from
the age 500 P and the H 500 M will note
has
kind of embellishments on it that really
aren't all that special so if you wanted
to save a whole lot of money you can get
the H 500 be mesh for a similar look
it's just that it's it's white and it's
doesn't have that full glass cover that
the H 500 mm has now once you put the
glass cover on performance isn't so
great it's much better with a mesh front
but it looks pretty good so that's good
competition it's got a RGB features it's
it's fine it's it's superior to this in
many categories it's just that it
doesn't look the same and there's not
anything else you can do about that if
that's what you care about other
competitions dark Bass Pro 900 we did
encourage looking at that one as well it
is superior in a few categories it's
huge
it is pretty much fully modular and that
you can invert the case although it's a
pain a real pain in the ass to do it but
you could do it and it's unique but it's
a very different case in the design
sense of of what it's trying to achieve
so it just comes down to do you like the
way this looks and if the answer is
anything except for I don't want
anything else except for this case next
to my computer then you shouldn't buy it
if that's the answer there's not much
else you can get so the fan tax evolve X
is probably about the closest and
overall style to this one and that's
about 200 bucks if you don't buy the
Mini ITX kit and it's really not a
terrible case once you go to the 400
dollar price point it's kind of rough in
a few ways but that would be worthwhile
competition to consider as well and we
have review on that if you care so
that's it for this one pretty pretty
disappointed in these last tooth they're
all take cases Thermaltake has speaking
of the disappointment I guess we've got
the right shirt on for it although it's
gone so they can't buy any sorry they're
sold out but Thermaltake has some really
good ideas here and they did with the
level 20 as well so like the company is
capable of doing good thins and making
good products it's just they they seem
that consistently in the last two cases
screw up on really small
or a wealth really really obvious things
like for example putting a dust filter
in front of the fans not next to them
that's an obvious thing it's a big thing
to screw up but it's such a small basic
concept to get right in designing a case
that you almost overlooked a reviewer
because who would do that
apparently it's thermaltake and a good
case that then I'll take makes would be
something like the Corp III extremely
unique very usable in different
environments you have it standing up as
a test bench or just the normal system
you can have it as flat test bench you'd
mount it to a wall that's a cool case
and Thermaltake did that well but then
you look at stuff like this or the level
twenty mt and it's just it seems like
it's completely reversed from the
products they do well it might be
different people different teams I don't
know my understanding is that that HQ
more or less is in charge of the designs
and we're still trying to talk to
someone at HQ who does the designs
because a lot of these other companies
we get the opportunity to speak to PMS
and case designers and try and
understand why do they do the things
they do and with Thermaltake it's one of
the few companies where we just we're
left in the dark as reviewers as to why
do you make these decisions is there a
good reason to make some of these weird
decisions that you've made and there
might be but until they tell us we're
never now so it's just a lot of big
oversights on things that seems small in
terms of the the level of complexity or
the level of comprehension it requires
to understand that thing that is being
overseen like again filters in front of
the fans or having a bit more of a gap
for air to come through you can still
have all of these design elements
visually that Thermaltake has without
just completely sacrificing performance
or the value proposition in some
instances I 250 bucks is a lot of money
and at that price point for a computer
case the cost of a CPU or GPU you really
can't afford to make the kinds of
mistakes that thermaltake has been
making for the last couple of cases it's
it's too much money to make mistakes
can't get away with it the users won't
have it if you're selling 50k
she can get away with a whole lot of
mistakes but that's not what this is
so anyway subscribe for more hopefully
Thermaltake will have some better stuff
for us to see at CES we'll be there soon
you're subscribed you'll see that
coverage go to stored I cameras XS net
to pick up a shirt not like this one
because it's sold out but we're probably
going to reintroduce just the front of
this design and get rid of the 2018 part
on the back because it won't be 2018
anywhere so thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
