Donette and i am here with space
underscore man space man what is up hey
you guys in here and ready to kill some
more Oryx targeted to kill we're gonna
change so that's the idea of this game
it's actually I think it's called orcs
must be hugged so I think we're doing it
wrong oh hello I think I might've must
have bought the wrong game we're gonna
put down some traps we had some we
actually did a test run of this level
first and noticed that the spring traps
on the bottom we're shooting orcs up to
the top over there so space has found a
solution for that I think now some of
you who have if you've played this game
you may think why are we not using
archers everywhere since it seems like
they would be way better than these trap
but that seemed kind of archers are lame
they're not really trapped soaring way
to do we're on a better anyway yeah
actually uh in our last video where I
played with dr. gone we played this
level shortly after and just surrounded
this portal and archers and it worked
very well but was much less fun so we're
gonna try this time with I just ran into
up before we even start sigh hey that
may be a sign of things to come sigh hey
can you respond into entire eastern will
start 10 I can't put ceiling traps up
there by the way so I owe me neither so
lots of shooting down flyers I get yeah
looks that way
okay just fixing the fraps recording it
was a little laggy but we're back now
the push trap worked on one guy but the
next one got so many flyers why
uh this may not work as well as we hope
haha get they're not coming through the
next one yet
we're good
nice more photographs yeah definitely
more I straps
what you guys say must be at least this
tall to enter yeah he does say that he
didn't say it for me right now I guess
the blank sink or he's crazy which is
definitely possible we already knew that
thing
more fire I want more fire damn it we're
on the walls
Oh actually I guess that'll just thought
them out from my I strap we'll see how
it works though
how do we got over here
damn
those heavy works are really obnoxious
to deal with
here comes a big guy
charmed
ah this tiny fans explode so easily
oh you know what I can do it I can put
fries traps up there with that haymaker
is and they'll freeze and fall down like
I think they fall out of the sky when
they freeze NB 0 behind us
you deal with the earth things oh ok I
was going to the other the other things
crab thankfully on it that's right we
still got this ok they're right huh
while looking towards the bed didn't you
already fall in the lava once I guess it
wasn't Holman that's what I that's what
I said yeah I didn't want to believe it
sell this thing
I can only fit two up there that's lame
oh sweet i can put some here put in a
couple arrow traps there oops I place
that care
feather fall is so fun
nice into the lava
very
lots of fires
you seem to be good at dealing with a
sweet the freeze trap works perfectly
I'll get the stuff behind us
whoops just turned around
that's up on the other set
Josh this mini map so confusing
I hope that elemental freeze is yep
what's left
okay what do we need more of
any ideas spring-trap think the answer I
wanted to hear was fire that's probably
a lot better than the spring traps but
spring traps are physics hey you
wouldn't want arguing for pot you're
right fire fire has physical properties
that counts also the prepared of those
spring traps eventually result in the
orcs burning up in a fiery death in lava
true and the combo better spring traps
don't arriving fire traps don't really
combo with anything just sort of killed
hired combos with everything especially
more fire it's true and otherwise right
that is why i'm using a crossbow made
out of fire that shoots bolts of fire
I want to play this I want to play this
level on a nightmare mood Oh guys behind
traps are so awesome
wow those fries traps work really well
with the bigger enemies because they
just freeze them and then the haymaker
kills them in like one or two hits yep
do you
more haymakers and more fire
oh sweet look I can put fire on the
ceiling Oh fire on the ceiling
you don't you need up here our steam
traps to shoot them up into more push
traps or alternatively steam traps to
consume all their time with the summer
sale
go go
those things get hard
have you watched these push traps yep
pretty off oh my god I'm screwed but
they're getting pushed down into spring
traps which then spring them to the
other side or they get pushed down again
that it may not be efficient but it's
pretty cool I think I gets you the most
points though like the more combos the
more money I'm not sure falling in the
lobby gives you a lot of points though
oh maybe not I by which I mean me
falling in the lava this is true 10 out
of 10 from the Russian judge
I'll get the back
needs more fire
haha ice is awesome
yike
well those haymakers are hilarious
pretty nice but we need more spring trap
I love the sprain in to push into
spraying in to push into lava
swine haha
need to get more recording of it
Oh
I got the Flyers under control
I ever did
watch that and all
by which I mean watch that and all died
from acid I didn't even see him Oh whole
effort gets to waste oh uh
these traps are so effective
I want to make an oven I have flame
traps facing inward now
so many flyers
I'm just watching the words go up and
then back down some guys coming in
behind dips work
we have big stuff coming in from the
front I'll let you handle the back
battle battle trolls
oh alright france under control eggs
okay forget it major still one more near
you
I might need help Oh got him aah no one
got through yeah still good other than
the whole jumping in the lava and
letting things through yes sir stats dem
stats
not too bad
how many kills did you get uh 430 shared
I don't know okay guess these are shared
yeah and 460 two of them were trapped
kills that's pretty sweet well it did a
probably separate sense probably
separate ah maybe yeah 478 that we
killed biting them 462 from track nice
that's a lot of works yeah it's more
than a thousand works no you need to
work on your map I think that's enough
of this one for now so film some more
levels and check back next time for more
orcs being sprung into aurochs into
spring traps into lava into spring traps
and fire this yeah physics and the N
word of the day physics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
