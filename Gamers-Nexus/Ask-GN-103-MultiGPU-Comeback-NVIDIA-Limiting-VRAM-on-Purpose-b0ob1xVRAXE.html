Jian episode as always leave your
questions in the comments section below
for next week the mess on the table
hopefully you've seen by now is from
responding to Jay and his undying need
to post higher scores by using extremely
brute force methods so we took an also
brute force method that was very slow to
put together so you'll see that
hopefully on the channel already but as
always leave your questions below we
have a couple good ones this week that
will go a bit detailed on like game
graphics settings things like that so as
I said last week if you have game
graphics questions specifically we're
trying to answer more of those lately
leave them below before that this video
is brought to you by the be quiet dark
rock 4 and dark rock Pro for CPU coolers
these high-end coolers to focus on a
smarter approach to air cooling by
adding a mini fin stack on top of the
direct contact cold plate adding small
bumps to the fins for increased surface
area and by using silent wanes 135
millimeter fans custom-built for high
performance cooling without too much
noise the pro is a duel tower cooler
rated for 250 watt TDP while the dark
rock 4 is built for 200 watt CDP's learn
more at the link of the description
below so quick note on the store as
always we've a lot of things coming back
in stock the anniversary logo with the
teal design is coming back in this graph
logo shirt is mostly in stock right now
and then the blue tinted beer glasses
are in with the gold rim if you like
those and of course the mod mats are
actually in stock and shipping now it's
not on backorder anymore first question
is about multi-gpu making a comeback and
this is from the dire lynx who said with
Nvidia's a new envy link connector for
SLI and Andy's rumored counterpart XG mi
as well as a newer Nvidia sponsored
titles working very well with multi-gpu
setups do you think multi GB will make a
comeback how do you feel about multi-gpu
seemingly becoming more and more of a
focus for both companies and do you
think we'll see AMD try the same thing
they did with the RX 480
when na'vi eventually comes higher
comparing higher end end video cards to
multi-gpu set up and they will do
whatever they need to do to market their
card as as superior so if it happens to
be that multi-gpu will look superior
and they can do it at the same price
when you combine two cards which is one
of them videos then yeah they'll revisit
that angle it's just either company's
gonna do whatever makes them look the
best so if that's what it is then yeah
they'll visit that angle for sure as for
making a comeback though I'm gonna go
with no on this probably not because
there's there's actually when we tested
SLI which is what NV link is just that's
a lie for gaming when we tested it there
were surprising amount of games that
actually do have scaling these days but
if you look at the games that have it in
a lot of cases they didn't really get
support until later so post launch and
it sucks to own $2,500 video card if you
have 220 ATT eyes and have to wait for
who knows how long for a patch to come
out where SLI starts actually working so
that's a problem for sure the the wait
time is I think a big no-go for a lot of
people just also because it's completely
nebulous you don't know if they're ever
going to support multi GPU and then also
the companies so Nvidia all but
abandoned multi-gpu for Pascal they
killed it like they killed three and
4-way GPU setups completely there was a
way to do it with special unlock codes
at the start I think it opened up a bit
but games just didn't natively support
it so that that died so they narrowed it
down to two way GPU setups and weren't
even promoting that that hard I mean at
all the press day events and all those
talks for all the new Pascal launches
multi-gpu is not even a discussion topic
and if it was brought up the people at
Nvidia more or less kind of disregarded
it as just a non option so it was pretty
much done away with in Pascal our t axis
does feel like it's getting a bit of a
revisit part of that's because there's a
new bridge even though it's still sli
it's a new bridge so I guess that makes
it exciting again and it kind of like
obscures that it's actually the same
technology so I think the thing here is
Nvidia realizes that actually selling
the same person lots of cards to put in
one system is a really appealing idea so
maybe they'll revisit and try and push
it and make it actually viable and there
has been as I said more support for SLI
so credit to them there the scalene
isn't perfect a lot of times it really
does feel like kind of a waste if you
spent a lot of money you're getting 40%
scaling for example you still get
negative scaling entitles you still get
micro stuttering games because of AFR
and there are all kinds of problems with
multi-gpu where even if Nvidia does
everything they possibly can to make it
good and I believe that to some extent
they are you're still leaning on engine
developers and game developers as we'll
talk about and I think the next question
to really make it work and that means
there's a dependency and if the market
share of multi-gpu is really low then
why would they why would the developers
pursue optimizing for it and making it
work so I don't know I really don't see
it making a huge comeback unless there's
a significant change in in the current
for the market if everyone starts going
multi-gpu as a consumer then maybe but
there's there too many dependencies in
there there's too much uncertainty with
how long you're gonna wait is it ever
gonna work well game developers
supported all that stuff and also the
new cards are really expensive too so
I'm gonna go with no for my answer for
this maybe in the future but for the
current cards I'm leaning towards them
now and there are games like Sniper
Elite 4 that have phenomenal scaling but
there aren't many developers who will
build a game that well just in terms of
the engineering side of it not even
gameplay so that's you can't base the
decision to go multi-gpu as a consumer
on the like three games that have 100%
scaling so that's let's talk about this
some more though the next question why
does multigp scale poorly so this is by
supa who said fundamentally what causes
such poor scaling in most games when
using SLI or is it on V link is it due
to the latency of communication between
the two or more GPUs first of all to
answer the the internal parentheses
erekle question there NV link is SLI for
purposes of this discussion and Vidya
has more or less converted they brought
SLI on to n viewing
and Vela actually let me just read build
Zoids answer it builds I jumped in to
this discussion on the discord and
answered it so I don't read his here
build Zoid said the problem with SLI is
SLI it's not a bandwidth problem one
reason the twenty series it uses an NB
link connector instead of SLI is that
the twenty series are compute
accelerated cards and NV link is used
for vram sharing and compute
applications it's easier to port SLI
functionality on to NV link than it is
to have both NV link and SLI interfaces
on the twenty series the reason why I so
I sucked so much is that it's really
hard to evenly split up workloads
between multiple GPUs the easiest method
for having two GPUs rendering is to have
each GPU render every other frame AFR or
alternate frame rendering the problem
with AFR is it produces micro stutter
unless you spend some time synchronizing
the cards which results in lower fps the
other issue is that there's a bunch of
post-processing effects that do not work
with AFR other than that multi-gpu also
puts more load on the CPU
finally multi-gpu has problems with some
engines just straight-up not being able
to deal with having two or more
rendering devices split frame and super
tile rendering eliminate some of the AFR
issues but give smaller performance
gains multi-gpu basically needs a ton of
work from the rendering engine
developers to make it work
which is why benchmarks like 3dmark can
show basically perfect multi-gpu scaling
while some game games end up literally
losing performance with every additional
GPU so build Zoid did a great job
answering this to expand on that builds
are noted that sun and if you don't know
who he is check out his channel actually
hardcore overclocking on youtube but to
get into some of this so post-processing
effects builds are noted as a problem if
you work with any kind of multi GP
you'll notice that there are a lot of
anti-aliasing options that do not work
with multi-gpu TAA is one of them so
temporal anti-aliasing where you go in
temporally so taste on time it's framed
the frame comparison previous frame next
frame look at the changes on the frame
and then do some anti-aliasing based on
those changes so that you're really
focusing on the areas of movement and
and that just doesn't play well with
multi-gpu
at all and some of the games we tested
it on actually shadow the Tomb Raider
we got hard fails like blue screens BSOD
is from multi-gpu
so that's problem disabling taa did
pretty much put a stop to that but it
did still sometimes have a hard crash or
freeze minimizing was completely broken
in in shadow of the Tomb Raider as well
with multi GPU and they're working to
develop drivers further for that game I
think enmity is working with the game
developers on it so this is stuff that
should be largely resolved but this is
why going back to the previous question
I don't think multigp will make comeback
because not many people have the
patience to put up with that I mean
especially a single-player game because
realistically how long are you playing
that games like Skyrim notwithstanding
where you're looking at a month two
months of updates to get the set up to
work and by then you might have just
disabled that's a lie and played through
it on one card because you don't you
don't want to wait
so anyway going back to a builder was
saying though and what causes poor
scaling a lot of this does come down to
engine developers a lot of it can come
down to API as well so the first
implementation of Vulcan and doom just
straight did not support multi GPU and I
don't know what the status of Doom is
these days for multi-gpu I haven't
benchmark in a while please feel free to
leave a comment but I do know that like
DirectX 12 is a great example of an API
that has done a lot for multi-gpu it has
actually we have another question about
this it has the ability to illuminate
bridges entirely so you can just go with
explicit multi-gpu over the PCIe bus you
start running as a PCIe bandwidth
limitations and some games but
developers don't really use it because
it actually takes a lot of effort to
implement multi-gpu and go with DirectX
12 explicit multi-gpu approach where you
can have arbitrary multiple cards like
an rx 580 with an art 480 for example or
a 390 X with an Rx 580 as another
example you could do things like that
actually I think we even tested
something like I want to say an Nvidia
card and an AMD card in the same system
with ashes
so ashes isn't really a game it's a
benchmark and because of that the the
benchmark at this point has been
developed to a point where it does
really cool things like explicit
multi-gpu
but it's not in any games because the
game developers are busy making the game
the gameplay mechanics and can it not
suck and the benchmark developers just
have to make the technology work so
that's that's a lot of the poor
multi-gpu scaling split frame and super
tile render and have their own issues
and also still have to be implemented so
a lot of this comes down to
implementation technology does not just
work out of the box that's the big
problem why not use the PCIe bus instead
of bridges that's the next question from
Luke matters and this is a good one so
this is they all go in together today
Luther matters said I seem just a
question about SLI R and V link I saw a
video benching twenty eighty from mining
and they used two cards and didn't have
the actual NV link the guy said it
didn't matter because remaining soft I
ran both cards equally anyway why hasn't
software for general use benchmarks for
gaming been developed to bypass the
hardware link which seems to degrade
scaling value in my opinion if the cards
were run as independent cards processing
the same image would it be technically
possible to get 100% performance from
each card so first I'll refer to the
previous answer of course for a lot of
this because that contains a lot of the
the answer to this parts of this
question but one thing I wanted to note
with this is talking about specifically
the lack of a bridge you don't need a
bridge to do multi-gpu but if you
eliminate the bridge you have to
communicate via the PCIe bus and
although if you have multiple cards in X
8 or X 16 or whatever there's really no
scaling concerns with the bridge there
are scaling concerns without a bridge
because that bridge has its own
bandwidth so the cards can communicate
with each other and bypass the PCIe bus
so that actually does come into play and
check out our NV link benchmark of the
2080 TI's or 20 eighties whatever it was
to see more of that because Ashley the
singularity is a game game and big
quotes where multi GB was implemented in
a way that bypasses the bridge so let's
go into this a bit when I wrote about
this originally and tested it one of the
things that I wrote about was so I said
multi-gpu configurations with ashes of
the singularities dx12 environment
operate using arbitrary alternate frame
rendering or AFR ashes can support both
l
which is linked display adapter or
traditional SLI and crossfire and MDA or
multi display adapter and then LD eight
works with SLI bridges and crossfire
bridges MDA works by just running the
two display adapters that bridge is
relying on the PCIe bus for
communication MDA also allows for
multiple off-brand or off model GPUs to
function in somewhat harmonious
processing so that's what I wrote about
it then and this is a way to bypass the
bridge these days you start running into
pcie 3.0 bandwidth limitations at the
very very high end the low end it's fine
like mid-range cards 200 bucks something
like that so as for why well I mean
that's that's why that's why bridges are
still a thing because of the you're most
likely going to combine cards by the way
it has been pushed these days at the
high end and so that means that you need
a bridge cuz you're gonna run into
limits also the companies don't really
of course want you combining low end
cards to surpass their high end cards so
it'll be pushed towards the high end but
I think I think I've answered most of
your question between this one in the
previous two mining is a lot different I
should say that so mining just is way
different of an application you're not
worried about rendering frames and
mining just it's just all compute from
what I understand or some of it might be
on the memory but either way the cards
don't I don't think I'm almost positive
they don't need to share any data with
each other so that's that's the big
reason you can get away with those
risers also latency is not quite as much
of a concern either next one which game
graphics settings hit performance the
most so fredrik kempe Anya said question
about game graphics settings after
touring with the graphics settings in
Forza Motorsport 7 it seems like motion
blur anti-aliasing and reflections on
track surfaces when wet are the graphic
services graphic settings that are
affecting my games performance the most
what are other settings you could
suggest I should look for and maybe even
explaining their impact excuse me on the
system's resources not specifically for
this game but more on in general basis
this is something I used to do a lot of
so we used to do those game graphics
guides all
we did a big one for GTA The Witcher 3
black ops 3 a couple other games mostly
involving the number three and they were
pretty well-received so let's go through
some of this first of all I'm not gonna
address every single graphics detail I'm
sure some commentary is gonna be like
doh my god what you forgot to say
whatever probably didn't literally
forget it's just I mean this is not
really meant to be a game graphics
settings video so I'm gonna go over a
few of them that I found are the most
interesting but not necessarily the so
we'll go through a bunch that are most
impactful and that may be one or two
that have really no impact and I'm leave
all I'll leave all the other ones with
no impact out for now so first up you
should be looking at mesh detail and
geometry settings to reduce draw calls
on the CPU lowering mesh detail for
example in Call of Duty resulted in some
embellishments disappearing from prop
vehicles and other props in the game a
good example would be non drivable tanks
or jeeps where the headlights would
simplify or even disappear which reduces
the amount of primitives which would be
triangles for example that have to be
rendered this lessens load on both the
CPU and GPU but reducing draw calls and
dx11 will benefit low end CPU is
disproportionately more next texture
quality for VRAM if you're limited on
vram or video card memory texture
quality has a huge impact lower quality
textures will reduce texture resolution
eg to 128 by 128 or 256 by 2 to 6 or
higher
because textures are not typically
procedurally generated almost never are
and are pre fabricated by the game's
artists there's not much computational
load on the GPU aside from related
transforms to apply the texture to a
service the load generated is more space
related so when you're working with a
higher texture resolution it's almost
purely VRAM as a bigger image file takes
more space when it needs to sit around
waiting to be called this can be left to
higher settings if theorem is sufficient
as it will not meaningfully impact frame
rate beyond frame buffer limitations LOD
scaling has the biggest noticeable
impact to both visual quality and
performance
perhaps aside from anti-aliasing impact
on performance LOD scaling determines
the number of vertices or polygons and
objects as they vary in distance the
recent Nvidia asteroids demo is a great
representation
how this works this doesn't normally
have full or we rather don't normally
have full access to this setting in game
graphics options but some games allow
for LOD modifications as an object gets
further away there isn't any point to
drawing it in full detail of course we
can't see it and so scaling down detail
at far distances helps preserve both
VRAM and computational power especially
if you're talking about a lot of draw
calls on the CPU
that said geometry poppin becomes more
of an issue to a point where an object
will look like it's changing as you
approach it just sort of transmogrifying
so that's something we saw in the FF XV
demo previously and obviously something
you want to avoid view distance is one
of the biggest changes to performance
GTA 5 has a few views and sliders that
can affect poppin and object draw
distance entirely this is different from
LED scaling and that it completely
toggles when things pop into view so
it's not a change of the mesh detail or
whatever it's a change of the object
being there or not the major impact on
performance is because it prevents
objects from being drawn but it can also
affect gameplay quality which is a
concern in our old Witcher 3 graphics
settings deep dive we found foliage
visibility range to have a severe impact
to game performance but minimal impact
to gameplay quality so that'd be a good
example of something to change whereas
buta stance even though it's a huge
impact the gameplay for game performance
it's also huge impact to gameplay and
you want to avoid that aspect so it'd be
better to tweak things like shadows
ambient occlusion grass quality foliage
view distance and anti-aliasing rather
than maybe view distance because you
actually really want that view to since
a lot of games to see where your enemies
are things like that ambient occlusion
is another one so on the same guide for
the Witcher 3 we found having an
occlusion to be somewhat noteworthy and
its impact aao settings can change or
will change how light interacts with
neighboring materials you have two
objects next to each other the and they
are using ambient occlusion you'll see
increased shadow contrast that connected
services and overall added apparent
depth to the viewer we typically see a
few percentage points of performance
impact they owe not massive but enough
to disable it because the actual
gameplay value is effectively zero but
the visual quality value is debatable
depending on the game grass quality
we've really found that graphs quality
has a massive performance impact
including in our recent Final Fantasy
benchmark and GTA testing if you don't
feel attached to tall grass
grass which deforms the movement sable
in it will help a lot
shadows are next to the drawing shadows
of every object on the screen is
expensive and not that valuable to
gameplay at the end of the day so this
is a good option to look at if you're
using soft shadows as multi-tap sampling
out the borders that can also impact
performance in a big way
lowering shadow settings hopefully
should disable shadows of unimportant
environment objects or props first like
maybe a cup or silverware on the table
or something like that and instead focus
on only drawing shadows for the actors
and large objects anti-aliasing has the
biggest performance impact of all this
samples multiple times per pixel maybe
eight times or four times or something
like that
so you're effectively rendering the
entire image at a higher resolution FXAA
is a cheap form of anti-aliasing called
fast approximate anti-aliasing instead
of sampling each pixel on a 3d object
multiple times it finds and smoothes
object edges based upon object depth
doesn't look great but typically has a
near zero impact performance anisotropic
filtering also has function zero impacts
and can be left on 16x2 the most part
and isotropic filtering is used to
ensure textures are proportionate to the
screens viewing angle a good example
would be a road fading to a vanishing
point on the screen where trilinear
filtering would become blurry but in
isotropic filtering it would retain
texture detail in the distance it
doesn't uniformly filter textures but
instead filters dependent upon each
textures location on the screen relative
to the camera angle this can have some
vrm impact as you sample more times per
pixel
but it's negligible on modern hardware
and you can max this setting out and
depending on how they're calculated
particle settings are also typically
okay to increase in quality if they're
physically accurate particles you'll see
more strain on the CPU some games have
minimal impact from bloom terrain
quality these days it just depends on
how complex the terrain is all right so
that should help with that question next
one Ram overclocking Grim 13 asked
wondering what exact get of Ram you're
using a rip J stream and if you have any
recommendations for generally well
overclocking performance sticks I know
g.skill and their B die memes are highly
regarded overall but not sure if I
should just try to tune a 3200 CL 14 kit
or by 4000 we reason the G scale Trident
II black 3600 kit and the reason it did
so well is because I
clocks at the 4,000 and then I don't
think we've by the time this video goes
up we should have published it but I
also manually tuned every single time
and exposed through the EVGA BIOS all of
them so you can get a lot of performance
if you're willing to sit there for a day
and play with every single time and not
really worth it for non competitive
benchmarking honestly you'll get more
performance but when you're tuning stuff
at the very like tertiary timings it's
it's getting a bit time-consuming and
unless you really know what you're doing
and I'm still learning so it takes me a
long time but just buying a higher-end
kit doesn't make it easier though
because there's no guarantee at first of
all XMP can't fit every timing in it so
buying a high-rent kit doesn't mean
those tertiary titans will get tuned for
you can still have motherboards do
really stupid things with timings like
run for example RFC or something like
that really high and maybe run the
Refresh interval really low and and so
that's not great but that comes down to
the motherboards - so like 46 hundred
megahertz kits are kind of a marketing
play entirely a marketing play because
you need a good bin on the IMC you need
a good motherboard hopefully have a good
bit on the core as well so now you try
to bend to things they're a good core
good IMC and the memory and to actually
hit 4600 on a kit rated for 4600 is
really difficult like it takes manual
work in a lot of instances so just
buying high-end doesn't make it work
necessarily you might love to put the
effort in
definitely check the motherboard
compatibility list for RAM as well but
honestly 3200 CL 14 is great and
perfectly fine for gaming and all that
stuff for what we're doing with times by
different scenario but not also
completely impractical let's do this one
next is nvidia purposefully limiting
vram and 'if Underberg asked a while
asked what mla a I think for a bit but
let me dive into the first question here
do you feel Nvidia is purposefully
limiting vram to keep the lifespan low
some more sophisticated models are
unable to run on older cards if so why
are we not talking about expandable
memory on GPUs if we're okay with a GPU
costs are taking two point seven five
slots be
over a thousand dollars or just have the
option to upgrade memory or GPU sockets
no we've talked about this in the past
but let me take this piece by piece
because you have you have some good
questions in here and I I think they're
all worth addressing so first of all are
they purposefully limiting vram the
answer to that just that part are they
purposefully limiting vram the answer is
basically yes but everyone's
purposefully limiting different things
of the product but now what price point
they're trying to hit but specifically
for this one I'm going to bring this
back to a question we had in patrons
asked um last week which is on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus if you
want it or someone asked there's a blank
there blanke solder pads on the
twenty-eighth ETI can i solder GDD our
six module to it and have a 12 gigabyte
card the answer was no and so in that
instance the purposeful limitation is
that the full tu 102 GPU can have 72 SM
so I'll top my head I think that's what
it is and the 20 ATT is 68 and so those
extra SMS also impact how many memory
controllers there are so you're running
with or actually it's it comes out of
TBC's and gbc's as well but for the 28
ET i there are 11 memory controllers one
per module effectively and there can be
a twelfth so if it were a full tu 102
die nothing disabled there could be 12
memory controllers you could have 12
gigabytes of memory or 12 modules I
should say so it's just like the Titan X
where you have a scenario where there's
12 gigabyte card 1080i is 11 and I know
from what one of you actually emailed us
and said that for a while anyway some
deep learning or machine learning
applications really needed the 12
gigabytes memory I think it had to do
with how the workload was split or
something like that for something
popular and so in that instance a 1080i
was not viable they needed either
divisions of 4 gigabytes were exactly 12
gigabytes and that's where the Titan XP
came in so the answer is yes they're
limiting it in so far as disabling parts
of the core will disable memory
controllers which disables your ability
to get more VRAM but also if the cards
weaker it's being used for gaming
blasting out with PRM might not
anyway if you need more actual
processing power first the next product
question socketable GPUs and CPUs or
sorry and like CPUs and socketable dims
so dims like actual sticks are a big
problem you run into like huge latency
concerns with something like existing
DDR Standards and there are issues with
the board space consumed I don't look at
how every single I don't have a PCB in
front of me but this is the size of the
PCB is right and then every single spot
on that board is filled with something
mostly power regulation where you gonna
find the room for slots plus they have
latency issues now you have multiple
cross compatibility issues timings
become a concern because it's not as
heavily manually controlled and so it's
just it's it's not really viable I don't
think we've talked to that before in
previous episodes but primarily comes
down to board real estate complexity of
design circuit traces now are going to
be completely impacted where do you put
your vrm versus where do you put your
memory you want them both to be really
close to the GPU but both those things
are really big so that's problem stuff
like that so I don't think that's gonna
happen soccer ball GPUs they have a hell
of a lot of of solder points on there so
it's it's all I think it's all ball grid
array and if you're working with that I
fitting pins I guess is doable but I
don't know I don't see that happening it
becomes too much of a too complex for
too small real estate next question why
do games have trouble with clipping this
is from freedom four or five five six
you said regarding your gaming graphics
request for console why is it so hard
for game developers to make sure nothing
clips through geometry in games for
example in Mass Effect having weapons on
your back clip through the character
model or in fallout 4
having the pip-boy clip through the
female models forearm during the walking
animation is this just a case of there
being too many permutations to test or
is it just not worth the effort to
resolve a bit of both of those but also
some more so games try to do this but a
lot of games do procedural
placement for the feet to make sure
neither foot clips through the ground
first of all it's possible to resolve
these issues but the last two points you
had of too many points to check each
frame and not worth it to resolve are
part of the reason that it usually is
not resolved most mesh collisions are
simplified to collision boxes or
collision capsules which will just limit
the checks to one volume instead of
multiple verts and if you're able to
customize your weaponry in any game
maybe like Mass Effect not sure then
checking for exact self collisions is
way too expensive in terms of processing
power and would also require a lot of as
you said permutations they would also
need to make slight differences to
custom animations for each of the
weapons in the game to make sure it
doesn't clip instead of making one
animation and swapping out the mesh or
the skeleton for a model for whatever
they need so a lot of those are concerns
also game play is a big point that is
worth discussing because if you're
genuinely gonna stop the players weapon
from colliding with like a wall it will
impact how how close the player can move
to the wall impact how they can walk in
general because now you've got this big
collision box sticking out of you and
you can't you need a boolean to cut that
weapon into pieces to say like like
let's say you wanted to take the
approach of let's allow it to clip
through the wall but not be visible on
the other side like in counter-strike
something like that where if if you turn
and it's a thin wall or a barrel or
something or card or and the weapon goes
through the other player can see it
maybe even shoot it so if you want to
stop that from happening but still allow
a full range of movement and not impact
gameplay you would need a boolean really
expensive to do the basically have to
like tessellated or something cut it
into pieces and figure out which piece
doesn't get drawn so gameplay is part of
it really expensive to do is part of it
and really expensive in terms of
development time is also part of it
because it could be a permutations issue
highly customizable games like Skyrim
for example you'll see that kind of
clipping all the time where capes or
crossbows on the back for mods or
whatever clip through the character part
of that's rigging a lot of it is just
you'd have to redo the animations for
each weapon and that's a lot of work and
then there two more quick ones here so
this one or hee-ho lamp
this this time I brought up just because
the r-tx launched how would you actually
work per day and what kind of work do
you usually do you know these three
times talks about it and seems like you
work a ton also in conjunction to that
what do you or other team members
typically do while working for The Cider
channel so we have pretty fixed
functions Andrew does a lot of the well
almost
almost all the primary like big review
editing filming lights does some 3d
animations for stuff like the RAM
timings we have more of that coming up
soon and also has helped with providing
so the game graphics answers things like
that - because he's a 3d artist Patrick
works on testing so tests the the cases
are almost entirely done with Patrick at
this point writes the reviews we dump
all that into a script do the video so I
take his build notes as you notice in
the the videos take his build notes I'll
modify the thermal section a bit we put
it together and put a big review
together that way also works on on some
other CPU testing things like that then
I work on a bit of everything so overall
figuring out what we want to produce for
content managing it timelines testing
for GPUs primarily testing for coolers
and all of the administrative stuff
that's boring you know accounting all
that stuff so a lot of it answering the
first private question so for RTX that
launch was crazy it was very very poorly
organised by Nvidia as well and the
partners didn't really know what was
going on so that launched over a seven
day period I worked 105 hours but like
still got sleep in there it's just that
there was nothing else except for work
and sleep so typically don't do that
much but for a really important launch
I'll do it and then just slow it down a
bit after that but it's always it's it's
high it's you know it's more than two
full time jobs normally but it's not
quite the same perceptually as working
two full-time jobs because it's one it's
mine I can do what I want and it's also
fun so it's like I mean if you work for
eight hours you go home and you play
games for four hours or something really
that's not too different for what I'm
doing except all twelve of those hours
would be
work technically for me it's just that I
enjoy all 12 hours of it and yeah I
tried to do minimum like 12 14 hours a
day minimum and then push more for
launches stuff like that last one so
this is for a note for the side channel
we maybe drop some footage in here too
but yun viking asked hasty of him also
an avid mountain bike rider or mountain
biker and i wanted to ask what would you
rank as the top three places you've ever
ridden I know you've had opportunities
to ride different downhill parks like
Whistler with a traveling you do also
would there ever be a possibility of a
patreon meetups more like Bailey Bike
Park not sure how many other patrons are
on the East Coast and also enjoy
mountain biking but I think it could be
a cool way for you to interact with your
audience outside of conventions love to
hear thoughts I know that um who is it I
said Seth I think Seth does those bike
meetups I don't have any plans for it
but my top three places I got a list
Taiwan because Taipei is really cool in
general I love it there Taiwan's really
cool and the biking is completely
different so it's it's like way over
growth there way more natural rocky Rudy
terrain so it's it's more Trudi H no
lifts access you got a you got to pedal
it all the way up or a shuttle or
something so that's a lot of fun
I go with the guy who speaks some
English I speak to very little Chinese
so between the two of those things we
can communicate just enough to talk
about like what's coming up on the trail
and he'll normally give me a warning
like like three meters big drop and
that's that's the end of our
communication so it's enough to figure
out what's going on or tell me about a
jump so really like that just because
it's different whistler of course is up
on the top of the list as well it's it's
a gigantic park and then for the third
one
it's alright that's our hard answer
local trails I like chose our local
Santa Cruz I like a lot but it's a lot
of push and then there's also a mammoth
I love riding mammoths like recoil and
Twilight Zone there's a really good
trails especially with the wall ride so
I'm gonna go with probably the trail I
can't remember the name of in Taiwan in
Taiwan and then Whistler and then let's
go with maybe Mammoth
kind of tied with Bryce in Virginia for
the the top ones snow she's pretty good
but it's a huge pain to get to so that
kills a lot of it and then the side
channel will have more of that hopefully
soon I'm trying to set up the old studio
it's a better allow for production of
some bike content over there so that's
the GN Steve side channel go and check
that out
thanks for watching as always leave your
questions below for next week subscribe
for more go to patreon.com/scishow and
exes to get access to the bonus sgn
episode and then I don't know who knows
maybe we'll do a bike meetup someday but
probably not and then I think that's
okay I stored that camera's access not
net to pick up one of our products and
hopes that directly that you're watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
