into with the GTX 1060 hybrid build
after part 2 this is a quick update
showing how I think we're gonna resolve
its this coverage is brought to you by
MSI and their new GTX 1060 gaming X
which has the aforementioned Twin Frozr
6 cooler so I filed down the edges of
this basically socket on the base plate
and that was done because this
protrusion on the copper cold plate of
the EVGA cooler would not fit in there
but then shortly after that I had
another problem we did have to remove
the thermal paste again because of
what's about to happen here
this was not making full contact so we
actually only got partial coverage and
you can tell actually by looking at the
thermal paste so obviously we can't see
down in there very well and because we
can't see in there very well the there's
no good way to see if there's contact
being made other than to pull the thing
off and look at the die and see what the
thermal paste coverage is and it was not
a lot it was only on the very edges so
when I turn this thing on I notice
there's a problem because idle
temperatures were pretty high and we
just shut it down immediately pulled it
apart and found out that it wasn't was
making full contact and that's just
because the GPU die doesn't have enough
height to come up so that it's over
whatever threshold this was called blade
is meeting halfway between the socket
and the protrusion so there's some space
in there so I bought a bunch of these
these are shims that are actually
labeled on take a bottom on Amazon
they're labeled as shims for GPS and
CPUs and there's a lot of them out there
so the goal here basically thermal paste
will go on either side and then this
shim will sit right there and then we'll
seal it down really with this stuff if
the manual does recommend using half the
tube for each application we've only got
half the tube left the lights are
blinding me so I'm gonna use most of it
here we can be a bit generous it'll
spread out we should be good to go
that's actually
it's actually a little bit under what
the manual calls for but I'll do that
for now let me see if I can actually
like siphon some of this into the tube
that would be pretty sweet that actually
work oh man that is awesome okay so I
think until we get the tool to really do
a circle pattern we can just fill this
up which is pretty sweet let's try this
out I'm only gonna put a little bit
extra on here else it just spits a ton
of it out all at once oh it's working
nice okay well that's a lot of thermal
paste but whatever doesn't matter it so
you either put it on here first or on
the cold plate I think we're gonna put
it on there it seems like it's got a
pretty good hold in a perfect world you
have perfectly flat surfaces of copper
in such an environment it would actually
be worse to use thermal paste basically
there's microscopic imperfections in the
surface and those are filled with
thermal paste which will eliminate air
pockets yep that's it okay so there we
have it this thing's actually on there
now I can see plain and clear that the
protrusion looks to be making contact
with the shim the copper xem so now
there's one of these in there between
the cold plate we've got some thermal
paste on it I also discovered I was able
to siphon thermal paste into this tube
which makes me tremendously happy that's
my that's my favorite discovery out of
this project now so I'll put the rest of
this on we're not gonna show it cuz we
already did that in episode 2 you missed
episode two and one check those out for
the teardown on Episode one or part one
that will show you the internals of the
card part two shows the process that
looks like it goes exceedingly smoothly
until it doesn't and this which is not
really part three but more of DLC add-on
shows the the issue we encountered
in parts two and three so check back
subscribe if you want to see part three
where we'll have actual thermal results
with testing and data and stuff like
that it may be an extra few days but
it'll be out in the next few days for
sure by Monday so thank you for watching
pay traveling to the post or video if
you want to helps out directly
subscribe and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
