Intel launched 28 core 5 gigahertz CPU
by the end of the year Intel's 28 core 5
gigahertz CPU coming in quarter 4 shut
up and take my money Intel it's all
 before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 expectations are
impossibly high for this 28 core CPU
literally impossible by the way because
there's no way that thin does 5
gigahertz if you look at the photos of
the Dominus motherboard and look closely
at the socket screw locations it's clear
that Intel was running a socket P
motherboard with an LGA
36:47 pin out that's the same as the
xeon motherboards and it's clear that
intel has taken an existing xeon grade
processor and repositioned it as a
desktop part this 28 core cpu isn't new
and in fact it's probably almost
certainly an Intel 81 76 platinum or an
eighty 180 probably the 81 76 the 81 76
is a skylake X part Intel was severely
misleading and its technical
demonstration of a 5 gigahertz / Clark
there's a fake I don't know why I did
that and it's a 28 core CPU they said it
those 5 gigahertz notice something they
didn't disclose the cooling solution
that's because of chiller
it was a chiller behind the scenes and
the chiller had the CPU at sub ambien
negative 10 degrees Celsius to achieve 5
gigahertz it's not some new
next-generation architecture in fact
what they are overclocking was a sky
like X CPU with 28 cores and guess what
existing skylake X CPUs like the 790 DX
e with 18 cores don't really do 5
gigahertz that easily especially not on
ambient cooling so this was severe
misleading to have a chiller behind the
scenes pushing five gigahertz no
disclosure of cooling whatsoever and
suddenly you've got every press website
in the world saying Intel's next-gen
twenty eight core CPU does five
gigahertz no it doesn't it's 2.7
gigahertz base and boost we'd be shocked
if it's more than four gigahertz stock
you might be able to overclock to four
gigahertz maybe a bit beyond but let's
look at the existing data with a 79 80
XE doing 4.6 4.7 gigahertz that's pretty
common without a deal it'd without
liquid metal without exotic cooling what
Intel's presenting is none of those
things they have not presented anything
resembling reality with the 28 court in
reality it's a severely overclocked via
sub ambient chiller cooling solution
that is just not going to realize in any
meaningful way that you can use and all
the headlines are misleading you that is
the result of intel's press event let's
go to 79 80 XE 18 cores overclocked to
let's say 4.9 gigahertz we did it with a
d lid with liquid metal with exotic sort
of cooling and it was drawing more than
600 watts what do you think a 28 cords
gonna do it's got 10 more cores and the
only difference between the 28 core
desktop part and the 28 core Xeon part
is the Xeon part has ECC memory and the
desktop part some reason doesn't so at
$9,000 for the Xeon part you're probably
looking at it closer to $3,000 for the
desktop part Intel's once again
cannibalizing their own product line and
their own user base to go down to a
desktop part out of panic to compete
with Andy's thread Ripper 2
this is clearly a last-minute change in
response to threat Ripper - in evidence
of being a last-minute change Intel even
pulled demonstrations of overclocking as
28 core CPU from the show floor at
Computex what better place to show it
than there and they pull the demos what
does that tell you it's all last minute
scrambled change panicked in response to
threader / - and there's absolutely no
way they can cool this thing at 5
gigahertz even lower frequencies would
be extremely difficult for a consumer to
cool this is all very clearly a
last-minute thing and it's not even a
CPU that can operate within reason at
the headlines of 5 gigahertz that have
been posted everywhere the headlines are
factually inaccurate if they say it's a
5 gigahertz 28 core CPU in what world
can skylake axe do 5 gigahertz with 28
chords without Ellen - or a chiller
which is what they used so it's very
misleading and the fact that all the
headlines have taken this and run with
it as if it's a 5 gigahertz stock CPU is
it laughable because it's like you don't
even think about for a second what
you're saying so this thing chiller
below negative 10 degrees Celsius for
ambient temperature the CPU itself with
overclocking
probably still in the 50s or something
like that
it's sky like axe after all and as far
as the rest it's basically a giant epen
contest between AMD and intel who just
keep doing we have more cores than the
other guy we have more frequencies than
the other one or we added 100 digits to
our chipset name so that the number is
bigger and then in the case of Andy also
we cancelled the chipset because I guess
the idea wasn't all caught on to the
game started doing the same thing and
now the game's not fun anymore
but the Intel Core I whatever 28 core
CPU which is a clearly Xeon part that
has been taken from the workstation or
Xeon group and branded as a desktop part
just seems like it's completely a
response to thread Ripper to trying to
steal the Thunder for Computex and
somehow they even failed at that
because thread rapport - was announced
in the middle of the show which seems
like a total miss play by Andy except
for the fact that the 28th Corps was
shown before threader / - so in a world
where launching a product a high-end one
in the middle of a trade show makes
absolutely no sense it's somehow come
together for this one and at the end of
the day we're left with a scenario where
Intel is just misleading everybody with
their product and we don't even know if
it'll be a real product but it's
certainly in its present form skylake
acts and that's not a new thing and the
higher core count isn't all that
impressive it can't reach anywhere close
to the advertised frequencies that they
showed in the demo even with
overclocking it's all very misleading
and that's pretty disappointing so Intel
you get the worst of sure ward thank you
very much for participating your efforts
were admirable any do take home the
prize we'll see you all next time
subscribe for more as always go to
patreon.com/scishow and razaaq's it
helps out directly cuz we'll probably
need it after this video I did hit my
head a few times after all go to store
die karen sexist on hats become a mod
mat and check back for more comedy talks
