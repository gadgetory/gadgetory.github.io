don that and we're here at kingston and
the HyperX suites at CES 2016 today
we're looking at the new revolver a
headset this is a follow-on to the cloud
and cloud too but before that all this
content is brought to you by I by powers
revolt to small form-factor gaming PC so
the revolver headset is the one here
beside me and this is a bit different
from the cloud and the cloud two
headsets if you've seen those previously
with this one the most noticeable change
is the suspension headband design so
that's sort of familiar to users the
steelseries headsets like the Siberia
for example so it's got a suspension
headband design which is basically two
metal bars up here and then the headband
itself moves up and down as you fit the
headset the drivers are 50 millimeter
drivers we don't know a whole lot about
the diaphragm technology or anything
like that right now don't know the
diaphragm material but we know that they
are 50 millimeter drivers and that the
ear cups are closed back ear cops for
this headset and the sound stage is
pretty wide so it should be beneficial
to users who are playing more FPS style
games this particular headset next to me
is not dobby or 3d surround any type of
technology enabled so it's just a
standard stereo headset and this is in
the range of 120 dollars when it's
launched it's not final just yet kinston
and hyper acts are targeting a cue to
launch the other headset is the revolver
s which is a surround headset that does
have the dolby tech and in line and the
inline dongle there's a toggle for the
Dolby Surround technology as well as a
up down volume button for the headset
and for the microphone input levels so
that's pretty much all that we know
right now other than I suppose
convention that microphones attached
well like the previous two headsets but
beyond that we'll have to look at more
detailed specifications as review time
approaches if you like this type of
coverage as always hit the link in the
description below for more information
on this headset or information on all
the other stuff we've covered here at
CES in the past few days and check that
patreon link the postural video if you
want to help us out directly I will see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
