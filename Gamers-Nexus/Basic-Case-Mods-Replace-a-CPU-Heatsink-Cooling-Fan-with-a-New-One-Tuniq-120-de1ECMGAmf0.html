Nexus dotnet and we're doing something a
little bit different today we're going
to replace the CPU after the aftermarket
CPU heatsink
fan in this - nique 120 extreme or -
Niek tower 120 extreme cooler is for LGA
1155 1366 and I think it fits AMD
sockets as well you just need a special
mounting bracket that it comes with so
I'm going to be replacing the fan in
here it came with a really nice blue fan
but I want to put in my red fan to match
the rest of my case the blue fan is 80
CFM at 19 decibels so I tried to match
that as best I could I think I got a 76
CFM fan at about the same decibel level
so it's not a huge performance decrease
but for the gain that it fits the rest
of my cases theme it was worth the 1
percent drop in cooling now we're first
going to start removing the fan you just
unscrew the 4 corner screws just like I
did and then you slide this out and
that's your mounting bracket with these
the fan itself take note of which way
the fan is facing note the way the fins
are dipped that way you can make sure
you put your new fan in the correct
direction because it does sort of matter
you want to push all the hot air up and
out or up and out the back and not back
down towards your video card which is
what will happen if it's the wrong
direction I believe depending on which
way it mounts it might also push it
towards the front where your hard drives
are just again depending on which way
you mount it so now we're going to take
the fan itself out and this takes me a
little bit of time to do this brand new
so they're tight and I just alternate
corners nothing new here we're all
capable of doing this just alternate
corners with the screwdriver to apply
equal pressure and then you'll
eventually get the fan out and once that
fan is out I'm still unscrewing it here
once that fan is out we can get going
with the new fan so I'm going to put
this aside and keep it for later because
again it is a very good fan at 80 CFM
and 19 decibels that's not super common
at a at a budget point so I'm going to
keep it for a blue case later and let's
see I'm almost done here there we go got
the fan out so now that hopefully you
have noted which direction it was facing
we can set that aside and of course my
video shows you the default
action and phases so that will that will
help you if you mess up and forget which
way it was pointed and now we're going
to put this new fan in so the first
thing to note here it is a little bit
tricky you want to make sure I mess this
up my first time here but you want to
make sure that your cables for the fan
itself are facing out meaning out of the
top area the top oriented from the way
it was standing a second ago make sure
they're facing out that way they come
out of the bottom of the heatsink once
you put it back in so I figure this out
right around now and flip it around yep
there we go and after this you just want
to make sure it's really secure they'll
screw those four screws back in just one
on each bottom left top right corner for
each side and alternate that way it has
the best strength because it is a
spending object so you just want to make
sure it's in there secure don't strip
anything but make sure it's secure and
here we go I have it in now with the
cable facing downward and we're going to
screw that in really quickly this pretty
boring to watch screws going in so I'll
speed it up a little bit
that way it's it's not quite so slow
here and uh so we get this thing in I
want to say really quick I do have a lot
more hardware guides coming up I'm
actually going to be doing a review a
video review hopefully of the Roseville
Thor version two wide edition case which
is a full tower case I believe it's
pretty cool looking
it is a white edition case so it's
something that something new I'm used to
black cases as are many of us and I'm
going to be reviewing that soon on the
channel I also plan to do I follow how
to build your computer guide because a
lot of people have really been asking
for it and even an overclocking guide
which is what this heatsink guide is in
preparation for because I do plan to do
some overclocking guides in the very
near near future
every board is going to be different of
course but we'll worry about that when
we get to it so now we see that I have
the fan mounted I do a quick test to see
which way the air is going up but this
is a very good test or anything but just
a quick test and there's your mounting
location
and we'll just push feed the cable
through there and out the other side and
then you can mount your fan back where
it belongs don't force it too hard push
it a little bit and then maneuver the
cable as necessary and of course we have
that in it's just back to screen in the
original top four screws from the start
of the video so we'll screw those in and
then that's really it you're done at
this point so please like the video
comment and subscribe comments if you
need any help at all we're always here
to help you or go to our forums we're
there to help you as well we have a lot
of people on volunteer staff or on staff
to answer questions so give us a shout
you can also post on our Twitter and
Facebook page which are in the
description below and of course you can
see me microing my screws like crazy
right now I'm basically just going at it
like a zergling rush or something so we
get those in everything's mounted we're
good to go
let again let us know if you have any
questions at all like subscribe comment
and we'll see you guys next time peace
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
