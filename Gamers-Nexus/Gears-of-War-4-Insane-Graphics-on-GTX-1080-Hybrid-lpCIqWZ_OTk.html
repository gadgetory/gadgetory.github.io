maximum settings as running on an EVGA
GTX 1080 hybrid card the FTW model that
we recently reviewed this is the highest
performing GPU that we presently have in
the lab and we're running as you can see
a frame rate on the side anywhere from
60 to 80 FPS depend on if we're at 4
1080 or 1440 or whatever struggles a bit
at 4k with these particular settings we
have insane enabled for SSR and do f
which is really a bit unnecessarily
abusive so you'll see an hour benchmark
which is already live that if you lower
the settings to just ultra or hi this is
really no problem at all in terms of
gameplay and FPS and eighteen sixty is
really not trouble for this particular
graphics card we've got the whole
benchmark for that already but what to
discuss here is this is what the game
looks like at its max quality settings
now the benchmark course in particular
for this game is intensive is very
replicable and works well to test cards
however visually it is not that
impressive when you're looking at it in
person and probably on the screen now
but if we look at scenes from throughout
the game the non benchmark scenes they
do generally tend to look a bit better
than this although they might actually
be less abusive or about the same level
of strain on the hardware the reason for
that is really just because the
benchmark serves one purpose it is to
generate enough load on all system
resources GPU cpu and vram which this
game tax is very heavily by the way for
the most part and generate load there
and then for the actual game you know
you'll be performing within or below
that range in terms of what the the card
and the cpu can handle for your system
so when looking at the game itself
throughout single-player campaign
generally the aesthetic will be a bit
more interesting than this dark scene
with the cars flying around the silly
rag dolls and generally also the sort of
image quality as a whole is improved
throughout the game but the benchmark
seen still works well and everything
we've tested here has been resulting lee
performance in the actual single-player
campaign
and so really no no issue there in terms
of changing image quality you don't see
a big hit to your performance if it
performs well in the badge market will
perform well in the single-player
campaign for the most part so that is it
this is the game at max settings if you
want to see the benchmarks where we test
several GPS I don't know how many we
actually were to custom Python scripts
for this particular benchmark because we
had to because it is d X 12 and that
means that some of our normal tools
don't work so if thanks to gns Carter
Harris we've got a script for that is in
production and used now for the most
recent benchmark so check that out hey
chamaca personal video helps i directly
as always subscribe for more content
thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
