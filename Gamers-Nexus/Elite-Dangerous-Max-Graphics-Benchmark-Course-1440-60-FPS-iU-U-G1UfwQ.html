donna and today i'm showing you our
benchmark course for elite dangerous a
new space sim and spaceflight combat
game to the tune of a slightly different
version of star citizen so it is not
quite what star citizen wants to be but
elite dangerous is out now and it's got
a smaller scope so in many ways this can
be preferable for some players and
certainly being available that was a big
help so the game is out we benchmarked
it this is the benchmark course that I
ran I ran the game on maximum settings
and I even tested SMAA versus four times
MLA or mlpa whatever it was called and
the difference is really minimal between
anti-aliasing options so I did run it at
max settings with the 4x setting and
performance is pretty good overall I've
got a full GPU benchmark linked in the
description below and also on the screen
at some point and everything ran pretty
well you can check the article for all
the benchmark charts I'll try to do a
video on this later but for now what
you're looking at is the benchmark
course we ran and I was a 120 second
course for elite dangerous just looking
at a space station and sort of flying
around document undocking the game looks
great it's not very GPU intensive but
it's certainly still good looking unlike
some of the other games I've benchmarked
recently there really aren't any major
technological advancements in graphics
here Nvidia and Andy did not unveil any
new fur tech or anything crazy like that
it's just it's a space simulator there's
some cool graphics for the planets that
look really pretty gorgeous and the
spaceships are just high resolution
textures and it's an interior of a ship
so it's nothing too crazy but the game
still looks good and I encourage you to
check out the benchmark linked in the
description below if you are interested
in this content and overall it really
looks like you could play this on just
about any GQ that's budget or better
class if you're on an ultra tight budget
then you're going to struggle a bit more
you definitely will be playing it on max
but it's it's a fairly well optimized
game so that is all for this time and I
will see you all next time peace
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
