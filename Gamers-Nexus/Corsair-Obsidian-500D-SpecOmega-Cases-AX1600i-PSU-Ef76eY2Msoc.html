Coursera suite now looking at a couple
of new cases they also have power supply
that's worth the mention at least so the
case mainly that we're targeting I was
the 500d there is also a new case in the
spec line of cases though for the
obsidian 500d this one should be
somewhat familiar to you all because we
reviewed the 570 X when it came out a
little while ago this has a lot of 570 X
tooling so if you liked that tooling
you're probably already partway there on
this case before that this coverage is
brought to you by Thermaltake and the
flow liquid cooler the flow is a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
with three ring RGB LED fans you can
program the fans our custom lighting
through software and then of course
benefit from the larger radiator size
and cooling performance learn more at
the link in the description below a
couple of things to point out though
four changes would include the tops had
a bit of a change so in terms of
radiator support it's easier to get a
280 up there now the clearance between
the top of the motherboard and the top
of case is a little bit thicker so that
should help out a bit previously it was
about a 240 was kind of where you
stopped so this one goes to 80 and
previously also there was more of an
offset than there is now other than that
there are two versions of 500e that I
should point out this is the aluminum
front version obviously tempered glass
there's a price difference and there's
also a fan spec difference the fan spec
difference is this one comes with three
RGB fans that one comes with two SP fans
the price difference is about $100 150
versus 250 part of that's the fans and
then part of that is going to be
tempered glass because tempered glass
has a bit more price involved with it
when you're bending it like this because
of yields so those are things to know
about the two different versions kind of
smaller but cool features this door that
I keep opening actually is somewhat from
the concept slate that we saw at
Computex previously that gigantic
40-pound case if anyone remembers that
one so these are inspired or partly
pulled from that some of the tooling is
pulled from the five 70 X they're all
bits and pieces that you should somewhat
recognize the front of the power supply
shroud can be removed by screws so if
you wanted to ventilate that or route
your cables differently or whatever you
can remove that
front power-supply shroud cover it's
also got a vertical GPU mount so of
course there's getting on board that
train with everyone else at this point
the vertical GPU mount basically the
same as we've seen in the past mounted
with cup two expansion slots in the back
sits vertically right up against the
glass and then for the extension cable
or for the riser cable you need to buy
your own so BYO riser cable in this case
Corsair may look into that in the future
they do products with riser cables it's
just riser cables are actually kind of
hard to get the right ones because there
are some performance issues with the
cheaper riser cable so you have to buy
your own for that for now other than
that I think that that covers the
majority of the case really it's it's
not it's not too different from a mix of
all the other things we've seen in the
past but it's a it's a good stout mid
Tower I guess that's what you're looking
for backside does have slightly
different hard drive cages than
previously now you can mount the hard
drives in either orientation if you want
the PCB exposed or the metal plate
exposed so very small chains but one
that's worth noting as well and I think
we can probably move on to the new spec
series case and take a look at that
although I'll just quickly point out the
airflow here so airflow on this one
we've been talking about air flow
non-stop for this case you do have about
an inch on the side of the front panel
for breathing which is what we typically
recommend from our testing so that's
good pass that test there's no bottom
intake hole on this one no top intake
hole it's just the front i/o for the top
i/o up here with a USB type-c first case
that course is done with that and yeah
so we'll see how how cooling doesn't
testing but they do have a decent amount
of room here and there's nothing really
behind the fans there's no cages or
anything like that so it may very well
be okay let's move on to the next case
so the next case this is a bit cheaper
at a hundred dollars this one you might
recognize a bit for two reasons this
front has been on at least one other
corsair case you may remember this spec
Alfa we looked at that ages ago so it's
a bit of the spec Alfa front and then
the internal is a 460 X which we saw it
packs a little while ago as well
least a year not more so yeah 460 x+
spec alpha basically is what you get in
terms of fan support it has an SPL II D
fan on the front and just a blackout fan
on the back and it's got an LED bar in
the bottom front as well so basically
spec alpha + 460 X and that's the start
in the end of this one so last one we're
gonna talk about is a high end power
supply and I'm only gonna give a
top-level overview of some of the
changes here we don't presently
specialize in power supplies so I'm
gonna I'll give you the basics
it's an ax 1600 I it's 100 watts more
than the previous model and it will go
through the basic aesthetic stuff first
it does come with a couple of different
magnetic labels if you want there's $450
in terms of the more technical stuff I'm
not going to dive too deep on so the
main change I've been told about is I
guess the PFC components that the
transistors that comprise the PFC the
power factor correction component
typically our silicon and from what I
understand these silicon transistors
have an efficiency of something like 94
to 95 percent in a typical power supply
that's not for the entire load of the
power spice you're not talking 94-95 of
1600 watts under full load you're
talking 94 to 95 percent of the PFC
transistors what they're doing here is
using gallium nitrite which is
apparently 99% efficient for that
specific component I guess the
potentially more significant thing or at
least more noticeable thing externally
is that it shaves off about 20
millimeters on the power supply length
and in terms of other stuff that I do
know more about unfortunate I have specs
on so the PCIe gauge for example I don't
know the 12 volt gauge on that wire
which is definitely something we care
about with although the modding we've
done if the Titan V lately but yeah
that's that's all I know about this one
so we'll move on but $450 for the ax
1600 I we've got the two cases that we
showed or three if you count B variants
with the aluminum panel 500 d a glass
panel 500 E and then the spec Omega so
that's the Corsair suite at CES 2018 as
always you can check links in the
description below for more information
they also had a keyboard and mouse that
we talked about previously couple days
ago subscribe for more you go to
