our bench since the thorough lashing we
gave it about two years ago with one of
the 980 extreme cards and it's thanks to
a reader who has loaned us his card for
testing the zotac 1080i app Xtreme is a
full quarter inch larger than one of the
next largest cards out the asus strix
and it's a nearly an inch larger than a
two slot card so the amp Xtreme is one
of the biggest cards out there that you
can get and you would hope that that is
somehow affording a benefit to cooling
so we'll be testing that shortly but
first we're doing a teardown of the card
to see how it's constructed how the
transfer is from the fetch the vram all
that to the actual massive aluminum
heatsink and ultimately looking at the
quality of design as a whole and seeing
if buying a bigger card is in fact
better and in the past that's not always
the case before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by EVGA and
their 1080p is c2 which we've
recommended fairly highly for its build
quality and the icx sensors which are
kind of fun to play with you can check
our full sc2 review for the 1080i if
you're curious to learn more or you can
click the link in the description below
to find the product page for the 1080p
is c2 though tag has taken the
brute-force approach to pretty much
everything on the amp extreme 1080i
especially in the cooling dept by using
a massive cooler
they've taken a brute-force approach to
the VRM by using a 16 phase vrm that
we'll talk about that more later and
they even got to eight pins and then a
three fan setup so we're going to take
it apart and see how everything looks
internally and before making any further
judgments and then we'll have the full
review separately probably one to two
days after this goes up but let's start
with the teardown first so the back side
of the card standard layout here there
are four spring tension screws that are
the standard ones youth and all of the
10a TTI's for the most parts on them are
a bit special but so far not too
different these hold the coldplay and
probably the entire large aluminum mass
to the PCB and then we've got an extra
screw up here
just probably just for extra support
because again really heavy card I mean I
haven't waited but it's the heaviest one
that we've had in hand I think that's it
it's five screws and then these are all
on the other side so these you can see
that they are screw points or the
opposite side of the card probably under
the PCB or on the PCB side so let's see
if this is loose yet it is okay let's
hold them me down alright got it
okay so we're cleaning the thermal paste
off first
there's your copper cold plate and let's
take a look at let's start with the
thermal pad ignoring the thermal paste
that's on there so we've got the green
thermal pads for vram contact and this
is the first 1080i for those who have
been keeping track that we've taken
apart that is missing a different module
so that's kind of interesting every
other 1080i we've seen has been missing
this vram module which seems more it
seemed like a a constant but now we've
got the bottom-left one missing instead
so that's just kind of interesting but
not actually functionally that different
so for the throne pads we've got contact
here on those and we have contact on the
memory vrm so here's your memory vrm
this block right here with the
indentation being used for the chokes
and let me disconnect the rest of this
so that we have more freedom to move it
around
these are RGB and power headers this
one's for the backplate it looks like
yes those for the backplate this one's
going to be a little more difficult to
remove safely okay there we go so you
just pull it out by the white header
rather than the cables and we've got it
separated now let's take a look at the
vrm coin so there's a an aluminum plate
here that's thinned for vrm cool and
this is on top of the MOSFETs we'll look
at those in a moment
a minute ignoring the thermal paste all
over my hand so that's covering the
MOSFETs the doublers which there are
definitely doublers in there and then
this is contacting the underlying
components by a green thermal pad which
isn't too visible but maybe you can see
that so there's a green thermal pad in
there contacting the core vrm components
let's flip that around and then for this
one we have a a not thermal pad this
looks like a rubber damper and or bumper
if I push on it yeah check that out can
we get this can you see that if I push
on it you'll see the service kind of
deform but return to where it is that
shows you this is Robert this is not a
thermal pad and I mean I can feel it by
pushing on it you can feel what a
thermal pad is very clearly and let's
just show on one of these the different
so if you look at this one over here we
can push down on this in a corner see
how it leaves an indentation so that's
not happening here on this this is
rubber the reason this would exist I
suppose is if they are trying to damp
the vibration of which there would be
none really I mean we've got a massive
three fan cooler if you have vibration
at this point there's a serious flaw in
the design so that's my guess that's
probably too damp vibration between the
thin stack and the vrm heat sink if they
were to rub against one another now the
reason this is potentially very dumb I'm
just confirming here yeah even if I pick
up the edges it doesn't move so it is
actually just glued on rubber and is
there a metal plate in there no no it's
actually just Robert it's not like a
plate under it so the reason this
doesn't make a lot of sense what we'll
see in testing once we get to it
is because you've got it completely
isolated vrm heatsink and that's kind of
okay it works sometimes especially when
you have a plate that's split in half
for example completely isolated BRM
heatsink stuck between the hottest
component on the board the chokes are
the inductors and on top of the next
hottest components the BAS fads with no
transfer whatsoever to the heatsink this
giant piece of aluminum and copper is
not being leveraged here to cool the VXR
it's not there's no contact so the only
way you get any cooling is really from
the air getting pushed down from these
fans into the fin stack for the vrm and
that is somewhat blocked by this not a
lot but this happens to be exactly where
the vrm heatsink is and it's blocking
any kind of air penetration through the
larger fin stack and further for some
reason they just didn't do a thermal pad
there and that's something that maybe we
can test in our review is to Navy remove
this thing put a thermal pad on there
and see if it improves I bet you it
probably would but we've tested that
with the AC X cards in the past and saw
that even a thermal pad connecting fins
like this with no base plate just the
small amount of surface area you get
there a thermal pad contacting those
fins to another part of the heatsink was
actually an improvement on the AC X card
so that doesn't mean it'll be an
improvement here but it's worth trying
and this will be very interesting to see
how it unfolds in testing but there's no
real functional reason to have this year
as a vibration damping pad assuming they
designed their card correctly because
it's so huge and it's a three fan cooler
anyway so it shouldn't really vibration
should not be a concern you're not
spinning fast enough and you're not
putting enough torque at weird angles to
cause vibration but no thermal has a
very odd choice so we'll look into that
for the rest of the cooler though we
have a copper plate as expected for the
GPU and then we have one two three four
five six heat pipes that let's see where
they're going
these look like sixes maybe eight yes I
think we have a few of each in here so
we've got three
coming through the coldplay area and
going into the that would be the right
half of the heatsink which is going over
the chokes and the vrm without any
contact whatsoever to either of those
things not that you need to contact the
inductors because they're kind of
self-contained heat sinks anyway and
then the other three heat pipes one of
them comes through wraps around here and
uses the left half of the heat sink and
then the other to wrap under it and come
through to this half the heat sink so a
fairly standard design in that regard
you can see the edges of them there
nothing too special with that design so
that's the bulk of the cooler then
moving on to the rest of the card
let's get the get the backplate off so
backplate is held on by the cables which
have been disconnected and then by some
screws that go through as we showed
earlier okay is it loose yes there's a
video card there's our backplate so
let's let's start with the backplate and
get to the PCB last for the backplate we
have what appears to be a metal or metal
like material but I think this might be
metal this part here the part that
confuses me about this is if you flip it
and look here we have very clearly a
strong difference a stark contrast
between these two materials so what's
going on well this looks like a metal
and this does not this is glossy so it's
either the thickest paint in the world
or it's a different material and I bet
if we look at the edges yet
so if you can see this I don't know how
let's try and get a the overhang so if
you look down here
there's a bit of an overhang between the
backing material which is clearly deeper
and kind of the depth buffer so to speak
the adhesive back there and the rest of
the plate now if we flip it back over we
can show probably that yes you could in
fact peel this material up if you wanted
to you see that I'm not going to peel it
off it's not my card to do so with but
you can see that it's it's a nut
adhesive I don't know why it's there I'm
I am genuinely uncertain as to why that
exists you're never going to see that
side of card maybe it's like to prevent
I don't know it doesn't make contact
with the back anyway because got these
standoffs so even if they were concerned
about bridging contacts it looks like
kind of a non-issue especially if they
use like a proper design anyway but yeah
so we've got a weird plastic coating
here that's not going to help with
cooling certainly it might act as a bit
of a hotbox we'll test it this cable
goes to an LED right here so that is an
RGB digital LED and we might have b-roll
of that in review but that's a digital
LED now let's get back to the PCB see if
there's anything on the backside first
not really some capacitors behind the
GPU all normal stuff but we've got two
screws for the vrm heatsink
two screws okay and two more screws for
that one but let's start here
okay so again by the way talking about
the indentations earlier on that rubber
one another clear sign that something's
not a thermal pad is you can see all the
indents for all the components on it and
we can see that on the other one but
that's the there's review vrm heatsink
and let's look at this insane setup now
so this is the actual vrm there's your
core via ramage mm v RM so going by what
we know of these these are according to
build Zoid it's impossible or at least
very hard to find data sheets for the
fats that they're using and that means
it's hard to do a full in-depth analysis
what we do know is that ZOTAC is using
what looks to be a rebrand of the qn
3100 series so qm 3107 and qn 3103 and
they're using a voltage controller the u
p 951 one an eight phase-- mode going
into eight doublers for sixteen phases
so one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen
fourteen you know maybe he means 14 plus
two what's under here
none more so having pulled this heatsink
off which was a bit of a hidden grouping
of two more phases if I understand this
correctly what I'm seeing with the with
the help of build Zoid is the QN 3:103
is this line here and on the Q + 3 107
3100 series is this line here and also
this one and then we have more we have
two more sets of 3 103 s and 3 107's
here and what it looks like it amounts
to is a 16 phase vrm that's being
doubled just as he said through the u p9
v 1 1 controller in a phase mode we end
up with this huge thing and you've got
your memory RM over here and that more
or less wraps off what we know of the
board today I don't think there will be
a further vrm analysis of this one or
anything like that normally we do those
but speaking with builds why he does our
v RM and PCP analysis of these boards
normally it sounds like it's hard to get
the data sheets because of the fats are
rebranded this discrete fat so I'm not
sure we'll be able to go further than
that but we can do testing overclocking
thermals and maybe gaming performance so
it will focus on thermals and
overclocking and see how this card does
and then hopefully do some cool a B or
ABC test where we remove things like the
back plate see if this is actually just
a hot box and maybe test removing that
rubber atrocity I love here M heat sink
or a top it anyway so these two are
supposed to sandwich together and
actually we noticed separately that they
don't even make full contact so even as
a vibration damping thing it doesn't do
a whole lot we have a photo of that that
shows it better than the video can but
when the card is together in a single
piece
it doesn't make contact with that plate
anyway it's not there all bad but it's
awesome
doing anything other than maybe
obstructing airflow and it could be a
thermal pad so we'll pass that we'll see
how it is before committing too much
