hardcore overclocking here and today
we're going to be taking a look at the
features of the x2 99 dark motherboard
so let's get right into it starting with
the memory slot layout so this board is
as you can clearly see only equipped
with four dimm slots for your RAM and
the reason why this is actually a really
cool feature for at least extreme
overclockers and just competitive
overclockers in general you can be
competitive on water cooling as well the
reason why this is a cool feature is
that with the reduced number of memory
slots the memory traces are shorter
because the slots are physically closer
to the CPU socket they're also better
lay it out because there's not as many
traces necessary to like there's not as
many traces that need to be routed for
the two memory slots instead of four and
the other thing is that a lot of the
actual traces between between two memory
slots on the same memory Channel are
actually shared before that this video
is brought to you by Thermaltake and the
view 71 enclosure the view 71 is a full
tower case that's capable of fitting
three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below this unoccupied
memories law actually introduces a lot
of signal integrity issues for the
memory slot that is occupied and it
actually negatively impacts your memory
overclocking performance so thanks to
the fact that EVGA has this you know one
memory slot per memory channel layout
which is the same thing as what you
would find on other you know
top-of-the-line
extreme overclocking targeted boards
like the Azeroth cozy formula as well as
the Asus Rampage 6 apex this board is
capable of doing things like this right
here and what is this well this is a
screen shot that I take a took of memory
of basically a geek
run that I did and mostly what the focus
was was just memory tuning I didn't
really hammer the CPU that much even
though four point eight six gigahertz on
the fourteen core CPU as it's pretty
significant the CPU was peaking at about
500 Watts know all 500 Watts 550 watts
actual CPU power CPU heat output
thermals weren't great but this was just
basically a quick benchmark run and the
board handled it just fine but more
importantly for me the board does 19
1966 megahertz so this is ddr4 that
frequency right there translates to ddr4
39 33 and look at those timings that's
12 not CL 12 11 11 26 240 so basically
these are these are memory settings that
you would expect from like I did you
know the rampage 6 apex or the OSI
formula which actually the OSI formula
doesn't clock for me at least as high as
the dark does so EVGA has done a really
really good job with this board that
memory layout absolutely works there are
very very few motherboards out there
that can do this on X 299 there are very
few motherboards on Z 217 Z 370 that can
do these kinds of settings so it is
really impressive that you know EVGA has
pulled this off and this is in quad
channel so the memory layout that EVGA
is using is definitely working now
here's a screenshot of a similar
scenario except this one is from Lumi
who is the number-one overclocker in
finland and he got his ram all the way
to ddr4 4120 at basically the same
memory timing so he's still running that
12 1111 28 while I was running 26 but 40
RAF's but he's still doing you know 4000
and 120 mega ticks per second at 1211
11:28 memory timings which is like this
is
there there's there's a very short list
of motherboards out like on the market
that can do these kinds of settings
regardless of what platform you're
looking at so yeah EVGA is decision to
go with the low memory slot count now we
have here definitely paid off that this
board is seriously impressive when it
comes to memory overclocking thanks to
the memory slot layout that it comes
with now then let's move on to some of
the more like features you can actually
sort of feel and see not just not ones
that affect your overclocking kinda in
the background so you have a power
button you have a reset button and you
have a four digit postcode and the
reason for this is is this postcode
reads when you're when you're done with
the post process this postcode will
actually display CPU temperatures and it
reads you know it reads just fine for
positive temperatures if you go over a
over 99 degrees then it'll just go from
like 99 to a zero because that there is
a 10 so basically that's ten and a zero
and if this was a say 3 then you know
you'd have a hundred and three degrees
centigrade so it reads CPU temperatures
that way but the reason why actually has
that second part of the digits is this
actually does negative temperatures as
well and it goes accurate all the way
down to minus 64 degrees centigrade this
is extremely handy for extreme
overclockers because it allows you to
check the condition of your thermal
paste without worrying about sticky
stuffing a thermal probe behind the CPU
which the dark does support there is a
hole in the middle of the CPU socket for
putting a thermal probe through but
that's just way less convenient then you
know just using the postcode to read the
temperature directly from the die so
very very handy feature right there
under that you find a clear CMOS button
and a whole bunch of LEDs for
troubleshooting these they do things
like indicate critical CPU errors as
well as the presence of your various
voltages like 12 volts 5 volts 5 volts
standby 3.3 volts
and any other voltages that the
motherboard needs to operate that it
gets from external sources so that
simplifies the troubleshooting process
you have similar LEDs actually scattered
around the motherboard elsewhere for
example above the memory slots which you
can't see but they're there behind each
memory slot you have two LEDs there's a
white one and there's a red one and
these are actually super handy in my
opinion because basically these LEDs
indicate how many functioning memory
slots you have if they're all white you
all your memory salts are working I'm
not sure if some of these LEDs turn off
if you use a KB like xcp you like the
white LED might not light up if you're
on a KB like X CPU I do believe you'll
only have the KB like X memory slots
lighting up all the other the other two
memory slots will be blacked out but so
that's nice you you get a visual
indicator of the LEDs with like which
memory salts are working but the other
thing is when you train that red LED
indicates if your memory Channel failed
so when you go through the post process
you're gonna go through the post codes B
6 to beat while B 0 to B 7 but really on
the post code all you're really gonna
see is the b6 and b7 post code
flickering back and forth and after that
if any of your memory channels has a red
LED on it you will know that that memory
Channel failed to Train and this is
super handy because you can skip the
entire process of going to the BIOS to
fix yourself going to the BIOS or
Windows to check if your memory failed
you will know immediately after startup
if your memory is all working which for
normal users this is not really a big
deal memory training misses aren't that
common until you start pushing the
memory settings that I showed you
earlier like 39 33 or 41 20 at CL 12
we're actually getting the memory to
train properly is often a matter of
multiple reboots and like really
fine-tuning some of the settings so this
gets very very handy because it helps
you troubleshoot any kind of memory boot
issues
but before you get all the way into
Windows and check that oh yeah we're not
running quite channel or running triple
channel so that's a really really nice
feature to have right there along with
all of those LEDs now the one thing that
I think this board is missing while two
things this board is missing is there's
no safe boot button so that clear like
you're basically stuck clearing the BIOS
every time you have any like if you have
a full memory training failure where all
four of your memory slots for sky like X
turn red or both of your memory slots
for K be like X turn red you're gonna be
hitting clear CMOS because this
motherboard does not does is not
particularly good at retraining and
there isn't really a retraining button
like there's not a retry button either
for attempting multiple train attempts
quickly but in my experience it wouldn't
really help you because I've tried
retraining the board on the same
settings multiple times and it doesn't
really get anywhere once you all of your
memory channels are failed
it's basically clear CMOS as the only
way to get into the BIOS the board
compensates for the fact that you're
gonna be trashing your memory like your
bio settings often by giving you a
million profiles like it can store by
far the most profiles I've seen on any
motherboard but I'd really prefer if
there was a safe boot button which you
just press and it gets you into the BIOS
on safe settings without wiping the
entire BIOS a retry button to skip the
entire like if you want to retrain about
motherboard without a retry bus and you
need to cut PSU power to the motherboard
and then like redo the entire and then
started a them you know power it back up
and we're gonna see if it retrains so
that's again just a quality-of-life
feature that's kind of missing and then
finally the board lacks a slow mode
switch which I find very like for
liquid-nitrogen overclocking on X 299 I
find that rather concerning because even
at just 4.9 gigahertz the 14 core that I
have idles on about 10 amp on like 12
amps down the 12 volt connectors which
translates to about a hundred and forty
Watts idle if you turn off all your
power savings which you should do for
extreme overclocking which
that 140 watts Idol on liquid nitrogen
translates into a lot of wasted liquid
nitrogen just keeping the system running
at well idle so I'd really appreciate if
the board had a slow mode because slow
mode is on a lot of extreme overclocking
motherboards and the reason why it's
there is it enables you to immediately
drop the CPU from you know full speed to
the lowest possible CPU ratio so on X
299 you could go like let's say you're
doing ln2 overclocking and you're at 555
X a hundred after slow mode your 55 X
would go to 12 X and you'd be at 1.2
gigahertz and this actually
significantly reduces power consumption
because you've just got like a more than
four times decrease in core clock which
will actually cut your power consumption
very significantly so that would be
really handy for you know like the the
time like you boot up and when you're
configuring your OS and opening
benchmarks and making sure everything is
just right slow mode would be extremely
handy to have on this motherboard for
ln2 overclocking because X 299 is really
really hot and already on X 99 slow mode
was a feature I used a lot with the
motherboards that had it because it just
saves you a lot of it saving you liquid
nitrogen but yeah this board doesn't
have a slow mode which is a kind of
unfortunate it's not like a disaster
because there's a lot of boards with no
slow mode but it is a nice quality of
life feature especially for a platform
as power-hungry as X 299 now moving
along what it does give you as switch
wise is a BIOS switch its triple BIOS
which is kind of insane like I don't
know why you need triple BIOS but it
doesn't hurt that's for sure and you
know two BIOS I think is the minimum
BIOS account requirement for like a
overclocking board this has three so
nothing to complain about here under
that you actually find the socketable
BIOS chips so you can actually like if
you manage to somehow brick all three of
your biases you can actually ask for a
replacement chip from EVGA and it's not
going to be
massive pain to do the swap because a
lot of other motherboards have the BIOS
chips soldered into them and if you
break the if you break all of your BIOS
chips there's like you're either gonna
have to get an external flashing device
or you're gonna have to de solder the
the break BIOS chips and replace one of
them with a good one
to recover from so yeah the soft gated
Biol BIOS chip is is that's a nice
feature
under that you find this connector right
here which is the probit connector now
this is EVGA is implementation of
voltage read points it's uh it's a
really clean implementation it's
unfortunately not a very useful one and
the reason for this is is this doesn't
like you can monitor VCC in you can
monitor recore VM and the problem with
this is VCC PLL which is a cable like ex
exclusive voltage and VC CSA and the
problem with this is that on SE sky like
x for example you also have v mesh which
i would like to be able to monitor VCC
i/o which i would like to be able to
monitor and v dim is not a single
voltage on this motherboard because if
you look washed the vrm analysis you
would know that there is a voltage
controller and a power phase for each
set of DIMM slots specifically and that
actually allows you to do things like
having these two memory slots at 1.9 for
2 volts and this slot these two slots at
2 volts or really you could go to the
absolute extreme and set these to at one
point two and this to 2 volts like you
can set different voltages on your
memory slots depending on what memory
sticks you have in them so if you have
two memory sticks that don't really
tolerate super high voltage you can put
your two memory sticks that don't
tolerate a super high voltage into two
slots and the ones that prefer more
voltage into the other two slots and you
can run different different voltages on
your memory slots but you can't actually
check what both of your memories lot
like what your different memory slots
running out because there's only one
vedyam so read point on the probit
connector and the reason for this is is
EVGA actually went for making this thing
like super accurate so you get a proper
ground reference for every single one of
the pins but I think it would have been
just better if they grabbed a ground
reference from like right and like right
behind the CPU I just pulled a ground
line once and then just crammed more
voltage readings on to that because
currently you can't actually monitor all
the different voltages that the board
offers for you to play with which I
think well that that's kinda unfortunate
though this is definitely a better way
of doing voltage read points than what a
lot of other top-end overclocking
motherboards do which is solder bumps
basically usually in an awkward place
like if the 24 pin which this one has a
right angle 24 pin but if you have a 24
pin sticking right up the solder bumps
will be like right next to it for your
various voltages and that actually makes
measuring the voltage on those bumps
really really really hard because you
need to get under the 24 pin power cable
and it's just not convenient like if
you're in the middle of a benchmark on
liquid nitrogen the last thing you want
to be doing is trying to measure
voltages at the same time so while this
is like a very nice implementation it's
not particularly useful because the
range of what you can measure on it is
actually kind of limited so that's kind
of unfortunate next to that we find a 5
channel dip switch this is for your PCIe
slots and this board this is another
really cool feature in my opinion for
this board because I'm a big fan of big
multi-gpu setups so 3-way 4-way I love
it
and for competitive benchmarking not for
gaming like gaming games supporting the
3 Way or 4 Way anything is just
basically non-existent but benchmarks
are on three-way and four-way just fine
so there it's really really nice and
this board is obviously targeted at
extreme overclocking and competitive
overclocking so it's nice to have this
PCIe slot layout because you can run one
two three like that if you want you know
three slot spacing on your GPU
works just fine and you can also run of
course four-way you would run one two
three four and this PCIe slot is
actually like wired into the CPU it's
not off the PCH which is a nice thing
and it's a full 8x and that's why you
actually get the five channel dip switch
up here because it allows you to disable
this slot this slot this one this one
and this one and the reason why you'd
want to be able to disable your PCIe
slots
is if you're running liquid nitrogen or
say custom water cooling and all of your
motherboard like all of your bore all of
your graphics cards are water blocked
into place and actually really hard to
remove if one of the GPUs is causing the
motherboard to not start up you can just
disable the PCIe slot and you can boot
up without that GPU it'll basically act
like that GPU doesn't exist which is
really convenient for certain
troubleshooting scenarios now then to
make it all so easy for you to tell if
you're like which PCIe slots are enabled
and which aren't you get to LEDs again
so you get a white LED here and a green
LED the green LED tells you if the PCIe
slot has a working device in it the
white LED tells you if the PCIe slot is
enabled so if you switch a PCIe slot off
so let's say we push this pin like this
switch down the v switch off then the
white LED for this slot down here would
not turn on so these would just be you
know they wouldn't light up whereas all
the other enabled ones that would light
up white and if you put it as a device
in them they light up white and green
now the only unfortunate thing about
this is is that since these are right
next to the PCIe slots if you're running
a big multi-gpu setup there's a pretty
good chance that seeing these LEDs is
gonna be really hard because there's
gonna be a GPU sitting right over them
so yeah it's nice that it's there it's
just kind of hard to use and I have the
same complaint for the LEDs above the
memory slots because normally if you're
in a overclocking environment with a
test bench you're gonna be somewhere to
the you know to the right of the
motherboard
so that you can access this corner and
this area of the board and have good
access to all of your ln2 pots which
would be located right around here and
well if you're located you know if
you're to the right of this board seeing
these LEDs tends to be kind of hard
especially because the vrm heatsink has
like he heat pipe that goes right over
them though you can generally like get
an idea if this area is glowing red or
white so that's not too bad but when
you're running a three-way or a four-way
setup seeing these LEDs is very very
difficult like they're basically they're
buried under GPUs so you know it's nice
that those indicators are there they're
just not superb like they're not most
effectively positioned but you know nice
that it's there and you actually get
LEDs for also your MDOT two slots you
get LEDs for your these these are the
youtubes yeah so the U dot two
connectors get LEDs these flash on power
on like this this board is loaded out
with like troubleshooting LEDs
everywhere so that's actually really
nice some of them are kind of in
conveniently positioned but they're they
are definitely useful the board also has
a speaker which is a I find it actually
kind of handy when I'm benchmarking on
like air cooling or water cooling where
I'm not paying a ton of attention to the
system this is really handy to know when
you have to start mashing the delete
button because it'll be back you you can
disable the beeper in the BIOS obviously
so it's not like it's just you know it's
not gonna go drive you insane but when
you clear the BIOS the first startup
will always beep so yeah but you know
nice and a feature to have in my opinion
there's a lot of motherboards that to
have this and just have it removable so
I don't really like it's not a huge
benefit but it is there and next to that
you find the this six pin power
connector this is here basically for
running big multi-gpu setups because
your 24-pin has exactly two 12-volt pins
in it and those two 12-volt pins are
good for about 10 amps
which means if you have which basically
means you can push about 240 watts into
your PCIe slots without burning all of
your you know without burning down your
24-pin which if you think about this
right each of these PCIe slots aspect at
75 watts output and we go times 4 that's
300 watts you can't technique like you
can't run a high power consumption
four-way GPU or even a 3-way GPU setup
because a 3-way setups gonna get you to
225 before you do overclocking on some
cards like a R X 480 you're gonna be
pushing 225 before you do any
overclocking after overclocking this
you're gonna go over that very very
easily and if you're on a 4 Way R X 480
setup then god hell god help the 24-pin
because it's gonna need it except not on
this motherboard because you have the 6
pin down here you plug that in and your
PCIe slots are gonna be pulling a good
chunk of their power from the 6 pin and
the 6 pin is a 3 x 12 so that is capable
of delivering an extra three hundred and
sixty watts to the PCIe slots so that's
a handy feature again for competitive
overclockers for basically everybody
else this is kind of irrelevant because
most people won't be running a huge
multi-gpu setup though maybe if you're
running some kind of like high power
consumption raid cards or sound cards or
capture cards this might come in handy
but most most PCIe
devices don't tend to go like GPUs are
generally the biggest power hogs so this
is mostly for large multi GPU setups
it's not really meant for anything else
but you could use it for sound cards and
that kind of thing as well if you have
some exceptionally power-hungry
non GPU devices now moving back up the
board in the i/o area you get a clear
CMOS switch so for those of you using
this motherboard incorrectly and inside
a case because really this is meant for
this is really a motherboard meant for a
test bench but if you are using this
motherboard in in case because you're a
filthy casual you
you get a clear submit with CMOS switch
right there because again if you screw
up your settings the motherboard will
not recover so you can just wipe the
BIOS from there and that pretty much
covers it in terms of the physical
features that this motherboard comes
with for extreme overclocking and it's
is well equipped I really do think I
actually love all the different
troubleshooting LEDs around the board
they are like that's a really cool
feature I really like that and I'm a fan
of the post code like the the minus 64
degrees readings on the post code and
the temperature monitoring on the post
code that's really really cool I've had
other motherboards that kind of did that
they didn't go into the negative
temperature range so this is just like a
straight upgrade over that and I do
think that's a really cool feature but
the lack of the slow mode switch and
safe boot as well as retry buttons is
like as a that's uh that's something I
would really like to see from this
motherboard because it's so close to
perfect and the other like the other
complaint I have is this right the the
probit connector it's too limited it's
just like you can't measure there's far
too far more voltages on this
motherboard I would like to be able to
measure then what this connector allows
you to measure and yeah that's really my
only complaints other than that this is
very close to perfect as far as an
overclocking motherboards feature setup
goes but safe boot retry slow mode and
more voltage read options would be
really really welcome in future
motherboards from EVGA but for now the
this thing is like probably like the is
really well featured so yeah that's it
for the video thank you for watching

down below if you would like to support
what we do here at gamers Nexus there is
a patreon link you can find that in the
description and probably in the comments
I have a channel called actually
hardcore overclocking which is even more
extreme overclocking focused in this
video so if you'd like to check that out
that would be cool and see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
