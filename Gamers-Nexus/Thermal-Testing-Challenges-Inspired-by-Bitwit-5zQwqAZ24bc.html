other content creators with their
thermal testing and also explain to
viewers why temperature testing with
cases coolers GPUs is a lot more
difficult than it seems on paper this
idea came about when I was watching one
of fit wits videos Kyle about CPU cooler
orientation and it was a great idea
we've tested in the past quite a long
time ago at this point and Kyle had some
interesting findings where he basically
said that look here's the data I found
but I don't necessarily understand why
the numbers are the way they are because
I didn't expect it to be that way and
that approach just a briefly state here
is perfect you can't get a better
approach than that to science when
you're saying look I've done the testing
I've done due diligence to make sure it
wasn't something weird as far as I know
but I don't fully understand the results
here's the data what do you think that's
a great way to approach it because the
other options are throughout the data
what you don't want to do because there
might be some really valid thing there
that he's discovered that's not being
discussed or of course presents it as
hard fact which also you don't want to
do is you don't naturally understand the
data so the reason I bring this up is
because I have gone through that so many
times the last few years thermal testing
up until maybe the last year and a half
for us has been a major headache
there was a full year where we stopped
doing case reviews at all with thermals
in them because we were having issues
and then brought it all back after I was
able to validate our new testing
methodology in thermal chambers and
really create some numbers that I
finally trusted and that was a hard
process to go through we've got videos
detailing with thermal chambers we've
got videos detailing our temperature
measurements all that stuff but I want
to go through some of the more gritty
details today just as briefly as I can
because this is a Sunday video for us
which means I'm producing it myself the
other two guys are off today before
getting to that this is brought to you
by our patreon backers thank you so
those of you who support us you can go
to patreon.com/crashcourse maxis to help
out we've got a couple goals there we've
reached one of the most immediate ones
but we're pretty close to the next one
so do check out the site if you want to
help out Karen's Nexus net or
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus and you
can support us directly so before
getting into the details here any
content creators or anyone up-and-coming
or established or whatever if you're
using any of them at
is that we talk about in this video you
know give me a shout because this stop
has been a long time in the making years
and years of work to kind of slowly
figure it out and it's expensive to do
and sharing with competition obviously
we keep some sub secret but I'll put a
lot of it out there in this content just
you know point folks are ways I would
greatly appreciate that let's go over
some of the stuff on a table we've got
coolers that I've tested we have tools
we have thermal paste and we have notes
of huge issues I've run into the in the
past that have invalidated data or
caused major headaches that put us back
weeks in production and it's all mostly
figured out I won't put everything we do
in this video because one obviously
competitive reasons but two there's a
lot to do so our tests are fully
automated which helps the script is
internal only but you could write your
own script if you wanted to the test
environment there's a few things that
really matter here one is ambient
temperature and we've talked about that
in the past another one is the bios
settings those are really critical
probably more than any other single
aspect of thermal testing so let's let's
go with ambient temperature first room
ambient you want to control the
temperature in the room as much as
possible if the thermal chamber is not
available we don't have some a thermal
chamber but we've validated in one so
the methodology is known good and that's
really all we needed for for this type
of testing for room ambient just setting
the thermostat is not good enough so if
you set your thermostat to say 20
Celsius which is about what ours is
they're still going to be fluctuations
and some of it could be from vents in
the ceiling if a vent is directly over a
test bench one day and you move it and
it's not the next day that actually does
have a big impact and too is ambient
fluctuates of course because the things
going to toggle on and off throughout
the day whether it's heat or forced air
or AC or whatever that impact seen and
there's really only one good way to
control for that which is going to be
active logging of the ambient
temperature so as we discussed before we
use thermocouple readers there's a whole
list of caveats with these as well I'm
not going to go into these details from
training but you use a thermocouple
reader you log the ambient temperature
ideally you also if do an internal
testing like Kyle did with
the internal case temperature as well
and you do that on a second a second
basis so the idea is to create a giant
excel file and it's work but it's really
accurate you create a big excel file one
column is the ambient temperature you've
logged other ambient temperatures or
probes you blog go somewhere else and
then you have your CPU column for either
package Recor whatever metric that you
trust from the software that's a whole
different n2 so once you've created that
you can create a delta value and this
helps control for the fluctuation and
ambience whatever is happening up there
from the ceiling vents or floor vents or
whatever you can control for that that
helps but it doesn't fix all problems
and there are plenty of things there
that are not quite so straight board
either but we did discuss that in one of
our previous videos I'll put it in the
description or something so a
thermocouple readers help we use K types
they have about a two point two degrees
Celsius range if you're using multiples
you will want to calibrate them put a
nice water put it in boiling water see
what the temperature difference is and
then you create an offset in the
spreadsheet and just make it build a
template around that the next thing is
really just bio so CPU the things that
matter here when using an Intel CPU
especially it's important to disable
basically everything you disable see
state store power saving states to see
table a is T speed step speed shift
anything like that disable turbo boost
then lock the frequency to a fixed
frequency for all cores and then lock
the vcore as much as you can and
motherboards do have variants here so
the motherboard really matters a lot and
we showed in our 7700 K review you can
have a perks of 20 to 30 degrees Celsius
swings
if using Auto V core with different
motherboards and even fixed v cores that
you've configured so fix all the voltage
settings you can for the CPU we do one
point two eights or one point two seven
five depending on what particular cooler
and CPU and bench we're working with and
that will fix almost all the problems
immediately so the reason that is is
because when you have a CPU an Intel CPU
says I am going to boost as much as
possible when the thermals allow and
when voltage and power supplies allow so
let's say the CP is boosting
occasionally it will either have you
might have the droop whether that's from
your voltage and power supply chain or
you could have just a frequency drop and
voltage change up or down based on
whatever's going on with the test
process and of course AVX instructions
also can really change things so make
sure you understand what those are -
that's using prime95 or something like
that but with the voltage supply
basically with the like with a gigabyte
board we tested you can see the voltage
go up to 1.4 and then fall to 1.28 and
if it's doing that throughout a test
process the temperature's going to be
all over the place and if you're
averaging over say a thousands of cells
of data it's not it's just not going to
be reliable and I can say that
confidently because I've gone through
that I know how difficult it is you're
sitting there pulling you're in my case
many hairs have wondering what the hell
is going on why is this configuration
that's clearly superior by all measures
doing worse than this other one so like
an example would be if you tested two
same company products maybe a two eighty
versus a you know 120 even or something
like that if you see temperatures that
are really closed or unreliable it's
probably because of the accordant cpu
setting so all that needs to be fixed or
turned off and for anyone who says well
as endless cpu is not a real-world
scenario anywhere because now it's not
out of box why would you test that way
well the reason is with thermal testing
we're not doing a CPU review so you
don't care about how does the CPU do
these functions all you care about is
how do I make the CPU a steady-state how
does it do one thing generate heat and
do that one thing with exceptional
accuracy and make it reproducible every
single test the answer is turn all of
that power saving off of the turbo
boost and all that stuff off and fix
vcore that fixes most problems next
thing then so the fans of the bench
whether it's open air or in a system
they should be connected to power supply
and it should be power sight with a
voltage that you really trust because if
there's fluctuations again if it's a
cheapo power supply it might swing from
something like 11 to 12 volts and that
does
the fan speed so that's important to
know I don't trust the motherboards
generally to control my fans for me some
of them do it just fine but we've had
too many issues in the past so I go
straight to the power supply and what
else can we do here
software I buy I both note on the sheet
software can't be trusted and it's true
for a lot of things Andy for example if
you're running AMD CPUs for your thermal
benchmarks good luck because they use a
different temperature scale t TTL and
your temperature is with AMD for FX and
FM CPUs it will look like it can idle
below ambient that is impossible it is
not physically possible to have a lower
temperature than ambient with any of
these coolers on the table weather well
yeah any of these click on a table
whether it's air or liquid and that's
because the the temperature that is
ultimately being pulled through the
radiator is going to be the ambient
temperature so it's impossible so if you
see temperatures that when you produce a
delta value are negative that means
something went horribly wrong it could
be a negative 0.5 and that might be a
calibration thing with one of these or
it could be negative 5 or negative 10
and that's wrong it's not possible so
that's that's an AMD thing and that's
not just an abuse of software was then
this might change but softer pulls data
from sensors in the chip and you need to
understand what values can you trust for
example if kb lake it was it was kind of
difficult with all the core temperatures
and things the software didn't work
quite the way it has in the past for the
immediate versions anyway as they
updated my change but for kb lake you
want to use cpu package through hardware
monitor because that's the same as x to
you which is obviously trustworthy
because in the intel utility so that
matters make sure you understand which
metric you're using and stick with it
whether you're taking all four cores or
whatever and averaging them or whether
you're taking cpu package I don't use
cores with KB Lake I you CP package from
hardware monitor or from Ada and then
just check it with XT you and make sure
your state
so that mostly covers software can't be
trusted as my bullet points software is
also really important though once you've
got a base understanding of
turn on logging run it for the entire
task and generate logs for everything
because it doesn't hurt to have more
data so we generate logs for CPU
frequency at CPU utilization I'm talking
about this cooling testing obviously the
core all the voltages all the power draw
measurements sometimes it's accurate
sometimes not depending on the software
and the CPU and temperatures and then
dump everything into a spreadsheet and
the idea is when you do have one of
those scenarios really like what the
hell is going on here I don't get it you
look through the vlogs and you can say
oh what's why does the frequency just
drop from 4.4 to 4.3 up cause so log
files are critically important for that
and there's a lot of other stuff I to
kind of quickly go through the rest
multiple tests in the same location with
the same configuration are important so
before embarking on any kind of cooler
or thermal passing build the test
platform change nothing after obviously
finally setting changes nothing and run
the same thermal benchmark whether using
prime95 or whatever else you want to use
ADA or any of those tools make sure the
test runs are sufficient length to warm
up and saturate the cooler and figure
out where you're going to start
averaging for the load and the idle
temperatures and things like that and
once you've run that test enough times
look at the data and try and understand
is it the same what is my variance and
if you've got a variance of about a
degree and you can't get any more
accurate than that which is possible
then it's time to add a little note to
the charts and say my temperatures I
have a variance of plus or minus 1
degrees Celsius and so then you can say
if we've got a cooler that's measuring
at 51 versus another one at 52 they are
effectively identical you cannot do any
further validation to prove that one is
better than the other and of course
functionally the basically the same
anyway even if those hard numbers are
accurate but if you've got a 1 or - what
plus 1 minus 1 degrees Celsius change
then just I make a note of that of
course hours of 0.5 or so after
calibrating for the thermo
and all of that stuff a test environment
matters too so that would include things
like thermal paste open versus closed
there I'm not going to go into that
today or the there's a couple other
themes GPU load things like that so
let's let's do kind of talk about go
back to Kyle situation Kyle was testing
in a system and he is using a utility
that loads both the CPU the GPU and some
of the memory as unit in heaven and so
when you're doing that the the potential
thing to look out for is GPU workload
because now we could do all these
controls I've already listed for the CPU
but now if you're involving the GPU it
gets a whole lot more complicated we
don't involve GPUs for for cooler tests
for his Testament but you have to
control for one it's got to be the same
video card so if you're changing coolers
pick a reference board pull the
reference cooler off put it on whatever
you're testing use the same card and
then you've also got to control for of
course clock freak like the frequency
you have to control for boosting if it's
a Pascal cards the whole good luck
that's a lot more difficult control for
a voltage fan speed power draw and
temperature thresholds and things like
that I could impact performance ideally
you fix the fan speed on the GPU ideally
you fix all fan speeds which if I
haven't mentioned it yet that's the next
most important thing I have to CP
voltages every fan you must have a fixed
speed for no variants no smart CPU fan
header no letting Windows or BIOS or the
motherboard or a fan controller or the
built-in software for the cooler try and
control the fan speed that ruins
everything you can do those tests
separately but not for the main
benchmark but back to Kyle stuff so GPU
the back the GPU can radiate heat when
we tested the EVGA cards for vrm
temperatures we saw that we were able to
get the backplate one card up to
something like 130 Celsius when we
really really really tortured it beyond
any reasonable measure by dumping 40 or
50 degrees Celsius air straight into the
VRM fan from a liquid cooler so the
point is the back of the GPU can radiate
a lot of heat in the penny
how're your coolers oriented that can
impact the CP temperature now that's a
valid test environment that's a valid
thing to look for but you know it's got
to be controlled and understood so the
example would be if you are radiating
Heat off the back the card and you flip
the cooler so that it is now oriented
this way it could be sucking hot air in
through here and and that would actually
increase your CPU temperatures because
you're now just yeah I mean you're
pushing more heat through the cooler and
it's only got so much you can handle
before it's kind of saturated so that's
something to look out for basically
control GPU and everything else with the
system everything it's it's really
annoying every single thing has to be
fixed and you've gotta log it around the
test a million times and make sure you
understand the the variance for each
particular component pretty annoying but
great once it works thermal paste so we
have their own pace from the same batch
that we know same conductivity oh this
is getting really really gritty not
necessarily that important compared to
all the rest because the variance is
going to be small here but you know once
you've already done all the other work
for all this other stuff you might as
well so we used with liquid coolers
they're all paste applicators this makes
sure that we've got a video on it when
we apply the thermal compound to any
liquid cooler it's exactly the same it's
equivalent to coming straight out of a
factory and then fixed application
method for your air coolers is important
as well and of course there's all kinds
of oxide variables curing time
technically pays can cure we don't
really account for that that is one
variable I don't care about right now
because they're tested and it's not
important versus all the other stuff to
worry about I think about covers the
basics anyone thinking about thermal
cameras we've got a whole video on all
the problems with using one of these
they're great tools but they it's
another thing that you got to understand
what it's doing so I think that I think
that goes through most of it I will add
as many images and things as I can to
this video as I said it's a Sunday video
which means I'm producing it myself so
hopefully just the knowledge will help
if anyone out there finds this useful
please
if your content creator just you know
let folks know that we we helped out
because this has been many years in the
making it's been very expensive to
develop the methodology and sharing it
is a you keep something secret but
sharing this much if it's helped you
please just let folks know and point
them our way so thanks for watching if
you have any questions
