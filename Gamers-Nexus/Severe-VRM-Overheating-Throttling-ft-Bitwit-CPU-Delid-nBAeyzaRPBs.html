looks like to trip over temperature
protection on a vrm it's a total
offshoot unplanned video we were working
on deleting bit wit Kyle's 79 80 XE for
his new PC build and while testing a
heavy overclock and over voltage we
encountered spy keep our behavior and
clock throttling when we weren't even
hitting t.j.maxx
this is a matter of inadequate cooling
on the BRM even with the half-hearted
attempt of adding fins that some of
these manufacturers have reacts to 99
you still need airflow or a huge amount
of surface area and it's not enough to
come part way we'll be looking at that
and some delayed benchmarks in this one
before getting to that this coverage is
brought to you by EVGA and Nvidia with
the destiny to 1080 TI bundle a 1080i SC
to comes with a synchronous fan control
for its dual fans and nine thermal
sensors and again includes destiny to
learn more at the link in the
description below let's start with the
vrm stuff first this is a complete side
shoot discussion but one that's worth
exploring we were doing some thermal
paste versus liquid metal and sealant
versus no sealant testing with IHS and
the substrate using Kyle's CPU and ended
up running into issues where the
multiplier was bouncing between 12 X and
our set 45 X and that was with the
actually with liquid metal and with
thermal paste with the thermal paste
testing we were hitting t.j.maxx so it
looks like clock throttling because of
t.j.maxx so you write it off as that
with the liquid metal version we weren't
really getting that close to t.j.maxx
which is 104 C we were below 90 so the
fact that we're dropping clocks from 45
acts to 12 says something's very wrong
and looking into it further in the first
test that I do in that situation is
touch the heatsink of the vrm and if it
feels like it's going to burn your
finger within three seconds it's
probably too hot it's not the most
accurate test but it's one that's right
nine times out of ten so doing that
simple test put a fan on it blasted the
vrm with air and therefore dissipated
all of that heat and lo and behold the
clock stopped the throttling it was now
old in 45 acts stable and that is
people of what Deborah was talking about
earlier this year when he was doing his
ex 299 vrm disaster video so basically
this was on the X 299 ROG extreme
whatever motherboard I don't the
high-end board and it's really not got
the best heatsink on there the problem
is it's jammed in between memory a high
TDP CPU a GPU back plate that has
radiative heat coming off of it and it's
got no direct airflow because it's got
these big towers of RAM and whatever
coolers on the CPU surrounding it and no
using an air cooler on the CPU is not
gonna fix it either because all that air
goes over the top of the vrm heatsink
not through it so it's a challenge and
to fix it you basically put a fan above
it and blast it with air and that solved
the clock throttling this chart of the
average multipliers tells the story
pretty well it was all over the place
but we weren't actually tripping
t.j.maxx went under liquid metal we were
about 83 to 89 Celsius intermittently
across all cores averaging ultimately
283 point four degrees Celsius this
isn't anywhere remotely close to the 104
C throttle threshold for skylake X so
obviously again something's wrong and it
wasn't the current limit either but in
this chart you can see that the current
fluctuation also reflected the frequency
modulation so it would be easy to think
that it might be a current limit of some
kind on the board this line is ideally
fairly steady and straight in a blender
type workload as each thread renders a
one tile at infinitum until render
completion the orange and red lines are
crashing against an unknown wall at this
time and it's not current that's not
t.j.maxx but the blue line remains
steady the question of course remains
for what we changed with the blue line
and that change was adding the fan so
that fixed the problem basically the vrm
one went back and tested it later was
running about 120 degrees Celsius
because it's sitting there with a part
that can pull 500 Watts
easy and it's got 60 degrees Celsius
sticks of memory on all sides of the vrm
there's rear i/o next to the the left
part of the vrm on the l-shape and
on the top side you have the part of the
CLC or the air cooler or whatever it is
that's really not going to be pushing
any air on to that the only way to cool
that thing the top part of it is a
downdraft cooler and those aren't going
to be any good for this type of
processor so that's the problem and we
fixed it with a direct fan now something
for Kyle to maybe consider with his ten
thousand dollar PC build he's he's
taking the CPU for would be to look into
the option of a full coverage block that
would cover the V RMS as well depending
on which board it is I don't remember
which one of these using that may or may
not be possible but that's something to
look into
otherwise just I would say Kyle try and
get some kind of fan on the top or in
the side or somewhere to push air onto
that thing if you're running it
overclocked now you're just gonna film
it for pretty b-roll run some quick
tests I'd say throw the fan in there for
your test take it out for your b-roll
call it a day
but the BRM that we have on our ACS
board was not happy
it was very not happy so yeah that
pretty much shows you what Deborah was
talking about earlier we might look into
it more stick a lot of thermocouples
onto things didn't do it for this just
yet but it's an option for the future so
for the next part of this we've got the
benchmarks with Kyle's CPU doing D lid
versus lidded and shields vs. no sealant
this was just a quick round of test so
we do fixed frequency and voltage to
make sure there's no fluctuation I have
some auto charts in here at the end to
restore perspective as to what the CPU
does without any influence from all this
stuff and for the overclock applied a
simple 4.5 gigahertz 1.2 4v ID which is
what we found to be stable on our CPU
now 1.2 4v ID is pretty much pushing the
limit of what I'm comfortable with with
a 79 80 XE I'd rather be in the 1.15
21.2 range but we thought what we needed
for our CPU I have not tested what
Kyle's max frequency and voltages I just
applied what I knew would work keep that
in mind but all that matters is that
they're fixed so we can determine a
delta between the lidded and deleted
with delayed results from our 4.5
gigahertz overclock and 1.2 4v ID tiles
79 ATX e with Tim and blender had
several cores bumping into t.j.maxx at
104 Celsius causing clocks to drop
multiplier to 12x this isn't just the
vrm thing here this is actually just
overheating on the CPU itself we were
not able to sustain the overclock during
this test with our X 62 at max speeds
we'd either need a better cooler or
lower clocks and voltage after a D lid
and some liquid metal our heavy silicon
adhesive attempt where and we used the
adhesive on both layers and on all sides
of the substrate and the IHS that had us
at t.j.maxx once again so even with
liquid metal it wasn't any better which
tells you that the adhesive was too
thick because the liquid metal either
wasn't doing its job or there were air
pockets manually spreading the adhesive
into a thin film on just the top layer
of the substrate and only in the
pertinent corners resulted in an 83
degrees Celsius average core temperature
resolving our clock throttling issue
completely at least once we had the fans
going the overclock is now stable and
operates at 45 X constantly as for the
GM parts we were at 75 degrees Celsius
with our unsealed IHS previously and
this was with a different chip different
liquid metal application and without any
sealant so a couple of factors there to
consider but either way it was running a
bit cooler part of that is because of
the lack of sealant and part of it is
just a different CPU with prime95 fixed
at 3.6 gigahertz and 1.15 V ID which by
the way is aggressive but that's because
we want it to be fixed the GN Tim unit
operated an all core average of 89 point
five degrees Celsius peaking at nine DC
with the unsealed liquid metal variant
at 72 point four degrees Celsius that's
a 17 degree improvement
Kyle's Tim unit ran out of box thermals
of 86 point six degrees Celsius peaking
at 89 degrees more or less what we saw
for the most part with a light sealant
again and only the most important areas
we managed the 76 degrees Celsius
average and 77 C peak for peak to peak
drops we saw a 12 degree dip in
terms of degrees Celsius for Kyle CPU
with the light sealant version keep in
mind that these are two separate CPUs
once again so we can't definitively
state that the sealing caused the 5c
difference in entirety but what we can
state is that the combination of these
factors resulted in a 5 C Delta and
Kyle's CPU still benefits from a 12
degree improvement from comparison
against itself with liquid metal and a
light reseal versus Intel's Tim out of
curiosity we also tested a medium seal
on Kyle CPU finding that the output
temperature was 78 to 80 degrees Celsius
up from 76 to 77 this basically had a
line of silicone adhesive on both the
top and bottom substrates but it was
thinned out from the original heavier
attempt we can definitively state in
this case that the sealant caused the 2
to 3 degrees Celsius leap and thermals
just because the rhetoric often gets out
of control with d-lighting tests let's
keep in mind that these chips are 100%
operable with the stock Tim it's just a
matter of how far you can push them with
Auto settings which introduce variants
and voltage and power consumptions so we
can't do an a/b comparison the CPU is
run at around 50 degrees with blender or
50 to 60 to with prime95 we don't use
auto for comparisons between Tim and
liquid metal because it's unpredictable
and not really repeatable for testing
however we're showing this here to again
give perspective that yes these CPUs
cannot operate without a deal it'd it
just helps to do it so then while on
that point to recap why and when you
would deal it'd deal it in Al's
primarily into things helping with
thermals
it's not just because the temperature is
lower that you do it it's because by
lowering the temperature you give
yourself Headroom to lower the fan RPMs
or buy a cheaper cooler for example in
the blender test we could throw a 360
cooler on there and fix the problem of
running out of thermal Headroom on
Kyle's CPU with the original Tim but
it'd be a 360 cooler it'd be bigger it'd
be more expensive if you delete it like
we did you can run a 280 on there and
get away with it just fine so that's
something to consider another factor of
course is noise because the lower the
fan speed to lower your noise problems
and also
power leakage reduction so for every 10
ish degrees Celsius reduction in CPU
thermals you get roughly 4% of your
power back it'll consume 4 percent less
power for that tendency drop and that
comes down to power leakage and we've
demonstrated that in our past content
with the 7900 XD LED video and the 79
ATX a review and so d 960 x review where
we showed again power leakage reduction
from deleting so those are the two
primary factors the main one is noise
which is a byproduct of lowering your
cost to entry by giving you Headroom
thermally to buy cheaper cooler as well
those are the main reasons 2d lid not
necessary
it gets necessary though as you start
overclocking towards the max potential
of the silicon because the silicon can
do in our testing an extra 100 to 300
megahertz depending on the chip with a d
lid because you've reduced the thermal
Headroom issues so that's all for this

for more of course as always and kyle
will be uploading his own video of his
$10,000 PC with the CP that we deleted I
have to ship it back to them so
hopefully the liquid metal doesn't move
around and cause problems for him when
it gets back but I talked to dare bear
about how to ship it so we'll do heart
best check that out when it's live
