YouTube to say the events started it has
started so we should be live like always
let me know in the chat if the audio in
the video seems good and then we'll
start going we're gonna be overclocking
the kingpin 20 atti today 10 from EVGA
is already in chat talking trash saying
Andy is easy to overclock our txt I
equals not so easy why did did he
actually or did Vince yeah 10 did you
actually tenzin chat like I know what
this car can do on Ellen 2 because
someone else told him hey so we're back
this is Joseph on Z from bearded
hardware once again let me tweet out the
ladies yeah
so the tweet out the link and all this
talking about Tim here are just allergic
to his balls just allergic we are alive
with bones alarm king pen 20 atti
alright so its tweeted so today we are
overclocking the KP 28 e TI it's
supposed to be among the best 28 ET eyes
it's definitely the sexiest one and it's
also no power limit
so we have the X OC BIOS on there so we
go full power that's so for once there's
an Nvidia card with no power limitation
finally that was our biggest problem
with all of them ever okay so he looks
like a giant old baby
someone says about you I'm assuming am I
wearing a diaper you know hey sure no
coming will you sign that mouse pads
again if we buy during the stream wasn't
planning to you for this one if there's
like insane demands then we might do it
but Jo's got to get on a plane at the
end of the stream so we got to be
careful on time but anyway so as
previously this one will go for a couple
hours using liquid nitrogen to overclock
so we've got to 180 liter tank so we're
kinda
chat fill in for a little bit before we
really get going and the best way to
support this type of stream because it
does cost money to get these to get that
guy out here on a plane I'm never a
cheap date and spend a couple days doing
this stuff you want to support the
streams you can either do super chat
during the stream and we'll read it we
run about a thirty minutes to one hour
delay I'm reading them we will read all
of them up to a point pretty late I'll
cut it off so super chats are great way
to support or if you go to store that
gamers Nexus dotnet you can pick up a
shirt like this one which is the blue
print shirt and then we also have the
large and the medium mod mats back in
stock
so these consistently sell out they are
finally fully back in stock and we I
think we have enough large for this
stream but we are running low and large
but I did order a lot of the mediums in
the large this time so those aren't
stored on camera taxes dotnet if you
want to support and then we got two
super chats Tod bands $2.00 thank you
very much for the first super chat of
the stream said hey guys good luck with
the overclock and justin clifton $2
good morning GM good morning justin is a
fun afternoon now oh that's my morning
don't feels like morning to be honest
yeah someone in chat says teaching my
ferret to liquid nitrogen cool my GPU at
the stream Wow I'm doing the same thing
with deep just fame nice so Ellen teapot
this is the icon got to be careful with
it because it's like a perfect mount now
yeah we think yeah so it was better than
the other one that's for sure yeah so
this is the icon pot that Vince that
kingpin gave me when we visited Taiwan
about a month and a half ago and we've
got the kingpin card on there we have
the VRM is still on there
and so the heatsink both of you are and
of course we cut the VR I walk actually
we're just it's it's just a GPU I didn't
have a viewer room yeah so we have the
via i'm heatsink on both sides three
power connectors and then i've installed
the xoc BIOS from tins website tin has
been in chat a little bit he's ex devs
if you see
and chat he was I don't know what the
exact accurate title is for him but I
think we call him mad scientist behind
the kingpin part yeah I think he has a
website called ex Davis calm yes just go
and check it out that's where all the
goodies for a bunch of overclocking
kingpin stuff yeah there's a summer
really good oversea guides there too we
had a lot of other nerdy stuff yeah so
if you're interested in that he's he's
in check feel free to bother him so that
he stops bothering us yeah please bother
him as much as possible where the CPU
will walk through this just while chat
continues to fill in so CP you've got a
three sixty millimeter radiator this is
just a thermal take flow radiator is
just easy to install and then uh ninety
nine eight exe I think we're at four
point eight gigahertz yeah so it's it's
not push super hard but it's pushed
pretty far for liquid and memory is at a
4000 mega Hertz and timings we just did
like fifteen or something yeah because
on the Trident II Royals go home uh try
NZ royal silver and gold and I've linked
all those parts in the description Eva
GX to night night in dark for the
motherboards and there's two power
supplies to this one I'm sure there is
it on the bottom here so this is the
corsair ii x 1600 i this one is powering
only the GPU and it sounded different
it's on a standalone circuit and then
that one is the EVGA 1600 watt t2 and
that's powering only the rest of the
system the motherboard cpu and that's on
its own circuit so they are isolated
that way we don't trip a breaker or
something Tim said they have a fan in
the front of the garden tin said what
have a fan in the front of the card no
it's a put one in front of it yeah it's
not not down this one's fine well deal
with it 10
didn't have any issues we don't know I'm
assuming he means like during the during
the overclocking or something I need the
setup for star citizen sources and he
says kingpin is asleep all right so he's
slacking that's why chat starting to
fill in we've got Co more super chats
and will support some Allen to after
this
Kyle Glasgow five dollars no message
thank you very much Kyle for the five
bucks
Johnny nimble five dollars Canadian you
got to show off the international
audience now yeh cooking with Ellen to
round three
looking cooking is a great date idea
even if the date isn't cheap
well Jarrell I thought oh my gosh scream
next time yeah that we should actually
do that yeah that's good
you could do it period of two dollars
break it break what the card the card I
gas sure need more than two dollars for
that yeah for real Timothy McDonald I
don't what does it cost
eighteen hundred is out of that card
costs big Phil I think that was at
sixteen that I ten can practice and chat
or someone who ain't gonna use the
Internet I think it's sixteen to
eighteen hundred somewhere there
Timothy McDonald two dollars can't wait
to see what you get out of the K P
twenty atti yes us two three more to
read for now Kyle's glands get a $5
question I have an older king pain pain
PE 18 K in pain 780ti with a messed up
power connector what is the best way to
unbend the pins sorry for the puns bend
the pins on the power connector I'm not
even sure what that means
I thought that I've ever bent pins on
like a 6-pin connector oh you probably
maybe pulled it out like maybe you can
yeah if you like you can on sock it on
by accident they pull it out by the
cable I have to see it to be honest
unbend the pins
I mean bend it back yeah maybe just like
literally see a picture yeah tweet a
picture at us at gamers Nexus chor
darkest George $10 thank you have you
considered disabled inspector b2 and
related mitigations it makes quite a big
difference performance yeah so we've run
I usually do it but I'm not sure on this
one if we did it I don't know I think
that updated windows last night so oh
yeah when we played on the Internet to
grab all the utilities MZ utter and $5
off topic but do either of you play a
musical instrument nope but I can sing
you wanna stay in silver and gold for us
try and see frightened deer oil
I do not presently in any good capacity
I kind of scare you it's a shame for you
static albatross $10 so how about them
Lakers I'll take the 10 bucks thank you
I'm assuming that's the supports
reference okay so chat is starting to
feel right 1800 now that's picking up a
vent 800 is that way but the odds are
top it's at 99 I was looking at right
here and then build Zoids join chat as
well I guess actually hardcore overclock
in tier 10 is here cool well let's let's
get started I guess so today our
benchmark of choice is primarily going
to be x by extreme I don't know if we
even have portroyal
on here but we'll run TSE and then like
I said CPUs just at 4.8 all core we have
memory at 4000 mega Hertz and we didn't
try very hard for the memory or the CPU
the focus is entirely GPU today what we
were in am like plus 1600 yeah well I
mean I mean the system memory no system
memory yeah but we will be focusing on
the kingpin memory because that's
actually someone significant so Joe
you've got the RT x classified tool here
that the classified software precision
software you're gonna walk through the
software solutions is it easy to see on
the screen it will be in a second oh I
need to mention the I'll get it after
this so yeah let's
Andrew zoomed in on it you're good you
good this is on a delay yeah yeah so you
have a couple different things in the RT
x classified controller you can download
this from if you go to X steps calm and
you search for the kingpin 20 ATT I like
he has a full guide on basically I how
to do they
on the kingpin card so you download it
basically install it you'll see that you
have to uncheck it you have basically
all the book pretty much everything you
need you don't need an Eevee bar
everything you need you can just
basically control through software so
it's nice not have needing to have the
UV buff so the N VDD this is a basically
GPU voltage so for now well we're doing
what's do a full stock run to what's
just cold go back to default in yeah so
we're gonna run to end up running stock
but which is basically like a problem
the voltage voltage today just at the
auto for now but it should end up in the
ten eighty millivolt now if we want to
change it all we have to do is just
uncheck auto hit nvd to where we want to
go I'm just gonna reset it to the fall
and then FB VDD is actually mint voltage
so you can change that and then PEX
voltage it was kind of like a almost
like a peal of PLL on the old one it's
kind of like an IMC voltage and then you
have frequency and then the 1.8 via volt
rail and then you also can control the
load line and then the big one is the
OCP I was I was running to that issue
when I was pre testing it just on air
just with the stock liquid cooler so
just overclock in it eventually as you
increase the voltage you'll hit yeah OCP
and so you do have to disable that yeah
so that's the big one I mean you can't
really do anything without that so yeah
so that's over current protection yep
and that's what protects the GPU and it
thinks there's too much current but that
is not a concern of ours day because
that's intentional I do have to quickly
mention the advertisement for the stream
so we've got gigabytes actually decided
to run their monitor for this one
because people kept asking about what it
was three in the stream yesterday so
it's the ARS ad 27 QD monitor it's a
27-inch 1440p 144 Hertz freesync gaming
monitor one millisecond response time
and I've got a link to that in the
description below if you are interested
in it and it has everyone's favorite RGB
LEDs
so pretty so clearly if you have a setup
like this one and you want to show off
to the camera then this is what you buy
so that is the adverse situation show up
Billy gray and chat so does anyone from
EVGA and chat and the answer is yes 10 X
tabs is from EVGA yeah Vince is sleeping
yeah and and the best part of all of
this is that 10 and kingpin already know
what this GPU can do which we discovered
because 110 told us and - yeah - when I
just assembled the card the other day we
saw some blue Kington pasted on there
yeah which does not come stock yep so
they pre tested it
you feel pressure yeah we found out we
knew what their other yeah trying to be
sneaky yeah
okay so what's first Phil Phil smelling
- and then do a stock run full stock run
kind of Joe to reply to Elmo's messages
don't even know what that's about but
yeah okay yeah let's fill up - mom - all
right so first run will be complete
stock you went to milk I don't know if
you want I guess you might hurt yourself
I got it's kind of fucked up this is
kind of full so this is a some reason
yesterday 30 litres and we've got over
180 liters or with in the tanks to my
left side so we are good to go for the
full day and some
that hurt a little bit this time come on
speed up Steve there you go
cool down that card meds will fill up a
couple of those yeah just cool down in
the car cuz we're running out of about
43 right now just been sitting there
make sure it's right
I'm so good
all right so I guess I'll go over some
of these if you were in the stream
yesterday you're gonna hear a little bit
of repeat information right now but I'll
make it quick
Oh someone says well is this the one
with the screw and that they're all pad
that you open up have they lab I don't
know if it's that one specifically it'd
be funny if it was that would be funny
yeah that'd be funny if the screws still
in there did you know but what did you
not look at this no I mean it might be
on the beer I'm heatsink right now Oh be
short in it so that was actually tens
card ten reassemble that and ten is in
chat ten also is he still in cat did we
beat him up Bertie it was it was one of
the two main people working on this card
yeah and left a screw and a thorough hat
what here you assembled it that's all
good
whoops it shows that even even the
people designing the cards well they're
so tiny
yeah they're kind of ridiculous you if
you drop one and then try to find it
they're screwed on a ridiculous man they
should like include more smoothly like
an ex trust ya there's always extras
when I take no apart oh yeah so Ellen -
we call that professional yeah that's
right when Yin you know you don't need
them all so you just leave them house
right all right yes
have to admit the Carta isn't very
pretty I love this I love the heat SIG's
all right so are we gonna do a stock run
oh that's right yeah let's just get a
little cold we'll do a default make sure
you want me enable that would just go
completely stop yeah I don't know if the
default load line as I thought it says
level zero yeah I don't think that is
resetting properly but we'll leave it I
mean it could reboot if you want
Serena's your default run in the
meantime if you want to support the
stream definitely pick up one of the
large or medium mod match the medium has
a GPU teardown design on it and also has
basically the anatomy of a GPU label on
the math if you want to know where the
VRM components are things like that the
large one is 4 feet by 2 feet in freedom
units and you're gonna have to convert
that for me sorry that one is also back
in stock and no problems with telling to
not at all actually you ready no we're
gonna run that first one this is gonna
be a default run just to kind of see
what the score goes are we doing a full
benchmark on this yeah the way through
yeah full devote then we can see what
our improvement is when we run it high
so this surprise Tim's not saying we're
chicken clocking right now cuz
technically I don't think it is chicken
Clutton when you're at default 10 or
someone said use gloves guys should we
do this again briefly we did this
yesterday right as well so all right
let's do it briefly this stuff doesn't
really one you just don't let it soak no
don't let it so there's an effect
Leidenfrost effect you can look up if
you want to learn more about why that
happens but it's it's minus 1 or 96
degrees Celsius it basically evaporates
as soon as it hits something anything
anything yeah and the whole trick is not
the soap yes
view we we saw this again it's repeat
information if you saw yesterday but
we'll get it through quickly you pour it
in your sock or down your pant leg
you're gonna be hurting a lot so don't
do that you still have to soak like
you'd have to like pick up big and pour
it on right and like let it stick to
your leg yeah then you're in some
trouble but these are the gloves that
are rated for use with it you could use
like if you used leather workman's
gloves or just wear like smack these are
a bit difficult to work with on this
stuff and I feel like the risk is
actually higher from using it than not
yeah it's like I don't awkward I I can
barely fit my hand maybe they made like
a nice like thin one you know yeah
actually I can't even get my hand out of
there
yeah spill so that's how accidents
happen you try to be safe yeah so now
the gloves are not something we're
worried about yeah we usually use the
gloves for like when we're actually
pouring to the lower door because then
the hose gets basically really really
really cold I think he measured it
yesterday was what - 17 yeah so - yeah
it was close to minus 98 Oh - 90 so yeah
this transfer hose it freezes over and
it's actually it freezes over to the
point that as it gets colder and you get
all the ice on it you'll start hearing
it cracking
like yeah you'll hear the ice crack as
it freezes it's pretty cool so this one
when it freezes you you do not grab it
with your bare hands
no because you will get burns that's
what the glove is for and blisters yeah
glove or I mean I just use this piece of
cardboard yeah so we are being
technically somewhat safe sorta yeah
sort of but you gotta also imagine I've
been using liquid nitrogen
affectionately for 10 years that's the
century - yeah yeah decade now yes a
long time I think we're not gonna make a
video that was like all doctored up good
like the wig white cuz yeah like yeah we
should have done it actually get the
safety glasses I'm a little bit like how
do I see yeah it'd be kind of fun
what about eyes man just be careful well
it doesn't really bounce off like it
don't it's kind of difficult to get in
your eye don't pour it in your eyes yeah
alright so is this still the first pass
this is right yep I'm still going all
right cool kind of a long mitch mark so
we are let's see I don't where's our
notes from yesterday only open those up
prep notes so what we're doing right now
is a baseline now Nvidia cards are
extremely cold since like their
temperature sensitive so as you drive
down the temperature the clock will go
up naturally without even doing anything
which means that this isn't the stock
number you would get if you ran it with
the liquid cooler on it will have a
separate review of the KP card with the
stock cooler on it but our frequency
will be higher by nature of being zero
point six degrees Celsius right now but
it still giving us baseline so yeah I'll
see what that is TS or TSX running time
is my extreme extreme we wanted to kind
of take the CPU out of the equation
yeah so we're gonna do the extreme
versions extreme versions are usually
more GPU centric so yeah yeah I came too
late for the stream yesterday if I buy a
mod mat will you sign it like yesterday
we're not currently doing anything like
that like I said if I see a ton of
demand I'll open it up or something but
today it's just it's I think we well so
we did a over sign we over signed the
mousepads the the black and blue
mousepad specifically we over signed by
like 30 I think so if you buy the black
and blue mousepad during the stream
today there's a chance you'll get one of
the signed ones but there's no guarantee
at this point it's just we we signed
extra by accident so if you order in the
stream will ship it out if we have it
still if someone else hasn't beaten you
to it but I can tell you that as of
right now we do still have at least like
over 20 of them that are still signed by
both of us yeah so if you if you buy one
with a lot of signing yesterday yeah
actually we can you want to show some of
the pile right there there's
so yeah if you want to buy I want to be
as the black and blue mousepad we
weren't planning on signing again today
because Jo's got to catch a flight but
like I said we signed about 30 too many
of these so if you we don't have any
orders of these at least last that
checks a few minutes ago today so if you
buy one today you'll get one of those
and then we over signed the white and
blue by like seven
so there's less chance you get one of
those but they're also less popular so
if you want to pick one up they are
still there and we can ship them out to
you but we're not signing anymore once
those are done otherwise the mats are in
stock you have a cherry pick 20 atti
question mark well we think maybe it's a
sum or at least pretest at twenty atti
someone asked if we have a cherry picked
one I don't know if it's I'm not sure if
Nick's totally Jade but yeah but it's
protecting I think most of the ones that
you buy are actually bend from the
factory so even if you buy one you have
a good chance to have a good card that's
my understanding as well yeah so what's
our our baseline is let's let me take a
note of this a que flat all the way but
we really want to concentrate on is the
graphics Wars yeah what'd I miss seven
five seven seven 48.1 one and 44.4 eight
so baseline for gravity soars if you
want to the points is 75 77 we'll keep
an eye on that as we go all right so
what do we do next
overclocking yeah right not to go up to
where we left off so let's do uh yeah so
work up there you have to start there
let's oh I know I have to start up there
otherwise good cause this here you want
to start there yeah alright I think we
still have more in it there's more I
think we start like that was easy we
start up here somewhere okay we'll start
there yeah okay so we're gonna start a
start over clock in it start pulling
down anyway okay so Joe's gonna start
pouring talent to you putting the
temperature down where are you what's
your target right now
on it down I'm gonna do about - Andre
will start at that last - under we did
yesterday
ok I think is that round - 70 - 80 I
have to torch the pot right and what
that does is it basically helps the
metals soak in the liquid nitrogen more
so you can actually control the
temperature much easier so I just have
to bring it down to minus 70 where about
- 15 now so it's gonna take a little bit
yeah
since we're so hot we have pretty much
positive 5 and then we let's see we got
some super chat some comments so is I'm
just reading some some messages in chat
let's do this one so we got a super chat
in from ridiculous Prime $10 lovely the
livestream and keep up the awesome work
well thank you for watching them my
question similar to Titan r-tx do you
think the next-gen of nvidia cards could
come with higher capacity vram chips
depends on one the next-gen is and what
the memory technology as i guess
HBM is where you start seeing some
pretty high capacity but i have no idea
right now next-gen is not even on my
radar Arcturian is still pretty new so
yeah i'm not sure when we're gonna see
in something yeah I try not to speculate
on that stuff cuz and take that with a
grain of salt
I really don't know yes how much to
break a piece of paper
$10 chef Martin Parker I'm not sure no
break a piece of paper what happens if
you poor Alan to on paper is just
evaporate right probably I don't think
nothing I don't think it's gonna like
freeze or anything SPER the PWR
find out I Steve have you cosplay us Jon
Snow
now when Johnson was first appeared in
Game of Thrones I did get that
constantly my hair was a little bit
shorter too so I did I did get that
quite regularly funny we could do uh was
it coldness the guys that uh I can't
think of it right now I just remember on
the wall or we just do the I mean you
could be Thor Avengers is popular right
now and look at what is it it's the
raccoon that's right Hudson Vince is
like rocket racoon rocky raccoon yeah
paintin yes yes we got one to five or
one three for the office or for the
voltage yeah one three just checking
yeah so we're gonna use a 1/3 on the GPU
voltage then we're gonna go dry two one
five on the memory voltage and then on
the text about one point one one three
and we've gone to level zero for load
line which is gonna be the about the
flattest we can get it for voltage and
OCP is now off so now over current
concerns so that's done now I'm at minus
50 or so you don't want to do that
obviously on ambient temp so I'm cold
right yeah so uh per tens X steps guide
the maximum voltage that he kind of I
guess recommends is one point three
volts under the stock cooler and beyond
that it does it looks like this probably
not needed them yeah yeah well
so without the xoc BIOS and the testing
I was doing you're really not gonna
increase the voltage much because you
just start pulling away from the power
limit and there is a parallel it's 360
watts or something like that you put the
xoc BIOS on there and then this one's
got yeah I'm waiting it's immortal
put that xse BIOS on there and then you
have no power limit at which point you
can start increasing the voltage
increase stability without pulling power
away from before but you do still have
concerns of heat and AB lifespan so Alan
to helps us mitigate this next one all
right David J bar three dollars what are
you guys running for personal rigs you
want to start Joe I have a 18 cord
basically
pretty much similar this but an on KP
part so um I think I'm using that x2 99
OC formula okay yeah I think I do you
run it overclocked to your personal
system um a little bit there's a slight
overclock yeah a few months and then I'd
20 ATP I just a reference car I'm
actually right in the middle of
upgrading it to just I had it all kind
of ghetto fighters so I'm basically
going through it probably when I go home
and end up doing a full hard-line K I
got a bunch of good news for it so I
need out got a bunch of like nvme drives
and all sorts of good stuff I am running
I don't really use my home system so
like I'm always here so the office I
have I don't remember what it is
it's say do you remember
it's an X 99 motherboard and the CPU is
honestly I can't even remember I think
it's a I think it's an 8 core hyper
threaded so it's like 16 this time you
turn it on that's this one that's on
every day it really is but I mean it's
only using two channels for the memory
because it's like that's I didn't want
to pull ddr4 away from test systems so I
just put C channel 2 sticks in there sad
at home I've got an FX 83-70 that's
under clocked and under bolted because
the motherboard the vrm runs like a
hundred days I know
so how I under bolted it yeah yeah we're
gonna end up torching the POC about
minus 72
I'll do the - like 50 that's gonna be
allowed on the like yeah yeah
so this is torching the ellentube pot
which yeah what happens is if you don't
torch the pot when the heat basically
builds up on the pot you won't be able
to control it as easy so by torching it
it kind of allows you to allows the
middle to soak in the liquid nitrogen
quicker so you can just like pork and
keep it and kind of keep it more added a
certain temperature instead of trying to
fight the temperature all the time yeah
so true as one of the most important
tricks he showed me yesterday to has the
big one without that one I don't think
you would have gotten nearly as far no
yeah it's what most people don't realize
that you have to do and it depends on
the part I don't think Roman spots you
need to do it right on these pots but it
was it's nice because you can actually
depending on how much you torch the pot
you can get your own controlled feel
with it right okay I like to do it about
10 15 degrees and then it just gives me
a nice I could put it on put it on
you'll see when I'm about to run a
benchmark where I'll just reach through
- 65 ish and still going down yeah we're
gonna do about mice we can try and get a
shot yeah I said all the bolts and
everything already and I'm gonna
actually I want to set the clocks so
which one did you want to start out on
let's let's go conservative to start so
what are you you're a one point three
volts right now yeah Alan fine I can
drop it down if you want yeah let's come
up to like I'm thinking honestly I think
we start like a 150 offset or something
I'm gonna work up from there yes make
sure I said I okay so we went back them
one two five will do just do we'll start
with 1600 so memory let's start with
1500 just so we can see some of the
scallion differences so memory is mostly
going to impact gt2 and time spike
extreme and then the chorus like a 150 I
guess just look over you and we should
run gpu-z during this one just to door
during the next one
like the the frequency all right guess
the on-screen display works it's red 21
25 mm and gpu-z the only thing is I
don't know if OCD I see our OS do misty
yeah we'll try it see what happens if it
doesn't work well y'all attend he's in
chat tell him to fix it I'm gonna pull
down to about - I'm good okay sir -
seventy right now or goes deeper they're
going down another 30 degrees you don't
really need it for these clocks but no
we are very conservatively clocked right
now but we were very wrong no it's not
gonna be them I don't want to get too
cold because you can have some issues
with memory
there's probably getting wet so we got
John braaap 499 says hey man just walks
out ziti roast and when you said at
least you didn't create the 680 X I
laughed my ass off good stuff man so the
context there Corsair has a case called
the 680 ax that we didn't particularly
like and bad shit not well yeah of
course sir that had a a rep who wasn't
representing a company but who was at
the roast former boss of lioness and he
he deigns mantle I think we talked about
how how our contents puts him to sleep
or something which is fine yeah he I
think I just shouted back at least I
didn't make the six ATX well it is a
roast right this road is that the one of
this yeah that's pretty uh pretty good
back and forth so what happened there
crashed yeah I wasn't looking actually
enter so when I went over I was kind of
more managing the bots all right usually
what I like to do is like go for the
last box that I know of but he's making
me not do it so I blame Steve if you if
the card doesn't behave as much as we
want it to yeah just saying it looks
like we got couple orders and I'll shot
a couple of these out we had one from
Alan who picked up the the black and
blue mousepad so like I said we're not
signing them today but we do as of right
now still have a few that we over signed
and I think we've got I don't have an
exact kind of oh okay I'll keep an eye
on it but we have at least like 15 left
that are over signed remastered a so if
you do order a black and blue shortly it
looks like we've already sold through a
few of them
we have some left to order one shortly
it'll be signed by both of us then we're
not signing them again after that we had
an order from David from Michigan he
picked up a mousepad as well and we got
an order from hey Suz from Spain who
picked up a mousepad thank you for the
support on all that of course the story
and the super chats for the best way to
help us pay for the expense that is
liquid-nitrogen overclocking and we do
as I said have the mod mats back in
stock and shipping that's here so hey
don't let go if D didn't like the Asti
No get on that ten oops
time to fix it so on screen display not
likes man we should have named this
ripped in red Ted I see you've got any
twitter twitter anything
so we are running the kingpin 20 atti
and our base number for the score was 75
77 points for GPU and this should be
around 20 to 65 okay so on the core
itself because that's where we were kind
of for the frequency every frequency sir
for the frequency we should yeah I guess
we should note that too
so typically 20 ATT is run between like
1800 megahertz and 19 something maybe
when it's kind of a higher-end stock
stock clock model you start overclocking
at a lot of the 28 guys we have
overclocked I'm just stocked by a stock
cooling they stopped in the range of 20
50 megahertz to maybe 21 15 maybe but
typically I think we see it stopped
around 2050 so and this is already at
around 2200 Plus megahertz yeah and this
is our first I think the official was 22
65 when we tested yesterday yeah I'd
have to run in window mode so we should
do that at some point just to show gpu-z
when we bump it up the gal DGP okay and
then the I guess I'll know it as well
the GPU temperature reading then GPZ is
not functional these temperatures right
now once you start going well between
minus 40 I think that might be the
cutoff point if I remember correctly I
think it's around minus 40 yeah where it
can signal or just basically can't read
doesn't know it's an internal sensor
just doesn't isn't able to we got a
question from LOM 25 PLN thank you
any plans for EU store it takes one
dollar to ship a t-shirts from the UK or
Germany to Poland but our shipping is
more expensive than that well we are we
are not in the UK or Germany ahaha so it
is more expensive also we're not like
new Agri Amazon so our shipping isn't
subsidized and yeah it's much more
difficult not even yeah to even ship out
of the countries a lot of very difficult
yeah finding our shipping is pretty
pretty good for what for our size but
you got to figure like some like Amazon
a lot of the time their partner lose the
partners lose money or a borderline
losing money
shipments and we can't afford to do that
because we're not Amazon so I'm sorry I
would do the best we can for shipping
price but uh that is that is what we pay
is better than I'd say most though for
international scattered venture 7590
thank you
can you tell Joe to reply to all more
text messages you saw that one earlier
figure that out later I guess echo
Thomas $5 are you still signing mousepad
oh we got that one already while you're
doing that real quick goods on CP you
know nobody - dies what CPU is that this
is the ninety nine eighty actually you
don't me to poor at all no it's fine
okay
oh we're in CPU test right now so it's
the ninety nine eighty XE it's four
point eight gigahertz and I don't I
think voltage is maybe one point two
seven or something like that for core
one point nine five V sand and we're
just using this three sixty radiator to
cool a CPU so it's actually very simple
setup the point was just get something
easy he's no CLC for the CPU so we
control it easily and then Ellen - for
the GPU that looks like the CPU bench
will pass which is good cuz we set up
that a lot funny I think I just got
drunk text no it's not no more so yeah
the scatter bencher one and then we got
that's funny
coal miner denying so happy we're
getting on to testing just got my
kingpin and get me ready for water ties
in well that's awesome I did water
testing out already with the stock
cooler and it was honestly pretty fun to
work with
so 4:20 atti is in general I always end
up just disappointed and overclocking a
lot of them because you're so limited by
power no and you will get limited by
this eventually they do have a power
limit stock but on ax tabs you can pull
the xoc bonus if you want it and push it
a bit more you can remove the power
limit yeah I just be careful don't put
everything into the ll on to BIOS
because if you put it on the L into BIOS
and run it on water
you have no temp protection so you want
to run it into the middle bios that's
the OCC bio C yep because a temp
protection on our water is very
important because if it overheats if you
don't have ten protection and you have
actually killed the car also there's a
big note be careful with voltages - yeah
I order don't ya
tens guide officially I think does give
a number of not recommending not going
higher than one point three yeah I
highly recommend you read it read it
read it
yeah and read it in like maybe a couple
times because there's a lot of
information there so just to be careful
because it's an expensive card you don't
want to kill it but it is a lot of fun
to overclock that especially oh no I'm
do yes so you got a score you know one
take a note yes Sarah what was our
offset for this one fifty yep one fifty
and then 1500 mm yes 8922 for total
score which you don't care too much
about but that is a minor point
improvement
yeah but they 85 62 yeah it's so much
less that was annoying form on the
graphic score 50 408 that's a lot
actually
and 50 51 for gt2 so GT 1dc 2dc 2 tends
to be more memory focused and GT one's
more core focused versus memory our
improvement and I guess we'll run GPZ
for one of these so we can see the
frequency driver do you want me to do
this one and I'll just bump it yeah
let's do that
how much you want to bump encore we're
at 150 so you want to do like just 175
or something so the improvement in score
was about 13% from that a very low
effort overclock and we'll do is well
have gpu-z open and we'll run it in
windowed mode yeah
and then we can keep an eye on the GB
frequency memory clocks 20 125 megahertz
hmm I want to get it too cold
there's a lot of Vaseline on the card as
it is now that's why we're using it's
basically all the way back almost to the
power connectors because we actually put
the heat sinks back on just to make sure
because I noticed when you start getting
really cold the heat sinks will start
getting some ice on them and stuff so
you want to make sure you protect it all
right as much as possible so GPU GPUs
these open try to see if we have house
normal chat going I'm checking over on
chat ex devs 10 so size up is key
temperature but you can't measure it
easily that is definitely true we have a
thermocouple in the LNT pot in the
bottom of the pot we have one of his
there Mel couplers 2 which are actually
really on point
yeah kingpin I really only use them
they're kind of a pain because they're
so thick but they're really accurate I
mean I swear by them the I guess the
biggest thing to is how well they detect
a cold so yeah we use thermocouples that
are really really small they're
extremely skinny and the point is we put
them on like stock coin between the
mosfet and external pads you want it to
be skinny but for something like this
the hours I don't think are I don't
think they can detect quite as well
yeah these are just I mean they're yeah
you can't put in on anything tiny yeah
impossible to do but they're good for
Alan teapots yeah they're very good for
Alan to buzz Chad says we're doing very
well well I'm glad you selected dark 99
light 99 as your official spokesman for
a hall of the chat I do have by the way
some of the stuff linked below
just on Amazon or wherever so like the
these stanley cups we Israel into our I
like them a lot and then you just buy
any thermos for the one Joe's pouring
out of if you wanted to get into this
and also the kingpin icon
Alan teapot a links in the description
if anyone is really serious about it who
wants to to pick that up but yeah then I
mean the the new parts cut up for the
newer cards - I mean for the old cards -
but if I think the old one I don't know
if it comes with I don't even know if he
has any more of the old ones but or now
I didn't look on this site but the icon
is there is a nice part if you wanted
something cheaper though
the kingpin pasted over there the the
blue paste blue goo that we use on the
video card and on this I swear I have
some hidden my beard from yesterday I
could have sworn like a bunch went in
and you take a shower and just all this
blue yeah that's kind of weird
kind of awkward on a whole new level
[Laughter]
kiss where as 20 to 80 on the cord
running 20 20 to 80 okay no 22 in here
20 to 80 megahertz right now someone
complain about the background noise I
mean you know we've got loud fans
running and then we're pouring Alan too
so it's not gonna be like studio levels
of quiet sorry yeah it's kind of
difficult to work with we can keep our
keep our voices up a bit and that'll
probably help
apparently Linus is streaming water
pulling a mouse or something right now
but we're doing should we yell into a
mouse mouse I don't see there stream
maybe it's on Twitch or something
whatever well I looked for it sorry guys
uh hey Steve were the white and blue
mouse pads signed in black yes on the
white part in the top right corner away
from where you're going to be using the
mouse which one can pin here no no no
the one L Moore says scatter bencher
that one's a little drunky I don't see
it now oh I see yeah okay I see okay
cool so I too much base hood joke yeah
get it I don't either
and it's my voice that's your voice
super chats so got one from Silver husk
Oh two dollars how different taxes what
is the CPU for today it is a 99 ATF see
scattered venture Elmore says the main
reason you overclock higher with helium
is because it's funnier with the higher
pitched voice
that's a good answer for every time
someone says helium yeah cuz we get that
comment quite a bit yeah so scores we
got a score in 84 43 for the GPU score
what is that 175 and 1,500 yeah
so 84 43 it's actually lower that is
actually lower but that's because big
guys we're running in Windows we're
running windowed with gpu-z open yes not
really well actually I won't log that
one because yeah let's not log it but
our frequency was 20 to 80 megahertz
that's the part we care about just to
give people an idea where it was
yeah I would just bump up to another one
yes so 20 to 80 on a 20 atti is actually
very far from where we're gonna end up
today but much higher than he'll get on
every 20 atti
typically TARDIS getting frozen tell
that big guy to start actual
overclocking that's for max devs
yeah I know blame Steve should we do the
suite should we address the comment that
we were talking about this morning the
from liquid nitrogen overclocking is
pointless
what's the point oh my goodness so there
was a comment about we'll talk about
this more at Computex do I think
if I might plan but I think it's a good
idea yeah briefly though there's kind of
like what's the point of volunteer
overclocking you can't play games with
it and I think the response to that is
what's the point of playing games it has
the same point it's fun when you play
games you were actually and I don't mean
to make you feel bad but this is how I
feel too you are actually achieving
nothing so Enriquez playing games are
fun and this is just overclocking for
fun we are we too are functionally doing
nothing about your society right now so
to answer your question it's the same
thing it's the same thing yeah I love
that comment yeah
get that chicken run it
someone says get that chicken running
she can throw in some chicken clock in
frozen beard hair is the best hair so we
got a couple more orders thank you for
the store orders as always they help
significantly with streams so the
mousepads you got a blue and white and a
graft logo shirt thank you for that
order from Dale and the UK we got a see
Philip and Austria picked up a mod Matt
thank you for picking one of those up
it's a large bottom at the 4 foot by 2
foot mat with the ESD grounding strap
and connection to actual ground and a
lightweight Raglan hoodie which is our
two-tone hoodie got another one from
Kevin in Norway just like yesterday all
over the world that's always really
really cool to see that yeah so Kevin in
Norway picked up a blue and black mouse
pad and then cobalt blue beer glass from
us I think there is actually a good
amount of interest there's there's good
amount of interested more signs mouse
pads do you want to try and I'm gonna
try and sign them before you go to the
airport do more today
Jerry why not okay I have to be careful
about not overselling what we have but
we have a limited amount of stock here
before Jolie is but I'm so okay I'll
keep an eye on the inventory and
actually I'll just set the end that's
right now to make sure we don't sell
beyond what we can sustain today but I
guess there's enough interest here I
didn't think that many people would care
but if you want to pick up a mouse pad
again the adjust the blue and black I
only really have blue and black I have
like 50 extra white and blue here so you
order it will sign it but only up until
50 blue and black I've got a bit more of
so I have like 300 and 120 of them or
something so we should be good so you
pick one of those up we'll both sign it
at the end of the stream
and ship it out to you I did not know
there was that much interest in him so
he loves mousepads bro
they were very popular yesterday I just
figured I figured on people watching us
they'd be watching today but it might be
a different crowd my hands gonna hate
Jim oh yeah that could be taken a lot of
different ways now that will be clipped
out of context later and they'll regret
saying it awkward so let me adjust the
inventory here to make sure we're good
to go and if you do pick up a mousepad
we'll go ahead and sign it thank you for
the continued interest in those but we
are that should be that puts us well
within stock so all right yeah so if you
pick up a mousepad especially black and
blue we will sign them today
all right times pi is running yeah it's
about to finish up front and cpu test
CPU test right now
what's your offsets I jumped it up 25
from the last one which one so we round
the core 200 offset now free enough 25
megahertz hi Josh oh I'll find it in a
second we should talk about memory - you
want to talk about a why memory
overclocking that's important on this of
it I guess
well it's the type of modules that are
on the card the Samsung modules are way
more are way better than the originals
they also help on the own too - are we
blowing last time oh yeah from the
previous score their abs core was a 150
offset 1500 as previous when I logged
you're a t56 now we're at 200 and that's
increased not it's perfect okay cool
now it's a windowed mode cool so you
want to keep track of what it is yes I
take a note of that so this was a plus
200 offset yep 1500 memory everything
else the same
and then 1944 which is a bit of an
increase not much 86 95
54 84 84 and then 51:36 51:36
I always got a concentration concentrate
on the frames
yes the framerate actually is a very
important here to keep track of because
as Joe chicken cluck ensure was
exploring yesterday well the big thing I
guess was trying to make sure what we're
doing is affecting the right thing yeah
so for memory overclocking you were just
running GT to back to back right yeah
gt2 seems to be much harder that's where
the issues were coming through so right
if I ran gt2 I could run GT one pretty
easily so I was just testing to kind of
make it quicker yeah instead of messing
around with GT one no he's passing in
the gt2 failing I must have just run GG
too so it's kind of what I was doing so
what was what are we doing now - one -
25 let me update this text mousepads
bought during stream will be signed okay
so that's up to hit it thank you again
for expressing the interest like I said
I wasn't going to continue that today
but we'll go ahead and do it cuz it'll
work a lot of people who wanted to make
sure they get one so before Jo flies out
we will sign more of them okay what's
chat saying can the mod match function
as a good mousepad it we don't advertise
it as a mouse but it's not it's got a
really grippy surface which is meant for
just like holding screws they and you
drop a screw in it basically stays in
place which is really nice but it is
super grippy clearly we're using the
mouse on it and it's like you can find
but we I wouldn't say buy it for that
purpose and I want to buy one of our
mouse pads that's signed by us and put
that on top of the mama hat but yeah the
I guess dealt with trouble yeah I guess
if you want to use it as a mousepad
basically expect some rolling resistance
so if you like those like aluminum rough
mouse pads then you might be fine with
it which one you're eating
let's go 2,400 won 3-1 hundred guys we
already noted it's not like we haven't
read it before what is he saying he now
he wants us to go to 2,400 okay so he's
kind of like he's come on right all the
way tin just wants to go to bed is what
do you want yeah well yeah it's like
2:00 a.m. are we have a whole stream to
run
just do everything and then say we're
done yeah we already went over this ten
come out here distress dream this is the
best Joe knows how to build suspense
I've been waiting on part two of his
overclocking videos for us though so
true that's actually really good that is
awesome what now that's true I'm
actually gonna be working on that next
week so speaking of Joe's overclocking
videos so I do have Joe linked in the
description below for bearded hardware
and you should subscribe to him if you
have not already he is his link down in
the description or you can if you want
to support Joe while you're supporting
so you can pick up our our mouse pads on
stored I can't access dotnet I'll try
and shout your name out there in the
stream no guarantees on that but we will
be signing them after the interest surge
will be signing up today and then Joe
has this shirt on bearded hardware calm
if you want to support Joe
man you got that you got that a
marketing game on point I had tre I need
a hat need a hat yeah that's my next
thing oh I get the sweatshirt done but
one thing at a time
is the Hat can I have a beard on it yeah
that's why I'm just gonna have the real
owner will be flipped upside down or is
having sideway a kid I feel some more
talent here and the beards not included
by the way no but you should include
like you know what you need to do is get
a really big sponsorship with like
Dollar Shave Club tell them tell them
you'll shave your beard for like a
middle yeah like a million dollars I'm
not sure you want to see that there's a
whole lot of awkward there's a reason
why I haven't you
and I'll probably never shave it get
that that babyface overclocking yeah I
died drop at least like 15 years oh yeah
come on much more can be annoyed Ken
significantly I would imagine Joe's
overclocking is as good as my timing for
shipping Steve this is timing for what
is shipping stuff to you Roman
oh yeah I would say that yes it's in
chat let's rip Roman where is he there
Bowers inch either one say hi to there
Mary he's on YouTube as well they should
check my go google dr acht a you ER
there Bower and oft being 8 just to be
clear there he said yeah jos
overclocking as good as my time there
shipping stuff to steve think we're
going on three months three months yeah
three months what is he sending you
something magical uh one carbo not oh is
that what you're waiting for just
personally make even he's been so in it
by hands together see that's worse than
my part two or they over card man
just saying Rowan's roman school guy
will hopefully a sea rowing at Computex
in the next couple weeks actually will
all be in taiwan you're gonna be there
to hopefully nylon yeah I'll be at copy
decks yeah so I'll be at the G skill
booth for the overclocking competition
one of the judges that's right this guy
judging yeah I'll actually be covering a
bunch of the the contest so on my
channel during Computex you'll see a
bunch of overclocking hardcore and me
judging and messing around yeah which I
love to do I'm planning to come film
some videos with the extreme
overclockers so you'll see you'll see
Roman on our channel again unfortunately
yeah
so I'm sure I'll start you ready yeah
listen 90 135 for total score yes what
is our frequency right now 25 more now
225 1591 30 was trying to piss tannin
off 87 93 55 54 to do 187 all right cool
all right let's chicken cluck some more
so that is just to kind of make sure
people appreciate this you know we're
approaching 20 300 megahertz at this
point without really any effort yeah not
much temp either about my it's 50 yeah
60 yeah and I'll point out again that
saw whirs and cracks is that past minus
40 so yeah I don't really look at that
yes 4 minus 56 right now and where you
where you bringing it down to when
you're actually running what's your
target same thing yeah it's just around
the same thing okay we're not pushing it
too hard I'm gonna probably start
increasing I don't want the car to get
too cold right cuz then we'll have a
bunch of issues usually I start off much
higher but that wouldn't be fun on the
stream so yeah it's the anticipation in
the stream that makes you watch the
whole thing so just say pleasure you
almost you get to see me fail get to see
you fail yeah that's all Roman wants to
see oh of course
and cherry now oh yeah they save I think
is Rowan talking about their whole taste
right now I saw him say just these 10
grams per application and you're good
mmm I mean we do it well I guess if
you're the business of selling their
whole horse better
yeah just advertise it more just use
more oh nice pace and chat so as gamers
axis is dangerous bought a t-rex pot
last night and I'm trying to be sensible
and not go crazy an order of 20 atti kbe
that's right not to yeah try not to
order the kpe but you know it's a good
starting point if you haven't done Alan
to your overclocking before this is my
first time doing Alan
gpo and I'm not even doing anything it's
yeah that's for sure if it's your first
time we're talk about this yesterday you
you might want to maybe get one of your
old video cards you're not using anymore
or buy a used one on eBay or something
yeah I'm not sure you want to break your
overclocking virginity I like me brand
new cage and then ya know I would first
work with something else I would still
buy the campaign cart cuz it is a badass
cart but yeah I'm not sure I'd I'd be
very careful I because it is possible to
kill it I mean you do something wrong or
you get it you don't insulate right and
card goes poof and yeah me BJ is not
gonna be responsible for it no so
actually do you know what the you know
that ten password protects the xoc bios
you know he sets the password - oh no
it's so I installed the xoc BIOS on here
so that we could do this with no power
limit and it comes in a password
password detective director or whatever
file format and the password is I
promise not to RMA this card or
something really good
ten Zoe's created basically basically a
signed agreement at that point and
basically if you gonna put this on air
you're screwed yeah yeah what is the
keyboard in the middle someone wants to
know about your case was my keyboard
I've had this thing for like eleven
years something like that it's an IBM
stink pad it's basically just a ps2
keyboard I don't even use the mouse it
just it's just functional for just for
overclocking doesn't change it and stuff
it's very portable - yeah I can throw it
in the backpack and it's not an issue
it's not like oh look it's just a
convenient thing I brought it Taiwan
like hundreds of times seems like yeah
like we said previously well when you're
bringing stuff to Taiwan it's quite
difficult I mean I always load up - I
always bring up too much stuff well you
got a-you got the balance to make sure
you have enough clothes for being in a
really high humidity place for over a
week I'm used to that because we're
either Florida very similar actually
yeah I think they're like the same spot
on the equator what does Roman saying
Romans talking so and he says we
actually decided to replace cryo not
completely instead so it will stay the
same name
we'll have better performance some are
already out in the wild all by end of
2019 yeah I think that he has a new face
- oh cool I look forward to getting it
and maybe like 20 25 or something
when Rowan can get around the ship in
the next package I was probably gonna be
more like 20-30 yeah
Rowan and Chet uh let's see
super chats get some of those oh yeah
like I say I got to get Roman on camera
for uh for Computex too so we'll try and
find something cool at his booth to show
off start off the video and one of three
potential languages like we always do
see if I can throw off maybe start with
Stefan you're giving him hints now yeah
I don't want to lead yeah you can't give
him too much info cuz you know you're
gonna try to prepare that's right he's
gonna study as German make sure he
remembers it reply to me v gates they're
Bower Boston box to avoid who's our last
one we read Dan Pellegrino $11 I
recognize that name love the stream I
scared for the MS I shot glass that's
why I recognize the name
I keep at it guys we need good XOC
content like this well thank you for
watching and glad that you got the shot
glasses we had a massage sent us and
everyone else shot glasses for a holiday
thing and it was like I didn't get one
I'm just kidding it's like I don't I
don't really want these but I don't want
to throw them out there someone can use
own they're kind of cool I can so we
sent them out to someone in our patreon
this court awesome Roman says ha ha ha
ha oh gosh he's doing freaking out here
10 is where is mr. banana my boss is
telling me my V chord I know buddy I
don't well I thought it was dim for sick
hey Steve do you know do you know
whether a von murdered - after that joke
during the roast I'm concerned he's been
replaced
I think they were fine after that it
wasn't it was a little difficult to
watch particularly Yvonne and -
take these down real quick yes 91 86 for
the total score what's our 250 offset
1500 memory any 186 250 250 offset okay
and 88 51 55 83 55-27 so just to give
point of reference let's get a close-up
on those scores if you don't mind -
Andrew behind the camera and then our
original baseline no overclocking just
cold which doesn't fluence the score was
that 75 77 for the total GPU score so 88
51 versus that is an improvement thus
far about 17 percent and then gt2 alone
we're at fifty five point two seven FDS
verse is our original score baseline at
forty four point four eight and that
improvement is about twenty five twenty
four percent then finally gt1 we're core
intends to 55.8 3 FPS move to from forty
eight point one one eight three forty
eight point one one so that is an
improvement about sixteen percent so
we're gonna jump to 275 275 i would like
to get another gpu-z shot at some point
maybe on the next bump to show that yeah
three notes in well yeah we could do it
now ten says I'm waiting I he says I am
all waiting for twenty four hundred
megahertz all up all of the towels all
the temp yeah we did what way well I'm
not gonna say but I knew that was gonna
happen with him just saying
all right so what do we have for super
chats I'm trying to keep up better today
than yesterday I'm doing okay so far you
had a tough time yesterday Oh yesterday
was a lot of super chance to keep up
with brutal we should go over it let's
go over after I get a couple of these
let's go over the test bench the bench
components again and share some of that
off now that it's frosty so we got
unexpected at 1440p five dollars five
euros thank you very much for the
support for paying for some of our Alan
TOS weekend
oh that is the OC keyboard from Joe now
it's getting really serious that is
right that's right when that comes out
Rene Rene $2 so much backseat OSHA here
Oh in the chat yeah I don't even know if
that was on the Cho
enjoy your OC streams thank you scatter
bencher $30 well if you didn't Hardware
be at G skills copy tax booth without a
doubt and judging and judging the
competition as well and people it's not
just people that you judge now I'll be
doing some benching to with you VGA to
nice job on EVGA day on EVGA day so it
should be fun 10/10 wouldn't come out
and do it you'd better be there actually
I don't know act I think you will be
there yeah ok 10 appear at the booth
send me an email then let me know if
you're gonna be at Computex at all
otherwise will come see you guys in the
OC lab or something I'm still waiting
for my invite 10 Joe in our bag over the
camera bag good luck with that
thanks maybe a big camera bag twisted
hardware $2.00 Steve snaps fingers - I
don't feel so good
Joe kalasa 5 guys saw a bid from a big
youtuber Jane not sure he said card salt
by AMD and NVIDIA our bend and usually
perform better is this true there's no
real what was it what was the question
our cards sold by Andy and Nvidia Bend I
can tell you with absolute certainty
that that is not true with the ante
cards and it is probably minimally true
with Nvidia cards well I wouldn't
they've been I mean
still have to check each GPU be pretty
selective select yeah yeah I wouldn't
say Bend I know say for instance like
the kingpin cars I I'm pretty sure
they're going through GPUs to make sure
it's a high quality enough for the card
yes because it is a it's a killer card I
mean that's not the only good thing
about the car you don't put a garbage
GPU yeah why would you want to buy all
that money for a good GPU and it be a
crappy g1 ebj to is spending a lot of
money like for the PCB of the vrm and
all that's yeah yeah yeah why wiping it
down but like Nvidia and AMD reference
directly no not that is not really true
actually we have a video coming up on
that hopefully before Computex I mean
you're like two more before I move on to
fill in some Allen to you for Joe NZ
Odin what is the madrina sponsored roast
of Steve going to happen probably never
because we don't have the shell skills
of Linus to somehow figure out how to
turn the word roast into an
advertisement just for coffee that's
pretty pretty good skills
paul dodd my god forget signing can I
get a strand I'm Steve's hair or Joe's
beard if I buy a hot Matt also why
didn't Steve sing when Joe did because
we don't yeah
nobody some things in life just should
not be done Alan to it so we're at 23 85
for the frequency yep so we're almost
twenty four hundred megahertz can you
can you make sure we torture 10 as much
as possible and get like what should I
do like
$23.99 I will definitely do them just to
have fun we could do it yeah so 2385 for
the frequency so far is me damn high
again the these cards 28 et eyes that is
without any special bios or anything
typically stopped at around 2050 maybe
sort of towards 2100 so we are much
higher than lead to the
yeah you won't see that on water ever no
no definitely not
if not you're doing something wrong yeah
its software's bug it just doesn't work
so we got a store order from Emily and
New Hampshire picks up a mousepad thank
you got an order from Jeff in British
Columbia picked up a mousepad as well oh
you read another one and an order from
David and Philadelphia picked up a black
and blue mousepad thank you like I said
well sign those up until we run out of
them today I have set the stock so that
we can't sell more than we can sign so
once it's out of stock and you know that
we're out it's just it won't be
restocked until Joe goes home and then
they won't be signed after that but it
looks like we do have a enough of them
left for this stream hopefully yeah I'm
gonna look good right now there's
probably no reason to take this score
down so okay what would you run for this
one just GPZ yeah I ran the jacuzzi just
to make sure that we're doing it because
it's gonna be lower rose obviously so
how do we mess with and more than usual
well while you figure that out let me go
over the bench components over here sure
so let's show off the KP card as best we
can it's kind of buried under stuff but
Alan teapot up here is frosted over
right now and we've got blue shops how
actually what chef I've actually linked
list in the description because I
figured why not if you want to pick up
blue shop towel to boots blue shop
towels like is like the hardcore
overclocked towel yeah they're amazing
like you could do a lot with them this
is actually I know put down the blue
shop that's right that's right there's a
lot you gonna do with them the server's
got the KP card with the the VR and
heatsink still on it they're actually
pretty cool to the touch right now and
the fan is not spinning because it
doesn't need to the whole card is really
cold what do we add a readout for
temperature on there about - 95-98 I
started pulling it down a little bit
more cos we're starting to pick up on
clocks right and the thermocouple so
it's coming in back here you can't
really see it from that angle but it's
the thermocouples going in under the
Allen to pot like that
it ends up right behind the GPU which is
back here and actually you can see where
the GPU is by looking at where the big
rectangle of frost is yeah I'm the fact
of the card so that's roughly where the
GPU is I said I tried to set 14 but we
read it round it up we're at 2,400 2,400
yeah I'm not you hear this though and
just actually do a real run though so
the rest of the bench I've just thrown a
titi flow 360 on here because it was
easy and I needed a 360 to get a basic
4.8 gigahertz overclock Lanai 98 Exe
I'll take credit for this one so Joe has
been doing all the GPU stuff here today
I did set that over o'clock last night
and we've got memory at 4000 megahertz
CPU the mash is that I think I stopped
at 3200 for now and so we're pretty
happy with that CPU base overclocked
with just water try to unseat Royals for
the memory over talks pretty well x2
night I dark for the board and then two
power supplies so this might interest
some of you yeah we always do one power
supply her so she under carded in the
extreme car yes
so this 1600 watt corsair power supply
is only for the GPU and that's plugged
into its own circuit 20 amp circuits so
we're not going to trip that and then
the CPU 99 ATX II is is certainly a
power hog on its own as plugs into a
1600 watt EVGA power supply also plugs
into its own circuit and then to get
them to work together it's buried back
there but actually it's right here this
we just plugged in a jumper I mean you
could do this with a paperclip
it's basically what this is but it's
just a jumper and it bridges the two
pins so it's a green pin and then a
ground a black pin you bridge those two
and the power supply will start when you
have the power button and Joe I guess
the trick here is you want the GP power
supply on first first yeah otherwise
that it's just not gonna I don't know if
there's an issue there shouldn't be an
issue with in this setup I know with
older cars there was some issue if you
didn't do that you could blow something
but you obviously you can't compute into
the operating system if the card is not
on right and it will it will do some
when it's reading in the BIOS to try to
detect the card it won't read it so you
need to make sure you do the Jeep
first and then the motherboard second
right right
Andrew you got in any scratching on the
mic from Joe's beard okay cool
I saw it hitting the mics just making
sure so then the rest of the setup I
guess is all just the L&amp;amp;T stuff and it's
not too bad really we have three of
these I think they are 16 I don't
remember how many Adam that's more than
16 ounces I don't know how many no there
were definitely more than 16 then we
have a 30 liter Dewar over here to 180s
time I'd be like 32 or something no to
180 liter hands do not microwave really
how would we put one of these in a
microwave do that so it warms Allen two
of them it's throw one two and then
throw it all in the microwave I'll be a
great video so the Spartans been slowly
leaking we talked about this yesterday
but again Allen two cylinders there to
some extent supposed to leak because
they're pressurized smell explode if
they don't there's too high pressure but
this one's damaged and the inner
container constantly shifts yeah I got
mad before and I had done it did that
yeah that's right I threw it not really
like I said like I said in the prison
video yeah not really
yeah and then uh the best ones almost
empty I think the other one is
completely all those we're in good shape
for today and I might have some extra to
do another one of these after Joe leaves
so be all on my own Joe would be fun
I'll be watching then you can be in chat
oh I'll be critiquing you given me yeah
talking trial be the tin let's have a
chat to Bauer
what is someone says no enthusiast uses
AMD junks lmao okay so that mentality is
so bad like cuz people do that on both
both of the the components you get like
the AMD fans who do the same thing I'm a
performance fan we just so I guess like
to say no enthusiast uses Andy you've
got build Zoid in the chat who like does
a lotta AMD xoc we just did a.m. - yes
we just today a.m. the rise on the
extreme overclocking yesterday you know
Joe I think it's time to admit that
we're not enthusiasts no where are we
then posers probably actually just like
just like Roman just like Roman he's a
big poser now doesn't bench anymore
there's a bench anymore raking and all
of that all that thermal grisly throw
that's funny driving his GTR sometimes
in the woods sometimes correctly we all
been there
they're very clean says dishwasher born
with dishwashers someone I guess they're
talking to chat about how to clean these
you know we should mention that too so
we've got the video card under a lot of
Vaseline for insulation purposes yeah
there's a lot of us we know to make sure
there's no no none of the water from the
LNT pot drips down on short stuff should
note that score yeah let's do that real
quickly what is our one what's our
offset I would just put it's basically
289 I was trying to get okay $23.99 59
it'll round yeah so I'm just gonna go to
300 now 90 to 69 I'll do 325 just what
were the score is 90 to 69 total
although ones are just throwing me down
Joe 89 70-56 49
and 5305 our gt2 went down that time how
much them to FPS - yeah ooh it could be
a bad sign
sometimes when you get too cold or
you're benching too long usually what we
want to try to do as bench it as quickly
as possible but we can't do that on
street sorry
a lot of the times the memory can start
getting flaky with all the cold it just
basically just water build-up and right
so their power is still in chat if you
don't know their bearings go subscribe
to the subscribe to the XO see guys on
YouTube it's a good community that's
been growing so there Bauer's got a
channel actually hardcore overclocking
has a channel he does some of the PCB
analysis on our channel Joe's got a
channel bearded hardware and we'll be
posting that what's your next video
playing apex yeah the part to the
motherboard not the game apex yeah yeah
I'm the motherboard yeah yeah the
overclocking guy we're gonna go over CPU
clocking and then memory clocking nice
so so if you want some is it gonna be
like tutorial style or just explanation
of what the settings are probably a
little bit of both just kind of show you
and then explain how and kind of just
give you a tips on what you need to do
did in memory quality right cuz most
people if I tell you okay you can do
this this and this you don't know how to
do it so yeah you just also an
introduction to Mary clucking in general
of what you need to do like I won't give
you too much info but yeah it'll be good
I've talked to a couple bunch of guys
I'm like yeah what how would you explain
it how would you think cuz I don't want
to make it too couple memories memory I
think is pretty hard to that's that
seems like kind of the last barrier
where people well the problem is is you
can go way too in-depth and then you
kind of lose a person yeah I think of
you started talking like tertiary time
yeah it starts reading a guy that I see
tertiary too much pure like yeah I don't
wanna watch that alright
the whole point is to try to make it fun
and interesting and which is very
difficult to yeah I know pretty much
every youtuber protect yours tried to
examine every and it's just not that
good it's not easy though like it's more
of an overclockers perspective of like
kind of how do you overclock like we get
into starting today yeah we did a memory
timings for primary and secondary I
think video with animations
and that was really good but even that
you know we had to cut it after
secondary and split everything off into
a separate video yeah you get too
complicated so that's why I'm gonna try
to dumb it down and just give you the
basics that you need to go shouldn't be
hard to dumb it down
I'll remember that sure he'll remember
for copy fax no trust me I've seen Joe
throw Ellen to that people oh I've been
known to do that a bunch okay
swish you down your shirt Hey the back
counter from John for the UK become a
mousepad thank you like it said we will
ever seen the interest originally in
this stream will sign what we have and I
have set the stock to equal the amount
of pads mouse pads we have here to sign
so if they're out of stock then that's
it we'll sign everything up until that
point so Joe and I will get those before
another end of the day no my hands gonna
hate you Jer bear says no he's just
talking someone else okay talking to
Richie Cece in chat dude good fella he
is too good for us
ha interactive boring man not really
[Laughter]
Paul died free oh I got that one already
bazinga X $5 how a lot of you own the
war between you and Paul me after his
video well I will see him at Computex
and then you won't see him again
next one Johnny Austin Norwegian kroner
fifty I think I'll buy a sign mod mat
and mousepad right now on stream if you
promise to grow beard at rest of the
year Steve I think you should I'm not
gonna do funny if it's annoying as is
it's not dairy M two dollars best way to
get Tim off of a throne paste off of the
mod match fries with Ellen - question
mark we have some on this map bottom not
that frizzy that's gonna no I just see
that seemed to work pretty well yeah I
was kind of impressed it's over here
I'll grab it right
so Joe is doing this I I'm not going to
so first of all a quick note I don't
know officially if this will cause any
damage to the pant but we don't think of
those if you wipe it off right away
KPS pace is gone yeah I had some issues
on mine so I was like you know what
seriously I use it for paste on
motherboards and you yeah well I mean
memory slots and everything I was like
where come on man that's it a pretty
good job it actually does work pretty
well I do have to I'll do some more
testing and we'll talk about it in a
video at some point so the official
answer is don't use it yet until we test
right because the that actually has been
a common question of how to clean the
mod mat because people get thrown paste
on it better than that everything else
all right what's your score 93 13
original total score was 8,000 won for
point of reference so quite a bit
improved and 89 87 for GPU originally we
were 75 77 do you do that percent
difference math on that 56 91 52 89 so
we have gone down on the memory score
yeah the gt2 is probably because of I
think we need to push the clocks up to
1600 okay let's do it I am what was your
office at this time uh help test cos I
get over I think the cold is starting to
affect the memory it does that it
actually does it with less with Samsung
memory so we have Samsung memory on
these cars which is like a huge
come on Senate fit box better oh yeah we
better even on air so we got we're at
325 so you want to go - we're gonna go
to 350 next yes
where's that can you bring that up real
quick I just want my beer so yeah so
we're gonna go up to 1600 memory this
time yeah you're 50 I like 1,600 it
seemed to work much better yesterday
you're limiting me Steve
yes yeah you're limiting me I get you
some lnto while you're being dramatic
I learned from watching Roman man
Rowan's just taking a beating today feel
bad for him so much fun to mess with him
he likes to mess with us too I think I
do have is it in the description I do
though Rowan can't be too mad they have
cryo not link in the description so if
you want some of the high-end thermal
paste that I used for our overclocks you
can click the thermal grizzly cry or not
link in the description and the bonus is
you support Roman at the same time
because he's gonna need a lot of cryo
not after all these burns were giving
him today
you put the crowd out of here
so we're at minus 105 now was it plus
400 minus 105 and what was the plus 400
oh nice
okay come on math Steve math from what
the previous offset I don't know what
our frequency was previously so if you
do full of wonder yeah you know what the
frequency was last time I didn't check
we'll do it on the next one I'll do a
quick run with Jacuzzi on the back I'm
gonna do that gt1 does I'm gonna shut
tent tent up and chat he says these
chicken Clockers which is my new
favorite word these chicken Clockers are
missing the airflow around the card so
just for you ten I'll hook up a fan from
one of your competitors careful though
too much movement yeah that is true
is there a fat screwdriver over there
there was then I moved it over there
yeah
can't have that for the string girl
okay so we're adding a maglev 120 fan
and this is just gonna help exhausts
that on two for one right into my face
and when you take it off yesterday Oh
cuz we were put in take a buccal I was
singing a photo yeah
thumbnail photos yes we had that
yesterday and then Steve had to ruin it
in
are you happy ten he's always happy
because he's picking on that just
subscribe to bearded hardware someone
says we he says it's going the wrong
direction well I was trying to exhaust
though until do we know do we not care
about it exhausting at this time you've
got to push air into the card well I'm
not sure why we would really would say
it if you feel these these are so it's
all cold right yeah
that's like I don't think I'm worried
about air flow on the well maybe it's to
keep the water off is that what it is
maybe curious why she was running fine
last night he says no wrong fan
direction
oh poor ten it's so much fun chicken
o'clock
why not turkey o'clock duck clock or
Goose club why not
dodo clubs chicken clucks are over I
agree and what is the total power
consumption not sure actually we should
have hooked up uh because II will tell
you I don't know how accurate yeah but
I'd rather do it from the powers of wall
well if we shut down we can do that but
yeah I wouldn't do that because then the
card will get really cold so ten actual
question for you do you know if GPU ZZZ
power consumption reader is accurate
under the setup if it is well just open
that up to get the power and because I
kinda want to check the clocks anyway
yeah we can go over it and see
ten says I'll suffer tomorrow and Vince
watches this we'll do a recap to you
we'll have a stream recap later with all
the end results
how much were your two tanks with Ellen
- and where were they from
so the Ellen - after I get up getting
discounts that were significant and it
was just cuz they overcharged me
originally each one was $177 before like
the delivery and the taxes so together
they came out to $440 originally it's
from air gas originally they wanted to
charge me an 880 and magically out of
nowhere it was cut in half because I
think they realized the co SPSS so yeah
170 bucks for one of them and your local
welding supply company can get them to
you if you want a cheaper if you don't
want to go like this if you don't need
this much you can get a Dewar like that
one over there 30 liters and that is
even gotta be used for like 400 bucks
maybe that was brand new for 600 you buy
me just clean them out first and then
you can bring that to your welding
supply company and ask them to just fill
that and that'll be much cheaper and
it'll last you like all day depending on
the temperature you're dealing with has
10 commented power consumption at 2.4
gigahertz
oh nice he's just giving us the numbers
yeah that's even better so 10 says GPZ
is not accurate at this point yeah I
figured as much
yeah and he says power consumption at
2.4 gigahertz r-tx KPG is about a
thousand watts what no my last buck was
350 so he says it's about a thousand
watts of the card and the 99 a DXE at
4.8 will be about 500 watts so we're
doing about 1500 watts between the two
which is good that we have two separate
power supplies on two separate circuits
eat anymore no I think I'm good for him
it's from that chicken clock that I'm
forced to do so Steve's fault we can
start picking it out I only read some of
the super chess it's just all and I was
complaining I'm not reading them we
don't have oh the page just refresh it
more than I thought how many read
through like I'll spend maybe the next
minute or two doing these that's rigged
in two dollars YouTube gave me a free
super chart
okay well bestie is well thank you very
much will will absolutely take the money
from YouTube I still have to look into
the free super chats from YouTube I
didn't yeah someone mentioned that
yesterday yeah I didn't know they did
that but hey I mean if you have YouTube
premium and you get free super chats not
complain by all means go with the house
hi Jesse Mackenzie if I've died does
tort I was a good one for you job does
torching the pot compensate for any
contraction that would cause a loose
seating or does it not contract enough
to affect anything no it's not it's we
torch really to basically just to
control the puppet er that's kind of the
short some of it right so the thing is
you gotta be careful also on how much
you torch because you also build up ice
okay
yeah turning it into water yeah and then
that goes into the pot and then actually
causes problems between fortunately it's
a bit easier to empty this than those
CPU pots yeah hold the cards pull the
card heat it up real quick turn it
upside down yep yeah we're starting to
have issues now so while you yeah some
of that I'll take a couple more these
super chats and Andrew now actually that
might be it Andrew if you want to train
the camera on what Joe's doing I'll read
through these and they can keep an eye
on the settings he's applying
yeah I'm just raising the volts to 1.3
we're at one point two five so Theo and
earthy Olander said one dollar no
message thank you Tim donate one dollar
no message and thank you and Thursday
two dollars thank you scatter badger
75 about Taiwan dollars is Joey using
the Elmore Labs EVC to 4x OC I think the
answer is no today
am I using it ever or yeah you know I I
need to talk to about getting one though
biking with Panda $2 nice hair did you
get it from cable mod boomer host you
got me
boom roast the better than Linus's Revis
not me Charlie lion equals king bank
loan question mark crispy I don't I
don't know if you're the coal keeper
sorry sorry
crispin driver Schroeder what I did I
did you see a 5,000 megahertz memory
support for Rison 3000 I did not see
that and I'm trying not to read the
rumors on it yeah you can't remember
there's a lot of rumors yeah I remember
what at CES everybody was talking about
that and then it was I mean it wasn't
that much of a disappointment but it was
kind of like well that's the problem is
people get all heights on the rumors and
then the company isn't aligned there yes
to the rumors yeah obviously so people
get disappointed because they built
themselves up or something that wasn't
ready to happen yet and like I I have I
will say that I've seen a lot of in the
last time where the issues yeah I'm
gonna have to eat up the corner okay
I've seen a lot of incorrect numbers
about rising 3,000 last few days so I
guess keep that in mind yeah we're gonna
basically kill it
okay so your gun you want to actually
try I'm gonna heat up first to see you
okay
yeah what I'm gonna do is heat up the
the card is very cold I'm gonna try to
go to minus 50 right now okay then try
to see if it's a based issue or
something the card it just people
might kill your mic for a second thanks
very much I'd say your mics off for a
second all right
so JW Dickie 10 $5 bottle mousepad still
want to be neat we will work on it once
it's getting colder again I put that on
hold because it turned into summer art
except 20 guys what temp is the most
important with Allen to pot temp or dye
temp and where is the pot and we're in
the pot is the temp the most accurate
for what you're trying to measure so
I'll let Joe take that as soon as he's
done I will come back to that one Roy
cause it's key 2.2 dollars loves the
roast of MTV funny as hell thank you
very much and then it burns when
Internet Protocol it burns when I pee
my gosh thank you are you going to have
an overclocking session for the razor
toaster if if I can I'll do it don't
forget your mic Joe there is a question
for you when you're ready here what was
again can you read it up again all right
exam $20.00 what temperature is the mo
there's two what temperature is the most
important Allen to the pot not for the
Dido well the dye temp is basically it
will stop reading it like minus 40 so
you really need the bottom so you want
to be concerned more with the pot tip at
that point and then this one the same
person and we're in the pot is the temp
the most accurate from what well it's
usually right behind the dye so like or
not right behind so you can figure
there's a little like I don't know if
it's a plate or we want to call it it's
drilling the right into right behind it
so it's pretty accurate I know on the
icon that you basically shove it through
and it's like right behind right in the
middle that yeah GPU yeah and I guess
let's talk about Delta temperature Delta
second tier regarding like how you can
kind of talk your paste is it going bad
I guess well usually like the minus 40
if this was to be any positive time
that would be a problem with base right
so like you see how it's minus 40 if I
were to run and they should we see that
go to minus 30 or whatever we know
there's a problem if I'm at minus 70 on
the actual thought attempt right so
see and that's like a bad match or bad
Alan - or something yeah it could be a
bunch of different things
scatter bencher 30 Taiwan dollars I work
so that Jo almost beats Lincoln PC
Congrats that was a while ago though I
saw that one was Johnny Olsen Norwegian
twenty skipped my super cats challenge
Steve I
I've been reading them all Johnny Olsen
oh no I read it but huh yeah that's the
one I read earlier and said no I'm not
gonna grow up beard free here sorry
come on wise door for advice store for
99 times thank you a fluffy $5 Gian
pants when no current plans GML into
pants that's all we need
Oh too bad we get a chin liquid-nitrogen
overclocking tracksuit summer you can
wear it to Vegas and I'll fit right in
didn't make that up
Yeah right in the casinos its bonus see
see if I thought as Joe knows how to
build suspense now we got that one pop G
funny it's a nice love the channel good
luck hope you break a record or - Thank
You Forrest boom $10 can the I got that
one to the mob Matt function as a good
mousepad like we said not advertised as
a mousepad can be used as one but it is
not a smooth service by design it's it's
a grippy surface so keep that in mind
you might want a mouse pad on top of it
I if minnow five dollars you guys
already ripped J single card score no
oops it fell out with that hey we should
save the spot anyway running wanna say
one I think I saved something you should
really be uploading it from your your
account though although I don't know if
that's possible if I'm like if I'm the
three mark license holder on that uh I
think if I save it I can still upload it
even my own hell it down to your own
yeah I could pull it up my own and do a
manual okay so that seemed to work to
get it back David Anderson 399 is Emma
side B 450 gave me Pro carbon okay for
mild OC build Zoid
in chat
they're actually hardcore overclock it
would be a good person to ask that
question I'd I am NOT I don't have like
all the specs memorize for the be 450
board sorry we do I'll say this we do
have a video from build Zoid on our
channel from around December I think
that was like best and the motherboard
your best AMD motherboards for
overclocking something like that so you
can check that video and see what he
lists in there and then those are the
good ones
a couple more here fan 2040 are - no I
think your hashtag Roman dunsky
sorry Roman Baths mascara 5 dollars on
the good hardware hat you should put the
beard portion of the logo on the grand
on a brim like so that's the front part
again yeah that's kind of weird now then
nobody would see it what's the point
Matthew I really am I getting trolled
pasture everything you want a mod Matt
but I'm waiting on the Paul's at full
review yes well tell him that we are
also waiting on the Serie history of you
Timothy reads to dies judge harshly
beard man thank you for the live or see
today's talking about your judging flow
see competition yeah it's my favorite I
love doing it to be honest he'll X Hound
X 13 299 what do you think respectively
refer aizen's we are not speculating on
them I can tell you one thing for
certain I know I confront this months
and months ago like a CES there will be
a 12 or there will be a 16 or we don't
know when they're coming out we don't
know if they're coming out at launch or
later and then there'll be an eight-core
I'm not going to speculate further than
that because those are the things I I
know to be true at least as of CES Scott
any $5 how do you know if there's any
BIOS not for the gigabyte a horas 1080i
mine is on and UK water cooling block
and I've got plus 80 megahertz plus 5 DN
I read I don't know if the top of my
head but Joe what's like a good for him
to check for a custom BIOS overclocked
mat or something yeah look like that and
I used to be pretty good
so maybe check overclock dotnet yeah see
if there's one on there I don't know
gigabyte allows it too much I mean it's
kind of I mean you got to be careful
trying to put another BIOS on your guard
4G yes cuz you I mean I've done it many
times
you got to know what you're doing a lot
of times you'll drop memory clocks and
they ain't got a mod memory or something
to build it up as possible if you end it
yeah it's possible to fry it too
yeah so you never know what it's gonna
do you gotta take it at your own risk
so let's talk about why you just
transferred from one of the smaller cans
doing it to another one the smaller can
because it basically builds so much
frost on the other one and it starts
getting cold so basically it's kind of
like how the when we use that thing it
just gets really cold at the top and
you'll get little burns and stuff if you
keep doing it right it also does start
turning into water too
yeah that's the other thing instead of
wiping it off I just switched out to
another one frozen let me do two more of
these before we get back into it well no
you're gonna have to take a score down
okay let's do that first
so we're taking a score down what's your
clock currently I get that plus 400
possible right still let me Emily do a
trick no it wasn't at 400 on that one
that was actually I think 375 got it
94 95 so that is a bit of an appoint
improvement 9188 and then finally got a
gt2 back nice a little bit so you're at
375 still and okay 375 will go 400 now
okay let me look at the rest of the
scores 94 mm 590 188 gt1 5808 that's a
big improvement 58 4.15 so again point
of reference we are now 10 FPS higher
almost exactly from our baseline run
with no overclock supplied just cold and
10 FPS and times by extreme is ole is a
lot of F yes oh yes that's a that's a
big score jump I just do the math on
that really quickly so in score number
91 88 versus the baseline of 75 75 sorry
75 77 21% total increase
and the memory increase is 22% pretty
damn big increase nothing wrong with
that huh
that's pretty damn good good job Joe I'm
glad I was here to supervise it so you
don't get hurt
prolong it we kept on that earlier yeah
I hope tens still mad about the fan
direction oh man
so builds wide said 210 tell Vince to
make a reaction video of watching the
stream yes please kingpin reaction video
should upload it to Archie
tell him time to do it and then send it
to us and we'll upload it and then it'll
get a lot of use Pro overclocker King
Penn reacts to chicken clucking chicken
clucking it's kind of funnier like
anytime I hear chicken clucking and when
tis went in actually says it is the way
he says it makes it that much better
yeah so you've been there yeah he has
that like the ten accent yeah it's so
much fun like it's so funny so every
time I hear that I always think of that
hey I'm saying it it's pretty funny
so he had a ten saying you know ten was
giving us crap waiting for twenty four
hundred megahertz now it's 2,500 now it
wants 2,500 yeah this is typical ten so
I usually bench with ten on the G scale
stay hot during the EVGA day and this is
pretty much what he does to me though
were you doing that last year I've seen
you on the side yeah okay oh that's like
four or five years yeah that's what I
was doing so I don't think Vince was
Benton he was doing the robot was that
row o'clock yeah yeah so he was doing
the Robo clocker and then I was doing
all the manual fucking yeah Robo Cocker
I guess if you haven't seen our video on
that just take it take a note to watch
it later or something cuz we did a video
with Vince last year yeah you'll see me
in the background like yeah doing a
bunch of stuff you see the beard
and that's when Vince was I don't
remember what he was at seven point
something gigahertz maybe no no no
because he said it was a wasn't it
I was just sitting on 88 Oh was it yeah
it's underrated even a single card I
think it was it okay I can be I think
they here is an axis can I'm pretty sure
was a Titan be on the dark hey I think
you're right on Titan the I didn't
remember what the CP was oh you're right
5.7 okay yeah some reason I thought was
a lower core cop CP you know it was a
5.7 which on an 18 core was he's damn
good
yeah that's pretty up there and that was
with the Titan because I think it says
back 79 have a cold bug shouldn't some
chips do 10 have mercy I have to do work
tomorrow parentheses today can't record
eight hours of Vince's reaction why not
well Joe's gonna have a plane to get on
at some point today so yeah won't be
that long we still got some time though
sandy E has a cold bug at minus eighty
to minus twenty depending on the CPU
builds oh it says okay what other we've
got a couple store orders thank you for
setting those in so we got one from
Jonathan in Virginia not too far from
here picks up the mousepad
and the blueprint shirts
thank you for picking that up we got one
big order from Ryanair from the
Netherlands thank you for picking up the
mousepad the anniversary logo shirt the
chalkboard shirt and then the blueprint
shirt much appreciated that's a big
support for the stream thank you very
much live stream Vince's reaction
already first score yes what is the
score
I'm waiting for - haha they have plus
400 now yeah I think it's 400 and that's
1695 51 that is an improvement from 94
95 earlier when here's make sure that
knee to 50/50 8.3 if it's four times six
seven mmm
everything is up it's pretty good
improvement
yeah is there like a cheap Alan to pot
you know is there like a like kind of a
no-name knockoff one or something and
looked round on Aliexpress GPU bar and
finally or CPU just thinking like the
problem if you want to get into Ellen to
dirt cheap I guess
no check eBay for used ones yeah to be
honest your best just like trying to
find like old ones like maybe like a
venom the kingpin venom that was a good
pot that's probably cheap if we can find
it like secondhand I wouldn't really try
to do a cheap bottom no coolants made
when it was epic fail mm-hmm
it was really bad the ek1 is kind of not
relevant anymore I mean in it doesn't
fit any family
yeah you won't have any mounts the
mounts because it's very like you need
to buy modules for it and yeah so it's
kind of pointless yeah basically just
look for maybe some old kingpin ones or
maybe devourer had a older one before
the before the beast I before there's a
beast and there was another one I can't
remember their Romans in chat he can you
can let us know what is old or maybe
just look for used ones it's probably
the better bit or if you're on a budget
right so what I mean the kitchen ones
aren't really that so it says what about
the GN Cockrum oh you know that's a good
point
hardware numbers will give him a big
shout out hardware numbers has a I think
they currently in Cinebench score for
AMD 2200 X and thanks chip man hey yeah
ours and also I would 10 says we had the
iron iron Ellen teapot also hardware
numbers has a video I away I'm gonna see
what happened he has a video where he
took our copper mule mug and so we
filled these with Allen C Joe and I last
he took our car from you like which is
actual copper it's not like the
stainless steel that's just painted so
it's actual car it's got nickel plated
lining not currently on the store sorry
where we don't have an immediate restock
date at this time but um took this
mounted it to the I think it was like a
rise in APU or something and filled it
with that one too and it did really well
I was surprised yeah I probably wouldn't
ride it on a big trip though no yeah
there's a reason there's an apiary yeah
like that's the thing you use with those
is mounting pressure contact oh yeah
it's not built
yeah there's no surface area buffer I
guess you can say alright but for a low
TDP it was okay as a joke video you
should watch this video that hardware
numbers for that one yeah do it again
try any DEP
heat it up yeah we turn this off so Joe
is going to torch the pot we're at minus
105 right now and I think are you
bringing it down to minus 50 so bring it
down to minus 50 and this will help him
through some of the stability in a bit
yeah really I should just break it down
I think it happened again so yes it does
Mike mics off but he said if it happens
again then we'll break down the pot and
fix it up and then keep going after that
ten minutes to do so that's not bad but
right now we're just torching it and
then we will we will keep going after
that all right next one so we got some
super chance to do it while Joe's
torching the ellentube pot over there
Martin Darlington $5 thank you Scott
adventure is Joey using an open bench
table as his benching platform I catch
that on your behalf I use foam so Joe
uses foam we actually showed it that
open bench table yeah
Thor right 199 will the order I placed
last night be signed if it was during
the stream yes but we weren't saying we
were signing stuff after the stream
because the problem is I don't I don't
want to like ship out of mouse pad
someone bought after the stream and then
they get it and it's signed and they
like what is why are you giving me this
why should I sign this uh-huh I don't
know who these people are I'll talk when
our distributor team is back in town on
Friday I'll I'll talk to them and see
how many orders there were between the
streams if it's not too many and we have
the inventory it seems like they were
intended like people wanted them to be
signed then we can do it but I also
don't want to ship a bunch of signed
mousepads people who didn't like so
typically I cut it off after the stream
because if someone waits through the
streams they're like I want to buy one
because it looks cool but I don't want
it to be signed then I don't want to
send them aside one so but you know what
Thor right if you send an email to
support at gamers Nexus net
that will help us if you want it to be
assigned one just say like hey I bought
it between the two streams
I just wanted to specify that I would
like one of the signed ones if they are
still available and then we'll send one
to you if we still have them wish we
should I think as of right now we should
be good but just on that email all right
next one admire Fiesta Guild $10 can we
have a live rise in 3000 over-talking
event for the same hour the NDA runs out
we have done things like that for
previous releases so I'll probably try
for that we'll have a review up the same
hour that the NDA runs out we're not I'm
not under an NDA for right now and then
we'll do a stream probably later in that
day that's typically what we do is we
give the review like six hour buffer
that people can watch it then we'll do
stream DJ ghost proxy we go ghost proxy
five dollars building them my first VR
PC any recommendations for good LGA 1151
air cooler that will be sitting on an i5
and i7 the Anaka and hu 14s is pretty
good Gator roll tonight why I installed
Windows 10 fresh install had windows 7
my CPU and GPU used 100% when any single
game is running now and 170 is 35% max
on the advise CPU and GPU 100% it sounds
like it's background task or something
it's eating cycles that's not know at
all make sure your drivers are all
installed properly
Gabriel see you in two dollars the t-rex
should fit on the 2990 WX to do that we
will consider thread refer overclocking
at some point how's this going good is
back again but Ivan I don't know how gt2
will go you turn your mic back on is it
on yeah okay so that's just for people
who are tuning and more recently let's
explain why you torch the pot I guess
and well it just stops running so it
seems when I go back down to minus 50 I
don't know if it's the paste or if it's
the memory that gets too cold after a
period of time I mean we've been running
a while usually I go to these clocks
right away so that way it's running it
keeps it hot and
doesn't go but it's kind of boring on a
live stream right we're trying to make
it more intrigue a I'm gonna have to
just drop him okay yeah question and
chat will you accept debit cards in the
future we already do on the story he's
just a type it in it should work fine
yeah I'm gonna have to torch it all the
way so what voltage are you at 4 1 3 1 3
oh yeah oh I know this runs this way
yeah
you meet it already yeah all right so I
will fill some vias for Joe a while he's
doing that actually let me take one of
the super chats before I go do that so
that hot pan on the rad is annoying me
yes sorry I just threw whatever on there
so we got one yeah I got one from
Frankie tricky one dolly Thank You
Gabriel seaman $10 29.92 WX onto
livestream with the leftover while Joe's
gonna be taking this t-rex pot back with
them at night fire 37 $5 tech Jesus best
Jesus Camaro 4.99 love the channel keep
up the good work thank you very much I
just sub the bearded hardware as well
awesome thank you bps customs sign I owe
you $5.00 I'm frustrated that Steve has
better hair than me and Joe crushes my
beard game might drive down there to
cause a ruckus yes we want to I've been
talking with Brian from BBS customs
because he has far more patience and
ability than I do
for building nice-looking systems so
after Computex sometime indeterminate
period where we're gonna try and work
together and have Brian do a like a
pretty nice system build in our case
labs case that we have like maybe maybe
open-loop set up and then we'll have do
like 79 and at least one video card in
there so that'll be pretty fun but no no
current date on that yet although if you
don't know BPS customs he's on youtube
as well and i saw him during the China
trip that Andrew and I did recently
so I'm just spilling liquid nitrogen for
Joe right now and that noise you hear at
the end of the pore is because it's
starting to hit the floor evaporates
immediately so most of you in the stream
have seen this at this point but in case
anyone's just tuning in Ellen - and this
and these containers are used to fill
this one Joe dumps it in - Alan - pot
it's a bit noisy right now because he's
torching the pot give us a minute the
noise will go down and if you missed it
earlier and yesterday stream and let's
do a shot of this again
so let's target right here so just
because it looks pretty cool this is
what happens with Alan - when it touches
basically any surface
it's just instantly evaporate it's
pretty cool so just nitrogen you do have
to be a little careful with this stuff
if you're in a closed space for example
then it's it'll start of placing the
oxygen in the room so if you ever work
with this be very aware of your
ventilation we're in a really big room
with AC and use the torch if it doesn't
light there's no oxygen yeah waiting
that's a key indicator so those are the
safety measures and then it if you're
curious it doesn't really doesn't really
burn like stain a little tiny bit but
just don't let it soak we talked about
all that already but just in case anyone
is getting ideas and wants to do this
stuff how's that going good I just got
to blow it up and Myka's on yeah that's
right you're good at this man getting
you could get in the hand of the
microphone management I'm learning no
thanks to you do you want to walk them
through what you're doing while I fill
this yeah what I'm gonna do is basically
heat it up basically the cards wet so
they stop function and sometimes so we
need to basically heat it up and get it
back to normal so it's dry so I'm gonna
go and use a hairdryer so it's really
loud so I'm gonna go in the other room
and turn
mic and I'll be back in a couple minutes
boy you're gonna use the yeah
the one we discovered the amazing one so
not the not the heat gun right the
actual hand dryer so sometimes people
ask about how things have changed since
we've gotten an office and I wanna this
is the best way so Joe discovered while
here that the you know I can in an
office bathroom where you have or any
industrial bathroom you have like the
wall-mounted hand dryer he has
discovered that that is the absolutely
most amazing way to dry out components
because he goes out there dries it out
in the hand dryer and then it's like
it's completely dry and good to go again
for overclock you know I'm not under a
minute and it's pretty amazing so Joe
will be right back he is drying that off
oh yeah good point someone says time to
plug in a power meter I'll wait for him
to come back and make sure in chat you
remind me before he turns it on a plugin
actually unplug the power splice of that
we have something to remind us to plug
in a power meter very good point
so we'll just monitor the GPU I'll
probably do it on a kilowatt to keep it
easy so it was 10 says if it's possible
it would be cool to show folks how the
KPE card is prepped
let's do that one Joe's back well I'm
because it's not mounted now we can just
kind of show it off on a table and show
you what it what it looks like for the
prep where's the Vaseline there's a lot
of it on there all right super chats so
we have Paul the bearded one five
dollars got on the stream late today
guys wondered if you would advise the
kingpin card even if I'm not considering
using Allen - so you know being fully
honest here it is not a card you should
buy for just like normal use because it
is really expensive I know that EVGA
probably doesn't disagree with me on
this you know it's it's not built for
just like plug it in and let it go you
can do that and it is technically higher
frequency I think we were running out
like 20 40 megahertz which is typically
what and over
clocked 20 ATT I have another model run
just out of the box so like it is faster
it's just frankly it's it's not worth
the performance increase if you're just
gonna use it like that so if you're
using it like we are today then it's
it's worth it cuz man it goes it's pre
prepped for you you don't have to do any
hard mods that's the real value of
something like a KP card is it's all
done for you so all you have to do is
get like back so see BIOS and start
playing around with it or you know if
you don't use that so even if you're not
doing L on to and you're gonna do
overclocking with the stock liquid
cooler I found that to be pretty fun as
well just be aware that until you put
the XYZ BIOS on there you'll become
power limited so you do have to be
willing to do a little bit amount of
have to be willing to do a little bit
amount of work of a like flash the BIOS
and you know do some real overclocking
on it if you just want like the best
which some people do then I guess you
can buy it the values not there for that
use case but the value is there for what
we're doing today or even one step down
you do like water cooling overclocking
and I will give you full details on all
that in our more official review after I
finish the rest of the testing but I
will say stock the performance numbers
and games like sniper or far cry 5 or
whatever we're typically higher equal to
fully overclocked 20 atti of like a
reference or like an ACCI ultra even
designed so like it is better it's just
you know you have to weigh the value
depending on what your use cases Shh
who's next my cloud or $2.00 your gt2 is
52-27 when it was 55:27
okay we will check that whenever we get
to it scatter bench though we actually
saw that earlier it's got about your
Taiwan $30.00 it's not reading super
chat hashtag tech to this add SEK 50 how
about merge with chicken o'clock or on
it well we'll get 10 involved in license
it from Steam fryer $1.00 Thank You
moose six six six seven $1.99 free super
giant take my money thank you very much
and I'm just gonna run through these
while Joe is finishing off drying that
that card out a quick note we do run
like a thirty to one hour 30 minutes one
hour delay on the Super chats but I'm
only 30 minutes behind right now
so marina lines from 2:30 which is
actual
that Steve fryer $1 thank you Peter
Trender $2 for you super chat thank you
that is really cool that YouTube does
that again wasn't where until recently
Christian $2 watching this from work
hashtag kingpin o P Joe Ritchie oniy one
died lollipop dancer 199 I'd buy it for
a G on chicken o'clock or t-shirt Hector
X 1 dollar 1 X $1 Davio's stai nursin
SEK $10 thank you no messages on those
hugh janus $2 thank you Andrew a rough
roof car $5 notice 3dmark is out of date
is there an advantage to keeping it up
to date you might get some of them the
like updated system info maybe some new
benchmarks like Port Royal I don't think
is on e right now and then for
validation purposes sometimes it is
important as well that was chat going
while we're waiting on Joe what's chat
saying just talking about your own
overclocks it looks like so let's see I
have no nice paul the be everyone says
thanks very much steve told me
everything I wanted to know I think I
might bite for it so it looks like Paul
the buter one might be buying a
kindergarten so Joe when you're back
over here I have two things we got to do
one is we should show the KP card in its
current state before plugging it back in
to walk through how you have crapped it
sure 10 ones I have that I have to prep
it Oh a bit more anyway okay cool and
then the other one is I unplugged the
power supply and I'm gonna go grab a
young unmute your mic sound meter now
good evening yeah I'm gonna go grab a
just a kilowatt meter yeah yeah this is
the time to do it go in there and
entertain a chat for me I guess I'll
show off what you're doing all right let
me move some stuff around so you can see
it now all right
so I just blew it all off is that
something really bad yeah of course it
is saying thanks you want to work on
that frame the card was soaked I mean
usually I just bench right away at minus
100 and then go right to about I think
25 50 25 60
but that's not fun to show on the stream
all right so you can see how it's
prepped now it's just basically a lot of
Vaseline all the Vaseline is kind of
leaked off from the heat from the
blow-dryer so add it back I'm gonna plug
in the just a kilowatt meter here yeah
just uh on a thing and then we'll keep
track of it when we're running not gonna
fast this thing up pretty well all the
Vasque pretty much came off so we need
to lube it up real good and I'm just
coming up with all sorts of good ones
right now I bet you the chats blowing up
you know there's nothing weird about
going to Walgreens buy buy a big tube of
Vaseline buy three cans of Red Bull and
a soup of a tub of Vaseline wow that
just really does sound awkward doing
that just looks like we were buying the
red bowl to cover up for the Vaseline
yeah oh this is a completely normal
purchase it's nothing weird here you
mean you don't leave that all the time
not too frequently only when you're here
oh it's kind of true though like staffs
everywhere so this thing is coated yeah
it's definitely coated multiple times
haha
John Norris in the normal chat can we
get a it's done ski for all times hey
hey yeah done skiing ski season right so
that's the back part I also want to get
under where the memory modules are
enough you can see in here underneath
here every bunch of paper towels but
obviously it will leak out after a while
so I need to lose that up real good yes
we got memory down there yeah I think
those are probably the memory modules
that go and you probably ask 10 cuz he's
probably in all scientific on it but is
there anything that you avoid getting it
on pins I guess PCIe pins well when you
put the face down I don't want it on the
I mean you say he doesn't to be honest
most people say that's a problem but I
haven't really seen that much of a
problem with Vaseline here you
definitely don't want it in obviously uh
to get in where the GPU is but we're
already mounted so yeah I mean it's
gonna eventually go in there anyway I
mean behind the VGA but I don't think it
really causes any issue
I mean if Vince uses Vaseline all the
time so there's not really that much of
an issue between that someone says what
has GPU teardown item number 11 on your
media mod net let me see which one is
number 11 ain't on one second I'll
answer your question that bass yeah is
it exactly the same I don't know if we
changed anything I was just gonna show
no it didn't today so there's a new
medium I gotta put everything back
brand-new
what has item number 11 what GPU Oh 11
is just an electrolytic capacitor so
basically everything let me show we've
got a lot of stuff on the table so here
is you see that okay Andrew here's the
mod Matt yeah sir item 11 and you did
that that design that graphic for the
the video card the PCB you can buy this
on store that gamers Nexus done that
they are in stock item 11 is just some
caps like the big fat cylindrical kept
capacitors and those Ron Allah
everything
so I think we kind of loosely modeled
after like the larger costume PCBs and a
lot of the time you'll see those over
there I guess I can hold this up later
okay to roll it up right now all right
so we're almost there I just got to plug
in the power you did the kilowatt meter
on it what's that did you do something
finally now you're all good over there
yeah I just got a plug in on the power
it's kind of a pain in make sure you but
all that from the right power supply
though yeah I know I know that yesterday
I was real nervous about it 10:10 says
you're missing the strategic screw on
memory chip to improve memory clocked by
plus 50 megahertz memory screw yeah like
the one that ten installs on us don't
have and if anyone's missing that joke
check out our cane pin card 20 atti
teardown it was done an EVGA Zach's OC
lab and I opened it up I was like
there's just screw it here and then then
started giving 10 a hard time for yes I
played about hey well Tendo is slacking
yeah well I just like that they they
both say that they fixed the other
person's stuff oh yeah when you hang out
with them it's quite a quite interesting
yeah if they're fun yeah they act like
an old married couple
just saying so that's not inaccurate
someone says um what is the max temp of
the Vaseline I guess is the question max
time I don't know that there's really I
don't really know I mean I guess it can
freeze but right it's the revolt point
if we're having the Vaseline is to
basically have a barrier layer from
having water go on to everything right
but the problem is is it also kind of
leaks off to if it's hot so by heating
up the pot you kind of drain off it it
drained it off on certain components so
you're gonna have to reapply right right
and then when I heat it up and dry it
off I also kind of blow off the Vaseline
so you gotta reapply so you need to use
the heat gun on that to heat it up at
all or like reflow the vas you
just gonna let it run no I was gonna let
it run okay yeah up the pot heat it up
to about minus or plus 35 so the heat
from that and it just flow it back so
nice and Plus kind of movie in a hurry
get back on it power readings enabled
yes thank you chat I did plug in a power
meter thank you for putting that out we
we plugged one end I'll be able to read
the power during this next one it's rude
alright so thank you for reminding me
that it's sneak in here so you are
preparing to boot I guess yeah nice all
ready to go good I hear that veer out
there yeah it's the V arm Finn's going
against the paper towel just taking it
you know making sure we keep track of
the good Matt inventory
all right cool
so then we're back and your back nice
power meter power meter power meter I
got it guys good kid hey Steve D do you
have the power meter sorry and just
short of that Steve where's the power
meter Dave Caillou
cats your ninja loved reading that name
327 here is my survey money thank you
Kenneth 7 365 love you guys have a great
stream thank you very much we are to
Florida I earn five dollars I have an
old 560 TI I believe it is that I have
no more use for it I send it to you to
do whatever you want with it
we have actually two 562 guys from
reader already that we're working with I
don't know promises that will put it to
use if you're like trying to get rid of
it anyway and you don't want to put into
electronics recycling then we have a P o
box listed in our what was that video uh
which video are you talking about Steve
yeah we did a video recently on the
readers components they sent in thought
it was pure box on channel you can
search for it but no guarantee we'll
work with it let's see
Stephen Kyle Bert's
$5 loving accountant keep it up thank
you how's that going good just pulling
down again so I basically took a blow
dryer and totally got any water that was
on it even inside the pot because that
would also affect how we clock this time
our deltas are pretty nice right now we
got oh yeah anywhere between three or
four degrees you go so it's like a
timing yeah it's definitely delayed yes
software so we read in like four degrees
software and about zero on the reader
the meter yeah and we're gonna lose the
software soon once it gets too cold yeah
it's kind of normal but yeah a good
indication like if you lose like any
type of pace right the temperature you
can he do that
two dollars difference is between a 20
80 TI and RDX Titan on Allen's here well
I mean if everything else is equal then
the Titan RDX should I perform it if
there are a hundred percent equal yeah
but sometimes the memory is of
limitation so if you have a lot more
memory it's more stressful on the GPU
that's true so that it's not always
necessarily true
yeah because usually the Ti is always a
cut down version right yeah well I can
tell you from for chilled water with
like an on XOC card the Titan RT X does
our perform it yeah that but once you
get intel on - especially if you're
working with like a KP card then yeah
there's no competition this I don't even
keep up because there's so much you have
to do that tie in yeah I mean if you
maybe took a Titan and put it on the KP
PCB right yeah if you like power
modeling yes and maybe yeah yeah but
even the power mod it's the piece the
PCB design on the Cape is what makes it
special right it's not just it's all the
components used it's also then trying to
they're giving you an Ellen to
overclocking card right off the bat so
you don't have to do all the major
things to try to come back and you used
to do that stuff yeah I used to do it
before Pascal well I did I did a Pascal
card to keep our it right yeah it's just
a pain it's not the same as what is a
people talk about a zombie I'd put it in
there basically it's cutting power to
like the GPU
and putting your own card on there so
that way you can control everything that
goes to the GPU the problem with it now
is it it's very complicated because
Nvidia locks it down so much
so before Pascal they didn't lock it
down as much right so now they do so
they make it much more difficult so I
kind of got out of that zone of doing
that right yeah well you're fighting a
losing battle yeah
so it came down to it and I you know
what I had a lot of fun doing that - it
was kind of my what I used to do all the
time yeah so see see five dollars I
wonder if torching helps learn the Delta
between the inside surface of the pot
and the bottom so the L&amp;amp;T vaps quicker
clean quicker that's kind of I think the
answer is yes good but you don't want to
do it too much because then you do if
you do too much water then you're kind
of creating in an adverse effect whereas
the water then turns into ice and then
it becomes a barrier between the ln2 and
the actual pot itself a little bit is
good so that way basically I don't know
it's like soups up the pot to be able to
suck the other right so Matt Hill one
dollar
heck tricks one dollar thank you okay
I'm gonna turn off again a good torture
rule okay Brubaker ten dollars will you
be reviewing the Gigabyte a horas
monitor that you're using on the stream
but looking at buying it but waiting on
a good amount of reviews on it before
pulling the trigger on it we don't
presently review monitors - no
unfortunately I won't be reviewing it
I sort of know how to do the the monitor
visa if we ever had the manpower what we
just don't right now
Jimmy cakes one dollar and then again
thank you like 44 hair beard and Allen -
what else to do
Anthony Jackson two dollars best 4-h
ativ - in Corsair 760 t rear or bottom I
would do rear with that minimal amount
of information if you know if I guys you
guys just beat kingpins and herb our
single cards for really well we're not
done yet
I don't know how much Vince does TSE no
I don't think eight benches at all he
does a lot of Port Royal these days so
but we'll take it though
Raoh lose fifteen
1600 yeah we're gonna go pretty much
right up we're really about 450
yesterday yesterday work today today we
left off at 400 and yesterday 450 yeah
we'll do for 50 years or 50 yeah going
for a bigger overclocking well the trick
is the card is not dry so it's actually
better to do it now to do it now right
off the bat
we'll get this running much much quicker
your voltages 1.34 NBA and 1.5 for FP v
GD yep so you have GPU volts and then
memory Vox 1.13 thumb is moving its 1.11
3 yes one point one three heads there so
at minus 15
I have written down one point one three
that maybe was one one three was it one
one two yeah it's one one three okay
yeah well we know what our load mine was
messed up from last time load line
should be level zero no it's actually
should be ten now zero is the flat load
line now it's the opportunity I don't
think so I'm pretty sure it was it I'm
pretty sure it's level zero who I was
running in level 10 yesterday's no okay
someone told me that I didn't actually
verify it sure tins gonna verify it in
chat I'm sure how soon is that the late
catches up oh yeah without a doubt
I'm pretty sure it should be zero if
you're at ten yesterday then you can
probably drop here voltage a bit let's
see what more usually depends on the GPU
I've seen some where I had the opposite
where I wanted to flow up hmm like that
and it would actually give me because I
could only set a certain amount of
voltage so I needed of changing the load
line so it would go up so the initial
set would go and write a so but that was
the back of the 1980 DS Ryanair over to
looking forward to the mousepad three
shirts and the fan through static wrist
strap well thank you for purchasing them
Gary T just bought a GN mousepad a co-op
blue beer glass and a medium crystal
statute awesome thank you for the
support awesome it's ten answer now ten
says vote for 2500 chicken o'clock - 100
C 1 point 4 volts
you don't even need I don't notice I
keep fighting them yeah this is what I
do at a copy takes oh well 10 will give
you a massive troop so I think level
zero is what we want yeah but I was
running it last time yeah so I want to
just make sure okay if I know
something's running then I'm gonna keep
it the same
it was just weird because it's at the
level zero by itself last time all right
yeah while it's yeah the defaults
doesn't seem to affect the load line
when you click default it just leaves it
wherever it was which is tins fault it's
always gentle okay so just one hundred
there hey so how how store doing lots
orders on the store thank you I shot a
few out can't get them all due to the
volume but Igor from Springfield picks
up a mob bat thank you and an extra
wrist strap well definitely enjoy the
mod Matt my favorite thing to do is
still that's you how to do a video in
the pool we should do the hotel yeah
that would have been amazing
bands from ever returning probably right
I'm gonna thought these no tanners for
Joe cuz I just wanted the mop that I did
there you go
fresh out of the pressure yeah me
refresh see that's fine yeah I'm on any
date out three what are you doing over
there
I'm just going for a bigger run you
going for twenty five hundred you pass
twenty five hundred megahertz I I just
went right for 450 450 offset yeah
memory 1600 yeah it's not like enough
let's change the load line
I could have sworn it with that ten
yesterday but I think I was at zero I
saw that time I just wonder it was it if
it did that by mistake when I do it yeah
sure cuz I never I never came I might
have changed it I don't know if you
weren't looking could have been alright
I gotta fill this maybe that's what it
is you change it on me
I think a lot of us if I saw a little
town I'd probably change it to zero yeah
it's probably what it is them just to be
honest was bitching awhile for it a
while with it so this will be the first
time we're doing this today I'm just
gonna fill the Dewar out we have a 180
I'll take some super shots in a moment
to decision desert Brno shout out for
buying a mat feels bad man and there's
your shoutout thank you for buying one
like there's a lot of volume so doing my
best to keep up super chance I'll do all
of them at least adds up now by the end
of the stream but no I got it
something's wrong up having trouble with
stability yeah it's not running he's
gonna reboot well you got time I'll fill
this and yeah show it off to stream so
for those of you who weren't tuned in
yesterday
there's a transfer hose these cost
upwards of $400 depend on length of the
transfer hose and this is an Allen to
cylinder 180 liters it is mostly empty
if not fully empty not still leaking so
and then we have another one behind me
that is completely full and I guess I'll
have to try and find something to do
with this in the next week before we
leave for Computex because otherwise
there's no point happy that so that
one's still fall the trick here is to so
doers mostly empty got a hold onto the
transfer hose it's gonna start with like
an alien noise has chat said yesterday
sorry and you hold the hose at first in
pieces like a pressure kickback so
there's a mackey interface yeah so
doesn't smack in the face and which i've
almost a devon and i'm this joe i think
the tank will start making a squealing
noise when it's empty
yeah will be like a really nasty wine
yeah so we're not empty yet and that's
the ln2 filling up so that's the gas
that comes off of it it's a liquid going
into it and
I can show you some temperatures too
this is just a thermocouple reader we
use here the room temperature is
currently 22 degrees for what it's worth
humidity is 46% and then the just like
that started to off-gassing right here
let's get really close to it let's get
like let's get right there it's right at
the top of the cap so the thermocouple
you have a good shot of that and here
thermocouple is currently - 179 degrees
Celsius which is just about where Alan -
is minus 196 it's probably it doesn't
read that look I think it while I love
them thermal discipler though this
should have a range of minus 200 I think
some of them say they do but they really
don't kind of well I just I don't know
it is nearly touching the middle of the
transfer hose and in the container so
it'll be close to those temperatures
let's get it on the transfer hose little
bug out of some point what's going on
yeah we're at minus 7 170 up here and
then just like right here is pretty cold
I mean you would you wouldn't feel too
good holding there forever so that's
minus zero oh now it's bugging out
because that end of it frosted over
since it's but now it's gonna be it was
going between yeah like zero and a
hundred and minus 100 because then froze
over we lost accuracy there it's
definitely cold it's called there's the
coulomb and tendrils we get I had to
tighten this yesterday because I
realized last night that it was like him
it was leaking yeah but yeah you don't
want to touch this when it's on it at
all it's cold and it will burn you
yeah it's like licking a frozen like
telephone pole or something
not a good idea still got some left kick
it up a little bit
just filling the Dewar with liquid
nitrogen
Joe what's it look like for you know
it's running now 400 400 is like it
didn't like the logo in it okay where I
didn t really what do you have it at
then Wow okay what's V for about 1 3
we're not beaker but you know what I
mean I don't know I think it may be the
paste is done because remember yesterday
I
to be peg fitted and we're running
basically almost 2200 right over that
yeah so not having that same luck on
this it's such a Hot Chip and like I
mean if you look at the diet kind of
ridiculous
yeah it is a large sigh on outside
temperature and it beats up the pace you
got to figure out how hot it's going
then these type of clocks because we're
I think we're at about 2,500 a yeah what
are the asked about a big tank
where's yeah I think question is that
the one big tank yes that's the first
one so I'm gonna torch it mark them
Haven you'd like
think we're gettin approaching empty on
this one I hear you hear that rattling
you're my exhaust Joe says I'm telling
you that tanks broken
sorry we're doing a lot of things with a
lot of noise right now I'm gonna step
over here so Joe is torching the pot and
then I'm pulling an Allen to a doer
thirty liter doer with liquid nitrogen
the noise will go down momentarily but
that does take a little bit to fill the
check chat
let's see if they make it cooler the air
will freeze someone says yes there are
special gloves made for Allen - we do
have them actually there's one right
there on the table but we don't use them
because it makes it hard to handle the
the containers and it's just frankly not
really necessary questions okay cool I'm
back yeah someone says greetings from
German Germany what there'll be Suu is
we are using the kpx nice today Nia sir
blue throne paste he sells it on Kingdom
cooling yeah it's fairly new to you just
picked this up water a couple a couple
weeks ago when you're in Taiwan yeah
yeah aap paste is pretty new did they
didn't bother you over it like when you
were checking in with paste cuz I've
heard that and do that I remember he
sent me some and like customs kind of
freaked out
no but one time I did have I did have
its own from ASA tech bring us like
probably 2 pounds if they're all based
oh yeah and he he carried it on and it
was from China and not to China at the
airport in China they yeah they took
they took some of it they took a lighter
and they tried to light it even to
explode which seems like a kind of
dangerous way to say let's test it like
right in front of us to see if it
explodes yeah it's like a that doesn't
sound like a really good idea freaking
stuff over there trying to make sure it
wasn't a plastic explosive yeah but just
they're all placed in front of you yeah
although they would have blown up and
yes not a funny but not I should I -
yeah all right
now if this doesn't work don't get just
break it down and we paste it ok
fen check 87 is the sine pod not really
$20 purchased FYI well thank you for
purchasing it yes it is because I have
to drive a combined one hour to and from
where they distribute prom and then we
have to go through and sign them all but
it does it is a big support obviously
Paul Ripper $2
what is the oldest in teller MVC view
that you have overclocked Joe dole this
one yeah or maybe the first one here
like the P fours actually no I that fits
like it back in uh you wouldn't the
wetback 286 is where you can do like the
jumper overclocked 286s oh yeah those
were like the first computer
yeah the pace is done nice I'm gonna
have to break it down again okay yeah I
just got a redo paste we did paste it's
kind of at that point where it's not
coming back and I know what this card
runs it so alright alright so we're pull
up onto over here
laughs lean on the sides yeah
Axios gave me an order number and said
signs please we don't have a way to just
like sign by request or personalized so
if it's a mod mat and you paid for the
signed one it will be signed if it's a
mousepad
bought during the stream it will be
signed so you not have to worry about
that if it's like a shirt or something
that we don't do that
have you thought about doing phase
change cooling I have thought about it I
have done chilled school and I'd like to
do more of that
but one I swear almost at the bottom
here of these super chats but now it
happens on phase change let me catch up
on the super chance we're almost at the
very bottom of these it burns when
Internet Protocol burns when I pee
question any for question for you or Joe
and he plans to give a tutorial on
stripping Windows 10 for better scores
but that'd be better for you to do than
me so yeah so Joe might do that on
bearded hardware on youtube if you check
him out subscribe to his links below
Sam tqc 1 2 3 $2 free money for you
let's go thank you
Mary is hagglunds and a Norwegian 22 you
guys look like a sleep cover fans great
work oh I'll take it I've also gotten
Eddie Vedder I've gotten that one too
you mat are $1.00 matter are $1 again
thank you Daniel Bachmann $2 is long
hair and a beard is long hair and a
beard required for extreme overclocking
no Joe says now
it's very that's very inclusive of you
Joe - to not have a trying to play nice
not pull the ladder up after you ha ha
Joshua Bell $5 my reference IAT IMAX is
out at 56 degrees south and sorry about
the noise guys he'll stop soon yeah okay
14:58 megahertz core anyways get a
little further on air 980ti isn't as
temperature sensitive as pascal and
taurine so that's not gonna help as it
will help but not as much maybe a custom
bios if you can find one that has a
higher power target or something like
that Johnny D 499 GM Store donation on
its way thank you happy to support the
efforts of Captain overclocked keep it
follows more content thank you very much
llama PA welcome Hill and ten
can you put Titan r-tx GPUs on this PCB
like desolder and recent I mean if you
got some crazy VGA skills probably but I
don't think the PCB would handle it like
you'd have to have some custom BIOS
yeah the video locks down the bias so
much that I mean wouldn't be trivial
guys like tin and kink and Kington could
probably definitely do it right
Steven Len $2.00 can you make a video on
loop order with two radiators so might
want to get this - cuz I'm gonna take it
all apart
cool so let's get close I know what the
card runs and it's not running it so
that time it that means paste is done
what's your your goal today for
frequency uh 2600 M I mean we're at
yesterday we ran almost 2,600 no problem
yeah we're close I did it before and
then I shut down the system so that what
we were prepped for it right but
obviously we sat there for a long time
chicken clucking yeah and that's really
never good you should really kind of go
to the clocks last clocks you were to
really get a score cuz the car gets cold
when you're not running and that's it
just typically how they go yeah so the
again for point of reference
2,600 megahertz that doesn't necessarily
mean a lot to you
the overclocked 28 et eyes like the XE
ultra or the raft
designed they typically fall in the
range of 20 50 maybe 21 15 megahertz max
so 2600 is is massive probably most so
how do you feel about the paste this is
good but for summer I you could tell
it's very hard cuz look how big that
Dyess it's monstrous I mean it did if
you look I like the older cars they were
like so tiny
alright so I it's probably just needs to
be reapplied so I know I did it
yesterday and as soon as I reapplied it
I was like BAM back to 2600 again or
almost 2,600 we got a message from jacob
at EVGA saying how's it going good
can't complain well Jacob I'm not gonna
reply to your text hopefully you're
watching the stream there's your answer
should be watching the stream right let
me read these last few super chats it's
always nice to get caught up on those
reading we don't have too many here I
need to steal these for me do it they
should spray can you make a video on
loop order oh I was gonna answer that so
loop order um yeah if if you're doing
like GPU overclocking I would say hit
the GPU first it's gonna be a lot more
thermally sensitive than a CPU CPU if
it's not like 90 Plus then it really
doesn't doesn't behave too differently
under a normal overclocking like non
extreme scenario so I'd say hit the GPU
FERS to take advantage of the thermal
dependence on dependency by the clock
and get a boost there ex devs combo this
was really here thirty thousand dollars
vote for 2500 chicken o'clock - my heart
to you I'm fighting for votes yeah I
would actually do it 1.3 yesterday so
1.4 I probably should go at 1.4 after
we're done when I get that yeah
gathering pace today IRA piston do we
have enough kpx
yeah yeah the big tub is plenty so how's
the buy more phone yeah you know these
pace guys man I'm doing the wrong
business I need to get into pace
business yeah for real cuz like well
that's what that's what you do and
you're a retired overclocker oh that's
true you can't bench anymore yeah you're
getting too old your knees don't really
hold up and
or devourer he's old quarterback you
just start making paste instead I know
I'm gonna have them thermal grizzly and
kpx both available
the funny part would be just the name I
think we were talking about that a
little bit yours
leprechaun the leprechaun or something
yeah
Viking I don't know make it red and tall
like Viking would ya if I can blot there
no I don't know I didn't send them that
in like the like custom of these so yeah
there's customs really good what is this
we like computer pits liquidy a thread
and that's called Viking blood the
Viking blood but you guys want for me
Tobias fritto 549 thank you I sent EVGA
an email because the kingpin 1080i I
bought from another guy is coil whining
very loud what are you guys thinking EJ
will replay or D do I think they will
I've heard them before of some there was
I think a small issue with coil on but I
don't know you're gonna ask EVGA we're
not really Erica I'm one dollar here
come one dollar thank you Chris Goodman
$4.99 wanting to build a game server
what would be the best setup for this
the game is an arc and will be a
dedicated server any thoughts I haven't
made game servers in a really long time
but I did use to make them I it's cool I
hate giving a masters like this but it
depends it depends on the game I don't
know how the arc server I'm gonna be
right back I'm gonna go use a little
girl okay so I'll be back all right
I don't know how thee yeah I'll come
back how the arc
server behaves but maybe run it on a
computer you already have and get some
friends in there and then load up like
task manager or hardware info or
something and monitor the load level on
each of the components and then you can
sort of start deciding how much does he
care about frequency versus core count
versus GPU I would imagine it's pretty
much all CPU on these things so it
depends entirely on the game my best
advice is get
current computer tells her on the server
have your friends join it and then
monitor the usage from there and then
figure figure out the rest so Joe is
going to clean off the KP card one more
time and try repay stting it again and
then hopefully we can hit the 2600
megahertz that he wants to hit Kevin
Hardesty 199 thank you classic mini DIY
$1 thank you and again $5 thank you are
you guys still in NC I run a channel
down in Charlotte and love your content
yes we are in NC Matt are are $5 would
there be any benefits to using a pad
instead of paste
since the paste seems to freeze and
crack it would be worse unfortunately
New Age Newton I'll stop there new hey
it's $5 be honest Joe you only went to
get away from the love bugs
Adams Schumann's senior $5.00 I need a
chicken clock sure it's $5 bribe for cat
treats to make it happen well thank you
for the support and continued interest
in that I'm gonna check out normal chat
how's that going what is the spray good
question
what camera is used for the stream by ex
devs as well so the spray is we're not
like sponsored by them or anything but
CRC it's just a contact cleaner I bought
that from Lowe's you can get it at any
local hardware store so that just blast
the hell out of the paste and cleans it
off pretty quickly and efficiently and
then ex devs asked what cameras used for
the stream and we are using a UX 180 for
the stream and Andrew mans that the
whole time so it keeps a bit more active
it's a lot of work come blows out okay
cool good sounds good
so yeah UX 180 and then we're using
wireless labs for the rest
let's see if the veeram heat sinks are
hot to the touch should I be worried
not necessarily hot to the touch versus
like too hot for the vrm or different
things
human sixty degrees Celsius hot to the
touch but a lot of MOSFETs can take 125
150 degree Celsius do you want to be
that hot but they can take it so if it's
hot to the touch that might be between
50 and 70 degrees Celsius depending on
your your personal kind of like thermal
sensitivity and that's not really bad
but you know you start getting into the
90s it doesn't feel great it can take it
but you know it's always better to be a
bit cooler I'm just taking the normal
chats right now
any thoughts on tinkering with some
stuff like FPGAs no I have no experience
with that all right what does the best
thrown place to use on GPS while doing
this we are currently using kingpins kpx
paste Roman Deborah also makes some
extreme cooling pace like cryo not and
I'm sure there's other stuff out there
but those are the only two we ever use
yeah those are the main ones crying out
in kpx loose tea is like gelid or Gilad
yeah we want to say it
Gellert extreme him car should be hot
enough then it's pretty much float
already
what was the spray being used I answered
that one adjust a CRC yeah that stuff's
amazing we used to call it a magic spray
because like if you have paste in the
socket you can just spray it out you
don't have to try to use a toothpick or
anything like that
which I kind of laugh at when I see what
you people try it like yeah if you want
to try it that's up to you what's the
baby
oh she make sure get any Vaseline off
there oh man these handles are froze you
having trouble over there Steve you need
me to help yeah yeah a helping hand
always having trouble with it's all
right I'm here for you and it's kind of
impressed with the dye on this thing
a massive yes that's like serious
there's a lot school and I think that's
the issue
I might have to replace paste after a
couple benches cuz yesterday when we did
this as soon as we fired it up member I
was running about 25 60 right off the
bat then I broke it down that way we had
something good for the stream right
would obviously be chicken coop well
I'll take take your time on getting it
back up and we'll make this one of the
last attempts hopefully yeah if it works
now I should be fine this time this is a
good opportunity to talk in more detail
about the setup for this stuff if you
did want to try it at home so obviously
there's some safety things safety of the
hardware making sure you don't kill it
say to yourself with liquid nitrogen
handling but and we've talked about that
in the past although obviously read up
on it make sure you understand any risks
I don't wanna make it sound like it's
too bad but I also don't you know don't
want people to be careless safety of the
hardware though a lot of it is going to
be insulation making sure you're like
Vaseline yeah you need that so you can
use a couple different things people use
sometimes conformal coating liquid
electrical tape
I used to use electrical liquid
electrical tape all the time but trying
to get that stuff off is kind of like I
don't know impossible I mean it's not
very easy
to do it works pretty well it could
cause some heating issues too sometimes
but it's just an absolute pain like if
you never want to use the card for
anything else again that's kind of what
you do but if you ever want to resell
stuff or you're right want to use it in
your daily after you're kind of done
benching it I'd recommend Vaseline the
the trick with it is just really
cleaning it which can be a pain because
Vaseline is a little bit annoying right
right
someone says $2,000 a camera is cheap I
would agree with you the UX 180 was like
4 grand when I bought it though and then
we also have an a7 r3 with the you know
they need a lot of room though yeah
that's kind of the pain yeah for
overclocking yeah I mean yeah a 7r3 with
a $2,200 lens has been what we used for
the factory tours Oh people ask how what
power where we at
we never never really got to reading it
oh yeah we got a table read yeah it just
was instantly not stable so we had to go
back and someone says could you just use
plastidip instead it's the same thing as
it wants to like liquid electrical tape
it's still a pain to get it number one
it's a pain to apply depending on what
you're applying to on a GPU it's just a
pain to take off a lot of the times you
might rip off a component when you're
trying to get it off uh-huh
it depends on how thick you apply it but
it's also kind of a pain to apply
because it pretty much when you're
spraying it or you're playing it it kind
of goes everywhere right so I mean you
can use it it's very similar to it but
it okay again if you don't mind wasting
your graphic card and never one though
do anything with it
I mean 10 says post the score beat the
VIN bow has been Bo Vince my chest yeah
it says post the score using that name
for like ever
we got our make sure you take that score
home and upload it we're gonna beat that
score
hopefully it up why I've saved one for
me okay hopefully it applies your
to it if you uploaded from home I don't
want credit for that I'll take credit
for the CPU overclock yes I have I am
will having a higher score after this
one I knew this is good of help I see
yeah
just gotta make sure it's nice about
right because what was it what's the
high score on there let's see someone
posted or 3d mark Hall of Fame cuz
yesterday I think we have a
documentation over time spy extreme
single card and well keep in mind too
that we could plug in the 31 75 X
processor we really wanted to go ham
yeah but it does help in TSE though oh
yeah
well yeah you're talking to make major
course and then you're also talking
about uh what the heck is it I can't the
memory of it yeah but the offset what is
that the AVX AVX eeeh yeah so the
current leading score is 10,000 521
points I'm gonna be bent and our current
highest 95 51 yeah where I'm like fifth
place then yes but they're also all on
liquid nitrogen the cpu yeah there are
TX
oh no that has to be well is that a bug
John on the second one was the CS empty
yes n7 I'll check in a second
number 1 is a 0 at 30 that's why ya 3175
addicts on the first drop yes we have
but yeah yeah display of a Bertha's you
pick your score though let's see let's
see graphics core yeah graphics core a
single card
I mean word we can still definitely push
it more what we have now hidden Pinhas
19th year so I'm thinking he doesn't
really bench now he doesn't bitch talk
to my body you what does he do you know
what he likes these days I know you like
sport no Royal yeah I think that's the
big one for him
okay back to normal
nice let's go okay this is Bishop you
have what we do every every time you GPU
bench that's why it's such a pain
because if you have an issue with your
CPU and I meant then all of a sudden you
got to break down everything yeah say
you have an issue with your CPU and your
GPU is good you could get a break
everything down heat it up again and
basically make sure it's good start over
yeah it's a little tedious sometimes but
if you love doing it it's quite
enjoyable when do we need to your flight
759 is when it leaves yeah so we need to
leave here at like 6:00 yeah that's when
we have it if you are resigning stuff
but we do have to sign Matt mousepads
so it's almost 4:00 it'll take us maybe
after days an indication maybe 30
minutes to sign the amount of orders we
have right now so you probably want to
try and stop in about an hour
that's fine I want to get a good run
first yeah can't go out like that so
we're gonna get another run going that
shouldn't take long now
tin says you can run portroyal events
around with us every 980 x e yeah the
problem is we don't have it on this OS
right I don't think so
yeah I think your key was weird it might
be it might need to be installed or
something yeah any questions I'll see
you perchance so we got a couple - Joe
$5 my 6600 KS 4.8 on air but V course
days have 1.45 even went down clocking
at idle T 100 megahertz B course at the
Otto and BIOS motherboard is an ACC 170
game and why because it's set to auto
and yeah my thesis I would actually set
it to like a manual voltage and tested
which one you want so you could probably
go much lower
yeah for sure we had a guy that actually
was saying that yesterday and he said
thank you because they you did the same
exact thing yeah and we dropped it down
anyway I think it
from like 1.4 to like 1.2 yes yes so
we've seen that on some boards in the
past where you know there's a board
we'll run it like 1.4 and then you
manually do it you're stable at like
like 1.19 yeah Auto is like kind of like
suggested which probably shouldn't be
but and it's it's like a lazy pin for
the manufacturers to if they just blast
the voltage auto it'll it'll be stable
yeah I think there's a variance right
right of depending on what GP or CPU
like the lottery you get yeah Christoph
camel Meier give $5 thanks for these
streams they inspired me to get some old
hardware to bench on harbor bots really
there you go love hearing that
that's awesome yeah saving for a now on
to pot now if I can stop buying boards
and that'll be cool and oh it sounds
quite an addiction that's for sure
yeah I love seeing that kind of message
they slacker men named swagger and I was
like someone you'd be friends with is he
stealing my thunder $1 thank you see see
$5 Linus plans to test a loop order
because he doesn't believe it matters
apparently you asked him about it I
didn't ask him about it on the water
clean video I told him loop so okay few
things does loop order matter in quotes
matter is like a big question mark of
what does that mean if your definition
of matter is that the other than like
things like scientific matter read
actually that definition of does it
matter
is the clock higher on the GPU the
answer objectively is yes if it's Pascal
or Torian or anything else that's
frequency thermal relationship so yes
like it's look at our any of our reviews
of the cards we have the nosy stepping
chart I know the temperature in there
and often in the first two rows I ran a
full stock and it's got a lower
temperature because that hasn't run yet
then the second run is the same like
settings or maybe the third or fourth
same settings as the previous or the
higher temperature has been running so
it got hotter and the frequency goes
down why does it go down because they
are thermal dependent so it doesn't
matter so yes if you hit a GPU first in
the loop and you've got like 500 watts
going through that card because
overclocked pretty high or something
that were Fort Lee and I'll be more
reasonable maybe 400 watts that's going
to be a big difference versus if it hits
the CPU maybe a 500 watt X 299 CPU no
like we're running here and then it hits
the GPU that water's warm now so if
you're 5 degrees 10 degrees higher on
the GPU that does impact the clocks now
it does it matter like does it impact
the frame rate well not too much maybe
max 1 to 3 FPS something like that so it
depends on how you define that phrasing
but for a competitive overclocking like
we were sort of doing there several OOP
separate loops yeah because it matters
it doesn't matter yeah a couple did
different degrees they did I mean on a
different cards - yeah and it could make
a big difference yeah I mean like was it
980ti I don't understand that like - is
fairly well informed on this I don't
know how he doesn't because that's right
during the laptop fate he was like I
don't believe you that the GPS is
responds to thermal Z it's it's thought
that means when you add liquid nitrogen
don't respond yeah right like that's
number one demonstration but it was 3.0
is where that was entered
anyway yeah that's my Iran top there
holes it does someone says loop order
does not matter a rad placement matters
okay we're not talking about like where
it goes in the case I'm talking like on
an open-air bench so that's not even the
consideration here yeah pump speed is
important obviously but the the point is
not really loop order the point is
thermal depend I think chats getting
like a thinking this is too much right
loop order it's about how much the
frequency responds to thermals that's my
point because that's that's the
discussion I had with Linus where he
didn't believe me that the frequency
does actually change quite a bit with
the temperature it's not about loop
order there it's about the temperature
impacts we're like we needed like some
type of disclaimer yeah what the hell
we're talking about yeah see it's not a
not a pump order or a loop order thing
as much as it is thermal frequency
interaction questions all right we're
getting there about minus 50 again to Jo
two dollars also on latest BIOS written
with the most settings definitely I
don't over youth guarding the 6600 K I
mean that five dollars support Gianna
and the over guard guy Thank You AJ the
tech one dot moving frag twenty dots
have you considered lapping the GPU died
I saw their marelok in the TP died for a
better result well Joanne answer that
real quick
yes they usually scuff it up yes I do
that if you noticed like you'll see
numbers on it on the die they kind of I
usually smooth them out so you got to be
very careful obviously you don't want to
ruin a very expensive GPU right usually
I scuff it up a little bit and lap it a
little bit not too crazy just so that so
it's flat completely because you even we
saw yesterday when we mounted the the
GPU onto the PI it actually transferred
the numbers onto the pot yeah so like I
like the imprinted imprinted it onto the
pot so you can tell it
doing that and actually laughing a
little bit it will help to be honest
right right alright so sixty yeah so
we're about to do a run yeah yeah I'm
gonna go up to one point four volts are
you stay at one point
no I'm stay at one okay I know it runs
this so okay i just want to i gotta
torch the pot again uh AJ the tech Oh
got that one thank you um any other
question
yes oh exhale exhale Dexter team 49 J
tested loop order and it does not matter
once again we're talking about the GPU
temperature not quite as much about the
loop order also I can definitely make
the loop order matter if I wanted to
like you run a long enough loop or
something you know with a weak enough
pomp it it starts having there's too
many variables there's a lot of
variables you can't just to say that it
no yeah like at some point you can make
it matter for sure and also depends on
maybe what Walker using yeah and like
there's a lot of what pump you're using
we were using a yeah excuse like a weak
pump or something and that uh but again
that's that's not the point
yeah just like on Nvidia the GPU
frequency will be higher if the
temperature is lower yeah you baby your
OC room will be lower if you write
depending on what you do now this has
nothing to do with loot border right now
I talk like you could have a loop that's
only the GPU and if the loop is higher
is hotter for whatever reason maybe
you're running at a higher ambient
temperature then that's the frequency
will be lower that's just how it behaves
that was really the question not the
loop order let's see next one dark wolf
ten dollars best hour see guide for an
eighty seven hundred K on the ARS elite
mother would I don't know I've thought
my head but overclock dotnet has some
pretty good guides on their forums these
are always figuring yeah there's not too
much to do on the gigabyte stuff you can
just sit make sure you set LLC and
voltage
there's your there's your OC guide yeah
usually I I want to say they had the top
one that they have is extreme and then
they have a turbo usually on the 8700
you want to set the turbo on air and
water and then for the load line I
forget it might have a different name in
there
each manufacturer has a different one
and I float from board different boards
all the time right but it said that and
then you just set up your multiplier in
kashin that's pretty much it and what's
your chip needs what voltage it is U is
based upon what it needs
yeah yeah so let's get this clock going
home
ten says he's taking a nap before work
oh yeah it's four yeah I'm there
he says bearded hardware thanks for the
stream good luck with chicken clock in
done stay ha ha ha no it should be
better no of course he's gonna leave it
I guarantee you we like have a great
clock oh yeah everybody's not gonna
believe it
so I think we are we are approaching the
end for hopefully this overclocking if
it goes well on that one Paul you've got
your voltages set
yeah you want to go higher no okay Gil
Durnin yesterday level 10 ll see you
okay with that yeah so based upon
yesterday when I poke down and I did
paste I know that this works okay all
right it should work
the problem is is something we we
actually win that's why Tim was
basically kind of busting us the whole
time okay because that's really how you
shouldn't run so you really should go
right - yeah that's right aways in this
architecture because of how hot that GPU
is right right you guys made me paranoid
about using my AI oh I was already
scared about using you shouldn't really
need to be scared of using an AI Oh like
they don't I know they're like the most
simplest water cooling yeah I love
working with CLC is because it's like
it's the fat it's faster to mount than
an air don't worry about filling the
lube yeah three different things I was
actually fighting that when I was pre
testing for our AMD so ah I'm like I
could use the arrow or I can set up this
hole because I have a lot of water yeah
of course I'm supposed to do some videos
on some stuff and I'm like should I set
up this or should it and I'm like which
one's easier right your mics on
someone's asking no no it's yeah let me
know Andrew if you noticed that yeah
well I probably heard it off yours we
probably heard it through man yeah now
you don't need to be worried about it
closely flick be cool or just on a per
model basis sometimes there are issues
like the H 115 I plan I'm se the white
version specifically had an issue where
the coolant was leaking before it got to
the customer in which case hopefully you
didn't have a leak in your system it
just ran too hot yeah and that should be
something you notice immediately but
that was like a specific issue with
with that production run the NR max1 has
some issues with the water they're using
interaction with the chemicals they're
using where it can create some gunk and
that's like a specific cooler model
issue the ASA tech ones or the a tech
made ones they're all reasonably safe to
use failure rates pretty low on those
ffs poke - no I want to see your name on
the port royal benchmark well they will
start submitting one at some point why
does the GPU have a minimum temperature
so why do you stop at like - whatever
you're stopping at - 130 for example my
is 100 um well the the thing is is I
don't want to get it too cold too quick
cuz you'll see like how we failed before
when it gets too cold all of a sudden
bad things start happening like the
memory maybe bug out or right like
there's water that goes in underneath a
chip and just starts causing crazy
issues so you kind of want to maintain
temperature and only go with cold as you
need it right so we really don't know
that max we know what we were doing
yesterday so I don't want to I know at
minus 100 that I can do plus 400 or plus
450 on this GPU so it's basically just
to make sure that the car doesn't get
too cold to be able to write it doesn't
ruin our benching basic right cuz you
already saw like ruined yes last
matching because we took two up so
and it seems to be a paste paste thing
too I was nervous about areas also there
are some horror stories online exploding
and destroying systems I've never heard
of a CLC that's a first for me to like
exploding explode is a little bit
hyperbolic I think well I guess maybe
like if you had a fitting pop yeah they
would amuse plastic and stuff me yeah we
could maybe I've never personally seen
it and I've had a lot of I just I don't
know that the word explode is really
good yeah it's not like a it shouldn't
be a pressure buildup if that's
happening is there's a big problem well
I know isn't there um if you use
different types of metals and you don't
have a perfect thing isn't there a way
that they can bill prep yeah yeah well
so yeah pressure will build obviously by
heating up the liquid but isn't there
like if you have an aluminum versus
copper and then you don't have anything
for corrosion treatment yeah isn't there
something that can cause so pressure
it's not really as much of an issue as
just like getting a bunch of gunk from
all the corrosion and then like I
thought there was a block manufacturer
that put out like a notice on it if
you're going to use something yeah there
are maybe it was a specific cooling
right there was actually there was one
of those yeah that's where I'm getting
it might have been to ek who published
that I don't remember who published the
coolant notice yeah so yeah we saw we
just read 400 no problem why is he not
wearing gloves
I mean we've we've done this already but
let's just yeah sure ow
[Laughter]
that would be way evaporates like
instantly yeah yeah so I know a we've
we've done this but let me just I'll go
through it quickly again dangers a
balance you would include like the tanks
need to have a pressure release so it
needs to let some air out so it doesn't
like build up too much pressure and
explode but you know we just kind of
trust that these are made properly and
they do we can hear it leaking like the
whole time yeah so it's got a pressure
release that's probably the one benefit
of it leaking there was no of it you
know it's a yeah yeah
and there is a PSI valve on it like a
meter so you can look at if you're
really concerned but not not too much of
an issue if you if the company's well
we're also using low pressure tanks yes
high pressure tanks so that's also
another benefit of using low pressure
it's gonna be way less pressure yeah I'm
scared of because the more high pressure
obviously the more dangerous and then
again soaking is the concern so you soak
it into your clothes that'll hurt you
close your head you cup your hands
that'll hurt and then other than that I
guess oxygen don't do it in a really
small room with no air flow yeah and we
always have a we have our little
indicator yep does the torch light yes
or no if it does not light there's no
oxygen and ventilate the room or leave
it
all right there was a good score I think
95 11 was that better than any one we
had before see this is why I like so on
a non cold card so like an initial card
this is what makes it you could tell we
were in 95 51 previously yeah total
score yeah total worth yeah 9550 one
that was plus four hundred and sixteen
hundred okay maybe I'm lying then
alright so we're gonna actually run it
again I'm gonna go right to 450 I'm sure
were kind of like near the ended and
then I'm gonna start pushing it a little
bit more and more the will jump to like
1.4 after this one cuz I know 450 ran at
this fun right so there's no reason to
chicken clock it up no I say we just go
for go for it at this point yeah this is
the time to go for it this is kind of
what I was waiting for normal chat
question what a copper IHS cool well
with liquid nitrogen well the problem
yeah yeah go ahead
well to run all the piping so you know
much of a pain it is to just do like
normal water cooling like you how much
it is the loop and stuff yeah it'd be a
lot harder with liquid nitrogen and a
lot more expensive if you look at the
Robo Walker yeah instead there's to be
honest people
it's gonna be so expensive to set up
it's possible but it can also be
dangerous because if you have a lot of
pressure build-up so you'd have to have
one of these things and then have it
hooked up to morning you return to write
in a return well or another's had
there's another guy that actually made
another system that was really an
automatic one my buddy Brian but uh he
had one that would didn't need a return
system doesn't work yeah Robo clogger
was basically closed-loop liquid
nitrogen it's pretty cool but it was
very difficult to you know for events to
kind of make and maintain just go right
the moon for it's basically a CLC for
Allen's you though yeah it's a little
difficult did you see how hard it was
like put together
I was not trivial who's that - oh okay
that's way how's that - my 15 we're
gonna raise it to one before what were
you for that - I was at my standard okay
Seanie be colder yeah it just needs to
be out - one good thing we've been
chicken clucking all day yeah a little
bit of cold scale the 1.4 should help
though you're going through these faster
now though that's good yeah it's cuz
we're you're pushing more so like the
higher you push the clocks the more on -
you're gonna go through right
see super chats we got Vegeta kicker nor
weed in $20 do a pro fist
thank you squirrel these $20 Joe your
beard is as boss as Steve's hair thanks
Barsky that's two I like to read the
rest your name
that's two two dice pour one for all of
the dead GPUs we should recap that so
all my dead GPUs Dalian that GPU home
okay now we got that one now sixteen vs
Cir schoolboy to the highest why does
yeah we always got that one minimum
temperature
Kyle Glasgow two dollars favorite me
ghost rapper I don't know what that
means is it core offset I don't know
what that means I'm sorry Ziggy two
dollars Frank are five live's
overclocking my to KP 2080 eyes and so
980 excellent idea nice jumped back
number 28 and the times my extreme Hall
of Fame where's your 3125 axe it is not
out right now we wanted to keep it
simple you know we're getting to know
the GPU right yeah focus on one thing at
a time
yeah usually what I do is write like
I'll do I'll run a couple sessions like
this to kind of get to know that youth
you cuz if you're gonna manage like a
big system like the 28 core you need to
know that you do before you do anything
so what is your you're a lot more active
right now than earlier on this pouring
so what is what is your temperature
target just between 1.8 130 I don't want
to go too cold I'm just kind of hover in
here it seems to like it so I'm at 4
plus 450 which is probably like 25 60
right
am I at 1 point 4 volts sure try not to
get too cold right now yeah I want to
keep it hot that that's the key like you
saw that we were like chicken pocket
yeah and then we're really long in
between sessions and that what that does
is it actually makes the carb much
colder yeah and that's when you start
getting issues you kind of want to be a
little bit quicker with GPU vention with
liquid nitrogen so usually what I'll do
is I'll find out like a
fuck that I'm used to and next time I
benched I'm gonna go right to that as
soon as I start right and that way like
you don't keep on chicken clucking
that's where I kind of the term comes
from yeah that makes sense
well of course that's not the best thing
this dream right you need some
anticipation all right kind of like my
part to the apex video just saying
Ziggy if I thought it'd be worth its
deal it might seem even polish my IHS
well it depends on the cpu if it's uh
like in 87 okay and yeah it's worth it
leftie live liquid metal you get a lot
higher with that 100k to but it's a lot
more work it's so much more working and
there's a bit more risk involved yeah
it's not as easy as the 8700 K or the
7700 K or the 60 Sony yeah anything
that's soldered is just it starts on
wind territory where it's not worth it
for China the average use yeah and then
also with the 9900 K since it's soldered
I think that the IHS gets a little bit
more warped so you you might as well
laugh at - right to be honest like you
could probably just get away with
lapping it and it would be better yeah
yeah cuz I had a my one of my chips
I would do about 5 2 or 15 and then I
lapped it and then I could do 5 3 or 15
so it was really off - so when sanding
so you can tell yeah but there's a big
benefit but of course you're gonna lose
your warranty so but really nice that
you get always this paint it paint it
silver and then write on it with a
sharpie or a good like stamp it with
your signature yeah too soon
just saying too soon all right so this
was a good run
archivo you want to write down for you
yes I'll save this one to you oh well
that's that's a little fall careful
yeah 96 on there that's a nice score
9600 is a high score what do you have
plus 496 27 in it 9450 I think at 1600
mem okay 450
what are the give me the FPS numbers
well done one sec let me just sit at the
475 moving now yeah so it's 59 21 and
then 54 54 ATS I got it okay go get some
that's not real an improvement for both
of them yeah but you see how easy it is
to go like up now this is before so if
you keep on chicken clucking ah so
you're not really getting the real
benefits all right it might take a
couple sessions when you're first going
to learn what the GPU likes and then you
just go right to it you don't have to
like worry about it you just go right
down yeah so I'm gonna go back up and
then start it - 125 isch yeah yes shish
Baha truck guy attended missed the
stream yesterday late for this one don't
forget his mother's day loved with her
host of lion so thank you for tuning in
Christopher Shaffer $2 can you say hi to
my wife Megan hi Megan hi Megan happy
Mother's Day
yeah your mother all right Kyle class
five guys her come over at GN I can't
I'm overclocking her I'm going to use
dynex their own pace GN cronut is an
affordable high quality when it cuts off
okay okay Jason Morris two dollars thank
you so you're holding this is I feel
like we're really moving now yeah
that's why I didn't we kept on busting
yeah but it was kind of fun to do that
the power meter people are freaking
actually this is a good time to check
the power meter cuz we're at are we a
gt1 right now
yeah 602 is 610 watts turn it down now
612 watts 611 I'll keep an eye on it for
gt2 yeah I'll tell you when GT dude well
you'll see this spike because it will
drop it and then it will go in yeah I'm
gonna be like a big initial - so we're
like over 600 basically well we're at
550 now so lower intensity part of the
benchmark
yeah GT ones about to come to close all
right done now we're gonna go do okay
GG - so now RINO 90 watts right now yeah
I mean the drop quacks all right it's
about the start okay about the kickoff
now we kicked off so GT - Wow 670 watts
yeah somebody watch more than TQ one
that's why I was running GT - yeah you
could tell GT 2 is the the main part of
the benchmark 646 hundred so we're
between six hundred and sixty seventy
depending on the intensity no we failed
I just saw off to a hundred yeah that's
usually when you know
all right so what are we at
so we did 475 let's keep that maybe
adjustable to do a little bit more
everyone's happy that they got the power
read off team wattmeter assemble we're
gonna try like change the load by okay
yeah cuz I meant one for yeah I was
gonna say I want to see one for and like
level zero or level one I kind of want
to see I almost want to just run gt2
okay it'll be fast yeah I just that way
because we're not messing around no they
don't click I can't stand what it does
that
it's good to have you be there see ya
it's called that a couple of times when
I'm the spotter well it's done that to
me Li that's annoying the trick is to
click out of the window for it builds
I'd taught me that one click out of the
window and then click back in who has
time for that yeah this might be good if
you want to check the full volts ok or
we're wattage let's see
probably going a little bit too cold
though what are you - 130 yeah now
filled damn well was that 653 before it
failed no I'm in heat up a little bit I
wonder if that's an issue you rent -
like 115 yesterday I thought
yeah but we're also higher now yeah that
did not like that at all
that almost seems like that was actually
a load line if you
why aren't you saving your scores I I
don't think we really care right now now
this is not real scores usually if I
benched yourself in CPU full-bore yeah
after you get to know the GPU then
that's when you match them up
what clocks are we running at do you
know where where we are for Jack we're
at plus 475 which is over Carly almost
2,600 almost 2,600 I heard something
yeah
yeah she was filled so 1609 and before
475 let me try this
actually I'm gonna put the load line
back down and just lower the temp back
down to easier or harder well it's
harder if it's at actually was at 10
yeah to the time then yeah because we
read out
one-thirty Sam Dean hey guys let's
donate to people who are doing nothing
but for an Alan to in a can
gee thanks yeah yeah okay I don't know
you're still what people don't really
like okay thanks for watching you've got
us I mean it's like I don't you can
apply that to anything yeah keep
donating to people just playing games
entertaining millions of people go have
fun gaming yeah right it's amazing like
especially with all the big gaming
channels you have nowadays yeah
no not even didn't run no I think it
might be shot try a couple things I'm
you should invite a Sam Dean out to your
OC competition tell him to pay his way
there and you can see how easy it is to
pour out onto it into account that's all
you do right pretty much you just pour
onto you into a cab
need to reboot
it's not happy it might need to be
heated up a bit the problem is is that
CPU test is so long that basically gets
so cold during that fear it drops talks
through about 300 yeah
GPU dropped yeah I stopped attacking
yeah totally out there twenty six
hundred megahertz about twenty six on
earth okay well that's pretty damn good
yeah
do we find
10:10 says tell Big Boi to drop the
memory clocks might be worth trying I
guess from 1600 maybe I'm 15 16 15 14
back to 15 yeah just to get a higher
core for now it could be too much stress
yeah not a good not a bad thoughts on
said she's done ski well said
so he got reading chats someone says
I'll donate to see you got you shave
live Joe there's that Thomas ever geez
done there Pinot devote Fogle apparently
I don't know that is that focal or Fogel
focal is that from was that super bad
it's a last name Fogle and it means bird
and German really thinks is from from
memory I think so from my four to five
years of German I take let's see now I
gotta look it up there's otherwise your
Omer will give me give me crap you got
to think of oh yeah yeah bird it's
German for bird yes that's interesting
learn something new every day set the
power on the driver to max performance
for myself oh yeah it is okay where did
that cool when can we see fan LA two
dollars when can we see RGB mod Mads day
after never yeah yeah no current like
Lance sure we could mod one that to have
to see if it not about to
Oh pnow is big bird from Sesame Street I
didn't know that I know I know
I don't know what what does that mean
what does that mean I have no idea you
sounded so surprised like you had an
epiphany moment well because you had a
let us go bogel wasn't the names here
okay peanut is okay that was part of the
name is a full bodied character the
Dutch co-production obsessed I was
reading Oh the Dutch version Pino is a
large blue bird that represents the
psychological age of a 40 year old
okay well I guess that's they just
ruined big bird for me haha we are also
the full bodied version having
psychological age of four-year-olds do
this
alright turn it up heat up did you drop
the memory clock yeah okay
so we gotta figure out where we're
calling at some point probably dude yeah
I'm gonna drop it to minus 50 and then
bring it back again and see what it does
get a stable around in there yeah I
think the CPU bar this thing between
that just waiting for
there I mean in 450 was running like a
can right hey someone says when one
minute ruins your childhood all right so
we got a couple super chats I'll read
through okay
we got CC that's $5 Thank You Pat plants
$5 bottom out spat great stream guys
thank you very much for thanks shada
we're gonna have that's what we're gonna
have to make sure we have enough time
for those but I think we'll be good
shoots ajar Bowl $10 late to the party
but wanted to give you a bump for the
great content thank you very much for
the sport Damian Basnet $3 howdy howdy
hi and Peter the fun Brown Stewart's $5
thank you it's so easy a robo Parker can
do it Nick best to $1 thumb law $2 when
can we see our GBM Hodnett so I got that
one
Jacob Parrish $10 Thank You Nick bass $5
Isis Regent you Joe I see your RAM as
Mark that's best
what frequency and timing does it reach
well those wins so basically there's
four modules in there and there are two
different kits ones a gold Kate and ones
a silver kids so I took the two best out
of the kit out of each dual-channel Kate
and I wouldn't say they're my best
memory but they're they're really good
memory the newer rgv ones so I think
they did about which is IMC limited the
one chip that I have on the 9900 K is
kind of crappy so it would do with like
48 about 4,800 yeah CL 14 13 13 nice it
does really nice that is very good
yeah you'll see them in the apex part 2
video okay cause we'll be like the
headline I think it's like yeah it's
pretty pretty high on memory yeah right
there I'm actually I am see with it
no yes yeah they probably do actually
higher that moments probably 5k Cody
lankford $5 I want to build an old setup
off of ebay so I can do some
overclocking that is a great idea good
idea would you guys recommend an m3
setup or an LGA 1150 which do you think
would be more fun
1150 Berlin 1150 I guess the alternative
is like FX for you yeah but your own
only for frequency so your no
performance right ov
I don't know I guess you're gonna learn
cold on it but I don't know
I would my preference would probably be
the 1150 yeah that's just cuz you're an
Intel shill Joe no it's just those chips
were just so much fun to be honest that
it was a good a good time yeah to play
baja truck guy five guys I think it's
dead Steve gotta eight six four five
dollars just bottomed out bad cheers
thank you alright so let's hope this
holds this time
what are your settings Oh 475 okay it's
the same it's just memories drop but 475
encore
it looks like it just beats up on pace
cuz I just heat it up usually that's a
pace kit Vince told me that they loves
to beat up pace so right so this is not
out of the ordinary we used to have to
do this quite a bit actually if it gets
too cold and that's what if you leave it
way too cold the paste and the bond
between just doesn't work that much so
by doing the torch it actually kind of
melts the paste and warms it up so that
way it's better interaction or just
there so soaks yeah
it bonds I bet if we to be honest I bet
if we sanded the pot down and put a
scuff on it and probably better I think
that might be it with the plating right
cuz to be honest all my pots are pretty
much lap I'm gonna check the wattage
before that run ends well it's only gt2
but yeah 568 right now 570 and this is
the lower
yeah it's that low lower right of the
bench 600 yeah usually any that one
where you saw the peak was a certain
section yeah I know that section 641
right there that was a nice gt2 so it
passed yeah but it's just easy to look
at Cole do try it for a run now yeah I
was at 5503 that was a big a big gt2
we're gonna end up running the whole
thing to get that we would get a squat
okay well you can't get a score doing
customers any more of this no I think we
have to I think it'd probably be plenty
for now yeah we'll see it depends our
part run so we're starting to approach
for 75 it has to be about 26 I think we
can check before we break it down
approaching well you could tell it like
that if you add do some math I know you
don't like math there Steve tennis to
lunch at nice
yeah how did you take your nap yeah I
died again I'm fighting this one huh
know what I say now
no I tried trying to try and keep up
with chat it's hard to keep on chat
he says four hours before time for work
man can't you just go on whenever you
want it's going I mean Vince is the
kingpins the only one in there who's
gonna know if tins not there just uh
telling the cover for you you're doing
work right now that's right that's high
that's busting our balls media a lot of
work Media Relations actually you should
ask ten if he's gonna be or is he gonna
be back computation yeah yeah I asked
earlier I didn't see the answer ten if
you're there X tabs in chat for extra
EVGA when are you are you going to be at
Computex underneath any days C open a
door in windows they don't pass out no
looks like you'll need some oxygen no we
need some sleep I think yeah we've been
going for like the a couple business be
the third day straight yes it's and
yesterday we were pushing it I don't
know if you added it up yesterday be
there about 16 hours yeah by the time we
want we were done and I mean oxygen is
in the room so you see we are fired
shei by the new logitech wireless mouse
I have no idea I don't pay attention the
new Logitech phone yeah so we're just at
high events is kingpin in here they just
see ex devs no he said birds chirping
because it's uh morning twenty five
thirty megahertz no it's not twenty five
dirty okay so we'll check on that later
cuz our boos clock was higher right to
forego a lower temp and he says he will
be at Computex oh that's good
so that means I get to pick on you the
whole time sorry we'll remember that we
got to do some videos over
oh yeah I'll go get okay go find 10 to 4
video really fun I need dunsky again
we'll do one more heat up but then after
that you wanna get it yeah sure yeah so
we'll do one more run we should figure
out what frequency we're out for the
next one though yeah we can
ten is doing customer support him and
chat apparently overclocking support
hunt standby
yeah axe devs in chat show him so show
some love he's one of the guys who
worked on building this card the kingpin
twenty atti a couple hours ago you
recorded her on GT score he never went
down it was fifty to twenty seven okay
thanks
not 55-27
fifty-two I don't have a 52-27 anywhere
in this log but oh I see a 55-27 eyes
thank you
slash eyes cool thank you I corrected
that in our log we're gonna keep that
I'll just do a full run just make sure
it didn't drop the driver
what's the clock at we'll check as soon
as we get it running we know the
opposite I'd like to know the art now
drop lardo it was at 475 so let's do was
it uh that card is dunsky bro too
temperamental
yeah well the $20 autograph we're off I
mean it's sharpie so eventually it
depends on what you do it well I mean
it'll stay there just don't don't like
use your mouse so we're signing the top
row actually first of all the autograph
doesn't cost any money for the mouse
pads it's it's the same price you pay
for the mousepad so it does not cost
anything we're just doing it for
watching the stream it will not rub off
don't use your mouse on that part of the
mousepad
that's for the mod mat same thing it's
Sharpie like it's it's gonna stay there
just don't don't wash that part of the
pad with alcohol or something that would
you know kill Sharpie Haley fine it'll
stay there my fingers hurt from crossing
my fingers oh that's a burn from ghost
fish and chat hmm 10 did the real word
he can't even just put his name on it
that's I want to be clear that those are
not my words I was just reading them
from so Huff's man it's brutal
that's savagery
[Laughter]
see we got this super chat
Mukunda $2 fine with the toy his mother
OBS reconnection successful okay let's
see if we're still girls dead is it
still going I think are we done
I don't know refreshing my log that's
the right account are we alive still is
the question it looks like we are okay
child saying we are still here
did it drop stream is alive again how
long did it cut out
we're gonna play around here I'm just
gonna go with that kind of super cool
hey Cerie bad looks for just a second
okay well all right cool well sorry
about the jump but I'm glad it's
immediately back that's good but I was
looking at the system to see the OBS cut
out and notice did a job
yeah just for like someone says like 0.5
seconds so we're good
who's gonna do kind of a well thank you
trying to pace just so what is this our
last attempt here like whatever I think
though and their card is just not fun
yeah it's done so let's can we explain
that for people like why at some point
they just stopped cooperating it's not
dead that's clear no no no it's not dead
it's just uh there's a lot of you gotta
figure we're going cold so much that
there's so much kind you can look on the
card now you might want to point down to
this you'll see like all the cold on the
back you got to figure that's all around
the GPU all on the memory I mean we're
at well I just did this for kind of just
to see but we're at minus 146 Celsius
but I you could tell how cold it's
getting around the core and basically
sometimes they just stop functioning
just kind of how it is it's basically
what happens when you liquid nitrogen
stuff yeah
everything gets super cold and then it
just stops responding these are the
times when you break down to protect the
hardware to protect the hardware you
don't want to keep running it like this
otherwise it's gonna you're gonna kill
hardware that's how you kill hardware so
as a pro overclocker I'm basically gonna
kill it and say we're done ski yeah kill
it as in stop we're hit not yeah we
don't we don't want to hurt the car
right you have to use it for other
things but yes that was still fun would
we get the final clock was so the final
classy if I can get 450 offset no
fortunately of course 75 was it yeah
okay so we were so 450 475 shouldn't put
us at up like just shy of 26
just almost 26s Oh which we were at
about like 25 80 or something yeah well
we really should have done is basically
right from the beginning yeah that would
have been a fun stream
yeah his basically go right from where
we left off which would have been for 50
and then 1600 on them right - 115 with a
1 3 and then just start from there right
we've literally been benching this card
for 4 hours 4 hours so it probably just
needs a break it needs some sleep yeah
yeah yeah
it's just how it what happens you need
to kill it I just never touch a running
system someone said
