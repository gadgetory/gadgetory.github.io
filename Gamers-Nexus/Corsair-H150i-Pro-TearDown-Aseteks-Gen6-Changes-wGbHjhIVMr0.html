Corsair 360 millimeter cooler that one
live during CES that's when the embargo
listed which means that honestly that's
probably the one video recently where I
don't think I've even looked at the cons
because it went live during the show
that also means that we didn't really
get a good chance to dig into the cooler
this is the first ASA tech
sixth-generation pump product and that
means it's worth taking it apart so
we're gonna do a teardown of the H 150 I
Pro see what changes have happened if
any underneath the pump housing and look
at what ASA Tech's done for this
generation before that this video is
brought to you by thermal Grizzly makers
of the conductor hot liquid metal that
we recently used to drop 20 degrees off
of our coffee leak temperatures thermal
grizzly also makes traditional thermal
compounds we use on top of the IHS like
cryo not and hydro not pastes learn more
at the link below so a few key things
here the ASA tech sixth-generation pumps
are not that different in terms of
performance from their 5th gen or even
their 4.5 jan or their 4th gen how much
can you really advanced moving liquid
around a series of tubes and radiators
so it's not significantly different than
it different in thermal performance the
biggest difference comes from the fans
on the radiator which is provided by
coarse hair not by ASA tech however from
what we understand other than the PCB on
here and the RGB LEDs that wrap around
the thin form we understand the biggest
difference is primarily pertain to
optimizing the cooler the flow of the
liquid to reduce hotspots in specific
areas of the cooler so it should reduce
potential for exceeding the thermal spec
in very specific areas because even if
your liquid temperatures reading under
60 C per spec for the sensor which is
located in the pump body even if that's
reading fine it's possible somewhere
else in the loop you're over 60 C and if
that's the case you're exceeding spec
and there's potential for damage down
the line or melting plastic or boiling
liquid or whatever so ASA Tech has tried
to correct some of that I don't have the
specifics on how they did so but we can
start tearing the
see the other big difference here is the
cold plate this is a Corsair spec thing
so this cold plates couple millimeters
smaller than the fifth-generation cold
plates which means that theoretically on
on larger heat spreader devices like on
the x99 cpu we tested you might have
some slight loss in performance and in
our testing this pump generation four
generation is seemingly slightly worse
in performance and I say seemingly
because we're really kind of right up
against the margin of error there so
best case no real advantage
worst case marginally worse so the main
changes have been for reliability and
endurance
that's what ace attacks been trying to
drive home and then LEDs so let's take
it apart this one looks pretty
straightforward it's got two four six
eight Torx screws and I think that's
probably a TR nine or eight or something
that's about right yes so they moved two
Torx screws I'm hoping these are easier
to remove than the previous ones as well
because historically a synthetic colours
have been really annoying to take apart
so the reason they've been annoying this
by the way is different as well you used
to be able to torque these plates a
little bit easier you can still bend it
if you really try it I mean I just did
but I think it's slightly more durable
doesn't feel quite as easy to bend in
one hand anymore so that's good I could
definitely still bend it it would right
now but not really relevant because
you're never gonna be doing that so just
revealed a couple other small Torx
screws underneath let's get these out
first so the ASA tech coolers the
biggest concern with disassembly is
stripping stuff because they put the
screws in crazy tight which to their
credit is because it's a device that
contains liquid so you don't want
anything to leak out the sides this is
going to take a while
good Jay this is much easier than the
previous ones I feel it weak you know
cool okay let's start with the cold
plate so that's come off actually much
easier than normally and in terms of
orientation there's three divots on the
sides so let me get our bearings here so
the one that has a divot on the top and
at the bottom is where we orient the in
and the outlets so you can see there's
three right there so I'll just kind of
keep that for future reference but the
split area is going to be up here in
your the top divot let's remove this
gasket so there's your gasket and
basically this is just to help with
pressure and containing the liquid
making it go through where we want it to
go through so you can see that Inlet is
in here or that one of them and the
other ones are up at the sides here and
the liquid is going to flow in to the
micro fins so lots of micro fins it
looks like about the same fin density as
previous AC tech products I'm not really
sure though I'd have to and I don't have
tools that can measure with that level
precision but there's a lot of micro
fins it's what you want for increasing
surface area it spreads the heat over a
larger area of course this is brand new
so it's not conked up or anything like
that
but we can set this aside and start
looking at the the rest of the pump so
far though the in and the out it's a bit
different they've redesigned that I
think I might be able to show it better
once we get in to the next layer okay so
four screws these were dr six size outer
plastic
doesn't do anything oh okay something
just popped out but here's the hot glue
gross
here's that nameplate yeah Corsair cable
obviously and that's just what our LED
is shining through and also the led
around the sides so not too important
although one of the major changes with
these tech pumps I will say okay so
here's our PCB and we're still not
really to the central part of the pump
but it is a new PCB you can tell by
looking at it compared to the old ones
it's also got LEDs in the in several
locations see one just for looks like
maybe four LEDs so the motor really well
the electromagnet anyway a couple copper
wires that were sticking up and attached
to the PCB I had to break those two
separate it but here's the thermocouple
so it's just coated in thermal paste
this sits down into the chamber of the
actual pump body and that's what gives
you your liquid measurement in in the
software of course our link or otherwise
so that's the thermocouple for that
we've got power coming in where all this
black out cabling is and that's also
going to be our fan splitter pump sort
of communication and then pump powers
right there that's the more important
one so those are all going in here
there's your pump power there is the
pump rpm readout and then there's the
fans it's a bit more complex along with
the the controller and everything else
for the chip what interests me and maybe
someone can explain to me why this would
be done this way there's this little I
see it looks like just suspended in
between a hole in the PCB and it's on
both sides and it's attached by solder
joints so my question to you if you know
the answer why is it like that
and I can ask A's attack
they'll be able to get an answer for me
that's kind of a low level thing for an
engineer to they have to go hunt one
down but if you know why someone would
do that let me know I'm curious
anyway let's let's get in further here
so electromagnet and here's you're in
and you're out valve so for future
reference from the top with it oriented
with the tubes up towards the top of the
motherboard it would be coming in
through the right tube and going out
through the left tube which if we look
more carefully
it would mean actually gonna have to
take more of this apart but I think
we're coming it in through here and then
I have to take out the next screw to see
what else we can see
hey that's a big difference okay
now we're getting to the stuff that a
stick actually changed this impeller is
massively different let me get an old
one to give you a comparison this is one
of the EVGA coolers this is a Gen 4.5
pump which is actually a little bit
different than a Jena 5 to the Gen 4.5
has a faster impeller but what we're
looking at is actually does that remove
- no it's got a screw on it okay well
anyway without further dismantling it
you can see the difference in the
impeller is pretty clearly so this is
similar to the Dyna Tron impellers I
mean I don't know who ace tech sourcing
forward or if they're making it
themselves but the point remains it's
similar it's just a little less thick
and you can feel the poles so one two
three four five six seven eight
I think that's right one two three four
five six seven eight yeah so eight
magnetic poles in this one whereas this
is I think these were and I actually
remember these might be these might be
four eight I can't remember exactly
without we can look at other footage but
I can't remember exactly how many
magnetic poles this has but either way I
look at that impeller it's plastic it's
got three blades on it and then you've
got the new one that's kind of a met
and has a much better feel to it overall
it's a larger know if I'm gonna be able
to fish it out of there there we go cool
alright so there's what goes and there
is what it is this might be just a
hardened plastic with some metal on the
bottom side I don't really not positive
the material composition it's kind of
slimy right now so it's hard to really
gauge but either way there's your
impeller significantly different from
the old one this is actually the coolest
part of it for sure is that a stack I
actually changed something
I think I'm not sure but this might be
partly to do with noise I have a feeling
this probably makes less noise now that
said the H 150 I Pro is quite a loud
pump when you set it to a 100% rpm you
can definitely hear the pump it just
like all the other ones even more so
potentially in some cases so I would not
say the pump is particularly quiet check
our review for information on that but
it's definitely been revised in a lot of
ways and that would that's pretty much
all we can see from this this teardown
today there might I think there's some
changes in the barbs as well in here I'm
trying to preserve this a little bit
this time but I think there might be a
change in the barb with the piano wire
but I'm really not sure if you're
curious to learn what's in these you can
check our how a liquid coolers work
video it's the same idea for all of them
but I think we can conclude that there
so that's the H 150 I pro but more
importantly that's the first ace attack
sixth-generation pump the impeller is
quite a bit different the pump block
size overall is a bit different the
design for the in and the out is
different so this 4.5 done pump you can
see it's got just the one in and out
right here
whereas the new one has three different
options or three different areas for the
liquid going in and out so it's got like
a split flow of some kind which I know I
know cool it is big on split flow
designs and I'm not sure how the the
legal stuff works out there between them
but that's it that's the
sixth-generation a stack pump pretty
cool stuff we will probably be testing
more of these as they come out but
Corsairs kind of got a lock on that
market right now in terms of performance
check our review it's not hugely
impressive it's it's another liquid
cooler a closed loop performs like all
the other ones do for the most part they
optimized for silence in the fans and
it's 360 millimeters and those are the
only two real deciding factors aside
