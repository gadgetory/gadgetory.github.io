brought to you by cyberpower who make
the fain book that we recently
overclocked past 4 gigahertz so there's
as I understand it a server wipe coming
the correct in fact well we we do them
periodically once a quarter sir jack
chua Lee one happening you know right
now the immediate moment there's a wipe
but the one that's happening right now
is the second to last the one that's
going to happen at the end of July is
the last one and so after the end of
July when this final white happens that
means from that day forward your
character and your possessions and your
homes and everything about them will
evolve persistently forever now that
still doesn't mean the games done in
fact we we don't think the terms the old
terms of alpha and beta and launched
necessarily mean much to us because in
some ways that's the launch right the
reality it begins that moment but we're
not releasing the full episode one story
until close down into here probably a
December and then of course then the
features aren't you know we're going to
be adding features forever and released
a new content forever so we're not going
to have a time there's not gonna be a
moment where go the game's done
congratulations let's drink some
champagne and you know we're finished
start working on the next one we just
don't perceive that ever happening
anymore yeah that's that's an
interesting point with the industry
right now where I don't know how much of
this can be attributed to the
Kickstarter backer model versus how much
is just the industry evolving but it
seems like a lot of games now have taken
as an example dota or counter-strike
they start with a lower population they
grow over time I don't think that used
to always be the case it seemed yeah
well what's interesting is you know look
at I think the best example is eve
online so Eve when it came out I we know
was not an instant success and now it's
one of the biggest you know online games
out there and so that I think is the the
best model of how to take the kernel of
something that's fun and has a core
market and improve it over time bringing
more people over time and and grow it
into a
property right and you know one of the
one of the tragedies of a lot of the big
publishers these days is they they there
they feel like you know I have to come
out of the gate and beat Wow and the
only way to do that is to over-invest
what Wow has spent basically in their
lifetime to beat to beat all the art and
all the features and all the content
they've created and so they'll go spend
you know half a billion or a billion
dollars on a big you know MMO and then
guess what it doesn't beat the world's
warcraft because it's basically a
reskinned world of warcraft and you know
players you know aren't going to switch
for that and so they give up on MMOs
they just say like well this is way too
expensive way too risky takes way too
long emos are dead i'm out and and of
course it is true that they were on the
wrong strategy but but if you tried to
do like you know what we experience with
tabularasa with ncsoft ncsoft first game
was a mega-hit and and their lineage
game in korea was bigger than wow and
bigger than ever quest and bigger than
all the stuff in the US and so tabula
rasa which launched modestly in the
United States but still profitable
United States we were very happy going
like all right we better we've got a
foot in the door let's start building
and we'll start stealing you know market
for anybody else and ncsoft was already
like that's you know compared compared
to lineage in Korea it's already an it
so they were didn't have the patience or
interest to to try to see one grow and
and so big publishers I think will
struggle with MMOs and so that's why I'm
excited not about what we're doing but I
actually think that you Neela quit grab
McQuaid's doing Marc Jacobs doing chris
Roberts is doing Warren to be doing
pantheon you know these are all people
who know how to make good games they
know how to do a really good gameplay
I'm excited about all of those i'm
confident they will you know be strong
contenders but they will start modestly
with tens of thousands or hundreds of
thousands of people and some or all of
them i believe will get the opportunity
to grow into millions right yeah yeah it
does seem like the the new model
especially for mmos with shroud of the
avatar what's your who
you see as your core market who's the
core player well the you know so so I'm
lucky enough to have had you know 30
years of creating games called altima
that have its own core market and so
that really is my core market is the
people who have have experienced my
earlier work now that being said the the
challenge for me and our team is to make
a game that is accessible enough to
bring in youngsters who frankly are too
young to have experienced a lot of our
earlier work you know I have a posters
of all the games we've ever made on the
wall and near it i have posted notes
with the birth dates of all my employees
and about a third of my employees were
born before i published my first game at
cala bassa but another third of them
weren't born until like after Ultima 6
you know as I'm going like these are a
bunch of me until after Ultima Online
and so it's like okay I you have to
really completely reset your
expectations ago there's you know the
majority of gamers could not have
experienced all that right and so the
risk for us is to make the game so
deeper in which can be interpreted so
complicated that people don't get a
chance to really special people are
accustomed to playing first-person
shooters or these very visual rich but
it's simple from ways you can interact
with the world mechanical standpoint
simple games how can you really take
this newest generation into the deeper
gaming which has happened for every
generation so that's solved that's been
solved in the past but that's probably
our biggest challenges because I try to
i like to make very deep experiences
very diverse experiences but it means
you have to handhold people into them in
a way that they're both find compelling
fun early and are not overwhelmed with
the complexity right and then that's the
plays into the sort of the consequence
recovery reward system as well we're
especially if you look at the new around
I was personally I played everquest or
if you die you have to do a corpse run
mmm and that was a big deal
and the sort of death penalty for gains
has lightened lightened considerably how
do you how do you look at how do you
work with that for shroud of the avatar
well we have we you do have to go get
resurrected in ours it's not as bad as
the old EverQuest corpse runs but we
actually are a little bit more you know
you turn into a ghost and you have to go
find a resurrection ankh and then you
become corporeal again and but it's real
it's Ritz it exists but it's fairly
light but but and we think that for the
beginning character sort of needs to be
that light but we're tying with you know
as you pick the more advanced a
character you become and especially the
more kind of pvp oriented you become you
really want those penalties be high yeah
and I think it actually makes the geeks
you know at that point you're an
experienced player you know the game
mechanics you're not gonna be thrown by
it and that that risk reward the risk
part of the risk reward is something you
embrace because it makes you more scared
and so so yeah so we're we're looking at
cranking up the death penalties and even
for episode 2 we're thinking of crank of
them you know you know this is so far
just talk this is not this is not a
decision but you know part of you
something dime at least mash nating on
is the you know should it be permadeath
at some in some cases is that a
consequence that we should allow people
to engage right that would be
interesting even as an opt-in or
something yeah so in our case there's a
there's a there's a plot reason why that
might turn out to be important so we
will leave that for you to discover</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
