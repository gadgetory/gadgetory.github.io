dotnet and once again pax east 2013 we
are at the last day now this is the
final hours of pax east I'm here with
Mark honeck Director of Product
Marketing for PNY and he has some pretty
crazy new GPU video card cooling
technology that he wants to show us
today mark what can you tell us about
your new cooling stuff so what we looked
at is you know some really exciting
technology in the past so we ventured
out and we were the first company to
integrate a fully enclosed liquid-cooled
system into our gtx 680 680 product line
so as you can see here this is kind of
the first example of that this was an
all-in-one fully enclosed liquid-cooled
system this allowed for basically the
CPU to basically stay very very cool
running a very high clock rates without
really having to do any work and
maintaining the quality of the product
but what we've done now is we looked at
this approach and saw the market and
said you know what if we came out with a
modular version that would enable all of
our customers to basically go out there
and and scale to do SLI capability to
add varying radiators to tie in CPU
coolers and also bridge in the GPU
together all in one unit so now I want
to share with you the exciting
developments that we've done so what we
looked at was some server technology
that really helped us to bridge this gap
and this is the quick disconnect system
from our partner a stack and we decided
to go with them and implement this into
a consumer level product so what that
allows us to create now is instead of
shipping a fully enclosed unit with the
radiator included we're now able to
provide basically quick disconnects
running directly out of the graphics
card itself what this allows us to do is
then offer the ability to create modular
capabilities so you could choose between
a small radiator or a larger radiator
adding and bridging in sli into this
configuration and tying in your CPU
cooler as well so how this works is very
simple
all of the liquid is contained within
this individual modular segment as soon
as the connections made that creates the
bridge to pass the cooling across the
board no air bubbles are pushed across
when the connections made and it's
really really easy let me show you how
so all I do is I basically take this end
here and I plug it in I make the turn
and boom it's connected do the same
thing over here
and boom it's connected fully enclosed
fully capable so what this allows is now
a very very simple very rare reliable
DIY modular liquid-cooled setup that's
fully scalable fully customizable and it
even allows you to daisy-chain a number
of different radiators in case you
wanted to increase your configuration so
let me show you how that works real
quick
so basically here what you can see is I
just make the simple disconnect here and
then now i can take basically this
version add another radiator if i wanted
to just plug it in turn it snap it and
do the same thing again
and turn it and snap it and now I've got
two radiators bridged in to the same
card now what you can imagine is we've
also got modular components as well that
will allow to bring three graphics cards
together and in a triple SLI
configuration and then also bridging in
CPU coolers also with the quick
disconnect system so now you have the
capability to make a fully enclosed
liquid-cooled system without all the
hassle the reliability and the issues
that come with custom water blocked
arrangements so we feel really really
excited about this technology and are
going to be bringing this to the market
in the very very near future so another
key advantage here is as we go forward
the Kepler GPU architecture it has a
limitation innately of 50 degrees
Celsius in terms of GPU boost and
maximum performance gangs what this
system does is it works together with
the existing shroud cooler fan to
basically provide a lower 50 degrees
environment running at least 1,250
megahertz clock rate so this will allow
you to basically take this an
overclocked to significantly higher than
any other card out on the market today
very cool any ETA on this so what we're
looking at here is probably right around
the third quarter of this year so it
would be about the July timeframe we're
just finalizing our profiles finishing
our qualifications and then we'll be
bringing this out to market sounds great
what do we have over here for memory so
over here what I'm feature his p.m. wise
accelerate brand of memory modules so
what we have here is our gold series are
black series and in our red series so
our gold series product features
basically industry standard clock rates
or slightly above it so five percent
incremental OC our Black Series
typically will be a ten percent OC
series and our
read which uses a very very high grade
aluminum heat spreader for extreme heat
dissipation is targeted around the ten
to fifteen percent OC range as you can
see here and I'm sure you can play with
it as well you can see it's a very very
robust aluminum heat spreader solution
and we have the unique thin design here
as well which allows for great thermal
dissipation within the system when
running a very high clock rates all of
these support X and V profiles standard
and today we can clock it up to 24
hundred megahertz per second very cool
what else do you have here and also what
we have is our SSD product portfolio so
I'd like to highlight today that here
we're featuring our accelerate consumer
brand of SSDs we have two models our
standard accelerate which runs at 500
megabytes per second read sequential
four hundred fifty megabytes per second
sequential write with 60,000 I ops out
of the box we then have our accelerate
pro product which uses 3k flash perform
program array cycles runs up to five
hundred fifty megabytes per second
sequential read with 520 megabytes per
second sequential write with 85,000 I
ops well we don't have here today is our
basically our flagship product which is
our prevail elite this is actually the
highest life time you get out of any
drive on the SSD market today we
actually took enterprise-grade flash
using the most expensive server drives
and brought that into our into our line
and done it at a very very aggressive
price point what 10k performance or our
program erase cycles gets you is more
than three times the life of any drive
out on the market today so that means
you could write the full capacity of
that drive every day and have it last
for five to seven years
that's that's a pretty long time that's
do you who's your target market for that
drive so what we're looking there is
anybody who's doing very very heavy
video use you know lots of heavy editing
video editing and then also all the way
up to our server class customers as well
so anyone who's really doing lots of
right usage using especially as a
secondary drive or doing lots of heavy
raid especially raid 0 it's an awesome
drive for raid 0 that's some pretty
impressive product so far for the video
cards especially I am really excited
about the modularity for the new GTX 60
rees cards here and thanks got marked
for showing us all these great products
we will see you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
