the EVGA suite now looking at some of
the new video card cooling designs and
we've also got all manner of liquid
coolers on the table to talk about today
including some four CPUs which is a bit
different before getting into that this
coverage is brought to you by cyber
power and there's cyber excel gaming PC
which is a larger PC with an invertible
motherboard layout if you want to learn
more you can hit the link in the
description below so let's start with
the video cards just cuz that's what
pretty much everyone knows from EVGA and
we'll get to the coolers next this is
one of the gtx ten series cars 1070 1080
doesn't matter they're all the same sort
of ID right now but the difference is
instead of a CX this is an eye CX cooler
that's new we'll have more detail in the
future I have some basics that I can
tell you just from looking at it and
observing but they can't really tell me
a whole lot in terms of functionality
and stuff under the cooler and I did ask
and we were know how to take it apart so
the cooler has a first off fairly
functional backplate in theory in that
it's all ventilated so that should be
good with keeping the back side of the
PCB warm we did or cool because we did
some testing and saw it was a bit warm
and some of our benchmarks depending on
the thermal pad layout speaking of
thermal pads these coolers do have just
from looking at it down the side I can
see their own pads on the B rammed the
vrm components including the MOSFETs and
the capacitor banks and the chokes have
direct contact to the base plate so that
should all be resolved with IC x cooler
this is going to exist side by side with
a CX at least for now but they will be
at different price points so part of the
the price point is going to be because
this is a bit more advanced in terms of
the base plate and things like that if
you look at the base plate that has some
really fine tiny fins off to the left
bottom left corner from my perspective
which would be just southwest of the GPU
basically those are supposed to help
with dissipation by adding some surface
area pretty basic design and then in the
middle there's more of that and if we
look really closely you can see there's
a protrusion from the base plate it's a
little and either aluminum or a nickel
plated copper going just off of
that protrudes down and contacts the
vram and that is a bit unique because
you don't really generally see the
baseplate and the GP cooler for most of
these vendors cooling the vram actively
by contact at best it's the thermal pad
but that's not really that common so
that will make the as we've shown before
make the GPU diode temperatures look a
bit higher because it's cooling multiple
devices but overall your experience is
better because the GPU diode temperature
only needs to be so low before you're
concerned about other things so that's
the icx cooler I think I got most of it
six heat pipes something like that look
at that more hopefully end of January
other stuff on the video card front
there's a new hybrid with quick release
so it's a qrg hybrid and we talked about
these last year at CES same idea where
there's quick release valves you take
the orange cap off and you can connect
whatever you want to it so that would
generally be something like a radiator
for cooling the CPU and then you create
kind of a semi custom loop rather than
the usual CLC and then for CLC's we've
got this as the name plate says
closed-loop CPU cooler it is not
labeling what type of product it is that
is the actual name so this is the EVGA
closed-loop liquid cooler the it's got
some features that are comparable in
some way to the kraken series that we
tore down and basically the it's a Gen 5
vasotec pump same as the Krakens x 42 X
50 X 62 the pump plate the top is RGB
illuminated it should in the near future
before launch be able to support
actually configuring the RGB LEDs and
then disconnecting the cable while
saving your settings so that should be
possible with a firmware update for
radiator size they are in - 80 and 120
millimeter options prices are not final
yet this should be below 140 from what
I'm told
but TBD so big asterisk there the 120
should be somewhere below 100 maybe 90
ish also TBD the fans have a sort of
unique design it's hard to say with fans
really how much the design matters when
you're talking about the fan blade
layout and
the chassis around it because this
chassis does come up a bit it's supposed
to reduce the noise emissions we'll have
to test it to really know but that's the
marketing language behind it the
radiators are aluminum and the cold
plate is copper it is not a protruded
copper cold plate like EVGA normally
makes this is meant for CPU cooling you
use this one standalone or you buy one
of these options to hook it into the
rest of the system I think that covers
most of the basics there's some software
for the AIO that we were able to get a
few photos of you can see that they're
currently it shows the liquid the actual
coolant temperature in theory anyway and
it's also got some RGB controls in there
fan speed controls based on the coolant
temperature which is a bit odd but we've
given feedback on that so maybe that
will change and then for the sensor
itself the thermocouple inside of the
chassis if it's anything like the X 42 +
theory it's just a thermocouple that
sticks straight down into the liquid
tank and it's got a bunch of thermal
compound around it and that would give
you your liquid temperature measurement
if it's not contacting something else
instead but we'll tear it down and see
how it's built so I think that covers it
there's a new case as well to dg7 cases
a mid tower ATX supports up to 7 fans
you can learn mostly just by looking at
the case honestly - SSDs on the back -
hard drives on the back four total for
each and otherwise it's a it's a mid
tower case so that is EVGA sweet if you
are curious to learn more links in the

you all next time
