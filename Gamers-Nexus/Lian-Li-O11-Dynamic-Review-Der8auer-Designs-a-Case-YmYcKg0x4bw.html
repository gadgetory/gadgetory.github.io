mostly designed a case this one is that
it has holes everywhere one mr. dare
Bauer designed this case in conjunction
with Lian Li we looked at it at CES 2018
and we're actually very impressed with
it I think we gave it one of our awards
for the show so this is the Leon leo 11
dynamic it also has an 11 air coming out
in May or June and the dynamic is where
we're starting today for a review and we
were able to air cool it anyway so we're
gonna look at this one and see how an
extreme overclockers case holds up to
our thermal battery before that this
video is brought to you by the EVGA z10
mechanical keyboard the EVGA z10
includes a small display readout top and
center capable of providing Hardware
monitoring information and EVGA
precision statistics the board comes
with either kale brown or blue switches
offers a column of programmable macro
keys a volume slider a dimmer and a
detachable wrist rest
learn more at the link in the
description below quick note getting
started into this all of our lights are
plugged into a battery back and right
now because the electricity is out so
the lighting may be a little bit
different from Norley but whatever point
it is we're looking at the OLF and
dynamic today though all of an error is
the one that I'm really interested in it
has a mesh or a grille rather in the
front and I believe the top that we saw
at CES 2018 this is more meant for water
cooling build so it's called the dynamic
that comes to 0 fans it's a $130 MSRP
it's $100 pre-order by the time this
goes live pre-orders over so it's $130
case made by Lian Li which for them is
quite cheap in cooperation with their
Bauer and extreme overclocker
who put in a lot of the legwork
designing the case there are some pretty
good features on it that we'll get to
first off though for cooling support so
up front of it's glass sides glass
fortunately there are still holes in the
case the bottom has support for three
120 millimeter fans they only sent nine
of them I guess just to make sure we
used fans and didn't test it stock with
no fans and the left side here has space
for a 360 radiator as well or 3 120
millimeter fans top has space for 3
120mm fans as well the back cannot
support a fan
you could get an 80 mil in there if you
wanted to and kind of forcefully mount
it but basically it's up to your own
decisions to figure out how you're gonna
cool the thing we tested a few different
configurations one of them was all three
fans on the bottom we budgeted it
ourselves to three fans for all the
thermal testing because basically we
looked at it as well
it's $130 case maybe you buy a minimum
of 30 dollars worth of fans if you're
spending this kind of money on a case so
if you do that puts you at about 3 fans
for kind of the mid-range to cheap stuff
so we went with 3 fans for our budget
for thermal testing because unreasonable
to ask everything tried three in the
bottom three in the side we tried two in
the bottom one at the top all intake we
tried one on the bottom on the side in
tank and then one of the top exhaust
lots of different things this case is
actually really cool from a not
necessarily thermally but from a test
perspective because it gave us some
unique insights that we don't normally
see with other cases but let's go
through the build quality in the feature
set one of the first things we noticed
is that when you remove the top panel
here which is two screws as usually for
a panel what you end up with is just a
simple press to get the glass out this
actually really cool and it's kind of
sad that it's really cool because so
many companies can't figure out how to
mount tempered glass in a way that's not
ugly or really poorly designed from a UX
UI UX I guess scenario so glass is super
easy to remove that's really nice they
use basically just studs that mount into
a socket so it's a round peg that goes
into a socket same is true for this
panel and for the front panel as well so
you just kind of push it comes off no
screws and it's not like that's gonna
make sure cooling better or anything but
functionally it's really well designed
build quality's good and they clearly
thought it out pretty well there are a
few things where you can see decision
points in the case - for example in the
back Leoni is a couple of millimeters
away from being able to support a 120
millimeter fan so you know hopefully
anyway at some point in the design
process someone said
make this thing a little wider in
support of 120 and ultimately they
decided no they wanted a specific size
semi compact case without getting into
the ultra wide Corsair style double-wide
trailer case that we've seen in the past
so that's what they went with their four
other features I guess I'll pop the
glass off here just to show that's the
same mechanism so my only complaint with
all the popping panels is that with the
glass it's impossible to do without
getting smudges on it I don't know that
there's a better solution to that but be
prepared to clean it off all right so
that's the bare case internally what we
have is a standard layout at sports ATX
motherboards and water cooling obviously
so you can kind of mount the radiators
wherever you want for the things like
cable management this motherboard tray
comes out really far it's it's super
deep but the reason is because there are
two power supply mounts behind the
motherboard tray so it's
compartmentalized and the second power
supply mount does not have to be used
we're not using it presently it's
basically there in case you for some
reason maybe you're pushing enough
current that you need to power supplies
pretty rare use case exceptionally rare
because you can't put two computers in
here so it would just be if you need two
power supplies for one computer which
sounds like the kind of thing they're
Bauer would need so I was like the kind
of thing he said no guys I promise
people really want this because he
really wants it so anyway you're
probably going to use it
alternatively it does have a drive cage
instead for the second power spot you
can pull that move it into either cage
power supply slot and then put the power
supply whichever one you want
well designed there and one of the
features that although probably unused
in 99% of use cases is a unique one
there's a giant tail management bar on
the back now technically they have cable
tie-down points all over the backside
you could properly route and tie down
the cables in the back or we just smash
it all down with kale management bar so
that was well done and implemented the
fan options we liked a lot and had
pretty unique cooling performance as
noted but it does come down to the air
for what we want to see on the benches
visually this one is one of the better
tempered glass implementation
we've seen they've managed to put the
glass on without screws sticking out
they've managed to do it without really
annoying tool requirements like flathead
screwdrivers and allen keys Corsair and
Coolermaster and also the fact that they
come to a sort of flush finish at the
end makes it look more like a showroom
case actually we think it looks better
in this stock configuration than it did
at CES with their case mod configuration
it was a very cool mod props to the
person who made it but the stock
configuration looks good on its own
because it shows off the components so
well so other notes vertical GPU
placement is something we noticed as
soon as we saw the case there are
multiple slots for the vertically
oriented GPU its we mounted and all of
them are set well away from the glass
unlike other cases that tend to
suffocate air-cooled GPUs by smashing
them against the side panel the
balancing key that shipped with our case
is slightly different than the one
depicted in the instruction manual it
seems like one that Liana is trying to
use for future case designs so they can
reduce their tooling cost later the
expansion slot nearest the motherboard
is impossible to use with an ATX board
because of clearance issues and there
are mounting holes for the riser cable
that don't correspond to any PCIe slots
they're too far forward towards the
class still we didn't have any problems
fitting our extra wide em aside ten
eighty in there and the two PCIe slots
nearest the glass the ones we use for
testing still offer much more GPU
clearance than other cases we've seen
well put the test bench up on the screen
briefly this is what we use for
standardized airflow testing and
thermals the case is meant for liquid
cooling but it still is something you
could easily buy for an air-cooled case
it's got plenty of fan mounting points
it doesn't have to be used for water
cooling just because it has glass in
fact most of the other cases on the
market would indicate that anyway so we
have plenty of site intake options we
have plenty of bottom top and take up or
exhaust options which makes it pretty
unique to test our configurations for
this would be first of all we use the
fans Leon Lee sent three of these we
figured probably people will be buying
these and to be fair it's what they're
sending out with the air later anyways
this gives us some early insight and
will make it easier for us to compare
this case versus the air version of the
case later so we use these fans we put
three in the side intake
all three of them blow air straight in
they hit the glass make a u-turn
basically you lose some pressure every
time you make a 90-degree turn you lose
about 30% of your pressure so the air
comes in makes a turn and it gets pulled
through the CPU tower gets pulled
through the video card there's not a lot
of place for it to exhaust except
naturally based on just air pressure you
end up with a positive intake pressure
so that would dictate that the air finds
its way out through gaps naturally that
would be gaps on the bottom the back and
the top our other configuration was
three fans in the bottom blowing
straight up those are largely obstructed
by the video card and so the CPU would
perform worse in that scenario and then
finally or actually the two final ones
we had two in the bottom both pushing
straight up into the GPU removing the
one that was pushing air into the rest
of the cabin and then we had one in the
top right in front of CPU as intake
pulling air down and then after that we
did one more with a side intake a bottom
intake and a top exhaust because it's
any case so we wanted to test all of
those let's get into the thermal and
noise numbers next and then talk about
the results one more note for the
thermal testing before we get into it
these fans spin really fast 1900 rpm
which puts us at total system noise of
48 DBA when everything's going and
because of that it's quite a bit louder
than everything else on the chart even
though we always test everything with
max fan speeds unless otherwise stated
so we did 100% speeds for comparative
numbers with the LIA mio 11 dynamic by
itself and then we did a 40 dB a noise
normalized set of numbers for something
that's toward the top end in terms of
noise of all the other cases this gives
us more comparative data because it sort
of levels the playing field in terms of
noise or loudness as opposed to just
blasting out the loudest possible
configuration and instantly winning all
charts starting with standalone torture
thermals on the CPU the Leon leo 11
dynamic configured for air cooling posts
a wide range of results from 49 degrees
to 67 degrees Celsius over ambient
except for 40 DBA testing all the other
tests were at 100% fan speeds strictly
for fan placement comparisons we found
that the three outside panel intake fans
perform the best with a forty nine
degree over ambient CPU results which is
closest file
by side intake fans at 40 DB a
significantly slower and quieter 65% PWM
so that was running at 54 degrees
configuring one top exhaust behind the
CPU one bottom intake below the GPU core
and on one side and take near the tower
cooler we operated that 58 degrees over
ambiens about four degrees warmer than
the muted side intake configuration at
40 DBA
going on with full bottom intake was
worse for the CPU as all the air gets
shoved into the GPU and the only output
is warmed air and radiative heat into
the tower cooler going with to bottom
intake and one top intake proves the
worst results of a complete lack of any
exhaust options outside of some air
recirculating and eventually drafting
outward so that's what's going on here
if you're curious it's because of the
way the GPU with an open phase cooler
has nowhere to send its air because
relatively close to the glass close
enough that the PCIe cables are in fact
touching the glass because it's a
plus-size PCB and so what happens is a
lot of that air gets stuck in the bottom
compartment and some of it eventually
drafts up and gets pulled through the
CPU that's why you see the performance
we see where these sight intakes do the
best because there's a clear path in and
out of the case and that is just a
complete positive pressure from the
front air flow that forces air out all
the cracks that can find like the bottom
of the case for the GPU when it's
pushing air out of the cooler
comparatively and focusing primarily on
40 DBA testing the Leon leo 11 dynamic
performed marginally above average with
full side intake testing at 54 degrees
Celsius over ambient this is
functionally equal to the measure of icy
stock dark base 700 p.m. o2 and eight
700 I there's nothing special about with
this performance metric aside from the
fact that we still have Headroom to cool
better of course louder fans this point
is indicated by the 100% fan speed test
all 48 DBA of it at 49 degrees Celsius
over ambient brute-forcing doesn't get
us to the top of the chart still despite
burning out about 8 DBA over the next
grouping of loud cases but this case is
also meant for water cooling it's when
Leon Lee ships their air version of the
O 11 that will focus on air cooling even
more and was originally suggested as
shipping with six 120 fans
not sure if that speck stayed though the
case can be made to perform reasonably
well for the dynamic and that's a pretty
strong point for it for something that
is showy and liquid quilling focused it
can still cool really well from an air
flow standpoint you'll just have to add
fans carefully and in the right
positions looking at GPU thermals first
against itself the Leon leo 11 posted a
range of 48 to 57 degrees above ambient
with the three side intake fans again
performed best at forty eight point one
degrees the muffled side intake operated
next best at 51 degrees with a three
bottom intake fans performing shockingly
poorly after further inspection we
realized that this was for two reasons
one there's limited distance between the
bottom of the case and the desk
resulting in a heavier requirement for a
high static pressure and overall reduced
access to air to the GPU may take air in
but it's having trouble again pushing
there out with this configuration the
GPU horizontally blocks most airflow
upwards as well so it becomes something
of a closed loop that can recirculate
air it's like a firewall you ideally
want some exhaust or direct ventilation
from elsewhere in the case our custom
configurations performed worst with the
two bottom and one intake top setup
operating at 57 degrees over ambient
comparatively the Leon leo 11 dynamic
ends up between the coarser 570 X at
1550 rpm the view 71 and the venerable
Silverstone are l06 not a bad place to
be this positioning is at 40 DBA for the
Leon E case which is also roughly the
same noise levels the RL 0 6 and the
throne take view 37 these three cases
are functioning oice normalized and have
nearly equivalent performance going to
100% fan speed and 48 DBA gots us most
the way to the top but not quite all the
way up there the case does fine and it
isn't overwhelming in any capacity of
the word when it configured with three
well-placed intake fans but it's doing
ok
with the baseline 40 DB a side intake
configuration moving on to 3d mark
firestrike extreme now the GPU hit 53
degrees Celsius delta T / ambiens in our
FS e test that's again roughly
equivalent to the view 37 as well as the
h5 under B mesh that's among the best
scores on our chart for this one
especially for modern cases temperatures
while rendering with
on the CPU mirrored the results of the
CV torture test thirty-eight point three
degrees Celsius and it's smack in the
middle of the chart again liquid cooling
or cranking up the fans would improve
this number but this degree of CPU
cooling is fine for daily use GPU
accelerated around Raiden brought the
GPU to twenty-five point two degrees
Celsius delta T putting it in a
favorable position between the age 700 I
and the RV zero - it's not the best
score on the chart but it's oddly good
considering that there's no fan pointed
directly into the GPU as there isn't a
half X for example we'd initially Peg's
the side intake fan slots as a way to
show off a fancy radiator but it seems
like they can also do a great job in
terms of actual functional cooling the
stock will have been dynamic in terms of
noise levels now has no offense so in a
way it's completely silent aside from
system noise that put it around with the
in wind 303 is when it has zero fans
you're looking at system noise and the
ability to contain it and how well
that's done but we did use three fans
for the Leon Lee review as they supply
them and these are probably the same
fans that'll be used in the Leon leo
Levin air later on
normally we keep fan speeds maxed out
for noise test but those are at 48 DBA
because it's 1900 rpm which is
absolutely blows away everything else on
the chart
other than the PMO want the noise
normalized tests offer decent
performance at 40 DBA which is loud to
average for the cases we've tested
depending on how you feel subjectively
about that the 11 dynamic is different
that's great there are tons of
manufacturers playing it safe at every
price point with samey cases but Leon
Lee has avoided falling into that rut
for better or for worse performance is
much better than we thought it would be
especially for a water cooling case and
the case is well suited for liquid
cooling radiators and open loops if
that's what you prefer
the vertical GPU mount typically a weak
point for cooling performance was
handled excellently we're looking
forward to the release of the mesh front
at 11 air later which will be better
suited for our test bench and its price
we're not final on but originally at CES
what we're told is between 140 and a
hundred and sixty dollars we're also
told that come with six fans which is a
hell of a lot of fans so we'll see if
that holds true even with three though
it's shaping out to be a really
interesting case to test from a feature
standpoint
the O 11 dynamic has a lot of cool stuff
just in terms of being well designed
that we don't see on a lot of other
modern cases we can think probably dare
Bauer for a lot of that he's a proper
enthusiast and he frankly isn't someone
who designs products all day so he's not
going to be blinded by things like
keeping costs down or worrying about moq
or bomb or any of those other aspects of
product manufacturing he's gonna put
forward the specs and I'm Leon Lee will
take care of it hopefully and it came
out really well so a backside has some
interesting features that we went over
earlier with the kale management bar
that's well positioned it's got two
power supply it mounts although we don't
suspect anyone will really use those for
the most part it's a unique feature and
cooling has enough ventilation options
that if you work on it and you put some
time into it you can come out with a
really well ventilated system we would
suggest side mounts as intake here
actually we thought that would be one of
the worst performing ones but it worked
pretty well and we'll talk about this
more with the air version of the case
later at 130 dollars it's extremely
competitive at the hundred dollar
pre-order price it's an easy purchase
for the build quality it's superb you do
obviously lack the included fans but you
can make that up easily and at a hundred
dollar pre-order 130 even for the retail
price those are both pretty good price
points a couple of notes for competition
the if they don't take vo 71 that we
actually liked a lot more than we
thought we would is presently $125 after
sales and rebates that's a really good
case for the price at 125 bucks so
that's a direct competitor in terms of
using it for liquid cooling and price
not for form factor so keep that in mind
other alternatives if you want to look
at them and the 150 range the H 500
people e near there depending on what
sales are going on we've liked the mesh
a lot more than the H 500 P and M zxe
has a couple of options as well so
that's primarily what we're looking at
for immediate competition with the Lian
