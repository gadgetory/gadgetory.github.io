technology are often the most
interesting for their reduction in power
consumption which grants more battery
life so you go from Pascal to Maxwell
because of the reduction in power
consumption on the GPU there is a
benefit to the battery life and the same
is true for Intel and moving from as
well the skylake to kb lake or whatever
now kb lake I would say don't really
hold your breath for that but we're
still waiting on the arrival of those
chips before getting to the coverage of
the Apache laptop this content is
brought to you by an tech and a new cube
MITx case designed by Razer which
supports a full open-loop liquid cooling
solution surprisingly for being a small
box and you can hit the link in the
description below for more information
as for what we're looking at today this
is the ge62 apache pro laptop from msi
this one has the GTX 1060 in it I've got
another ge62 Apache pro next to me and
we already did a video talking about
their naming scheme if the names confuse
you
this one is with a 970m this is the
previous generation this is the new
generation and that's what we're
reviewing today MSI is a patchy pro that
we're looking at today the ge62 VR is
priced at $1600 the ge62 VR is part of
the again Apache family of MSI notebooks
with the six in the sixty two indicating
a 15.6 inch display and the two
indicating a second-generation chassis
the unit's crowning feature is its GTX
1060 desktop GPU which runs a full 10
SMS per 1280 CUDA cores and this is
identical to the GTX 1060 add-in boards
for desktops with the only difference
being clock rate and some power
management stuff 10 series notebooks
have about a 10 percent range permitted
for pre overclock or under clock
settings on the GPU as defined by the
manufacturer and that's likely to be the
largest contributor to FPS differences
between laptops this generation that is
aside from the bloatware that we already
talked about on the MSI notebooks if you
want to see that video we already posted
one but bloatware aside the GTX 1060
runs at 16 70 megahertz stock and runs
the
same eight gigabit per second six
gigabytes of gddr5 as a desktop
counterpart as for the CPU msi ge62 VR
is using a six gen i7 6700 HQ clocked at
2.6 gigahertz pre boost and this is the
non overclocking skew of current skylake
notebook CPUs kb lake will undoubtedly
see inclusion in notebooks soon and they
will be Pascal and Polaris hopefully in
some regard though its performance
difference will almost certainly be
negligible for gaming this time our unit
uses 16 gigabytes of ddr4 so-dimm memory
with a maximum support capacity of 32
gigabytes for higher density modules
ddr4 is lower power consumption than
ddr3 so that is more benefit to the
battery life in theory and there's also
an nvme MDOT - SSD included at 240
gigabytes also a low power consumption
part with a one terabyte SATA hard drive
for mass storage not quite as low power
consumption but we're moving away from
them eventually the ge62 VR uses either
a 15.6 inch 1080p display or 15.6 inch
4k display both IPS panels with accurate
color from most viewing angles and our
test model is one with a 1080p display
but we connected a monitor for
additional 1440p testing it's a shame
that the laptop doesn't have a 1440p
option natively from the manufacturer
since the 1060 can definitely handle
1440p gaming and it does struggle with
4k making the pairing a bit less
sensical
you'd have to buy a 4k display just to
run games at 1440p because there is a
note native option for just a 1440p
display before getting to the benchmark
so let's look at the internals of this
notebook the bottom of the laptop uses
four quadrants of ventilation ports over
the memory and some of the heat pipes
with two side ventilation ports still on
the bottom for fans there are also side
ventilation ports and ports elsewhere on
the laptop like the back as for internal
cooling a set of heat pipes converge on
the CPU and GPU aluminum cold plates
fairly standard for laptop cooling and
they don't really create the most
comprehensive coverage we've seen in a
laptop like msi gt80 3 Titan
but this is way smaller and it's got to
keep weight in mind as well so copper
obviously adds a ton of weight so the
thermal coverage looks good from the
design but we can actually test it and
see what it looks like in actuality
that's what we're going to do next but
the first thing to talk about testing
methodology all that stuff is defined in
the article below if you're curious
about how we run these tests or you want
to recreate some of the testing yourself
to make sure your unit is within the
spec that we've sort of laid out and we
also have some noise tests in the
article which are important this time
around because the fan RPMs are a bit
more variable than we've seen in the
past so that will be in the article here
we're talking about thermals bloatware
fps and battery life for thermals we're
looking at delta T values by subtracting
the ambient temperature as collected by
two thermocouples which are then
averaged for the room temperature the
msi ge62 VR keeps its CPU at a
temperature of approximately twenty six
point eight C delta T over ambiens a
slight improvement from the previous
ge62 model that we tested with his
twenty seven point nine four C
temperature idle is about the same
between the two and the fanbook four is
large form factor benefits the unit's
ability to dissipate heat a bit better
allowing it to skate by just below the
i7 6700 HQ equipped ge62 VR for GPU
thermals we're at 31 C delta T over
ambient load on the msi ge62 VR or about
four C improved over the gtx 960m at GE
62 unit that we previously reviewed
thermal values are vastly improved over
the nine atm note though that MSI is
mostly able to achieve its lower
temperature by blasting the fan rpm
which gets pretty loud when under full
load and again you can check our article
for fan noise and DB testing and our
usual endurance test with two hours of
gaming on the AC is also in the article
going into the FPS test we already
posted a video and an article on the
bloatware that comes pre-installed in
these units if you don't want to use the
word bloatware I guess to define it was
more than I think 13 programs included
all that start at startup when you first
get the unit that includes Norton the
MSI control panel the dragon center
stuff all the lighting for the keyboard
steelseries keyboard tons of stuff lots
of software killer networking all this
stuff so we tested it
and the impact unfortunately for a
messiah was pretty significant it was
somewhere in the range of 12 to 20% at
worst and to give an example well we'll
go through the numbers again here but
this is where an SI actually has some
value like high-power CyberPower
origin those three companies for sure
generally don't include the kind of
bloat that you will find straight from
manufacturer and they're taking these
units and rebranding them and selling
them so it's the same laptop but the
reason it's unfortunate is because from
a hardware perspective this is mostly
identical as one would expect because
the CPU and the GPU are made by Intel
and NVIDIA they don't change mostly
identical to the competitors but it will
look a lot worse in benchmarks if you
don't remove all the bloatware first or
if you're maybe working with the user
who doesn't know to do that and so the
difference looks larger than it actually
is from a hardware level so just to
quickly recap those performance metrics
GTA 5 so our performance reduction of
about 19 FPS average at 1080p ultra when
using bloatware on this ge62 VR after we
uninstalled the software we were over
100 FPS average and running 0.1% low
values of 70 FPS compared to the 50 2.7
FPS of the bloated system Metro last
light posted similar results with nearly
76 FPS average on a clean install versus
59 FPS on the creep software bloated
install the hit 20.1% loads is also
substantial and Metro last light gapped
at about a 2x difference and that's just
a few of the more CPU bound tests you
can read or view that content for more
depth but let's look at the comparative
tests with no bloatware installed on any
systems for the best Hardware comparison
this generation and that starts with
shadow of mordor which is our more
complete comparative chart because we
were able to run these tests on the 1070
1018 notebooks while at Nvidia's press
event haven't received those yet for
review but we ran these tests they're at
1080p ultra with shadow of mordor the
ge62 vr and it's GTX 1060 s sit between
the 980 m and 1070 notebooks we're at 70
6.3 FPS average and 51.7 fps 1% low but
resting near 37 FPS for the 0.1% low
values
980m meanwhile is pushing an FPS average
of 60 4.3 with 47 1% lows and 43 0.1%
lows as for the 10 17 notebooks
that's posting a significantly higher
FPS than really both of these at 114
average with lows constantly above 60
the cleveo 1080 equipped notebook for
reference is nearly a hundred and forty
FPS average at 1080p clearly far and
away better equipped than the other two
and more suited for higher resolution
gaming at 1440p more places the 10 60
exactly where it did hierarchically as
at 1080p performance rest around 60fps
marking the 10 60 with i7 6700 HQ combo
powerful enough to support shadow of
Mordor at 1440p with ultra settings the
1080 laptop unit for reference is closer
to 100 FPS while the 1070 unit is at 70
FPS average looking at 1440p performance
for the GTX 1060 across-the-board just
looking at this one laptop here we're
seeing greater than 60 fps and almost
all of the games tested Metro last light
is the only title where performance
falls below 60 fps and it's still plenty
playable at 52 FPS average overwatch as
one might expect runs easily and at
nearly 100 FPS average with lows greater
than 70 FPS GTA 5 is nearly maxed out
other than advanced graphics and runs at
75 FPS average for 1440p but our unit
has a 1080p display so this was all done
with the laptop effectively docked and
plugged into a monitor the point is that
a 1440p display on a gtx 1060 laptop
would actually not be misplaced if you
could find one but there's not one on
the msi ge62 VR that we've yet seen
1080p gaming is relatively painless for
the laptop across the board we're
getting 109 FPS average in black ops 3
at 1080p high with the 970 m unit at 62
FPS average that's a massive 50 FPS gain
over the last gen step higher GPU skew
but also the CPU has changed and that's
important to Metro last light operates
at 76 FPS average on the ge62 VR with a
970 m ge62 version from last gen at 4
seven FPS overwatch would be supported
on 120 Hertz displays readily which this
doesn't have but MSI does have a few in
the works and maybe some even shipping
at this point and 148 FPS average is
what is pushed for overwatch on the 1060
notebook also supporting a 98 fps 0.1%
low value the ge62 970m is at 89 FPS
average granting a sizable lead to the
new generation of non-m branded GPUs
because again this is a desktop 1060
using grid Autosport four hour battery
life test we start the test at 1080p
ultra with loop enabled then check Event
Viewer defined kernel power events at
the end of the test the ge62 survives
for 68 minutes of gaming compared to the
960m Apache pro at 51 minutes and these
units were pretty similar in spec given
the generational gap the power
consumption overall has been reduced
across basically all components in the
system including the GPU the CPU and the
memory the nine ATM units have the best
battery life presently on our bench but
that's for two reasons one the test when
on battery is limited to 30 fps with
battery boost 1.0 that is a power saving
feature but 2.0 which is supported with
the 1060 allows you to get up to 60 fps
if you enable it and as a part of that
point the 980m can handle 30 FPS
relatively easily comparatively and it's
just not sucking all the power it's
rated for because it's a more powerful
system it's limited to 30 FPS so you get
better battery now the main thing here
though is that the fan book is
physically imposing and has a massive
battery as a result of its 18 inch form
factor and this helps considerably
because the battery is just physically
larger msi ge62 VR is priced at $1,600
that lands it basically actually exactly
the same price as most of its
competitors including the Asus
equivalent size gtx 1060 notebook the
ROG Strix gigabytes p at 55 w notebook
also $1600 acer not a soos acer is $100
more at 1700 but we don't have full
specs on there 15.6 inch predator just
yet so in terms of price they're all
pretty much the same Asus is the most
competitive in thickness and they've got
a slight difference in weight and height
extra features but the biggest
difference is in the bloatware if you're
savvy enough to remove unneeded
applications when you get the system or
reinstall windows msi ge62 VR hardware
is good and the chassis z' of reasonable
build quality now the best we've seen
but pretty darn good and the form factor
is small enough to use on a plane so the
main thing here the takeaway is you're
obviously sacrificing a bit rather than
going with something like a blade which
generally will run more expensive but is
a bit smaller you get a slightly larger
form factor laptop you can see we're not
at the sort of Ultrabook form factor
which is not really terminology used
anymore but the less than one inch form
factor is not what you'll get here you
would need something like a stealth
for I'm from an aside for that or a
blade from Razer both of which are more
expensive part four part so that's the
this is the middle ground unit other
than some of the gt72 Dominator stuff we
might look at later and as far as travel
goes it is something you could actually
use on a plane a decent for gaming but
lower price overall than these smaller
competitors as for software that the out
of box software is really killing
performance and makes this thing look
way worse than it actually is and not
only look worse when using it you can
actually feel these differences and see
them clicking on something as simple as
advanced power options after hitting the
system tray battery icon that takes
sometimes more than one full second to
open and that might sound petty
but when you're looking at equivalent
Hardware for the same price doing it
instantly it's a big difference so this
is a big issue for MSI I really hope
that they will sort of tone down the
bloat that they've got on their systems
Norton's a big part of that their own
control panel which I know they will
defend as being sort of a ease-of-use
feature for people who don't know how to
use the normal windows control panel to
do the same things that does add some
bloat a lot of its Norton if you don't
tune it you can obviously tune it a bit
but that's the arguments the same if
it's people who don't know what they're
doing it's just going to perform slower
than it needs to and those aren't the
only two culprits either all this other
stuff there's like 13
in software solutions on I that don't
need to be on there and as for the VR
tag ge62 VR that's the thing now so
we've got even things like the s340
elite which is a good-looking case it's
still kind of taking some of that VR
branding so it's a big thing right now
I'm not sure that this is the SKU I
would get for VR gaming you could
certainly do some VR on it but for
higher graphics settings more complex
games in the future things like that
a 1060 is a bit low on the the list I
would probably look towards a 1070 maybe
a case Q CPU but this HQ CPU with 1060
is definitely cutting it close depending
on what kind of VR games are planning to
play and then of course there's Andy's
new rx 470 laptop this was announced
somewhat silently while we were at PAX
we went to their booth we're like where
is this thing and they couldn't get us
one while at the show we haven't seen
one I haven't been able to acquire one
from anybody so hopefully we can look at
the RX 470 lat op soon because that
would be a good competitive look but
right now it's all just Nvidia stuff
that we have because AMD has been kind
of out of the laptop game for a while
and the RX Polaris stuff is the most
recent to go hopefully into laptops but
it's just begun with rx 470 and it's
impossible to find at least on the
review side so I don't have one for you
yet unfortunately but hopefully we will
get one at some point for now this is
what we've got
