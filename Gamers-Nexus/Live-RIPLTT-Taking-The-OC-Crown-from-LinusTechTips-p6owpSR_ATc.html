let me know in chat as soon as you can
see us and hear us we should be good on
audio and video and stuff like that but
let me know so I'm still waiting for the
video to pop up on my own hopefully it's
going through if it is we are going to
be doing a live overclock it looks like
it's going now going to be doing a live
overclock of the Titan V and the 79 to
80 XE the goal here is to beat Linus's
score or his team's score they recently
just they did that singularity PC I
think and they had I don't even know I
think was a Titan V 128 gig of ram 79 AD
XE and basically they passed our rank on
the 3d mark Hall of Fame which is not
okay so we're gonna take that back I
actually I think let me check on their
score right now you know where they are
and when we're trying to hit previously
I was using Hardware bots and they were
using they were just using the time spy
extreme
Hall of Fame that's built in with future
mark so let's do a lioness and team guy
and they did by the way they did a great
job this is just like a friendly media
battle basically it's a little fun for
everyone
Linus got a we can actually we can show
this screen for a second all full screen
that are you able to see from that angle
so I don't know if you guys can see from
that angle but Linus got a 80 92 for his
score this is times by extreme and we
are down at 11th place we ran this test
last when the Titan view was closer to
launch was newer so I think we can take
that we can definitely get up close to
it we're gonna be fighting over like
single-digit points towards the end but
let's look at their score
and so they did 77 31 GPU and 11,000 CPU
and that's what we're gonna try and beat
today so that's that's what we're
shooting for I'm gonna check chat make
sure everything looks good and then we
can start doing some overclocking by the
way we're a bit late because I tripped
the breaker so overclocking and and
tripped the breaker because we had the
streaming PC which is below this desk
running on the same circuit and it's
thread Ripper machine as the benchmark
machine and the benchmark machine was
only doing like a thousand watts
and the the streaming one was doing a
couple hundred Watts the lights are
doing some wattage so we tripped the
breaker sorry but we're here now I
actually have the stream in PC hooked up
to an extension cable it's running into
the bathroom so that pretty much solves
our problems and we are not overclocking
vacuums today I'm sorry alright so you
don't really first I guess we can go
over the bench I'll show you what's
what's in it for as best as I can anyway
let me try and scoop by do you want this
light pointed at the bench
okay so this is really not meant to be
films but we're gonna try yeah so bench
I'll just point it out from off camera I
guess careful cameras go in handheld all
right so this is kind of crazy right now
basically we have an ek waterblock
setup on the Titan B and hopefully
everything's good because I can't really
see chat from here so this they just
sent me all this stuff I don't even have
the stickers peeled off ek pumping
reservoir going into the Titan V and
then into a 360 radiator on which I have
mounted a I don't even know it's all
kinds of fans we have a soon on maglev
fan here we have a Vardar fan here we
have a Corsair maglev fan here same
thing basically a little slower this
one's only at 80% so we have some
Headroom there over on this one
obviously fans aren't at max speed right
now
maglev maglev non LED maglev and those
are on a 360 thermal take flow radiator
which is going to the CPU so there's
separate loops one's an AI ones a CLC
and one's an open-loop basically and
that more or less covers up us the VR M
is being cooled by the two EVGA fans on
the X 299 dark for the memory we have
Trident Z it is 3600 megahertz
I think CL I don't know 18 or something
I can't remember but that's g.skill
memory 798 exe x-29 dark we have a
noctua nfa 14 right here that's just
blowing down to make sure the V RMS are
cooled in case anything's got loose
contact and I think that covers most of
it except the power supply power supply
is a Corsair a X 1600 i and it's one of
the best power supplies you can get
right now so ax 1600 I for that and this
is also why we trip the breaker earlier
but that was my fault
so okay hopefully Chad's good
we're gonna remount the camera give it a
second so hopefully the pump was pulled
from eight dice that would be much
better all right so that's that's all
the basics hopefully enough people are
in here now it gets started but if you
have questions about the setup spam chat
someone will let you know where I'll see
it at some point and I'm just waiting
for Andrew to finalize the lighting
setup and we'll be good to go
but yeah that's what we're gonna be
testing so what CP is easy I just said
it I just said what CPU were using it's
a 79 80 XE so yeah basically yeah one
quick thing before this I was talking
with build Zoid and we're talking about
how if people people like me people like
Linus we really have no business being
on the top of any Hall of Fame thing
because we're not like the pro
overclockers the theta is that now
because there are no price divisions
with hardware bots you're getting more
or less by your way at the top now
there's still some overclocking skill
involved obviously we still have to out
overclock Linus but we're not gonna
overclock someone like kingpin or get
Bauer or build Zoid so it's a bit weird
that you can buy your way up I hope
Hardware bots introduces price class
divisions in the future but for now it
benefits us you guys that's fine okay so
let's take a look at the system we're
just gonna film the screen for today
because we have enough technical issues
with with other things but yeah that's
that's fine so alright right now I have
no CPU overclock applied we're on stock
settings for everything in stock GPU I
have actually shorted the shunts on the
GPU so we're a bit ahead of where we
would be typically so I've shortened the
shunts
let's just let this run and see what
kind of score complete baseline gets
that way everyone can appreciate the
climb to the top as it goes but yeah so
the short the SH the shorts are shunted
the shunts are shorted there are three
of them on the Titan V that you need to
short and we have a video on that in the
past but basically I've got liquid metal
on three of them it's there
grisly conduct or not I have enough on
there the more you put on the more
you'll you'll short them out you can hit
a point where it doesn't really do any
or do it actually breaks your clocks so
we've done a moderate amount I know
there was a Lewis rossmann video
recently I'm like don't short your video
card shunts the thing is shorting shunts
is there's a few things about it first
of all we don't know what his customer
did they if you put too much on and it
spills over it can eat the solder around
the outside of the shunt so don't flood
it with liquid metal secondly for what
we're doing it's for benchmarking I mean
it's gonna be for however long the
stream is and then we'll wipe it out so
it's fine for the kind of things we're
doing here but I still wouldn't
necessarily recommend it for daily
because you're only getting a couple
percent performance uplift which is what
we want for a competitive benchmarking
especially vs. lioness who has a lot
more money than we do and can solve the
problem by throwing more money at it but
for daily usage I wouldn't really
recommend it that said there's been some
discussion by their Bower on liquid
metal and shorting shunts and I believe
the last time he talked about he didn't
see any any any of the solder chewed
away with a responsible amount applied
so I don't know
anyway wanted to adjust that cuz I know
people have seen the Lewis draughtsman
video he's got great points however
there are also reasons to shorten shunts
so we we disagree a bit there but he's
also not coming at it from an enthusiast
perspective so he's got a completely
different take on it
we're in graphics test 2 now we still
see P it has to go this is complete
baseline right now everyone we are
establishing okay you can short it with
a piece of I of wire and a soldering
iron the problem with doing stuff like
that you basically need a really long
wire because if you apply too much
liquid metal or in this case too short
of a line you'll end up with broken
clocks it'll basically go into 2d clocks
like
156 megahertz or something because
NVIDIA has sensors on the GPUs that will
see the resistances way off and it'll
freak out and break itself until I think
you can fix it just by removing the wire
or the liquid metal
but um yeah extra I'm pretty sure you
can because if you do too much liquid
metal will do the same thing so there's
a reason you do
liquid metal unless you're gonna run
like a really long wire or something
what's okay we got our first super chat
Sean says what cpu are you using a ha ha
ha ha ha ha ha laugh all you want but if
you're giving me 2 bucks to say 79 80 XE
I'll take it that's what we're using
currently under stock settings thank you
for the donation I appreciate it
and what else do we have here so yeah
first runs going let me see if there's
anything really interesting I can talk
about some of the setup I guess during
setup for this other than tripping the
breaker and setting us back 30 minutes
we also had some issues where I wasn't
sure that the block was making full
coverage like actual contact with the
vrm components so took it all apart
while it was hooked up to liquids
basically like holding the block over
here and reapplying thermal pads and
thermal paste and everything to the GPU
seems ok now I hope it's making contact
EK recommends one one millimeter
thickness pads but we yeah we're using
one millimeter so it seems okay and next
one I don't know how to pronounce that
mate Mattei says you can solder a
resistor there then yes you could
actually solder another shunt resistor
on top of the shunt resistor and
basically piggyback them we're not doing
that I want to be able to restore this
to basically stock settings after we're
done it's way easier for me to spend 30
seconds putting liquid metal on it and
then clean it off later but you're
absolutely right you could put multiple
shunt resistors on there and it probably
work a bit better thank you for the
donation so ok I think we're almost done
with the first run we can check with the
CPU or what the score is for complete
baseline then I'm going to tell you what
line has got so we know what we're
trying to
this is the new meme our our four says I
gave two dollars said say 79 80 XE no no
I will not say Sony 1980 XE $5.00 from
Jack who says if you screw up I will be
very disappointed you are not alone
thank you okay so next one or here's our
first first baseline score no
overclocked just to give everyone some
perspective if you ran it out of box the
out of the box score is seventy seven
seventy seventy four times by extreme
for reference graphics here is sixty
nine hundred and CPU is seventy eight
hundred so while you're looking at that
score I'm going to read you what Linus
got again just so we know what we're
shooting for Linus is currently ranked
sixth and I suppose Alex on his team
ranked sixth in the 3dmark Hall of Fame
they did not submit to hardware ba I
don't think and they have 80 92 for
their scores so our baseline without any
overclocks
it needs a thousand points to get up to
theirs and they got 77 31 on graphics so
that one needs to be 800 higher to match
theirs or so they got 11,000 CPUs so we
have the most work to do on CPU and we
can start with that
I guess let me take two or three more of
these super chats before I move on
bazinga X where is the cat eat the cat
we don't want snowflake anywhere near
this machine right now she she'll knock
things out like the fans are Christopher
says are you in the intel extreme rig
challenge no we are not I'm actually not
familiar with what they're doing with
that I've seen the name I don't know
what it is this year
and finally Brooke $2 is that a Dyson
power supply no I don't think Dyson will
ever want to talk to us so it is in fact
not a Dyson power supply so I think we
had 7000 something for our starting
score and we're just gonna do some we'll
start slow with the overclocks and see
what all needs to be done I get some
perspective on everything I am fairly
confident we can get up to line us a
score
but I will see one thing I should note
last time we did this stream with an X
299 dark motherboard I didn't know it
but well actually it's an even matter we
were using two sticks of memory and that
was intentional we just didn't have more
but it's gonna get loud for a second
when I ramped these fans up so yeah we
had two sticks of memory and that
actually quad channel matters a lot more
than I thought four four times by
extreme times by extreme is crazy memory
hungry actually I think we leave that
one alone one of these assists to fan we
want to eighty one of these is gonna be
super loud so hopefully I got that okay
yeah so last time we were on half memory
channels is this time that alone is
gonna change our scoring a lot I think
we're actually already pretty close to
our score with an overclocked last time
let's just start with XMP and then go
from there overclock let's start with a
very simple one let's just do 45 I'm
confident we can do 48 and then we can
see if we can push it past there and
we'll start with some basic voltage
settings I'm gonna put in what I know
our close to end values will be one
point three five is not necessary for
forty five pack so you need to turn off
a V X and let's set mesh ratio to
thirty-two so eight VX off mesh radio
ratio thirty-two that's higher than last
time we have four channels this time
thanks to the Trident z kit that's in
there right now so that'll be a big help
currently only at 45 X for the
multiplier and let me check apparently
we get a bunch of super chats or
something why are there so many of these
um May it says do a vacuum cleaner
instead of fans OC challenge it wouldn't
be fair we would be barred from hardware
bot for cheating like that Thomas says
good luck thank you we will probably not
need it but thank you anyway then ray
says I respect you guys you don't have
to say worse ok
the SLS AMG what are they out of the box
there are moles they're actually not bad
we were in the 80s we had plenty of
headroom when this was actually
overclocked and played minecraft and
test out of the box thermals No ok
alright
there's a bunch more I'll get to them in
a moment alright so we're just gonna set
1.35 for now for V Corp V mesh let's do
one point three five VSA one point
let's try one point - if it's not stable
go up to one point two five or something
one point two for BCC i/o uncor voltage
offset I want 500 millivolt offset I
think that's gonna be most of our
settings we'll mess with these a bit
more later - but that's plenty for
baseline it's more voltage than we need
which is fine because I don't want to
spend the whole stream crashing and
blue-screen things like that alright
then we're just gonna do XMP and see if
it's stable and I think we should be
good so let's start there and then we'll
we'll pick it up after that
okay so I'll read some somewhere these
while that's restarting and then I'll do
the rest
apparently it's unhappy with something
then I'll do the rest while it's running
the three mark tests
once we see if it even boots so many
super chats though thank you I didn't
get it which CPU was it yarn we've been
over this come on man
sorry 980 XE haha okay it's not happy
with something see where is the cat the
cat is not allowed in this room when
there are seven fans sitting on top of
the bench right now we're just kind of
rebooting people eight five oh two five
dollars if you give everyone a high five
high five yeah he's gonna give me five
dollars if I give everyone a high five
thank you hey it's still rebooting it's
a I'm gonna have to safety boot or
something Justin didn't how's it going
we ran a baseline applied a really
simple overclock and need to change some
settings base please where we are right
now
it's a booting this timer now
okay we're gonna clear CMOS
and boots please
it's minor
okay
once it's done having a fit
I'm just gonna flip the power there we
go okay hopefully that clear to CMOS
next ones mm-hmm so many you're still
getting back into BIOS right now go
forth Steve white my fellow Canadian off
that positions hard line is nothing
personal a sign my bat before you ship
it we have a signed mod bad option on
there that's speaking of those are
coming in Wow let's get into BIOS please
I think those will be here within the
next ten days or so they get to us and
then we will ship it out to anyone who
ordered them at that point the mod Maps
like the one I'm working on here if
we've made some changes to them okay
there we go
finally finally so I think what tripped
this I get a better angle this your
angle still okay on that
so let's just make sure it wasn't the
memory and then CPU multiplier perk or
let's do a 45 0 a B X 32 mesh not zero
match 32 mash 0 0 100 BC LK extreme
voltage might at 1.95 be core 1.35 is
way more than enough but that's fine
the mesh 5 BSA let's try one point two
to five one point two for i/o on core
500 ok so let's start there hardware
monitor we're just gonna blast these
I'll figure out which ones to loud later
okay alright what else what needs to be
done memory we can there's a lot of
memory tuning we can do later and we
will do later but for now we'll stick
with this stuff and I'll walk you
through it once we can actually just get
this thing to boot the UI Phii needs to
be legacy ok
all right so let me just double check
myself here 500 1.0 1.2 two five one
point three five one point three five
yes one point nine five 4500 3200 okay
let's let's see if it boots this time
it's not I might need to train it or
something all right
so that's going to boot why is it
beeping at me
there's so many super chats I'm going to
read through most of these as we get the
benchmark running right now I need to
get the Machine up and when time spies
running will read through a lot of those
J is on the list at number 24 yeah J I
think did his video with with kingpin
right that was pretty good one they flew
kingpin out to J's studio and set it all
up and I think he used that one too if I
remember correctly considering a Titan V
like I said basically buys your way to
the top that's pretty good
just got to get back into BIOS how's my
ex 5660 gonna compare you should be
cranking Dream Theater in the background
while we wait yeah that's a great way to
get the monetized
instantly it's unfortunate I totally get
it though come on let's go EVGA let's
get into BIOS
okay
we go
so let's just make absolutely certain
everything is where it should be restore
defaults look actually I should be fine
per core 44 let's do that zero zero
thirty-two don't really need this yet
but whatever 1.5
one point now there's gonna be some
let's just do one point two seven should
be fine for this there's gonna be some
annoying fan noise when I am NOT talking
too loud sorry about that
there's not a lot we can do about it
we've tried oh this I need to disable
this I missed that PSA one point two
five sure 122 okay if this doesn't go
like I want this time then we'll load a
profile and see if that'll do
do we have all memory channels yes there
are options
okay X and P one is this all Auto yes
okay mess with that later
legacy and fans I guess although you
don't really need them like crazy right
now
okay hopefully this boots this time
save profile Steve yes all right
okay let's hope that boots make it
easier all right lots of these things so
it's morphin times as it's Steve time to
kick Linus friendly ass let us see that
is the kindest way to say that I love
everything about this hashtag beat LTT
what cpu is that so that it's a 79 80 XC
you know line is gonna throw more money
at it
Kevin says it you could watch all TT
video on the intel channel i could i
don't yeah i don't know anything about
it right now
it sounds like it's booting this time
that's good Tom's that says what GPU are
using greetings from Norway we are using
a Titan V that currently has a shortage
shot mod on it and a Nikkei waterblock
it's I think it might be I don't think
it's the first they may be the second
water block for Titan V either way UK
sent that over with a 360 so that we
could do this and these are working
pretty well like I said I'm about eighty
percent confident on the contact with
the V RMS but I think we're good okay so
we did boot now just just remind
everyone we established a baseline of
about 7,000 points when no overclocking
anything was applied I think we're at
four point four or four point five
gigahertz I think four point four is
what I set it to for right now nothing
with memory yet and we're just gonna run
this and you know I'm gonna I'm also
going to get hardware info going and
then we'll just check the temperatures
after which should be absolutely fine
there's not really overclocked right now
okay so we'll check that after if it
completes successfully and let's let
that go all right so I'm gonna read some
chat stuff while that's running oh yeah
so just to catch everyone up there's a
lot of new people here baseline score
zero overclock at all on anything was
about 7,000 points line assist score is
80 92 so we need to
points his CPU score is 11,000 as GPU is
7700 last time my cpu score was limited
to under I think 8000 points this is
times by extreme I'm talking and a lot
of that limitation we didn't know until
later was because of the the memory how
memory in tens of times by extreme is
actually super memory intensive so
having quad-channel boosted us instantly
by a lot when I ran some preliminary
tests so that's what we're shooting for
test is running that looks somewhat
successfully at least why not lnto I
mean because the setup required and I
think they were on water so we're gonna
run water and see what we can do is just
bit of fun anyway
I know I've technically done lnto
overclocking but it was under the
guidance of one mr. dare power and you
should check them out or build Zoid also
if you haven't seen them
what's sorry what see people ate 502 as
promised thank you for the donation
Hayden Steve you're the man
congratulations in advance it's very
confident of you thank you still running
the benchmark by the way Cody says going
to overclock your mom for two dollars
okay mark and puff did you ever get your
hair caught in a fan that's great
question while we were messing around
with the with putting the block back on
the Titan V I was genuinely worried
about that or actually when we were
moving this monitor over here - yeah
it's six really high rpm fans one of
them spins at 3500 rpm and we have a a
what are those what are these called
softbox I guess we have a softbox
kind of that's a little flimsy er I
don't want the lights and it was getting
sucked into the fans and until we added
some tape to the bottom so yeah they are
genuinely dangerous but no no I have not
where is GN HQ are on the East Coast
from Nicholas thank you Lord Dreyer says
hey once you get rising to chips can you
please do a four and six threaded bench
I'm curious about how Boost 2.0 works
out and those workloads
we can look into it any comment on
Tara's new video gamers exes I don't
even know what it is let's we're still
running the benchmark let me see what
this video is you're talking about aqua
exhale or is that it is that you're
talking about is that the liquid he
showed at Gamescom or something if it is
if it is I mean I think it's cool I
don't I haven't seen his new video
though alright so next one will it bring
the ten teraflop barrier now only one
card can do that under the guidance of
one man that was the real bot crusher
thank you
ones house left CPU test and then we'll
have a second baseline to show you Piper
will oh I'm back to let everyone know
that they lost the game once again sorry
just the messenger Thomas Q of the good
work mate thank you please say I'm
quoting I'm quoting here this is just a
quote ebf says please say 87 100k is
best I'm just reading a quote David
Stoll G is $70 thank you more funds for
the bucket I guess that'd be the ice
bucket for next overclocked because
we'll probably need to chill the fate of
Linus retaliates or might need to go
further than that invest in a plane
ticket for build Zoid or something
alright let's see what the score is
for our second baseline overclocking by
proxy in that instance
how's my ex 5660 compared to that's not
too well
okay it's almost done by now 1080i
tomorrow
feee is pretty cheap should I get
something else or will I be fine with
water coin what a coins great there's no
problem with water clean at all I it is
it is overkill I guess in a lot of cases
but but that's okay alright so for
reference our temperatures were like 70
degrees on the CPU 73-67 is what that
simple overclock got us so we've got
another 800 points to go graphics core
7000 there at 7700 CP score 10 for 1 5
there at 11 thousand nine so yeah let's
let's beat that one first and then we'll
play around with the GPU after that and
like I said there at eleven thousand
nine I think that was ten thousand four
hundred previously we were in the I want
to say seven eight thousand range
because we're running dual channel so he
should be good there I would love to see
an Ln two over Luke live yeah so we
don't presently do that certainly
something I've considered but I will
plug build Zoid again he does great work
if you're not familiar with them go
check out actually hardcore over
overclocked in his channel he does stuff
with liquid nitrogen all the time okay
and I think he's in chat to me so let's
let's just do core first save everyone a
bit of time I guess and hopefully let's
push that 1.35 okay everything else okay
yes all right so we're just going up to
four point seven right now nothing with
memory yet that'll come probably last
just see if this freaks out again so I
think we're at 77 the for for absolute
baseline 7300 for the next baseline
which is four point four gigahertz no
GPU overclocked no actual serious CPU
overclock okay it's booting good and now
we're gonna see what a simple four point
seven gets us and then we'll push the
four point eight which is probably close
to where
this chip tops out I think it might be
able to do 4.9 on at least some course
our cooling is a lot better than last
time we've got so the CPU is delayed
it's 79 80 XE that's the new meme ones
at since last time it's deleted I'm
using thermal grizzly conductor not
between the die and IHS and I'm using
cryo not on top of it which is high
thermal conductivity paste and then
we've got a thermal take flow which is
just I just basically by reasoning for
that was I want a 360 radiator I want a
fast pump I don't want to build a loop
so the flow uses a 4.5 gen pump which is
faster and we hooked that up with two
maglev pros and one maglev not pro fan
and that seems to be going pretty well
okay so hardware info open just for
maximum temperatures so we're currently
what I say 800 points behind them I
think got a bit of ground to gain
shouldn't be too big of a deal
I don't know does anyone know what
clocks they were at because I'm actually
I didn't pay too close attention to what
they were benchmarking on okay so set
that to run and this is just a time spy
extreme benchmark again around four
point seven right now and someone post
and chat what what Linus is running cuz
I'm not sure actually someone says it
cool laboratory liquid ultra versus
conduct and I've done that test I've
done a lot of those tests with liquid
metal and it tends to be a difference of
about one degree Celsius which is often
within margin of error so yeah there's
not a honestly the liquid metals once
you get that far down there's not a huge
difference between them I think the
biggest difference is how they react
with different metals and I don't know
too much about that
but I can tell you about the performance
and it's basically equal next one after
this could you overclock a washing
machine now no I don't think I can I
don't know I'd start with that thoughts
on liquid metal in GPU and people who
keep saying like when I will dry out
after year so okay a couple things here
liquid metal on a GPU is not really
worth it the risk is a bit higher
especially on a Titan V your risk is
considerably higher there are a lot of
small SMDs surface mount devices
surrounding the core of the Titan V and
if you have any spillover and it gets on
those you can short it best-case
scenario it doesn't boot worst-case
scenario you damage or destroy a three
thousand dollar card
additionally the well I don't know about
Titan V Titan these a bit bigger and
it's more is a bit hotter but typically
with GPUs the direct eye contact that
already exists between the cooler and
the die is sufficient enough that liquid
metal is not going to get you much more
it's not like a cpu where you've got
with Intel and the APS I guess you've
got a layer of silicon adhesive that's
somewhat thick and you have a layer of
thermal paste that's somewhat thick and
those two things together all
pace isn't bad from a turn standpoint
those two things together mean that
Liquidmetal does a lot for you on the
CPU side because you're bringing the IHS
down closer to the substrate and closer
to the die and you're obviously
improving the thermal interface with
something that has many times higher
thermal conductivity so hopefully that
kind of answers that Oh your other
question like a metal drying out after a
year we've talked a lot of people that
that we've done some testing and some of
it's still in progress and will be for a
while but I can tell you that at least
one year on with conduct or not we've
been good on all the stuff we've deleted
in the past year and I think most of our
systems that are currently running with
it are at about the 10 month marker no
signs of degradation yet I haven't tried
to other liquid metals
I don't know how conducting art fairs
past the one-year mark I've asked
obviously biased but the people at
thermal grizzly what their expectations
are the company suggested that it should
be good for at least two years but I
haven't validated that because that
takes time so that was a long a long
time on that one but we are still
running the benchmark we're on CPU test
that's the last one for this I love your
content good luck today from bill one
chalo thank you nightcore fusion or I
got your question I'm getting behind on
these guys okay
drak soul gaming will you do benchmarks
for specter and meltdown actually I do
want to do that I've done a lot of
research on it I've spoken with Intel
and what their expectations are I've
spoken with researchers on their
expectations I think right now we're
just gonna wait for a little bit two
reasons one some upcoming travel but to
Intel keeps pushing these updates and I
don't want to find myself in a scenario
where I'm finishing all the benchmarks
and then another one comes out so we're
just gonna give it a week or two to cool
down and see if if this is kind of it if
they stop iterating because I I don't
want it and that's a huge time
investment like multiple generations of
CPUs so we're just gonna wait and see
when they're kind of done for now is
that a cue 6,600 no that was not so not
a txc thank you like gnosis
at this point I'm starting to think
Intel is just throwing a dollar at us to
make us say that over and over you know
you're all a bunch of shills that's what
you are see how it feels
turn the tides on you all right next
test score is coming in
and what are we
7400 K so at this point we need some
play around with memory and GPU CPU
score we're at 10 972 previously we're
at 10 4 or something 10400 we're almost
at 11,000 now linus is at 11,000 9 so
we're more or less on par with him there
let's finalize the CPU overclock and
then start playing around with the GPU
and that should that should get us up to
where they are in the least if not past
it so pretty good start though 10900 way
beyond what we were last time largely
thanks to quad channel Auto Frogger to
attack Jesus you're my hero thank you
thank you I'm glad to hear that
I appreciate the super chat it is
helpful
ok so let's push that to 48 so we're at
4.8 gigahertz in theory hopefully this
voltage is fine if it's not I'll push it
up a bit we have the thermal headroom to
do so I think we're in the 80s or
something so we've got some room CPUs
don't really care about thermals I'm
like GPUs up until there t.j.maxx so
until we're hitting like 100 degrees
we're fine ok the rest of these all look
okay for now it's a 48 there let's start
doing some memory stuff
it's 1.85 for voltage I'll leave those
at 16 for now set that to 28 see if that
works
what else can we - we got a couple
things we can do here this I want this
to be otto EVGA if you're watching or if
you watch later I here's what I want I
want to be able to type in the letter A
and make this say Otto and I don't does
gyro work if I do that does your
Everyman's your brain is a daughter ok
well I still want to be able to type A
Okay command right one let's go down
here
- 7 - 7 s or maxing out tre fi we're
gonna bring down t RFC to 300 TW r I
wanted written down to 16 I was talking
to build annoyed about this again I've
actually hardcore overclocking times by
extreme takes so much memory I'm not
sure we're gonna be able to maximum
enough to get it stable maybe later
maybe after everything else we come back
to that 6 6 4 r WD r 6 4 r w DD 6 4 r WS
r ok I think we can probably start there
yeah 1.8 5 volts for memory should be
fine no frequency missing the frequency
let's go up to 4,000 this kit the G
scale kits rated for 3600 I think it's
like I don't know I guess at CL 16 I
thought of a CL 18 but anything else I
want to do here
I think there is yes let's bring that to
6:00 okay all right let's try this
actually we should save a new one Steve
basic - all right okay so we're pushing
for 4.8 gigahertz now 4,000 my cards
memory hopefully see if it makes a post
beep or not
and I'm just listening for post so give
me one second guys
no okay
sounds like it booted all right fun fact
EVGA is motherboards boot beep once for
every USB device plugged in on boot so
if you want to make an orchestra of
noise you can plug in like 10 USB
devices it'll keep beating forever okay
so that's booting at 4.8 matéo
I think voucher $10 Canadian thank you
very much for the super chat put this
towards using mo RA 3 Pro next time I'm
actually not familiar with that
interesting
this looks okay okay uh you have alerted
me to it I will look into it for next
time thank you for the heads up
and the rest of the message says it will
lower delta T ambience or fluid and can
be easily put away from the set sounds
good to me
so we'll try that we'll try that next
time 80 thank you for the heads-up
there's an impossible amount of hardware
to keep up with obviously so I do
appreciate when you all let me know
about something that I might not know
about because then we can look into
buying it and running some tests okay so
4.8 i'll drag this over here after we'll
look at temperatures and let's just run
times by extreme actually let's let's
kind of save some time and just do the
cpu so that's the only thing I've
changed right now
now we'll do windowed mode as well not
gonna get a total score and our score
will be a bit lower on the CPU history
because it's the hardware info is
running but that's not gonna matter all
that much so okay that'll give us
that'll let us know if it's stable or
not and then from there we can go
further
Nikolas says try I feel like you're
making me say something bad but it's not
in English so YouTube won't care try and
say Han Han let me translate this first
translate.google.com
it doesn't look that bad if that's
that's actually what it means I have the
volume off on this machine Road growed
med flowed red porridge with cream
apparently Danish I don't know okay I
said it
thank you for the superjet any comments
to actually hardcore overseas new video
I'm sorry I don't I don't like I don't
know what they all are
I have to go check what you do builds
I'd would you do today OC adventure is
reference HD 5870 that sounds fun Ram
bandwidth versus frequency and timing
sounds good also that was from Laura
dryer next one is Mickel t says after
this could you oh we got that one
overclocked washing machine thoughts on
liquid metal got that one
what cpu running so every 980 XE right
oh yeah
yeah but if people keep doing super chat
say it all right so here's our CBS score
what was our temperature during that
period we have some thermal Headroom not
a lot anymore all right so first of all
CPU score I'm gonna drag this over is
11000 654 now to give everyone a
reminder I don't remember what do we
start at was it like 7000 or something
something like that our last one was ten
thousand four hundred now we're at
11,000 654 as a reminder we can come
back over to this monitor for one second
yeah okay as a reminder here's Linus's
score this is so there there's a couple
scores with time spike extreme if you're
not familiar there's the total score
which is this one there at 8090 - we
don't know what hours are hours is
presently because I didn't run the whole
thing you have the CPU score which is a
physics test it's entirely CPU bound
more or less eleven thousand nine we're
sitting at eleven thousand 654 so we're
okay there I might have some more room
but I'm pretty happy with that right now
so beating them their graphics score
seven thousand seven thirty one I don't
know where we're at out of box I think
it's like seven thousand so we have a
lot to gain here we're ahead here and we
can probably do a bit more maybe with
some more memory tweaking but I'm pretty
happy with that starting point so they
are at do they have the frequencies in
here okay so they assuming this is all
accurate they were at 4.8 gigahertz
which is where we are right now I might
push for four point nine briefly because
we have about what's our temperature
over here we maxed out during that test
at 90 degrees yes we were roughly ninety
degrees in that test so we've got about
ten degrees of headroom a little last
any five degrees so I might I don't know
that's gonna be awfully close I don't
think I might be able to do 49 maybe 49
at a couple cores but yeah that was so
that's what they were running let me see
what we can do for the next run here
let's do we need to start figuring out
now that we're having CPU kind of leave
that there for a minute we need to start
figuring out what our total score is so
I can get an idea of how much ground we
have to make up and I need to figure out
for example do we need to put the most
effort into pushing our CPU score
further or can our GPU carry some weight
because if their GP is better than ours
I'm gonna have to try and claw back
points in the CPU score the CBO score is
not worth nearly as much in times pi
extreme because it's so GPU bound so
that's kind of the thought process I
have right now coming into this how much
have you earned on super chat so far I
have no idea but I do appreciate it
from Laura dryer again I think that's is
that Norwegian kroner
I think that's Norwegian kroner Frank
Johanna jónasson Jonason says most time
spent I was seen a PC probably i fought
pretty hard with some Zeon's because we
have a Xeon that's kind of unlocked but
not really and it's it's unlocked enough
where you can you can get some decent
frequency out of it I can't right it's a
12 core
leaves a 12 core it's an old 1x 7912
core I spend a lot of time with that
probably probably two days playing
around with that ultimately to be
unhappy with it if you're talking about
like single PC that would probably be it
so anyone joining in now we're running
the first graphics test in our next time
spy complete run and that'll tell us
where we stand vs. Linus tech tips this
is a friendly rivalry with Linus and his
team Alex the great ish as he's called
on Twitter I believe I ran their tests
for their singularity PC build and I
think they're at 4.8 gigahertz on the
CPU they had a Titan V in there under
under liquid and their score is 8000
something 8090 to total 11,000 on the
CPU which were passed now and 7700 on
the GPU which we are presently behind on
so we've done a couple things I'll run
everyone through the bench again this is
a bunch of you I think I've filtered in
but we'll let this finish first next
question
love your content and dedication and
keep it up from agra kami thank you I
appreciate it we will definitely keep it
up
Tom's can you overclocked an H 500 PEP s
what cpu is it it's a it's a 79 80 XE
can you overclock the H 500 P I mean I
guess we kind of did that already when
we fixed it by adding mesh to it next
question
wishbone is there any more front mesh
full towers coming out that's a great
question what is coming out I know a
couple of things coming out and none of
them have full front mesh I
Silverstone's cut so here's the thing
Silverstone has been working on front
mesh designs for a while now and I was
talking to them about this recently
because I at CES and they know this I
was a little disappointed with what they
showed and it's because a lot of it was
following the trend of a flat front
panel relatively poor ventilation
although better than most of the
competitors but not better than
Silverstone's previous products and I
was disappointed by it and I let them
know and basically it was a matter of
them saying you know we we need to
compete in this industry and this is
what people want right now so if you
disagree with that sentiment and you
want mesh front panel cases find a way
to let Silver's don't know because
someone needs to tell them like hey the
stuff you were doing with cases that
have air flow keep doing it
we've certainly told them but I'm not
buying tens of thousands of units like
consumers are so my word only gets so
far to answer your question there is one
coming out within the next six months
but I can't say anything about it right
now there'll be more at Computex but I
don't know the details on them I only
know details on one mesh front panel
case right now it's a derivative of
something else that exists and will let
you know as soon as we can let you know
more
dude Dunamis says coffee on me $5 from
New Zealand I think thank you we'll
spend that on fried chicken or something
later still running by the way okay here
we go CPU test is done so let's see what
we did for CPU score in the hash tag rip
LTT challenge that's looking better so
we started at 7070 our baseline was
that's what our baseline was in the
urban clocks it's to stop this shake our
graphics score here is our weakest point
right now CB scores thought eleven
thousand six hundred six hundred points
ahead we have bit more room in the tank
I think graphics were at seven thousand
so we need to gain about ten percent in
performance which hopefully overclocking
can do CPU temperatures are what we're
in the 90s so we don't have a ton of
head room for further CPU overclocking
but I might play around with it I think
it's time to get afterburner going and
this is where we're gonna have some
trouble because this CPU or the GPU
rather has had some issues with holding
over clocks in this benchmark so what
I'm gonna do first and this will be
interesting for you all as well I'm
applying nothing for frequency on the
core what was that result okay everyone
remember this number seven thousand ten
seven thousand ten is our graphics core
all I'm doing is maxing out the power
limit hopefully it stays stable it
should I've had issues with this card
crashing a lot today but I'm hoping to
stay stable and what this will tell us
is from 7010 baseline
what does increase in only the power
limit do for us and ignoring the
frequency in memory and just letting the
GPU regulate itself with more power of
revision and while this is running I'll
get back to super chat in a minute but I
want to walk back over to the bench and
for anyone who has tuned in you know in
the last since fifteen minutes after we
started I'll show you what what's going
on here
so I think we're going to hand camphor
this give us a second it's not enough
light ah
watch your HDMI cable I think you're
good though okay so catch her one up if
you already saw this sorry it'll be
brief and sorry about the fan noise okay
first of all Titan V under an ek Titan V
water block they sent us a blue fluid
that's actually awesome I appreciate it
because it's basically GN blue so
there's our pump and reservoir and we're
going into a 360 millimeter radiator
which is right here it's got a soon on
Maglev fan so here's here's some fun
trivia if you didn't know this fan this
soon on fan and the bottom left here is
the basically om version of what becomes
these Corsair Maglev fans up here so the
the soon on soon on makes course there's
my club fans coarser does a couple
things too and there's so they do offer
value but I get these for about 13
dollars a piece the soon on ones and if
you're just doing something like this
it's great it's 3500 rpm I haven't
turned down to 80% right now this is a
Vardar this is a maglev non-pro - maglev
is another one in the middle
Nach to up here just in case the prm's
don't have perfect contact to the cold
plate so it's a full coverage block now
get back to what I was saying we do have
this shunt the shunts shorted right now
and I don't think we have a great way to
show that unfortunately but basically
applied liquid metal to the shunt here
the shunt resistor here and then one
more that's over here under the water
block it's not contacting it it's just
under it so we've shorted the three
shunts which in the past I think from
our old content if I remember correctly
we showed about a 3% performance uplift
not something I recommend for daily but
something that we're gonna need here
because I think Linus is Titan V is
better than ours so we're gonna try and
combat that a bit by uncapping our our
power line with some extent we're
changing the resistance basically so it
doesn't give you really higher frequency
doing this what it does is it gives you
more stable frequency at the highs so
it's not like you offset higher is that
your offset holds higher for longer and
on that throne will take Flo 360 over
here going to the CPU so the sea view of
the GBR isolated loops and I chose that
one and this one because there 360
I have fast fans and the pumps are fast
on both so we can circulate the liquid
through and get it cooled down faster
which if you're not aware does actually
have a significant impact on performance
so okay I need to catch up with chat and
see what everyone's saying we need to
buy soon on fans I don't think I guess
you guys can't post links digital keno
shorting three of them actually does
help we tested that someone say I think
you're only supposed to short three -
there are four total on the card there
are three that we shorted and I tested
doing only two before and it didn't work
or didn't work as well I don't remember
the details but digit key anyway digit
keys where I buy this you non-fans okay
and also if our audio desync overtime
sorry there's nothing I can you can't do
much about it okay so yeah we're not
connected to internet or anything I'm
not submitting scores right now but CPU
test is almost done I'll go through a
couple more of these micro casting st.
Louis says hey thanks for the great
content any new info on the CTS labs in
situation I published everything I know
as of now in yesterday's news video if
you haven't seen it I think the first
eight minutes are dedicated to that the
update is they stopped answering my
questions
I believe they stopped answering Tom's
Hardware and an attack and they never
answered any of our questions about
financial involvement in the stock
market with AMD or about involvement
with Viceroy beyond their blanket
statement to press saying Viceroy is not
our customer that's different from being
involved advice right though
so they skirted that one that's my
latest update which I know is not really
that great do you have a heat monitor
measure device if you mean like a
thermocouple reader yes we use them all
the time okay so basically long story
short we need to increase the clock big
surprise so
let's try let's just do like a tea here
let's just do 50 here I with fire strike
so fine I can times 5 behaves
differently we were stable up to I drag
this over here
we were stable up to 200 megahertz of
offset and 200 Hertz offset on the 8 on
the HBM and the core and some of our
tests during the review time spy doesn't
like those settings at all it crash hard
crashes so we have to start a lot lower
here so let's just apply those and kind
of start it slow so that we're not
instantly disappointed at the GPUs
capabilities and then we'll see if we
have to drag more performance out of the
CPU graphics for 7008 I think or 6
basically no different so in this
instance I don't know maybe the shot mod
is playing around with it but in this
instance that's that's what we're stuck
right now so let's this next one's
running graphics test one's going ok
anything that's Shanthi confirmed
vulnerabilities in a forum post today
that's good to know
and I never washed into the
vulnerabilities this is going back to
the CTS Labs thing so CTS Labs we have a
big video on it I think it's called like
and the assassination attempt you should
watch it if you haven't but their
vulnerabilities we spoke with expert
researchers who discovered meltdown
inspector a couple of them and they
confirmed with us loosely off record for
the most well one mine on record later
but mostly off record confirmed with us
that they believed the exploits and the
vulnerabilities cts labs reported to be
of merit and rooted in legitimacy
whatever one I spoke to questioned and
I'm questioning as well as I get more
into it is the the professionalism and
the method of presentation of that data
it's written in a very aggressive
fashion it doesn't have a lot of
technical detail in the initial post
they later added some very highly
aggressive though and Viceroy somehow
had a 30-page like tirade like just
giant diatribe out within 30 minutes or
sort hours anyway of CTS labs report
going up and they said Viceroy the
president said that someone leaked them
the document Viceroy and CTS claim that
they're not connected
CTS only has a couple of employees
Viceroy says someone leaked on the
document and they took a sizable short
position on AMD so I questioned the
motive behind all of it because the tone
of publication is so oddly aggressive
that it just seems strange to me so
that's I think that's my update on the
CTS lab situation but moto moto
motorsport says 1098-t oh you mean like
the Phenom right we I think we test one
of those recently we did a revisit
thanks for the three bucks
man-bat ever considered to run Windows
10 Enterprise LTS B 2016 on the
testbench ltsp has no store no edge less
Windows 10 background services yeah I
mean the maybe for something like I
don't know I don't know I honestly don't
know anything about it but eliminating
background service is great we wouldn't
run it on our normal test benches
because you have to retain some level of
reality with those because we're
ultimately reporting on consumer
products with those so although we do
try to keep a really highly clean
environment for testing we also try to
establish a barrier where we say okay
we're drawing the line here we need to
keep some level of consumer relatability
with our tests so Windows 10 with all
the that's involved with it is
where we do that line test is running by
the way I think we have like an 80
megahertz overclock I think on the core
of the GPU and fifty something 25 and 50
on the HBM thank you Steve for your
extensive testing absolutely it's what
I'm here for thank you for the $2 Travis
peacock says need to use that Dyson in
pole to bring down
yes we do a push/pull of Dyson we
already went over this though it's
actually disallowed from the hardware
bot scoring system sadly media would
have an unfair advantage naturally
actually linus would totally kick our
asses then because he could just hook up
that Dyson to the cpu and I think create
creates sub ambient temperatures which
should be physically impossible but not
with that all right
benchmark complete temperatures we've
still got now yeah we're hitting like 94
on some of these now so we're at a
Headroom so that's because ambient has
increased quite a bit there we go now
we're getting big jumps okay so let's go
over to go over what we have here recap
everyone that was within 80 megahertz
core 50 megahertz HBM we're at 78 98
right now for the total score graphics
74 77 CPU is still 11600 so to recap
Linus is that okay let's get this up all
right so we'll recap a few things here
and hopefully you can see it okay we're
not doing screen captures it's too much
to set up all right so this is a Hall of
Fame time spike extreme on 3d marks
website Hardware bots got a different
ranking but same idea they didn't submit
theirs to Harvard bot so we're just
going off of this so what we have we are
presently before I think we just beat
that score yeah we just beat our old
score but I haven't connected the
internet yet so we were presently at 76
88 points total and let me show you the
impact of having four memory channels
for this test
it's pretty crazy previously we're at 74
61 for graphics core we're at 74 77 now
and I think part of that is shorting the
shunts I didn't do that last time if I
remember correctly so we might have some
more headroom here still CBS core we're
at 9,000 now we're at 11,000 600 so
getting into into big increases there
and that's largely because two problems
one I only have two six in memory last
times for a dual Channel two
thanks to night-night dark
coincidentally had a busted channel on
it so I had EVGA replace it because one
of the channels was dead anyway
previous scores 7688 we're currently at
seventy eight ninety eight let's see
where that would theoretically put us
that would theoretically put us seventy
eight ninety eight so we're right at JBN
ten ten what was this person's CPU score
so this person eleven thousand seven
forty six they're a bit ahead of us
there I can pass that that's within
margin of error
next one seventy nine forty four capstat
two what's their scoring 11200 we're
past that score for CPU but they're
they're ahead of us by a hundred points
on GPU which is I think weighted heavier
for this benchmark eighty twenty four
for this person I can't read that
and then line us up here at number six
eighty ninety two and we want to shoot
through the stars I guess we could try
and pass deserve here at eighty one
thirty eight so what's surf score if we
want to get ambitious if you want to get
ambitious we passed the CPU score but
he's got a way high GPA score we can try
it though right so if we pass line if
that puts us in six that we pass this
person puts us in fifth let's go ahead
and do another overclocked run and I may
end up trying to push the CPU harder to
get a bit of extra Headroom so let's
push this up to a hundred and just see
if it's stable I've had a lot of
instability issues past this point so
I'm gonna leave that there for now and
again it clocks hire and fire strike but
times by extreme really hates GPU clock
over clocks or at least mine anyway I
had a checked chat and everything
okay so can everyone up I think you're
all pretty much caught up right now 4.8
gigahertz on the CPU we have a meme
going where apparently if you donate the
super chat and say what CPU then I look
disappointed and say what it is
we have 4.8 gigahertz memory we have so
we're maximum dry now we have 32
gigabytes in there I want to say yeah 32
it's rated for 3600 I think CL 16 we're
at 4,000 we've done some memory timing
tuning and also our maximum to something
like eight or nine gigabytes which is
intentional it helps with stability a
bit because otherwise windows can cause
some crashes and then the GPU we've
pushed a little bit which is underwater
I want to read some of these questions
Justin Parrish is G on going to review
the thermal take view 91 super tower is
that I think I know what that is hang on
don't take vo 91 oh yeah I think I dunno
what this case is no we're not planning
on reviewing that case I saw it I saw it
at CES a couple problems with that one I
don't want it in my house because it's
gigantic
and also the view 91 it is kind of like
the SMA eight which we've also looked
into benchmarking for air you start
getting as a territory where it's so far
outside of what's reasonable for our
testbench that it's almost irrelevant
like the SMA eight again it's a great
example which I think we might try and
get and do open loop testing on
standardized in which case I would test
the view 91 but it's clearly I mean it's
that case is too big and it's not at all
built for what we test with so probably
not if there's enough interest maybe I
do know that the view 91 is really is
limited volume so I don't think they're
making a lot of them
Jennifer Roger says for the future
snowflake plushies also rip LTT yes
that's the hashtag hashtag rip ltte if
you wanted
join in the fun make sure to tag them on
Twitter send them this way
as a lot has popped up in chat has
anyone seen the Linus tech tips
accountant chat still running the next
test by the way graphics - I think win
not so Steve do you ever look in the
mirror and say to yourself damn I'm just
too good I think earlier I looked in the
mirror and said the opposite of that
because we tripped the power trip the
breaker which was why we're late to the
stream because overclocking so this
coarser a X 1600 I it plugs in via USB
and it's got what I believe is a fairly
accurate power reading through software
you can check through the wall obviously
your current clamp but that indicated we
were doing something like I think we
were hitting a thousand watts which
isn't crazy but the wall is 15 amp the
breaker the circuits 15 amps and we had
other stuff going to so yeah no I did
not say that moving a frag says running
the time spike extreme for the first
time on the stock settings right now
welcome welcome to the party got only 50
126 for the total score I suppose 47 91
GPU 8500 CPU should I try to overclock
I'm sure that's the whole point of it do
so within reason the the best way to
kill something overclocked in your CPU
would be pushing voltages that you don't
understand - hi so do research I'll give
you some quick pointers I don't did you
say what CPU you're on you didn't say
what CPU you're on but I'll give I'll
give a run some some basics so with AMD
be careful of SOC voltage pushing that
too high is very bad it'll degrade over
time with Intel be careful of SI system
agent voltage VC CSA is often what it's
called putting that too high is also
deadly well yeah any voltage can be
deadly I guess you push it high enough
but your biggest concern is degradation
over time without knowing it because you
won't find out for months if you pushed
it too high and suddenly what will
happen is your clocks won't go as high
as they used to or they
require more voltage to do so so yeah
absolutely overclock it's fun it's cool
to learn about the hardware it'll teach
you a lot but be willing to invest some
time to research just just start with
like Google safe voltage for your CPU
check multiple sources against each
other don't trust one and that'll give
you a starting point the safe voltages
that are published on forums are often a
bit conservative so you should be fine
so let's look at our score 79-71 what
did I say we're trying to be 80
something was at 80 90 what GPU is it
good luck man go for number five it's a
Titan V and we will definitely go for
number five 80 92 is what we're trying
to beat we're at 79-71 versus Linus tech
tips 80 92 and they have a 77 100
graphics core we have 75 50 so we're a
decent bit ahead 600 points ahead and
CPU we need to gain in graphics and CPU
I guess to try and make up for it so
what kind of room do we have here I
think we can do some more CPU tuning got
a couple points there we only really
need like 40 points which is also close
to variance so let's see if it crashes
when I push this to like 75 I think it
will but we'll give it a shot that's HBM
to voltage on the Titan V and you know
what we should actually save some time
and just run that GPU only because we
don't need to do the whole thing if
we're just trying to see if the graphics
test is stable
gpo only okay so let's see how that does
we're kind of getting to my limits here
on the Titan V I think but I think we
can do it we need 40 points
just reading so a hashtag rip GN we got
this that is not your on the wrong side
of history my friend okay see mm-hmm s
to s RT Tech Jesus has risen and said
heathens that are LTT must be put in
their place the tech Messiah has spoken
I've scrolled off screen probably for
the best your profiles should be Tech
Messiah
Jeremy Zeta says this is a small view
brewery a brewery if you will have some
celebratory fried chicken after your
victory we will absolutely do that
Thank You Xena I approach appreciate it
always good to see you in chat now as
she's still running any good Netflix
recommendations from bill honcho I have
no idea
I don't watch Netflix uh-huh I like
Grant or Amazon or whatever it is it was
on Prime Robert male $5 Leone Leo will
have an aerodynamic one that's a great
question
we have already agreed to sampling we're
waiting for them to arrive I don't one I
don't know if that my head when will get
them I don't know if thought my head
when they review embargo lifts and I
couldn't tell you anyway but we will be
reviewing at least one of them somewhat
immediately and I'm not positive which
is coming out first but I definitely
want to look at both because when we saw
them at CES I think no they were
definitely the my favorite case from CES
the Leone Leone Erin dynamic they're
good they're good well-designed we'll
see how they perform but looks good Zach
Fisher is 2164 megahertz on a 1070 good
yeah that's very good hydro H 105 good
for it you know I don't really remember
that H 105 is that the coolant one
we're running graphics 2h 105 which
cooler is this oh no this is ace attack
yeah that's a he's attack for sure I
mean it's fine I don't really all the
ACE tech coolers at the same size or
more or less the same all that's
different as the fans if you're
replacing them anyway you can kind of
buy any of them warranty matters it's a
next question Kevin Ashby we're just
waiting on this test to finish don't
know if it was posted already but Linus
had the CPU at 4.8 gigahertz and the GP
at 1912 thank you that's very valuable
information we're at 4.8 so we've got
the CPU and I we're ahead quite a bit so
they didn't oh they didn't do any memory
tuning I think they were at JEDEC specs
and I think they had like 100 gigabytes
of memory this benchmark is memory
hungry but not that much so I think
we're ahead in memory profile tuning all
right so reminder we did not run CPU
that time we're trying to see if GP is
stable and it was 76 78 it's pretty good
ok so here we go here's the moment of
truth let's let's run this properly the
full thing and see if that puts us past
Linus and then we'll try and take v
after that just because v is a nice
psychologically secure number 5 sounds
better than 6 then you can say you're in
the top 5 without anyone having to know
that your 5 flora dryer yes you're right
about knock ok cool Mohammed says had to
turn on VPN to donate otherwise I get
function not available in your area
YouTube must be thinking that the
donation from Africa has Ebola I
appreciate you going through the VPN
that certainly helps I didn't know that
YouTube had such restrictions that's
weird power consumption 2000 watts no
the power supply is a 1600 watt power
supply it's like what's the max is it
titanium these days I think it's 80 plus
titanium if I remember correctly the
story Corsair told me at CES was that
they were actually trying to trying to
ask the 80-plus organization to add a
new certification for this power supply
and the 80-plus group said no but no so
we're not a 2,000 watts
I check in a bit I don't have a current
clamp or anything on any of this but
we're doing a thousand watts earlier
when I had a lower overclock on it so
somewhere around there maybe a bit more
okay
bazinga axe next one who asks what CP
you tell them 386 DX 40 crush Alliance
this is war damn right pick a side
Martin what's with EVGA showing no love
for the classified line my 1080
classified has no full cover water
blocks I don't know I wasn't aware of
that actually I think we have a 1080
class I think no actually I don't think
we do I think we have the FTW so I never
got a classified for that one JC keep up
the excellent work GN here's some lunch
money so you guys don't have to do a Q
reviews I appreciate it
Dyson did not approach us however we've
been approached by companies of similar
relevance to our industry and I've said
no but the direct donations from viewers
and things like patreon do legitimately
help as do I'll plug it now while this
is running the mod mats so if you don't
have one store that gamers Nexus Don
that we have one here on demo this is
pretty scratched up but it's still
really durable this one is our original
sample we've improved them a lot since
then
so we've improved the durability a lot
there's a lot of like liquid metal stuff
on here I need to wash it but we've
improved the durability a ton since then
we actually we got rid of the background
color for the next round so this dark
gray here will be gone it's just gonna
be a black color of the mat now which is
can I do this safely that's the color it
will be which is actually going to be
it'll be a bit better it'll it'll reduce
the amount of paint it'll help with
durability further with it which is
something we invested in before the
final production run so yeah these are
going to be shipping within the next two
weeks stored a camera's nexus net you
wanna pick one up there anti-static not
meant to be mouse pads clearly I'm using
them using this as one but it is an
anti-static mat first and foremost meant
to protect the table and ground you it's
made actually in a factory that makes
stuff for clean rooms so we were pretty
damn serious when we expect it out which
is which is why the price is the way it
is because low volume plus really high
material is a make sure a good product
but you know one that we have to do in
limited volumes because we're not a
giant manufacturer so this test is going
I think we're on CPU now like I said
please do consider the mod mats because
we've got a good amount coming in this
time we sold out instantly last time and
I think we might again but we'll see
should ship last week of March first
week of April if you want one and this
is seconds away from finishing
GPS score was somehow yet so many time
that was okay Adams Schnabel $2 thank
you say hi to snowflake from me from
engineer 6 I will do that however she is
banned from this room because I don't
want her or her tail anywhere close to
the 7 fans we have on bench
is that it ash so close eighty
thirty-one the score to beat is eighty
ninety two so we're trying to be eighty
ninety two that's Linus's score
we're at 80 thirty one right now wait
what happened to our cpu score that
drops six hundred points
weird that's interesting now what if we
throttled or something let's we can
recover that for sure that's definitely
recoverable because that's the CPU score
we lost not the GPU so let me save this
one hundred and seventy five or eight
got it
and let's just double-check everything
in BIOS because we just drop six hundred
points on the CPU which sounds to me
like potentially throttling we might be
getting there it's the rooms warmer than
it was earlier but I didn't swap a fan
if I have to or we give it a break for a
minute
I think I ran that bench basically
immediately after the previous one as
well as just probably still warmed up
all right so he needs sixty points to
beat lioness and crew I might try to see
all 15 but I think we're gonna wait on
that for a minute what do I have for fan
Headroom
that's just vrm but let's just go ahead
and max that out too okay so I max out
the vrm fan just in case
we do have things we can do here
primarily trying to go down to CL 15 and
we can try and push like 2 cores to 49
otherwise I think we're good to get oh
really okay so let's let's just try this
again and see if it was just a thermal
thing because if we can pick up those
600 points and get back throw eyes on
the previous run then we'll we'll pass
them decrease ambient now we actually
should do that can you lock that or you
you tether with the headphones if you
just drop it one degree on the
thermostat
okay so Andrews and round the cameras
drop in our temperature or our
thermostat by one degree so that should
help a bit it's actually getting pretty
damn warm in here there we go
ac is on like like that the air
conditioner is part of the war chest for
overclocking we're considering going
chilled or something but we'll see what
if if Linus retaliates I don't know
we'll see I don't know that he'll
respond he's got bigger fish to fry but
I would like to I would like to see them
up the ante and the way that only Linus
tech tips would do and then we can
respond in kind so let's try this see if
it's stable and everything let's just
let me just double check temperatures
make sure we didn't really mess
something up thermally okay it's
reasonable now it's in the 30s I'd like
it to be lower we dropped the thermostat
a bit but that'll take a minute to kind
of decrease room temperature so we'll
let that run and see how that goes i
might like open some windows or
something if we need to ice water yeah I
know we considered it okay let's see
builds oh I just telling you to call him
okay builds I'll message you on this
card I can probably get my laptop or
something to do a call I don't think I
have it set up here to do that
your timing it's okay what can we
improve build Zoid from actually
hardcore overclocking says your timings
they suck all right that's good that's
what I want to hear it for him to
approve them TR our DS should be for
okay we can do that after this run just
see what our baseline is see our RDL
should be six okay I want to see where
this goes first and then I'll take
builds edges advice do you have any over
Clark tutorials out no I I mean well
yeah I think we do have some old ones
for GPUs which are a bit simpler I'm not
I can give you basics clearly I'm not
really qualified to do heavy overclocked
tutorials that's build Zoids territory
they're Bower people like that damn cop
so actually hardcore overclocking and
they're Bower are both XOC channels if
you want more detailed stuff go check
them out they I mean builds what I think
just did like an hour long memory video
the other day
Trent sword dragger Linus getting bin
the Titan V he's confirmed his is better
than ours I think c-max beast $10 is
there a good guide to overclock the
4770k yeah so if you're looking for OC
guides overclock dotnet has really good
ones I would recommend starting there
coolant is already hot does that affect
the score now yes yeah well I mean it
doesn't affect the score directly but it
affects if the if it's an extra I think
we had five degrees of headroom
previously so if it's an extra five
degrees warmer which is completely
within reason then yes it's possible we
thermal throttle which would explain
this huge six hundred point drop off of
our clocks which phone who has the
highest benchmarks with Andy CP and Vega
I'm not sure Hardware bots and three
marks hall-of-fame would have that
Kennett runs to run SimCity for now
no I don't think you can okay what
spilled Zoid saying teapot should be 16
that is quite a bit lower we can do that
sure
okay so we've got some timings to
improve after this is done I think we're
in the graphics test yeah we're still in
graphics test right now so we need to go
through CPU testing still which will be
next
okay couple more comments
CJ Hanson says Sierra ray Spalding
should buy will Hanks a new graphics
card the roomie needs a new GPU and made
us can be with you I think I've just
just contributed to some roommate
subversion Dre G says dust must be a
problem if only you had Tyson nori we're
a snowflake PS shout outs to Zeta
snowflake is as I said banished from
this room so she doesn't jump on the
bench
bill want a low what CPU well bill let
me tell you about the 486 processor it's
a 79 80 XE Russian name I'm sorry I
don't know how to say that does coursers
are 275 top mesh filter match the
dimensions of the 270 I'm not sure yeah
- somebody doesn't have a dust filter
right that was a downside it's very
similar to land if not identical so I
think if it doesn't fit it could
probably be made to fit maybe try try
email of course there's our made
department tell them you have a 270 and
you want to buy the 275 ours dust filter
see what they say maybe they'll ship one
to you for free or something
Torben Hanson $5 thank you almost at the
end of the CPU tasks guys and we'll see
that our score is Wyatt what's the GPU
Titan V Gabriel Langevin show us around
hope more merch is coming soon yeah so
like I said mod mats are the big thing
for us we do have more stuff coming
eventually it just takes a while to do
all the all the go-betweens of the
factories and stuff - oh there we go
okay
what was theirs 80 90 something 80 90
tear that's like that's just margin of
error at that point Dan okay
okay let's I mean we're gonna I think we
could pass it I just sat your and ran it
over and over again but let's do builds
wide suggestions let's make a little
faster was I saying yeah we have more
stuff coming
my job is media production but I am
trying to do more work on custom
products we're trying to really take the
the GN quality brand and apply it to
stuff that you can use for system
building so we're making more stuff the
mod mats the big thing for us right now
I'd like to see those continued to sell
through because it's a major investment
for us we're not a manufacturing company
but we're learning a lot doing better
each run I'm very happy with the
progress
Tifa what did you say 16 or something
okay build Zoid from actually hard core
overclocking is helping me right now
we've gotten to that point so Tifa 16
rrd s4 okay rrdl six think we're already
there yeah we're already there on that
one I got that one right 101 be CLK
might be viable he yes maybe it will try
that last TRC should be tear ass plus
TRP tear ass could probably do 26 okay
tear ass wait 1 2 26 ok and what was the
other thing here tear ass plus TRP
should be TRC yeah
TRC we're on auto right now do we want
to stay on auto mr. build Zoid or do i
manually type something in how about the
rest of this stuff anything here okay so
why don't one BC okay we might try me
let's let's try it let's just save this
as a profile Steve easy one okay let's
try 101 BC okay I might fail it does
that's fine we'll bump it back down okay
that might need to go up we'll see TRC
242 okay let's do that as well I guess
hmm if it boots we'll see you at boots
first
okay that's promising so we are booting
I'm gonna do one more change for filled
Zoids notes I think we were at 80
something Haiti 86 something like that
we're trying to be 80 92 that is within
margin of error as I said I could sit
there and keep running it over and over
till it passes them or we do something a
bit more secure and apply some better
clocks and or timings in this case and
make it a bit harder for everyone
okay
what was the suggestion here TRC 242
okay so let's do that so build Zoid if
you're listening do you have any
commentary you want to add that I can
read for everyone on what the timings
you just had me tune do like t fob we
can talk about that one you mentioned t
follow me before
give me a run-through of that and chat
or something I'll read it out okay so
booting looks like it might be stable
for a boot at least we'll see if its
tail for a benchmark ebf ever thought of
running cold to tap water from the
faucet into a loop for consistent
cooling i've thought about doing i mean
before this we think about doing dry ice
basically in a bucket with an antifreeze
I think Titan V's encounter a called bug
at negative 10 so we'd be okay up until
that point and considered it but we got
to leave something on the tank
please pass
thank you all right so that's running
with the new timings we'll see if it's
stable this is maximum that eight
gigabyte 8.9 gigabytes something like
that - white tends to eat a lot of
memories that's the best we can do with
maximum we have a light overclock on the
video card it's a Titan V I think we're
100 megahertz poor 75 HBM I say light
it's light compared to some of our no
it's actually pretty good cuz times by
enumerates the clock a bit differently
than some of our other tests we've shown
let's see who else catching up on the
super chat stuff Adam Schnabel says lose
the TT Mouse oh is it the TT one yeah I
don't like that Mouse actually I'm only
using it because I only have to click on
like three things before I have to stop
touching it here's a small donation to
the G on more stable table fund yeah I
mean we've talked about that this is an
adjustable height table so that's where
most our problems come from I did
tighten the legs today though okay yeah
it's still scrolling up still catching
up
okay go for number five yes we're doing
that one point four is one point four
vcore on 1800 x too much for 24/7 at
four gigahertz can you bring it down a
bit uh that's I think it correct me if
I'm wrong
where's builds I that there is correct
me if I'm wrong I think one point four
is okay but I haven't read up on or even
looked at the 1800 extra rise in CPS for
a while we're focusing on new CP is
right now so it has to refresh my own
memory and look at our own reviews put
rip LTT in the description when you
submit i can do that
that's from Alexander Kiley user I
really like the idea of standardized
custom loop testing different cases
please follow through I'm not promising
it I do want to do standardized custom
loop component tests I don't know if
I'll do it with complete cases like we
do with air coin that's a lot of work
it's a lot of overhead and I'm not
afraid of doing a lot of work but it's
enough work where we probably lose money
until our our kind of like baseline
views increases so we might go that
direction first what will probably
happen is standardized open-loop
component testing like blocks because
that's easier to do and I can I can do
that on my own but for the most part
waffle fur ever consider using a fat
alpha cool monsta or the super fat
phobia extreme radiator for these
someone pointed me towards some fat
radiators earlier so i would say yes in
the last couple hours i have what was
your first computer is a pentium for
hyper-threaded cpu i don't remember the
name of it with whatever GPU is out of
the time 512 megabyte X 800 or X 1800 or
something like that
whichever one came out in the early
2000s I know there's another one later
do you like memes apparently we like
creating them like Pia what CPU meme
okay superhero there's no proper
overclocking guide there trust me
got the 8700 K no clue what's safe
overwhelming bios options yeah you kind
of have to look per board basically
overclocked on that does have great
guides the
dan I think we're unstable on this one
builds ID so those timings might not be
stable or the 101 be CLK I can try boost
voltage I guess maybe try voltage we've
seen
okay so this is gonna let's restart this
and do a 1.36
voltage otherwise I'll drop B CLK down
and then we should still beat them
anyway but I'd like to beat them in a
more significant fashion it's more fun
super-close 8080 something we're trying
to be 1892 I think it's very close come
on unlock
let's try one point three six five I
don't know what kind of temperature
we're probably probably pushing our
limits here with with thermals in this
room
remind me close these windows later okay
outside is significantly cooler
I'm opening windows so that we drop the
room temperature it'll help it
definitely need to close that later okay
that will help a bit
damn that already drop temperature over
there
okay so couple more points to gain back
anyone who's curious so we did some
tuning of timings with builds right
earlier and I asked him what do we need
to know about T Fogg TF aw which is one
of the time and she had us change and he
just gave me an answer so that answer
says Tifa equals four active window this
is the time this is the time window in
which four activates are allowed the
same rank TR Rd another one we modified
specifies the length of an activate so
for T fo equals TR RDS times four for
max performance so that's how we came to
those numbers and I'll plug them again
actually hardcore overclocking if you
want to check them out build Zoid does
some contract work with us on PCB
analysis and stuff like that alright so
scored a beat again 80 92 if we want to
go for five it's 81 38 we're not gonna
get past that I don't think without
better cooling or a better card so this
this one I should have really just run
the CPU tests even stable I guess but
might as well let it go at this point
this one will determine if we need to
drop that BC okay or pump the voltage a
bit spin out if we're at our limits or
not and let me check chat
the last bench I actually finished I
restarted it it froze I don't think it
did can't you just use it air
conditioning yeah yeah we're using using
like global air right now open the
windows helping a lot actually
at least with how I feel in this room I
don't know how about the system
superhero kife says there's no I got
that one
sneaky board this would be a great time
to talk about how good that pixie or
monitor is PS wins that fan tunnel video
coming weird I missed posting I hate
this monitor and I've been looking more
to the fan stuff we have equations for
calculating CFM now so basically where I
need to be I need to establish a
standardized bench for the host platform
I need to figure out how far we're going
with thermal testing on it because that
adds a million variables I was
considering building a custom thermal
test rig which would take time but we
have the equations sorted for CF family
calculations based on LPM so we're
getting there next one the army won 2-6
why don't you and could you start
reviewing fan tax cases I love them and
they are super good
I don't know they can email me I guess
we tried to meet up with them at one of
the events recently but they didn't have
time in their median schedule for us so
they don't sample us I'm not aware of
what their new products are because they
don't keep me in the loop so by the time
I hear about it's normally old news the
last one we looked at wasn't a great
case though that's not to say they don't
make great cases but I wouldn't apply a
blanket statement to any company if they
make good stuff I would say this
particular stuff is good buy them for
any company not just fan thanks
all right so we're just trying to see if
this is stable on CPU which is about to
run we'll find out in a few seconds
probably and then we shall know if we
need to drop down that VC okay
trying to catch up on super chat
okay so Zara says it go Steve destroy a
lioness hashtag rip LTT well to get this
table first so I think we're gonna drop
that B CLK back down to a hundred and
that should be sufficient
within margin of error of running the
test I might be able to push the GPU
clock a couple more megahertz which
should secure us the last couple of
points we need
just need to get into BIOS okay so we're
gonna drop BC okay to 100 from 101 and
then we're gonna drop this 1.36
for V Corps I'm gonna save that yeah
builds ID says drop BC okay I think
that'll be sufficient to at least get
the score we want store miss says here's
a small donation to the GN yeah he got
that one horse table for table fund rib
hashtag Clint says hashtag rip LT t
succeed and I'll sign up for patreon
well now we have motive didn't have any
before Anthony not much but a thank you
love your stuff Thank You Anthony
monkey chips you got this hashtag rip LT
t yeah here's to lose the TT mouse one
saw that okay it's booting center- do
you core temps of sixty degrees Celsius
plus on a closed-loop liquid cooler
automatically mean permeation will occur
because the water block is just
millimeters from the twos so the liquid
temperature sensors are within the water
block and we have some videos of tear
downs so they are their innate Sutekh
coolers they're basically just above the
cold plate and the chamber that liquid
goes through through the cold plate
micro fins there above that chamber I
think on the intake so that warmest
water coming in and at sixty degrees
Celsius you are facing permeation danger
but it's not like hitting 60 C will
instantly jeopardize your loop if it's
60 C for a prolonged period than yes if
if you're just kind of using your system
you're gaming for an hour and at the end
of it you're like oh man my liquid
temperatures we're 65 you're probably
completely fine you might have a minor
amount of permeation but we're talking
more one that's a somewhat conservative
number that ace that gives to
you need to be running out sixty c-plus
for a while to have a meaningful amount
of permeation obviously you keep it
lower than that sixty degrees I'm like
with temperatures actually is pretty
damn high so to get there to begin with
indicates a problem elsewhere like the
fan speed or something what would happen
to a GPS CPU Ram with an OC that is
stable but no voltage has been added
approximately speaking with degradation
be sped up how much if any would
lifespan be affected no voltage has been
added so so a higher higher frequency is
what I think you're saying but not a
higher voltage voltages are what kill
parts or degrade them if you're just
running the highest frequency that your
stock will just can handle you're
probably fine but there are motherboards
that will be overzealous on how much
voltage they apply we've talked about
them before gigabyte had one and they
fixed it thankfully it's not a deadly
voltage but auto voltage sometimes will
allow you to sustain higher clocks then
perhaps Auto voltage should because
they're aggressive on it and the voltage
tables are aggressive and the LLC tables
are aggressive and things like that but
if you're not increasing your voltage
you should be fine within reason
Christopher gave 25 PHP that Philips
Philippines or something thank you
appreciate it
Troy Leonard ltte is crying in Canada
smoke him like smoke um like I my board
Travis mounted block to stabilize the
vrm on overclocked more think of erm is
fine it's under the EVGA
yeah that VR I'm definitely fine the
heatpipes not even hot to the touch
no that's fine it's it's under like the
maxed out dark EVGA dark motherboard
fans so and we've done thermal testing
on that it's it's well within spec so we
actually don't it yeah we don't really
need it I claim the CPUs horizon 3 caddy
ray heart awesome OC for a 486 what GPU
GeForce 256 oh it's the it's the
original IGP that's what we're doing Dan
cop may stop with overclocking
completely he posted something like this
on his Facebook page I did not see that
Bjorn sent the super chat that noted
that I didn't I was not aware of that
see ya so we're just waiting for this to
finish I really should have run CPU only
test but we'll do that next time if it
crashes
have you considered testing SSDs yes
we've sort of done as st tested for the
longest time I was trying to build a
really solid SSD test bench but it's
it's really difficult to test them
properly and I was never quite happy
with our test suite for it even talking
with manufacturers I just never was
happy with it
so we basically said we've got a limited
amount of resources being mostly time
but also money but mostly time and after
investigating it heavily for on and off
for two years talking to people at every
trade show about SSD testing basically
said you know what we don't need to do
this we'll focus our efforts on GPU CPU
cooling stuff that I know I'm not afraid
to try and become competent in SSD
testing but it's pretty complex to do it
properly and I know enough to say that I
don't know enough to review SSDs right
now I would refer you to alan melvin
tano as SSD reviews his are some of the
best I've seen he writes for PC per so
that's that's where I would go for it
but I I have no intention of competing
in that market right now we have things
we do more competently than that
aisa snoozy to sunny board okay where
did I park my renault clio on 25 I have
no idea I don't know where you parked
I'm like Microsoft god dammit he's
serious eighty ninety one score to be
eighty ninety two okay so we're within
margin of error this benchmark didn't
take so long to finish it wouldn't be as
bad eighty ninety one man
okay
yeah video scheduler all right so it
doesn't like starting that test right
away you did more of a need or more of a
break to calm down chats blowing up -
have the Canadian winter for advantage
temperatures Tommy Crosby says
absolutely
I don't know how cool that warehouse is
but if you run it out in the snow you'd
have an advantage it's sort of exotic
cooling 1890 we're one point away 63c
rip LDT Lowell xddddd mate you got this
ciub lat
thank you disturbed it medic says hey
Steve early celebratory gifts for
beating minus one point away but thank
you anyway we'll get their shots go in
so many FS and cherry now ffffff
can't can't can't script it better than
that though oh and you just pointed out
a hundred dollar donation there's a lot
I'll read it in a second
thank you though in advance
hand me that hair dos try to gauge
another 40 points yeah basically spray
it into the rads at this point but
turning off the monitor can prove the
sport now I don't think so
that was from Kwik shop previous one was
from motors motor motor sport Alexi says
say I want to put four of those crazy
Titans in a loop with ek WB 560 rads is
that a reasonable idea what are you
doing I guess that's the question if
you're doing some kind of computer or
deep learning thing that doesn't need to
bridge them with envy length and I guess
the hell better be making money off of
it if you're spending that kind of money
that is 12 grand on Titan V's the guy
who B says can we see somewhere out of
the box than all this think you're
seeing it right now bill on cello
something in Russian moneybags hey love
your content I've gotten 8700 K at five
point three gigahertz one point four
three volts is that voltage fine that's
a great frequency coins fine don't want
the voltage to degrade it too quickly
you're okay if you can bring it down
great but I think you're okay I don't
know how that is for daily we use
voltages similar to that
check your LC make sure the LSE is not
blowing it up or pushing it past what
you think it is because that matters
what do you think about Peltier tech
cooling from Hayden we tried testing a
phase change cooler at some point phonon
ik or something I think what's the name
of it it did not perform well it was
like a 92 millimeter cooler and it
performed like other 92 millimeter
coolers so we tried it but I would need
something better than that
let's see hundred dollars what was your
message why can't I see it
okay we'll get there I guess Oh someone
didn't say the last test did not crash
it went three zoltes just as you hit the
reset button for the previous one I
guess
oops Andrew crew is always prefer out of
the house terminal Z that's what we're
using right now that the windows open
Dreier spider dreary or spider says have
you considered test I got that one SSDs
rave $5 you can find autosave - 3d mark
results in Documents folder might want
to check to see where that last round
really completed ok mine yeah well if
this one's better than who cares well
they also measure static pressure this
is relating to the phantasm we have ways
to sort of show that but I'll talk about
that more when it's time we're gonna be
testing against various radiators and
filters jonathan Brumfield what is your
thoughts on the thermal take water 3.0
performer a iOS I'm not familiar with
them well you have a big water I don't
think we have the one you're referring
to so yeah sorry I don't know Samuel
Kaufman mod map backward hashtag riff
ldt thank you for back ordina hey mod
matt that store that gamers next has
done that certainly appreciate it it
helps a lot
kayo says a great video hashtag rip LT
TPS these are Brazilian rays don't check
the exchange rate ok I got 5 of those I
don't know if the exchange rate is mmm
way hundred dollars no message well
thank you Emily we that's that's
extremely generous of you and it's
absolutely appreciated hopefully
hopefully this bench heard all of those
super chats and we'll put on a show
because if it doesn't it's going out the
window
gear seekers anyone else noticed Steve
has a legs from the H 500 P video yeah I
guess that's probably one of the fewer
you see below the table okay bazinga axe
can you recommend a good barber no wow
how did you ask I'm busted hashtag get
the water bucket
okay how are we doing here a couple
seconds I think it needs to be 892 or
better it needs to be better than 89 it
needs to be 89 you through here better
there's 80 90 one last time everyone
hold your breath
come on what is it
there we go boom okay within margin of
error beaten Linus tech tips there at 80
92 right 80 99 I might try and push that
a bit harder but just just to solidify
it for now until they go crazy but I
would like to at least solidify that so
cool
yeah 80 99 let's go over the numbers
here seven six seven six on the graphics
score 11 7 8 5 on the CPU score and
anything else we need to note here well
yeah 80 99 here so let's validate if it
will let me I definitely need to take
screenshots for Hardware BOTS there we
go valid score that's what I want to see
okay how quickly does this website
update
times by extreme one graphics card the
update already know either way we're in
here between them 80 99 I'm gonna take a
screenshot for Hardware bot as well and
that's gonna require opening a bunch of
stuff and then then we'll go for the
next score chat let's see a chat saying
hashtag rip LTT going crazy everyone
tweet at Linus tech I think it is and
and - geez Sebastian tweet up those
accounts hashtag rip LTT something else
on our rekt or something okay see
tell him to respond tell him come at me
I'd love to see them respond in the way
only Linus and team could and then we'll
return fire and keep the friendly media
battle going give me a second to open
all this stuff and I I'm gonna go for
five well push for a little longer
go for five we're not too far and see
how that goes
otherwise we'd always come back and do
another stream and push for five need
mainboard speed memory CPU mainboard
this is all the stuff for her turbot she
Jersey
okay this thing down here somewhere
this year all right I think that's
everything
all right
cool okay so I'm gonna push that GPU
clock I we haven't had a crash yet right
no we had a crash launch from GPU let's
push it a little higher and see what it
does
especially now that room temperature is
a bit lower so let's go I don't know
what the increments are on this thing
what was it 75 it's only like 25
megahertz increments but let's see if
light 115 does it for us how about this
what's the minimum increment on this I
think that's 25 also but we'll see no
that worked okay so 85 115 let's see if
that crash is instantly or not and
disconnect this sighs now believe it
connected okay Ron okay let's see we get
five have you done the Shaun mod yet yes
it is on there presently as already on
there
okay so we're going for five now I
thought it just crashed hunt for five I
don't know if we'll get it I'm happy
with six be happier with five okay
Zynga and I got that one get the water
bucket got that one
Philip see 1600 X at 3.8 gigahertz one
point two six three volts a be 350 an
h-60 a IO hitting 70 to C and pub G
thoughts on those temps is that TDI or
is that T control Verizon there's two
temperature numbers there's T dying
there's T control C control has a
temperature offset it will artificially
increase the number that's reported to
you TDI is the one that you want that's
more or less the real temperature and
see my phone's getting blown up that's
that's the temperature you want to look
for Evie J's YouTube channel apparently
popped into the chat earlier Patrick
says was moderating team EVGA posted in
chat hashtag lnto if you're still there
jacob king pin 10 any of you i invite
you to visit us
BYO ln2 and we'll do it nah not really
sure the parameters are for getting that
through TSA but I'll bail you out
seriously they'll bring it with you do
something or or I'll get some in and you
guys come out we'll do it
alright other messages
they launched our congrats GN team had
fun watching the stream thank you very
much
took us a while but we got there waffle
Ferg did LT t got that score when he
took a wall ACN and shoved it in a
cooler it helped lots of congratulations
messages Lord dryer ed Novak 20 bucks
thank you very much Adam says should
someone do a claymation someone should
do a claymation Celebrity Deathmatch a
la MTV with Steve and - congrats on the
win
MXC a 909 we're still stable over here
cool said great work Thank You Troy
Leonard winner winner chicken dinner
great job Steve have a nice cold beer
hashtag rip LTTE
okay so if we're trying to go over five
and I think we're gonna stop there
80 138 is a score to beat let me check
what their CPU scores are on things like
that that is by deserve he's submitted
from the US there see twerp we're way
past their cpu score there are ten seven
four six so we're good there their GPA
score is 7800 quite a bit higher we'll
see how this does maybe Daniel
Napolitano says did you take the sticker
off the CP no it's had a reference to
the one didn't did - leave the sticker
on the cold plate I think he did someone
did knew it wasn't him oh is junior
right let's J we did take the sticker
off rip LT t here's some south of
Vitoria tacos okay so so uh from the
donations tonight after this coffee
tacos fried chicken x - there's
something else - beer okay
thank you thank you for for dinner I
guess
we'll Linus drop the gauntlet like he
does hardware oho
how does it good one well served I hope
so probably okay kind of holding my
breath on this and we'll see how close
we get to number five that's the number
we're going for now
Christopher Donald 10 bucks thank you
very much for the super chat donation
Christopher can you please talk about
thermal results Fuji poly pads on the
vrm alone who's been asking you yeah
we're working on it I actually bought a
ton of thermal pads
we'll get there Dane that was a big jump
I wasn't even trying to sandbag what is
that 81 38 what we were trying to beat
we just did 82 15 by accident okay cool
so we're number five now why are they
saying 3dmark crashed now I've made it I
think I made it though 3dmark sites down
is it really
I think it is down hopefully we can
still validate how that happened okay
well anyway we're certainly not driving
well maybe we are I don't know I I
wouldn't think we're driving enough
traffic to do that but maybe we are okay
so anyway let's show that let's show the
screen because those sites down sorry
so hopefully you guys can see this okay
I think their sites down is still
spinning for me so this is not updated
we were eleventh when we started today
at 76 88 and then we placed a score of
80 91 which put us here
- was 80 92 with the help of build Zoid
and also margin of error we ended up at
80 99 which would put us in here not
updated yet serve is number five 81 38
we beat serves CBO score but at the time
not the GPU score and now I think we're
very close to the GB score I don't think
we're ahead of it we're at 7800 GPU 11
769 CPU so we passed this we're at 82 15
which it's pretty close to 4 let's see
what forest results are that was the
site back up I just realized I guess the
site's back up ok cool
so ok scores I don't even know what I'm
doing anymore 77 91 12 5 8 9 so they've
it was this even this person has a lot
on us and CP score gunslinger but what
was the GPU score 77 91 maybe we can
make it up in GPU we haven't found the
limit yet so 8215 let's try and validate
this online come on
in a validate yes okay we validated
excuse me for a moment while I open up a
thousand cpu-z tabs for hardware bots
and then we're gonna try and begun
Slater who is number four and presently
has 82 63 we're at 82 15 I don't know
how much Headroom we have left
okay I'm just opening a ton of these for
for Hardware bot where we'll submit our
scores and then we're also validated on
3d marks website where Linus validated
what I'd love to see is is some more
media getting into this because a lot of
fun and I think media presence in the OC
space would do a lot of good for the
overclocking scene and it's good for
viewers so I'd love to see more of that
but okay let's get our screen shot
okay it says invalid sport it not work
compare results online why does it say
invalid score sport is not bad
Oh results is already present okay can't
upload it twice so it is about it just
says we can't upload it twice so we're
good there
okay let's see if we have anything left
in this GPU before it starts crashing
driver crashing and blue screen
125 I don't know if 90 will even apply
or if that's too small of an increment
931 did not apply let's just leave it
there and see what that does
well you know what now it's let's save
everyone some time let's try a hundred I
think we're gonna crash we'll try a
hundred there I'm pretty sure we'll
crash here and 125 on the core okay see
if it crashes instantly or not I mean
chat back up so we're going for number
five at this or no number four we took
five took five I don't think the site's
updated yet but we should have five okay
wobble wobble yes sorry all right mr.
Giggs have you used a fractal node 804
case thoughts I have not I have not used
it we are doing some mini ITX stuff
though I think most of it just came in
hasn't crashed yet
we'll see graphics - isn't only where it
fails for me which is gonna be the next
one hashtag Steve 2020 yeah
$2 thank you David Wooten $2 much
appreciated I have a lot to catch up on
here thank you for the super chats
everyone lured dryer at hardware unboxed
nice to see you in here welcome hardware
unbox Steve Gargoyle names a Lexington
my mom likes your hair appreciate it
Philip see two British pounds 72 degrees
Celsius and a vrm hit 76 due to the mini
RB 0 1 e if you're in if this is related
to the question how thermals earlier rvz
0 1 e is that that's the small case if
you're at 72 and 76 I'd be pretty happy
with that assuming assuming your
questions when I was talking about
earlier that was asking about over
thermals for an overclock because that's
a tiny case if I remember correctly
two dollars Mohamed probably the only
viewer from Algeria a hashtag Gianna
multinational you might be and we
appreciate your presence it looks like
this will not pass so we can bring down
HBM and see if the Corps will hold I'm
not positive which one caused the crash
but I do want to go for four while we're
so close
we're stable at 80 just put that at 80
leave the core at 125 see if that works
okay it's still cooling down the coolant
is getting warm now so we'll see we'll
see how it does every couple degrees if
you're not familiar with alte every
couple degrees matters it's like five
degree increments you've gained or these
clocks towards the bottom end of the
scale you're talking like 12 megahertz
at a time but 84 degrees is a big
thermal hit that drops your clocks
heavily 60 degrees is a big barrier that
also impacts your clocks heavily if you
get down to like 59 and below your
boosted over if you're at 60 and above
it's how boost 3.0 works and it keeps
going down pretty far I think it might
be as low as 13 12 or 13 degrees
something like that
Brent Lewis well done $20 thank you
Brent's appreciate it Peter Eyre can you
show the autographed Gian Matt might
pick one up we can get a photo of one I
I need them to come in the new round to
come in we did some last time I need the
next round to come in to sign them
though but we have a to a photo okay
so too much too much for it so 1:15 we
were stable I don't know we might let's
let's go back to 1:15 and let's go up to
a hundred and see if that's stable
maybe it's the clot the core that's
tripping us and if not we can try some
stuff with the CPU and then we'll call
it quits if that doesn't work I'm still
plenty happy with slot number five for
now
you put liquid in the fridge and pour it
in we could have condensation issues
not only a king Bennett flew out for
Jays video would be awesome for Ilya to
do the same for you Ilya I believe
they're referring to 10 as he's known he
is uh he's one of the engineers at EVGA
he works in I think the same lab as
kingpin we've been in that lab it's
really cool fun trivia or fun fact I
guess the lab kingpin works out of it
has so it's got the huge L&amp;amp;T tanks as
you'd expect has also got kind of a loop
hooked up so basically the if I remember
correctly the L&amp;amp;T comes straight out of
the tank goes to the component and it's
not really like an open loop or a closed
loop cooler it looks like one though so
it visually it looks like closed loop
liquid nitrogen cooler it's really damn
cool they have a they have a good test
setup as you'd expect but I will be out
there again when we're in Taiwan for
Computex later this year mmm end of May
June I think
first week of June we'll be there
probably visit EVGA okay
Justin Parrish phase-change
refrigeration and ln2 from Linus you
he'll see that be what I'd expect from
Bill and Chavo do you read any books
I've read Stephen Kane
not in a long time most recently
basically GPU architecture book Gonzo's
twin here's $10 here's some batter and
blood for the celebratory breakfast
tomorrow have some pancakes and the
blood of your enemies
aka maple syrup on me thank you
this is maple syrup a euphemism for
Linus here because he's Canadian their
total wind up $2 thoughts on NVIDIA GTX
GTX what at RT x GD x what is DG o DG X
maybe DG x the research thing I don't
have many thoughts on its way out of my
coverage spectrum I'm not really
qualified to talk about it if I remember
correctly it's just a big like cloud
computing box of some kind no thoughts
at all on that sorry
build Zoids messaging me gunslinger okay
guns then just score Oh hardware bar
there you go okay
it's thoughts on that changes asking
builds oh he ran on Ellen - apparently
so that's part of why he's destroying
our score in the CPU Department looks
like it's passing hbm's higher this time
hopefully that actually matters with
this benchmark I don't remember anymore
mattered with fire strike char comes and
Friends five dollars well done sir Steve
thank you char guns
think char comes has a stream coming up
on like the 24th there's something we've
retweeted a few times I gave him a
couple of like GN basically shirts swag
stuff to give away on a stream I think
that's on the 24th search for shark
comes on Twitter if you want to win one
of the G on things I gave them Brandon
have you seen the ghost s one modular
MITx case I have not let's lift it up
ghost s one modular MITx case sepia is
running so we made it past the hard part
ghost s one that looks very compact
that's crazy
we I don't know I can try and get in
touch with them it's like barely taller
than a red ball can apparently based on
their photos Justin Murphy spray it with
coolers and duster turned upside down no
I'm not gonna do that
thermals are not limiting us right now
skills limiting us and so is the GPU
skills limiting us on the CPU and the
memory but I've got builds way to
helping a bit at this point okay what is
it I don't have the server to the left
dan80 222 all that for like eight points
seven points 82 twenty-two is pretty
good so gunslingers got us beat right
now builds orde says I think he's doing
some calculations in order to beat
gunslinger and take forth we would need
a 7850 GPU score where 50 points away
from that and an eleven thousand eight
hundred cpu score that's what we would
need so we're 44 points away on the GPU
and we're 26 points away on the CPU or
not nothing not even 16 16 points away
on the CPU so I don't know we'd try and
push 49 let's do that I guess before we
give up let's push 249 on the on two
cores see what that does for us and then
we can try a little bit more on the GPU
my restart button has broken thank you
windows
as a used command prompt to shutdown all
right I think we're plugging in a
battery on the camera too not too much
longer on this guy's but I do want to
see if we can get to that that last slot
the could oxygen to OC Zack B thank you
for the $2 Oh Tom Bowens 94 did I miss
it no okay
how does the mat handle snags like cat
claws she hasn't so flake hasn't tried
to scratch it up surprisingly cats
destroyed friggin everything they
touched though so I'm not gonna
guarantee my mat against it against cats
it's a losing battle it holds up very
well to screwdrivers that's part of what
we invested our newer development
efforts on was making sure you can hold
the scratches durability is much better
than on our original sample which is the
one that I have but not the one that
shipping so original sample was very
vibrant but not very durable we've
improved the durability a lot and for
this next run we're working on improving
the vibrance as well which we've done
some tricks like changing the background
to black which increased brings out the
contrast a bit following feedback from
some of the early adopters thank you to
those of you who provided that and yeah
so it holds up very well now and the
actually always for retail samples and
the contrast should be better for the
next round which is great we're pretty
happy with it already but working on
improving it as we go because this is
our first real product ok 3d mark
and if you're curious about it I'll
state against where that game is Nexus
dotnet the mod mat is what I was just
talking about okay so I pushed 449 on to
of course we're just gonna run the CPU
test and see if it crashes and we're at
100 here we're at 115 here we might be
able do 125 on the HBM see if it crashes
and see if it overheats
just CPU so we're going for numbers for
we already passed - if you're just
getting here or have you forgotten and
he was at 80 92 we passed that we're at
like 80 82 1580 222 something like that
and now we're going for 82/63 which is
gunslingers score so that is a that's
the score to be 82/63 according to build
Lloyd's calculations from actually
hardcore overclocking we need a 7850 GPS
score in 11800 cpu score and he's
reminding me that GPA score is way way
more important than CPU four times by
extreme so that's where we really need
to make up ground if we're gonna
actually get there without chilling it
or something I don't know
we're kind of the max but let's just see
if we can pull something out of the CPU
for for that 7800 that we need we're at
49 on to around 4 of the cores I think
four yeah something like that
okay chat what's chats and Bill and
Charla two dollars we're building
something great yes we are times by
scores Trey Coleman the msi a B unlock a
voltage slider to gain access to higher
clock speed bins you can utilize it due
to the card being shunt modded I mean
I'll try it
the in my experience the voltage slider
doesn't actually do anything but I'll
certainly give it a shot so that wasn't
stable let's fix that first
I'll give you your suggestion a shot but
the voltage slider itself is really just
like a placebo but maybe I think you're
talking about different bins those that
might be different
so we need to drop those clocks back
down a bit
okay let's go 48 48 leave those alone
so it was semi stable
wishbone $2 a c.strick sandy free sink
two monitors out yet I actually don't
know I haven't heard of free sink to
very much since CES 2017 I think gage
Lindell says get number four and I'll PI
Ahmad Matt that's right
swing life away rise against reference
says will multi diet GPUs comes a pro
soon professional or a consumer first I
don't know Navi is doing it soon so I
have I'm not sure genuinely I would
assume professional use but I would
think some kind of like now the V 100
example if you die yeah I don't know my
money would be on Navi being one of the
first to market but we'll see what
NVIDIA has up and sleep okay
so first let's do a validation of if if
the previous if the new settings are
stable for 49 for the first two cores
and then I'm gonna save this profile
this time okay you know we're gonna do
the I will do that next we'll do that
voltage unlock the next see if that bin
is actually gonna help her if it's it
matters at all I think we're pretty
close to our limits here though
82/63 guns later a real Eric Locker in
this class unlike Linus and myself so
we're up against heavy weights now
I think he was Alan to you on a sunday
980 oxy and had it over five gigahertz
all right
so we have Bob this area $1 thank you
Bob
okay bill on cello $2 just join the
stream what cpu are you running you know
bill when you use the same username to
post that question about five times we
catch on
was it not stable thank 79
it's a 79 80 XE I actually haven't
managed to change it via quantum
teleportation trying to drop that back
down push GPU up a bit see hey Moll
Patel he novotel 20 bucks hey Steve you
emailed me when I drunk bought 2 mod
mats by accident use this money to buy
some ice and chill those rads you got
this thank you yeah I saw the second
order come in shortly after the first
order and we ended up changing it to
just one Matt because apparently drunk
purchased the second one I caught it and
was like that's a different behavior but
we do appreciate the $20 okay alright I
think we're getting towards the last try
here just gonna push that GPU see what
it does
Schuyler Wallis $5 speaking of rise
against what music do you listen to you
rise against Bad Religion Parkway Drive
Trivium what else what other what other
metal stuff there's so much made an
occasionally protest the hero is really
good it's a couple of BT Bam's pretty
good o paths good
would be most of it I guess rise against
as well some rap depending on how hard
I'm trying to destroy Linus's score in
3d mark alright afterburner Hilltop
Hoods are good let's not so good
POC okay so what was that setting we
were looking for I'm dragging this over
here so I can see it
it's the unlock voltage doesn't do
anything what will do it anyway I mean
it might it might do been stuff but the
actual slider is basically placebo okay
let's just try 125 here one more time I
don't think we're gonna get this one but
I'll do separately after the stream if I
submit a bunch of scores for fire strike
and stuff to you on the stale settings
we have
Alexander Stiles $5 you should check out
the deer hunters act 4 and Coheed zakat
Apollo vol 1 if you have and I actually
haven't heard them already I will do
that someone else just told me to check
out tooth grinder earlier
CJ Hansen hashtag give it all and yes
that is a reference yes that is great
reverence that's the first rise against
song I heard lure dryer I'm glad you
don't play metal on here not my music
Chandra ok thank you for the 50
Norwegian planet vampire calm why does
Steve it use Pantheon and when he
already has such finesse that the puns
the puns is it going to be stable I
think crash on graphics to last time
food after this yes we can go to the
only place that's open
how about industrial kfdm skinny puppy
front line assembly actually don't not
because I don't like it just cuz I don't
really venture over there hey if I used
to listen to like every day I still like
a if I have seen them live a lot and
rise against I've seen live a lot Linkin
Park I saw I have a couple times if I
there what the hell is their album and
shoot I forget what it is they kind of
want industrial on one of their reason
not they're not the blood album but the
one before that burials yeah they kind
of want industrial a little bit but no
not really
to answer your question okay
did crash I think it crashed same spot
alright I think that's probably all
we're gonna push it for now so well do
next is you know while we're I guess
this won't take long
we'll just run the stable settings we
have hopefully still stable I don't know
hopefully it stable I guess it's a bit
different with fire strike isn't it but
let's just do a time spy run submit that
non-extreme and we'll do fire strikes
with that fire strike extreme and maybe
I'll tune them off-camera later but I
think that'll get us some scores on
database for now go on cello $2 buy some
McDonald's with this huge donation thank
you well so now this is this recap let's
recap the stream donations which we very
much appreciate how long we've been
streaming do you know three hours or
something it's 1006
now two and a half hours either way
something like two and a half hours over
that period we've gotten donations for
fried chicken for coffee for beer for
McDonald's hahahaha Hey
tacos thank you that I really appreciate
it
lower dryer I think this will be my last
one think you can look think you can try
to look up how much you've made in total
on the stream before ending PSP the work
that I don't know that I get to see that
until the stream ends yeah I'm not sure
I don't see anything on here it's it's I
mean it's decent amount like it
definitely here's the thing streaming's
big toss up because if if you don't get
the views and the either indirect
revenue which would be things like merge
sales or direct revenue which would be
things like super chat what you're doing
they don't tend this one notwithstanding
don't tend to get as many views as the
normal videos so ad revenue is gonna be
lower placed ads will be will serve
fewer views so to really make it work we
need to get something out of the stream
from a brand perspective so like
establishing that hey that you can come
here and see a different kind of stream
do some overclock and stuff like that
and also bring in hopefully some
additional revenue through things like
patreon store super chat I don't know
what we've gotten but it's it looks like
it's it's made up for the fact that
streaming is expensive in terms of what
we could do instead not expensive in
terms of equipment because it's mostly
the same equipment the setup expense is
a couple hours not too bad well this one
took a bit more but the the fact that
over the course of a stream plus setup
we could film one or two other videos
that's where you factor in the the
business side of things so yeah it helps
appreciate it absolutely appreciate you
especially lower drier the whole time
looks like it's going through so that's
time spy not extreme I don't know we
might be able push GPU higher but I'm
not gonna bother at this point we're
just gonna submit the score as it is
time spy will behave differently than
extreme I don't even remember if we're
at 4.9 on two cores anymore I've kind of
lost track
okay answer that and stay fashionable
good reference
that's from supervillain next what
Mustaine's by matt $2 mousetrap for the
wooden bow strat so the Parks and Rec
right Parks and Rec reference hammer
slap $5 I see 19 thumbs down isn't that
exactly how many employees Linus has
pretty damn close think you're onto
something
let's get some heavy music fans in the
chat
Harley Clarke thank you Zann Cruz I like
turtles it's one of my favorite bands
actually abuse nab use it $5.00 Jesus to
get some salad to stay healthy
okay so they don't say and healthy is I
don't think after you how do you pull
all the things you've all told us to eat
tonight
you put a salad on top of it I don't
think that's how staying healthy works
but I will certainly try it so we're
trying to get everyone anyone who's
trickled in or out we're at 82 22 four
times five extremely we passed - a long
time ago we passed serve I think I'm not
familiar with serve they may well pass
us I don't know if our score is updated
yet 82 22 I think is what it was and we
tried to pass gunslinger briefly can't
quite do it we'll need more tuning or
different parts so we'll leave it there
for time spike stream there's a times by
normal non extreme just to place a score
with it and we'll do fire strike and
then close it out techsoup jiggle the
handle turn it up to 11
thank you for the $2 yoni benny oni buy
a song with this you hear all that
remains I have heard all that remains
what did I hear by them
I don't know what I listened to by them
oh they just cycled through in my
youtube like recommended thing once I
think that's where I saw all that
remains I haven't really listened to
them to be honest
Dominic Pham last hurrah yeah basically
CJ Hansen for nine give it all as my
fave all-time favorite I keep it all as
great John guy $20 smashed the hat mucho
love we ready
we already smashed Linus I think he'll
you'll get back to us though
throw some island to island or something
Zzyzx wolf make LTT cry like an anime
fan on prom night
ouch two dollars cracks dill mill used
1093 voltage frequency points Oh see I
get what you're saying I I think we're
probably a bit past that point in terms
of in terms of like tiredness and things
like that I don't even know how this
score compares at this point but let's
take a look now we're not connected to
the Internet that would help so I don't
know where we're gonna place on this one
c'mon
tell im
okay let me just pull it up on the other
machine so we're looking at times by not
extreme for one GPU oh there it goes
okay one GPU a times by normal the site
is going so slow three marks crazy slow
right now still loading guys I don't
know how we actually compare right now
result is hit and I'm guessing because
their website seems to be down that's
annoying okay times pi LTTE all right
save that one invalid score probably cuz
I couldn't submit now already exists
okay so it's already up apparently three
mark websites still not responding stop
breaking 3d mark okay
so 15 494 if anyone can get the 3d
market result that wait that's gonna
cause a problem any of you get the 3d
mark results page to load for the Hall
of Fame page sorry click on times by not
extreme and then click on 1x and then
tell me where 15 4 9 4 lands on that
chart because I can't get their site to
load any more and I don't think what I
just said will help it anyway we got
that one I saved it for now not like we
can't do it again later let's just run a
fire strike extreme and then I'll stop
there if we want to do others will do
them off camera
Sally last one if I even get it little
load let me know
all right super chats Joseph Kahn if you
had to guess
will the 1180 or whatever they call it
be as fast as a Titan V I maybe hmm I
don't know maybe a TI I don't think so
fourth that doesn't sound right
fourth spot multiple people's no one
person said fourth is that really true
be nice if I could load their website is
the mod Mac compatible as mouse pad so
on the store page for the mod mat
technically it says not intended for use
as a mouse pad it's meant as a service
for modding components anti-static costs
more as a result than a mouse pad would
the material has sort of a rougher
texture to it it's I would put it
between a smooth Mouse surface and like
the rough aluminum side of a Razer matte
aluminum at so it's in between those in
terms of roughness I've been using it as
a mousepad this whole time it's not
intended to be use that way if you are
highly sensitive and really wants to
move the services then no buy a mousepad
if you're okay with a bit of texture
then it seems to work fine for these I'm
not a competitive eSports player though
so I can't speak to the high-end but
anyway 1180 I don't think it'll I don't
know what I can tell you my guess for
the next gaming generation is and I
guess I mean I'm I'm almost 100%
positive Nvidia I'm fairly confident is
shifting some of its focus to to DirectX
12 and Vulcan
we've been streaming for a while I'm
kind of losing words at this point what
am I looking for here shoot been
streaming away too long anyway
DirectX 12 and Vulcan o out of order
processing so they're going that
direction or more asynchronous compute
that's what I was looking for
asynchronous compute DirectX 12 Vulcan
will be part of the more focused feature
set of the next generation as I
understand it today the Titan V made
large strides specifically in games like
Sniper Elite 4 with asynchronous compute
and with DirectX 12 it didn't make us
big games and DirectX games in DirectX
11 there's less to gain and videos
already optimized there dx11 drivers a
lot and their focus appears to be going
more towards the asynchronous compute
stuff so
I can't answer your question where the
1180 will fall but in terms of
predicting the focus of performance I
think you'll see less of an uptrend on
dx11
and more of an uptrend in dx12 and
Vulcan specifically with asynchronous
are out of order processing that's what
I think is gonna happen next and I am
fairly confident in a lot of those
things I just said sways $5 Pepto Bismol
after all of the food we're gonna have
to eat because of this dream validated
because your internet-connected okay so
their site still down fire strike
extreme 1864 for I don't know where that
falls I don't know if it'll even let us
validate it 1864 for though the score
gråvik's 1887 eight physics 36,000
combined ten to thirty 10230 so that's
where we are for that Hayden protests
the heroes the yes they are really
good more proggy but really good okay
yeah so we're gonna save this one too I
don't know what's up mmm-hmm LT TFS
extreme okay so I think that'll close
out the benchmarks basically I'll let
this run while I I close out the stream
here but we really cup more of these as
Alex revisited my OC on 68 50k at four
point four at one point four one can't
seem to get the voltage any lower
suggestions for four point four and you
can't get the voltage lower check your
LLC settings it's possible that you're
putting in a number like one point four
one but if your LLC is not holding it
actually at what you're tying it to hold
it at and it's lower you might have some
more Headroom there if you increase your
LLC do it responsibly check the voltage
as you increase LLC because it's
possible that it'll it'll like blast the
voltage too high but just do a quick
check and and see what that gets you
that would be my starting point is LLC
Lord Dreyer nor the Norwegian kroner is
down today so my 350 NOK is only about
45 dollars today blame the recent
politicians sorry to hear bill on cello
what is that eggplant emoji Seminole
chief rip LTT hashtag slush falling from
the sky and Winston
yes family rip LTT we'll see what they
respond with wishbone two bucks thank
you your thoughts on Atari VCS and take
apart
Byun take apart we might I saw the news
announcement on it I don't know much
about it I need to ask Patrick I know he
had some thoughts on it he was doing
some work earlier for us sways $10 buy
some shims for that table I don't know
what to do at the table
Tyler whit 850 loved the vids keep them
up thank you what's that thing in the
background with your logo this this is a
side panel I have a power revolt too it
was one of our first ads we ever ran I
think during CES of like I don't know
maybe 2016 I want to say the I buy power
or evil to the small form-factor gaming
pc i still remember it because that was
like the first ad read i had to memorize
to say all show but they I actually I
liked the case it had a couple problems
but it was it was pretty good overall
because they did the only liquid coin so
thermals weren't as big of a concern
this brute force solution but they just
put like a vinyl wrap on the side panel
the guy the PM basically did that by
hand so we liked how it looked a lot
wanted to put on display it's been there
a while needs to be dusted Zeta before
you go $2 hey before you go I never
caught what CPU you have
so it's a 79 80 X e Intel shills Clint
Kern I was promised off to sign up for
patreon also by Ahmad Matt need a new
mousepad
Lal good job today thank you I
appreciate it a lot
we're looking at some mouse pads by the
way but we have a lot of other things in
progress right now okay fire strike I
think just finished so let me read
through the last ones of these tech
diode Linus deployed his bot against the
three mark site donation to stream all
the food you have to eat I think I was
drinking for now Thank You Vera Donovan
I 9 thank you appreciate it
Justin ad send $5 check out Circa
Survive and their album I'm letting go I
will add that to my list with the others
that you all have told me to check out
ok fire strike 30 2007 93 I'll save the
score GB score 37,000 physics for thirty
six thousand three hundred combined to
16 thousand so let's just save this as
LT t - FS and then I will submit that
once the website works again because you
know you guys are or Linus's people
broke it I don't know this one broke the
the site okay I'm not reading anymore
super chats after these two just to be
clear Luiz Gustavo have you ever seen
rainy days affecting the OC I had
problems in the past when trying to OC
interesting now I haven't I don't know
is it also warm on those days do you
have like a high room ambient or
something
HCC 148 say lames an airbrush sucks
that's my business okay last one
Mavericks racks can't afford the mod mat
so here's a donation to your glorious
channel thank you I appreciate it thank
you everyone for watching there's a lot
of fun to recap we beat Linus tech tips
for now on the time spy extreme charts I
think I said we're in fifth and we
passed serve I think we're behind
gunslinger we need to see what our
scores look like for the others might
need to optimize further for those
