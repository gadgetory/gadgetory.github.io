we posted some pretty high scores in
times 5 extreme by using an ice bucket
and chilling the radiator of our GPU and
CPU first time we've ever done that so
the process to get here was really long
we're gonna use the system one more time
in a live stream and that will be today
October 5th at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard
Time so make sure you check back for
that stream if you want to see this
thing in action one more time before we
start tearing it down but this video
will show you the build up process and
all of the pain that we went through to
get it working it was a first-time
experience for us learning how to
insulate cards using tricks from extreme
overclockers like build Zoid so that we
could get the cards in a state where we
weren't concerned about condensation
forming from the lower than ambient
cooling solution stuff like that so it's
a really interesting process if you want
to check it out but otherwise you can
see it in action again in the stream
assuming the stream hasn't already ended
by the time this is seen by you before
that this video is brought to you by it
the NZXT e series power supplies the e
series PS use our high end power
supplies with real time digital voltage
and temperature monitoring per rail
wattage measurements and data logging
functionality for power usage the e
series PSU is also come with a 10 year
warranty all the way down to the 500
watt unit and they run fully modular and
with silent fan operating modes learn
more at the link below so this is the
point where I'm gonna have to interrupt
my whole review cycle and scheduling
just to respond to J 1 mr. J is 2 cents
because when he beat our score on times
by extreme he posted a number that was
about a hundred points higher and we
beat that but and this was we didn't
make a video about it yet so I beat that
score God 100 points higher and the
changes I made to the bench to do that
involved actually there were no changes
it was just skill so with just about 8
hours of my time tuning timings and the
clocks and voltages and memory straps
and everything learning a lot about that
was he process we're able to get up and
beat J's score but then he posted
another one he's beaten us heavily in
graphic score right now which is what's
getting I'm the huge
jumping tse total points because time
spy extreme really cares about graphics
we're way behind in graphics for two
reasons the primary of which is a
thermal constraint so we've been running
this EVGA actually ultra for our primary
card which is a fine card but it's not
water-cooled and J at this point is on
water cooling and up before this point
when he beat us by a hundred points and
then I responded and beat that with just
skill he beat our score then by using an
AC unit hooked up to a duct pointed into
a cardboard box which he lives in and
then cooled his entire overclocking
system that way we are going to respond
by I guess putting water blocks on these
things even though it's kind of
inconvenient but hopefully there's a
one-shot deal so we're gonna put water
blocks on at least one card the hybrid
card we have sorry I said there are two
reasons that he's way ahead of us one is
the thermal constraint that's big on
these Nvidia cards if you can get down
to like 40 degrees Celsius that's
another voltage step-down you increase
your clock
7:13 a even 20 megahertz a big deal
there and we are at sixty plus on this
card and then about I want to say about
45 on the hybrid card so we have a lot
of headroom there we can gain by shaving
20 degrees off with water and then the
next reason we're a bit behind is
because of our founders addition card
that we're using for the secondary card
it only offsets memory by we got up to
nine thirty megahertz found a memory
strap there so we four four clocks we're
kind of limited on that one compared to
the partner cards but we have a solution
for that as well so hopefully avoiding
doing shot mods today but we do have a
plan for that as well if it comes down
to it for now though let's get into the
waterblock build up so first of all huge
shout out to our patreon backer Richie
who sent over this pile of stuff water
cooling stuff Jay has a major leg up on
us there and you'll see where that comes
in later but so we don't we don't have
years of liquid cooling parts like he
does so we had one of our patreon
backers who was also competing on the x
bar x buy listings send us some of his
and he's competing for a single card
Titan V score
but we're going duel card so all right
let's take this thing apart and get a
water block on it and then we can go
from there on what happens next we
really need to get that efi card out of
the equation it's a major major
bottleneck at this point and the EVGA
card has been a bit of a crutch for it
and the process of removing this thing
we've learned EVGA double stacked their
own pads a new VG I went crazy with
their old pads after a CX and icx and
everything this is going a little fart
she'd think anyway that's removed so
spacing was not perfect for that so we
are not gonna bother Reaper for seeing
the base plate could cut it to size but
I think Jade did that and that's boring
so we're gonna do something more unique
all right so EVGA put a ton of thermal
paste in here we're just gonna leave all
the stuff on the sides there are small
SM DS in there not generally a good idea
to dig with fingernails around those and
it's not gonna hurt anything if anything
might help marginally so we'll leave
that there now we need to just see will
this ek block fit like I want it to
well this ek block felt like I wanted to
and we're gonna need here's another
problem because we're in sli we're gonna
need 90 degree fittings on this
otherwise no trouble okay okay
that'll work barely very barely fell
very barely work okay we're just gonna
need to run 90 degree fittings on here
to get the tubes away from the other
card so that we can still fit them in
the SLI I think we should be good so
gonna mount this and some small memory
heat sinks the memory just for the
record when we were testing our hybrid
card with the memory and the VR I'm
exactly the same PCB even testing it the
hottest module was still like 55 degrees
even with a heavy overclock and that's
because we had so much airflow on it
this card will still have a lot of
airflow
but it's gonna be the middle so I will
be adding some memory heatsinks on it
just to improve efficiency a bit it
doesn't need to be ice-cold Jay's been
pushing his vrm and everything else
really low in thermals and we're not
we're just gonna focus on the core here
and getting everything else reasonable
so I think we're gonna do the same thing
as the hybrid stick that through one
side put the knot down on the other that
should be all there is to this and
getting some thermal paste on here hang
on wait wait wait
let me let me imitate the comments hang
on that's way too much they're all
pasted Steve that's way too much they're
all pasted okay okay we got one half the
counts hang on hang on
let me get the other half we need a lot
more of this okay maybe it may be a
little more a little just on the cheeks
ah Steve that's not enough thermal paste
the the group saying that there's too
much they're all based the the former we
have found that actually it's irrelevant
and now on a GPU is way better to have
more in fact I'd like to have a bit more
in the middle there but whatever mmm
maybe a little more maybe just for the
contours we'll do a little more or maybe
not
damnit I need to get a skinnier screw
maybe I should
what was it Jay did that one time to get
to get through the motherboard maybe I
should just do what Jay did that one
time
where's the do you think I should just
do it Jay did
dammit these Rock nuts I think I don't
know why I would have an uneven I'm out
so all the stores are closed because
it's too late and we film too late
nothing's ever open so if you wonder why
would you janky thin sometimes that's
largely why but I don't have the right
size not have fun with that comment you
bastard
I've got plenty of locking ones so I
show the screw through it let's see if
we can get it to work yes so when you
need a now I'm not walking not
apparently you just drill through it now
no it's not gonna be as strong as the
others but I don't know I'll replace it
tomorrow when the stores are opening for
something for now I just want to get
this thing built set that aside as the
special one now we need some heat sinks
for the memory because so this vrm like
we discussed in the previous content and
and build Zoids analysis it's it's fine
like this can run without anything
except for air
the ACS vrm can run probably without
even much air but it's fine so we really
don't need to do much here other than
get some airflow on it but we are going
to get some heat sinks on the memory
because it's getting hot we're pushing
it kind of hard and it also does not
need it but it will reduce the amount of
air flow we need in a given area so that
will be nice we can kind of take it
easier on the airflow front be very
interesting also completely unnecessary
okay so maybe we'll come back to the
waterblock on the BRM idea later if we
really need it but I just realized is I
need to spread
some eraser on the PCB there is a reason
for this this isn't this isn't just to
see anyone thinks I'm going crazy so
we're actually gonna pull that block
back off for a second
probably the best idea to do that yeah
okay all right so unfortunately we're
doing some stuff but it's something
gonna be smarter to do it this way so
I'm just gonna spread some of this
kneadable eraser all over the service
surface of this and that is to protect
us from short circuits in the event of
condensation okay so we've coated this
thing in kneadable art eraser and that's
going to be for condensation and serious
water buildup and drip around the block
as it goes below ambient temperature
which is something we'll be showing more
later maybe a stream or something like
that and so that's done now I need to do
I'm just I decided we're all the things
off we're just gonna throw these on so
for that I am going to be using some of
this which is just a thermal tape it's
it is thermally conductive and it's
sticky so it's kind of like an extremely
thin thermal pad in a lot of ways we're
just going to use this on the memory and
then we're going to connect that to our
heat sinks
this is awful this is so bad that's the
trick that's it all right so the trick
I'm going to use here cuz it's extremely
sticky and hard to work with the stuff
is place the pieces I want on the small
one for now and then I'll start peeling
it and cut them as it goes I have a plan
here too involving multiple heat sinks
on the middle ones
hey okay okay so we got the vram plates
down heatsinks took a long time to
attach them I'm at a loss for words and
we're gonna go with probably air cooling
for the BRM I guess maybe I don't know
probably air cooling then we're gonna
use that that good stuff that kingpin
cooling thermal paste which is on
kingpins website and it's also blue and
it's like the only paste that's blue
that's that's not really the best reason
to use it does it still though it still
reeks nice okay cool
GPUs better have too much because if
you're not covering a part it's a
concern but also it annoys the
commenters and further
this thing's gonna wiggle around while
I'm applying it so that's actually a
valid reason all right we should be good
there okay all right so man that took a
long time so we have heat sinks for our
memory we're gonna blast it with air
flow without probably hopefully without
causing too much condensation to drip
down that's still a major concern but
you need to figure that out later
and then probably should have even put
more in there more play-doh in there but
the vrm for now we're gonna go with air
and see what happens and then if it's no
good we'll put a water block on it but I
think that that'll wrap this card so now
it's it's on to the next one whichever
that may be but we'll test this one
first with the hybrid that we have
already just for some voice over here
this is the part where we started
insulating things it took a long time so
for this what we did was blue shop towel
on everything and the ultimate goal is
to stop air from hitting stuff but if
air does happen to hit something then
hopefully the shop towel catches it and
hopefully the needa bowl eraser under it
will also prevent any drip edge from
hitting PCBs or circuits or anything
like that so this was a pretty long
process we also
the backside because the backside runs
below ambient and that's the problem for
condensation of course this was done for
both our EVGA XE ultra and our asus
strix cards and then we also used a
captain tape that's that yellow tape you
see along the outer edges of the GPU to
cover all the small SMDs that surround
it because water will form on the cold
plate down there if air can get in and
it will so we lined to the outside of
the GPU just in case with some non
conductive tape and that more or less
shows the rest of the build-up process
so at this point it was just a matter of
getting everything working testing it
getting fans on it all that stuff and
then posting the scores you eventually
saw which were twelve thousand whatever
they were 242 I think and then we'll be
doing a live stream today as well so
make sure you check back for the stream
it'll be mentioned earlier but it's at
it's at 7 p.m. Eastern Time on the day
this goes alive which is October 5th I
don't know where to start with this we
did like the card mods I got 1 cards on
a riser I don't think that will impact
performance too much but maybe a little
bit and what we're working with here is
a Strix 2080 TI and EVGA XE ultra 2080
TI i have bios mods that I got from XOC
community from both of those and we've
wrapped all this stuff so anything over
the motherboard I should probably wrap a
bit of this but it's wrapped in blue
shop towel and part of that's free
condensation part of its it's actually
all for condensation and then we have
the blocks and you'll see this in the
build-up footage the blocks are like
crazy wrapped up in blue shop towels
Wade helped me out with some of that I
have heat spreaders on the vram but my
concern is that the shop towel will
prevent a lot of the air from getting in
as far as it needs to they're surrounded
by that that eraser artist eraser so
that will insulate them thermally and to
solve that problem we put on a bunch of
fans so that's the bench now it's time
to fill it with ice and do some testing
on it especially condensation testing so
for this we're gonna just turn on
everything in one second let make sure
not doing this while my arms are still
wet so we're going to turn on the fans
there's an option to do dry ice later if
we want to I just need some circulation
over the bucket for co2 reasons because
carbon dioxide so for the condensation
test it's getting a lot I need to tape
some of that down some more what we're
gonna do is dump ice in there turn the
fans on see if any condensation forms
and so the shop towel has two purposes
one is to stop air from hitting any
metal surfaces while they are cold
because we're dealing with ambient
temperature air and sub ambient
temperature in the loop so that's a big
concern because if any air hits like a
piece of metal forms condensation and
then blows water-filled
air around the bench it can definitely
short something kill something so part
one of the shop towel is to prevent the
air from hitting things contrary to what
you normally do part two is if there is
condensation build-up it soaks it into
the towel rather than dropping onto the
bench and I also have some shop towels
strategically placed under each card in
case any drips down off of the tubing or
the pump towards the PCIe slot so time
to fill it with ice and see how this
works in a couple 10 pound bags of ice
buy more later and I'm gonna start with
maybe half of one and see if
condensation starts forming alright here
we go the next move after this if we
need to go up be dry ice
at which point we'd have to add
antifreeze and a piece of the loop but
let's start with ice try not to splash
too much
okay now there's our starting point so
for temperatures right now we're eating
11 degrees Celsius and that's for the
loop temperature I believe and we're
eating eight point eight degrees Celsius
in the tank really what we need is more
ice a lot of it's migrating and melted
so that's gonna melt really fast I think
we're gonna have to put a lot more ice
in it at once to help preserve the ice
and then close the lid to reduce the
reduce some of the escape of the cold
so let's buy more ice for that but our
goal is still going to work which is
testing for condensation so this point
question is is there any I'm not seeing
any
I think I've got what I need I just need
to see if it forms condensation now
we're below ambient on a lot of the
components because they're all attached
the same power plan so this is the ice
bucket and then the tube going up into
the system the reservoir full of cold
water these are our pumps which are a
lot hotter yes and the rest of the
system and then over here you can see
the hub of one of the fans and then the
cars themselves which are obviously
below ambient just what we want
yes and there's right in the middle
there's the cold plate so the backside
of the cold plate the backside of the GP
is very cold right now which is why we
why we did this test because it's it's
insulated so it should be ok and really
I should probably not have this be below
ambient when we turn it on because the
concern there is that everything's cold
and it's gonna get hot very fast is
everything plugged in
so we should not have an external pump
and make the same mistake Jay did so
let's move this pump to the main power
supply okay time to turn it on you ready
you nervous okay that's good so we're
good there I think the power cables
plugged in it would appear so
that should power the pump as well at
this point the fans are going both pumps
are going we don't even know if these
cards like survived surgery yet so well
we won't know if something goes wrong we
won't know what it is all right so
everything should be flashed now we're
ten degrees loop temperature it's
getting pretty warm now and nine degrees
in the box that need to dump more ice in
but we're just gonna validate everything
all that stuff first make sure all the
settings are right well actually first
card is that 16 Celsius second tards at
15 Celsius so it's never probably good
on those let's just run it window to
anyway and see what what they look like
when it's operating just to be safe
CPU 49 50 but we're in a GPU test right
now
so 24 see the first card originally our
EVGA card was at 66 during this test
this was on air and we're at 30 on the
ACS card might be pushing a little
harder I don't know that's the first
card in the loop so should be cold air
but we're hitting 21 60 megahertz on the
clock now we're up 2198 crashes so we
still can't do that it might need to go
colder for that or something
we are at ten in the reservoir nine
point nine in the reservoir seven point
four in the cooler okay our MOSFETs are
at 23 degrees on that side not the most
accurate in the world but it's pretty
accurate 33 for that fat 35 for that one
we're good there I can't hit them I can
hit the side of that memory module 28
that's a reflective and a missive
surface that's not a good point to
measure so our hottest memory module on
that card is about 32 degrees so we're
good even on the parts I was worried
about
why not just like fill it with the water
that's already in there four degrees on
the loop 2.6 on the cooler okay
oh that's quite the improvement for us
but we got to get up to Jay's score
still start at 12,000 CPU score 15 3 34
with GPU so it works now I need to tune
the graphics settings J has magical
hybin parts now we just need to get our
GPU memory up higher so let's just jump
high to start and see what happens and
the answers probably crash we might have
some deficit from that riser card in
there too but I'm not sure typically
it's not very much if there is any it's
passing as the RAM doing Ram is just
fine
there's a next graphic score 15,000 369
that's certainly better 15 3 6 9 and
that's at 160 offset 980 for one card
and 160 and 1064 the other let's keep
pushing that memory
definitely the clocks are way higher
than before I'm overclocking more than
previously 15,000 505 that's a big jump
nice
well we've beaten tear Bauer now up
until the point he decides to try and
considering he was cheeky and names his
upload just a quick validation test so
score just jumped up by 200 points for
us which is major the overclock so I was
using before or like significantly lower
than they can be when the cards are 9
degrees so it's pushing like over clocks
a lot higher now all right kick that
under thank you okay it's too much water
in there and we need to add more ice or
emptying out some of the water this is
gonna be kind of hard to stop it's gonna
spray everywhere so you might want to ya
know a button would have been better
okay ready
it's almost like we should stop it from
the inside how would it feel like I get
nice smartest thing we've ever done okay
everyone wanted an ice cube in the
reservoir that one time so we're getting
pretty close to the scores we want
without shunt mods I didn't have any on
there for these tests
I already applied the liquid metal to
the ACS card in the front and now I'm
gonna try and get in here and get on
this EVGA card I've put a nail polish
around it to try and minimize risk of
shorting things but that inductors
really close done this before with the
efi card and it sucks just as much then
i coated that entire inductor leg though
and liquid metal as well so where's my
good pedal in the help ah so that it
doesn't get coated in the liquid metal
and I've got a better way to do this
with three milli ohm shunt resistors
that I prefer to use but the problem is
I would have to unbuild half the loop
and you get the cards out and that's
gonna suck so we're just going to liquid
metal route for now and if I really need
the extra power target we can take it
all apart and do the soldering approach
it's just that's a lot more work so
alright that's pretty good on that one
that's a lot so that'll that'll help us
out with the resistance I need to do the
backside now and that'll lift our power
guard because we're still heading V rel
power and SLI performance cap limits in
gpu-z so power is easily resolved kind
of alright so that'll work for our
liquid metal application now we just
boot it up check the power limit off to
drop the offset on the clocks because
there's more power now so it's gonna
clock higher natively and our goal is to
hit higher than 2200 5 megahertz
consistently so that's it hope you
enjoyed it definitely an interesting
experiment for us and we'll be doing
more of this we have some special
products coming in to work on even lower
temperatures but we're not sure what our
plans are for that yet just make sure
you subscribe to catch that go to store
documents nexus net to support us
directly because this kind of content
turned out to be extremely time
expensive to make and so if you want to
help us out directly that's a good
Avenue otherwise
