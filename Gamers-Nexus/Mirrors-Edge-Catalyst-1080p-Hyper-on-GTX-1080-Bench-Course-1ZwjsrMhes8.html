course so we're looking at Mirror's Edge
catalyst and I'm running this on two
different types of settings for purposes
of this very quick video and those two
settings are 1080p with hyper graphics
and that is the maximum setting and 4k
with high graphics so first of all this
is all running on a GTX 1080 and the
main 30 second course is what we use to
benchmark all the GPUs in our suite
you'll see that full benchmark online
later before getting to the rest of this
quick discussion this video is brought
to you by enter max and their new lick
max giant open loop liquid cooling
solution from computex so Mirror's Edge
catalyst this is an origin game which
means we face some of the very same
difficulties we saw it with battlefront
and one of those is that there's a
hardware limitation tied to the account
so you only get five sort of installs
five activations on different hardware
configurations so that means 45 GPUs
we've already hit our limit and I bought
this game out of pocket so I'm going to
either have to buy another one or wait
around for EA or Nvidia or AMD to help
us out and get us a code for the
remainder of our video cards on the
bench otherwise what we're looking at
right now is the GTX 1080 gameplay the
30-second benchmark course is just the
first initial sprint that you run in the
game when you're doing the training that
gives a pretty reasonable load level on
the GPU and then later in the game once
you start getting more involved with
particle effects and things like that
there is a bit more load but overall
this is a good representation here's a
catalyst is very heavy on post
processing which means that the frames
are mostly interdependent the frames
look at things temporally there's a lot
of temporal post FX going on
and most of the beautification is
happening in the form of lighting
particles and shadows and things like
that the actual geometry isn't all that
complex the game does look pretty
similar to the original mirrors edge
which is a good thing overall so stay
tuned for our full benchmark and review
of Mirror's Edge catalyst as we get
through the remainder of our video cards
that were benchmarking if we can ever
figure out how to bypass that for device
limitation or whatever it is so thank
you for watching patreon link a personal
video as always I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
