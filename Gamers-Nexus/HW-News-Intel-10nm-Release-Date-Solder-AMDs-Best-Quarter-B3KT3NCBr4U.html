hardware news video this time we're
talking about Intel and their 10
nanometer delay that's been going on for
ages now along with the new rumors about
potentially soldered Intel CPUs for the
9000 series talking about Samson and
their apparent development of a GPU
coming up
AMD posting its best quarter in about
seven years and more for this week's
Hardware news episode before that this
video is brought to you by Corsairs HS
70 wireless gaming headset which focuses
on comfort with memory foam adjustable
ear cups and a padded headband the
headset has a 40 foot low latency range
over wireless lasts for up to 16 hours
of gaming use and as extra focus on
build quality to ensure it lasts a long
time
learn more at the link in the
description below very quick GN news
first we're still moving into an office
we started the process by the time this
video goes up will be mostly done and so
yeah things will be changing
significantly for the better coming up
not significantly from your end just
from our own process we'll be fast we'll
be able to do more tactical testing all
that will have a moving vlog coming up
for the whole process should be pretty
fun so keep an eye out for the moving
vlog for our office move in and set up
and also we have GN beer glasses on the
store now there are cobalt blue 17 ounce
with a gold trim on the rim of the glass
and those are listed on store doc gamers
Nexus dotnet we have some some cool
b-roll of them if we can put that on the
screen while I'm talking about it so
that's on the store if you're interested
in those they're available in single or
double pack so you can obviously order
more than that so first item in tile
delivering 10 nanometer systems by
holiday 2019 let me start this off by
first saying we had a great question
from someone about what's the deal with
10 nanometer saw it recently and so I
spoke with David Cantor from real-world
tech about it he's one of the leading
technical analysts and runs actually
excellent forums as well on the
technical side so we spoke with him and
if it's not already live from this video
goes up it will be shortly got an
interview basically just via phone
talking with him for half an hour about
Intel's 10 nanometer delay is what the
deal is on a more technical level we
talked about you
via lithography a multi pattern name and
stuff like that and explaining why well
more appropriately he explains why one
might be the cause of the delay pretend
nanometers so Intel's announcement then
their second quarter 2018 earnings had a
record quarter for them but there were a
few caveats and one of those was that
the ten nanometer class chips aren't
expected until holiday of 2019 so that's
official now and this means that most
realistically those CPUs will be in mass
production sort of by quarter - ish of
next year 2019 with system integrator
availability towards the end of the year
that probably be about October or
November for the most part most likely
October though so we're looking at that
for the timeline for 10 nanometer and
Intel is going to continue rely on 40
nanometer until then so one of those
things are relying on will be the eight
core CPU coming up it's up basically
confirmed at this point until his own
documents indicated it and 40 nanometers
done welfare until they've managed to
get something like 70 percent
performance gains out of it from their
first launch but we'll see whether or
not they they can keep pushing it and
getting more out of it for long enough
to compete AMD has an aggressive roadmap
where they've got seven nanometer
products expected now a quick thing here
seven nanometer versus ten nanometer one
isn't better just because the numbers
smaller it's a bit more complicated than
that comes down to things like a density
for instance and that's something we'll
discuss in the David Cancer interview if
you're curious about how that works and
why one isn't just inherently better
there's a whole lot more behind it so
not long ago Intel announced that it was
shipping ten nanometer in limited volume
to select customers including we think
Lenovo and that was likely to deflect
skepticism about their mark 10 nanometer
process so as it turns out those
shipments were limited to a few
customers including some customers in
China and the shipments were largely
dual car core parts with no IGP in
them's pretty limited usefulness and
Intel has continued to push 40
nanometers in the meantime they are
anticipating challenges with increased
demand and supply for the existing set
up but the 10
delay is likely the cause for the
increase in supply and demand for 14
nanometer so inside insists that they're
working with customers and fabbs to
address these issues and we will see how
it goes they started of course the big
statement by forcing the CEO to resign
so that let's kind of started that one
in dull 9000 series unlocked CPU is kind
of details again for the thousandth time
now via rumors this one this was a real
previous one was actual news run
earnings call so the Chinese cycle aller
has listed supposed specs for the Intel
9000 series we've seen these a few times
now top three case keys were included in
that including the upcoming coffee like
a refresh and the possible specs have
been picked up by rumor sites and it's
it's still a rumor so we've picked up
some information for easy digestion
let's just go through it and obviously
grain of salt with all this part so the
rewarmed Coffee Lake will see a debut of
the i9 branding in M s DT mainstream
desktop and that's where the product
stack is the eight core 16 thread I
$9.99 hundred K King so that's gonna be
at the top the product stack so let's go
through some of the specs on the table
for this the 9900 K is again the
flagship allegedly 8 core 16 thread
there's probably some truth to some of
these at least core accounts we don't
know about the frequencies but this one
is listed as a 3.6 Q Hertz base and
boost is listed as 5.0 what that really
means a single core and dual core 5.0
max boost with the 8 core boost at 4.7
the 9700 K is probably the most
interesting this one has 8 cores 8
threads will likely be a bit more
affordable still 95 watt TDP and a
single core 24.9 with the rest of it
following obviously 9600 KS an i5 6 core
6 thread and the rest follows in the
same sort of progression as the previous
two just to be clear that was a rumor
let's get into another one while we're
at it
9900 k 9700 K might use solder kind of
hesitate to even include this one
because we've heard this a million times
before we heard about the 886 k wasn't
true and I don't know that it'll happen
but it's possible so rumors
a German website suggests that Intel
could move back to soldered IHS is for
the 2k SKUs with upcoming 9000 series
CPUs I will say this is something that
Intel could use with their lack of major
architectural changes until probably 10
nanometer so if adding solder is
something that they can do to at least
make the product a bit more exciting
than a refresh we're all forward of
course but either way if it holds true
it'd be the first time Intel's used
solder since probably Sandy Bridge which
would be 2600 K 2500 K stuff like that
and Gollum dot de the source of this
rumor claims to have several Intel
related sources allegedly that have
independently confirmed as a quote that
Intel connects the metal lids to the
processor via solder so we'll see if
that holds true the move back to
soldered heat spreaders would certainly
be welcome and we've long talked about
solder versus not doing it and you don't
need to deal it and D liquid metal to
use intel parts let's make that very
clear you don't have to do it you don't
need solder but it gives a lot more
overclocking Headroom obviously things
run cooler they will run with lower
power leakage as a result it's about
four percent power leakage for every 10
degrees Celsius you change the
temperature so it would be a good change
overall it's not necessary in the
strictest sense of the word but it's
only that we would very much like to see
next one finish off these rumors before
getting back into the actual news
so Samsung allegedly is working on its
own GPU likely for mobile devices so
it's flushing out engineering teams to
help bring their in-house eview
ambitions to fruition
apparently the latest among those hired
is dr. Chen ping Liu Liu is formerly of
Nvidia Media Tech and Intel Fame and
will serve as vice president of
Samsung's GPU IP development exactly
what kind of GPU Samsung's working on is
presently unknown it's almost definitely
mobile there's really no reason they get
into desktop so mold heart makes sense
Apple has recently elected to start
developing their own and how a silicon
design silicon component designs and
other rumors point towards Samsung
designing
potentially gaming phone which would
compete with the one ASIS just showed
off although it wouldn't be the biggest
competition in the world for Samsung so
perhaps developing the future of their
Galaxy phone around a custom GPU
solution but we'll keep an eye on it
we're not really mobile coverage not
that interested in it as an outlet
overall but it's it's worth looking at
if someone's making a new GPU next one
AMD this is this is for her this is a
published earnings from Andy so Andy
posted their best quarter in 70 years
and the announced their financial
results for second quarter of 2018 and
quarter two ramps up AMD's already
profitable year q2 marks the one year
anniversary of Zen the Zen architecture
and a watershed moment for AMD as it was
both their return to competition and
profitability both of which they
desperately need it in so did the
industry as a whole net revenue for the
second quarter sum to 1.7 six billion
dollars with a net income of 116 million
dollars and these highest net income per
quarter in seven years
this is especially significant compared
to just a year ago where AMD suffered
quarterly net losses of 42 million
dollars their one point seven six
billion of revenue marks a fifty three
percent year-over-year increase and a
seven percent increase over the previous
quarter so strong points for the quarter
include Rison processors and epic
processors side note here from what we
understand some of the enterprise and
server customers are likely to begin
picking up epic in a much more
accelerated fashion when the next
generation of it launches because some
of the actually one of our web hosts
that we work with have had reservations
about an AMD product that's brand new
architecture given and these been out of
the game for a long time and server so
now that those reservations are getting
addressed it's likely that a lot of
these companies Enterprise companies
that had concerns about a brand new
product might start buying into epic for
the next round of it Radeon has had
sales through largely mining but some
gaming sales as well and Andy is
currently working on 7 nanometre
products while I in five just keep in
mind again
that five or seven was ten they're not
linear comparisons although it certainly
be easy if they were and these spending
by the way about twenty five percent
more on its research and development
than previously to continue its momentum
and increase its ability to remain
profitable as it gains a foothold in the
CPU market next up of NZXT introduces
craft or CRF tea and how if you look at
that and think it's a monitor actually
it's not so NTS season apps the new
service and upbringing limited edition
hardware to gamers basically stuff like
pub G cases they've done things like
csgo cases in the past with different
skins for hyper beast for example so
they are aiming to continue that the age
700 pub G limited edition is the first
one and it features obviously Abhijit
elements in it so that cases up for 200
bucks and the next item is to be
announced in August additionally 10% of
the sales are going to the gamers
outreach charity finally hardware sales
for the week EVGA is 1066 gigabyte at
this time can be had for about MSRP
which again and I know this is getting
old now but is actually good considering
the first six months of the year when
they either weren't available or were
atrociously expensive so that's kind of
MSRP now there's an additional $20 gift
card copy destiny - if you value those
otherwise you get the idea so promo code
n en GTX at checkout for $80 off list
price at time of filming hopefully it's
still there 1080 and 1070 TI prices have
come down a bit so those are they
continue to be pretty decent clothes
that much RP about 450 bucks for the
lower prices of the 1070 is will link a
couple of these deals in the description
below as always last week I think we had
thread Ripper was still marked down so
Andy's got a lot of overstock of thread
Ripper the sale will probably continue
to go on ad infinitum at this point
they're just trying to clear your stock
before thread refer to comes out which
is in not on August 13th or so so if you
wanted thread Ripper wanna and you don't
care enough to wait for the second
generation like maybe it's just an
enthusiast thing it's not a bad price
but
that price may look bad depending on how
good threader birth 2 is so we'll see
we'll keep an eye out on it and yeah
that's it for this one thank you for
watching as always you can go to store
that guarantees access on that to pick
up our new beer glass we're gonna
patreon.com such gamers exes upside
directly we have one behind-the-scenes
video on patreon of the new office but
we're pushing an entire series of old
office new office for both sentimental
and historical reasons as we move so
subscribe to the channel to catch all
that it'll be right here on the main
channel for everyone so thank you for
watching as always I'll see you all next
