benchmarking charts today but we're
reviewing this one with a twist for this
benchmark we're testing the CPU entirely
as a CPU ignoring its integrated
graphics out of curiosity instead to see
how the $55 part does when coupled with
the discrete GPU to further this we
overclocked this supposedly locked CPU
to 3.9 gigahertz using multiplier
overclocking something that shouldn't
work and which is disabled on almost all
of the motherboards for the a and the m4
family at least for a thon 200 GE series
parts in this instance the 200 GE at 3.9
gigahertz posts significantly improved
the numbers over stock making it a
candidate to replace the retired price
position once held by the Intel Pentium
CPUs at least up until the 14 nanometers
shortage before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte am the RX
580 and RX 5 7 8 mid-range video cards
gigabyte a or SRX 570 now starts at $150
us on some retailers offering an
affordable gaming solution for high
settings and 1080p these cards now come
with your choice of games picked between
Resident Evil 2 Devil May Cry 5 and the
division 2 you can pick two of three
learn more at the link in the
description below this is a $55 part we
know it has an AI GP in it it's got a
Vega integrated graphics solution we've
looked at the our 320 200 G the r5 2400
G in the past and they're interesting
but they deserve kind of special
standalone benchmarking that's a bit
different from our standard CP benchmark
suite what we're interested in is seen
is the Athlon 200 GE a good replacement
for where the g3 2 5 8 once at 4 with a
G 45 60 once at because in tal now it's
Pentium G Series like the G 5600 for
example in the 5400 they're way too
expensive
they're like 100 plus dollars which is
really where I three territory used to
be and should be so to see Pentium class
CPUs north of 70 $80 is pretty
disappointing because there needs to be
a good replayed that 32:58 used to be
something like a 50 $60 part and you
just can't get that anymore so that
markets lacking that's where we're
looking at the 200 GE today and we're
also overclocking it
that's where it gets a bit more
interesting because we tested the 200 GE
on every vendors motherboards we tested
it on a sous and with the crosshair
seven hero which is completely different
price category that motherboard it has
the multiplier unlocked and it's got
voltage unlocked but in reality when you
set the multiplier it'll set it'll apply
once you get into Windows it just
ignores it so you can set 3.9 but it
doesn't do anything and that's what the
newest BIOS updates then we tried
gigabyte and with gigabyte we tried the
be 350 by board I think to a be 350
something like that and gaming three
board same problem there it's it's
locked and the CP is supposed to be
locked by Andy so they're following this
back the gigabyte board just doesn't
even show you the multiplier it's a bit
different there and then finally as ROC
same thing doesn't apply the multiplier
even if you set it so then we found out
that MSI we used the b3 for the tomahawk
for this Zen one architecture part with
the newest bios and we found out that
MSI with Aggie subversion 1.0 0.0 0.6
does allow you to do multiplier
overclocking on the 200 GB which is
really exciting because you can push it
a lot harder with multiplier
overclocking it's just product
segmentation at the end of day which is
interesting because that was the whole
pitch AMD made when they came out with
Rison saying well look you can overclock
any of our parts we're not artificially
segmenting it like in town out
realistically every company segments
their parts artificially because you
can't survive otherwise but that was the
pitch and it didn't apply some reason to
the 200g II because they want to
introduce more of them later and then
finally for differences between the our
320 1200 there are three 1200 and the
Athlon 200 GE we compare a lot in these
benchmarks and it's important to know
why the performance gaps emerge that do
because they're both technically for
thread parts it's just that one of them
is two cores four threads and one is 4
cores 4 threads now typically under for
example Intel's architecture you might
not see that big of a difference between
2 core 4 thread and 4 core 4 thread in
some games but here we're seeing a big
difference and that's because a lot of
the die on the 200 GE is
allocated to a GPU which we are not
using in these tests and because it's
allocating that much dye space which is
limited to a GPU you end up with about
half of the cache this is really
important so you've got level 1 level 2
level 3 cache l1 cache it's the closest
to the CPU cores and is the most
important it's also the smallest because
naturally as you kind of close in on a
square you get smaller and smaller
towards the center there's less space
towards the center and so obviously it
follows that there would be less space
for l1 cache which sits near the center
and that l1 cache it's SRAM its static
Ram it's extremely fast it's also
extremely small so on the 1200 you're
going to put 384 kilobytes of l1 cache
you know with 1 megabyte of l2 on the
200 GE but 2 megabytes of l2 on the 1200
any of with 4 megabytes of l3 on the 200
GE at 8 megabytes of l3 on the 1200 and
then finally back to l1 384 kilobytes on
the 1200 versus 192 over 200 GE that's a
big difference aside from the core
difference and aside from the the memory
limitations the memory controller memory
speed you can get on the 1200 versus the
200 GE F 1 2018 uses the codemasters ego
engine and unlike a lot of other games
we test pushes extremely high frame
rates that rarely become GPU bound this
is good for sea view benchmarking at
1080p high F 1 2018 positions the Athlon
200 GE at 107 FPS average when stock
with 64 FPS for 1% lows overclocking the
200 GE to 3.9 gigahertz boosts it to 124
FPS average a climb of 16 percent in
terms of frame times that's a move from
9.3 millisecond to average frame times
to an 8 millisecond average frame time
comparatively an AM the are 3 1200 for
core 4 thread stock CPU ends up at 144
FPS average with an overclocked variant
at 163 FPS average if you're willing to
overclock the 200 GE it does start to
inch towards the r3 1200 stock CPU but
manages to do so at half the price for
an ultra budget build this might be an
okay choice
the G 5600 is Intel's closest
competition and its price is simply too
high to be worth considering at 100-plus
dollars these Pentium should be closer
to 70 to 80 dollars like they were in
the past were they to actually make some
sense especially for the price to
performance ratios were looking at
here's the frame time plot for f1 2018
for frame x remember that lower is
better but more consistent is better
than lower for every spike you see in
the frame to frame interval that's a
longer period of time between the
previous frame and the current frame and
the interval between frames becomes
noticeable to the user particularly
close to those 40 millisecond spikes
which are perceived as stuttering the
200 GE overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz
doesn't well overall with a consistently
lower frame times then the stock version
and the lengthened line also illustrates
it moreover all frames rendered if we
plot the overclocked 1200 you'll see the
consistency of the redline is overall
improved versus the 200 GE showing the
best experience of the three plotted
devices although it's also about two
times the price that makes sense but
this gives you a picture of what the
individual frames look like in the game
each one of those lines is a frame and
what you want is them to be as
consistent and flat as possible while
still being low on the on the scale you
want to be closer to for example sixteen
point six seven milliseconds would be 60
FPS at 1440p the stack is similar we
lose some frame rate off the top but
overall performance is nearly identical
that's because we're not changing
anything in the environment that
stresses the CPU and instead focusing on
imposing a GPU limitation at the top end
of performance but that requires the CPU
is able to keep up which these low-end
ones can't these results are
functionally the same as at 1080p as a
scaling versus the r3 and Pentium CPUs
Assassin's Creed origins gives us look
at a popular series that likes frequency
but also leverages core count more
heavily than most other games on the
market this is made evident by
positioning of the 79 80 XC and
seventy-nine 60 ex CPUs which often have
a frequency deficit but a core advantage
at 1080p medium the Athlon 200 GE also
illustrates this core and cash demand at
low-end wear bottlenecks down to 41 FPS
average when overclocks to 3.9 gigahertz
a 9% lead over the stock 38 FPS average
of the 200 GE the gt600 is able to lead
at 52 FPS average with its increased
frequency but still struggles when
compared to other CPUs on the market the
r3 1200 stock CPU ends up at 53 FPS
average and increased over the 200 GES
38 FPS average of about 8 milliseconds
average frame-to-frame interval that's
noticeable here and overclocking the r3
1200 further assists and playability
bringing the average frame rate up to 59
FPS average for a total frame to frame
interval average of sixteen point six
seven or so milliseconds none of the
lows or frame time consistency plots
suffered disproportionately from the
averages in this lineup is just that the
averages are low overall for the 200 GE
decreasing geometric complexity would
assist here as with draw distances but
there's only so low that you can go in
the settings before there's just nothing
left that you can tune down 1440p
doesn't change anything for assassin's
creed of course except for the
chart-topping CPUs like the 9900 K + 79
T DX e at the low-end performance and
scaling are identical as at 1080p we are
heavily CPU bound by these low-end
products and playability of assassin's
creed does suffer with the $55 AMD
Athlon 200g II CPU even when overclocked
it could be done on the lowest settings
but doubling the budget to an
overclocked to r3 1200 boost the average
frame time from a dismal 27 milliseconds
to an acceptable and fully playable 17.3
millisecond average frame to frame
interval Far Cry 5 has had some odd
frame time performance in some CPUs
lately something we've Illustrated time
and again with the 9600 K test
variability data we presented in our
9600 K review we're just now starting to
dig into far crys odd performance
behavior as it reminds us of the GTA 5
bug we discovered a year or two ago
where some CPUs would hit the engines
framerate cap and then stutter hard as
they bounced off of the frame rate cap
in essence the GTA 5 bug meant that
higher frame rates
resulted in worse frame times and worse
experience but only for the quad thread
i5 CP use of the time we're digging into
Far Cry 5 to see why it behaves in
similar ways so for now we're
only going to show the average in 1%
lows until we have a better and fuller
picture of what's going on at the low
end of those frame times at 1080p normal
the Athlon 200 GE stock cpu ends up at
about 62 FPS average which is playable
and has reasonably consistent frame
times for a $55 part overclocking with
the MSI board helps significantly
boosting us to 71 FPS average the r3
1200 for perspective leverages its
additional die space for cache and
physical cores well running at 81 FPS
average stock and 92 FPS average when
overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz the G 5600
operates at 85 FPS average continuing to
prove an overall poor value at its
current variable price point of roughly
$100 at 1440p the same sort of scaling
appears we have some fluctuations in
framerate but given that only the
chart-toppers hit a GPU bottleneck
there's not much movement at the low end
of the chart civilization 6 offers a
unique and entirely different look at
CPU bound computational workloads for
real gaming scenarios like turn-based
strategy games and grand campaign games
where AI players calculate thousands of
possible actions for 6 the AMD Athlon
200 GE really suffers its average turn
resolution time is twenty four point six
seconds meaning that a game with 5 AI
players will upon clicking your end turn
button take 123 seconds two full minutes
until you can play again for an extreme
example the 790 DXE at 4.6 gigahertz
would take 50 6.5 seconds or roughly
half the time to process the same 5
turns with its eleven point three second
per turn average overclock in the 200 GE
fully demonstrates why we say Sims 6
still prefers frequency for its largely
single and dual thread dependent
crunching where our performance climbs
to a twenty one second turn time average
this is a turn time at requirement
reduction of thirteen point four percent
per turn which is absolutely noticeable
moving to the r3 1200 stock CPU doesn't
provide much value against the
overclocks 200 GE but does provide a
significant turn time reduction of 17
percent against the 200 GE stock
overclocking the r3 1200 to 3.9
gigahertz propels it to an 18 second
turn time for these two CPUs we're
looking at Zen one architecture on both
the 1200 and the 200 GE
with differences that
9 gigahertz being a higher core count of
4 cores 4 threads rather than 2 and 4 on
the 1200 alongside a massive difference
in cash the r3 1200 has more die space
allocated to the CPU components there's
no IGP here and that allows for extra
physical cores and the 384 kilobytes of
level 1 cache alongside 2 Meg of level 2
cache and then 8 megabytes of level 3
cache level 1 is the most important as
it's the SRAM closest to the cores or
static Ram which is why the 200 GE is
192 kilobyte l1 cache is such a Punisher
in these types of titles the 200 GE has
half the cache across all three levels
as compared to the 1200 not to mention a
more limited memory controller blender
is 100% unintended for the Athlon 200 GE
processors clearly but we ran it through
the workload anyway just for some fun we
don't have the other low-end CPUs here
to compare because we don't have 10
weeks to wait for them to finish
rendering but we do have the 200 GE just
for some perspective so the 200 GE has a
mixed workload part that may
occasionally be used for 3d rendering is
as expected completely against our
recommendation
it took 145 minutes to finish our GM
logo a single frame render although
overclocking aided significantly against
that time horizon to bring down render
time to 119 minutes that's an 18% time
reduction but the r5 2600 destroys the -
energy ease performance at 39 minutes to
do the same work it's more expensive but
if you're doing this type of work
regularly it really is worth trying to
skip a few meals to afford a better CPU
it'll be worth it so as for how this
thing does it's a pretty good
replacement for where the G 45 60 ng
32:58 once stood they were strong parts
that if you didn't want an APU which is
a perfectly valid thing to not want but
you had a really strict budget of less
than 150 bucks to spend on your CPU and
your GPU those two CPUs made a lot of
sense but they are no longer really 45
60 you can kind of get around that price
it's just kind of old it's like 80 bucks
still too expensive and for the most
part it's not worth it the 5600 should
have taken its place or the 5400 but at
time of writing this content new egg in
the
u.s. have those prizes as a at about
$100 plus or minus 20 depending on which
part you're looking well not even - plus
20 sometimes so 100 minimum we saw him
up to 120 it's just crazy
the reason those prices have gone up is
because there's a severe shortage of 14
nanometer parts Intel's not making a lot
of them and there's demand for them so
retailers have reopened to price them up
but that means they're not really
suitable another price points better off
with like a 1200 and overclocking it for
example or going the next step up and
getting an r5 or an i-5 or something
even so then to really fill the true
budget class the - energy eads as well
even if you're not going to use the IGP
if you're just buying a dirt cheap CPU
that's not garbage and coupling it with
a non garbage cheap GPU like 1050 if you
can find it a really cheap 1050 Ti or an
rx 550 560 something like that it's a
good CPU for those combinations we
haven't worked with the IGP yet so can't
speak to that side of things but I can
tell you it's not going to be that
powerful the are 320 200 G if you want
something cheaper than a 55 dollar CPU
and $100 GPU the 2200 G comes in 50
bucks cheaper than that it's a really
good part we liked a lot it is limited
of course but if you overclock the GP of
the CPU it does pretty damn well on its
own it's just a better CPU for APU for
something like overwatch or csgo or
something like that there's kind of
eSports titles rocket League and if
you're curious about that part check our
your recap of the best CPUs of 2018
because we gave it the 22 Energy an
award for the best budget gaming CPU and
you can find information on that in that
content so overall a pond 200 GE
hopefully MSI doesn't pull that BIOS and
if they do we'll make it available to
you but hopefully I am that you can
officially adopt this overclock in
support of the 200 GE cuz it is supposed
to be locked but it's just so much
better when you overclock it to 3.9
gigahertz and it's trivial takes like
zero effort and the power draw isn't
even really worth talking about we do
have numbers for it but it's just it's
insubstantial really so that's it for
