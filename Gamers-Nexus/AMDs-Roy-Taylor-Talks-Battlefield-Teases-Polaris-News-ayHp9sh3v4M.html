AMD who previously threatened to cut my
hair I did that's right add all those
scissors yeah we were at a GDC right we
were we were at GDC yes before we get
into that all this computex coverage is
brought to you by a massage new x99
motherboards ready for broad well II
including the x99 a gaming pro carbon so
today we have a it's sort of less AMD
side more just gaming side in general
Roy Taylor is a pretty big fan of
battlefield who I am you talked about of
the previous video what's so let's let's
do a Roy reviews battlefield what's the
the first one he played oh it's the one
you played the most okay the very first
point I play was 1942 which I really
really enjoyed I thought it was just
terrific and I've been playing him ever
since one of my favorites was
battlefield vietnam the soundtrack was
awesome and I just thought they really
they really recreated the jungle staff
and then fight in fitting the city's I
just was really great and then so 1942 I
only played a little bit could you pipe
your own music into that game through
the helicopters and stuff yeah I can't
remember when I was nineteen forty-two
so there weren't any helicopters
actually what mostly sticks in my mind
was they had this kind of like I was a
bug or kind of feature thing where you
could actually view as a soldier you
could jump on the wing of a plane and
you could actually fly along from the
wing of the plane which is kind of funny
yeah so a battlefield 4 you've played
right over a thousand hours yeah what's
your rank 132 right now actually no I
think I can 434 so there any nvidia fans
out there unless he's down with what's
what name should they look up so I'm
Leone do le le OU n idee oh oh and he
fat actually I was talking presentation
just now there's some great great fans
at pc / so so Ryan shroud the editor got
me together with their fans and they did
a Kilroy competition in fact we did
three Kilroy competitions they were they
were really really fun actually but I
wasn't so easy to kill so yeah I did
pretty well that wasn't our as I believe
that mmhmm yeah what about battlefield
one what are your thoughts on that one
yeah that's that's what prompted this
video I am
so excited about battlefield one being
in world war 1 i'm a big history buff
anyway and the chance to fly you know
 wolf and the chance to say that
on camera is really awesome and also we
might have to Center that in that show
yo I said I think I said it correctly
it's okay but you got got biplanes you
got artillery pieces you've got World
War One tanks you can exist it looks
frickin awesome and what about on the
AMD side is anything we can talk about
new coming up talk about today for AMD I
can say that we will continue our long
association and partnership of
Electronic Arts and dice and AMD fans
can expect to have a fantastic
experience playing battlefield 1 so as
always that links in the description
below follow us for a computex coverage
I believe Andy has a presence at
computex as well we do have a presence
at computex so we'll be talking a little
bit more about polaris new GPU family
and all the great things that it can do
very cool so as always more information
on that as it rolls out thanks for
watching and we'll see you all next time
thanks thanks guys all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
