public service announcement about
modular cables on modular power supplies
and how to avoid making mistakes that
could cost you so I'm joined by Patrick
stone here he's helped me at the site
for a number of years now behind the
scenes and at CES things like that
Patrick you helped me understand a bit
better previously some of the concerns
with modular power supplies I think we
can go over that today so first question
that we should talk about why don't we
mix and match cables between modular PS
use yes so it's kind of tricky in that a
lot of PS use like to use the same
actual connector so let's take a
standard manufactured PCI Express
connector so inside the power supply is
the female version of that connector and
on the end of the cable is the male
version of that connector but then on
one manufacturers cable the red and the
yellow and the black are in one spot and
then on the other manufacturers cable
they kind of switch it up right you got
to look out for that kind of stuff and
that's because cables actually are
standardized so this is a question that
I kind of saw posted there's there's two
different ends of the cable right and
one end side that you may have that
plugs into your molex your SATA your
PCIe devices the CPU power on the
motherboard 24-pin power those are
standardized if you plug in a cable from
any one of these PSU is on the table
into a video card it will be the same I
like to call that the device side right
so device side we know what we don't
necessarily know is the power supply
side right and man those and so the
crazy thing is a lot of the times you're
not going to run into any trouble
because you're gonna have some that have
this narrow ishka nectar on it and then
some that have this big fat wide right
3x3 connector on it and then you've got
some that have a PCI Express connector
on it I think the places where you get
into the most trouble the places where
I've seen the most mix-up is
the molex style connector and the PCs
PCI Express stock connector those are
the peripherals in general - because
SATA uses generally the same as molex so
in this specific instant instance I've
got two cables from two different power
supplies this is a silverstone cable it
goes to this power supply mm-hmm this is
an EVGA one and they even have the same
you know they're not sleeved differently
in use so really the the problem here is
if we just look at the ends of these
cables the wires aren't in the same
place so if I plug this into the
silverstone cable or into power supply
EVGA into silverstone what we end up
with is in this instance yellow and red
are in two completely different spots
yeah not good and it depends I haven't
tested this and plotted it out
specifically so the damage may vary or
may even not be visible depending on the
device you plug in and that's because
when you're plugging in devices to power
supply to a cable they use different
voltages right so fans the fan we have
on the table and we'll talk about the
coloring in a moment there's a 12-volt
fan we can see that by looking at the
label yep that's 12 volts this only
cares about 12 volts and ground so if
you plug in something like a let's let's
say like a fan maybe a fan hub but a
controller of some kind Corsair
controllers things like that the
controller may be a different voltage it
may be the same it could be 12 it could
be 5 and if it's 5 volts and you plug in
a 12 volt device then you don't have an
expected result necessarily yeah yeah I
mean it's so really the way I think
about it is you've got three
possibilities your first possibility is
you get really lucky and the different
manufacturers cables match up right it
could work fine the second possibility
is the cables are in the wrong spots so
you have incomplete circuits which means
no current flow once again pretty lucky
right yeah there no damage nice to say
yeah third possibility is red is where
yellow should be yellow is where red
should be
orange is where black should be and we
have reverse polarities over currents
over voltages all kinds of bad and right
feeds into other components power supply
and maybe protections in the power
supply or and whatever component usually
are right but they will only protect you
so much and it's when you're mixing and
matching specifications there's no
guarantee that anything works like it
should that's exactly right because it's
not designed to handle it so there are
different voltages coming out of the
power supply generally a 3.3 12 v and
and then your black cable as well as you
can see here those need to line up I
guess when in doubt check the manual yes
oh absolutely
read your documentation if your power
supply has a label on it just make sure
you read the label if you have a little
manual I mean I like to think that
people that are doing what we do people
that like to build systems are usually
pretty intelligent people and you know
take take five minutes read the five
page manual and it just to a point here
it may not be in there what specific pin
layout is in the power supply because
they might why would they define it
because they sell you the thing and
you're supposed to use their cables with
their thing good point so if that's the
case and you're like where did this
cable come from I think it came from the
one I'm using if you think that stopped
like we get rid of it now if you really
need that cable you can check yes right
you can do a continuity check and see
see if the pins align and if they do
then hey maybe it was from the power
supply you were about to put it in yeah
absolutely and if when he said
continuity check the thing to use
multimeter right here you can even you
can even do some other types of testing
which he's shown in some earlier videos
were for a couple years yeah yeah and
like then like you can you can trick a
power supply into turning on and you
could even do like voltage checks to
make sure that if you have a yellow wire
you're getting 12 volts out of it
while you're getting five volts out of
them instead of some voltage that you're
not supposed to be getting so
multimeters can be a good check but like
you said if you're not sure you stop
yeah be patient
you know analyze situation investigate
what's going on yeah and multimeters
we're after the tutorial here today on
how to do a continuity check it's very
easy I'm sure there's a million of them
on YouTube just check you can back probe
if you have to depend on the and out in
back probe one end you probe the other
end doesn't make a is it continuous and
if it is then you know which which end
of which cable on one end goes to which
pin on the other end yep and that's what
you need to know to know if something
works so I think that covers the basics
now quick cute FAQ type things to go
through one of the common questions I've
received is let's let's do this one
first why are they not standardized on
the power supply side they're
standardized on the device side I think
that goes back to the manufacturers
saying to themselves hey this is our
power supply we have provided you cables
with it there's really no reason for us
to have to be the same as other
manufacturers is that kind of where
you're coming from - yeah I think so
there there is an argument to be made
for standardization and it's mostly to
protect the users but you have things
like this one which I can't get out
there yeah this is a universal header on
this particular EVGA unit coincidentally
not compatible with other EVGA units so
even with it now obviously you can't
screw this up this won't go in there but
the point is even between the same
vendor right there's no guarantee that
one Corsair PSU to the next or EVGA or
whomever it will transfer cables the
reason for that is things like this
where EVGA has said we're gonna sell it
an expensive power supply it will have
the universal headers they can plug in
anywhere that's a feature we want to
charge money for another option Rosewell
off the top my head has an older power
supply the
a plug in the end and they've got LEDs
around where the connector is so that's
the thing they wanted to do so that's
what reasons not standardized mm-hmm
now next thing to talk about is the Keen
so I saw some folks saying well you
shouldn't be able to plug this into
another one because they if you can and
they keyed it wrong yeah it's not that's
not true either
that goes back to we talked about into
the beginning of the video we were just
talking hey
these little connectors that you plug
into the power supply what not
not like this one for per se but like
this one right here it's it's an
off-the-shelf PCI Express connector and
they're using those because they're
inexpensive and easy to get all this
sell them by the millions I'm sure is
it's it's it's cheap why not you're
putting it on one end already we will
not put it on two ends and call it a day
and now normally for a PCI Express cable
you'll have eight pins going into the
power supply and coming out you'll have
maybe six or six plus two
yep and four molex you'll have six out
of the power supply and then your molex
out at the other side yes but the point
is that connect the plastic itself is
the same yeah so there's nothing really
to do with keene it's just that the why
would you customize a special T and for
your device and more expensive yeah
exactly and you guys don't want to pay
more for your stuff do you and some
people do and if you do you have stuff
like that where it's literally
impossible to screw up yeah true but you
also end up in trouble you know for
other specific scenarios we won't talk
about that but yeah I think that covers
most of it I don't know is there
anything else we should mention here
that that's really it the only thing
that I would like to say just to kind of
sum everything up is this if you're
working with a power supply and you plug
everything in and then you hit the
button and you feel like something's not
right and it doesn't behave the way you
want it to then time out hit the power
switch on the back for good measure you
got it and make sure it's shut down
power down your unit check everything
again you just spent a bunch of money
all this computer equipment
protect your investment check everything
spend ten minutes checking everything
again and then go back and try again and
as a ten years ago I built my first
system
I remember missing a cable I think was
an EPS 12-volt happens all right yeah
and it's not a big deal if you're if you
kind of stop and look at yeah that's
what it can become a big deal exam so
yeah stop and check if you ever have
questions where you're like man this is
pissing me off and frustrated I don't
get it
tweet at us at gamers and exes I'll try
to help you out because that's what
we're here for so yeah I guess it boils
down to they really you should the cable
shouldn't get mixed anyway to begin with
agreed if they do because maybe you just
don't know this is a problem or you have
a million power supplies like we do and
it happens try and figure out what's
right otherwise get rid of it by another
one straight from the manufacturer and
then in the future throw your cables for
each unit into a bag label the bag you
know EVGA 750g 2l whatever organization
always a good thing yeah it saves time
later as we've learned here so I think
that's it for now as always patreon link
in the post roll video to help us out
directly making more content like this

more information and pin out charts
things like that that you've seen in
this video subscribe for more we'll see
