of ask GN I think we're on episode at
number 30 but there's no special
occasion we're just to another ask GN so
as always post your questions in the
comment section below
finally got that right after saying it
on the last two videos you have
questions person bullet we'll try and
get them for the next video but this is
basically a Q&amp;amp;A segment so starting off
we've got a question from Reza and Elle
who says hi GN your custom GT X 1080
hybrid mod inspired me to do the same
that's awesome I'm pretty pleased with
the results it doesn't go over 45 COC
and underload my question how important
is the cooling for other components on
GPUs such as vram does the hybrid fan
really help with anything or just for
show so I talked about this a little bit
in the gigabyte extreme review and the
EVGA a hybrid versus the Seahawk I think
yeah that one so those two reviews we
talked about it a bit because the EVGA
card on the gigabyte card both cooled
vram gigabyte one also cools the vrm
with it's sort of with its liquid and
directly through like copper solder heat
pipe solder aluminum so very indirectly
it cools the vrm and then directly cools
the vram sort of through a copper plate
that can actually cold plate of the the
CL see as for how important it is one
thing I can tell you is that when we
were doing some of the tests previously
with the maybe I think it was the 10 60
I was forced to remove the base plate
for some tests and ultimately we ended
up filing down the plate as many of you
know but when doing tests without any
cooling on the VR the vram at all and
that includes something like an aluminum
plate it was still performing fine even
though the the blower fan was really
doing nothing in that scenario because
it was just spinning there was no
enclosure to guide the airflow there was
no cold plate or anything to sink the
heat so it did perform fine and by fine
and air quotes I mean didn't immediately
crash or exhibit a catastrophic failure
now down the line it's hard to say how
much that actually impacts your lifespan
for the car
for the memory gddr5 and 5x is not that
high-voltage especially if you're not
overclocking so it's it's not under as
much of a threat as something like the
GP or a CPU some kind of serious piece
of silicon but to answer the question
does the hybrid fan help the answer is
yes depending on what you're looking at
especially but in particular if we're
looking at let's say a car that doesn't
have a copper plate or an aluminum plate
on the vrm the blower fan does more than
just cool the vram it does cool the vrm
and that's definitely important cooling
the vram as I said it's it's hard for me
to really know the answer to that
because we don't have a good way to look
at the temperature of the vram without
actually putting the thermocouple on
there or something because there's no
software that reads it so let's let's
kind of push that to the side for now
just talk about the vrm the voltage
regulator module VRMs get pretty hot
they can sustain a high heat some of
them upwards of 125 C for the inductors
but they do still need to be cooled and
they're dealing with basically sort of
cleaning your voltage delivery to the
GPU and train it gets enough voltage and
off amps make sure it's all clean and if
that gets too hot and it will lose its
efficiency so you have some power
efficiency loss you can draw more power
than is necessary to perform a certain
task whatever it may be you're doing
powering a GPU just to perform a
performance cycles or whatever so that's
important yes and the hybrid fan does
cool that it's responsible when I say
hybrid fan what I mean is the vrm fan
that's mounted to the normally the base
plate or the shroud or whatever on top
of the right side of the board that
cools the BRM generally so that is
important vram it's hard to say from
kind of a stock clock perspective how
important that is but we've run it
without cooling I wouldn't recommend it
because I don't know what the long-term
impact is but you can definitely do it
overclock and probably not a great idea
to overclock the memory or over bolted a
name these
not cool it next question is from Aaron
Cox who says hi Steve I'm considering
purchasing an LG 29 at um 68 p which is
the best naming monitor's by the way
have the absolute best naming scheme on
the planet because they are all letters
and numbers and it's it's human readable
I says it's a 21-2 9 ultra wide with
free sync and a new wants a new GPU to
pair with it so here's the question is
it better for me to get into our X 480
and leverage of the free sync
capabilities of a monitor or a 1070 and
use its greater raw power to output
higher fps and have a card I can
potentially use for longer and then he
says more generally what purchasing
behavior would you suggest to people
when shopping for cards is the old put
most put the most money into your GPU
still valid so that's that's a good
question and it's well worded let's
start with the question of is it still
valid to put the most money to GPU week
as always it depends on what you're
doing if you're just gaming I would say
I don't know that I'd necessarily use
the words the most money but in terms of
proportioning your your purchasing the
GP is probably still worth spending a
good chunk of your cash on for for most
gaming bills now it depends because if
your options are by an i3 or an i5 and
getting a slightly cheaper C or GPU can
let you get the high five I'd probably
do that instead but generally if you're
at an i5 or i7 level already then yeah
it makes good sense to put some money
into the GPU and that's especially true
as we roll into new AP is if they ever
actually kind of start hitting
mainstream which they will eventually
but it's it's still a little while out
so and buy based on strictly API future
promises right now but that is that is a
point where CPUs will kind of be they're
still really relevant we talked about
this before obviously but you will be
able to get away with a slightly lower
spec CPU if you've got a good GPU that
can handle juggle all the draw calls
like that from a low-level API as for
the monitor specifically that is a very
hard question because AM D just doesn't
have something that directly competes
with 1070 1080 current generation right
now and that's not gonna happen until
Vega so it really does force you into
the position of well I either have to
buy a ton 70 plus to get a higher
performance or a 480 and you get free
sync and I think my suggestion would
probably be depending on what video card
you have now it may be worth waiting
until Andy pushes there Vega GPUs just
to get that free sync because it would
kind of suck to lose free sync it's
actually just like g-sync is it's
actually a good feature the other option
of course by different monitor but G
sync is expensive and the competitors an
ultra wide space are very expensive like
the predator which is a thousand plus
dollars so my answer to you would be
depending on how you feel either wait
and look at Vega or maybe buy an R X 480
if you're okay with sitting on using
something now and then pulling it out
later put it in a different box or
whatever they're not that expensive
relative to what you're looking at
purchasing anyway so if you have a way
to repurpose it and upgrade in a couple
months then that might be an OK path to
take but otherwise I kind of wait 1070
is a good card though but next question
fd6 says in your experience which
components are more prone to fail from
voltage issues I only asked because I
had my fan and audio cables melt on on
my r5 case and I was astonished out of
all my parts I never thought the case
would be an issue I've seen that before
- I don't know what case I think it was
on a salman case a an exceptionally high
quality Zalman case that we may have we
may have reviewed that one but yeah that
definitely happens so it's normally with
fan controllers and things on a case
it's just an issue of the fan controller
being dumb and
pushing the wrong voltage and having
low-quality wires or whatever and
they're controlling it but for the
question of what normally fails in my
experience I have had a good amount of
motherboards fail from voltage being
pushed through the CPU things like that
especially FX 9000 series CPUs even with
boards that were rated for them if it's
a low-end board we still had burnouts
we've shown one of those on camera so
motherboards I've had a lot of issues
with in the past not too many recently
other than the one with the FX 9000 and
what else I have also run into issues
not voltage issues causing a power
supply to fail but I've had plenty of
power supplies fail and cause other
things to fail because of that normally
after a lightning strike or something
the power surge or something like that
but yeah I'd probably pin it on
motherboards for the most common issue
that I've run into personally video
cards and CPUs are surprisingly robust
you can really screw up an over volt in
your and your BIOS on a CPU and as long
as you haven't forced to that voltage
and you haven't started really load
testing it it might actually be okay
wouldn't recommend it but but they're
pretty robust generally despite being
one of the more one of the component you
need to be more cautious with next
question Matthew Osborne Hastie when
looking at your review for the i7 6700 K
that was a long time ago I notice there
are no comparison to the 6600 K is there
a reason why they weren't compared
directly to each other well GNB making
these comparisons for future generations
of CPUs I was looking for the difference
in framerate lows between the two chips
after digital foundry mentioned that the
lows is where i7 shows the largest value
but doesn't provide I graphs I can
reinforce that claim to some extent we I
haven't extensively tested it but we've
looked at things like Metro last light
in particular comes to mind where even
disabling hyper-threading there's
actually a big difference but I don't
have charts for it for you right now
now as for why we didn't test the 6600 K
it's because I didn't have one
now because since then we were the buy
one
intel does not currently provide us CPUs
there PR team has changed far too much
for me to keep up with so I just buy
them now but we didn't have one that's
the answer to that as for the future
yeah I am planning on getting an i5 and
i7 probably an i3 on the bench for when
Zen comes out we'll revisit all the kind
of core CPUs you'll be buying that will
include the either last or current
generation depending on what what's up
with kb lake but uh but yeah we'll be
looking at them then I can't say though
that there are there are some places
where an i7 shows value in the low
performance and it's primarily going to
be seen if you're trying to hit like a
144 120 Hertz output for your monitor or
something like that but in Metro last
light it's almost double without
hyper-threading depending on the the CPU
specifically so that's kind of
interesting but the next question is
from Tamsin who says how do you guys
actually calculate one percent point one
percent lows
by plotting a frame versus time graph
and finding manual ADEs some kind of
software we we talked about that in our
video called what are one percent lows
or what are one percent in point one
percent lows that answers a lot of that
at a pretty decent level specifically
calculating it it's just a formula that
we use that we have a Python script
right now that was done in-house so the
script digs through either present Mon
or whatever right now it's digging
through the present Mon data which we
have these four DX oven Vulcan testing
so it looks resent Mon at the
millisecond presents like the the on
present millisecond like the latency
between the frames and from there it can
calculate based on frame versus
milliseconds what are the slowest one
percent of frames what are these lowest
point one percent of frames and then it
averages those and you have your value
so that bypasses minimums things like
that talk about that more in depth in
the other video I mentioned I think this
is the last question
daven dice DV n dice says will you ever
compare this generations hardware to
that of two generations ago EG r9 280 or
60 so we do that in the original reviews
with the Wow with two generations ago
okay we did that with AMD because just a
volume of card stating so I did look at
that with AMD with a 280 and the 280x or
something 285 one of those and the 380 X
I don't think I've actually done that
for the current generation Polaris cards
or Pascal cards that is a good question
that is also a good request it normally
becomes a time thing that my current
plan is because of this question a
couple others like it is to visit these
two generation old cards specifically in
one-off articles sometime the next
couple months and just basically do how
is the 760 today how is this the 280
today or whatever and see how they
perform now versus other cards that we
have on the bench currently that's the
current plan I don't think we
necessarily have the bandwidth to
include them in specific game benchmarks
for example Gears of War 4 or
battlefield 1 I'll try but it's it's
really a time thing and there's a high
demand for current gen stuff and one
general stuff but we will try and do
them in one-offs because of that
question and others so as always thank
