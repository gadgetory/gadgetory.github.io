of ask GN if you have questions for the
next one leave them in the comment
section below or you can join our
patreon discord by going to
patreon.com/scishow Murs nexus and
posting a question the SDN section
before getting to some of the discussion
and questions for this week we have
another gift to open from NZXT who have
contributed such things as the puck or
the puck is this more of them but you
get the idea they send a lot of these so
the newest gift is on the bat it's a
shirt on the back it says I'm txt with
their new logo I guess they're new font
on the front is a reference to a clip
hunter in the Taiwan digital marketplace
when a friend of the site came by and
said to us we're just lucky you're here
and that cliff by the way a lot of
people in the college in that video that
was for the digital marketplace blog a
lot of people didn't get that that guy
even though we had a subtitle for it is
actually a friend of the site and here's
a screen around with us and everyone
speaks another language around you so
you hear someone nail something in
English it's already enough of a catch
and then they say something like fuck
gamers next it's me like whoa
so it was a good attention grab but no
actually was not just a random jerk but
oh yeah they sent us this so I thank you
and EFT for the thermal paste cleaning
rag will put good use to it I have a lot
of CPUs and GPUs that really need to get
a good scrub so I'm planning on soaking
this in alcohol and then using it to
clean things off and probably burn
pretty well after that tear so thank you
for the shirt though I really appreciate
it and before anyone freaks out and
thinks that NZXT is being really rude
it's just playful humor but thank you
that's looks pretty cool so that is the
gift and then before we get the rest of
it this content is brought to you by
EVGA and their CL C kit you can buy one
of the EVGA hybrid kits to convert one
your ten series video cards into a
liquid-cooled card as we've done a dozen
times by now if you're curious to learn
more click the link in the description
below so the first thing I wanted to
show off just briefly for stuff that is
to come we just got this in as in
ordered last night and had it one day
shift so this is going to allow us to
clamp current so it's a current clamp we
can actually now take more accurate
power readings of what's going on for
example through EPS 12-volt cable so
we'll be able to clamp those and have a
full video on it at some point be able
to get more accurate readings for the
power draw rather than just straight
from the wall and that will allow us to
see how much power exactly is going
through something like a V RM for the
next $2.99 motherboard which is a hot
topic right now this was a good reason
to get into more accurate power readings
oh really there's a lot to discuss with
X 299 and that leads into the next topic
which is rush to launches so before we
get into the questions again kind of
front-loading these with discussions
lately rush launches X 299 was certainly
rushed there is is clear as day that the
motherboard vendors didn't have enough
time almost just like Rison release they
all kind of complain to us they didn't
have enough time and the CPUs didn't
really have enough time to get
information out there technically as to
what they're supposed to do who they're
supposed to target how they're supposed
to work and there were a couple problems
now they're not the worst CPUs ever
don't don't take it out of out of bounds
but I know 7900 X is still a damn good
CPU but there's a whole we have a whole
big review on that talking out all of
its ups and downs like thermals and
power and on the upside the insane
multi-threading capabilities because 20
threads of course it's going to do well
in multi-threaded tasks but that's not
without its downsides the point though
to address here rather than just reira
view the entire chip which if you want
to get in more depth on either of those
points look at the review and argue with
us in those comments because this isn't
the place for that the point is rush
launches are a bit of a trend right now
Vega is another one so Andy said they
would ship Vega in quarter two and they
they shifted about a day or two before
the end of the quarter just like a paper
written an hour before duty and it shows
Vega is not the worst thing to ever
happen either same thing as Intel's X
299 they both have their ups and downs
Vegas downs right now are largely
relegated to the obvious rushed aspects
things like driver stability and things
like functional software like Radeon
settings or even just general marketing
and that's the point I want to mention
here so the card as people keep copying
and pasting at the comment forms is not
a gaming card we spent five minutes
discussing that in the Vega f/e review
but the thing to talk about here is that
when you generally have a not a gaming
card you brand it something differently
and Andy has done something very
interesting that with Vega
they liked the architecture name so much
as they've said that they took the name
Vega and they applied it to the video
card series whereas normally you have
Polaris and you have rx series cards
they weren't rx Polaris they were rx 400
rx 500 and so on but this is rx Vega or
Vega F II both have Vega in the name and
this is where it seems like an uphill
battle that Andy has created for
themselves for marketing where Vega
frontier Edition is because it leads the
RX Vega launch is going to kill some of
the search potential for our Vega
because you now have people looking up
Vega and what's going to come up Vega Fe
will come up unless it's launched they
have arts Vega in which case Google will
prioritize prioritize those reviews but
Vega Fe will come up and if people
aren't informed and don't understand
where that card is marketed it will
reflect negatively on Vega as a whole
even if it's not meant to be marketed to
those searching users maybe gamers for
example because it's going to come up
with bad gaming performance compared to
the price and even if it's not meant for
gaming that's what they're going to be
faced with so you've got one good shot
to launch new products and after that
point the people who are not day-to-day
enthusiasts like most of you don't
necessarily keep up with this stuff so
they see Vega Fe
and they already have an opinion on
where it sits and that's why we spent
five minutes talking about what the card
is for in the review but another point
here the interesting aspect is that the
high-end card is Vega Vega Fe the gaming
high-end card is rx pega and presumably
other cards will be Vega variant names
as well so there's a chance for
confusion you lose some of the halo
effect marketing whether it deserves it
or not I was only like Titan I owned a
Titan everyone knows where that sits on
the stack but if you own Vega that
doesn't really necessarily mean anything
once the other Vega cards come out so
you lose some marketing potential there
and then Andy also has a history of
changing their names and losing some of
the we'll call it momentum for no
nomenclatures like the r9 series r7
series which superseded the HD series I
believe they're called hd7000 for
example series so they have that history
of changing the names this time it's
just a weird change and the only point
of this kind of discussion offshoot is
to say that the naming is going to hurt
the product marketing overall because
Vega epi will be attached to rx Bega
whereas something like Titan XP is kind
of distant from GTX even though like
many of the other sites when we reviewed
it we said this is not a good buy for
gaming because it's just it's way too
expensive you could buy a 1080p eye and
have basically the same performance but
that card is at least distant by name
and branding whereas Vega Fe is kind of
the same boat in terms of naming so
there's going to be an uphill battle a
hill that Andy has built themselves that
trying to claw back and understanding a
product positioning for rx Vega versus
Vega that's really the only point of
being this up and I bring it up because
there are a lot of questions we had that
we're like we posted that Vega content
and people are saying wait Vega launched
what like and the reason that people
didn't hear about launching is because
it wasn't market to them
it wasn't marketed to gamers so there's
this confusion of like wait a minute
this is out and that's because RX
failure comes later but it has the same
name hence the confusion whereas if it
were if a Quadra
card launches you don't really have
confusion in the gaming market or of a
fire Pro card launches rwx as they call
it now same thing the gaming buyers
don't say way to make that launched
because it's not relevant to them so
very interesting choices on angie's part
we'll see how our expect lays out no
commentary on performance there yet we
just we don't have it so there's no
point in speculating as we've said since
the review of Vega epi but we do have
more comment content on Vega coming up
with the FE card including the rest of
the thermal results from the hybrid mod
ok so enough of that we'll talk more of
that with the content on Vega as it
continues with actual product first
question is from a travel entity travel
NT who posted on I believe YouTube I
don't know this month this was youtuber
discord but the question was asked GN
curious if you're using liquid metal
deleting the CPU or on a GPU would it be
ok to use a thin thermal pad around to
keep it in keep it contains a liquid
metal that is as long as it's not
thicker than the dye itself so basically
the question here is if you're applying
liquid metal which is liquidy as the
name suggests to the service of a die
how do you contain it from spilling over
onto the substrate and the answer is
just apply a really thin layer and then
if you're still concerned you can use
tape I wouldn't use their own patch for
this but if you're concerned you could
tape off the substrate portion with
something like masking tape or
electrical tape and spread your liquid
metal on it if there is over spill then
you can just pull the tape off what I
would recommend is before going even
that far play around first with a and
analog for the CPU so rather than just
going straight to apply and liquid metal
on to the thing that you care about just
apply it on some other non important
plastic surface maybe so you can get a
feel for how it spreads and how much you
need to cover that surface and then go
from there because that will give you an
idea of how much is required
next question jl rockefeller says i've
been watching so that I've been watching
Silicon Valley lately and even in there
they are making fun of people who got
duped
into bi and VR what happened to all the
hypes this is the same as the whole 3d
bubble I'm not up to speed on the fourth
season but I didn't hope you're talking
about so VR we had to opinion pieces on
VR before getting into the objective
benchmarks the first one was this thing
is really cool
that was when valve showed it off at the
steam booth at GDC two or three years
ago and was the first time I played
around with anything like that so that
it was a really cool experience but it
was an experience it wasn't a gaming
experience like actually playing a video
game it was just a cool thing to do once
and then after that all the booths we
went to for the previous two years
everyone was asking do you want to try
our VR whatever and the answer was
always no no I don't want to try I want
to talk to you and understand the
product I don't want to put the thing on
and then that's my 30 minutes at the
booth that's it takes you on and we
didn't get the information so the next
content piece we produced after more
time with VR after doing some of those
was I don't buy don't be a first gen
adopter and that video got a lot of
people really upset we're early adopters
of VR because I was basically saying in
an opinion format this thing isn't ready
wait for second-generation let's see how
it goes and some people don't like that
and that's fine but it was an opinion
piece so deal with it
so all that to say that what happened to
VR well a lot of points you made in that
video for price still expensive that
instantly puts a lot of people off
buying and then the bigger problem I
think this is opinion territory it's
okay if you disagree with me and I might
disagree with you but its opinion
territory this isn't like an objective
test the thing with VR I think is that
there is a lack of really mechanically
driven games there are a couple good
ones elite dangerous is more of a
traditional game but you can play it in
VR the mechanics are pretty well another
game would be the
the where's it robo rally or something
like that some of those games are okay
as well raw data is pretty cool but
developers are still learning how to
build for this new type of input and new
type of output and until there's a
turning point where they really
understand how to build a game that's
not a wave shooter and not a traditional
game that just happens to use a
different form of monitor then maybe
there will be more adoption but right
now there aren't enough applications out
there for people who are not loaded with
money to pick up VR that's kind of what
I think is happening and as far as the
hype you had companies like all of them
really and the Nvidia Intel all the big
three have been and continue to push VR
because it's such a stressful
application that if they can slap a
sticker on their box that says we can
play it where V already then they think
it sells more units so of course there's
all your hype right there and it starts
bubbling away because there's just not a
ton of adoption it's still doing quite
well don't get me wrong the VR market is
okay right now but you're not hearing
about it as much because these three big
companies already made their push and
now they're in the wait-and-see
territory so I think that's what
happened to a lot of it is it was a huge
marketing push everyone wanted to make a
buck off of VR and the adoption wasn't
instant because even though it's really
cool there's not a strong enough draw
from a a mechanical perspective drawn
those types of players and there's not a
strong enough draw from a financial
perspective to draw on the people who
are more budget-conscious because they
just don't have the money or the
physical space to set up the arc of the
pole experience so you have all these
companies who are trying to make the
money marketing and then they just I
mean the marketing funds were spent and
so you're not hearing about it as much
but now the say VR is dead
we still test it it's still an
interesting application to test and
benchmark but it's also I would agree
with you that yes the marketing hype has
slowed down and that's because it's
shipped it's a thing now people can buy
it and the companies don't really they
spent all their marketing money so
I think that kind of answers part of
that question but some of that opinion
take it for what you will you don't have
to agree with it that's fine so I can
hurt my feelings
all right so next topic gets back to
more objective stuff and easy to answer
things that are straightforward not just
opinion on how the state of VR is which
I know is going to be a bit touchy for
some of you but yeah again no commentary
on how VR is doing in terms of market
share or anything but that's what I
think for in terms of adoption and hype
that's the next one Mitchell
Jean do I don't know that's my best
intent says it's not a hot topic anymore
but I've always wondered and never found
an answer why does the overclock are
seven 1,700 perform nearly exactly the
same as the overclocked 1800 axonal
tasks I know it's the same architecture
and all but that's the point if both
CPUs are the same and perform almost
identically why would the more expensive
one exist is there really no difference
between the two
what did Andy put in the 1800 acts that
made it more expensive but not better
when overclocked I guess with the
question we talked about this in the
1700 review so the 1700 review we
basically said the 1800 X is superfluous
if you're comfortable with overclocking
which all of you really should be if
you're an enthusiast user and you're not
like a business user where maybe you
have warranty concerns or maybe just
company policy is no overclocking we
need stability but if you're an
enthusiast our recommendation was
basically get a 1700 and overclock it
because of the same and so that is the
answer to your question they're the same
the product is the same the only
difference between them is the 1800 X
chips with a higher clock out of the box
than the 1700 so out of the box it'll
perform better but if you can overclock
it and you can if you overclock it to
the same clock rate as 1800 actually
will perform the same assuming the
testing is done correctly if you
overclock it beyond 1800 X it'll be
better than 1800 X stock because not
only is the architecture the same but
the CC X's are the same same course in
threads same really everything except
for clock rate out of box
so why should it exist well that's sort
of what we
in 1800 extra view and then later in the
1700 review there is a market for it
people who don't have the corporate
policy head room or who don't want to
overclock for whatever reason that would
rather spend $200 then spend 10 minutes
overclocking that is the audience it
sells to but seriously it's like it's 10
minutes of work to get a basic
overthought that's stable and then it's
kind of fun to tune it anyway at that
point and and optimize things so we
would still recommend save the $200 put
it towards anything else in the system
and nine overclocked 1700 and but yeah
that's the answer to your question is
there's no difference just out of clock
out of box clocks so I think that
answers that one it is a bit superfluous
for our audience just because you're
dealing with people who either know how
to overclock or are willing to learn so
why not but yeah hopefully that answers
that one answers there's no difference
next question is pants hard good
says I recall that you mentioned the top
exhaust fans can cause issues with large
Tower air coolers in some cases you go
into more detail and is possibly running
a fractal design define s with three 140
millimeter intake and one 140 millimeter
exhaust and trying to figure out if I'm
better with an additional exhaust at the
top or not so that the comment I made is
let's get this out of the way first case
testing is the least scientific of all
because there are eight different
variables for hardware seven or eight
that can influence the results that said
if you're working with a power cool or
generally speaking in some cases and
they are all different like the cool io4
or whatever it was we tested this on
originally in some cases if you set the
top as intake it's better if you set the
top is the exhaust it can be worse for
CPU cooling then if you have no fans up
there at all well no exhaust fans up
there at all anyway and the reason for
that is if you have the think of where
the intake or the exhaust or whatever
the ventilation port on the top of the
case think of where that's located
relative to the CPU tower cooler if it's
in front of the cooler and it's exhaust
what's happening is that sort of
stealing air
it comes in the front and gets stolen
out the top by the exhaust fan before it
ever makes its way to the tower cooler
so that's what happens there bit
different if you have a radiator but
again it's the least reliable testing of
all just because there's so many
variables everyone builds it a different
way but yeah it comes down to does the
fan pull air away from the cooler before
it makes it through the cooler if the
exhaust is behind the cooler there's a
better chance that it helps because the
cooler is pushing that air out and it's
just getting either sucked out through
the top or through the back if you
already have a back exhaust generally
you're fine just kind of depends on what
kind of RPMs you're running how much
pressure you're pushing through those
front pans but that's the idea it's
based it's just where is it positioned
in the airflow channel to the cooler
does it steal air from the cooler and
that more or less answers it and then
the last question it was just kind of
interesting so this was on the how to
manufacture scale out mining video and
the question is from Zaidan algebra says
GN as an independent Channel
is it more profitable to use other GPU
inventory in mining I mean according to
what you earned from this channel the
answer is no a very definitive hard now
because the thing is even with our GPU
inventory we make more money running a
business reviewing those products then
it could be you don't put a dent into
company expenses by making a couple
dollars per day off of video cards I
played around with mining for a little
bit to do that
how do manufacturers feel about mining
video it was a really brief thing to
learn how it works and I mean from from
a financial perspective absolutely not
it's not words that we tore it all down
after learning how it works and probably
won't be pursuing it further but that's
because this is a business so those
resources are already allocated to
things the bench space we've got only so
many spots for benches to be set up and
if I can have it set up so that two
benches are next to each other one does
production
and one does gaming tests and then the
third bench does thermal tests I can
just switch the card one two three and
go through all the tests really quickly
whereas if I've got a machine running
and mining on one of them
first of all room ambient is way higher
as let's Q's the the thermal test but
more importantly now I have to tear down
and rebuild benches so that I can make a
few dollars per day so now it doesn't
make us more money to mind with our
video guard the the amount of expenses
to run a business are so far beyond
eight dollars a day or six dollars per
day per video card it's not even funny
so you're better off trying to use the
space and the resources and the power
and the products like it takes
motherboards to and power supplies to
actually review stuff that gets views
which generates money through
advertising then sit it in the corner
for internet money basically that you
hope will have value later so that's my
view I but that's just I mean if you're
a business with a lot different
perspective as always so that's all for
this time as always you can leave your
questions in the comment section below
