coverage with the RX 580 review which
you can find on the website and channel
already that coverage focused on the
1060 and 580 and today we're focusing on
the RX 475 70 with a splash of the 1060
and 1050 Ti this review highlights the
Gigabyte rx 570 or s card which uses a
dual fan cooler medium form factor and
the new Polaris updates the BIOS before
that this coverage is brought to you by
the Computex conference which runs from
May 30th to June 3rd in Taipei Taiwan
this year Computex is the biggest event
of the year for PC hardware and
technology where we preview the newest
prototypes before they come to market
we highly recommend attending or
following this event online for industry
professionals and enthusiasts learn more
at the link in the description below
other than BIOS updates that improve
idle and relaxed workload power
consumption on the 500 series cards like
these and this one the gigabyte one for
today the other update is increased
frequencies stock and increase the
voltage Headroom allowed by AMD that the
vendors have to actually implement that
on their devices and that allows for
higher performance overall though
marginal in some cases like you'll see
here today the increased frequency is a
way to get some extra performance out of
what's left of Polaris prior to
launching Andy's next major line the
gigabyte RX 5 70 or s card is priced at
$180 right now landing it between the 10
60 the 580 and the 1050 TI cards and
those are respectively at around 240 to
250 and around 140 to 165 at the high
end for the 1050 TI gigabyte is shipping
its rx5 sony RS with clocks at 1295
megahertz in OC mode or 1280 in gaming
mode and the rest of the specs are
exactly the same as the RX 470 it's only
an updated power profile updated by o
some updated frequencies and technically
you can unlock 400 series cards into 500
series cards with the BIOS flash we
started retesting all the cards on our
bench for the 1080 TI review so that
means the low-end cards are still being
retested we've retested the 470 of
course the 575 80 is 480 s have been
read on the 1061 reads on owns 150 Ti is
n read on we still have to work on a few
other ones like the 1063 gigabyte and
484 gigabyte but the
Delta between the 3 &amp;amp; 6 model and the 4
&amp;amp; 8 model of the 10 16 480 respectively
should be the same today as it was
originally and we have content on that
if you're curious or more before getting
started on this just like the 580 review
this isn't a new architecture so there's
not a whole lot of new stuff to talk
about it is the same Polaris just with a
few small updates you Ark is the same so
this review will be focused entirely on
performance that's going to be in power
first and thermals and then gaming
performance with overclocks included and
other than that if you are curious about
the architecture of Polaris you can
check our original RX 480 review which
has all that defined and it has not
changed for the 580 and the 570 cards
methodology is always is linked in the
description below on probably page one
or two of the article the full article
down there will include 3dmark tests
which this video won't have a couple of
1440p tests but otherwise everything is
here power draw is measured out in the
wall this isn't a perfect way to measure
power consumption you'd ideally do it at
the rails but since we're looking at
total system power with only the GPU
swapped where ultimately studying deltas
between components and that's enough to
figure out where they land with 3dmark
fire strike extreme workloads the
gigabyte rx 570 horas system draws 260
watts from the wall and that's about
4.8% more than the rx 40 gave an ex from
MSI or about 26% more than the rx 470
Platinum Card and about twenty eight
point seven percent more than the GTX
960 SSC the rx 580 gaming X system
meanwhile draws about eight percent more
power than the rx 570 system I'm looking
at a few games next for honor posts the
RX 570 system at 290 watts from the wall
which is an increase of 5% over the our
X 480 gaming X and it's also an increase
of about 28% over the rx 470 Platinum
and an increase about 33% over the 1060
SSE the rx 580 at 310 watts from the
wall is drawing 6.8 percent more power
than the rx 570 we see more of the same
in Ghost Recon with the rx 570 at 279
watts from the wall or about 7.7 percent
more than the RX 4 80
27% more than the RX 4 70 and 32 percent
more than the GTX tenzig the SSE 6
gigabytes
finally idle power draw has the 570 at
75 watts total system power which is an
improvement over the 400 series and
the RX 470 for example which runs at
Sony nine watts in the same
configuration resulting in a power
reduction of 5% in the 500 series of the
400 series one idle we saw similar with
the rx 580 and this is expected and the
head tune of the BIOS power profile and
voltages set at the RS 500 series draws
less power one idle or when in multi
monitor and movie viewing scenarios so
the 500 series clearly draws quite a bit
more power than the 400 series when
unloaded scenarios because it's running
those higher frequencies and voltages
out of the box
they're almost go hand in hand in power
as the two are directly correlated
starting with frequency versus
temperature time and fan speed we see
that the RX 570 auras GPU runs its
temperature against the line of about 76
degrees Celsius with an ever increasing
fan rpm that seems to max at around 2300
to keep temperatures to 76 C under a
torture scenario clock fluctuations are
largely unnoticeable with the line
that's nearly flat for the entire
duration of the test
although the fan increases to sustain
this clock rate the user experience and
always notwithstanding is better as a
result we don't experience noticeable
clock range swings and those could
introduce stuttering from frequency
changes if they were to occur looking at
temperatures of the individual
components we see that the gigabyte
board continues its trend of running a
little warmer than its competition from
MSI and EVGA but it's not in a way that
impacts performance
aside from potential and efficiency and
power consumption we're looking at
temperatures on the vram of about 80 to
84 C with the hottest module with set
temperatures of the relatively densely
packed BRM left of the GPU at around 80
Celsius adding the msi RX 580 gaming ex
to the charts for perspective this is
represented by the way by various shades
of red on the chart we see Emma size erm
vrm and GPU components all hover around
68 to 71 see there are different
components at play of course the FETs
aren't exactly the same the cooling
design is different that means we've got
a few variables and we're not anywhere
close to 125 C threshold for most pets
so performance is fine it's just it's
better with MSI and the Twin Frozr
cooler this is particularly true for the
vram where gigabytes 10 V at 570 aureus
use a less impressive cooling solution
for the memory flanking the GPU here's a
resurrection of our EQ thermals chart
which
was the GPU temperature to simplify
things there's more than a year of data
on this chart as you can see here so
we're going to crop it in a bit to just
the most relevant parts for today the
gigabyte RX 570 or s in this crop chart
lands at around 40 6.4 Celsius delta T
over ambient furloughed or about 4.3
cells these idle this is warmer than the
msi RX 580 gaming acts at 41.7 celsius
delta T which is running a more
aggressive fan profile on these tests
the Sapphire rx 470 with reference
blower cooler runs at around fifty point
three Celsius delta T and that provides
perspective on one of the worst coolers
that exists for the rx series of cards
the RS card
certainly isn't impressive in the
thermal Dept but it's also $180 time to
move on to the game benchmarks most of
these will be at 1080p that we did run
at several the tests at 1440p you'll
find most of those charts in the article
below we're focusing on pen ATP for the
video today before getting to the test
let's look at the OC stepping table we
ended up with a stable 1400 megahertz
clock for some initial burnin but we had
to drop it to 13 90 to sustain a stable
clock for most of the games tested doom
was a special case where we had the drop
clock all the way down to about 1350 to
13 60 megahertz to keep stable because
it would just crash on the menu
otherwise other games were run at 1390
now that's the fact Andromeda currently
has the most cards on the chart the
gigabyte rx 570 or s for gigabyte card
lands at 62 FPS average 50 fps 1% lows
and 47 FPS 0.1% lows these frame times
are tightly packed and consistent making
for a smooth experience overall and that
can be said for nearly all the cards
tested with this particular game that
lands the rx 570 at about 780 Ti
reference card levels and effectively
tied with the rx 470 sapphire card the
1050 Ti for comparison is blown away in
price performance by the 570 and 470
assuming a 180 dollar price tag on the
Auris 570 the 1050 Ti runs about 90%
slower than that 570 while the 570 runs
about 20% slower than the 580 gaming X
or about 28.6% slower than the gtx 1060
SSC overclocked in the RX 570 gets us an
improved
about 4.3 percent over the stock card
considering that we're off to
effectively equal performance to a rx
470 in this particular game but five
seventy isn't impressive given the
relative power draw increase of 25 to 28
percent and we can now look to another
title where there's more room for
improvement looking now at for honor the
rx 570 RS card runs at around 37 FPS
average placing it roughly 3.5% ahead of
the RS for Sony for gigabyte card and
about 35% ahead of the $140 gtx 750ti
in other words the 1050 Ti is still
oddly position just as it has been since
our initial review and doesn't
necessarily get a recommendation in most
cases we were able to get an actually
stable overclock on the Auris 574 once
with this game but had to drop our max
stable OC by about 10 megahertz to stop
obliterating the frame time variants
numbers overclocking landed us at about
6% ahead of the stock 570 with only a
slight performance detriment to 1% in
point one percent lower values after
fine-tuning the rx 580 gaming X is the
next card on the charts running 93 FPS
average for an improvement of about 20%
over the rx 570 with the gtx 960 SSC at
94 FPS average as about 60 to 70 dollars
difference for about a 20% performance
improvement with either the 580 or the
1060 for what it's worth the overclocked
570 is performing only a few FPS behind
the SPARC our X 480 gaming X just under
5% total behind that card we're now
referencing AMD's best-case scenario
using doom with the Vulkan API and
asynchronous compute support the RX 570
or S card runs doom while at 1080p
pushing about 120 FPS average marking it
ahead of the rx for 70 by 5.4 percent in
average frame rate in exchange for a
power draw increase of around 25% the
570s also ahead of the 1050 Ti by about
67 percent now overclocked in the 570
doesn't really do much for us here only
moving frame rate bars by about 2 FPS to
the right and equating a performance
roughly equal to that of the GTX 960 SSC
levels pre overclocked the RX 580 for
comparison runs at around 140 FPS
average prio see at making it 16.8%
faster than the 570 stock card doom can
be run at 1440p just as easily with all
these cards
we can look at those numbers now briefly
rx 570 or s runs at around 79 fps pre
overclocked ahead of the rs4 70 by about
7 FPS or 9% rx 570 is close to a 1060 as
I see and performance here and is about
20 FPS behind the rx 580 gaming that
Ghost Recon wildlands at 1080p with very
high settings it gets a little hard for
the RX 5 setting and 472 run but we also
ran tests that medium as part of a new
low-end test suite the 5 sony or s card
runs around 51 FPS average here with
overclocking benefiting our average
frame rate by about seven point eight
percent this lands with stock or is
reasonably ahead of the 10 50 TI and
about 2 FPS ahead of e-470 or 3.4
percent that's not a great trade for the
power increase but it is an improvement
the rx 580 gaming X meanwhile is about
13.7 percent faster than the rx 570 or
is card with the 1060 SSC about 31
percent faster than the stock 570 or s
card looking at our new chart this one
only has a few cards on it because we
just started building this data for the
5 sunny review it we've got medium
settings at 1080p here with the gigabyte
rx 570 now running over 60fps plays in
about 65 FPS average pre overclocked or
at 68 FPS post overclocked result in an
improvement of about 5.6 percent the
stock 570 outperforms of stock for 70 by
about 4.4 percent and outperforms the
1050 TI by about 22% Sniper Elite is our
last game for the charts in the video
though you can find 3dmark and ashes of
the singularity in the article linked
below
just like Ghost Recon we've had to
expand our sniper elite test to include
1080p resolutions we were originally
only benchmarking sniper at 4k for the
1080i launch but we've just begun
building 1080p results we're starting
with the 4k results because the chart is
the most built up and gives some idea of
deltas and next will be 1080p the RX 570
runs this particular bench at around 35
fps a verge stock or about 37 with the
overclock and that puts it around the
same levels of performance of 10 sec the
SSC prio see which was previously
outmatched somewhat handily by the RX
580 gaming X operating at around 40 FPS
average though with a higher power draw
as a trade at 1080p high the RX 570 is
sustaining around 100 FPS average
putting it ahead of the Rx for Sony
platinum by about 9.2 percent and that's
the biggest lead of all the games tested
so that's it for the 5
evany the Auris card at $180 is priced
correctly that's where it should be this
one's a bit warm but we haven't tested
other 572 yet to compare but at $180
it's around the right price this stack
here doesn't really change in terms of
recommendations previously we're
recommending a 1050 over a 460 because
there was a pretty reasonable
performance gain and we were
recommending a 470 over a 1050 Ti if you
could afford the extra 30 or so dollars
it was well worth it in most cases that
remains true here the 570 is slightly
better than the 470 and therefore still
just as much better than the 1050 Ti as
the 470 was previously that with a
couple extra percent on top of it so
we're still recommending about a 1050
over a 460 and we're recommending a 470
or 570 over the 1050 Ti though is on the
lower end 1050 t is like $140 one we
used here could be instituted in some of
the weird price builds where you might
have something really specific you're
doing it's not a bad card it's just kind
of between two good cards on either end
and then for the higher end stuff if
you're looking for something around the
250 dollar mark 1060 and the 480 or 580
are still good for that look at that
coverage to figure out which one you
like more that's mostly a power versus
performance argument between the two but
for the 570 the only thing here that's
really a little different is that the
performance gain over the 470 at least
with this specific 570 there's not a
whole lot it tends to be maybe something
like 5 or 6% in some of the medium cases
we're I think the one game we hit the
most with sniper but a lot of the games
were either basically equal or just
slightly ahead of the 570 and the power
draw increases is somewhat substantial
other than idle workloads or low-power
movie viewing type tasks so if you've
already got a 400 series card as stated
previously the 500 series is not for you
it's not built for you if you don't have
a card that's been made in the last
couple years then the 500 series and the
10 series are still worth looking at
just the 570 is not that much better
than 470 so if you can find a 470 for a
decent mount less than this because it's
used or whatever it might be worth to
buy especially if you're really
concerned about
because if you're concerned about power
the 470 draws less and performs is
really not that much work couple percent
for something like 25 percent power so
