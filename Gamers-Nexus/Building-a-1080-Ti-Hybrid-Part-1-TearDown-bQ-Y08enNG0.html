already be online and now we are tearing
it down so this will be part of our
progress to building a liquid-cooled nad
TI as we've done in the past if you saw
our 1080 TI review it shows some thermal
verses frequency charts where the thin
is clearly limited by its temperature
Headroom so we're going to fix that
problem and this time I'm like before
we'll be measuring the BRM temps in the
process before getting to that this
teardown we brought to you by iFixit
we're using their tools for the whole
thing we have the iFixit Pro Tech tool
kit here which is one that I use
regularly for these tear downs so quite
happy to have it on as a show sponsor
you can use code gamers Nexus at
ifixit.com you get five dollars off the
Pro Tech tool kit is one of their mid
price items then they've got these large
128 bit kits as well which we might
throw to you for some other things so
let's get to it this thing the 1080i is
similar to the 1080 it has the in terms
of the design anyway it's a reference
cooler so it's got the backplate that's
pretty straightforward metal black back
plate with the just a couple tiny screws
around the edges underneath it I would
imagine just like the 1080 it's probably
got those really annoying 3.5 millimeter
allen head screws which I don't know why
they chose that size and then about a
million more over here now if we were
just going to remove the cooler and
place a completely new base plate on
there maybe if you're doing a water
block that would be a much easier job
because I want to put one of these on
there this is an EVGA hybrid cooler so
this is their one from the 980 I in the
1080 it's the same thing it's an ace
attack Gen 4.5 cooler stores pretty well
in our mods in the path you can buy them
separately we're going to put that on
and that requires taking the entire
thing apart which is kind of unfortunate
because they don't always go back the
same way this is a 1080 founders edition
card it require a bit of effort to get
it back to eight well it's really so
let's start with it
the back we're going to take the large
screws offers I think I'm going to
modify my approach to this from
previously so I think the new approach
is going to be to completely remove the
cooler and separate the
on the PCB and then take the cooler part
rather than take it all apart with the
PCB still on there that should make it
easier to deal with the thermal pad if
you're wondering this besides Philip
zero zero okay so how many screws is
that just for the backplate if you're
keeping track it's three six eight nine
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 screws just to get
the backplate loose and backplate has no
special thermal pads or anything on the
inside in fact it barely touches the PCB
at all it's got this raised outside but
as you'll see in our numbers for the
review the PCB back the back of the PCB
is actually not that warm so it's really
not bad even though it looks like it
doesn't do a whole lot doesn't seem to
be increasing temperature in any
substantial way but it's also not
decrease in any substantial way the icx
coolers do a much better job with a back
way
once all pad there what does that even
attach to you let's see so that looks
like it's gone down this I see right
here to some that to build so it for
part of his erm analysis builder will
have vrm analysis for us by the way
tomorrow or the next day depending on
when you see this okay so with the back
plate off now we need to work on
removing all these tiny things what size
are these four he's not before actually
stand corrected they're not 3.5 they are
four
so this point we can more or less
separate the PCV and the plate you can
see them kind of starting to separate
the thing I've learned is I prefer to
separate them with a PCB down on the
table that way the thermal pads tend to
stick to where they are on the PCB not
come off with the cooler but first we do
have to take these screws out and there
are five of these here's our i/o and now
we just have the card in the cooler
let's pull these apart previously we've
watched previous tear downs I tend to
start taking these screws out next
around the radial fan and that frees up
this so the way it will separate is this
piece here is part of the shroud
underneath it is the vapor chamber
cooler which is really just a thin stack
with the vapor chamber in it we already
disconnected that so this pulls off that
pulls off this black piece pulls off and
then there are these pieces here this C
shaped bracket there are two of those
that pull off and patna there's another
piece under here normally actually this
is it right here a lot of small pieces
but we can actually accelerate this a
bit by doing it this way and now I'm
connected by screws so we've got the fan
and the LED kind of hold this here
disconnect that try not to pull by the
cable but whatever
clean it up for this so what we've got
is couple things this PCB is a good bit
different from the 1080 founders edition
the GPU is as you can see GPU 102 - 350
K 1 a1 so that's the full skier now as
I've explained in the past
generally an A Rev means it's
production-ready a1 generally in my
experience in the industry when I worked
elsewhere a one would mean it was the
first shipping production ready Rev and
later you might seen a 2 if they make an
update of some kind
so our first Rev GP 102 is the new GPU
rather than GP 104 106 or what-have-you
107 and 350 is the sub number for the
skew in terms of the memory layout we're
missing a module here means you've got
11 gigabytes in total so we have 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 modules at 1 gigabyte
each these are micron and they have a
skew on them d9 v RL these are the new
micron g5x or gddr5 X memory skis which
go up to 11 gigabits per second rather
than the 10 previously and the vrm got
some thermal pads for covering things
but can more or less figure everything
out
bill do it we'll have a more detailed
video on this for us on our channel but
these are fairchild
sets and so the format here it's a 7
phase vrm design but they are doing 2
sets per phase so it's splitting the
current which spreads the heat and it
shouldn't help a bit with power delivery
but I'll leave all that to build the
discussion he is the throw over clock or
after all power you can see we've got 8
6 and 10 out for our solder points for
another 8 pin here if a board partner
wanted to buy this PCB instead of making
their own they could solder their power
header here rather than up
that's really the only reason that
exists I don't think you'll see a three
header set up on a reference board it's
possible but if you see three power
headers at all it will probably be a
custom board there are a couple of other
places where you can see there is there
are things missing like here here the
memory module of course and that's
really that's most of it
the this is your inductor Bank capacitor
bank MOSFETs for the actual power
management and delivery we have some
doubling going on and I think that more
or less covers the basics of the BRM the
GPU is a good deal bigger than the GTX
1080 GPU which we might have some shots
of that still if you wanted to see a
size comparison it's a bit larger as 28
SMS rather than 20 SMS and then for the
cooler itself which we still have to
take apart the cooler
here's your vapor chamber plus thin
stack we have the thermal pads for each
g5x module they're all pads that are bit
beat up for the capacitor banks big hole
where the inductors go because it was
run really hot and there's no reason to
six are all pads on them better just
expose them to air although they can
take quite a bit of heat because it's
just literally a copper coil inside of a
heatsink
and then this is the FET doublers all
that stuff so we need to pull this apart
so I can get the base plate and put the
base plate back on and use that for the
foundation of our mod okay that's going
to be pocketed so we can't remove that
yet snapped that last time with T 1080
because I'm a 980 it was adhesive and
now they socket it so if you try to pull
it off he'll break that's convenient
the point of this is to get the throne
pads to not just stick to the table
we're trying to give it a surface so
that
alright so there's the acrylic or
polycarbonate window there's the shroud
here's the heatsink four more screws
here I don't know that we need to
disconnect this so ideal we ideally we
leave this radial fan in place so
there's still some cooling on the VRMs
and having a base plate there will
certainly help and as you can see some
pads are all still there so thank you I
fix it for the cutting board and
centralized cutting board pads are still
there so we have vrm cooling
capabilities question is will I be able
to fit this in without taking out the
rest of the screws that looks like it
will fit yeah so I think we can actually
leave those screws in not short they're
holding in actually see I think that
just yeah they're holding the outer
frame to the inner part this this right
here this black part of the frame is
being held into this part of the frame
by these four screws so we could
separate them which wouldn't really
teach us anything we haven't already
learned from the 1080 teardown because
this is the same cooler this thing is
all the same there's a part so this
looks like it's actually cooling but it
looks like something like is actually
cool components but it's really for
looks because there's a partition in
here so there's no air that can go
through here and wick heat because it's
just going to get blocked and there's no
suction from this fan because again
there's a partition so that's entirely
for looks doesn't actually do anything
really I might do something but it's
very it's insignificant whatever it does
the rest of the real coins all right
here
so I think we're good I think that
actually is the easiest teardown ever
for videocard the unit itself is not not
necessarily the easiest out of all the
video cards in terms of the amount of
screws but once you kind of have an idea
for what you're doing it's not bad
we the PCB will be looked at separately
part two we will build up the cooler and
then the plan is the plan is once we've
got all this assembled test it with the
liquid cooler and this will go live
after pax by the way so this this part
of the video is before patches our
impact we have pax this weekend
that means no final conclusion until I'm
back which will be Monday Sunday night
Monday so Pat sum it up by Tuesday that
will have the results and we'll be able
to see if liquid cooling the GPU brings
down the core temperature enough which
it should so that even just without any
overclock just stock with the new cooler
theoretically boost 3.0 should allow the
clock to go higher because it will no
longer have that thermal limitation
which is imposed by Nvidia zone cooler
this cooler is not very good it with an
auto fan speed tends to max out around
50 percent unless you really stress it
at 50 percent that's a bearable noise
level you can actually tolerate it but
you definitely get some more clock spike
eNOS whereas once you force it to 80
percent
it generally boosts a bit higher and
it's way more stable so you have fewer
frame drops unfortunately it's also
intolerable for noise so liquid will fix
that the question is what will happen
when we put some thermal probes on here
some thermocouples and csdb RM temps go
up as a result of that mod since we'll
be taking away something cooling
potential for the V RMS I'm really
interested about that we haven't done
that before thank you for watching as
