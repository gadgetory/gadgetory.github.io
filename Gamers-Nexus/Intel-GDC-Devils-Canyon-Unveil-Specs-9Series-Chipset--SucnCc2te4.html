its 4th gen course this is based on as
well but we're making a number of
changes and we typically do not do this
right so when we come out the processor
light as well cetera then we don't make
any substantial changes to it we just
bump the frequency a little bit till we
come out with an extra line right but
several months ago as again as we were
stepping back and saying no wow we have
this customer base that frankly were
frustrating some of our most loyal
customers like all the people you saw at
that extreme masters event because we're
not bringing them enough performance
it's the kind of we went out talk to
customers got this feedback on new to us
you guys report some of this right so
you know as well so what can we do for
that customer base and by the way I
don't want it to intercept the next big
platform what can we do now and then
build on that with the roadmap going
forward and so with a small tiger team
of some of the most senior engineering
folks at Intel we did a little huddle
figured out what can we do and this is
the part for doing and it will be
available just you know less than a year
you know who's six to seven months after
the time we conceived it's a pretty
quick turn for what we're doing with it
which is we are we just found the
package so we have a new package with a
new thermal interface material on it we
thought will be supported by the nine
series chipset to our next chipset and
this is going to bring a really nice
bump in in performance just based
performance as well as overclocking so
we are really excited about this and so
I told the team you know I don't really
want to call it just and that's how well
the next fourth gen core is what else
could we do it turns out yeah a few
gamers in itself a lot actually and so
we had a little internal contest to name
it and I told them you know I'm gay
I'm probably not the target market but
this is the name of the internal team
came up with bills cannon so codename
Devil's Canyon will come out with this
in mid 14 and we're really excited about
our teams really excited about it this
this is the first one off the line with
the new package we just got it back last
week engineering team tells me it's
right on track with the performance
targets that we set so we'll get it out
very very quickly mid-year really
excited about this one so stay tuned
we'll have a lot more details and
specifics on this as we get closer to
launch okay and so with that again you
know my main focus for the link to talk
to you today was that the desktop is an
important business and market to Intel
we're investing in it and we're focused
with our customers in the industry on
reinventing the category and bringing
new and exciting form factors used to
jizz experiences and new products and of
course I talked about the big things
we're announcing which is around ready
mode technology all the new software for
the portable on ones and the four new
product I just talked through for the
enthusiast space so all four of those
you know new products that within the
last six months you know adding them to
the roadmap okay and so with that thank
you very much and I think we're going to
open it up for some questions right
let's do a quick Q&amp;amp;A session one thing I
want you to mention is cards on people
chattering I really gap yeah so the
cyberlink at the one I tried to show you
really it works in practice I know if I
don't know but it took it's a fantastic
app you're going to love it for editing
photo video so we're making that
available to all of you guys you get a
pre-release that goes into production in
April but we've got this for you and you
can go download it and it's got all the
instructions here to go to go get that
and check it out I'll be emailing you a
code for that so come to me you can also
come to me for The Devil's Canyon sample
program yeah that's right that's right
by the way you know I've told me the
inside folks inside of Intel you cannot
imagine how many beta testers have
raised their hand so we have to kind of
hold them off so we can get some samples
for you guys well then we'll have to
wait all right so okay math questions
yes go to Mike over here Mike over there
tell us what category bells canyon is
the i5 or i7 yes and you can only get
going to be overclocked absolutely I was
wondering why do you guys have to
release or why does it have to be in the
ninth series chipset if it's not a you
know necessarily different chip
internally like the architecture why he
had to go to the night series chips
instead of the creamiest we wanted to
get as much at performance boost as we
could so optimized for the next chips
that we had coming out and that chipset
was coming out anyway right it's not
that's not new to the platform and so we
just paired it and time in the back
had a quick question about a thermal
paste basically are using are you going
back to solder or was it a material will
tell you all about it when we launched I
knew we did a lot of questions on this
voyage giving you a sneak normally I do
any of this to launch but I was so
excited from wait so I just want to tell
you guys discovered we're a little
confused a well Broadwell socket at work
in an existing as well nine series
tripped up work it will be drop a drop
into the existing housing for exams and
nine wait where's my team not series 9
series only 29 years which working with
00 broadwell 1 is 14 nanometer all the
other ones which are Haswell
architecture based are 22 I know it's
kind of a sort of the premise of broad
well but with the new which you're
giving away to talk about here is there
prevent have any any provision going
forward to dad and sort of expansion
capability for discrete graphics with
their BS to the street global shipping
but regarding supplier or some sort of
say the first part of your question I'm
sorry with a new I means a provision you
to add on discrete graphics in the
future whether it be an expansion card
is it a screen ship of some sort we have
to get I have to go back to the nub team
again and add to it but essentially that
this is not for you know in the category
of mini and tiny pcs we have gone from
just the first version adding all kinds
of cool thanks to this hard drive
capability all that have stuff but for
that specifically walk we can go ask the
team at get back
I was what is the TDP of the new that
was cannon processors we're we're not
going to get into specifics but i can
tell you we're not messing with power
just so that you can overclock it so
just expect the same as what we have
today we're you know we're frankly we're
doing the hard work just to crank up the
performance but you have to change power
supplies
on this selaron anniversary edition you
have a right handyman there is no
celeron actually reminds me of the
original cell around me and so on was a
great overclocking part in the very
early days but the pentium actually you
can generate 20 over to the 54 c which
was</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
