hardware news recap for the past week
let's get started with the biggest item
here and that's that there's rumored
integration of am the zen architecture
in the PS 5 or whatever the next
playstation maybe that's not immediately
all that alarming or different because
they're using AMD now they probably will
continue to do so but this is the first
real concrete potential evidence that we
have pointing towards design inclusion
in the next playstation that would be
the first time a Xena architecture
specifically has been using a console so
we'll be talking about that also new
Specter attack vectors that look like
they could exploit firmware access which
is alarming for a number of reasons and
some news on an embarrassing mining ad
that will go through momentarily before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermal Grizzlies high-end thermal paste
and liquid metal Thermal Grizzlies cryo
not is an affordable high quality
thermal compound that doesn't face some
of the aging limitations of other pastes
on the market cryo not has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below
first up leading at Linux publication
fir onyx they are in the technical
coverage space like we are except they
cover basically Linux exclusively into
great depth they published a story that
noted a Sony programmer submitting code
updates for something called ZN ver1
which includes low-level virtual machine
updates or LLVM LLVM is used in software
compiling and a sony engineer's work on
updating LLVM with Xen update
specifically would align with
Playstations utilization of
virtualization to compile software for
onyx notes the following quote on Friday
Simon Pilgrim submitted to clean up for
Zen ver1 code last week there are more
changes across at multiple commits and
these upstream LLVM improvements by the
Sony programmer have been going back at
least two weeks with this
just not being someone off clean up a
tent and then they go on to thank a
reader veronik Saul so indicated that
the LLVM updates are specifically for
sand architecture and if you are one for
connecting dots and forming conspiracy
theories based in reality this one would
seem too soundly suggests the Zen
architecture inclusion in the next play
station logically the ps5 though way
microsoft's done they're naming we'll
see about that so it'll be interesting
to see if am these products get used in
in playstation five but more importantly
or more interestingly we're curious to
see if any Raven Ridge or APU products
specifically our leverage there and how
the semi custom side of Andes business
will go about customizing those for the
playstation 5 because Raven Ridge is a
pretty good fit for a console so with
some up fitting and changes for consoles
specifically it could be a logical
inclusion and we'll see what they do
with that next one Spectre attacks that
can access firmware so first off the
interesting thing here is that anything
that can write to firmware is a really
scary type of malware and it's not
because it can break the motherboard so
you saw a lot of comments on stories
about this specific news item where
people were most concerned that their
motherboards would be bricked
intentionally and you'd be left with
that one actually what's most concerning
is anything that can write to firmware
can survive a format can survive
reinstalling Windows which is the most
common go to fix for any kind of malware
on a computer whether it's you doing it
for your own clean up sake or anyone
really bringing it to something like
Geek Squad or some other computer shop
that's the go-to fix if you can't figure
out how to get rid of it otherwise so
the security firm eclipse iam has
published a new application respect or
variant one which allows access to
system management mode SMM an element of
the bios eclipse IAM is headed by yuri
bull ijen Bulacan I'm sorry former chief
threat researcher and senior director of
advanced threat research at Intel and
according to eclipse iam this quote
runtime part of firmware often referred
to as
my handler has long been of interest to
security researchers and a target for
advanced attackers since this code has
high privileges and operates outside the
view of other software including the OS
and any security applications the
exploit could be used to reveal secrets
in memory as well as expose the
confidential workings of SMM and further
vulnerabilities Eclipse iam has been
working with Intel since March on this
and both Intel and Eclipse iam agree
that Intel spectrum mitigations should
apply to this vulnerability however
eclipse iam raises the point that fixing
the problem will require customers to
manually update firmware which not
everyone will do either because of
laziness or because you just don't know
that you should and a lot of customers
probably don't even know what BIOS is to
be completely fair and Intel serves a
lot of people outside the infinity of
space so it's fun to keep an eye on next
one is just kind of interested amusing
amusing a little sad
Bitcoin specifically is using 0.5% by
end of year will be using 0.5% of the
world's electricity as an estimate so
this is not blockchain as a whole this
is not Bitcoin and all the altcoins it's
not Bitcoin ITT it's just straight
Bitcoin and the report is on live
mint.com
which suggests from a an economist
research paper that Bitcoin specifically
and alone will be consuming 0.5 percent
of the world's electricity by end of
year which is about as much as the
country of Ireland estimates are that
Bitcoin processing consumes 2.5 5
gigawatts
that's up not exactly what he said in
the movie but and that a single
transaction can use as much power as the
average household in the Netherlands in
a month this is the part that I am
unclear on and we did do something and
try and figure out what they meant by
this in the article but what we don't
know is when this live Mint website says
it could use as much power one
transaction uses that much power we
don't know if they mean one transaction
as in I send Bitcoin to you or if they
mean like something to do with mining on
a greater scale ie I don't know
discovering a new block or however it
works so I'm not clear on exactly what
they meant by that but the bigger thing
to this the bigger aspect that I did
to point out is that just like making an
electric vehicle or something like that
are a hybrid vehicle there's an
ecological cost outside of just the
straight usage of power
there's consideration of where is the
power source what's your closest source
of power that's providing electricity to
the mining devices which would be a six
at this point and then also speaking of
basics what is the impact of creating
all of them so there's there's a bit
more than just straight power drop but
we're not gonna get into any further
details than that because I'm not a
boxing expert so that's the news item
anyway the next one Andy unifies it's
discrete GPU and APU drivers this is
something we've been waiting for for a
while now so they're unified driver
packages maybe probably if they work
properly anatec points out that the
release notes for the Radeon software
adrenalin Edition second quarter 2018
wickel is a listing support for the 2400
g2 2200 G and that Andy has called it a
unified driver and users have installed
it successfully with a range of APs and
GPUs installed simultaneously it's also
the first official driver released for
the rise in ApS since the launch in
February so looks like now you can
actually have an APU with an AMD GPU and
have both of them accessible via drivers
that's a good news for where anyone in
that situation next one intel has put
forth a plan to invest five billion
dollars in fab 28 one of their factories
in Israel the plan is set to be approved
by the Israeli government in the coming
weeks as part of the deal until will
receive a 5% tax rebate until 2027 if
approved and a one hundred ninety five
million dollar government grant and a
further one hundred ninety five million
dollars if they make quote further
strategic investments to significantly
upgrade its plant technologically
intimated a six billion dollar
investment in fab 28 back in 2014
probably with the intention of gearing
up for 10 nanometre which has since been
delayed into eternity and then this one
was our favorite news item for the week
it's an embarrassing mining hat Biostar
would like you to know that you too can
be part of the exciting world of
cryptocurrency mining just like these
smiling models of stock photos that have
been photoshopped together with
new I minor device from Biostar they
released three models of people I minor
systems filled with either five 60s or
five 70s the ERX series that is and
ready to mine the marketing seems eager
to prove that crypto isn't just for
sweaty nerds you play games in their
basements but is also for fashionable
stock photo models and anyone can do it
it's fashionable it's easy and there's
also no price listed yet but ahead
expect Abel does note that Fiat only
sorry
specs for each model can be found on bio
stars at website so yeah it's I think
they said it's ultra easy money easy to
set up easy to make money and it sounds
like the kind of cringe-worthy
advertising phrasing you'd see and I
don't know an infomercial so maybe may
work on that one a bit Biostar if you're
trying to win anyone over although they
are certainly doing themselves no favors
by doing the whole look at look look at
awesome Millennials to use the word of
an attack
we're selling a product that will just
print you money and making it sound like
it's a whole lot of it at that Liam Lee
has new Borah light fans we had a one of
our patreon backers I'm talking to you
asking about this while ago and I sent
Leo me an email and this was their
answer basically so they've been out to
their new Borah light 120 fans that have
a range of 900 to 1500 RPM at a max CFM
of forty eight point three features
include 12 RGB LEDs for quote majestic
illumination in the central hub and an
outer frame of CNC milled aluminum so
visually they're very similar to the
aluminum frame the Borah is that Leone
sent us for our 11 dynamic review I'm
sure we have some footage of that but
the frame on the new model is more
circular and over hands the edge of the
blades slightly so you can't actually
see the gap between the blade and the
fan frame which is just a visual thing
really most importantly they have normal
PWM and RGB headers rather than those
six pin connectors that only fitly on
the controllers and have been
there's all kinds of problems with their
existing fan lineup you can't use them
with anything else except for the Leone
controller so they fixed that the fans
are available in packs of three with a
six way fan splitter with pwm cable
through a RGB splitter and
anti-vibration pads the whole thing is
at 40 bucks for all of that so we may
cover that in our fan round up but
that's TBD and then final news item here
GPX ice blocks coming out for AMD and
video cards from alpha cool alpha cool
has announced the GPX ice block full
coverage GPU cooler for AMD and NVIDIA
cards the block includes a backplate
completely enclosing the PCB there are
two variants the 150 euro GPX plexi is
the fancier one with a large window and
RGB lighting while the 120 euro acetal
one is exactly the same but with a metal
cover and no lighting the RGB lighting
is compatible with the Asus biostar
gigabyte and msi alpha cool claims
performance of the two versions as
identical and the Pascal or Titan
version of the card and Vega versions
are also available now this is something
we saw briefly at PAX but they're now
finally coming out so you can check the
product listings for compatibility with
specific cards if you're interested in
that and then finally for hardware sales
for the week we've continued to notice
that prices are returning toward MSRP so
we'll link one of the cards that we
found in the description below they
change everyday so we're just gonna link
one of the 10 C's cards that's been on
sale lately and buy buy on sale sadly I
mean at MSRP ish so don't really want to
call it a sale when you're talking about
coming down from I don't know $300 over
MSRP so merely $50 over MSRP but it
seems like they're coming back down so a
link 1 below if you want to pick up a
video card at a reasonable ish price
then we'll have that link for you
otherwise we also noticed an acer 1440p
144 Hertz monitor for a little bit
cheaper than normally and an Intel 86
hundred K marked down by about 20 bucks
so not a huge sale there but something
worth pointing out
and these rise in CPUs and thread ripper
seem to have more or less normalized at
these new
our prices with the 1000 series now that
the 2000 season ship and honestly this
is something that we've wanted from
Intel for a long time because if you've
not noticed whenever Intel ships a new
generation of processors it seems like
the new gen and the old gen basically
the same price if you look from case Q
to case Q and Andy's actually dropped
the prices on the 1000 series CPUs with
the launch of the 2000 series and that's
what you would expect but that's not
what we've seen for the last five years
from Intel so at least those have
continued to follow or I have at least
stabilized at this point for AMD Rison
anyway that's it for this week as always
subscribe to get more coverage
throughout the week we have a lot of
really cool stuff coming up this week
and go to patreon.com/scishow sacks it
stops out directly go to store it on
cameras nexus net to pick up one of our
mod match or one of our glass crystals
the GM teardown logo laser etched in 3d
we now have an autographed one up there
as well also one quick thing Computex
will be happening soon so if you're not
subscribed to make sure you are because
that's where all the new PC hardware
news will be coming out for the next
year or so that's in about a week from
now thanks for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
