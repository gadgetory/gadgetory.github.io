thermaltake booth and we'll be looking
at a Sandia style cooler which is pretty
interesting it uses a much different
design than you used to looking at an
RGB illuminated AIO cooler and we'll
mention some of the P 3 and P 1 series
cases while we're going through here
before get into that this coverage is
brought to you by cyber power and
there's cyber XL gaming PC which has an
invertible motherboard tray layout learn
more at the link in the description
below so starting off with the AI oh
this is really not too different
fundamentally from what we've spoken
about a million times at this point it's
an AI o liquid cooler there are three
120 millimeter fans and they use the
rain version to RGB LED fans that we
talked about previously when visiting
thermal takes studio and offices in
Southern California what is different is
the pump so I can't lift this up too
much but we've got some b-roll of it and
the pump is actually just a prototype
there's no confirmation that this will
ever come to market but the idea is to
at a very top level at least create
illumination on the pump that will be
controllable theoretically the through
software just through the board
something like that and you may have
seen that on the kraken series coolers
that we reviewed recently the x2 so x 40
- 50 - 60 - same idea this just comes
down to will it be made basically but
same idea that would be a pretty serious
competitor to the kraken coolers will
look at thermals if the time comes but
for the sandia style cooler this one is
the engine 27 and this is a small
form-factor cooler it can cool somewhere
around 70 75 watts of power so it's not
built for hi I'm stuff obviously you
throw it on something like one of the
new i-5 non-case cue CPUs which have
about a 65 watt TDP something like this
would work for that the difference from
this versus normal coolers as you'll
notice in our b-roll is that the unit
does not use a traditional fan so it's
actually got aluminum fins in the center
and a kinetic bearing in the middle for
the rotation in these aluminum fins work
as a normal heatsink they sync the heat
but as they spin they're pushing the air
out through an outer aluminum
arrey and so then you're getting the
additional surface area and you're also
cooling it at the same time the bottom
of this one there are two versions one
is an aluminum base plate or cold plate
one's a copper cold plate the one I have
here is a copper cold plate and if we
look at the side it's got two layers of
copper with a layer of what looks like
aluminum in between and in this model
I'm told there's a heat pipe inside the
cold plate but it's not confirmed if
that will be final and make it to
production or not as far as the plate
itself that contacts the CPU that is a
protruded piece of copper which we've
generally found to perform at least a
little bit better than a flat piece of
copper so that's what we have for the
engine 27 no price on most of these
things and in 27 a prototype but will
probably come to market this is an
existing case it's got tempered glass on
it p5 there's also the p3 and we'll be
talking about the p1 next so I'll move
over there and now we're next to the
core p1 T G this is a mini ITX version
of the p3 in the p5 and in that and to
that end it has the same feature set for
the most part with obviously just being
a bit shrunken the p1 TG can mount to
your wall just like the p3 the p5 could
can't mount it to the wall in the
Venetian maybe get pretty mad but it is
wall mountable otherwise the main
feature set is a semi modular layout for
the chassis the frame itself and that
starts here with the video card where
you've got the framing and a PCIe riser
cable so that the video card can be
facing it with the front plate out which
is really just for visibility there's no
other functional add to that other than
just being able to see the front of the
card if you don't like that just with as
with the other case you pull that out
switch the card mount into the PCIe saw
on the motherboard just like normally
and in terms of fitment it can fit any
size wheel cart because really there's
no side panel to the case it just shoots
straight out but any cards should be
contained within that space there are
the stainless standoffs here for the
glass and then the tempered glass mounts
straight to the front of that though
we've removed it for video purposes this
has a full custom loop mounted to it and
there's a plate down here where you can
actually adjust in terms of z-depth how
the reservoir is
in the case there's a radiator in this
particular build it looks like about a
240 millimeter radiator mounted in its
own compartment back here and then the
tubes are routed to the CPU GPU all that
stuff has expected cable management
happens behind the board tray and then
for power supplies there can be a full
ATX form factor power supply that about
covers that there's no price that I have
right now for this case we'll have more
