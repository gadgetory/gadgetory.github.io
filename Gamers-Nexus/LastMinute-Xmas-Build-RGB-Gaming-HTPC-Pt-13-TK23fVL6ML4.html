shouldn't be hard but I need to find
those a mini ITX case and components
because it's too late to order things in
time for Christmas I'm trying to do a PC
build for my sister who else with some
of the game benchmarks on the site and
we need to replace her gaming htpc
including Mini ITX case we're gonna try
and scavenge parts and put all that
together before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by catalyst
energy Mint's which contain caffeine
taurine b vitamins and siberian
Eleuthera root learn more about this
zero calorie energy drink alternative in
the link in the description below
use code gamers nexus for a discount so
this will serve two purposes one is the
last-minute build I'm trying to get this
done might have enough time to do two
days shipping on a few things if I don't
have them but we're trying to replace a
system that has a trinity APU and it's a
5800 K I think it's while since I've
looked in those parts and it's got a GTX
960 which might stay in there because
it's actually kind of decent card and
she's able to play right now watchdogs
too with high-ish settings at 1080p and
get sort of high 30s low 40s fps that's
not great the system is aging the
trinity apu is dragging everything else
down so the GP is not bad so we're gonna
try and rebuild things you'll get a mini
office tour while we're doing it so
first I need some RGB LEDs and
personally I don't really put those in
my system but she's a big fan of neon
lights this is the closest thing I got
so we've got a few options one is I have
these Corsair SP 120 RGB kits that are
going unused right now they sent two of
them because the one that shipped with
this 570 X was defective because it was
a a pre-production model so this is one
option we're gonna hang on to this
another option of course would be the
competing and the XE hue plus I haven't
actually set one of these up myself I've
used the one on the 570 X we'll try this
out but the hue plus is the next option
so we're gonna go grab one of those and
in addition to that look for a CPU a
motherboard I think we can skip the
video card as ds1 in there I ordered a
hard drive I was ahead
the game there had we needed an SSD and
a case and a power supply we need
everything let's get behind it so first
grab the Hugh plots in case we want to
use that instead and see the collection
of empty boxes for in Tana and these CDs
so we like to have those for the tables
during shots so I've got the cute plus
and we've got the SP RGB kit you're
gonna have to blur that out
okay CPUs so I think we're gonna go if
we go Intel I might have a spare Intel
chip 35 70s that was never used as a
low-power Ivy Bridge chip it's basically
built for HD bc's let's set that aside
you might be able to go into that if not
got a 4770k in the other room which I am
trying to hang on to but that's the
last-minute option we use the Ivy Bridge
or if we use the Haswell 4770k the
benefit is ddr3 which doesn't sound like
a benefit but when RGB LEDs are one of
my biggest points of concern we've got
some decent memory somewhere in one of
these with a few kits of LED enabled
memory I can only spare one I think but
I'll walk you through what we have so
for ddr3 we have HyperX savage g.skill
this is pretty bad this is 1600 or 1333
mega Hertz I think this is good I like
this memory but that's for a permanent
test bench cannot put that in anything
else
vengeance pro memory which is decent but
not LEDs so no good for our purposes
some a data mediocre kid memory
this is like ddr4 with the corsair LED
stuff so it could potentially use that
more corsair LED stuff that's the other
half the kit these two i suspect are bad
so we can't use those HyperX beast and
then the one that I'm most interested in
we have these g.skill modules that I
bought for my machine that I never built
so those haven't been put to use ancient
Genesis memory this looks like beast as
well this looks like predator and then
we have a single stick of crappy Ram
Michael talked about and then we've got
these two of extra modules it's been out
for a little while now but I think they
have some of the best LEDs I've seen on
memory she's killed just announced some
new stuff but this will probably be
better so I think this will work I think
we can use this for our LED needs in
this particular build and my hope is to
put something together that kind of
resembles like a mixture of the Tron
movies for LEDs so get a bit of Tron in
there I get some cyberpunk feel and I
think that memory and a mini ITX board
we can only have two slots anyway so
that'll work for that if we run the 35
70's we're gonna be limited to off top
my head something like what is it 2130
it might even only be 1600 megahertz but
definitely no higher than 21 33 so we
might get to 21 33 but certainly no
higher than that and we're on ddr3 so
now we need to figure out a couple of
other things how do we need to figure
out now okay so we have thinking the
cube plus the reason I think in the hue
plus is because if I can find a crack
and cooler that we can use then we can
connect them together the problem is the
crack and smallest size is 140 and
that's not gonna fit in the case that I
think I want which is in in 1 901
I emailed in when a few days ago and
asked for this case they said they would
ship one and I haven't gotten an update
so to their credit it was very
last-minute
on my part
but I really don't think I'm gonna get
one in time for Christmas so I think we
bunch of the sex might have to order a
system
and but then we have the cracking
problem so the crack and only the crack
and X no the X 52 won't fit in here
either
X 52 0 to 40 that's not gonna fit so we
can fit a 120 millimeter fan in here so
that means this is a pretty good-looking
case from any ITX right now we have the
Silverstone case we have this one in use
right now for that gaming htpc but it's
not flashing up so I do want something
with tempered glass this will work into
the backup option I'd love to look and
see what I have so we ordered this
that's an option now the problem is
those liquid cooler I wants not gonna
fit because the liquid cooler I want
doesn't exist
so what we need is an X 32 which doesn't
exist at least not in the US so I need a
120 millimeter radiator and ideally an
RGB pump but I don't know if while both
those so I I'll pause the radiators
we'll see what I have then figure out
the rest so you know 120 millimeter
radiator ideally somehow we figure out
the LED pump solution this is what I got
for about half of the liquid coolers
that we have right now so we've got
plenty of 120 s this is an EVGA hybrid
solution which might come in use if I
want to convert the video card into a
liquid card later that's that's an idea
would reduce the noise levels even if
it's a 960 which doesn't need it to
reduce the noise that's an option for
that but we can maybe splice one of
these with a crack and pump block or
something and create a last minute crack
in X 32 this is a phat 120 radiator so
it is 120 it would work within 1 901
which is what we want to use and it
cools about as well as some of the two
40s because it is fatter this is a
terrible garbage awful Coolermaster
solution that
is not getting used in this build haha
and then what else do we have a couple
different generations of a stack pumps
this is an older one I'm not sure what
this is attached to maybe a 550 LC or
something but you can see because it's
fatter this is a previous gen ACE attack
pump so this is a bit older and then
we've then we've got a these bad boys I
think this might be a 420 radiator bit
large considering we can only fit 120
put this put a little bit over the lemon
we've got 420 hit 360s in here if we
were building a larger system okay so
that's that's an idea well kind of set
this aside I think we can potentially
dig from here if necessary and hack
together a solution with the LED pump
plate from a crackin em in one of these
and ripped the tubes off the barbs try
and fill it and put them together not a
great solution but a possible one and we
don't have a lot of time anyway so now
we need to figure out the case check
your inventory I guys hopefully got 9:01
but if we can't get it I will see what I
have
so this is what we want and don't have
here's what we have don't necessarily
want so four cases all of these are
cases
twenty-something K is 28 cases maybe I'm
gonna say we go with an Tek cubes an
option it's not really flashing off
corby ones an option if you don't know
what that was
there's a core v1 could do that it's got
three panels that you can switch around
so I could put a glass panel on the top
that would look straight down at the
pump plate which would hopefully be RGB
that's a baby pig maybe on that and the
Xing Manta I forgot that exists and I
forgot that I have one but we do in fact
have an NZXT Manta and it is the red
black one that's all that's all I got
other than video cards so okay so here's
our Manto that we used in the review
ages ago and it is a pretty nice looking
case I may have used the phrase bloated
whale when I was describing it
originally but it's grown on me
especially when this is one of our only
options okay so let's let's see if we
get this in win one if I do the in one
case then we would have to have pass to
me get it here I can't do that
it's the 21st technically so you have
today if we do two days we'd be in 160
for the caves fifty for shipping that's
kind of brutal would we even get it on
time okay so we did two days $160 on the
case
$50 on shipping and we get on the 27th
that's no good
$80 get by the 23rd that puts our order
up to 240 dollars for a case don't think
I'm okay with that
so can wait for n1 and they probably
won't get it here in time so I asked too
late or we can pull something out of
this list I'm gonna say we pull the S
the nothing SD for you where's it say we
pull the manta for now which is located
in the Attic come on I've got it
catalogued as long-term storage which
means it's not in plans to be tested
anymore okay let's go pull the Manta and
then if the N word one comes in time
great if not we'll be using the manta
which is not a bad case and gives us a
glass side panel so I can position it in
a way that all the LEDs will be visible
and that'll look nice anyway so we're
gonna go into some of the inventory
which is the Attic
manses conveniently right here so you
gotta get this down pleasant noise okay
I just tagged this we just started that
inventory system that you saw that is
brand-new this it's only got cases and
video cards in it right now there are a
lot of cases you figure out what
motherboard and CPU were using so we use
this case we can actually get away with
using mm-hmm
next 42 and I wouldn't have to do
anything crazy and try and make an X 32
let's go with that plan for now
Molly bored Ram we have RAM RAM right
here RAM we can put all this away
z170 is the 170 X 99 z170 is he 170 88
97 z97 that was supposed to be for my
bill that I never did
oops ah you want 70 mini ITX which would
be perfect if I could spare it but I
can't we need that for the site there is
however each 77 motherboard that has not
moved since I bought it some years ago
to use with the 35 70s it never did you
can see there's a there's a thread here
common thread between my mind Everest
build systems and then ending up doing
everything just for GN and not ever
building computers that I want to build
so we're gonna do that now we're gonna
actually be able to use this board in
theory it works bought it and never used
it there's an H 77 Mini ITX board that's
not bad-looking that's an okay looking
board little pretty gross
okay so cool we have a motherboard
motherboard we have a CPU now we need a
power supply and drive which I just
bought the drive the other day 4
terabyte drive she has used consistently
every year below there all the space on
the drive so I'm going to upgrade it to
a 4 terabyte drive and this is one of
the new ones I haven't tried yet
I really should benchmark it before I
apparently put it away in the system
I've got one of those
we need a boot drive yes we need a drive
for test for now so let's let's take all
this in the other room
and I have a an SSD that we can use
that's already built for Ivy Bridge and
we can just deploy it instantly to see
if everything works and if everything
works then the next step is to start the
cloning process and clone your existing
data onto these devices and then hope
it will windows will survive a
transplant from AMD to Intel and if it
does we're good if it doesn't I really
don't want to install a new OS and
environment because once someone's kind
of embedded in there is you don't want
to uproot that that's it's like Merry
Christmas also here's a new OS for you
to learn and good luck finding all your
files so we're gonna try and avoid that
but let's let's get this started I need
a power supply back in the room we have
a photon 650 80 plus gold higher
efficiency ratings probably better for
this build since it's an HP PC ideally
something with a passive cooling I don't
think any of you just have that I know
max could do that but okay well he is
one of these so we have all the parts
now it's just a matter of building it
and that's what we're gonna be doing in
the next part first of all a couple of
options here I could upgrade the video
card the 960 that's in there is pretty
good but I might be able to scavenge
something better we'll see I think I
might have an old 780 it might be a bit
better than the 960 the next problem is
going to be liquid cooling I do want to
liquid cool the CPU for the visual
effect but the GPU is gonna burn up in
that case depending on what I use and
what cooler it has so I might end up
liquid cooling a GPU you want to stick
around for that but yeah the build is
part two we'll benchmark and do the file
transfer and then challenges that may
arise and I'm sure they will her eyes as
they always do
