master-race panel at PAX East 2018 we
were on the panel along with bit wit
Kyle and this is an uncut version of the
panel you can watch it start to finish
here we're also going to do a supercut
version with some highlights from some
of the questions that Kyle and I tackled
including discussions on GPP and things
like that that will be coming up later
although all the same answers are
included in this full-length video if
you refer this one so my name is Tracy
and I am the community manager at
Coursera and I will be moderating this
panel but these guys all here are the
stars of the show so we will start off
just asking I'll ask them some general
questions and we'll open it up for Q&amp;amp;A
for any of you guys to ask questions
later on you might have seen a postcard
on the bond when you entered so
everybody who's here is going to get a
PCM our birthday pin is that cool now I
know those weren't the pins themselves
but if you just fill out the card put
your name your email everything and come
to the Corsair booth any time for the
rest of the weekend they will give you a
pin if you bring this card in and if you
will not be here for the rest of the
weekend find us
after the panel not here in the room but
we'll be right outside and we'll give
you a pin now if you won't be here for
the rest of the weekend but if you will
be come to the Corsair booth it's that
first booth right when you go down the
escalators if you guys haven't seen it
already so I will go ahead and get
started with everybody so first let's do
some introductions so we'll start down
here with you Kevin
tell us your name your handle what you
do and tell us what your favorite thing
about PC gaming is so hi everybody my
name is Kevin some of you might know me
as Noor room ooh I currently am the
Radeon community manager at AMD and I
handle a lot of our social channel stuff
and I'm also the lead community manager
for our AMD Red Team if anyone is a
member of that which you all should be
previously you might recognize my handle
I used to work at Kingston and HyperX
and at Coolermaster years ago as well
and so I've been around shilling for
everyone but yeah and my favorite thing
about PC gaming is options like how's it
going everyone I'm Kyle I have a youtube
channel called bit wit it's a PCT DIY
tech focused channel and we basically do
you know hardware reviews a lot of
testing we do the occasional sketch
comedy that has to do with tech we like
to keep things casual and light-hearted
we will occasionally blog that's that's
great popular on YouTube right now and
like just lots plays and a bunch of
other stuff but my favorite thing about
PC gaming is probably the social element
being able to interact with people and
meet new people online from the comfort
of your own home in your underwear hey
I'm Steve from gamers Nexus and the
opposite of casual and don't believe in
fun basically we do highly technical
computer hardware reviews and everything
about PC gaming has seen how stuff works
graphics options and stuff like that
okay George oh yeah hi I'm Gloria
Stewart I make memes for a living
I don't know how that happened but I'm
really grateful for it and yeah I worked
for a questioner as well
somehow they pay me to do that and I
haven't told them that's a bad idea yet
hopefully they're not here so but ya
know I've really enjoyed doing it and I
can I think the part I love the most
about PC gaming is it's a commitment you
know you buy a PC game and you own it
for life and that means a lot to me and
the audience and the people who are into
PC gaming it's a long-term commitment
you don't unload how to build a PC so
hello everyone my name is Phaedra I come
from Portugal so please excuse my accent
well I'm the founder of PC master race i
found a pc master a seven years ago and
it's a wonderful community i hope many
of you are part of it if you're not
maybe you will consider becoming part of
it I hope we we can we can we can make
you be be part of it
well one what concerns PC gaming I think
the tweaking is the best part the fact
that you can make a PC in your own image
regard regard regardless of your tastes
you can try to go for Beauty over power
the power over beauty and really make it
your own
I think that's very special about PC
gaming and you can find that anywhere
else
I'm Frances you probably know me as I am
one of the senior moderators on PC mark
but like Pedro one of the things that I
really like about PC gaming is the
customizability and I guess the freedom
actually I you know everything I am the
person that voids warranties and to have
a platform that lets me do that without
incurring you know network bands from
say police station I guess also network
commands for Microsoft having having a
platform to make it that really is
special so before we dive into the
questions here just to give you guys a
little background about PCMR maybe
George or Pedro you guys can kind of
explain how many of you are PC users or
active PC gamers I would hope everybody
in this audience would be good and how
many of you are like active community
members or follow the subreddit are PCMR
okay good good quite a few of you so for
those of you who may not be as familiar
but you know you're into PC gaming you
like PC building and are kind of just
curious about this panel maybe one of
you guys could explain a little bit more
about it of what PCMR is the red the red
there's a subreddit yeah so pcmr is a
community of dedicated PC gamers and
enthusiasts and also these people who
don't even want to
see but want to get into it it welcomes
everybody and there are over 1 million
300,000 subscribers on it currently on
reddit reddit if you haven't been to it
is the 4th most visited website in the
United States and so it's been growing
really crazily and it's a really great
community of dedicated fans but I think
Pedro can say more and by the way I want
to thank him for being here because no
one's ever seen Pedro before in person
and I thought he was Keyser s√∂ze and
then I met him in person and if I find
out later that he's actually a spy
that's gonna make a lot of sense because
it still is like unreal that you're here
so yeah but I think you can explain what
the PCMR is to you I think a little
better yeah Temari is what you want to
make of it everyone has their general
idea about PC gaming what we are and we
try to be everyday as a friendly
community we we want to be a place where
everyone can share anything remotely PC
related without any special fears we
like to have a lot of fun as most of you
know the members of the community know
friendly banter we we laugh at ourselves
as well as we laugh at others sometimes
all in a friendly manner but that's I
think that's the bottom part of what BCM
areas we are a friendly community will
we welcome everyone who wants to to to
learn a bit more about what it is to to
game and not only game on PC sometimes
people forget that PC amaizing just
about gaming some people don't really
like Amy but they like the the tweaking
the building pcs the technology or they
just use PCs for their work for their
anything not for gaming and that's
important too and I think that's the
bottom line of what we are we were
created it's about seven years ago I
don't think there was a place at the
time quite like this place there wasn't
exclusively about technology all
business that existed were a bit too
tech not that that it's bad but you miss
that the parts of the the fun part of
being a be seen to Siesta memes we have
the meme master here with us and I think
we we together we've changed throughout
the years but
we can hopefully continue to grow as we
have I I hope you you enjoy the
community and if you don't we were here
to listen to what you have to say about
it and perhaps maybe make some changes
awesome so my my next question is kind
of for all of you what is it that
attracted you guys to PC building PC
gaming or just being part of the PCM art
community what do you like most about it
Morrowind I I built I built my first PC
for morrowind I'm a huge fan of the
Elder Scrolls series I was playing it on
xbox I was big Halo fan all that stuff
growing up all console gaming but then
like I had a friend who had a decent
half decent gaming PC who later got me
into things like Ultima Online and all
that my wife just sunk but anyway he
loaded up more windows in his machine
and I was like astounded by like how
much better it looked on his rig than it
did on Xbox and so I was like let's go
let's do this and so I totally did and
the first thing I remember after getting
my break together getting in the game
loaded up that game opens up you're like
on a boat you walk into the town and
stuff I just remember how good the water
looked compared to Xbox and then like
three weeks ago I loaded up more wins
just because I was feeling like it and
I'm like wow this water looks awful but
morrowind it's beautiful answer so I
actually first got into PC building and
in that whole community after I got a
job at new egg it was my first job out
of college new eggs kind of like the PC
hardware version of Amazon for those of
you who don't know and within the first
couple months of getting a job there I
learned a lot of what I know now the PC
hardware from a guy named Paul who has
his own YouTube channel Paul's hardware
and he taught me a lot of stuff and I
just started getting really engaged in
it to the point where I was like I want
to build my own computer
I want to do it I'm surrounded by all
this hardware now you've told me all the
benefits I know how to do it I want to
do it so I remember I bought all my
parts and brought him home one day and I
just assemble the whole thing watching
Paul's tutorial on YouTube it's very
good still till this day and I just
remember the feeling of booting it for
the first time watching all the fans
spin up and the lights turned on it's
it's pretty cliche but it was like it
was like lighting up the Christmas tree
on Christmas morning or whatever there
was something magical about it and then
and I was like wait now I get to game on
it this is even better like it just kept
going and then I've kind of been hooked
on it ever since
hence the I think probably fridge off
your answer Jedi Academy was I played a
lot of Caesar 3 and stuff like that the
city builders but when I started my Jedi
Knight Jedi Academy I think that's when
I discovered modding so texture packs
and skins for characters which is also I
think where I learned what a zip file
was how to use it to mop the game so
that was probably the major stepping
stone and then morrowind I don't
remember four more when it came out
before or after if I played that as well
I had a different experience from you
I love morrowind however when I started
the game you talk about you know the
boat on water and all that none of the
water rendered for it
it may have been beautiful for some of
us no that was when I discovered I
needed to replace the video card I think
I think I think that's that was my first
experience with changing Hardware parts
specifically to play a game because it
just didn't work so it's one of those
you know you start in it because out of
necessity I guess in my case and then
find out that actually this is really
cool and a lot of fun actually I just
wanted to pass real quick 1v1 invested
yeah I came a little bit later for me I
started with which Tracy dancer event
and the star crafts got me hooked I was
in my bedroom for a long time playing
that and then you know I think that yeah
that brought me into it and then a
half-life came out a half-life 2 and
that that was like wow I guess this is
where I live now so yeah I actually used
to be a big Xbox gamer a long time ago I
was big into the Gears of War community
and they got to a point where I realized
man like it would be nice if I could
keep these games every time there's a
new console generation I had to sell
everything and after doing that once I
was just like no I'm not doing this
again so then I dedicated myself to PC
and here we are my answer isn't as
glamorous
think I started with PC gaming in the
late 80s I was I was maybe four or five
years old
was that a system that I I don't think
it was very popular in America is called
the ZX Spectrum not sure if many of you
have heard about this system what
brought me into it was the fact that you
can actually code your own games
you bought magazines and you could the
games in I think Sinclair basic like a
variation of the base thing but the
basic coding language and you could
create small games and that complexity
is something you really couldn't have in
any other kind of system later on and in
the the early 90s on what concerns
mainstream gaming one can can argue that
there wasn't any very obvious advantages
about gaming on PCs compared consoles or
arlynn concerns mainstream gaming but
the more complex games were exclusive to
be see as they mostly still are today
games like civilization the first
civilization civilization - Ultima like
a game that wasn't popular helix
championship manager games about
managing football teams you call it
soccer that brought me into this and you
really can't can't do that in any other
system it's just too complex it's
impossible almost impossible to control
that a property bar the proper Mouse and
it really it brought me into to to PC
gaming my answer is I'm not sure but I I
started out with PC gaming like you know
why do nowadays by fixing things I work
and I have a very a very long history
with doing so
I remember probably when I was maybe
five or six years old
my parents they had an old IBM PC I
don't remember anything he tells about
it but they tell me that at one point
they couldn't get to turn on and you
know I was able to figure it out but it
was just sort of like that hands-on
feeling that wow I can actually I can
actually change this I can make all of
it run that's more coming onto PC
generally but what really got me into PC
gaming per se was hey I have always for
a number of years I went to a summer
camp and they had a Mac lab that's my
name freak
the adamak lab and when we were finished
doing our work we would all load up the
demo version of halo combat Evolved and
we would have a glorious you know lamb
parties and it was just that communal
feeling of being able to physically
punch the person who killed you it
really ignited a love for PC gaming and
that really lived the games came and
went
I played Sim City a whole lot we
actually can imagine the competitive Sim
City yeah how do you even do you just
compete in building as fast as you can
well it was run by a group called future
cities
the details but essentially they wanted
at the time they want kids to begin
gaming into architecture engineering
city planning and some see was kind of
sorry I was just curious it was really a
lot of simulation one building I I got
my hands on I I cracked it it became
mine and then you know Steam for Mac
came out tf2 came with a star playing
man and well here I am I I can't leave
so my next question any of you guys can
answer you don't all have to but I'm
curious how you guys see with the
current our current culture and gaming
do you think that gaming culture has
shifted more towards PC gaming or do you
still think there's a really solid
console gamer community or do you think
maybe PC gaming is a lot more relevant
now than it was what do you guys think
yeah let me start well I think many of
you will remember how it was a few years
ago the dark times of PC gaming when
when gaming on PC was considered its
consider it's not truly so but
considered to be very hard to set up
no only very complex games are on DC of
course that's a lie but that's what's
what people thought it was I don't think
we took too much attention people didn't
notice as much and I think that has
changed tremendously in the last I say
four or five years
yeah you don't have a crisis I mean
everyone knows that hand builds PC that
can ruin crisis even today it's simply
hospitals and there was love to be it at
the time over whether or not it was
possible you had a scientists at CERN
and you know they they were studying it
they were trying to figure out how can
we run this you know ten twenty ten 1280
by 1024 on ultra settings I don't think
any PC can can run crisis right now at
Ultra no but what I think is is now we
are here and we're here to stay I think
and I think everyone is taking notice of
BC as a platform and I think that's only
good if if companies if a personality is
cater to us we'll probably all have a
better experience so that's the win I
think that's great
I think as far as PC gaming currently vs
consoles first of all I guess there's
nothing wrong with playing on consoles
it's totally valid
I don't know that PC gaming has been
smaller than consoles in terms of market
share for a number of years I think
last I checked 2013 PC surpassed the
three major consoles combined and
software revenue per game sales so we in
terms of the PC community has been ahead
of consoles for a while I don't think
there's anything wrong with playing on
consoles or anything like that but I
guess as far as dark times the current
memory and graphics card market probably
is not too great for growth of PC gaming
we can kind of see that on on the
reviewer or in your case influence I
don't know I don't know if you seen this
but you know you track billion sales
right through Amazon or whatever else
yeah and I've definitely seen a
downtrend and I grabbed his card in my
references and things like that
and a downtrend in memory capacity to
most of our users bought 16 gigabytes
two years ago and now they're on eight
so PC gaming is in good health but also
the current current markets not good
yeah and I think that's definitely true
the state of PC gaming is rough right
now you know all the crazy mining stuff
and shortages with video memory and
whatnot but I think it's temporary I
think eventually things will get better
for us and it's interesting that you
bring up like the software sales
combined for for all the consoles didn't
even you know out wave for PC and then
you kind of wonder like well then why do
I keep seeing like Xbox and PlayStation
for ads everywhere and like where's all
the PC stuff I think it's because like
those are like finished goods you know
like with a PC or you're literally
combining eight or nine or ten
components together and it's kind of
harder to sell a single part of
something bigger to a mainstream
audience because they're like what's the
motherboard do you know right yeah it's
blood back but you know I think in the
grand scheme of things I feel like
people are drawn to gaming now more than
ever because of the like I mentioned
earlier like social interaction and I
feel like that's taking place at a much
faster rate and a much more effective
rate on the PC platform because you know
the advent of social media and online
gaming and just the ability to do more
on the PC platform you can stream you
know I mean obviously you can you can
stream very much more effectively on PC
you have multiple monitors like you were
saying options right you have options
and I think people are eventually are
slowly catching on to that so I think
even though we're in
hatch right now we're still overall
growing yeah so unlike maybe some other
communities some would say that PC
gaming or just PCMR is almost like a
lifestyle more than anything else it's
not just you know it's not just a fandom
it's our life how would you guys say
that you know PC gaming has defined my
[Laughter]
professional life so yeah I also live on
and drive and move around computers for
a living I thought I was joking I was
being serious
I same thing I mean every every hour
every day is something to do with
computers mostly you know mostly
work-related I like doing it but also I
wouldn't say defines my life for my
lifestyle as much as is my life
so what about for you guys so you guys
are all on PCMR all the time I mean
George is browsing reddit at work like
90% I'm sorry on it right now
but how did you guys say like that that
pcmr has really impacted your life I
think the biggest way that well PC
gaming itself has directed directly
impacted my life based on you can tell
what might my finance when they
fluctuate based on when their steam
sales that's that's been on health that
or one like there's a new graphics card
release but yeah I think it's just it's
kind of opened my eyes to a larger
community and that's why I spend all my
time there so well on a personal basis
I'm here and this is my first time in in
this country and I'm honored to be here
so it's changed my life it has
thank you
I think disregarding the personal part I
think when you are a PC not just gamer
but enthusiast it says a little bit
about other facets of your life because
you're a person who probably doesn't
care abouts losing maybe a few minutes
of your time so as to improve everything
around you like you you like to tweak
you like to make things around you
better and you're not afraid to do so
you like the hassle it's not a hassle
for you and I think that says a lot
about you and your personality I also
work directly my life is sort of
dominated by PCs but that's for PC Amara
so made so many stories its PC more has
really been it's been shaping force on
my life just it's open well first being
a mod it's opened my eyes to a lot of
wealth back and forth from the industry
but that in itself is something that
comes with the territory but where it
really where things changed in ways I
didn't expect was the skills that I
gained from it so as as I mentioned I
work in IT and a lot of the stuff they
learn building pcs you know
experimenting with different
configurations different software all
the hassles of tweaking it directly
actually impact it big words what are
they they directly impacted my ability
to problem-solve to figure out what's
going on
one example would be Auto modeling I am
one of the if you guys have ever
interacted with the PC amar you've
probably run to automata here there we
have some really complex code and it's
scary enough I was actually the person
who wrote a good chunk it really is a
terrifying thought when you think about
but the skills I gained from that mostly
especially regular expressions
legitimate stuff that actually makes
money helps people jobs perhaps the
health care industry may be a little
safe fifty million people would be dead
right now it wasn't for PCMR okay so I
do have more questions that I want to
ask but we have about thirty minutes
left in the panel so I really want to
open it up to questions from you guys so
if anybody in the audience has questions
now is the time to raise your hand I
don't know do we have a mic oh so if you
want to just come up should we have
inline what do you guys think
how about how do we have you line up and
ask questions that would be awesome
and then we'll if there's more time I'll
ask the rest of my question if you if
you say first I will kill you
first why is your favorite hardware and
Wizards favorite software modification
[Laughter]
clearly otherwise I'm gonna get it
apparently
hardware modification I guess the the
first one I did is probably my favorite
I had an aunt Ike I think it's called
the super land boy I came out in early
2000s and had an acrylic panel on it
the system was having over temperature
issues so I took a 120 millimeter hole
saw and drilled some holes into the
acrylic panel and that's where the
thermal testing started so that's why my
favorite modification on hardware Vera
modification on software I I guess would
just be all the testing tools we have in
the house we've written a lot of those
internally so that's just all your
Python and batch files and stuff like
that's really cool to see it all work
and especially weird a lot of my
favorite stuff that like software or
hardware modifications I can't talk
about because they end up becoming
official so like I did a lot of software
work to help we have an integration with
farcry now for Corsair hardware so if
you have our latest software it'll all
be lighting and your PC will change to
match the game and I did a lot of work
on that and now it's now it's a real
thing so I don't I don't even know what
I get to call it a mod because it's yeah
it's a product now yeah yeah I did I had
this case that I rebuilt my PC for when
I moved off to college that I can't
remember it was like a thermal take
armor or a cooler master 1/2 case one of
those two because that you know that was
cool full towers at the time and it had
this blue LED that was in the front that
was like 6 million lumens or something
and it aimed directly at my bed at night
and it didn't lit up the room it was too
much and at the time I was working in an
electronics lab in the campus and I had
access to like all of our ordering
guides and so I totally ordered like
these purple LEDs which are really
expensive for LEDs by the way like red
LEDs are like maybe 3 cents if you're
buying in bulk purple are like 7 I know
I know it's nuts and so I bought this
like purple LED cuz purple doesn't
really translate well for LEDs and it's
great because replacing that was my
favorite part of our mod of all time
software for my first iPhone for like
iPhone 3 or something like that
I totally jail broke the thing back when
that was a thing that was relevant and I
ripped out all the sounds from the PC
version of Final Fantasy 7
and modded all the files in the iPhone 4
with frontal fancy 7 noises like all the
lots all the chimes like everything was
all fine at least 7 and I made my own
like graphical interface board and stuff
too well not quite PC but you know I
used the PC version of a game that was
closed down I'll be pretty quick my my
heart my favorite part where mod isn't
too exciting because I'm not huge in
modding I wish it was better at it but
when I put together my first custom
water-cooled system known as hotline I
had to do a lot of spray-painting and
sort of get used to spray painting and
and figure out like the best way to do
it because I've never really worked with
it before and I remember just going into
my garage and hanging up like a stream
line you know basically across like two
unused dressers and hanging like the
thermal armor of my my AC stuff
motherboard ex x99 motherboard up there
and I just went to town and like you
know spray-painted for like the whole
day even though it probably should have
taken five minutes so now both of those
dressers are half gray but the system
came out awesome and I was really happy
with the results totally worth it
software mods actually when I was like
in middle school or maybe high school I
had an iPod Touch and I basically
photoshopped a custom icon for every
single app in game every game every app
that I had on there I think like half
the apps were just like different
versions of my face I remember just
people would freak out and say hey
that's weird but I got a huge kick out
of it well let me stop
well I think I'm not too big in mind
like you so right now I'm trying to RGV
everything on my on my desktop so that's
a project going on that's my favorite
part of my currents a busy life right
now
software wise I think modding games I
think most of us here have done so in
one way or another some more than others
I myself I think oblivion not Morrowind
oblivion I might it so hard that I think
that the Golden Horse armor was the the
most sober thing I think of the game
that was pretty nice the biggest one for
me would be the time I tried to mod an
Xbox 360 into gaming easy I've got all
the parts I was researching you know
airflow and pcie risers the smallest
power supplies it can match them and I I
wondered how you use a dremel I I can i
I'm just going to briefly introducting
say that I hate with the burning passion
the watches that Microsoft uses on the
Xbox 360 they can go die in a fire
anyways the project was a total failure
but the PC lives on mods I mostly would
be just digging really deep into Windows
and in this you know tweaking it
actually do I want to do that's hard
that's really hard Microsoft to make it
better thank you for your question for
the sake of time just for all you guys
asking questions you just say who the
question is directed towards or if it's
for everybody could say everybody but if
nobody you don't want the answer you
don't have to but yeah how's it going
guys my question is for the three on the
right over here
do you think that with the really
surprising in the past year and the
level of I pcs and clockspeed it's at
are we going to see improvements in the
coming year with the release of rise
into and do you think that AMD throwing
their hat in the ring again is gonna
increase some competition in the cpu
market and maybe awakens a little bit in
the place their toothpaste
[Laughter]
thank you
this question is for the guys in the
left few gutters could mu Nvidia
I really didn't hear AMD or Nvidia over
this where ever gives you the best bang
for the buck at the specific time I mean
you know you know what you what you can
spend you know what what you are trying
to achieve and I really think it should
be a fanboy for any for any of them or
any on it or any brand at all you should
buy whatever is best for you at that
specific time which may be different
later on but just as a choose what's
better right now basically what Pedro
said practically speaking I've mostly
been I actually I when I was younger and
more naive I would switch back and forth
it would be based on whatever the last
unit I had that sale so at some point
the graphics card doesn't work anymore
where it's not as good and then I would
say no I'm not doing that again I'm
gonna go to the other side and I went
back and forth for years currently I'm
on NVIDIA but I'm probably gonna be
switching the AMD
thank you
hi this is a question for Duke Kevin um
last year at PAX I was the one wearing
that AMD hat at the Intel booth it was
on reddit and it had like four thousand
votes I never got a check for that where
is that
I'll connect you with our finance team
they're much nicer than I am on a more
serious question though this for all of
you like what do you guys what's your
stance on like brand loyalty like
basically like I personally hate like
how people put like AMD versus a video
or AMD versus Intel like what are your
stats is on that so many questions you
can't answer specifically you I have
nothing wrong with people having a
preference I think it's it's good to
share your preferences with other people
because that might inspire them for
influence then to make a decision that
works for them but I think it's at the
point when you start feeling superior
over somebody else's choice I think
that's you know some of the toxicity
that can exist in the community that we
typically try to do without so yeah you
know to tell people that you're proud of
your hardware and be you know computer
hardware and and don't don't knock them
for using their choice of hardware just
because it works for them yeah I think
Pedro feels the same way say if you
don't huh but yeah you definitely don't
you don't ever want to knock somebody
for what they don't have or for what
they do have even as far as me I I
worked really hard to inspire brand
loyalty and I think it's an opinion of
everyone at Corsair that loyalties
earned so we want people to be loyal but
if we don't earn it what good is that so
really that's true you should be loyal
to the people who treat you well if
you're happy why not stay but I think
that any any specific time you have to
study the market and see and see what's
the best choice for you because it can
change like every other week we've seen
lately unfortunately with the GPU prices
and and we know that although you might
have a preference and many people do
have a preference
sometimes the grass might be greener on
the other side but if if you're happy in
your content and if you are treated well
why not stay thank you so you guys
mention before that PC has a hard time
advertising versus consoles because PCs
are a lot of different parts well
consoles are like a finished product
what do you think about firms like
Microsoft releasing like prepared gaming
rigs in the future just as directed
anybody isn't that wouldn't it be the
same as a as a pre film like a prebuilt
machine or I wasn't aware we had those
well yeah you can get a for instance of
course there make something called the
Corsair one and it's a entire machine
that comes ready to play games you just
install looking you want on it
so but those are called pre-built and
the PC communities there's a little bit
of a split there's some people who they
really don't like pre builds and I think
it's because they really really love
building that pcs and they think doing
anything else would be not as good or a
rating more expensive than those people
who like pre builds because it's easier
so yeah that exists I didn't really the
point that was made was that there's no
such thing as an ad for PC gaming by
itself which when he said that yeah Kyle
said that I immediately wrote down I was
like we should start making ads just for
PC gaming I'm just trying to start
thinking what that would look like and
how we could get that on the internet
actually is an example of PC advertising
and he probably noticed a bit more about
than I do
but uh around III there's the PC gaming
show hosted by Andy it's pretty much the
closest thing that you get to say the
Microsoft conference sort of the
certainty conference
but it's not really for a specific
product per se but it does focus
entirely on PC gaming
they don't take they what's the words
they make sure that you know it's for PC
and you know maybe thank you also for
you specifically since you didn't nobody
builds exist there's like two ends of
things look at like companies like Dell
HP etc all have gaming PC lines all have
these great things and then the other
end and you can see a lot of these say
the AMD booth here at PAX East there's
also what we call system integrators and
these are guys who like AMD for example
we provide you know all of our bikes the
stuff that you would buy on the shelf
like our rice and processors and the
graphics cards and whatnot did they go
to these system integrators and they use
those parts to build you know custom
gaming pcs basically that you have
options to and you can look at those
that you can basically order a built
custom PC like as if you built it
yourself so that opportunity exists
thank you thank you
sorry just going oh I'm so tired right
now sorry oh this question strictly to
Steve from gamers Nexus by chance DC
will look from latest tech tips you saw
yes here they flip like flow plane yeah
whatever we have it's a brag or tiny be
overclock there may be a hashtag LTT to
stream
maybe we spoke with some of the people
down on the floor from water cool and
from alpha cool and anyone who makes
things involving the word cool they're
making sure that there will be a hashtag
repeal TT to I don't know if they can
respond to us though but that doesn't
mean I can't just respond twice thank
you very much thanks this is just a
question for George Howell you're able
to see through those glasses there's
kind of like Phoenician blinds so I can
just see you right through them I see
you perfectly so but it's very
beneficial when I'm at like busy
meetings I'm kind of getting bored and
falling asleep they can't tell thank you
actually these are made by Mesa tech who
is actually redditor so yeah that's a
tough one we do a lot of fun videos from
time to time
well just because she's telling me not
to I have to say it now I taught my wife
how to build a computer while I was
drunk
that was as much fun for me as it was
miserable for her and I always have fond
memories creating that partial memories
thank you hello
okay it's questions for Kevin hi by the
way
long time no see college together yes
last time I saw Kevin he was doing Wayne
parties for the GS at RIT we both went
there Kevin I have a question for you
though I had this shower thought at one
point kind of a horrifying realization I
was in I was I was working on my
computer one day and I was looking at
the news articles about you know the
steam steam box and gapes attempt with
gabe newell's attempt of that and I was
thinking myself oh my god except
sometimes seen people on PCMR or other
places get flack because oh you're a Mac
user or your analytics user oh my god
are we all choose from Microsoft because
we think about Windows dominates
everything and I'm sicker than myself
like are we all just perpetuating the
Microsoft monopoly and then Gabe comes
along in a row like oh let's switch the
steam theater box and get another one
commentary I think when it comes to PC
gaming I think it waits for those of us
who are into it for gaming where shills
for the games
right now we're shells for the games you
love and obviously those games are
supported on platforms that they you
know choose to support them on so a lot
of those tend to be Windows or the
council platforms which why there's that
contention between there and PC gaming
and whatnot but otherwise you know as I
think Pedro was talked about it's all
about you know what we're into yeah
I mean like for example I'm in ticketing
paycheck so I feel free and be speaking
of which when are you banning Bitcoin
miners from buying your products there's
the real question
we all knew that question was coming at
some point so so why is a blue alien
we're so disliked in the PC community
just it's because this is over prices
are like more alien we're just I think
earlier on before they had a lot of
competition from like cyber power high
power
borage and all the other sis they were
kind of out there on their own for
gaming and so they were able to charge a
premium and they didn't have a lot of
competition and that's how capitalism
works I think that has that reputation
has followed them and it's sort of the
assumption that anything we're over
charges at this point and sadly I think
that reputation also has spilled over to
other sis talking about people's earlier
some of the pre builds if you don't want
to build your own system they're really
only like 100 200 dollars more than if
you part it out yourself
which is not bad to hire someone to
build the computer for you alien where
remains very expensive but they attach
that price to their brand ID and that's
how they value their brand and they want
to be perceived as the best and
oftentimes consumers perceived the most
expensive as the best yeah cuz I like a
Alienware and I told my friends and they
were like bashing on me for that we had
like cyber power completely valid on any
of them
they're all I mean at the end of the day
it's all parts made by either this guy
or his competitors so how much hand do
they really have in it thank you
can I get those in prescription
[Laughter]
when I start to lose my vision on what
you know on a serious note I see a lot
of warning signs in terms of stuff
getting locked down I got into the PC
because you had a lot of freedom
you could overclock get different
components do what you wanted you could
break stuff it happened but things have
gotten more control you get voltage
limits that you can't really go over in
the graphics card it's the 1070 TI none
of them overclocked out of the factory
private servers for video games have
started to disappear do you think that's
just the way things are gonna have to go
now or are these warning signs that
we're gonna see more things get locked
down in the future or do you think that
things will bounce back
Steve you you're very technical do you
have any I think well there's one thing
we were talking about a while ago I fix
it as a campaign they run about I think
it's right to repair so just on the
physical hardware side at a government
level which is way above anything we can
do here at a government level there's
discussion of locking down taking things
apart and violating warranties and stuff
like that there's some debate whether
MSI or any of the other brands can stick
a stick around a box that says warranty
void of removed particularly if you have
to remove the thing to do something like
replace a battery so yes there is a very
large concern that things are getting
more lockdown for me on a hardware level
impacts my audience and my ability to do
business on that side you know stay
involved and look up right through
repair laws and if they apply in your
state and what you can do about it
because you do want that right to open
your hardware and then on the software
side Microsoft controls everything so
good luck thank you so we have about
five minutes left so I'd love to get all
your questions in so if we can power
through these these answers and these
questions and we can get them all in
so hello tom some glasses by the way two
comments one question a bachelor's
degree NIT I know your pain I'm sorry
nice glasses which comes to my third
question does RGB matter yeah that's
another controversial question you know
what color you have to it can make your
coffee your PC go faster the honest
answer to that though is does fancy
shoes matter does makeup or you know
nice clothes or music matter it's a
matter of personal taste and preference
follow what you like and follow what you
love with all marketing I've done for
RGB which I'm wearing it to my head into
my toes you can't see my feet but I'm
wearing RGB shoes and the even though
that's the case that's for me and I
don't think that's necessarily going to
be for everybody that's why we have
options if you don't want RGB fine get
it and set all the lights to white
that's fine or whatever it is you want
so yeah it's all about choice
we still make components without RGB
because we know it's not for everybody
and that's fine that's what my pager
said that's what PC gaming is all about
is that idea of choice and we want to
give as many choice as possible and when
your glasses come in RGB please tell me
because I want to buy them yeah
really cold all right thank you
quick question for Steve do you get a
lot of pressure from people who give
hardware to you to do positive reviews
and what sort of the blowback that you
get if you if you give a really nasty
review of something referencing the
recent Coolermaster video we're just
sort of case disintegrates and that's
terrible air flow what was sort of the
reaction to that well we we bought the H
500 P mesh so I think that answers
yeah it's fine we begin in effort of T
finish or I just answered a really
similar question in our ask GN not to
self-promote but there's like a 10
minute answer there okay and the short
of it is there is I don't know if it's
pressure to give a positive review but
there's a wink-wink nudge-nudge
you know what's gonna happen if you have
an excessively negative review and as
long as I see that's fair I don't really
care I mean I bought a Titan B I can buy
a computer case last question what's you
guys opinion this very buddy on the
g-force participation program and how
they're kind of turning the screws on
the industry in terms of their gaming
friends when is AMD gonna come out
poor Kevin now get to low down there
Wednesday is gonna come out with a
graphics card that can talk like a volt
or even a 1080 TI we gave our whole
timeline at CES that's all I can say
yeah as far as I know like nothing's
been 100% confirmed about GPP but if
that were the case I don't think it
would be ideal for for the manufacturers
as well as a consumer because you know
like branding is important I think if
you're trying to sell units you know
people who don't really know computer
hardware or who are just getting into it
they're gonna go for what they think is
the best based on brand sometimes you
know if they don't know to look up
benchmarks or go to Steve's channel
first they're gonna look at the box that
says gaming and has like the cool dragon
on it as opposed to the one that looks
really plain and simple it probably
doesn't do as much it won't excite you
as much and if GPP is really all that
it's touted to be then you know that
could that could really hurt everyone
involved I think and it just it just
limits it just list your options and it
seems a bit deceiving to me
there's we're still talking to people
about GTV if this is something that
takes a long time to look into the
original story from Kyle from Hart OCP
he talked himself about how it took a
couple of weeks to get all the answers
and that was dropped on obviously all of
us at the same time as you so it's taken
me weeks to get answers as well and now
that the story is out there it's also
difficult to distinguish which answers
I'm getting are genuine and which ones
have been impacted by even political
dealings in the industry or by the
original story because a lot of people I
talk to I'll get phrases that are
exactly from Kyle's article at that
point I don't know if they're just
trying to act like they know something
or if they actually do and it is exactly
what he said so it gets really tricky to
navigate that and without anything
concrete either way from the first party
it's hard for me to to break the story
further we're trying to though I'd agree
with the pile in that as it's been
presented if the presentation limit is
accurate then there is a problem and and
we just need to figure out if it has
been presented accurately well thank you
so this is PCM ours seventh birthday
that we were celebrating and we were in
fact supposed to have cake delivered
here but there was a problem with the
delivery I think they may be because of
the snow oh it is here oh well we'll
have to just celebrate afterwards after
party so the cake was in fact alive for
this presentation but thank you guys so
much for coming out and thank you to you
