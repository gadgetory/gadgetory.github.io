10x Xbox one X is what we're working on
today and we have thermal power and
gaming benchmarks for this so this is
new for us we've done thermal and power
stuff before with consoles with the
switch but now we have software to do
FPS benchmarks of games that we've
developed internally thanks to Patrick
Lathan who works on the team so pretty
cool stuff we have destiny 2 call of
duty World War 2 and then Assassin's
Creed origins for benchmarks this will
allow us to see what an Rx for 80-ish
class type of hardware can handle in a
console in terms of frame throughput and
frame Layton sees before that this video
is brought to you by thermal Grizzly
makers of the conductor hot liquid metal
that we recently used to drop 20 degrees
off of our coffee leak temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds for use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydro not pastes
learn more at the link below for the
testing set up long story short for
thermals we have a thermocouple mounted
to the back of the APU just on the back
side of the PCB this happens with CPU
testing too or you can mount a
thermocouple in the socket for the CPU
it's something you can do on a lot of
the AC sports for example we've taken
that idea and applied it's a console
mounting the thermocouple on the
opposite side of the apu so there will
be a delta between the PCB but it's not
gonna be that big of a delta we can
pretty much change the temperature as 40
case so we measured with another
thermocouple on the top of the GPU and
we're able to determine that it has a
shutdown temperature of about 85 degrees
celsius for case temperature or external
silicon temperature so that gives us a
range of what we know we're working with
there's a jaguar apu and that uses a an
integrated graphics solution on the apu
that has four TCU's operating at eleven
seventy two megahertz with more or less
polaris architecture at this point so
that's what we're looking at for the
hardware that means it's got more to use
than an RX 480 or 580 but a slightly
slower clock 100
sixty-eight ish megahertz slower than a
gaming X for example 580 for a game
benchmarking we are using three games
shown here and those games will give us
our first ever look at GM's new console
game benchmarking methodology we're
pretty excited about this but haven't
fully fleshed out the software yet so
this is a very first look that means the
video presentation and the testing will
definitely change in the future for now
what we're doing is we are live and
losslessly capturing frame rate the same
way we do with a VR benchmarking which
we introduced early this year and
capturing it live then we feed that
video file into our software and the
video file is able to determine the
dropped frames versus the delivered new
frames which it basically does at a very
high level by doing per pixel analysis
of what's changed in the frame and what
hasn't and then we determined from there
whether or not the frame was actually
new or as a repeat frame repeat frames
happen on consoles because of vsync the
games are basically all vsync and that
means that vsync is your policy for when
the bits flip in the pipeline so you
have something like a front buffer and a
back buffer for example in the GPU and
the front buffer is your current frame
that's being drawn the back buffer is
the next frame that's coming up to be
drawn and at some point in the process
the GP receives a to say okay flip these
buffers let's start drawing the back
buffer consoles are V synced so or at
least the games are pretty much always
be synced so you don't really see
tearing and what you can see is
stuttering stuttering would occur from
the the GPU missing the interval for
refresh with the vsync cycle so if
you're on sixty Hertz that's gonna be a
sixteen point six six seven millisecond
window if the GPU can't get a frame
ready in sixteen point six six seven
milliseconds then it will replay the
previous frame in VR there's there are
also drop frames and reproductions and
like that we've talked about that before
with traditional games it just repeats
the frame so if it happens a lot it
looks like a stutter so that's the very
basics of it we might go into more
detail at some point but the stutter
shouldn't really happen too much with
consoles but they do occasionally happen
and ultimately the developers are all
building for a single type of hardware
so they should be pretty optimized more
than PCs can be anyway so a last item is
power monitoring we're using a plug load
meter that we use for other GPU and CPU
testing that we've talked about in the
past this allows us to monitor second a
second or actually down two milliseconds
power consumption and then we can align
that with thermals and frame times to
determine the overall behavior of the
console under different loads so let's
start with assassin's creed because it
has the most the most animated charts I
suppose the other ones are pretty flat
lines assassin's creed though following
Ubisoft's policy is is a bit more
sporadic with its optimization starting
with assassin's creed origins and a
standard G on charts we'll get to the
new ones in a minute we quickly learn
that the game is rendering at 30 fps
despite the consoles claim to being the
most powerful console on the market 30
FPS would be a frame time of thirty
three point three three milliseconds and
we somewhat regularly dip to sixty six
point six seven milliseconds so that's a
drop from 30 fps to about 15 that means
if you drop one frame you now are
basically out of 15 fps the question is
whether it's sustained for a long period
of time this is reflected in our 1% and
0.1% lowest frame rate values against
the two-minute test window averaging out
to 27 FPS again average with 15 FPS for
1% lows and 0.1% lows our our next
measurements are presented as over time
charts will highlight which is which
before diving in we have thermal
benchmarks which are using a
thermocouple mounted to the back of side
of the apu frame time benchmarks using
our new software and then power
benchmarks using a login plug load meter
also note that our on-screen display has
a marker for the present second which
will highlight and then there are
markers for what's coming up in the next
few seconds and what has already had
and this historical graph will allow you
to look at what's coming up then focus
on the gameplay footage in the
background for any potential hiccups and
stutters and then look back at the graph
with this on-screen display you'll see
that our frame times are being plotted
as bouncing between 33 and 66
milliseconds or 30 and 15 FPS depending
on the load to be fair to Assassin's
Creed origins the game does not
regularly drop to 15 fps it seems to
primarily do so during combat scenes the
game maintains a flat 30 FPS during city
or on during exploration or other
non-combat scenarios
you'll see the thermals of power
consumption and framerate plummet
whenever we die and that's because we've
hit a black loading screen so nothing's
being rendered this is expected behavior
the Xbox one X maintains what is it
roughly a study state 62 degrees Celsius
apu backside temperature and that's
under gaming workloads with our thermal
paste improvement so we don't actually
know what it would be with the stock
pasted unfortunately and this puts the
front sight silicon temperature probably
closer to 70 to 75 degrees Celsius we
found that TK smacks is about 85 degrees
C before a thermal shutdown event occurs
we were not able to get the Xbox to ever
thermally shut down without
intentionally doing so there's no
thermal throttling going on here and no
temperature spikes aligned with
framerate drops so it's just combat
creating work for the APU power
consumption is around 170 watts with a
peak load of 181 watts and just to jump
back to frame x for a second
let's tab manually through one of these
sequences that drop some frames we
should be skipping every other frame
because the game renders at 30fps and is
captured at 60 every now and then we'll
get to skipped frames and that's when we
get there's latency spikes 266
milliseconds this can be seen commonly
in combat there are a few examples of
this during gameplay sequences as well
but they aren't too common they are
however common enough to Teeter on
noticeable even to console players but
for the most part they're not noticeable
using some pixel counting we were able
to determine that our capture of
assassin's creed origins just for the
sort of brief single frame that we
pulled aside to look at was rendering at
1080p however we haven't yet tested
we haven't really put emphasis on trying
to make things work with 4k haven't
tested 4k specific titles versus 1080p
variants yet so there's a lot more to do
here and the dynamic resolution could
become something to pay more attention
to as we continue to iterate on our
benchmarks because a major concern with
consoles versus PCs especially is if the
console claims it can handle 4k as a
maximum native output then what else is
it doing in the background to achieve
that because if you try to compare the
two devices it's entirely possible that
the frame quality on a console will be
lower for some frames then on for
example a PC and that's because the
console is very likely implementing some
sort of dynamic resolution policy to
sustain its target frame rate of 30 in
this instance so we did see 1080p for
the single frame we tested but we're
gonna have to look into that more in the
future so stay tuned for that as we're
now Assassin's Creed origins runs okay
but it is the worst of the three titles
that we've tested in terms of frame
latency and frame time consistency it
drops the most frames not super
noticeable when you play it back unless
you load it into software and tab
through the frames one at a time so that
means it's pretty much a non-issue
however this game does drop frames in
combat and if you have a lot of combat
especially with a lot of enemies it's
possible that you're gonna notice
occasional stutters during gameplay for
perspective let's look at what a
perfectly flat framerate looks like on a
console called DS campaign in-game
cinematics managed to render a perfectly
flat sixteen point six six seven
millisecond frame latency which means
we're running at a constant 60fps for
the campaign
as for thermals we do they're between 60
and 61 degrees Celsius which means we've
reached steady state and it's not really
changing at this point
power consumption jumps around between
at 157 watts and 181 watts with the
average around 173 watts of power here's
a multiplayer scene from call of duty
moving on from campaign this is also
rendering at 60fps flat and thermals
plot around the same again 60 to 62
degrees Celsius peak power is also
similar to the previous run the
occasional spikes in frame latency or
dips and performance aligned with the
killcam for this game we experienced one
to two dropped frames when transitioning
from the killcam to spawning and that's
not noticeable during regular play it
only becomes apparent again when tabbing
through the frames as you can see it's
right before they kill cab that we get
one of those repeated frames which means
that the vsync window was missed and so
the previous frame was rear-ended
fortunately it's not game critical at
this point in the respawn period so
you're not missing anything call duty
seems to maintain a 60 FPS steady output
in this configuration we tested three
scenes for destiny two but only two will
make it into this video the others being
saved for a future one the first is our
multiplayer scene this is the first
point at which other players can
accompany you in the game and it was one
of the bigger battles early on it's also
the only scene where we plotted both
frame time and framerate drops or spikes
with a frame times ranging from 16
milliseconds to 66 milliseconds the
average was 33 point 3 4 30 fps in
destiny - so it's a 30 FPS game on the
Xbox one axe we got 4 frames repeating
of 6300 so that's 0.06 percent of all
frames dropped and that's totally
insignificant and not noticeable during
gameplay it is 30 FPS though and that's
pretty noticeable as a PC player a few
frames also render as fast as sixteen
point seven milliseconds oddly it's
pretty uncommon but it does happen and
that's an effect of 60 FPS when it
happens the three frames that it does we
can tab through a few examples of
repeated frames here again they're not
common and it basically requires manual
scrubbing of footage to visually notice
them still the Xbox one X does not
always offer enough power to render
every single frame and hit the vsync
target thermals and power are largely
where they were in the previous games
looking at our next scene the market we
never encounter any frame latency spikes
is a constant 33 milliseconds for the
entire playthrough giving us an
unimpressive 30fps constantly the market
was also the most intensive scene we
encountered when benchmarking GPUs on PC
but the Xbox one X is able to hand on
through this scene let's now look at
power and thermals from an idle state
and then ramp into
burnin there's no capture footage for
this one with the console powered off
and in an effective sleep state the
device polls between zero and two watts
from the wall at all times it also
maintains pretty much a constant at
least 40 degrees Celsius temperature
versus about a 26 ambient as we wrap
into Assassin's Creed origins workloads
we see the initial power on spike at 110
watts
then about 60 watts of draw during the
menu and then it steps all the way up to
170 to 180 watts during the game
thermals during this time are plotted as
ramping from 40 C immediately upon power
on which then slowly ramps to 62 degrees
Celsius to the backside ap temperature
and one more note here I think we
configured our console to the instant on
mode and in that mode for the last
thermal test we did where it wraps from
40 to 60 something that was done by
unplugging the console letting it cool
down and then doing the test if we leave
the console plugged in it maintains
pretty much a constant 50 degree 55
degrees Celsius temperature on the
backside of the apu plugged in but
turned off so keep that in mind it runs
fairly warm when it's just off
apparently another note here the console
does spit a lot of heat out the back of
it so we showed in our tear down the
massive blower fan it's a glorified
reference card cooler it spits a ton of
heat out the back and if you have any if
you're planning to put this in a cabinet
or a shelf or anywhere that hasn't
enclosed back or against a wall then
consider moving it somewhere can breathe
because it's going to get really hot in
those configurations you want it and as
open and environment as possible console
gets warm and the thermal paste that's
on there stock is not very good so all
these numbers were with our improved
thermal paste application and that's
just something to keep in mind as well
the vrm is reasonably well cooled though
as is the vram but the AP is they wanted
to keep an eye out for so that's it for
the the first look at console
benchmarking from us we have a lot more
to do with this and
don't worry if you're here for PC stuff
it's not going away and there's not
gonna be a significant amount of this
forcing that out or anything like that
but for a new console launch like now
with this we're gonna do what we do with
games when they launch like destiny
we're gonna focus on a lot of content
pertaining to this for the short window
of time after launch and we have plenty
of other stuff like memory scale
abilities have seen on PC coming up in
the immediate future along with two or
three new case reviews and a couple of
other things so as always subscribe for
