softs watchdogs IP and now with the
second incarnation of the game here
we're starting our benchmarks with GPU
performance analysis across the entire
ten series from Nvidia and the AMD rx
series along with some older cards from
the last generation of hardware from
both vendors there are a lot of cards on
the bench and we spent a good amount of
time studying the graphics options to
better understand what it is that
watchdogs to finds the most stressful
for GPUs and hardware before getting to
that this coverage is brought to you by
AMD freesync displays like the LG 34 um
57 - P which is a $350 budget ultra wide
display at 2560 by 1080 learn more in
the link below
let's start with the watchdog's -
benchmark and we spent the first hour of
the game just looking around and
studying how the graphics settings and
the different elements within the game
impact performance this is looking for
things like meshes the complexity of
them and their impact on processing
ability for whatever card we happen to
be testing look at texture resolution
and the vram consumption of that texture
at least so far as we can tell and other
things like shadows and how they impact
gameplay which is actually pretty
heavily in this particular game there's
really complex foliage trees things like
that and they do interact with light in
a very intricate way with watchdogs -
this creates a pretty good
representation of how a world would
actually interact with the Sun but
obviously you've got a pretty big
performance trade-off depending on the
graphics setting so that's part of what
we looked at and the full methodology
for this benchmarking course is of
course defined in the article linked in
the description below so if you're
curious about how we tested it why we
tested a certain way what drivers we use
things like that it's all down there I
will make one quick note the drivers
used just because every time it's a
question and people don't seem to click
the article the drivers used are brand
new we have access to them normally
early the Nvidia cards we're test with
the latest Nvidia drivers the numbers in
the article and those do officially
support watchdogs - and the same is true
for AMD tested with the latest and these
drivers so that's all done as it should
be and the rest is defined below now
getting in
Thane's loosely starting graphics
settings include geometric detail or the
mesh complexity and number of primitives
drawn extra details which adds to mesh
detail and uses a percentage offset to
do so terrain and vegetation are both
next which also both impact LOD and view
distance on their respective elements so
for some specificity vegetation detail
directly correlates to draw distance of
those more complex trees that I was
talking about including individual
leaves and branches and how far away you
can see them shadows are a bit
interesting as well although we
primarily tested with core shadow
settings that would be low to ultra you
could also go beyond the presets and
configure them to use things like
percentage closed or soft shadows or
high fidelity frustum traced shadows
both of which are end video technologies
that we previously covered in depth and
you can learn more in our coverage of
those technologies the rest is pretty
self explanatory and has very an impact
on weather and fog effects both
plentiful in the game's recreation of
San Francisco and generally just a
couple of other small tweaks things like
anti aliasing which is a large tweak and
then your normal filtration settings as
always we conduct multiple test passes
per device so for some devices depending
on how many resolutions we test in
quality settings that could be dozens of
tests for one video card and that's to
ensure parity we're looking for
deviation we're looking for consistency
in the frame rate measurements not just
from an analytical perspective but from
a gameplay perspective can you actually
feel the difference one test run or one
day to the next when you're playing the
game and that's averaged as necessary
and we of course use our 1% end point
one percent low methodology which is
basically taking the slowest 1% and
point one percent of frames is all
defined in a video elsewhere and we look
at frame times when doing that but we
look at the slowest percentile metrics
and then use that to extrapolate the low
end performance rather than a minimum or
maximum which are both outliers and
should be ignored
neither hfts nor p CSS were used in the
larger benchmark charts though we did
take a quick look at them and that's
just really for some fairness between
brands and because they're kind of
unnecessary technologies and do have an
impact
on performance well looking at the game
with 1080p ultra very high and medium
for the 1920 by 1080 settings and then
we'll be looking at 1440p ultra and 4k
with very high settings the game was
tested in near Mission Park in San
Francisco where we mix in cars grass and
complex trees we carefully tested at
exactly the same time of day with the
same conditions which is a sunny day
that cast more shade from the foliage
and that more heavily impact performance
so yes it does actually matter quite a
lot what time of day you benchmark if
it's raining or not and what direction
the sun is shining depending on where
you're walking when interacting with
those shadows let's get to the first
chart this one's simple with this chart
we're showing it rough performance
scaling across settings by aggregating a
couple of our mid-range cards note that
this isn't a perfect representation of
how all cards will scale but it gives a
rough idea devices with less vram for
example will struggle disproportionately
toward the high end where these averaged
here might not a note also that max
settings the quote unquote max is tuned
with ultra and then further tuned with
extra details Max and the shadows set to
hfts
let's move on to some hard data here's
our 1080p ultra results EVGA is GT X
1080 FTW unsurprisingly leads the pack
operating this configuration at about 76
FPS average with lows consistently
around 60 fps the gtx 1070 a card around
roughly $400 is capable of juggling
1080p at Ultra settings and that's with
a 64 FPS throughput and closely
following lows no trouble at all for
this one and then AMD's r9 Theory X
pushes a frame rate comparable to the
970 SSC not benefitting noticeably from
its HBM that's not the first time we've
seen this performance out of the fury X
either or its stack up against cards
like the 970 SSC moving down to the
mid-range cards we're seeing MSI GTX
1060 gaming X operating at 45 FPS
average about 39 1% lows and about 37
0.1% lows that's fairly tightly times
across the board and remains reasonably
playable we'll look at how a settings
reduction supports the GTX 1060 in a
moment though for folks on the GTX 970
as shown here you'll be at roughly
performance to a GTX 960 at least the
ones we've tested and moving to MSI's
gaming X version of the rx 488 gigabyte
card the card is producing an average
FPS about 41 with low is at 32 and 28
respectively our gaps between averages
and lows are a bit larger than on the
GTX 1060 here though the visible
difference is not necessarily that
substantial at this point next the RX
474 gigabyte which is 35 that's 7 FPS
average with 0.1% low is also somewhat
distantly timed this card begins to
exhibit some stuttering during play and
that's a result of frame time disparity
and can be resolved largely by a
settings reduction speaking of these are
our very high charts and they're a
little simplified the high end devices
remain left to the ultra tests and at
the top of this particular chart we see
the GTX 1060 gaming X and 970 SSC both
at roughly 60 FPS average the our X 480
gaming X follows closely at 56 FPS
average effectively equal to the 970 SSE
and performance and largely
insignificant in its differences from
the gtx 1060 the new cards on this chart
include the gtx 1050 2 gigabyte and our
x4 62 gigabyte the 1050 non ti card is
pushing a 32 FPS average with sort of
rough lows really the RX 460 is in
similar shape they're worse off at 26
FPS average and 13 FB a 0.1% lows this
manifests itself noticeably in jarring
stutters just for quick reference we ran
the 1050 2 gigabyte in 462 gigabyte at
medium settings for a more realistic
look at performance and the result was
an output of about 50 FPS average for
the 1050 and about 4045 FPS average for
the rx 460 so a lot more playable if you
drop down to medium on those cards 1440p
ultra it's a bit taxing but we gave it a
shot anyway the GT X 1080 FTW pushes
about 55 FPS average with the lows
consistently north of 40 next the 1070
runs a 45 FPS average and remains fairly
playable with how watchdogs 2 is built
anyway the gtx 1060 fury X and 970 SSE
are all in the stuttered range of
gameplay and they would be better
matched to a 1440p resolution if using
settings closer to high
watchdogs intensive settings we only
tested three cards at 4k resolution
because we were pushing for a very high
quality the GTX 1080 FTW isn't quite 4k
ready at very high settings but could do
so with a slight settings reduction 1070
SC would also need to be dropped though
closer to a mix of high settings maybe a
bit of medium for FPS sustained in the
40s the fury X isn't much of a contender
here at all and stutters like mad with
those low frame rates but if you really
really wanted it I suppose you could
drop down the quality quite a bit I
would generally prefer a 1440p output
with a higher quality in this scenario
so watchdogs - it's a very intensive
game it's not really that easy on this
hardware even stuff like the 1080 FTW is
struggling at resolutions with quality
settings that in other games wouldn't
really make it struggle quite so much
and that's not necessarily an
optimization issue so much as it is just
what's being drawn in the game I mean
think about it if we walk by a park it's
drawing tons of grass and just from
looking at it it seems like most if not
all of those blades are individually
interacting with light with shadows you
walk under a tree with the Sun behind
you shining down over the character
shoulder and that's casting a ton of
really finely detailed shadows from an
already complex tree onto the character
and from a lighting standpoint it's
pretty cool graphics but it's not easy
for a GPU to handle so this is a game
where the FPS does not look quite as
impressive as some of the other games
we've tested recently however watchdogs
- just sort of subjectively speaking
here is one of the games that is fairly
agreeable to play in the 40s for FPS I
was really not complaining that much
when in the 40 45 FPS range obviously a
bit higher a bit better but it wasn't as
big a deal as say battlefield one where
you really want that high FPS for
competitive play that's not to say
watchdogs - can't be competitive but
certainly with the way the game is
designed the lower FPS is a little bit
more agreeable than in some of the
higher speed games so overall if you're
seeing FPS metrics sort of in the mid to
upper 40s that is
generally acceptable for the card that
you're seeing the numbers for however
you could always do a slight settings
reduction and in this game a good place
to look for you to start with settings
reductions would be things like shadows
because shadows have a huge impact on
performance and then next would probably
be things like foliage and vegetation
which again a lot of things to draw and
a lot of light interactions if your
shadow settings are set so that they are
interacting so that's where I'd look as
far as cards that can play watchdogs to
obviously like always most things can
play technically it's just a matter of
how low you're willing to go on the
settings so for my notes here I've got
that the 1080p very high settings and
1080p Ultra settings that look more or
less the same when you're actually in
the game playing it not actually sitting
there staring looking for differences
between them but when you're actually
playing and engaged they pretty much
look the same it's there's a couple
differences but it's not bad with that
said very highs a lot more playable than
ultra in terms of FPS the jaunt is
pretty massive here if very high is
acceptable for you and it probably
should be for most people
then the arcs for 70 and up are playable
on the AMD side the GTX 970 dot are
playable on the Nvidia side the GTX 1050
Ti is pretty close a couple settings
weeks would make it possible to play
with fluid frame rates and have good
gameplay that's acceptable and that's
with a reduction to the settings
obviously the GTX 1060 and our X 480
really have no problems at all with
1080p and very high settings Ultra is a
lot harder and that's really where
you're gonna need something like an Rx
480 or a GTX 1060 and even those we're
getting by and about the 40s but like I
said that's okay in this game for the
most part now as for the golden standard
60fps metric that's where you've got a
push for something like a 1070 SC or
there abouts and the currently current
generation doesn't have an equivalent to
that but with the advent of Vega that
will obviously hopefully eventually come
out but that's not here today so we
can't really tell
so for today the 10 70s he looks about
right for that settings output higher
resolutions are pretty rough anything
short of a 1080 will generally need to
operate at a settings reduction and even
the 1080 FTW we've got here we have to
drop the settings quite a bit for 4k to
be happy that was generally in the range
of high rather than very high or ultra
so that pretty much sums it up now I
know there's always questions of why
didn't you test X card or Y card we've
got limited time and we've got limited
hardware I know we've got a lot of video
cards but it's not necessarily the ones
that you always want us to test and then
there's obviously again limited time so
980 I unfortunately did not make it in
today I would like to test it and we
will probably test it in the future the
same goes to the 960 and the same goes
for some of the r9 series cards like the
380 X and the 290 X which I'd really
like to test but we have content pieces
