recap for the past week of news in the
industry we have information on coffee
lake Vega 11 colorful is crazy
motherboard that they have for mining
and a couple of new keyboard switches
along with information on Paul from
Paul's hardware before that this is
brought to you by the EVGA 240 c LC
which is a $120 MSRP closed-loop liquid
cooler the EVGA 240 c LC has an RGB
illuminated pomp plate uses a thermal
probe with in the lower pump chamber for
liquid temperature monitoring and allows
customization through software learn
more at the link in the description
below
the first news item for the week is that
Paul from Paul's hardware has been lying
to you all he's secretly a GPU miner and
it hurts me just as much to say it as it
hurts you to hear it but gamers Nexus
recently came to find out that yes Paul
from Paul's hardware does have very
serious GPU mining problems and Paul
after you attempted to call me out for
using the word gouge in your recent
podcast I really had no recourse but to
bring up this serious problem of yours
with GPU mining and you know the thing
is Paul and Kyle with that live stream
opened up with some questionable content
that probably violates twitch Terms of
Service and following that and obviously
a bout of embarrassment they decided to
change the topic to talk about my use of
the phrase price gouging which
apparently has a specific definition in
13 US states so as Paul points out the
phrase price gouging in these states is
only usable for things like food and gas
topics which Paul is no doubt very
familiar with
well here's ago Paul uploaded a video
entitled reclamation garage where
clogged for Paul I'm here to call you
out reclamation has a very specific
legal definition here in the US quoting
US legal calm the Congress of the United
States enacted public law 95-87 of
course you know of this one I'm sure the
law was known as the surface mining
control and reclamation act of 1977
known heretofore as reclamation law
reclamation law often involves financing
of abandoned mining sites and
establishing an abandoned mine land
reclamation fund to finance said
restoration of said land think about it
all of his garage wear clogs may seem
like an innocent way to make content on
a morning's notice but in reality
Paul is building the ultimate GPU mining
facility in his garage and he's using
government funds to finance that project
and the reclamation of the garage so
Paul I'm sorry it had to be this way the
people had to know your use of the legal
phrase reclamation doesn't fool anyone
here gotcha all right so I rest my case
on that if you want to see their episode
go to pause hardware or bit wit and
they've got their full live stream over
there two episodes one on each channel
it's worth watching just you know make
sure Paul knows about the reclamation
things so first real news item not that
Paul isn't a real news item vague 11
according to digit times and tech power
up it sounds like Andy is looking to
shift its packaging responsibilities off
of ASE and on to another facility so
this other one is called silicon where
precision industries or SPI L and SPI L
has already begun packaging Vega 10 GPUs
and they have reportedly through digit x
and other reports that techpowerup sites
reportedly have been tasked with vega
11g p is going forward and this is well
let's give an idea why this happened
first I suppose so ASE was partly
responsible for Andy's limited launch
quantities with Vega 10 GPUs which were
the 64 and 56 cards that came out Vega
10 is the actual GPU that's on there and
because of units getting stuck in
packaging and assembly not packaging
like this but packaging like getting the
HP on the interposer and the dye all on
to a single package with yield actually
being usable afterward that process
apparently wasn't going over so well
with ASE so it sounds like AMD is
splitting
or moving these these responsibilities
in part to SP il-4 vega 11 and
potentially vega 10 as well as for vega
11 and the specs we're not yet sure if
that will run gddr5 or HBM to vega 11
will definitely be a new GPU from vega
10 so that much is certain
and it's possible that Andy could have a
built-in gddr5 controller with vega 11
the lower and GPUs where they stick with
HP m2 on Vega 10 that's possible but we
just don't know yet the HBM set up on
their HPCC the protocol has the
capability as does the rest of the GPU
to use either gddr5 or HBM 2 but the
controller on vega 10 only is for HP m -
they don't have a gddr5 controller on
the Vega 64-56 and frontier edition card
so it's only possible for them for AMD
T's HBM - on those cards if they go with
the gddr5 controller on vega 11 then
maybe something will change there but we
just don't know right now so either way
vega 11 has the opportunity to pick
between them to pen a knife and the
designed gddr5 memory controller for 11
what the power parameters might be
things like that we'll talk about that
more when the time comes but for now the
egg 11 is slated to replace Polaris so
the 500 and 400 lines which have seen
shortages throughout most of the year
should be replaced by Vega 11 at some
point in the semi near future for the
next news item coffee Lakes 1151 sockets
been making rounds as rocks recent Z 370
motherboard and other document leaks
have shown that the new coffee like
motherboards will use socket LGA 1151
just like the existing at z2 70
motherboards it's a little bit upsetting
that the coffee lake CPUs won't be
backwards compatible with LGA 1151
boards from z2 70s line from what we
know now it looks like a Z 370 and Z 270
won't have significant chip set
differences and they're gonna have the
same socket it's very pretty much the
same architecture that's not to say
coffee lake
is on exciting as a CPU going to six
cores is pretty interesting but does it
need to exist on a new motherboard if
it's got the same socket very similar if
not the same chipset and same TDP same
pretty much everything what what's the
impetus there for having a new
motherboard requirement that's what I am
interested in so that's pretty
frustrating but also something that
Intel's done in the past this is not new
for Intel to force a motherboard change
with a CPU release in recent years
they've done a little bit better with
having inter compatible boards and CPUs
hopefully there's some unofficial
support of that here but to move away
from it in an official stance is
definitely disappointing so a little
disappointed in Intel for that but as
tom's hardware points out the leaked
asrock page did differ a bit from
previous leaks that have been around for
coffee like specifications but not in
significant ways in terms of the specs
everyone's been talking about so that
leaks the differences in the leaks from
what Tom's Hardware noted on the asrock
page were that the core counts lineup as
the i5 still being six core six threads
that's the same i7 is still six core
twelve thread i3 is still four core four
thread but the i3 8350 k's TDP is listed
as 91 watchon as rocks page where
previously was in the 60 watt range and
then the cache is also listed as nine
megabytes for the 80 600 k and eight
megabytes for the 83 50 k which is a bit
higher than the previous leaks or
rumours as well but not too much so
that's the only real change their
colorful is that latest motherboard is a
quote professional mining motherboard
which eliminates reliance on riser cards
by instead creating a board that's
nearly 2 feet long at 485 by 195
millimeters the board hosts 7 PCIe x16
16 slot using an additional 16 PCIe
power cables along the board alongside
one EPS 4 pin this bypass is a 24-pin
connector which could potentially cause
issues in some configurations or with
some power supplies depending on how
they're doing signaling the motherboard
also takes live
with memory here so colorful is using a
sodium module rather than a full-length
dim and IO is limited to two USB 2.0 one
HDMI and one rj45 and there's also a
single SATA 3 port present so aside from
looking kind of comical not really sure
how useful that is even to the serious
miners a lot of the pictures I've seen
generally look like they've just got a
bunch of riser cards hanging off of
boards and then you have people like
either a sister asrock recently with
that board that had in the teens of a
very short PCIe connectors on their
motherboard with just a bunch of risers
sticking out of them so that was the
spill a different market I don't know
but it's another interesting colorful
creation so the very least of getting
media coverage of it in the West can
we've seen a lot of that in the past
week next news item here Jones bow and
there TW closed-loop liquid coolers so
Jones bow for those who don't know Jones
bow is a supplier in the case industry
and a design company they supplied the
Roseville Cullinan case and the an ADIZ
a I crystal that's the same case it's
made by Jones Bowl ultimately and they
provide a lot of the other cases in the
market as well they've provided several
of the mini ITX cases in the past
specifically two rows well like they're
like a CW one series that was a Jones
bow design and recently woke up and
stuck tempered glass on everything so
you're seeing a lot more of them now
even if they're just rebrand ultimately
so this company is now getting into
closed-loop liquid coolers and they're
doing that with a TW series starting
with TW 120 and 240 CL CS and the focus
is largely on design here so Jones was
using a hexagon shaped pump block with
hexagon stamps in the fan housing so
it's stamped out with hexagons
everywhere and RGB LEDs everywhere or at
least LEDs everywhere apparently
supports synchronization with ACS and
MSI motherboard software and
the ID matches between the fan and the
pump so kind of different definitely got
more of an industrial look to it or
something but that's new from Jonesboro
this week the next news item is kales
new mini choc PG 1 2 3 2 switches which
minimize switch height for mechanical
keyboards these PG 1 2 3 2 switches that
use a smaller form factor than what
we're used to with the Cherry MX clones
or the Cherry MX which is the pre travel
is about one point two millimeters plus
or minus 0.5 millimeters apparently an
actuation is two point four millimeters
this should feel similar to the MX blues
in terms of actuation force required its
clicky only for now and the company is
looking into alternatives if there's
interest but other than that it's
basically a smaller version of what
already exists in case you wanted a an
ultra small form-factor mechanical
switch and then finally this is some
website news so we finally switched over
to SSL so the website should be fully
HTTPS now rather than HTTP if you want
to check it out you can go to gamers
Nexus dotnet I don't think anything's
broken specifically because of the
switch tasks SL there are things that
are broken I don't think that's will hi
if you see any page loading errors or
other redirect issues that pertain
specifically to SSL tweet at us at
cameras Nexus let me know and we'll get
those resolved but lots of stuff going
on for the website the first one was
moving the SSL then we've got some other
updates back-end performance wise things
like that and eventually some front end
changes so that's all for this time at
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus if you'd
like to help us out directly subscribe
for more I'll leave a quick note here
for the next ten days or so I'm going to
be producing a lot of the videos on my
own andrew is heading out for a little
bit so we're gonna be shooting in this
setup because it's already all set up
like this and I apologize if the editing
is not quite up to what you're used to
but I'll do my best so thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time
we've information on a few things Coffee
