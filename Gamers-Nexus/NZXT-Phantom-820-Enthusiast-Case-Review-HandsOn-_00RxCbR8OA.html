Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
NZXT is high-end behemoth gaming case
the phantom 820 this is considered an
enthusiast great case and is equipped
with a mountain of features including
plenty of cooling and cable management
options as such it is unwieldy and quite
heavy and there's no way to put this
lightly 250 bucks so the case builds
upon a lot of high-end elements that
will continue to pave the way for future
case design in my opinion whether or not
it is in your price range
I would highly recommend learning more
about this case so you can see where the
industry is headed now as for the
features due to the sheer amount of
features that it ships with where we're
going to change out the format of it and
look first at the offerings of the case
and then delve into my experiences
building the system and its performance
in our lab and thoughts on whether it's
worthwhile and all that the first thing
you'll notice is that it's a monster
case it measures nine point two inches
wide twenty five point six inches tall
and twenty four point one inches deep so
it's gargantuan better yet it weighs in
at 32 pounds pre-build and is quite a
bit heavier once you've stocked it with
all of your GPUs and heat sinks and
what-have-you as for basic specs the
case ships with a top mounted 200
millimeter fan front 200 millimeter fan
side 140 millimeter fan and rear 140
millimeter fan the case is
pre-configured to have front and side
intake with rear and top exhaust so it's
a standard push-pull configuration and
as for additional fans there's room for
five more fans depending on how large
you go for instance you could opt for
either two 200 millimeter fans or three
120 millimeter fans on the top depending
on what you're going for and there's all
kinds of radiator room in there as well
you can fit a total of a 280 or three
sixty millimeter radiator for the top
and 240 or 280 millimeter radiator for
the bottom and there's 90 millimeters of
internal top space for that top radiator
so that's quite a bit of liquid cooling
that you can do past the fans we see
that there are 10 I think I counted that
right 10 grommeted cable routing holes
for cable management and that's
basically one hole for cable it's it's
almost like someone got a little too
happy with the hole punch
because there's almost nowhere in the
sidewall that kit that you can't route a
cable this is a good thing
they've also scattered cable tie anchors
throughout the case so you can easily
bundle cable clusters and anchor them to
something so it's not just floating
around in space the case can host EA TX
XL ATX ATX micro ATX and if you don't
want to look like you're
overcompensating for anything you could
even put a mini ITX motherboard in there
so I almost want to build an APU enabled
mini ITX system just if only for laughs
but moving from that we have the
mounting rails for the drives which are
all completely tool lists for both
internal and external drive bays and the
bottom drive bay Kage is completely
removable from the case if you end up
not needing it the case is primarily
composed of steel and plastic and for
the most part feels like relatively
solid construction I do have a few
complaints about build quality but we'll
get to those in a moment with the rest
of my opinions and one of the more fun
elements of the phantom 820 that I want
to mention is its hue LED controller
which is a light version a li te version
of NZXT LED lighting system and it
allows for full control of a few
pre-mounted LEDs on the front panel and
an LED strip on the interior of the case
spinning the dial allows on-the-fly
color changing for dozens of colors I
think I forget I counted somewhere
around 70 or more colors plus or minus
10 it's quite hard to count because they
were very very minor differences between
them which is good if you want a lot of
color options one thing I noticed that
is that the color seemed quite vibrant
for LEDs contrary to a lot of more dull
options out there you notice a lot of
cases with red LEDs for example or a
little less vibrant than other
wavelengths
when I asked NZXT about why there seems
so vibrant they confirmed that their
controllers unique hardware allows for
better LED control and maximizes
intensity across the spectrum better in
that same grain there's a rear i/o light
panel that makes cable swapping a bit
less swearing intensive when it's dark
and the front panel of the case has four
USB to ports two USB 3 ports standard
analog audio ports a fan controller
power state buttons and an SD card slot
which will unfortunately not allow the
front lid to close when an SD card is
mounted but that's just a design flaw
for the larger SD cards like mine the
fan controller is four channels and
offers a wide range of speeds including
full off and full blast there are also
several in-between speeds that offer
greater cooling at relatively low noise
levels and that's a lot of features so
I'm sure I'm forgetting something here
but I think you get the gist of this
case it's basically everything all the
things are included so they even
actually pre manage the front panel
cables and include an EPS v 12 or 12 V's
excuse me extender for your PSU so if
your cable is too short because it is
quite a large case then you can just
plug it into a really nice cable
extender from there premium cables kit
so there's that lots of pampering on
that end the build itself let's let's
talk about this so I'll first say that
this was one of the easiest most
satisfying builds I've ever actually
completed it was fast and mostly
painless and looked incredibly clean at
the end of it it was it was very easy to
cable manage everything incredibly easy
the cable management is thorough and
straightforward and the performance
numbers have been solid in our testing
you can find our full benchmarks in the
full review that's linked in the
description below if you'd like to see
the performance against other cases as
for construction quality things are
generally solid the exception here is
the poor ish quality of the external
drive mounting clips I found they were a
bit flimsy as were the hard drive cages
mounting an optical drive in this case
would be quicker with a simple thumb
screw than the plastic key brackets that
are featured internally and they were
they were loose and they were
challenging to align properly I actually
had the drive become loose several times
during the build because I mount drives
first for cable management purposes the
issue was eventually resolved but took
far more frustration than necessary as
for drive bay cages or for hard drives
they felt intentionally lightweight
almost as if NZXT wanted to shed a few
ounces from the case and connecting
cables to the drive seems to push them
in an extra quarter inch too far which
meant I had to remount them after they
were cabled not a huge deal but
something to note the actual assembly
was
exceedingly easy despite these issues
and cable management is almost mindless
and there's enough room where you won't
be cutting your hands to ribbons while
screwing around with heat sinks so
there's a feature for you not bleeding
is a feature that is only available in
large cases evidently I'm not bitter on
a similarly good cable management note
the phantom 820 has a large amount of
space within its right side panel which
is bezel to allow even fatter cables and
can accommodate up to one point four
inches of cabling that's pretty
impressive and a massive plus to the
case we ran a lot of performance tests
on the case most of which are published
in the review but one thing I wanted to
note in this video is that the
additional fans had had kind of slightly
unexpected results so I want to
elaborate on those after adding an
additional 200 millimeter fan to the top
exhaust port I found that the
temperatures of the CPU actually
increased by 3 Celsius which was
substantial enough to be disconcerting
our airflow analysis seems to
demonstrate that the added exhaust fan
is interacting negatively with the CPU
cooler and creating a dead zone of air
where it's competing with the CPU fan
for air and that is partially due to the
- Niek tower 120 we have and it's it's
basically sucking air in from the front
of the case and the CPU cooler that is
it sucks air from the front and shoots
it toward the back however adding an
additional bottom mounted fan improved
the GPU temperatures by a massive 7
degrees Celsius and that is with a with
a standard Aero cool fan I forget the
RPM but it was around 1,100 rpm I think
so quite massive and very noticeable if
you're thinking of adding an extra fan
make it the 140 millimeter bottom fan
not the top fan as that was actually
detrimental to air flow I also ran tests
of the fan speed controller multiple
configurations and found the lowest
settings were often powerful enough to
keep things cool and running low
intensity games while maintaining a
relatively low decibel level and
disabling all the case fans was
surprisingly acceptable and I was able
to rely upon component cooling for
performing non intensive tasks now
overall to wrap things up I've been
pleased with the phantom 820 there
aren't a lot of competitors for
enthusiasts in this price range due to
the
the lower volume shipping so the
best-known alternative is probably
Corsairs 800 d which is priced slightly
higher and it has an entirely different
aesthetic so so that will vary your
mileage will vary based on what you're
looking for I truly believe that cases
like the Obsidian 800 d and phantom 820
and other high-end cases are really
paving the way for gaming enthusiasts
and as more enclosures hit the market in
this price range we'll hopefully see
competition drive down MSRP to a point
where they become a tiny bit more
mainstream not a whole lot though of
course like quite a lot of features so
it can't come down that far I feel like
the 250 price point for the Phantom is
fair but I don't think it's necessarily
worth it for most gamers if it ever
drops to 200 though I would expect to
see it flying off the shelves because it
is quite a good case it's just that that
250 is mentally a lot harder to swallow
than $199 for example it's a fantastic
enclosure excuse me Wow with a few small
mechanical issues as for my verdict if
you can't quite afford the Phantom 820
but you like what you see consider the
third version - Corsair 650d 1/2 X or
fractal are in the lower mid-range if
you want to spend less than 100 bucks
rows wells are 5 and Corsairs 200 are
are still some of the best options we've
worked with and enthusiasts of course
have little reason not to pick up a
phantom 820 and once it drops a couple
of bucks I think it should be on
everyone's radar in the least that's it
for this time leave a comment on our
review if you have any questions at all
and I'll see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
