today at least in the US for the college
system we were at the new you cie sports
arena in Southern California UCI is the
first top 200 school actually public
school I should say to support an
eSports program which what we're looking
at here the reason we're covering it is
because it is brought to you by some of
the people we work with in the hardware
world that would include high power and
of course si logitech's involved berta
gear for the chairs a couple other folks
but a lot of Thai can i buy power
probably the two largest names you
recognize in terms of the hardware here
supported by those two companies for UCI
in there e sports arena which I'll
describe momentarily there are sixty
systems presently today and half of
those are revolt tues which we reviewed
previously that's the MIT xbox with
liquid cooling forced on the cpu because
of its small form factor nature and then
the other systems are Noctis 450s the
n450 from NZXT when I by powers biggest
partners so there's the main system
setups all them are the same spec
they're all 67 100 k SQ CPUs so I 767
hundred k's i do not know if they're
overclocked probably not another they
also all have gtx 1080 founders decision
cards so basically top-of-the-line
system for the UCI a sports arena now in
terms of what this is doing for the
world of eSports at least in the US if
not more is they are bringing the sort
of semi traditional approach to a
college sports program to the eSports
world I hesitate to make that comparison
but I do it because there are
scholarships for eSports players now
through UCI and they're currently there
are 10 players who are competing five
have received a scholarship five more
will receive a scholarship very soon and
each player gets a 5,600 dollar boon
basically to their education so they
come to the school they get their 5,600
bucks and that is granted based on merit
so this isn't an academic grant based on
your school performance things like that
it's actually granted based on your
performance in the games the main game
here League of Legends is the top one
that's being used right now CS is being
represented in the arena as well and
there are some teams here today
including some of the teams that you'll
recognize and talk about the
more but immortals is one of them by the
way so other than that the future it
looks like there might be support for
overwatch through the scholarship and
through the eSports program and smash
may also get support not a game we
talked about a lot on the site but that
is one of the ones that might be in the
plans for the future here at the UCI EA
sports arena so that's the main
information that you need to know the
look at this from a grander scale
outside of UCI is that there are nine
other schools that currently support
some form of eSports program and the
players who come in here through the
scholarship will be competing against
those players from the other nine
schools just like you'd see in a
traditional competitive program through
a school that's what we're looking at so
the system's got all the specs got all
the information the Logitech setups 2g
for 10g 303 and g430 we've talked about
all those before as always more
information link to the description
below thank you for watching we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
