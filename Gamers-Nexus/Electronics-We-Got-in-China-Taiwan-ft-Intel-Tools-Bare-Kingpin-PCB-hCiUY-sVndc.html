Taiwan and China and we took some time
in visiting some of the manufacturers to
ask for things that they no longer
needed and that brought us some pretty
cool stuff like this
it's a keep-out gauge for motherboard
stuff that you don't normally see so we
go through some of the stuff that
vendors gave us and that we bought in
the Shenzhen s e-g the market in watchon
Bay where we picked up things like for
example this cooler for about $2 u.s. so
we're gonna go over all the stuff we got
in Asia today when we were there for two
weeks before that this video is brought
to you by EVGA SZ 390 dark motherboard
the Z 390 dark is a flagship motherboard
for intel's unlocked case q CPUs with
tuning done by overclocked engineering
team at kingpin and 10 to enable higher
memory and CPU frequencies the
motherboard uses a unique rotated socket
design to move EPS 12-volt cables to the
right side making cable management
easier and also sticks to two DIMM slots
to improve memory overclocking stability
and Headroom we previously analyzed the
BRM and full and found it among the best
in class 4 z 390 overclocking and it
also got rid of RGB LEDs
learn more at the link in the
description below before we get into the
specifics of what we bought we wanted to
show you a clip of where we bought it at
the Shenzhen electronics market the SE g
e market in watchon bay in shenzhen
china and walk through just just part of
the first floor of that market to
explain how massive the environment is
for electronics there so the first thing
we saw here is just a bunch of external
cases so like shells for batteries and I
think especially just I don't know just
all kinds of random external housing and
then there's PCBs here so I think they
actually do power supplies you get a
power supply made so I mean it says
right here ECU ICS so you get a printed
circuit board done I think they go to
someone else for the printed circuit
board I'm not sure
and next to this stall but unrelated is
just all of the RGB lots of RGB LEDs
we're still in the first floor right now
other than the LEDs there's like power
switches so you could come here and
build your own custom devices like put
together get a circuit board printed
there's 12 hours circuit board printing
services that we walk past so you can
buy small SMDs and from in thye the real
even so you can put them on like service
mount machines SMT lines buy them by the
reel get a custom circuit board printed
and then you come through here and buy
things like speakers or power switches
or all these various buttons LEDs
adapters cables and get it all made on
one floor for custom PCB design from
scratch
just all through the Shenzhen s e-g
market leading off of that topic then
for example if you had a kingpin PCB you
could buy all the parts needed to make a
kingpin card before he even comes out
with the real product and that'll lead
us to the first thing we wanted to talk
about that we got in Taiwan when we
visited EVGA s headquarters in Taipei so
let's start with this this is a 20 80 TI
kingpin board and this actually clearly
has no no SM DS on it yet it all doesn't
even have a GPU on it this is a
pre-production sample where 10 and
kingpin or Vince and Ilya they gave us
this as a I guess commemoration of their
product that's not yet out it'll be out
end of March I think but anyway it's
just kind of cool to see the bare PCB
like that we have other stuff like this
- I'll grab one of them so we have a
semi populated MSI 780ti Lightning where
the vrm is on there but no GPU dough
memory and none of the expensive stuff
and then we also have an msi from
previously x3 99 creation and this is
actually just a bare PCB that's so much
they came thin card we got so anyway
King band card looks really cool without
any stuff on it it's got the gold
plating on it theoretically better or
easier to access grounding and this is
something well
about more soon as the product actually
comes to launch and also while we were
visiting them know by the way build
Zords working on a vrm breakdown of this
car - with the components on it but also
while we were visiting penpen we got his
first sample of the icon ellentube pot
so that's what this is this is a liquid
nitrogen pot it is four GPUs and you can
tell that it's got a wider contact area
so for the big die GPU taurine cards
this would be mounted to those we hope
to use it soon not sure what will try it
on it might try it on a lower-end card
first just in case something goes wrong
my end but you can see all the holes
internally for increased surface area so
that's something that Vince worked on
getting custom made is increasing
service area he increased the contact
area for the GPU die and then for the
rest still has the kingpin cooling logo
on it and the gun which I'm told that
this gun gets Vince a lot of trouble
with this product because customs looks
at them and thinks that their gun parts
but they're not they're liquid nitrogen
pots and clearly everyone knows the
difference so that's some of the stuff
we got from EVGA we also got a few
things from MSI so these are from MSI
they are gauges for keep out zones
there's a keep out zone on motherboards
where parts aren't supposed to go and
the point of that keep out zone just
like on a GPU is to ensure that there is
no componentry where you're gonna have a
cooler so these are older they didn't
need them anymore hence giving them to
us and this is an LGA 1156 this is 2011
LGA and either of these are meant for
this board but the way it works is if
you have a board that it is meant for
you've got the pins on there and these
just socket into the holes so if there's
a thread ripper one but it would sock it
into the holes and then you can check if
any components on the diagram would fall
inside of the keep out zone and if they
do then you know that there's a problem
and it needs to be redesigned to make
sure all the coolers can fit so for
these examples keep
zones a bit wider as opposed to the
really densely packed dims on a TR
socket board and these are just used in
design they we asked them you know why
is this one bigger and there was really
no answer for it because the keypad zone
is strictly on the the flat plane it's
it's not a vertical thing so it's just
that's just how Intel made them but
anyway some cool stuff you don't
typically get to see you can see that it
kind of follows the shape of the Intel
stock cooler it's got the pegs to go in
the holes mount it and then make sure
all the components clear and that's how
you determine if your motherboard will
be compliant with the average CPU cooler
so just some kind of behind the scenes
stuff not not something you can really
buy let's look at some of the stuff we
bought next so this is a I don't
remember the exact brand name I I want
to say it was home sure and technically
this motherboard is branded by a
different company it's I asked them for
motherboard box and this is all they had
so this is not the same as the company
that makes the board but I will draw
your attention to the fact that it says
it supports the Intel Core 2 Duo the
Core 2 quad and the Athlon x2 and the
phenom x4 and it has an Intel chipset
apparently it also allegedly supports
DDR one two and three so whatever this
motherboard was really I want this one
but I think they probably just threw
everything on the box so then maybe put
a sticker over the ones that weren't
relevant maybe anyway let's look at the
actual board it's it's just a Mac 79
board it was cheap we picked this up at
s e-g watchon Bay and in the Shenzhen
and I sort of negotiated with them over
it a little bit but it's just a cheap
x79 board from a brand
we're not personally familiar with I'm
not familiar with and we'll try it out
and see you know how how good the board
is we have some other x79 projects going
on right now
so this will fit in with those and we
can just plug the same CPUs right into
the board but anyway it's a that's
really all there was to it I think it
was about maybe $50 u.s. so it was
between 40 and 60 for this
and think they wanted like 60 to 70 I
negotiated a bit got them to like 40 or
50 somewhere in there and that's all I
mean it just comes with an IO plate and
the motherboard and that's it and the
BIOS should have an English version as
well all the characters on the board are
our romanized characters so we should be
good there I bought this from the same
shop so this is a downdraft CPU cooler
and this was about two or three US
dollars after the conversion so this is
one of the cheaper things you could get
and the brand is yaku and it actually
looks very similar to some of the other
downdraft coolers we have can't remember
Rajyam tech I think we have a downdraft
rise in tech cooler that looks very
similar to this but anyway it's in
theory a copper heatsink maybe copper
plated though I can't tell but it might
be copper plated aluminum I'm not sure
but copper heat sink in theory with the
a or actually with an aluminum coldplay
okay while that answers that question so
I think it's actually that's an aluminum
cold plate for sure and I'm now
confident it's an aluminum heatsink you
spotted hiss but for two or three bucks
who cares we'll see how good it is this
is a I think we have the the fit the
hardware to mount this on to modern
intel and AMD sockets so we can get it
on any one of our CPUs and motherboards
this next one I negotiated on a little
harder so this was on the second or
third floor of s e-g the e market and
it's obviously it's just like a GoPro
competitor and it even actually uses a
it uses genuine GoPro mounting hardware
so I have a hero 5 or I think I have a
hero 5 and a hero 4 for that I use for
mountain biking so my plan is to stick
one of those high end hero GoPro
products I'm on my helmet stick one of
these on Mohammed
a couple runs and see how they footage
compares to the supposed to be 4k the
shopkeeper showed me this versus another
4k camera they had and all she said was
this one 4k good and that one 4k no good
so we'll see how good it is this is
actually hero to housing I'm pretty
confident if if not it's very close cuz
I had a hero too and it worked about
exactly like this so it's got the
airtight gasket here I mean it's it's
like a it's real product for sure it's
not that much of a fake but there's a
gasket that will keep out the water if
you were to submerge it so let's see if
this is a GoPro standard battery no it
is not but it is a 900 milliamp hour
battery we can get a shot of that and
show the specs three point three point
three three watt hours 900 milliamp
hours three point seven volt lithium-ion
battery so I guess we'll see I'll give
this a shot on one of the bike runs and
compared verses the GoPro cameras that I
have compared against the hero 2 or
something as well I negotiated pretty
hard on this like I said so we got the
camera and the stupid SmartWatch I
didn't particularly want but we got both
of these for cheap dishes son by Sansa
ok well my my Ichi sir bye sure ok only
this one then only sunbae sunbae ok
so bye sheriff took a she wanted
330 RMB for the camera I don't remember
exactly that can will put the conversion
on the screen or something but 330 RMB
for the camera and then she wanted like
200 rmb for the watch and I think with
my broken Chinese and her broken English
we came to an agreement to do 450 for
both so anyway this is 150 bucks we also
I guess I'll show this we had a enough
tea from one of the factory owners that
it could probably have gotten us in
trouble for smuggling or something
because he gave us here's a lot but I
guess one of the factory owners also
owns a tea company that makes tea from
Taiwan I don't know he was based in
China the tea comes from Taiwan I know
nothing about tea I believe Keegan is
our resident expert there so he's gonna
try it out and see if it's any good but
we had some while we were visiting the
factories and by my untrained taste buds
it was pretty good so there's the brand
but this was just given to us sure you
can buy it it was as a thank you for
visiting their Factory they were a it's
one of the factory presidents that we
spoke with and I think from the
neighboring factories Coolermaster gave
us this stuff so this is a CNC GM logo
on the cooler master badge with cooler
master written on the back of course so
that was just made out of CNC just kind
of a demo to show how the CNCs work but
we can drop some footage in of one of
the CNC machines here and then they also
gave us one of these which is a bent
heat pipe I actually technically made
this one in that we were given straight
heat pipes we were given the bending
tool and then shown how heat pipe
bending actually works and we have a
separate video showing the entire start
to finish process of how heat pipe
right so that's kind of cool to picked
up these maybe copper heat sinks they're
like memories GDD are sighs heat sinks
so we bought some of these and it's just
really to have around for video card
mods and also I wasted a bunch of their
time asking about how much stuff cost
that I wanted to buy something so the
shop that I bought these from told them
I wanted 12 and they sort of laughed
because these shops are used to working
with order quantities on the tens of
thousands or at least thousands for
projects locally so you can go to watch
on BAE s e-g and buy all the parts you
need to make a we'll get to these in a
moment to make a phone if you wanted to
you can get all the SMD is there and
everything and speaking of phones this
is one of the ones from a a real brand
so this is from Oppo and Oppo I believe
owns oneplus so it's a brand that you're
likely familiar with the phone is a
legitimate phone but it was cheap and so
that's why I picked it up just to see
what it was
what's you know what's kind of the
quality level what is it compared to
because in that marketplace you can get
phones knockoff were legitimate like
this one is is a real brand for pretty
cheap and this one I think the guy
wanted 100 USD originally and I ended up
buying this for somewhere between I
think it was about 70 70 to 80 somewhere
in there it's not really a big discount
but picked up the phone we've got some
software we can test on it so we do some
oh nice got that boot up music so we
have some software to play around with
it needs to be configured and everything
it can be set to English or Chinese so
we should be good there but either way
we have some uses for it internally with
our test hardware and that's the phone
we picked up from the same shop I got
this which is not a Bose speaker so of
course when I opened my wallet to pay
for the phone the shopkeeper saw and
these are like small stalls in the place
saw my wallet was loaded with money
because we had just visited Hong
and Taiwan and so I had all different
currencies in there and he said oh you
have you have much money and I said no I
really really don't and so that he
pulled out this speaker and the fun
thing about this speaker is in the back
of the stall
they had a heat gun and there was
another another person working in the
back of the stall heat treating logos on
two different products so he was even
heat treating like Apple logos on to
Oppo phones for example we're on to just
other brand phones and Samsung logos and
so this was a Bose logo that is heat
treated on - and glued on to this
speaker which is not a legitimate po
speaker but it is actually very good
there's no point in us trying to demo it
because it be through a microphone but
pretty good I forget what I paid for
this but it was not a lot and we got
that with the phone these things are
pretty cool
so we saw on the tenth floor the final
floor of SE g e market there was a game
store and i actually i did not try to
haggle with this store at all they
seemed pretty established it was it was
a less of like a flea market stall which
is kind of like the format of that place
and more of an actual shop so I didn't
try haggling at all I just paid the
prices and they were low anyway I think
I think this was like 80 RMB this where
this was 80 RMDs was like 10 to 12
dollars and this was maybe like $18 u.s.
something like that so it's got
621 games in it obviously these are SNES
controllers so and they're they're
pretty damn close to SNES controllers at
that materials are a little bit
different but the controller itself is
the same design and what we were
wondering the reason Andrew and I bought
this is because we're wondering if this
device here surpasses the quality of the
classic the SNES classic and NES classic
that Nintendo recently made so we're
curious if it surpasses the quality of
those it
more games and they're not fake games
either I mean they're real Nintendo
games like Super Mario is on here along
with 620 other games and they're just
roms they're just roms that were burned
onto the device you can play them with
an SNES controller plugged into it and
it was super cheap and so we figured it
might be kind of fun to play around with
so we'll test that in a maybe a future
content piece but I think does it have a
product name super many SFC name of the
product and we'll try that out
separately but pretty cool it was cheap
the next one I played on the plane on
the way home for a little bit for as
long as I can tolerate it this one's 129
games 8-bit 2.4 inch screen 2
lithium-ion battery in there it's
actually a phone battery and this is I
think by the same company I'm not
positive on that though but it's it's
just a game but I look like boots
instantly we'll get some b-roll this
it's got Super Mario I'm there it's got
other get a ninja turtles on there all
four of these I think NES or SNES
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle games and as
stated it's just a straight Wow
just to see I'm not any better on this
then the other just a straight ROM so
that was the one I was like 10 to 12
bucks
other stuff small things we got so
SmartWatch I'm not a really a watch
person but we got it relatively cheap
with the camera and this one has the
ability to add a SIM card it can connect
the phones I'm gonna try it out use it
biking as well because I can play music
off the speakers in the watch that's
kind of nice get a little closer to my
head and then I can run like Strava on
it or something so we'll try that out
see if it's any good but there's very
much one of those like you know why not
we're here and it's cheap so we walked
by this and the guy selling it saw that
andrew is shooting it with the sony
camera and the guy got my attention and
I respected that respected that hustle
so we bought it I think this is a 32
gigabyte USB 2 it's
Kingston DataTraveler and what he did we
have some footage of it but he in the
market tour he just takes the USB key
and sticks it into the rubber mold and
there's your there's your novelty USB
the housing with the USB device in it I
don't know that we'll actually use these
I will scrub them for security reasons
first if we do but the main point was to
show that you could if you wanted by
tens of thousands of lilo and stitch or
Donald Duck or whatever other brand or
character USB drives you want and it's I
mean it's it's not policed at all so
clearly this is not okay within US
copyright or intellectual property laws
but not really a problem in SE GE market
which is also it's good and bad the the
good side is that you get things like
really cheap competitive phones that are
actually pretty good and and then the
bad side is that if you actually have
intellectual property that you want to
defend it's basically impossible to do
so so that's the stuff we bought some
really cool stuff some kind of lame
stuff just depends the gifts were I
think more interesting like this keep
out zone mounts or gauges the kingpin
blank PCB is really cool and then the
Allen teapots actually very functional
that's everything we got them that's
what we got in China and in Taiwan we
were in both for about a week each we'll
be back for Computex will be back in May
early June and we'll try and pick up
some more stuff but it was just kind of
fun it's it's really genuinely fun to
walk around a place where there's a
10-story electronics market filled with
things like if you want it meters upon
meter like hundreds of meters of RGB
LEDs you can get thousands of SM D's on
wheels so you can get like BIOS chips on
wheels buy 10,000 units if you want and
it's just cool to see which is really
why we want because where we are there
the only electronic store is Best Buy
which doesn't count
and we don't need have Fry's or micro
Center and then this place is still
bigger than fries and micro Center and
it's way cooler stuff it's just more
interesting now on the component side a
lot of the motherboards and the video
cards are older a lot of people think
that if you go to china video cards or
motherboards would be cheaper because
it's the closest to the source it's made
there but actually in reality it's
typically a bit more expensive to buy
the full complete modern components in
China or Taiwan and it's really where it
gets interesting or where you can get
cheaper parts and stuff like this or
stuff like x79 motherboards are really
cheap right now over in Asia we saw a
lot of those for for dirt cheap and
they're pretty good boards too and then
older video cards are also not too bad
so so a lot of the modern components
like r-tx stuff it's not cheaper but
then you get into things like
peripherals and a lot of the margins cut
out you get peripherals pretty cheap and
you just get random things that you
couldn't buy in the US - so that's it
for this one thank you for watching as
