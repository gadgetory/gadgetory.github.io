accessed on that and what you're looking
at is our newest benchmark course for
Star Wars Battlefront this is for our
updated GPU benchmarks that I've on the
site already and these were conducted
after the phone launched version of the
game so this is updated from our beta
benchmark which was conducted on
Tatooine the reason that we chose Endor
for our new test bed is because it
presents a mixed workload environment
for the GPU so it's not full load it's
not murdering the GPU as some levels are
capable of doing but it is still
reasonably loaded and is something that
you would encounter in a real-world
scenario especially with multiplayer
gaming which is of course the focus of a
game like battle front end or makes use
of dense meshes there's a lot of high
mesh quality objects in the level
there's a lot of ambient occlusion going
on and other lighting effects from the
light sources cascading through occluded
and partially occluded objects if you
were to look around the level you would
see that and then there's varying levels
of detail object detail mesh detail and
things of that nature ground coverage
foliage within the end or map so that is
our updated test bench course for star
wars battlefront you can check the
website or the link in the description
below for the full GPU benchmark within
star wars battlefront and then we've got
some other cool content like a cpu
benchmark coming out shortly as well so
stay tuned for that if you like this
kind of content as always hit that
patreon link in the postural video and

watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
