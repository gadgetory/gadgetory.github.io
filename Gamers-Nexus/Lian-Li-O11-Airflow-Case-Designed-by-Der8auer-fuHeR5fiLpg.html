at CES 2018 they have a couple new cases
that are pretty interesting and actually
one that mr. dare Bauer helped out with
one of the cases that we be talking
about today so hopefully it will have
the German perfected engineering that he
always claims to have we'll see how that
goes as we walk through them though
before that this video is brought to you
by EVGA and the X 299 dark motherboard
for the Intel high-end desktop CPUs the
X 299 dark is one of the only
motherboards on the market with proper
vrm cooling we've tested this and found
significant performance increase over
those without active cooling on the BRMS
this board was used in our recent
attempt to set a top-10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x29 dark at the link in the description
below so let's start with the new O 11
first they've gotten rid of the PC
prefix basically so there's two versions
the O 11 dynamic and the O 11 air this
one is the 11 dynamic the primary
difference between them is the glass
paneling the 11 dynamic has tempered
glass panels on the left and on the
front on the backside it's got a steel
panel that has some meshing on the back
because you can mount a radiator right
here and push air out that way for
radiators the case supports three 360s
so you knew 360 bottom 360 here 360 top
and of course the smaller size is in
between if you prefer you can just do
fan intake as well the air version of
the case will have two variants to SKUs
one with zero fans just like this
dynamic version zero fans included and
the other SKU will probably include six
fans this is kind of still TBD some of
this stuff but the six fan version three
of them will be black and white in the
front and then three RGB on the side
right here you can move them as you see
fit the interesting thing with this kind
of intake and exhaust setup is that
because the power supply has been moved
out of the main compartment which we'll
get to in a minute you can do bottom
intake and in our testing generally
speaking if you do bottom intake it's
the most beneficial to the GPU because
it has the most direct access to the air
and if you mount it horizontally it'll
go straight into the face of the card so
thermally it should be pretty sound
the air version of the case does not
have this glass front it's
Grill instead we have b-roll of that
it's got a grill on the top as well and
this is because Leon Lee doesn't
particularly like the look of a steel
mesh so they've replaced it with a
plastic grill instead and I think it
looks fine it's up to you to decide how
it looks you can discuss in the comments
below
well test thermally later but yeah that
should resolve some of the thermal
concerns that we've seen in the industry
with flat fronts with glass or whatever
they are if that's not good enough
though you can do bottom intake still on
top exhaust as always or you can do side
mounted exhaust for other there are a
lot of features on this case for one of
the other ones they do have a vertical
GPU mount as you see used here
you can install a different bracket and
mount in a more traditional fashion if
you prefer with the vertical GPU mount
one thing I notice is that it's set a
little maybe two and a half inches back
from the glass panel so typically
vertical GPU you'll do an open-loop
block on it not really a thermal concern
if you do have an air cooled card
mounted like this being pushed up
against the glass like 99% of the cases
we talked about last year it will
suffocate and it will drop clocks so
being pushed back a bit is helpful and
is probably a touch from their Bauer I
would assume so that's good and then
power supplies as I mentioned moved out
of the main compartment to the back
there are actually two power supply
options for mounting you could choose
either one and the other one if you
don't use to PSU is you can put a hard
drive cage in there hard drives if you
don't need them there you could install
two power supplies it's up to you to buy
your own splitter or whatever you want
to use for that but if you have a use
case for two I guess you could do it
there's not a lot of them but there is
an option there and then if you don't
use it it's still functional as a hard
drive cage backside has a cable
management bar it's really just kind of
one-sided there's not it doesn't
completely enclose the cables like some
of the other cases on the market and you
can install more drives on that one hard
drive or two SSDs if you prefer or a
hard drive in an SSD one more thing I'll
mention here on this build is the liquid
cooler so this is actually a prototype
doesn't even have a name yet
it probably comes from a Paul Tech or
one of those other manufacturers
suppliers we've talked about in the past
it's got the pump currently pushed
through the rain
which is kind of interesting I would
assume to circumvent ASA tax patent
where they basically say anyone who puts
bump there gets sued out of existence so
that's probably the choice for that we
don't know if this will come to market
but I did want to point it out because
it's in the case though it looks kind of
cool
Leon Lee wants your feedback on this
those leave comments below if you want
to talk about that prices the dynamic
version of the case should be around
$130 include zero fans it's more
targeted at water cooling has a lot of
water cooling support full reservoir
support you could mount one back there
as well that's up to you to supply the
fans the air version no fans for the
hundred twenty dollar SKU and then 150
probably for the six fan ski which is
actually pretty good deal I think that
covers most of these cases there's a lot
of features with them but we're gonna
move on to the fusion elite case next
this case is part of the land cool brand
this is generally speaking it's going to
be cases that are a bit more affordable
Lee only tends to do expensive stuff so
it's made by them but it's under the
land cold brand it's called the fusion
elite here's where this one gets
interesting so it's got an aluminum face
basically glued onto the plastic front
panel and then you have tempered glass
on the side the rest of its all steel
and it's got a bit of a looks approach
to it which we don't really do too much
of however there's a cutout in the front
where the fans can actually breathe this
is where this one gets interesting we've
talked in the past you may remember the
H 500 P or similar cases and if we
talked in the past about how anything
with an enclosed front not only are you
suffocating the fans but also every time
error has to do a 90 degree turn you're
losing a lot of pressure from the air so
this gives direct intake access for the
fans they are partially covered so you
could go wider they would breed better
obviously but there's a point of
diminishing returns up until you go to a
mesh front panel so we'll have to test
and see how effective that is versus
smaller versions if we taped it off or
something there's still some side and
take this might shrink a bit before the
final design it's not completely
finalized but in the very least you do
have intake here and there's an LED
strip on the back of that split so right
here there's an LED strip that signs
signs back into the case it's
going to shine out and blind you but the
interesting part is it allows Lian Li to
use black and white fans without LEDs so
they're reducing the cost of the case
obviously cost you by not needing to
worry about LED fans they're more
expensive than just a strip there was
talk of potentially doing a strip in the
top if we have b-roll at the top there's
some asymmetry there they're still
looking at it and going to finalise it
later so don't focus too much on that
for today and then the top panel this
grill right here pulls up pretty easily
rather than a magnetic dust filter this
one should include three fans probably
black and white non LED at $90 and we'll
revisit it later once it's closer to
launch other than that it's got a power
supply shroud and that about covers it
so I think that's most of the stuff at
the Leon Lee's suite at CES 2018 as
always you can subscribe for more i'll
go to patreon.com/scishow and exes in
the link in the description below for
more information where we may also have
an article on some of these cases if you
want further information on them so
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
