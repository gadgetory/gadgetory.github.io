topic that we've discussed before right
after the launch of the 8700 k most
recently it'll become even more
important over the next few weeks and
that's for a few reasons for one intel
is launching its new B&amp;amp;H chipset soon
and that will require some performance
testing and validation and for two AMD
is launching its rise in 2000 series
chips on April 19th and those will
include
xfr - some x4 70 boards just like some X
370 boards will have MCE
look-alike options but they're not
exactly the same for Intel and AMD both
enabling MCE or core performance boost
means running a higher clock speed and
depending on which setting you're
talking about it could exit
specification particularly the power
specification and that mostly applies
for low-end coolers the question is if
any motherboard vendors enable MCE on
Intel by default or silently because
that's where results can become muddy
for buyers before that this video is
brought to you by EVGA and the X 299
dark motherboard for the Intel high end
desktop CPUs the X 299 dark is one of
the only motherboards on the market with
proper vrm cooling we've tested this and
found a significant performance increase
over those without active cooling on the
brms this board was used in our recent
attempt to set a top-10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
x-29 dark at the link in the description
below there's been a lot of update since
the last time we talked about multi-core
enhancement but again the biggest one
here is that we need to revisit it in
preparation for B Series and H series
chipset testing where we'll be looking
at some of the previous Intel CPUs we've
reviewed again except on motherboards
that are more appropriate for them the
i-5 non K CPU the i3 non K CPUs though
it CPUs we've basically said from the
start deserve to be on a non Z series
motherboard and it's time to review
those again re review those on the newer
lower end boards so that we can get a
realistic look at how they'll perform in
a use case that makes sense so ramping
into that then we wanted to revisit MCE
part of revisiting imce as stated is
also in preparation
Rison - or the 2000 series rising CPUs
which we'll be launching on April 19th
and for that launch we'll be looking at
some new performance options on X 470
motherboards that weren't fully present
or present in the same fashion on the
original rise in CPUs so we'll be
looking at in r7 1700 today with poor
performance boost it's not the same as a
Massey II but just looking at the name
of it it sounds the same that's an
option in most BIOS versions 4 X 370
motherboards and then we'll be looking
at the i7 8700 K with MCE
multi-core enhancement on the Intel
motherboards before ramping into a lot
of charts there's a lot of data here
some quick information on MCE and core
performance boost if you're not familiar
with either multi-core enhancement or
MCE is basically a feature that's on
some not all Intel motherboards and it's
a manufacturer created feature this is
something that asus or gigabyte or folks
like that would have a hand in not Intel
it's a non Intel feature and MCE is also
a non stock feature multi-core
enhancement by default is basically
built to run the CPU at its maximum
single core turbo except across all
cores
generally speaking actually always
speaking this will also increase your
power consumption so it will exit the
power specification that is assigned by
the CPU manufacturer core performance
boost meanwhile on AMD motherboards is
more to do with the precision boost and
xfr features on Rison platforms and rise
in cpus so it behaves a bit differently
the clock speed is still impacted but
it's impacted for a different reason
rather than maxing out single core
across all cores what's happening is you
are applying xfr and precision boost
across the CPU as expected by an these
specifications it's get into the test
platform now before the numbers so for
testing we only use Cinebench this time
and we tip we've actually replaced
Cinebench with blender for all of our
benchmarking for rendering application
workloads that's mostly because people
actually use blender as an application
to make things and render things and
also because we found blender to have a
whole lot less variance we also build
our
own in-house blender benchmarks so we
have total control over them which gives
us a lot more confidence in testing
Cinebench however is good for a very
quick and comparable synthetic benchmark
so we're using that today in the course
of running Cinebench we ran it without
any logging software at all for these
Cinebench numbers we present and then
when we start presenting things like
frequency power characteristics things
like that we use hardware info running
while Cinebench is running but we're not
average in the results from those
Cinebench rounds while hardware info is
running because it influences them a bit
so that's the first thing you need to
know secondly need to know is four
components for the Intel systems what
we're using are a couple of other words
we have an ACS maximus X Heroes III 70
motherboard we have a gigabyte XIII 70
Ultra gaming we have an MSI XIII 70 I
gaming Pro carbon I TX board for the
Intel other components in that bench
we used an 80 700 K it's deleted but
that's irrelevant here and we also have
four memory Corsair Vengeance lpx
thirty-two hundred megahertz at sixteen
eighteen 1836 for its XMP profile XMP I
guess and that's 2 by 16 gigabyte sticks
we're also using an EVGA 750 watt
supernova g2 for the power supply and an
EVGA 1080i FTW 3 for the graphics card
which is irrelevant along with a Kraken
X 62 cooler just to make sure we're not
thermal throttling anywhere for the AMD
systems we're using an ACS crosshair 6
hero motherboard X 370 on six thousand
one beta bios we are also using an r7
1700 review sample we're using the guile
32 hundred megahertz CL 16 memory
provided by AMD for the RF 5 review ages
ago now and for the power supply and
NZXT Hale 9 TB to GPU 1080i FTW 3 and
cooler also a Kraken X 62 we moved on
again from Cinebench for blender
previously but now's a good time to
reintroduce Cinebench for some of this
testing this testing started out with an
ASUS Maximus 10 or Maximus X motherboard
which received after the initial launch
reviews of the i7 8700 K our starting
board was the gigabyte Z 370 ultra
gaming it was a shame too that we
received the Maximus later because we
were able to overclock far better on the
maximum
ten and that was with the help of
reduced V droop which we had on earlier
visions of BIOS for the gigabyte ultra
gaming board and better bios options
also a wet way better
erm on the Maximus motherboard in fact
the ultra gaming was so problematic that
gigabyte is now introducing an ultra
gaming z3 70 V to motherboard v 1.0
that's actually it's actually the name
of it it's the Ultra gaming v2 1.0 as
opposed to the Ultra gaming v1 1.0
because we can't iterate 1.0 obviously
and make it 2.0 but there is a
significant difference between them so
to be clear we're using the original one
and for this first set of results look
at the Asus board here's our test matrix
for the ASUS Maximus 10 motherboard we
ran tests for all the stuff in the
charts here the first one is complete
auto settings as reset from default not
even with XMP MCE is auto second one
auto settings with MCE explicitly
disabled still without XMP next one do
CP enabled the asus version of XMP
presets and then answering no to the
prompt MCE auto next one is do CP
enabled and answering no to the prompts
then disabling MCE explicitly next do CP
enabled answering yes to the prom MC e
auto and finally do CP enabled answering
yes to the prompt MC e explicitly
disabled as you can see there's a lot of
testing going on here for just one board
so we have a lot of data to go through
because there's Cinebench frequency
performance and power performance for
each motherboard note also that ACS only
offers auto or disabled for multi-core
enhancement with the BIOS revision we're
using which is exceptionally confusing
for the end user we would strongly
encourage Asus to add an explicit
enabled and disabled option perhaps
along with Auto as opposed to what
presently exists which is you can either
choose off or lol idk that's basically
two options because Auto doesn't tell
you what it's going to do so we'd like
to see enabled and disabled explicitly
but that's what we have right now after
enabling XMP or do CP as Asus calls it
Asus will prompt you yes or no on
further changes we tested both options
let's start with Cinnabon
scores will have frequency and power
next for the asus motherboard we logged
scores as seen on the screen now with do
CP on yes' selected an MC e set to auto
we scored 1445 multi-threaded average
for Cinebench or 197 single-threaded and
that's after multiple passes averaged
selecting no but leaving do CP on and MC
e to auto we scored within margin of
error for Cinebench which has a lot more
variance than you'd expect and thus is
why we dropped it for the more reliable
and usable blender tests regardless
we're at 14 43 and 199 here explicitly
disabling MC e gives us another
equivalent score 1439 multi-threaded 197
single-threaded these are within margin
of error of the first few tests
explicitly disabling MC e on selecting
no when prompted
we again land within margin of error
1441 and 196 going full stock meaning no
XMP on the memory we landed at 14 32
multi-threaded and 196 single threaded
the MC e auto results were within margin
of error of the MC e disabled results
after this we sent an email to asus
asking what MC e actually does on this
motherboard because it appears that on
the version of bios we have which will
mention and the article as well MC e
does nothing right now but we haven't
tested the newest version of bios on
this motherboard because we're trying to
see what performance looked like with
the first public release as opposed to
our initial testing which used a
pre-release bios we'll revisit this
topic with the asus board later once all
of the finalized intel security patches
come out and things like that so this
might come down to the beta bios or
whatever we're running presently being
bugged
but either way we'll revisit the topic
when ACS ships a finalized BIOS version
for upcoming CPUs we would assume it'll
have 1 + or 4 security patches with
Intel of course those are getting
updates as well let's look at
frequencies just for validation looking
at frequencies do CPEs and MCE auto
resulted in an average at
single-threaded frequency of 4550 3.6
megahertz on the 8700 k multi-threaded
was 42 99 this is expected and matches
the Intel turbo boost table do CP no and
MC e Auto
resulted in a single-threaded frequency
of 45 41
9 megahertz within margin of error of
our averaging and test to test variance
multi-threaded was 42 99 we're looking
for differences equal to or in Access of
100 megahertz do see P yes and MCE
explicitly disabled the US forty five
thirty eight megahertz single threaded
and multi-threaded was 42 99 do CB know
MCE explicitly disabled to gave us 45 56
and $42.99 multi-threaded this again is
completely within Cinebench is
relatively wide variance we have an
established range of about 23 megahertz
single-threaded and basically 1
megahertz multi-threaded full stock
settings with MCE off gave us 45 67
megahertz single or 43 20 multi the big
difference here was disabling do CPR XMP
resulting in a 20 megahertz change still
this is not reaching those higher clock
bins and that's under auto auto settings
with MCE set to auto gave us 45 59
megahertz single or 43:19 multi we chalk
this up to being a potentially buggy
bios but we revisit this once bios is
ratified and released publicly for the
new cpus coming out and for security
patches as for power consumption also
for validation we observed approximately
104 to 108 watts consumption during
multi-threaded workloads for all tests
the stock tests without XMP were closer
to 96 watts the range run to run was
approximately 4 watts which is within
reasonable variance a Seuss's Maximus
10 results with the bios used to seem to
indicate that MCE is either bugged or
non-functional with this set of testing
we'll have to revisit either older BIOS
revisions or upcoming BIOS revisions for
more one final note we previously did
testing with MCE on the asus board and
noted that it was functional at least
somewhat but it seems to have been
broken in one of the later revisions and
part of this is because in the earlier
testing we noted that some of the MCE
tests would result in blue screens I
think that was with blender if I
remember correctly and that was because
the CPU was running voltages too low for
the frequencies MCE was pushing thus
causing an in stable overclocked
unstable overclock or a crash and so we
obviously recommended against using that
and manually overclocking if that's what
you wanted to move on to gigabyte
gigabytes z 370 ultra gaming's next this
one took some extra effort because we
had to dig up old pre-release BIOS
revisions for
testing and these are BIOS revisions
that we use during our review period and
we're important to digging deeper into
MCE in a heavier fashion here's a chart
of the test matrix for gigabyte first
BIOS f5 at complete stock MC Auto by OS
f5 at stock MC e explicitly disabled by
OS f5 with XMP enabled at MC e auto f5
with XMP enabled MC e disabled f5 with
XMP enabled MC e enabled and the first
release bios f4 at stock which came out
publicly with board MC e auto
pre-release bios f3 at stock MC e auto
and initial bios f2 with XMP and no MC e
option present here's where it gets
interesting with that last option with
bios version f2 which is what the
motherboard shipped with for the review
units or at least ours the gigabyte
conversation we had previously we
explicitly asked if MC e was present on
the board and whether it was disabled or
enabled by default and gigabyte had
indicated to us that they believed in
completely disabling MC e for stock
testing and noted that it would be
disabled for this board by default we
also asked these questions because there
was no MC e option in gigabytes f2
version of the bios so even if you
suspected it to be present it wasn't
something you could see or change from
what we've seen with our review version
of f2 and on that note took us a while
to find version f2 because we saved it
to an old USB key and fortunately still
had it on there because it was a
pre-release bios it's not publicly
available and the later versions came
out that were f4 and f5 a were used for
other testing for game testing we used
BIOS revision f4 or beta f5 a these were
explicitly switched to for game
benchmarking as we were told by gigabyte
that f4 and f5 a would impact GT X 1080
and 1080i perforins on the ultra gaming
we'd already run our synthetic round on
BIOS revision 2 and we're told at the
time that there shouldn't be any CPU
only performance differences between the
revisions outside of the GV performance
issues so then we ran f2 for Cinebench
pov-ray at all but ran f5 a or f4
for game testing let's get into the
Cinebench numbers for bios version f5
multi-threaded Cinebench performance
Landsat 14 23 points for f5 stock XMP
often MCE auto there's an MC II option
in f5 unlike f2 received 193 for single
threaded at 5 stock MC disabled got us
14 21 points this indicates that on at
least efi f5 MC e is disabled by default
as gigabyte said one left to auto efi f5
x and p on MCE auto we score 14 27
points reasonable as memory is now
faster f5 with XMP and MC e explicitly
disabled further supports that MC e is
disabled by default on version f5 f5
with XMP and MC e explicitly enabled
gives us 15 forty five points
multi-threaded finalizing that MC is
disabled by default on version f5 and we
then tested efi version f4 a complete
stock MCE auto we scored 14 23 and 193
points and that again shows MC e is off
by default with f4 ya 5 version f3 same
thing same performance and then after
digging through those old flash drives
to find f2 bios revision we found the
culprit here there's no MC option in
this bios revision and although gigabyte
did later embrace that MC each should be
disabled by default the initial BIOS
revision had no MC e option and MC e was
in fact enabled by default silently and
there was no way to explicitly disable
it in that version of BIOS that shipped
on our board anyway so then all the
scores would be in the 1500 for
Cinebench and still faster for
single-threaded at 204 the same is true
for XMP enabled with efi f2 efi revision
f2 with MC e automatically enabled ends
up with a performance uplift of
approximately 7.7 27.8% over stock for
Cinebench as we're reaching the max
turbo frequency for one core but applied
to all of course and for frequency
here's what we saw for efi f5 all
instances with MC e off or MC auto we
had a frequency of 43 hundred megahertz
all core the correct value given Intel's
frequency tables that are publicly
visible through X to you they're not
hiding them but they're also not really
pushing them anymore
package power consumption was
approximately 87 watts explicitly
enabling MC e and F 5 resulted in 40
700 megahertz frequency this exit stock
spec naturally gives a boost of 7.8%
again we used f4 and f5 a for our gaming
tests and the behavior is correct with
MCE auto on these revisions for efi f2
the frequency matches efi f5 with MC
enabled 4700 mega it's all for power
consumption also goes up with the higher
frequencies and voltages naturally we're
at 87 watts average for MC disabled or
115 for n abled the next question is why
why did gigabyte shipped like this with
f2 enabling MCE by default and also not
having an option to disable it well we
talked to gigabyte back then and we also
talked to a lot of other motherboard
makers at the time and we've revisited
the topic now but basically when we
released our initial MCE benchmark video
months ago at around the time of the
8700 you
motherboard makers noted to us that they
were anxious that their competitors
other motherboard makers would enable
MCE by default which of course pushes
them to consider enabling MCE by default
this is because the motherboard vendors
particularly the higher-ups as we
understand it don't want to look at
charts of reviews of Intel processors
and see that their motherboards are
scoring lower than their competitors
when there's really no good reason for
that to be the case
aside from BIOS differences well there's
one good reason it turns out of course
it's MCE
so that's why you see some of the boards
or some of the earlier BIOS revisions
enabling MCE by default it's because the
board makers were concerned that they
would look bad in charts because their
competitors ran CPUs functionally out of
spec now fortunately it looks like some
of these have been turned around
gigabyte has corrected this and disabled
them to e by default on later revisions
of BIOS so we give the gigabyte credit
for that at least but it would have been
nice to have it properly done the first
time either way it was just a day or two
before the review went live that another
BIOS revision came out f4 f5 8 and the
revision also fixed some GPU performance
issues so we use that for game testing
the motherboard vendors here want to
compete with each other it's not some
Intel driven plot or conspiracy to make
Intel CPUs look better this comes down
to motherboard manufacturers and it's up
to really everyone to make sure that MCE
stays disabled by default as it should
be for motherboards because from the
folks
spoken with it sounds like there's
pressure internally for MCE to be
enabled if any of the competing
motherboard makers decide to enable it
by default because they'll instantly
make everyone else look worse if MCE
isn't discussed in that equation so
they're mostly competing that's what it
comes down to we always aim the test
with MCE disabled we were told it was
disabled with the ultra gaming version
f2 clearly that wasn't the case but
fortunately the gaming results remain
accurate on BIOS version f4 and f5 a
which came out a bit later and included
1060 1070 1080 and up performance fixes
that were present on BIOS version f2 as
for what we think of MCE here we're a
bit disappointed that motherboard makers
even think about enabling MCE
automatically by default at all because
in some testing we've done again you can
experience blue screens instability and
crashes and if you're an end-user who
maybe knows nothing or a little about
BIOS that's not an option you'd think to
disable there is zero reason as an
uninformed user you'd think my system is
blue screening I'm gonna go into BIOS
and then you'd see an option called this
makes everything better and disable it
there's no reason you would do that
because multi-core enhancement doesn't
sound like something that causes a blue
screen it sounds quite good and if it's
on auto why would you change it so we
strongly believe it needs to be off it's
unfortunate that some of the vendors
have defaulted it to on but it does look
like most of them are actually moving to
default by off by now so later as e3
Sony ultra gaming revisions for example
were part of that and all this comes
down to voltage tables LLC tables as
well under auto setting is not always
the best as we've discussed before
you'll have to keep a careful eye on
this for B and H boards but more
importantly for rise in two thousand
CPUs with XFR to something we'll be
looking at and we have some data on that
that we can share later of course the
last Intel board we tested was the MSI
gt70 eye gaming Pro carbon which has EFI
version 7b for three version eleven
installed we only needed two tests for
this one so it'll be quick with stocks
that ends our Cinebench score was
fourteen thirty point seven points or
196 single threaded enabling XMP gave us
an expected uplift to 1439
that's all we needed to test we did not
see MCE option on this board but some
manufacturers actually do
Auto enable MCE with XMP or have in the
past so we wanted to at least make sure
nothing similarly sneaky was going on
with these III 70 I and XMP this one
seems fine moving on to the ACS
crosshair six hero this is an AMD risin
motherboard and this has an r7 1700 in
it we tested with the following
configuration first we stock with CPB
auto performance by is disabled
note that asus calls the feature core
performance boost for AMD boards but as
core performance boost is to honda fit
in charge were calling at ctv we next
tested XMP with CPV auto and performance
by is disabled then XMP with CP be
disabled explicitly and performs by is
disabled finally XMP with CP be enabled
explicitly in CB 15 bias the results for
Cinebench are on the screen now with
core performance boost set to auto stock
settings without XMP and performance by
is disabled we've measured 1400 points
for multi-threaded 145 for single
threaded enabling XMP but leaving the
other options auto and disabled we
measured 14 32 points and 148 points
boosted from higher memory speeds
enabling XMP and explicitly disabling
core performance boost we measured leap
dot seven points multi-threaded or 123
for single threaded finally enabling
core performance boost and Cinebench
bias we measured 14 72 points
multi-threaded a substantial uplift and
151 points single threaded here are the
frequencies with core performance boost
enabled we ended up at 3154 multi or
28:15 single with a disabled we're at
3000 multi or 2662 single we always test
the core performance boost enabled on
AMD Rison platforms but it's not the
same as MCE
for AMD core performs boost seems to
trigger precision boost and xfr-s noted
previously which are both stock features
of AMD Rison by default and so it makes
sense that the motherboards enables CPB
by default this is a different feature
from Intel CPUs and how they interact
with mze
we do however leave the biases off as
those are motherboard one-offs power
does exit spec as defined by TDP but
remember that TDP is not equivalent to
actual power consumption well you know
this power chart what we see is that we
measured about sixty eight point seven
watts close to the 65 watt TDP again not
really the same thing but either way and
26 watts for single threaded this was
with CP be disabled with CP be enabled
the default
option measured seventy nine watts multi
thirty-three watt single and just a
quick recap for TDP its more measure of
how much cooling power not really the
best word but how much cooling prowess
we'll call it is required to keep a
sieve you within spec as opposed to how
much power is drawn so the two numbers
are not technically the same however
they are very close tends to be the case
that TDP is within single digit
percentages of the actual power
consumption so recapping here why does
it happen
motherboard vendors are competing to try
and keep up with each other some of them
have in the past enabled MCE by default
they're probably some boards out there
that still do it but we haven't run into
any yet and on the motherboard vendor
side it's just not wanting to look bad
in comparison so everyone needs to kind
of make sure that MC stays off it's
really on us because what happens is
once a motherboard vendor enables MCE by
default as gigabyte did with bios
version f2 before they later changed it
and thank you gigabyte for doing that
what happens is other vendors will see
those results freaked out about why
their performance looks bad when all
they do is make a mother all they do
quotes make a motherboard and then
enable MCE on their own so that's kind
of the concern here it's not an Intel
hidden secret narrative it's not Intel
trying to control the motherboard makers
its motherboard makers independently
competing with one another so and
ultimately executives at the top looking
and seeing their boards lower on the
charts and not understanding why for
future testing for our own testing we're
going to standardize a couple of new
procedures to ensure that motherboards
and manufacturers aren't unintentionally
or intentionally pulling one over on us
so a couple things here one we're going
to begin taking note and detail in which
efi version we use for the CPU and
motherboard in the review we tend to do
this internally but it's probably a good
time to start putting that external for
validation reasons and because really
the the BIOS makes a huge impact on
performance so that's an important thing
we now believe that it's basically just
as important as listen what GPU we use
so we're gonna start putting that in the
test tables which will help isolate
problems in the future that our BIOS
related to going to begin exporting the
BIOS when possible and saving it
somewhere so that we can ensure we have
permanent access to pre-production BIOS
revisions
because the review BIOS is important to
keep around because we need to see if
they did anything tricky or different or
weird in that BIOS and make sure we have
for later
fortunately we still had all the old
biases from previous flashes but we're
gonna save them internally explicitly
now to make sure of that for all future
biases as well and three we usually
conduct a fully automated test suite
from synthetics and production workloads
including blender we'll keep doing that
because it is a slightly accurate you
can repeat stuff really easily but we're
also now adding in some additional
hardware info logging so this is going
to be a separate run as stated
previously hardware info can impact
performance results we are not going to
be including hardware info for the test
pass used in the results averaging but
we're going to be using them to average
or to validate rather CPU frequencies
voltages and cache memory behaviors
things like that which will just be a
completely separate isolated run to give
us a bunch of data that we can then
crawl through validate make sure
everything is performing to spec and not
doing anything tricky one more thing
we're gonna go back and correct some of
the old Cinebench charts on pov-ray that
use the gigabyte f2 bios and make sure
they're reflected with the new data
based on what we found here today so
that's I think that's about the deepest
dive you'll get on MCE so far for the
specific motherboards we're looking at
today we're gonna keep a close eye on
this for the B and H motherboards you
could assume coming soon based on the
weeks that have been out there and for
the rise in 2000 CPUs you could also
assume coming soon and we've got a
