luxury case but we're still gonna review
it so this is the coolermaster cosmos
C's 700 M and it's got pretty much every
trend you can imagine it has curved
tempered glass which has questionable
yield at times but is very cool and it
can be pulled off a RGB LEDs of course
can't not do that if you're in case
manufacturing 2018 it's got four fans
and we're gonna be focusing on overall
build quality thermal testing and noise
testing for the new coolermaster C 700 M
which is a reprisal of the cosmos series
that they've made for a long time now
for high-end builds and home servers
before that this video is brought to you
by power colors rx 588 gigabyte card
which is marked down to $200 with rebate
starting September 29th on new egg and
that is for the 8 gigabyte model if
you're looking for a mid-range video
card for gaming on high settings
consider power colors 8 gigabyte rx 580
that we linked below the card also comes
with three free games including
Assassin's Creed Odyssey star control
and Strange Brigade while supplies last
learn more at the link below we have a
lot of information to go through on this
case today and a lot of pretty cool
b-roll first of all it's large it's very
tall it's also have 51 pounds so it's a
good test case for our workers comp
policy and then we also did tests on
thermals it has an extra fan over the C
700p for instance and then the paneling
has been changed to now use curves on
both sides of the tempered glass rather
than the fokker v' in the original c
700p which that by the way that curve is
very expensive to do the yields are
pretty low on it so it's very much a
high-end case it's very much a home
server showoff type of case maybe not in
the budget
of most people in our audience but halo
products are still fun to go over
because a lot of these things can come
down later to cheaper products that are
more mainstream now just like the C 700
P the case is invertible so you can flip
it all around you can rotate it stuff
like that there are extra panels to
block off the back if it ends up not
being used for i/o it's very
customizable it's kind of a pain still
to do that customization but we're not
really a hundred
how to make that process perfect because
no matter what you do there gonna be a
lot of screws if the goal of the case is
to allow literally everything to move so
probably not the most user-friendly
feature but if you really want to change
the orientation of the case you can do
it and hopefully you're only doing it
one time that's one of the main features
of the cosmos line that's started with
the c7 or P and other than that it's
tempered glass it's a RGB it's got the
cosmos sort of handles that they've
always had and they're known for and
then a decent amount of fans got for
stock all 140s and then a lot of room
inside for Cale management for video
cards and different orientations things
like that so enough of that let's get
into Patrick's build notes and then the
thermals and testing the C 700 P and C
700 M have a few differences from each
other first is the front panel which we
criticized in the original C 700 P
review in the older model there was a
thin plastic shell that almost
completely covered a overall a nice mesh
front for no good reason the shell could
be hinged outwards to access an optical
drive or the front filter but leaving it
open or taking it off permanently would
look weird the situation is similar here
but the plastic shell is narrower and
has strips of ventilation on either side
more importantly it can be completely
taken off and still look natural I'll be
it with fewer LEDs this and the dark
base pro 900 may be the only cases we
reviewed we're removing part of the
front panel is something that a user
might actually do rather than something
we just do to test and prove a point the
bottom and front filters are sheets of
stiff perforated metal backed by a thick
plastic reinforcement the bottom filter
pulls forward which is the better way to
do it so you don't have to move the case
round away from the wall the top filter
is more conventional and uses a light
mesh sandwiched between layers of metal
and plastic and the decorative metal
layer may prove restrictive the top
mounted radiators especially towards the
back of the case where there are fewer
holes both the front and the top of the
case contain large easily removable fan
mounts as well which we found to be
well-built
the built-in lighting is about as good
as it gets for a RGB LEDs
lit strips around the edges of the case
are divided into sections of three so
there's top front and bottom for
lighting there's no internal lighting
but the external lighting bounces off
the inside of the top and bottom rails
each section is plugged into cooler
masters combined fan and led controller
PCB there's decent amount of baked in
colors and patterns that don't require
external control but there's a header to
accept motherboard control as well fans
can be set to high medium low or
motherboard control but as usual we
plugged all fans directly into the
motherboard for testing the LEDs in the
front panel are connected via some gold
pins at the bottom that automatically
plug in and disconnect with the panel's
removal which we've actually prefer two
cables that get torn out our one
complaint is that the front panel
controls for the fans and LEDs are a
little bit confusing
each is controlled with a pair of plus
and minus buttons but each pair is
covered by a single shell which is
marked in three places these status is
indicated by multiple LEDs that aren't
all labeled clearly it's easy to operate
but it could be more intuitive the rest
of the front panel i/o consists of four
USB 3.0 ports a USB C port a dedicated
mic jack and a 2.5 millimeter combined
headphone and mic jack we rarely see
this many USB 3 connections on a case
despite many motherboards having headers
to support them
the combined headphone and mic jack is
also a rarity but it makes sense given
how common earbuds with integrated
microphones have become the side panels
hinge outwards enough to allow working
on the internals easily but they also
lift up and off the hinges pretty easily
too
they don't need screws like most of the
other cases they're held in by magnets
placed at the front edge of the panel
which could be a problem for kale
management if there weren't already so
much room for cables the single glass
panel is curved at both the front and
back edges which is an impressive
technical achievement because yields on
curved glass panels are pretty low and
something coolermaster has been working
towards frankly the faux double curve
and the seesaw 100p looks just as good
but it's understandable that cm is
pulling out all the stops for the C 700
app despite this they've resisted the
urge to brand any part of the case other
than the overall design the closest
thing to a
Master logo is the hexagonal start
button and that's about it
taking a moment to be really picky here
there are a few pieces of the plastic
trim that don't fit flush and this isn't
something that would be worth calling
out on less expensive cases we review
but there shouldn't be any panel gaps
pretty much whatsoever in a $440
enclosure at least not highly visible
ones the front panel and the plastic
ring that hides the door hinges are the
only parts that exhibit this flaw like
the seat 700p this is an invertible case
it's a cool feature it adds some
interesting options for showing off case
internals it changes the thermals a bit
but the quote chimney effect where the
stack effect isn't as effective in pc
cases as just using fans to direct air
wherever you want it's still a massive
hassle to invert the case or rotate it
but it's a cool idea and good that it's
possible we did this previously with
cooler masters see 700 P and found it to
be overall irritating to rearrange but
definitely doable and you're probably
only doing it once anyway the vertical
GPU mount is much more versatile here
than in other cases we've seen it's
actually a big hinge to support that
attaches to the PSU shroud and can be
folded flat so that the card lines up
against the shroud you could also fold
it partially to put the card at an angle
our card is a little too wide for that
overall it's not a reference PCB but
there's still plenty of room to mount it
vertically which there often isn't if
there's anything that the C 700 has
plenty of though its space and that also
aids in GPU thermals which we'll talk
about more later as for the riser cable
that's applied that's 400 millimeters
long which is long enough to allow
putting the card pretty much anywhere
inside of the case including with the
inversion or rotation options getting to
the thermal section now we did all the
testing with four stock fans in their
default positions so three front intake
one rear exhaust and those are plugged
into the motherboard and set to full
speed we didn't do any testing of the
inverted or chimney layout this time but
again let us know if that's something
you want additional tests were done
without the front panel covering without
any panel whatsoever and using the GPU
Mountain vertically with the GPU in the
standard orientation in the case as well
well start first a standalone seat 700
testing and then moved to comparative
data CBO temperature during the torture
test averaged 61 degrees Celsius over
ambient and the stock configuration
temperatures improved drastically
without the front panel cover and the
new average was 51 point seven degrees
over ambient a rough 10 degree
improvement from baseline the cover
expectedly chokes almost all potential
airflow through the front of the case
and the strips of ventilation that are
left are covered in an extra layer of
decorative mesh this raises an
interesting point the front panel shell
has no unfiltered gaps so the internal
filter is pointless unless the shell is
removed users should opt to use one or
the other the internal filter or the
shell but not both we prefer using just
the internal filter here which wasn't
that much warmer than the forty seven
point nine degree temperature from using
no front panel at all the vertical GPU
test also kept the CPU surprisingly cool
but we'll discuss that test more in the
GPU section this is partly because we
reduce Edin radiative heat off the
backside of the GPU and changing where
the GPU is exhausting its Heat see 700
mm stock temperature measured warmer
than we saw in the C 700 P but removing
the front panel entirely from each
resulted in equivalent thermal
performance with in error anyway the
frame is overall unchanged it's just the
front panel and the filter have received
those heavy modifications comparatively
none of the other cases on the full
chart really compete in the $400 price
class it's just this is one of the few
we reviewed at this price
assuming a 61-degree standard
temperature for a stock it's really not
impressive and toward the bottom of the
chart assuming a 51 degrees standard
temperature with the cover removed which
still looks like a normal case mind you
the case does very well overall it lands
about where the 1/2 X is in that
instance and that's a decent spot to be
for something that's not trying to be
the most airflow intensive case ever GPU
torture temperature averaged 48 point 3
degrees Celsius over ambient and
improved by a couple degrees with this
front panel completely removed the only
result that differed vastly from the
others was the vertical GPU test which
averaged 69.6 degrees at DT and it
throttled down to just under 700
megahertz to limit thermals as opposed
to about 1780 megahertz for the standard
torture test mind you this is with a
power virus not a gaming at workload so
the point here is that the clocks will
be enumerated
currently by the application the main
reason the CBO temperature was so much
cooler with the GPU vertical is probably
because of the airflow change moving the
GPU to the vertical position puts its
fans out of the airflow path of the
front fans it's stealing less of the
front air and then instead of sitting
horizontally where it's radiating heat
into the middle of the fin stack for the
CPU it's sitting vertically with a giant
gap behind it so that hot air has got
somewhere else to sit that shouldn't
influence the Seaview intake quite as
much moving on to the comparative chart
the seats have 100mm is forty eight
point three degree result is one of the
best GB results we've seen which is why
there was so little improvement when the
front panel was removed the number of
intake fans combined with the width and
general size of the case means that the
GPU supplied plenty of cool air and is
able to exhaust as much hot air as it
wants really one of the few cases that
did better was the original C 700 P at
forty three point three degrees Celsius
delta T over ambient but that was only
when its front panel and filter were
removed the C 700 M placed forty six
point five degrees in the same
configuration which is more or less
equivalent 3dmark fire strike extreme
testing raised the GPU temperature
slightly higher than the torture tests
of fifty point three degrees Celsius
delta theory' ambient that's great
compared to the other cases on the chart
equalling the silverstone raven rb0 to
in performance the seat 700 m repeatedly
does well for GPU temperature the
blender cpu ran to raise the cpu
temperature to 40 degrees celsius around
the level of the fractal Mushaf i and
defined c cases neither of which ship
with as many fans as we'd like them to
they have to 120s the stock see 700 p
man is 38.3 degrees celsius in
comparison and GPU temperature in the
render workload was twenty four point
one degrees celsius within margin of
error of the top three results the dark
based pro 900 revision to the PMO one
and a half acts to see 700 P average 27
degrees in the same test definitely not
as impressive noise is up next forty
point one DBA marks the C 700 M a bit
louder than the C 700 PE but not
significantly so even though the C 700 M
has an additional fan taking the front
panel cover off with the fans still at
full speed raised our noise reading to
forty two point three DBA one of the
noisy results on the chart
but it's understandable if this proves
anything is that the front panel shall
at least does a decent job at muffling
some of the fan noise talk--i then is it
worth it and getting into the conclusion
let's let's start off on a real note
here a $440 case for most people is not
going to be worth it let's just get that
out of the way that's not to say the
case is bad don't get us wrong there but
440 bucks is a video card it's a lot of
memory it's a high-end CPU so of course
you all know this this is a luxury item
if you have a lot of money and you are
already building high-end pcs you just
one of those people who just you're okay
with spending it if it gets you what you
want because you have the money then
it's worth considering but only then
because otherwise there's still plenty
of cases made by Coolermaster and other
people into your price brackets this is
very much what is known as a halo
product it is meant to get eyes on the
Coolermaster brand and then if someone
really likes the case but they can't
afford it or justify the expense look at
other Coolermaster cases that perhaps
they can't afford it's a common tactic
everyone does it Corsair does it with
their obsidian series for example so
this is a halo product and if you are
into the idea of Coolermaster after
seeing the case although of course we
never recommend following a specific
brand just follow the products instead
but if you really like what you see
still the age 500 mesh or H 500 P mesh
as it were is one of the best cases they
make right now a very good case the H
500 non P and on M non mesh just
straight age 500 also pretty good in the
budget class but this case doing over
the key points here so it's got plenty
of room for stuff it's not you can do
water cooling with it just fine you can
do pretty much whatever you want with it
just fine there are better cases if you
want to go all out like the SM 800 for
example the case labs case but case labs
is now gone so good luck getting one of
those so the case though the GPU cooling
is way better than we expected so kudos
to Coolermaster that vertical GPU : not
good with an air-cooled card don't put
an air-cooled card in there if it's
gonna be vertical against the glass go
with a liquid cooled card instead that's
kind
beating at that horse at this point and
then the performance overall
so for CPU cooling and cooling in
general we still recommend just going
with this case is too big I can't do it
so we would recommend removing probably
this or the filter but don't leave both
in because there's really no point in
having two layers of dust filtration on
there just gonna suffocate the airflow
this will catch dust just fine it's a
pretty fine mesh and you don't need the
other one and performance will improve
quite a bit as we saw so there's plenty
of room here for decent performance
stock out of the box it's really not
that good but you remove that panel it's
pretty damn good or if you want the
panel because you want the RGB LEDs
because that is let's face it half the
selling point of the case then you just
take out the filter in there and you
leave that in there and you're still
doing okay so that's that's our
recommendation if you are going to
actually buy the case build quality is
fine it's decent overall as a product
it's very expensive if we're being
honest it is of course for most people
not even close to justifiable but
Coolermaster I'm sure knows this it's
it's it's a video card how you buy a
Vega 64-56 GTX 970 TI something like
that with that kind of money they know
it so yeah it's not for everyone but
overall the products it's fine it's
certainly a much better launch than the
age 500 P original launch and it does
incorporate a lot of the criticisms that
people had of the c7 RP and the age 500
PE original case so good to see that
progress as well we actually liked the C
700 P original case a decent amount it
wasn't wasn't our favorite but we liked
it more than H 500 peerage '''l case
because the invertible feature is very
interesting if not mainstream it's not
something everyone wants but it's cool
to have a product that does something
that is different than just being a box
you put stuff and sometimes as long as
it can still breathe and the see some
hard series has always been ok with it
as long as you can kind of work with the
filters they give you and cut it down
like the example that I just gave right
here so overall that's the C 700 M as a
