we've completely overhauled our CPU
testing methodology for 2019 and this is
what we'll be using for the rest of the
year new testing includes more games
than before tested at two resolutions
alongside workstation benchmarks these
are new for us we've added a couple of
workstation workloads that we hadn't
looked at before like program compile
we've added Adobe Premiere Adobe
Photoshop compression and decompression
v-ray and more today is the unveiling of
the workstation half of our new testing
methodology with the games getting
unveiled separately we're starting with
a small list of popular CPUs and we'll
add more as we go before that this video
is brought to you by the gigabyte ARS ad
27 QT gaming monitor the ad 27 QT is a
27-inch 1440p gaming display with 95% of
dcpip 3 color saturation for high color
accuracy accompanied by a 1 millisecond
response time 10 bit IPS panel and
display HDR visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs for
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles
and adaptive and noise reduction learn
more at the link below so this is just a
preview of something we've been working
on for a couple of months now just
building out the tests validating them
making sure we're happy with how the
performance looks and happy with the
different aspects of the CPU that the
tests represent typically we do a couple
of games and then we do maybe one or two
workstation
benchmarks like blender for example
software that we actually use and is
used widely for 3d animation 3d
rendering and 3d art so that's been our
staple workstation benchmark but there's
a lot more to workstation performance
than blender which is primarily
representative of the high thread-count
CPUs and doesn't really look at other
aspects of the processor this set of
charts is not a hundred percent complete
yet so it's it's an unveil of the new
methodology we'll have more information
in the article in the description below
if you want to read the full testing
methods that will describe them there
and what we're going through today is
the workstation stuff so that'll be
blender the anew compiler compress
collection for those of you who've
wanted programming or compiling
benchmark
from us we now have a GCC for that we
have v-ray we have Adobe Premiere Adobe
Photoshop and then 7-zip for compression
and decompression for games going
forward not in this video but in a
future one coming up soon we have hitman
2 which is new for us
we have Assassin's Creed origins one of
our staples from previously GTA 5 total
war Warhammer to the battle mode total
war Warhammer to campaign mode
civilization 6 tested just at one
resolution because the turn time
benchmark Shadow the Tomb Raider and an
f1 2018 which leaves us with 15 total
test combinations for just games alone
because it's 1080p 1440p across all
those games and then six is just 1080p
so that's our new benchmark suite it is
very comprehensive we're pretty happy
with the amount of data we end up with
but we think that it's still an actually
usable amount it's not overwhelming and
it doesn't just become a huge mess of
charts but what we're going to have to
do is kind of split them because
otherwise it will be a huge mess of
charts so work stations what we're
looking at today we don't have the HTTP
Intel CPUs benchmarks or revenge marks
yet you can still look at our old tests
like the 3175 x to see how some of those
did but today we're starting with
popular cpus and then we also threw and
thread refer just because we had one
around for other testing so let's get
into it
we'll look at work station results you
can check the article below for more
information and then we'll talk
conclusions after all the benchmarks we
had a lot of requests to add compiler
benchmarks to our test suite so we
finally did for this we've added the GCC
benchmark which involves compiling the
ganoush Empire collection version 8
point 2.0 with GCC version 7 point 4.0
we set a flag to allow it to spawn as
many threads as possible so the
compilation process involves both some
single threaded and heavily
multi-threaded workloads interestingly
the results for this test are the
inverse of many of the gaming tests that
we'll publish next with all the AMD
chips on the table and all the Intel
chips at the bottom the 2990 WX with
Corp Ryo enabled logged the fastest time
and an 11% time reduction versus the
stock 2990 WX the AMD chips below
this are ordered predictably the 4.2
gigahertz 16 thread 2700 is at top
allowing the 2990 wxa time reduction of
about half with the r5 2600 at 4.2
gigahertz following the 2700 next this
stack shows that frequency still matters
as it outpaces the 2700 ex stock CPU
marginally the are 727 100 X is 8 point
7 minute compile-time leads the 9900
case stock CPU by 22% a meaningful
improvement overall the 9900 K leads the
Intel CPUs and again the order is
predictable other than the AMD Intel
divide the CPS are logically ordered by
the highest frequency and core count
parts with the stock 8600 K at the very
bottom frequency and core count are
important factors but they aren't
everything and this is one real-world
workload that shows it cache for
instance can also come into play in this
type of benchmark note that other
compilers may behave differently and
also that Lincoln is a factor worthy of
consideration if using linkers that are
typically single threaded this can pose
a bottleneck we are also doing all of
our testing and Windows and so Linux
workloads would further exhibit
deviation from what we're seeing here
7-zip is next 7-zip includes a built-in
benchmark that can generate scores for
both compression and decompression
measured in millions of instructions per
second interestingly decompression
appears to be more thread dependent than
compression the 9900 K leads in
compression by a good margin with 21.4
present more instructions per second
than the 9700 K when both are
overclocked this shows that threads that
still do affect the score even though
this chart lines up differently than the
decompression chart we'll look at next
the worst performer in this category is
the stock I 580 600 k with only 6 cores
and 6 threats but the 32 core 64 thread
2990 WX only lands in the middle of the
charge we seem to be constrained to some
extent by single threaded performance in
decompression however threader parterres
ahead of everything else was 115 percent
more instructions per second than the
overclocked 9900 k the stock AMD r7
2,700 x and overclocked r7 2700 actually
managed to beat out these stock 9900 K
although overclock into 5.2 gigahertz
does allow it to regain the lead
at the expense of power the 2700 out
performs at the overclock 290 700 K at
5.1 gigahertz from the 2700 is stock
illustrating a limitation in the i7
thread count as the r7 gains a 5% lead
even the r5 2600 at 4.2 gigahertz it
nearly keeps up with least at 9700 K
we're next using Puget systems at
Photoshop benchmark it recommends 32
gigabytes of system memory which is the
main reason we now use 4 8 gigabyte
sticks of RAM for all of our tests
rather than just 4 CPUs that can run
memory in quad-channel
we run the extended version of this
benchmark which produces seven scores as
well as an overall score to summarize
them thread count isn't much help here
and the 5.2 gigahertz at 9900 K it tops
the chart once again the chart is
roughly ordered by CPU frequency with
the 2990 WX scoring slightly worse than
the stock r5 2600 even with game mode or
Corp Ryo the ordering up by frequency is
further illustrated by the 80 600 K at 5
gigahertz outperforming a stock 8700 K
or the 9700 K at 5.1 gigahertz
outperforming the stock at 9900 K
Photoshop appears to be frequency bound
in these tests which includes the
application of various filters
transforms resizes photo merges and more
and if you're curious about the intel h
EDT cpus we first started using this
benchmark back in the 7900 era including
most recently with the 3175 ax blunder
benchmarking has also changed with this
round of GM's updated test methodology
we're keeping our in-house made
benchmark scenes using realistic
workloads with things like ray tracing
and movie ready render settings also
realistic effect but we've eliminated
blender 2.78 2.78 has grown long in the
tooth so we've struck out that monkey
had rendered test and the temperamental
2.79 splash render as well as been
removed leaving only the blender 2.79
monkey head render and the GN logo
renders the monkey heads produce a
varied work load on the CPU exclusively
by using different types of textures
transparencies and elements within the
scene while the GM logo how is the CPU
more explicitly with ray tracing and
very very high sample count
for the final render it's typically the
test that causes unstable overclocks
to reveal themselves as unstable blender
is an important test to us because we
actually use it and it directly benefits
us to know which CPUs handle it best
let's start with the monkeyhead render
the 2990 WX takes this test handily with
its 64 threads and the rest of the stack
lines up in a similar fashion to the
other thread bound workloads with the
9700 K being the only CPU breaking the
more cores higher score pattern the 2990
WX finished testing in ten point nine
minutes stock roughly the same with Corp
Rio and demonstrates clear value to
professionals who work in tile based
rendering applications like blender and
cycles the biggest value add is when
high system memory requirements exist as
this can rapidly exit the confines of
GPU memory allotment thus limiting
usefulness of CUDA rendering we still
need to retest our h EDT Intel CPUs so
thread Ripper remains relatively
isolated for now the 9900 K at stock
completes its render in twenty point six
minutes a time reduction of 11% from the
stock r7 2,700 ax is 23 minute render
time the 2,700 X comes close given the
price difference and that's because
blender tends to favor thread count
since it spawns one tile per thread for
the G M logo render the TR 2990 W X
obviously still leads and we'll wait
until further updates to the chart
before it has any company the 9900 k
stock CPU roughly equates an overclocked
2700 at 4.2 gigahertz
although outperforms the stock 2700 X
with a 6% render time reduction the
stock 2700 and stock 9700 k also end up
roughly tied with the 8700 k approaching
both of these CPUs and performance
premier is a test that we've done in the
past but we haven't kept up with it
faithfully due to the amount of manual
setup required this is something that
we've resolved going forward our last
Adobe premier test was with our old test
methodology where we showed the Intel 28
court
31 75 X proven genuinely good when
overclocked
it drew a hell of a lot of power but it
also managed the fastest render times
even outperforming the 99 ATX II and the
high speed 9900 K we haven't retested
with our new test suite just yet but we
do have more mainstream CPUs test
for today we've streamlined at this
process and now we're rendering three
videos one at 1080p60 it's a convention
show floor report one at 4k 60 with a
roll and b-roll and one 4k video
consisting entirely of charts h.264 is
our codec for these for now with a high
profile and 35 megabit per second output
starting with the 1080p 60 a roll and
b-roll footage from a convention where
we use clips entirely off of our
Panasonic UX 180 and recorded through
our zoom audio devices we get the chart
on the screen now we haven't yet put the
h EDT cpus through this one so the 99
100 K is 3.9 minute render is at the top
render times reduced by nearly 8 percent
with an overclocked to 5.1 gigahertz the
9700 K at 5.1 gigahertz shows that
despite being at frequency locked with
our chart-topping 9900 K the extra
threads are actually beginning to help
more as Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019 gets
updates but I knew I had heard K a 5.1
gigahertz holds a lead of 15 percent
over the 9700 k advantaged by its double
thread count and these are 7 2700 at 4.2
gigahertz and the 2700 X finished the
rendering about 4.4 to 4.5 five minutes
and in roughly equal to the stock 9700 K
despite increasing thread utilization
premier still likes higher frequencies
this much is proven by comparing the
2700 stock result of five point two
minutes to the OC result where we see a
reduction of 13 percent versus baseline
the r5 2600 at 4.2 gigahertz does
exceptionally well when considering its
more budget oriented positioning
although professionals who use premiere
every single day would still want to
consider a higher-end option toward the
top of the chart or something we haven't
yet tested our 4k 68 roll and b-roll
render was more intensive clearly as
it's dealing with a higher quality
output and more pixels the 9900 KOC
finishes this rendered in 10.8 minutes
which is a render time reduction of 10%
from baseline this stack is almost
exactly the same for these tests except
B 2700 stock and the 8700 K reshuffle
but they're within error margins of each
other in both tests the difference
between the 2700 X and a 900 K both
stock is that the 9900 K finished as a
trend
in 13% last time the chart render in
particular seems to be a lighter
workload on the CPU and we'll be
scrapping it moving forward this is an
illustration of a workload that isn't as
heavily reliant upon the CPU how do we
see CUDA kicking in to help more
frequently with our chart renders that
be what you're seeing on the screen now
it's it's a chart render because that's
well that's the idea of what we're doing
for the 4k 60 chart render test it's a
lot of this but anyway because of how
scattered these results are especially
with how unreliable the differences are
and how some of these just straight up
don't make a lot of sense
we have to scrap it going forward
because the test data is not reliable
and because we're exiting cpu-bound
scenarios and entering scenarios where
other parts of the system are taking
more control chaos groups v-ray
benchmark includes a GPU and a CPU test
but we use the CPU test only for this
benchmark it takes between one and two
minutes to complete on most of our CPUs
and the results align closely with
something like Cinebench or blender for
rendering benchmarks with the higher
thread count CPUs like the 2990 WX and
the 9900 K heavily advantaged leaving
the stock 8600 K and that lasts until we
retest our h EDT Intel CPUs the 9900 K
at five point two gigahertz is Intel's
highest results on our chart this one
completes the workload in 0.95 minutes
allowing the 2990 WX a time reduction of
about 52 percent demonstrating that the
array actually leverages the threads
available to it although the 9900 K does
well to keep up with an h EDT part extra
threads do went out in this test
ultimately the 2700 at 4.2 gigahertz
outperforms the overclocked at 9700 K
demonstrating again that there's a
thread advantage but it's barely beaten
by the 9900 case stock CPU price is a
factor granted and the 2700 comes in
about 265 dollars cheaper the r5 2600
just for reference at 4.2 gigahertz
lands at 1.5 three minutes time
completion putting it within range of
the 8700 K a stock CPU so that's it for
our new workstation tasks we technically
also have Cinebench just for internal
validation we we don't really publish
those numbers because we have blender
for an actual workload for that but we
still take it just to make sure the
CPUs are where they should be for
internal validation of performance we
have thai-inspired that we didn't show
in this video perhaps in the future
though and then the really interesting
stuff is GCC v-ray stuff like that if
you have specific requests of things
that you would still like to see leave
them below there's no guarantee we'll
add them into this test suite but we do
actively take suggestions these tests
were advanced because of suggestions
from our audience so if you want to be
considered even if it's in six months
from now for additional testing leave
your idea below and maybe a brief reason
of why you would like to see that even
if it's just look I'm a professional in
this space and we use this application
we'll certainly consider it so there's
obviously a lot more that can be done
but this is the most comprehensive suite
we've ever had for CPU testing and we
are greatly looking forward to
continuing to use this suite advancing
it and figuring out what new things it
teaches us about processor performance
so for now you get a recap of the 99
hundred K of the 2700 series X and non X
the overclocked performance for some of
those and try to represent a couple of
those charts as well and then we'll
we'll continue advancing as rise and
3000 series comes out and up until then
so let us know what you think of the
suite it's fairly comprehensive but
again open to suggestions subscribe for
more go to store documents nexus dotnet
to support us directly for this type of
multi month effort and you can pick up
something like for example our GN
teardown cubes which have a 3d laser
engraved logo GM logo with things like
MOSFETs capacitors inductors and a fake
V RMS probably can't turn that into a
real one but you could try subscribe for
more I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
