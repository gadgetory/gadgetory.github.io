already have plenty of news items to
discuss for the weekly news to round up
as it were the first one on the agenda
is an AMD and NVIDIA sort of rivalry as
you might expect between them this is
something that happens a lot where one
of them will try and smoke the other one
for coverage and for spectacle in the
industry and for now this is having next
week on the twenty-eighth februari 28
where andy will be hosting its capsaicin
events which seems becoming an annual
thing for the RTG group or Radeon
technologies the graphics group and then
video will be hosting what it's calling
a geforce gtx gaming celebration what
exactly that entails we do not yet know
it could be the usual battleship or
aircraft carrier celebration that
they've done in the past which seems
certainly bombastic or it could actually
be some kind of product announcement
which would certainly be more
interesting to all of us so we're not
sure what that is just yet but it will
be held on the same day as capsaicin and
this is really just more of an
interesting thing to look at in the
industry where one of the two caught
wind of what the other was doing and now
it's their event and started sending out
invites so I'm not sure who came up with
their event first but it is not uncommon
for the other vendor to then step in to
their own event and fight for coverage
so kind of interesting in that regard
this is also something we see what's
product launches where especially online
video side and this is maybe some topic
for our Sunday videos in the future but
we're nvidia even with kv lake just so
happened to announce their intensity
intensity TI laptops on the same day
with and these announcements they tend
to announce pains the next day the same
day so it's a very interesting cycle of
competing with one another for news so
februari 28 set your calendars for that
we will be out in the area san francisco
area actually we're here right now as
well we'll be at the events covering
them so you'll be able to find that
coverage as always on gamers nexus
thought net there are 48 total a ID
partners or add in board partners the
vendors who make the graphics cards and
according to jon peddie research which
usual grain of salt
with their findings but according to JP
are the GPU sales AIB sales specifically
increased for quarter for of 2016 jpr
says the AIB shipments peaked in 1999
with 114 million units and for
perspective in 2015 we saw just 44
million units ship again according to JP
our quarter 4 2016 showed a five to six
percent growth and AIB sales partly due
to the expected holiday buying but it
was also above the average growth rate
for the last few years according to the
report AIB shipments in the fourth
quarter of 2015 vs 4th quarter of 2016
year-over-year posted a growth of
thirty-six percent so a total of
forty-six percent total attach rate of a
i beez to systems the all-time high was
sixty-three percent in quarter one 2008
but I GPS and other market factors have
eaten away at that attach rate for a i
beez to the complete system market
trends that show Andy drawing from
twenty one point six percent in the
previous year in terms of total market
share of graphics cards sold to twenty
nine point five percent in the fourth
quarter of 2016 with NVIDIA of course
taking over the remaining seventy
percent or so it's a bit late in the
game now for the RX for 60 but msi has
got two new ones and out they are two
gigabyte and four gigabyte models both
of the 896 core variants not the new
expanded variants of the 460 and the
only interesting factor here is that
they are half pipe models so these are
smaller form factor RX 460 video cards
that are intended of course for use and
things like SSS pcs or HCPCS a growing
market right now the units are 1090
megahertz at base clock twelve hundred
megahertz boost clock again 896 cores
and I guess the only other metric of
note or spec of note is that they are
DVI and HDMI there's no display port on
these but they're half height so you
don't have a whole lot of room for those
IO options anyway Gabe Newell says that
valve remains optimistic about VR but it
is quotes pretty comfortable with the
idea that VR will turn out to be a
complete failure this is following that
some controversy over the fact that
there are no public sales figures for
really any VR device
oculus or valve in particular which are
of course these two main ones that we're
looking at for the gaming market and the
PC space the HTC vive has really only
rumored figures out about 140,000 total
units shipped with nothing official to
back that up if it turns out to be true
that there are lower sales than expected
which is probably a safe bet because if
they were really I you would certainly
hear valve or anyone else bragging about
it to no end but if it turns out to be
true that their lower volume the most
likely reasons for that would probably
be one cost especially for the vibe a
setup space requirements for the vibe or
the risk with the new touch controllers
and of course it's just a new thing and
whenever you have a new same it's not
going to be an easy time entering the
market particularly when there's a high
startup cost to buy it as a user and a
high investment cost for your pc there's
not a huge amount of content out there
there is a lot of great VR content but
work work with me here vr enthusiasts
you know I'm talking about there's a
long way to go before developers really
crack the new formula for how to build
games in this format so valve is hedging
their bets and saying that they're okay
with it either way psychology as a show
of good faith is extending its warranty
by one year on the ds4 15 plus vs 15 15
plus which we actually have this does
interests us the GS 18 15 + + 2 for 15
plus and then some RS units as well the
reason they're extending the warranty
again as a show of good faith is because
of the recent intel atom cpu defects or
errata issues anyway where the c25 38
cpu is showing some chance of
endangering data or just kind of
outright dying fine ology says that over
the last few years it has observed
analyzed all of its data for those units
that I just listed and has a term that
they are not at risk of data loss it has
determined that those units are within
their spec and their quality standards
and they don't really seem to think that
there is a need for any chaos runs in it
that said they're expanding the warranty
by one year so owners of the units
hopefully feel a bit more assured but
just be careful with your data for
type of raid sign ology or otherwise
that's on those Intel Atom cp's that are
affected so that is it for this news
roundup as always check back regularly
throughout the week for additional
coverage reviews things like that
traveling right now if that's not
obvious by the limited light setup but
we'll be back shortly and have more
reviews tear downs and things like that
