playing with the alpha cool ice wolf GPX
Pro this was sent to us by one of our
viewers and readers Eric so thank you
Eric for sending this in for tests so
this thing will go on the bench we're
doing a thermal bench with it this is
basically a liquid cooling mod for the
GTX 1080 at least the one that we have
there are different variants of this but
that's what was sent to us so we're
gonna be throwing that on to a founders
edition GTX 1080 which I've got here
already dismantled that will go on there
in the next video and final videos only
two parts will be testing the thermal so
a couple things to look out there one
will be the GPU core temperature hasn't
gone down probably two is I'm gonna be
looking at the mosfet temperatures so
I've got thermocouples on the card that
will be held by adhesive but before
getting to the build this is brought to
you by our patreon backers patreon.com
slash gamers Nexus will bring you to our
patreon page where you can help out with
future videos it like this one so let's
get into it the build basically a couple
things to keep in mind here one is we've
got the cooler to put on to I already
ran this through a bunch of tests with
an EVGA hybrid cooler so this is
basically the same as what we did with
our original 1080 hybrid build series
but I did update it gone through some
changes so this was thrown back on their
run through the bench that'll be in the
next video all that data and I did vlog
this time the vrm temps for one of the
MOSFETs in the center of the car that
would be the third counting from the
bottom up and then the PCB backplate
temperature just like we did for the
EVGA BRM thermals testing has been
logged on with GP core all that stuff so
after that we'll be testing this and
we'll be testing the ek version which
i've got prefilled water blocks for this
ek predator over here and that you can't
predator is a QDC system so it's got
quick-release setup for the tubing which
you can see here for the ice wolf as
well and these you basically just plug
them straight into whatever else is
compatible so we actually don't have to
do anything
in terms of open-loop setup you don't
need your own liquid so it's time to
install this basically the process is
pretty straightforward
the ice wolf comes with a really well
illustrated guide and it's got some
templates in there for cutting thermal
pads to size why they're not just
already cut the size I don't know but
some of them are some art and it's
probably just a cost thing so we've got
different thermal pads these come in a
purple or pink bag and they're smaller
these are 4 V Ram modules those come in
this bag if you buy one of those
yourself that's what you would use for
vram and these also come with them in
the same bag this is used for the rest
of the vrm so that would be some of the
FETs get those on them over on the right
side of the card and the voltage
converter power stages stuff like that
so we'll be doing that in a moment and
then the rest of the hardware couple of
obviously allen keys some allen screws
some larger allen screws three washers
that are used for the securing the
cooler to the card and larger screws so
the hard part of this has already been
done I've taken the old cooler off
you're not sure how to do that you can
check an article on our website just do
a search for gamers Nexus 1080 teardown
and it's pretty it's not necessarily
easy it's not hard if you're doing it
blind it's kind of hard though and you
can damage things but if you know what
you're doing and you have the steps in
front of you it's pretty simple it's
just a ton of screws to take out the
1080 is a bit more complex than the
other cards so that's the original
cooler you can see all the thermal pads
on it it actually works pretty damn well
the vrm thermals are not that hot on
this thing which is a bit impressive but
also it's not a complex be around so
let's go ahead and get started on this
our parts we've got other than all the
hardware the back plate here you want to
be careful not to get any contaminants
on the back plate or on the cold plate
for the card the back plate obviously
goes on the back of the PCB and then
we've also got the actual cooler which
is this thing so of course you have to
take this off and we'll just go ahead
and do that now so it's not gonna need
to be on there anymore
a little bit of a couple scratches on
the cold plate but there's your cold
blade nickel plated copper cold plate I
believe I've got the rest of the
heatsink here huge fins and then you're
gonna be pushing air through that just
through your normal case cooling it
should be basically aids silent cooling
because this is a full water block so
you've got full coverage with the water
block right here the pump and then
you're in and you're out valves so what
happens is this will call all the vram
and that's direct contact there's no
question about that
this touches we've what we have here we
have a nun dr. cut out here so this is
where the inductors or the chokes go if
you prefer then we've got points for the
capacitor bank here and for the vrm here
and for other components vrm components
PWM stuff like that over there so this
thing is full coverage the only place
that's not covered is the power header
but who cares about that so that's what
we've got to work with I have to first
install the thermal pads for the vram
and part of the vrm so to do this you
get your Barre card clean it off as
necessary first and in my case I'm
mounting some probes to this but that's
obviously not a step you'll normally do
so we get rid of all the plastic let's
put this on
so my process here is basically take one
of the pieces of plastic off and then
put it down and then take the other one
off and we're probably gonna have to
reseal or reposition a bunch of these
before the conclusion of putting the
block on the card but that's okay
okay so eight vram thermal pads that's
done that's taken care of you're gonna
want to recheck them all before closing
the thing up maybe do a surgeon's check
and count all the plastic - or just
throw it out as you go rather than leave
it on the table because you don't want
to get stuck on here so the next part we
have to cut these to size these larger
ones and we're gonna be putting a good
chunk of one of them right around here
actually maybe just like that even that
would be nice and then I've got captain
tape here don't worry about it it's not
conductive it's not really gonna be a
thermal issue not going to impact the
results and then the other one part of
it will go here which of course this
will all be smushed down by the actual
block so it's it's not it's gonna be
completely secured completely smashed
down won't go anywhere
and this even though it looks tall right
now because it's sticking up this is a
super thin thermocouple probe I've
talked about this and the EVGA video
it's not really going to impact the
transfer of heat so don't worry about
that but this pad the one that we're
cutting we are going to be cutting into
five parts it looks like total or at
least cutting one of them into four and
then the other one into the fifth part
so they have a template in here this is
actually really cool and I will praise
alpha cool for doing this on the ice
wolf
you've got your template here we're
gonna be cutting it into a looks like a
20 by 20 a 10 by 20 a 10 by 15 and a 5
by 10 those are our cuts for this thing
and I do have digital calipers but
because they've kind of got it marked I
don't know that I'll really use them or
need them and then the other one will
cut to this five size so let's let's go
ahead and start with the harder one so I
am going to mark it here mark it here
okay I think I need the box cutter
instead
box cutter works well for this
sweet okay yeah there's our five
okay those are ten by twenty an hour and
then we've got a 20 by 20 right there so
that'll cover most of our vrm we've got
to cut one more piece where'd it go
yeah there it is hey everyone
this one is a 20 by 30 this one's pretty
large which they have the guides on both
sides of this thing so now we're
covering the vrm components so number
five was the large cut that one is going
to be covering the top half of our
MOSFETs and if you look at the diagram
it basically comes up right in between
these two inductors so that's where
it'll be and that'll probably be a
little annoying for me to hold in place
while I get the rest of it on there but
it should be fine for anyone who is not
worried about thermocouples so that's
part of it and then that will be the
other part I want to make sure you're on
top of the MOSFETs so these little black
rectangle squares next to the inductors
this is an inductor
these are chokes those don't need to be
covered with thermal pads they are just
fine but make sure you cover those black
squares next to them not these these are
this that's the capacitor tank don't
worry about that just yet we're covering
those MOSFETs so that's where those go
and then our cut number four which is
the smallest one goes next to this tiny
capacitor over here and that covers okay
right there next to the capacitor and
then number three and number one which
one is larger number one is larger where
one goes up here the V R the vram vrm
and and this one will go over here next
to the inductor
then you want to leave breathing room
for thats cruel cuz we're gonna use that
later so that's where those will go I
want to sit here and apply these for a
minute and then we'll jump to the next
part alright so at this point it's time
to get the thermal paste on there this
is the thermal compound they provide
pretty big tube of it assuming it's
actually full we've got our own I'm not
sure what their thermal conductivity is
ours may be better than alpha cools but
we're gonna go ahead and use alpha cools
for now okay
GPUs by the way as I say all the time be
a little generous with the thermal
compound on them it's not the same as
the CPU or too much it's gonna impact
your your thermal contact there's no IHS
here so you want it to cover the
entirety of that surface with absolutely
no missing spots at all so it's better
to have a bit too much than I've been to
any amount too little so this is going
to go on just like this and on the
backside these couples do complicate
things a bit on the backside we're gonna
be using three screws to hold it in and
we also need to if you haven't already
peel off the thing that covers this
clean it if it's not clean if it's got
fingerprints on it and then it's time to
apply it I'm just gonna run my
thermocouple out at the bottom so I want
to make sure it's not crossing any
inductors or anything like that okay
they're just contact and kind of push it
down to secure it in place and secure
all of those thermal pads so that's what
we end up with now we need to start
sealing it okay so this part you need
three of the shorter Allen screws and
put the washer on them they've given us
tools already not the greatest in the
world but whatever
so three one two and three it's gonna be
the one right above the keen on the PCIe
slot then you skip the next one and then
the one in the middle of the card and
then the one at the top on the opposite
side okay that's gonna go okay contact
with the GPU vram contact for sure one
of the vram pads fell out that's
obnoxious probably means I don't have to
like reposition all those pads just give
me a second
only one of them moved it to moved
okay okay fine those are fine
please be magnetized damn it
that was good it's okay
backplate interesting I didn't have us
use all the screws one can definitely go
there okay alright call so we've got all
four of our screws in finally and now we
need to disperse the brown they're all
pads or orange as they declare on their
paper like one of these annoyingly has
to be cut the size as well so VRAM VRAM
VRAM VRAM VRAM VRAM VRAM gonna go one on
the back of each of these we're going to
put a blue dead center on the GPU which
I suppose I'll do last and this for the
record is really kind of unnecessary
this level of adhesive but in theory
it's gonna be one of the coolest cards
we could possibly make so let's go ahead
and go through with it
these don't have to be perfect pretty
low temperature part of the board next
we got to cut one of these up again and
there's our five okay large piece
there's a large large piece of gun right
where the thermocouple is so they want
these on the backside of MOSFETs which
makes sense and this top this large one
will basically align with the top to
vram thermal pads and it's gonna be next
to just inside of the border of these
two screws so you can kind of think
about it then the next largest one is
going and my orientation below that it's
going to be towards the PCIe slot again
really would be nice if I just did one
larger thermal pad but it's for cost
reasons so okay cool one more one more
pad two more pads just kidding okay so
this one goes right on the back of the
GPU center of the GPU it's a bit
stickier thankfully so it's easier to
work with and then the very last one
finally do is along with the memory VRM
which is going to be up here there's our
memory vrm pad okay final piece back
plate we need to line up the four large
screws with where we're securing the GPU
a pump so this will go just like that
I'm going to apply pressure to get
everything kind of situated and so it
doesn't move again okay so they've given
us some extras here which I know
normally sounds like you forgot a step
but that is not the case here we're
gonna end up with two extra I think two
extra maybe one extra large screw and
then it looks like one extra small screw
so as with any screw the roof the roll
here
a hand tight not gorilla tight or if you
prefer monkey tight like gorilla tight
these do not need to be crazy tight just
if it goes uneasily then great go until
it stops don't apply a whole bunch of
extra force because it's not necessary
all right cool so now that we've got it
closed up I'm gonna go ahead and look
down everywhere and make sure that no
thermal pads are loose in there and that
they've actually stuck to the services
and there's vram pads are all good every
single one of them is on a module so
nothing has moved there the back of the
GP is good back of the vram is good cool
so that's that's we call that a success
so there you have it there's the alpha
cool ice wall we're gonna put this an
assistant out and test it connect these
QT C's up as appropriate and I don't we
good to go
okay so that's our project that is the
Alpha cool ice wolf we'll be testing
this pretty soon it's normal for one to
two drops and water to leak from this as
it's connected to whatever solution
you're using well that's open loop or
otherwise and at that point it's time to
test it so should have results for you
in a couple of days and we'll be looking
at this versus the hybrid version that
we built versus the ekw B version for
which I have a prefilled water block so
