dotnet and today we are looking at
something I completely pulled apart this
is hey or was a GTX 750 zone by ZOTAC
this is a new passively cooled GTX 750
it is the 750 as we know it from Nvidia
with the GM 107 Maxwell chip on the
board as you can see right here where
the thermal paste sort of is was and
this is the cooler there's no fan so it
is a passive cooler and we we took it
apart looked at how it's built benchmark
the thermals benchmark the FPS and
that's what I've got for you here today
so in terms of how this is built its
it's pretty much like every other
heatsink for an actively cooled GPU
except it's got no fan so you have your
copper cold plate right here the copper
gold plate of course has thermal
interface or Tim or a thermal compound
or thermal paste between it and the GPU
which is on this board right here and
the GPU is the the part that really
generates heat so you put some thermal
compound on there and that ensures that
there's smooth contact between the
copper cold plate which is a 400 watts
per meter Kelvin thermal conductivity
rating and the GPU and if you don't have
that there are small imperfections in
the surface of the cold plate that will
catch and hold air and air is a lot
hotter than thermal paste which is about
seven watts per meter Kelvin air is like
not even one so you want that interface
in there otherwise you trap in and
generate heat in the form of air the
cold plate ducts all the heat away from
the GPU it then goes into the heat pipes
which I've explained this in depth in
the past and the article link to the
description below if you're interested
but we'll go over it briefly here heat
pipes have a sort of liquid in them that
goes through a phase change when heated
up and that's where you lose a lot of
your energy in the form of heat and that
liquid when it phase changes goes using
capillary action down the the heat pipe
eventually hits the tip condenses back
into a liquid and travels back to the
cold plate area it doesn't actually go
into the cold plate but it goes to the
cold plate area and then turns back into
a gas once heated up again and as the
heat pipe gets hotter your air nor
from a fan but not in this case your air
will blow through these aluminum fins
and duct the heat away from the fins
which are ducting the heat away from the
heat pipe so basically it's GPU
generates heat cold plate steels the
heat heat pipes steel that heat it
travels down them the aluminum fins
docked away from those heat pipes and
then air blows through the fins and
pulls away from the heat pipe so that
they can cool down the liquid and reuse
it for another pass in this case we're
relying on air from the case because
there is no fan so you do need some some
form of cooling in your case in order to
use this this video card is really
dedicated for use at the home theater
market so if you're a home theater PC
gamer if you're trying to build a dead
silent and I mean that because this
makes zero noise if you're trying to
build a dead silent home theater PC for
gaming in the living room that type of
thing and this is kind of where you want
to be headed in terms of passive devices
if you don't need the dead silence and
you could probably get a slightly better
GPU but we'll talk about that in a
moment in terms of thermal performance
let's see what we have here I benchmark
this with just a couple flagship cards
and one other Nvidia card that was
closer to the range so we've got the 750
passive GP running firm mark at 100%
load
cooled at twenty nine point eight
Celsius when under full load adjusted
for ambient that is actually very good
that's that's pretty pretty cool
considering there's no fan and for
reference we look at the 750 Ti on auto
settings which is the most realistic and
that was at thirty two point two Celsius
29 Celsius 30 Celsius is not bad at all
because your CP is probably gonna be
around that anyway if not a little
higher so and that's really all that
matters you want the GPU to not be
generating so much heat that it's
warming up all the surrounding
components so that's pretty good
performance just for reference the 750
Ti a 100% load with 24.7 Celsius the 250
X on auto which was a comparable priced
card was 47.2 Celsius quite a lot hotter
and it has active cooling on it but
that's Andy's architecture they run a
little bit hotter
moving on to FPS I tested this in
several games you can see all of them in
the links in the description below but
we'll just go through a few here really
quickly in this case the 750 passive
cards limit was about 27 FPS went on
very high with Metro last light which is
really good actually that means you can
probably play the game on a mix of low
and medium settings at around 60 fps
that's what I define as playable that's
what the site defines as playable is 60
FPS so you have to be lower medium for
metro which isn't amazing but really not
bad for 750 looking at grid Autosport
which is one of the best optimized games
i've ever tested a grid Autosport the
750 passive card operates at almost 40
FPS average on maximum settings so if
you drop down to high settings it's
suddenly pushing nearly 80 FPS that is
more than playable you could actually
adjust some of those settings back to
ultra and you'd have a really good
looking experience with a fairly high
performance car it need to be at 60 FPS
which is all you need in this type of
game and that's not bad for a hundred
twenty bucks and zero noise now i do
want to point out with 750 t is
significantly better value across the
board in terms of performance it's
always going to be better value than a
passively called 750 because when you
introduce passive cooling it's suddenly
more expensive so the 750 is 120 bucks
passively cooled and the 750 Ti is like
130 hundred 44 two gigabytes of RAM so
it's got twice as much actively cooled
so it is gonna make some noise which is
where your Dutchman is but a lot more
performance had nearly 100 FPS on high
settings which means you can run it on
max all day long looking at battlefield
4 ultra the 750 passive card struggled
at 31 fps went on ultra settings and had
slight gains to almost 40 fps went on
high settings battlefield is another one
you'd be playing on probably medium
settings with a few low settings in
there maybe a medium with no AAA it
probably had about 60 FPS which is
definitely playable so not horrible but
not amazing performance there so
all-in-all the GTX 750 by ZOTAC performs
pretty well in most games I was
impressed by it the thermal performance
is actually very
impressive the value is there if you
want a completely silent system if you
don't care that your fan makes some
noise in the background or if you have a
way to stifle that maybe with a case or
with other cooling solutions that are
aftermarket like liquid then you
probably want to be looking towards a
better card the 750ti is within budget
and very high performing comparatively
and and it's actively cooled but it does
well on games and it's cheap it's less
than $150 all day long for two gigabytes
the 750 is 120 one gigabyte which is
plenty for home theater use I don't want
you to focus on that number too much one
gigabyte will get you by just fine for
home theater PC gaming because you're
limited more by the GPU than the the RAM
at that point so other than that the 250
X isn't even really worth considering
unless it has some features or
optimization in a specific game it is
$100 so I guess it's a bit cheaper if
you're on a super tight budget but the
750 at that point is also worth looking
at which is around the same price when
not passive so that's sort of what you
need to think about just to give you a
very clear conclusion here with a home
theater PC that you want to make no
noise and be in your living room this is
a very good card with a gaming PC that
can make some noise the 750ti is within
budget and is a bit better I would
recommend that so that's sort of where
you need to draw the line and figure out
what's best for your needs
very impressive thermal performance
fairly impressive gaming performance and
that's all I will see you all next time
