line of GPUs last fall we've seen the
collection expanded four models total
with the r-tx 5000 on deck today sitting
third from the top or two if you
consider that the main difference
between the six and 8000 is the size of
the frame buffer as a 5000 series card
this Quadra r-tx acts as a high-end
probe is option delivering great
performance of both creative and gaming
applications but doesn't cost as much as
a high-end workstation PC on its own
compared to the outgoing quadrille p5
thousand the neutering based r-tx 5000
gives us more cores 3072 in total
placing its peak performance ahead of
the gaming targeted geforce r-tx 28 ET i
before that this video is brought to you
by e BJ's a new audio sound card
engineered by audio note EVGA a CEO
knows high quality audio and has begun
bringing sound cards back the new audio
sound card is capable of delivering
hair-raising audio superior to onboard
sound the card includes a line in
headphone line out and mic in and a Sony
Philips digital interface new audio also
leverages the EVGA ace PCB design
experience has upgradeable op amps and
uses AKM premium components for its DAC
and ADC learn more at the link in the
description below
while the frame buffer size has remained
the same from generation to generation
NVIDIA has delivered more than a 50%
boost to memory bandwidth thanks to the
move from g5 x 2g ddr 6 while it's
obvious that the latest and greatest is
going to perform better than the same
class card of yesteryear the performance
proof seen with the RT X 5000 come at
the expense of increased power draw but
when it boils down to it the quicker
your renders and encodes execute the
less power you'll be using overall it's
commonly asked why Quadros and Radeon
pros cost so much more than the gaming
counterparts and the answer isn't too
difficult the simplest explanation is
that Rd certifications and optimizations
lead to a good chunk of the cost
representing improved performance in
industry software as well as improve
stability speaking of error correction
memory also plays some of the role in
the cost of the higher end part of the
stack for those with 10-bit color needs
gaming cards are fine for DirectX
applications but OpenGL software will
require pro level cards something that
applies to both Nvidia and AMD there are
some exceptions to this rule but trying
to find a list of supported versus non
supported 10 bit applications on gaming
cards is something that will be done in
vain so if you want to guarantee your
color you will want an appropriate
graphics card
we've covered before there is no
one-size-fits-all where gravis cards for
creative workloads is concerned one GPU
may be fine for a certain task
well another you'd expect to do well
could fall flat on its face to that end
the performance ahead covers a wide
range of different workloads and even if
your application is not covered directly
there's likely some other performance
gauge that's relevant
we'll begin gauging the r-tx 5000's
Worth with the help of some encoding
applications with Adobe's popular
Premiere Pro leading the pack while
we're currently only able to offer
encoding performance we do have plans to
add playback performance at some point
in the future after time can be
dedicated to developing some useful and
reliable tests this first chart is a bit
of a funny one since the top half
performs pretty much identically with
this particular encode this is partially
due to the fact that this is a simple
transcode of one resolution and format
to another whereas a normal Premiere Pro
project like those produced right here
at gamers Nexus will throw in a lot more
variants the more complex your project
the longer it's going to take to encode
and the more likely the GPU will become
better involved in the process there's a
clear point of diminishing returns with
this simple performance look but this
chart still offers a good lesson of
never going to low end on your GPU if
you do you can potentially cripple your
encoding performance with a meagre bump
and model at the low end making a
dramatic impact of performance how do
things change up for a proper project
with this 1080p youtube project we see
more interesting scaling than before but
it's clear that the GPU only has so much
say in a project like this when you
start to pile on effects specifically
designed around the GPU you'll begin to
appreciate having a bigger card more but
if working inside a Premiere Pro is your
primary and most important task you
clearly don't need a top-end GPU to get
the job done but you also don't want to
skimp on the CPU to complement Premiere
Pro now encoding results we have a
magics Vegas Pro playback test as well
as a couple of encodes with the
performance scene in this chart we have
some explaining to do many video editors
could be called unoptimized even
Premiere Pro sometimes but the
unoptimized can really hit Vegas Pro
hard to make a long story shorter in
video performance in Vegas Pro isn't
ideal right now although it largely
depends on whether or not you have a GPU
that is affected by unexpectedly poor
performance surprisingly in perhaps
conveniently the quadrille RTS 5000 is
the only quadrant our entire lineup that
managed to handle this test fine
although again it doesn't
makes sense given the other performance
we're seeing what this ultimately means
right now is that NVIDIA is simply not
an ideal choice for Vegas Pro and we
really hope that will change in the
future
a recent build of Vegas Pro was released
since this performance was tabulated but
follow-up testing didn't change any of
our results fortunately for everyone
involved in code performance is far more
realistic than playback but it's still
unpredictable in some ways you'll notice
that some GPUs end up falling behind
technically more powerful options Nvidia
is turning our detector seems to give
that company's cars a slight performance
advantage over the last gen but it's
still not enough to compete ideally
against AMD and thus we yet again reach
a conclusion that Vegas Pro is AMD
territory
Autodesk recently released the first GPU
powered beta of its popular Arnold
renderer so naturally we couldn't wait
to dive in at the moment
Arnold GPU is in no way considered a
production renderer as it's still
missing some functions you may be
looking for so it currently acts more of
a preview of what's to come and that
time will indeed come when a render made
with the GPU will look like a render
made with the CPU that all said Arnold
GPU is currently only available for CUDA
based graphics cards though that's
something that could change in time as a
current trend seems to be more renderers
opening up a bit more in time Arnold
will also support Nvidia's r-tx specific
features like the ray tracing cores some
software can really earn its beta tag
and Arnold GPU is one of them despite
the GTX 1660 Ti being a capable GPU it
suffered so hard during a render here
that we had to give up and letting it
finish we're talking waiting 10 minutes
still seeing zero percent progress and
then having to kill the process we
eagerly await future versions of the
plug-in to see how this situation
improves the GTX 1660 Ti isn't the only
GPU struggling even the RT X 5000 we're
focusing on is having a bad time
despite being technically superior to
both the GeForce RT X 2070 in quadrille
RT X 4000 it still falls behind with a
different project we get a second
opinion but it's not really a better one
a single GPU failed the first render but
two more have joined it here even
including the more than capable GeForce
r-tx 2060 and we still have some GPUs
falling behind more powerful GPUs like
the RT X 2080 taking twice as much time
as the RT X 2070 AMD's Radeon Pro render
may not be as popular as other renderers
in this video but it's slowly growing in
popularity as a
continues to iterate on its capabilities
instability where AMD has done really
well with pro render is with its
performance while at last check
multi-gpu testing with nvidia is a bit
wonky single GPU configurations
across-the-board scale very well pretty
much as expected the pack of radians
performed extremely well against nvidia
in our Vegas protests but Nvidia strikes
back hard with AMD zone renderer with
his turning architecture offering a
serious advantage to performance we've
gone from 214 seconds with the Titan XP
one generation to 101 seconds with the
Titan RT X the next generation that's a
monstrous gain but you don't need to
tighten our TX to enjoy seriously
boosted performance the RT X 5000 itself
exhibited strong performance placing
itself well ahead of the RT X 4000 and
right behind the gaming focused our TX
20 a DTI moving from one scene to
another finer tune scaling can be seen
but the middle of the chart shakes
things up a bit
Nvidia stop turning cards still lead the
pack with a healthy advantage with the
Titan RT X once again proving more than
twice as fast for this work as the older
Titan XP fortunately for those I in the
RT X 5000 performance is looking really
good right about now naturally we'd have
to point out that the bottom rung cards
offer pretty brutal performance the WX
7100 and RX 590 pretty much croak here
so we can safely say you will ideally
want nvidia turing 4 pro render work or
at least AMD Vega but with the gtx 1660
TI keeping rate up to the Radeon Pro WX
8200 Nvidia has a definite lead over all
the upcoming blender 2.8 brings a lot of
great stuff to the table including an
improved interface for robust animation
tools a brand new renderer called Eevee
and of course performance boost to the
classic cycles renderer blender 2 point
AIDS viewport is powered by the new
Eevee renderer and with the change comes
a brand new option called lock
development or look dev for short
compared to solid shading look to have
loads of project shaders and textures to
give a good interpretation of what a
scene is going to look like when it
renders you'll still likely use solid
mode for most work using looked at
whenever you want to quickly gauge
changes without wanting to wait on an
actual render for those designing their
projects at 1080p you'll be happy to
know that you don't need to go top n to
get decent performance while 60 frames a
second is always a great ballpark we're
not dealing with fluid gameplay here so
don't let the lower values scare you for
this kind of work even 30 frames a
second
when bumping the resolution to 4k the
going really gets tough in videos
turning cards once again exhibit some
seriously strong performance here with
the top three RT X cards we have on hand
ruling the top of the chart AMD's Radeon
7 deserves an honorable mention though
it even manages that performed last gens
Titan XP this chart yet again helps us
prove that you never want to go with a
really low end graphics card when you
were actually trying to get good work
done while 30 frames a second is
suitable enough for luke dev cutting
that in half is not going to bode well
with all of the testing we've done with
blender we can honestly say that the GPU
is going to be much more important for
your render than the CPU you'll never
want to skimp on your CPU of course but
blender is just one of those
applications it doesn't require a big
CPU in order for a big GPU to do good
work alongside it Nvidia stirring
architecture has been on a relative
rampage so far and that continues on
through to these rendering tests the
same three cards sit at the top with the
RTS 5000 sitting in third place ahead of
the Titan XP with a different render
this time an interior scene the scaling
changes a little bit with the Radeon 7
gaining a couple of spots putting itself
ahead of the RT X 5000 it's interesting
that the Radeon 7 handles the more
complex scene better than the simpler
BMW 1 but it's a good thing to see for
the red team there are some exceptions
but overall the faster your GPU the
faster your renders in blender are going
to be there are just going to be better
options at a given price point so
hopefully these charts will help you
make your decision easier we're tackling
many different renderers here but aside
from the upcoming octane bench all of
them require a full software suite to
benchmark Lux mark acts as a great
at-home way to run a super quick test
that allows you to compare your systems
performance to ours funny enough Lux
mark was heavily promoted by AMD at the
launch of its Radeon 7 so the reasons
why are not hard to find out when you
look at this chart with the lux ball
render the Radeon 7 simply dominates
with the same top-flight NVIDIA GPU
sitting behind that in reality the
Radeon 7 doesn't have as strong an
advantage over the rx Vegas 64 as it
does in this particular test but it sure
would be interesting if it did the Lux
ball scene is simply reflective ball
sitting in space whereas the hotel scene
is much more complex thanks to a huge
number of reflective surfaces that grace
the lobby with this project the
performance picture changes a little bit
with the Radeon 7 falling behind the
same 2 NVIDIA GPUs that dominated last
time ultimately both AMD and NVIDIA
perform extremely
lexmark with turing once again showing
some strong performance along with AMD's
Vega based GPUs unlike Autodesk Arnold
renderer chaos cubes v-ray supports both
Nvidia and AMD GPUs however the AMD
OpenCL support seems to be in its
earlier stages or our chosen projects
have at least refused to render without
issue on radio and hardware so for now
we're sticking to Nvidia but hope to add
AMD into our v-ray tests in the future
note that we're avoiding the standalone
v-ray benchmark as his graphics test has
always left a bit to be desired and
ultimately it's based on the older v-ray
3 not v-ray 4 which was released last
fall the first of 2 v-ray scenes we test
with gives us an interesting result
where the RTS 5000 falls behind the RT X
4000 this is one of those occasions
where logic effectively goes out the
window because subsequent testing
delivered the exact same results if you
were paying close attention to the Lux
ball results from earlier you may have
noticed that the quadrille P 5000 fell
behind the P 4000 which was yet another
repeatable result sometimes oddities
happen but it's interesting that our two
present examples involve the same series
GPUs from different generations when we
move to the more complex t sat scene the
RT X 5000 recovers itself from
embarrassment now placing an expected
distance ahead of the RT X 4000 the RT X
2060 keeps close to the gtx 980ti
while the quadrille RT x 4,000 enjoys it
plays ahead of the titan XP
redshift is another renderer that's
going to eventually take advantage of
the RT x-series to RT course but without
those the performance scaling still
looks good the Quadro RT x 5000 is one
of the fastest of the lot again coming
ahead to last gen stein XP and for a fun
comparison well ahead of last gens $5000
pascal pays quadrille p6000 the better
your NVIDIA GPU the better your redshift
performance it really is that simple at
least until the renderer begins
supporting our t axis special features
at which point Turing is likely to look
even more attractive like redshift o
toys octane render supports only CUDA
based graphics cards but that's
something that will be changing in the
near future especially as the company
would like to continue supporting Mac OS
which currently only supports Radeon
from generation to generation octane
render gives us a great impression of
gains with both the RT X 20 a DTI and
Titan r-tx sitting well in the clear up
top the quadrille RT X 5000 actually
falls slightly behind the Titan XP here
hinting that octane hasn't benefited
quite as much from the turning
architecture as some of the other
renderers for a second octane opinion
we've also tested the beta version of
octane bench which not only includes
support for Nvidia RT X but even gives
us a before-and-after score with our TX
off we see similar scaling as with the
original benchmark but when RT X is
turned on the gains are simply
incredible effectively tripling the
performance of any given GPU how this
performance will carry over to the real
world we're not able to attest quite yet
but based on this benchmark things are
looking amazing we took care of blender
viewport performance earlier but to take
care of a bunch more we enlist the help
of spec view perf 13 this is a
standalone benchmark so anyone can
download and run it to compare against
our results the entire suite uses
application traces to reliably recreate
how real applications would utilize the
hardware it's not a perfect gauge of
real-world performance in these
applications but it's a close enough
gauge that both AMD and NVIDIA promote
its use we're going to focus on 4k
viewport resolution here with the
exception of this first test suspect
view / doesn't have it available in 4k
both 3ds Max and Maya are pretty neutral
with regards to performance between
gaming and workstation cards so the
faster your hardware the better the
fluidity of the viewport at least with
this particular test
AMD falls behind Nvidia with the lowly
GTX 16
DTI managing to outperform the
technically superior Radeon Pro WX 8200
meanwhile the RT X 5000 performs
exceptionally well
leaping some 20% ahead of the last gen
quadrille p6000 moving on a 4k
resolution in maya we see fairly similar
scaling as we did with 3ds max but the
quadrille r TX 5000 falls a bit further
behind the GeForce r-tx 20 a DTI than it
did before
it still sits in third place however
again ahead of the Titan XP in quadrille
p6000 the gtx 1080 TI holds on for dear
life refusing to give up its position to
the quadrille r TX 4000 a good chunk of
the software featured in this video
works similarly on both the gaming were
station GPUs but CATIA bucks the trend
it clearly favors pro level cards not
just on the nvidia side but AMD's as
well though Nvidia does seem to have an
advantage overall in the matchup between
the Radeon Pro WX 8200 in quadrille RT X
4000 which both cost around the same
amount Nvidia card pulls comfortably
ahead on the AMD side the radio and
seven once again offers admirable
performance the Titan cards enjoy some
great performance here as well as CATIA
is one of the applications that benefits
from special workstation optimizations
on those cards with SolidWorks 2 so
Systema stakes its preference for
workstation cards and cranks it rate up
the performance advantage for
workstation cars is so strong here
that'd be hard to imagine going with a
gaming GPU for this kind of work if you
check out the show's official GPU
support page for SolidWorks you may be
surprised to see no gaming GPUs listed
at all an added benefit were station
GPUs also enjoy with SolidWorks as the
real View mode which spec view purse
test doesn't take into account since it
simply can't work on gaming GPUs well
can't is a loaded word since it's
clearly possible if not for the drivers
deciding on it but we're talking about a
software solution that cost more for an
annual license than the Quadro r-tx 5000
does SolidWorks cues his performance
heavily towards workstation graphics
cards while PTC's creo only mildly does
with its workstation optimizations in
tow the last gen quadrille p6000 manages
don't press here more than usual but at
the same time the gaming targeted RT X
xx atti performs even better than it
does meanwhile the Titan RT X delivers a
strong lead at the top and the Quattro
RTS 5006 just behind that
in the Battle of Nvidia versus AMD the
green team definitely wins here the
first Radeon to make an appearance is
the Radeon Pro WX 8200 10 rows in if we
add a WX 90 100 to test it likely plays
ahead of the art TX 2060 we saved the
best viewport chart for last and by best
we mean the most interesting well in a
solution like SolidWorks you can get by
with a gaming GPU even though the
software clearly prefers professional
cards Siemens and X unapologetically
treats gaming GPUs like second-class
citizens where even the lowest end
Radeon pros will outperform the highest
end gaming GPU snx is another example of
a software package so expensive that its
users are not likely to gas but the
higher cost of workstation hardware
especially when reliability and
optimizations are weighed so heavily
moving away from applications we wanted
to take a quick look at the RT x 5000
performance in a couple of extra
categories including cryptography as
seen here and also scientific and
financial analysis the better graphics
card is at math the faster your complex
compute jobs are going to complete the
nice thing about SCI software as Sandra
is that it gives every architecture a
fair shake if there's an optimization
available the application is going to be
taking advantage of it giving us the
best possible scenario out of any GPU
for AMD that bodes well as we're seeing
the Radeon 7 lead every single other GPU
in the list even the RX Vegas 64 is
flexing its muscles here following the
RT X xx atti from just a few feet behind
the quadrille RT x 5000 ranks a bit
lower than we'd expect to see here
falling short of even the GTX 1080 TI's
performance performance picks right back
up for the RTS 5000 in the financial
tests now giving us the same top three
we've seen throughout many of these
results the Radeon 7 dominated the
crypto test but Falls a few pegs back in
the financial test it still performs
extremely well when compared to the rest
of the stack on downward highlighting
great gains over Vegas 64 at the low-end
the cards struggle in a test like this
which gives us weird results like the W
X 4100 and W X 5100 performing almost
identically for the most part card scale
here as we'd expect with both turning in
Vegas 7 offering big performance up
lifts with the scientific analysis test
scaling at the top changes a little bit
but the same top 4 cards remain however
the RTS 5000 this time Falls
but behind the others still offering
solid scaling versus the r-tx 4000
sibling you may remember that right
after the Radeon 7 launched AMD issued a
driver update than the LOC double
precision performance to increase its
effectiveness fourfold because nvidia
locks double precision on every GPU that
doesn't cost multiple thousands of
dollars the Radeon seven will always win
this battle being that the quadrille
r-tx is aimed at the workstation crowd
were going light in gaming tests but did
want to get a couple of 3d mark and VR
mark runs in for a basic gauge of
whereas scales at 4k resolution with
specs similar to a geforce r-tx 2070 the
quadrille RTX 5000 nears the gaming
performance of the GT X 1080 Ti and
lingers just behind the last gen
quadrille p6000 in this particular test
the Radeon 7 has the right to gloat as
it sits in between the Titan XP and 1080
Ti with the DirectX 12 times by test
performance changes once again thanks in
part to the same Turing optimizations
we've talked about a few times before in
VR mark Turing optimizations reveal
themselves once again to boost
performance on both the GTX and RT X
cards nothing can touch Nvidia's top two
GPUs but the quadrille RT X 5000 says
behind those if nothing else the chart
proves that future VR content is going
to be gruelling for GPUs and at least in
the case of VR Mark Nvidia strengths in
VR are currently better than AMD's with
all of that performance covered you're
hopefully far better informed now than
you were earlier about which card you
should be pursuing next as covered
earlier even if your particular
application isn't covered here much of
the performance scaling should still be
relevant it's only when we get into
certain higher in CAD sweets when
performance optimizations begin to favor
workstation cards as for the Quadro RTS
5000 it's a lot of GPU in the
significant upgrade over the previous
generation quadrille P 5000 in some of
our tests the gains with the new card
were largely expected but in others
Turing's architectural enhancements gave
us even greater gains in one example we
saw the neutering based Titan r-tx
literally double the performance of the
Pascal based Titan XP sadly that
performance scaling is not seen across
the board but it'd be quite interesting
if it was at around $2,300 the Quadro
RTS 5000 carries a big premium over the
RT X 4000 but it also delivers more
goods such as big performance
improvements in some cases as well as a
doubling of the frame bar
sighs 8-gigabyte is a standard size for
workstation cards today but that'll
change before long and moving from
Pascal tutoring we saw the top-end
Quadro double from 24 to 48 gigabytes so
the uptake in memory demand is clear and
speaking of it wasn't tackled explicitly
earlier but the RTS 5000 does in fact
include error correction memory whether
the RTS 5,000 is right for you largely
depends on your budget and what you
expect to see as a return from your work
Quadro is all about stability and
optimization making it a natural choice
over gaming GPUs but if your demands are
not so critical a geforce card can often
fit the bill but the biggest exceptions
being highlighted in this video and we
once again come to the end of a
