this and the update of the drivers to
nineteen point two point two I think and
that's supposed to fix overclocking and
a couple of other things so yeah while
we're testing overclock and we really
might as well see how far we can
reasonably push Radeon seven without
going to the extremes without going to
dice or something so we're gonna try and
put a water block on it I think this
will fit I'm not sure I don't even know
what it's called so we're gonna try and
put that on there and see if we get
underwater and then overclock this will
be part one we will have two different
parts of this part one it's just going
to be the build up we're gonna take it
all apart again try and figure out what
water block parts fit maybe put a vrm
block on there and cut a DIY a sort of
full-coverage block for radeon seven so
this will be good for just figuring out
how far the card can go under sort of
reasonable overclocking and cooling
conditions it's not a wide audience for
this thing but there is not in sand it's
just kind of fun so let's get into it
before that this video is brought to you
by the gigabyte zi 390 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful zi 390 VRMs for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th gen
Intel CPUs the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a really
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated RGV illumination learn more
at the link below we're gonna use the
medium mod mat today you can buy this on
store documents accessed on net we
actually we sold out of these in like 48
hours but you can reserve one for our
next round it's going to be like two
months probably before those come in
they do take a while but if you want to
make sure you get one go to store
documents accessed on that you can
reserve one so we're working on this
today on the medium matte on the large
match because I need a lot of space for
this and I guess we're gonna try and put
this thing on it so this is from Alpha
cool alpha cool sent us our contact Dave
over there a while ago saw us through
some of these crazy mod videos and he
was like how do you feel about me just
sending you a box of random stuff I
think he called them bits and bobs and
so that's what we went through
I was desperate to see if anything fit
the 64 by 64 vague
a whole space in and we can actually see
I think they're roughly the same size
she was Vega 56 on the substrate so the
whole spacing around this is 64 by 64
and then this is Radeon 7 which is
marginally larger on the substrate
packaging it does have more HP amah you
can see it's got four versus two but the
whole space and I think is the same so
64 by 64 let's just measure this to
double-check zero this out so I guess I
can probably measure this so Center to
Center is about 16 that's that's 64
that's within my measurement error of
using the calipers so 64 by 6 so it's
the same hole spacing as the original
Vega 56 and 64 so that's good that means
hopefully a product exists that will
work with it and this might what is this
even called GPX upgrade kit I don't know
how old this one is but it doesn't
really matter so GPX upgrade kits from
alpha cool a question is will it fit so
here's why here's why I'm hoping this
work this one fortunately has these
slidable mounting hardware so this is
something that I wish we had more of a
lot of like the ASA tech coolers if they
have fixed holes that are just drilled
through and you pick one and if it
doesn't line up there then too bad so we
often use the be quiet CLC that would
also fit here my problem with that is
then we're introducing random hardware I
bought from Lowe's and so the mounting
pressure is a huge concern where this
HBM is some of the most fragile stuff on
any components you buy it's it's really
easy to crack it I've done it actually
with a former small form-factor
component that actually I don't know if
I can talk about killing that one but
but I've done it before and so the way
it dies is you just you apply just too
much pressure and it will crack
internally you'll never see the
crack on the surface but it's really
obvious when you try and use it because
you have memory artifacting so that's a
huge concern as long as you're kind of
safe fish with the mounting hardware
it's fine
we've done it before on Titans but this
will be better um so it's a bit more
complete so I got to take this apart
let's do that and then I will speed
through that we've already done a
teardown previously and we'll try and
see what what can fit on here for water
cooling so today we're gonna use the
iFixit Pro Tech tool kit they are
actually running ads with us this month
so I'll link their link their ad link
down below if you want to check it out
that it's not gonna fit in there so this
I think this card uses like a TR eight
skis a Torx eight or nine and this kit
has one somewhere let's see I don't know
okay there it is TR 9 so we're gonna
throw on a TR 9 remove the backplate we
already have a teardown video and this
tool kit will get us through all the
screws that this particular card has so
just kind of speed through it well this
is really nice now oh yeah I forgot
about my tape so I put painters tape on
here that says something to the effect
of needs new thermal paste because it
does so this card originally uses that
that thermal pad hitachi HMO 3 I think
it is they're all pad and so it was I
mean without it it gets hot and with it
it's on an air cooler so we're just
gonna replace all that today and this by
the way if I could say so myself our
decision to do a dual silhouette here is
helping a lot because now the card is
oriented in the way the card is exactly
wearing sin so we can do the back and
the front screw tracking pretty easily
we're gonna disassemble a 100% of this
thing though and maybe figure out how to
cool the vrm as well
okay so here's the card and quick note
here this is the icy diamond graphite
thermal pad and one very overrated -
terrible on this card do not put this on
Radeon seven we I wanted to test a few
different thermal pads and see how they
all do and against the Hitachi HMO three
and I can tell you that we never
published the data because it was just
it was I don't know it was really simple
it was either you use the HMO three and
it's fine or you get a much tighter fit
than its stock and you can kind of make
paste work but using the graphite
thermal pad from icy diamond was the
worst possible solution and it basically
always overheats so we don't recommend
that but that was on there for testing
that we just did I don't know if we'll
publish that data or not okay so time to
see the the block fits I guess in this
is first amount on one of these things
like the ice wolf that they sell it's
supposed to sock it into there but we do
not have that with us
oh nice and there's contact sweet oh man
that's pretty cool especially since this
is one of the biggest mounting hole
spacings there is I think one of the
Titans goes a bit bigger but this this
is I'm on the top so all right so we've
got spacers to protect the PCB we have
Springs for tents for equal tension and
and caps that'll screw on and I
obviously need to put thermal paste in
there still
oh yeah and all this stuff by the way
just from contact cleaner from an
earlier project so I think those that
looks like it'll work really well we're
gonna use thermal grizzly cryo not for
the pace this - but link leaks because
we've used it kind of an inappropriate
ways mostly by emptying it and then
refilling it later but it's gonna leak
all over the card so this is a cryo knot
it's among the best thermal compounds
for the type of workload we're doing now
if we were going this would still be
good for sub-zero I guess but if you're
really going like under an Allen to pot
then compound choice matters a lot but
for the most part they're all pretty
much within the same range as long as
there's enough and we're gonna put a lot
on here I recently learned from if we
get the clip I learned from on the
screen that would be great it was he the
guy said that it's essentially good PC
building practice to just always have
extra paste on there so I'm just
following their guide right now I think
if we can get that clip up I think their
coverage looked about like this do you I
think he used the whole tube maybe
you're supposed to use the whole two but
I believe that's what he said oh yeah I
need some on the cooler as well okay
someone's not gonna get that joke so
basically that was in reference to the
verge who made a terrible video and to
be fair of the fins that they did
incorrectly too much paste not that they
did this on a GPU that would that
and poorly but too much paste on a GPU
you really doesn't go wrong it'll squish
out it always does you can ask there
Bauer he has the same approach to this I
do the most important thing is to make
sure that there's full coverage I did
exaggerate here like this is this is
pretty this is a bit much
but having too much isn't gonna hurt the
performance here it will squish out now
we we have a whole video on like too
much thermal paste and to really get too
much to a point where it damages
performance you need you to empty
literally the entire tube and then it
would fail because you would crack the
die from all the pressure but in this
instance although it is too much it's
still fine so a bit exaggerated there on
my end because of that video but anyway
the thermal compound it just needs to
cover everything if you miss any spots
on the GPU because you were being sort
of too conservative on the application
then you can actually cause small parts
of the GPU to die that builds lloyd has
experience with that as well I think I
don't remember it was with HBM or with
it with one of the cores but but this
will work out go hand tight here to
start probably just stopped at hand
tight as well is that HBM is very
fragile
we definitely have contact hopefully
it's not too much contact wow man that
clearance that is close so take a look
at those inductors on this diagram that
we have on the mod map which is again on
stored at gamers X's net your inductor
lines right here it be number six on our
diagram this card because it's a bit
unique and doesn't have memory modules
it's just got HB m and E uses almost as
like a horseshoe shape vrm here and so
some of the inductors are less than a
millimeter away from our cooling block
so very close on the clearance it almost
doesn't fit okay so that's a good start
I'm gonna figure out the vrm we it's
powerful enough on this thing that we
can just hit it with air and it will be
a hundred percent fine we've done that
in the past as well but it is more fun
to
and it is more fun to try and actively
cool it it's just not necessary
the problem I have with it I have some
vrm blocks but my vrm block would
probably go here and then we still have
vrm over here and her I'm up here so and
we're clearly not gonna fit any more
blocks up there I think we might leave
it alone we might leave this alone and
just go with a fan pointed at the
MOSFETs that will be more than enough
as a reminder MOSFETs can do like one
hundred twenty-five hundred fifty
degrees Celsius there's a lot of surface
area here and the GP will be running
cool so we're not gonna have too much
sort of heat spread there but especially
if it's sub ambient in which case it
will start the stuff around it will get
a bit cold as well but I think we can
stop there for that part oh okay
they're calling it ingenious new
injection technology which I guess is
what this is because that doesn't spin
so that's just to guide the flow and
let's see okay so I don't think this one
includes a pump based on what we're
seeing there's no power anywhere first
of all and and there's no space either
so I think we're going to need an
external pump that's fine we have some
ek ones we can use and that's just gonna
go ahead and be upside down I guess so I
need to find a radiator we'll throw some
random pump on it and then we'll be good
this I'm just trying to make my life
easier so because now the problem with
the pump and radiator option is it is
not portable like I'm gonna have a hell
of a time moving it between systems or
different rooms or whatever if I do this
it's a pump and radiator combo this is
one of the Phoenix products and I can
just stick quick releases on the other
side of the tubes and come up to the
block and then it'll be really in good
shape so we'll run with this actually
instead of the cool stream okay so this
is not going to be it'll be a semi open
loop rather than a proper open loop but
more portable so let's get some tubes on
there so here's a random may a box of
random liquid cooling parts that still
has water in it so we're gonna get one
of these on one end and then the male
version on the other end there it is so
these are just QT C's they they go
together like this and they're actually
really nice so it's just a button to
disconnect and there's like maybe one or
two drops that come out when you do that
so it's it's pretty easy contain make
sure there's no spillage and it would
make it easier for me later if we want
to get rid of this and replace it with
like a Mora and danke tat an ice bucket
because then I can still leave all the
tubes attached to this we would just be
changing one thing so that should work
out pretty well there's the water in
this one and also oh there's a refill
port over here too okay so yeah I'm
gonna set it all up and I'll have to add
some water once we turn it on let it run
for just long enough to get some water
through the rest of the loop and then we
are going to fill it a bit will leak
test it without the card being powered
just the pump being powered so if
there's leakage won't hurt anything and
then we will be will be good for sure so
okay I just need a few pieces here
change of plan we're going to go with
the ek ones instead the rest of my parts
will fit better so ek here and then I
think this will be long enough for what
I'm doing today which is just gonna be
mounting this thing on a on a test bench
and I'll put the radiator on the shelf
above it so we don't really need a whole
lot of tube length here have more than
we need actually you can already see
some of the water starting to come out I
probably should not have connected those
but we're we're okay because gravity's
cool I guess and so is water pressure
but you can see water starting to come
out over here because we've connected
those two so I mean we're good now cuz
that's connected as well but obviously
if it had run through all the way that
would have sucked now I'm just gonna
connect to the next quick disconnect so
that goes in like this we'll need to
secure this as well can you zip ties or
I have some clamps from ek that might
fit and then we have to connect this to
the one with the balloon in it so trick
here is pretty simple you just hold it
vertically make sure the balloon drains
as much as is reasonable and in fact
actually take a look at that and so
here's your here's your pressure
demonstration when I squeeze the balloon
we get some movement there however
that's just cuz there's some air in the
balloon so I'm going to squeeze it till
there's nothing in there and then we
just hit this button to quick disconnect
and we'll have a couple drops probably
but not too much there's really no
liquid in there which is that's what we
want to see so that means everything was
contained and there's less risk of any
leakage or this isn't really about
leakage there's not much risk if you do
it right anyway it's more about
convenience and being able to easily
modify or remove this loop when it's
time to get rid of it but we can connect
those two it's not particularly pretty
but it does work and now I just need to
see if hopefully my clamps that I've
left will fit
if they don't we can use zip ties though
and that's also good all right cool so I
think everything's secure let's move
some water around get it to fill the
loop nice we definitely need more water
in there but I think we're okay
it would be nice to have a funnel now I
don't know if I have one here okay so I
think this is actually the fill port
that does seem correct though too much
water capillary actions pretty cool and
I think we're gonna be good to go now
the tubes are currently on the ground
but the tubes are completely fall on
each side so that is prepared just clean
this off a little more this table is
amazing there's our there's our
water-cooled Radeon seven card I can't
really put it down right now because
there's some water but there it is
that's what it looks like there is water
all the way through so we're good there
I need to dry off some of the over flow
there when I was filling it and once
that's all dried it is ready for leak
testing and then for actual benchmark
testing so there's our hybrid sort of I
mean it's water-cooled
Radeon 7 except I'm gonna have to put
air on the VR app so it's kind of hybrid
I guess but yeah I ended up replacing
the fill cap down here on the near the
pump because this plastic one is garbage
and after a couple tries it's just it's
gonna be chewed away let's replace it
with the metal one and then I guess the
top over here has like a sort of fill
port I think maybe it's meant for just
burping the air
I need to look at the manual for what
exactly that's for but filling there is
not the correct move so we did have a
shot of doing that and the reason that
doesn't work is what it does go in and
it is connected to the rest of the loop
but surrounding the so the housing that
surrounds that hole on the screw I
didn't notice it actually goes straight
through to the radiator like there's no
catch on either side of it so if you
overfill just a little bit it looks like
water's just sitting on the service and
you can wipe it off but actually it
spills over onto the radiator so the
correct one to use is down here near the
pump that's that's got the bigger
chamber to fill up can fill it here
technically but it's really not the
right way to do it based on current
experience so haven't worked with these
phoenixes a lot and never had to refill
them but that's the way to do it I guess
is down near the pump and then I think
this is just more useful for burping the
air out but either way I'm pretty much
ready to go on tasks you need to leave
test it dry some parts of it off and
we'll be good to go so that's it for
this one as always subscribe to catch
part 2 it'll be I don't know won't be
too long until we get it out but I
subscribe for that you can go to store
documents access dotnet and you should
to reserve one of our medium mod mats
like the one I worked on during this
whole video if you want the larger one
for a bigger workspace that was
underneath and they are currently on
backorder because we sold out in like a
couple of days for the mediums so
they're on backorder if you want to get
one for the next round thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
