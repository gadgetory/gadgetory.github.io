Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
NZXT century 3 fan controller and
temperature readers so the century 3 is
a follow-up to unsurprisingly the
century 2 both of which are five and a
quarter external drive bay accessories
so they install into external drive bays
you would not be able to use this on the
h4 40 case for that reason but it will
fit on basically any other case on the
market the centry 3 is focused on giving
a readout of your fan speed it can show
five channels with fans and it can also
link fans to one another for controlling
them in terms of the speed finally it's
got a temperature reader just one
installed by default though there are
options to install more and you can hook
that temperature reader up to different
parts of your case if you want the fan
to be controlled by temperature and
thresholds rather than manually by you
just a use case example here we've got
five fan channels on the centry three
which means we can hook up five
different fans or we can daisy chain
fans two single channels so to give you
an example let's say we have a case
that's got a two hundred millimeter fan
a 120 millimeter fan and two 140
millimeter fans so the problem here is
if we're using stock fans just for sake
of example the 120 and 140 millimeter
fans are going to be significantly
louder than the 200 plus millimeter fans
and that's just a matter of size and
speed of rotation so let's say that we
want to keep the 200 millimeter fan at
max speed because it's the quietest
anyway so who cares but drop the speed
of the 120 140 s we can actually hook
all of those fans up to different
channels and then we can even link the
two 140 millimeter fans together in a
single channel so when we drop the speed
of them it will impact both fans
simultaneously and decrease the RPM
which decreases the noise levels in the
case hopefully to match your slower
quieter fans and this all of this so far
is handled to touch input so you can
actually link two channels together
let's say you have front fans and rear
fans on your case so you can link the
front and rear channels together and
then when you adjust the the dial there
the dial is actually touch input when
you adjust that to 100% or 40% or
anything in between
it'll change all fans in the front and
rear configuration so that's kind of an
example of how this device works
it displays temperatures in Celsius and
Fahrenheit unfortunately this is done
using a temperature probe the problem
with temperature probes is they can only
read external temperatures generally of
things like the heat sink you can't
actually read anything useful like
t-junction on the cpu obviously because
that is handled at a semiconductor level
on the die and you can't even read T
case because it would need to be
touching the inside of the integrated
heat spreader to read T case so really
what you're getting is a much cooler
temperature than what is actually going
on under the hood so to speak and that's
because we're reading something after
it's already been pushed through the IHS
or even into the CPU cooler since the
Sentry 3 has launched NZXT has announced
and put out their cam software which is
a temperature monitor control to the
software level it shows T Junction it
shows your GPU temperatures it shows
your system specs it's pretty cool it
even integrates with the new grid plus
that I wrote about so if NZXT can figure
out a way to link their future sentry
perhaps the Sentry for 2 cam and use the
T Junction CPU temperatures which is the
actual temperature of the die not the
temperature of the heat spreader which
is kind of useless if they can integrate
those and make it so that the Sentry
acts on the cams readings I think they
would have a seriously good product that
I would actually want on a functional
level not just an aesthetic level for my
system that said the Sentry 3 is still
very good it's it works pretty well the
touchscreen is durable it responds to
input very well it is a bit picky on the
viewing angles the colors look good the
control panel itself functions well and
looks good it looks very sci-fi and
works well on cases in that regard
if you're looking for a cool way to soup
your system after you've already built
it this is something I would highly
recommend unlike the Sentry 2 this one
has very few fan cables and they're all
modular so you can unplug any cables or
channel cables that you're not using and
that just means less clutter in your
case so good news all around that's what
we think about the Sentry 3 I worked
with Michael Mann on this he wrote the
full review hit that link in the
description below if you'd like to
review and some photos and I will see
you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
