testing I thought I'd give you an inside
look as to what's going on with the
first video we basically looked at a
validated Tom's Hardware des testing of
the EVGA FTW VRMs for the 1080 FTW we
have this was also a problem with other
cards 10 60s and 10 70s included in some
cases that's all in the first video and
then we also did a thermal pad
replacement video to cool down the V RMS
to an acceptable temperature now here's
the thing that testing was done with
thermal imaging I'm going to talk about
why that's problem in a second but we
were validating what Tom's did and use
their methodology second thing I want to
put a direct thermal couple probe on the
trouble spots specifically the second
and the seventh MOSFETs to see how the
temperatures look but before getting to
that project this coverage is brought to
you by our patreon backers who helped
out by providing some extra funding
every month and in return we give some
inside looks and this is one of those if
you want to help out with future videos
like this hit the link in the
description below to patreon and you can
check out our page there I'm not going
to recap the entire issue here and all
the testing that we've already done it's
on the website it's on the channel if
you want to look at the thermal imaging
we did but we are expanding on that
quite a bit I've done some endurance
testing as well I'll talk with that soon
first of all thermal cameras so these
are pretty popular these days because
they can plug into smartphones now but
there's a lot of problems with them
they're great for rapid prototyping they
are great for quickly figuring out where
the hotspots on something and have
temperatures actually improved but
they're not necessarily that accurate
they're fairly accurate except for well
I should rephrase that it's not the
accuracy that's the issue it's where you
use it and how you use it and in the
case of these when you're dealing with
something like a tempered glass side
panel on a case or an acrylic window on
a case these are pretty much useless
because of the emissivity of the surface
that's true somewhat for these as well
for video cards looking at a PCB you're
okay it's not quite as reflective shiny
and it's a bit more accurate in that
regard but when we take a thermal pad on
here there's two problems with a thermal
imaging device and it's not going to be
resolved with the more expensive one
either the first is the
civet e of that surface how reflective
it is things like that interferes with
what's being read on the camera the
second problem is just that it becomes
an insulator so when we put a thermal
pad on here yes we saw a pretty big
improvement but if you think about it
you're measuring the temperature of a
pad that's sinking all of this heat and
we don't necessarily know what the
underlying components are measured at
even though they're being synced now
directly to a backplate in the case of
EVGA is this is a metal back plate so it
actually will dissipate some of the heat
so it was a good first test we
definitely saw an improvement overall in
performance of the card I did stick a
thermal couple down there thermocouple
probe like one of these down into the
heatsink for that first test and I
validated the temperatures so we know
that these vrm pads are a definitive
improvement but we don't know the
specifics of how it works with the hot
spots that are way low down on the card
which if you look at photos of the 1080
FTW s and even the 10 70s that folks
have posted online where they've had
trouble the sort of explosions pots
where the the fetes burnout are the
second mosfet and the seventh or the
eighth mosfet which is sort of well just
above the middle so I want to test that
and the way we're going to do that is by
using a thermal probe and the problem
here is these are the ones we have they
are k type thermocouple but they're not
flat they're pretty damn flat but
they're not perfectly flat it's
relatively flat that's not the main
problem though the main problem is that
it's exposed metal by nature of being
something that's reading temperature so
you can't just stick that into a card
because it's electrically conductive the
problem we run into is if I stick one of
those in here I can't really just put it
on top of the MOSFET because now you're
interrupting the flow of heat from the
MOSFET to the thermal pads and so now
your temperatures are going to look way
hotter than they actually are
so our thought was well let's put one in
the middle but now you've got a new
problem now it's touching all kinds of
electrical components including the feet
for the feds sit ups on the MOSFETs feet
touching the capacitor all the tiny
components in there that can bridge
something and cause a short so we don't
want to do that because then the cards
dead or there's damage to it and we
don't know what's going on anymore even
if it appears like it's working you kind
of lose control the situation when
there's electoral issues so couldn't
quite do that the next thought was we
could use captain tape this is ka pton
captain tape is not electrically
conductive it's pretty thermally
insulating it can withstand far higher
heat than these are going to put out so
it seemed like a perfect solution the
idea would be you put some tape around
one of these like this and then it would
theoretically not conduct electricity
and jump any components and it should be
resistant to melting the tape itself
that is so that wouldn't be a problem
the problem that had becomes well it's
thermally insulating so we don't know
kind of how much of our measurements
getting lost in that tape so here's the
solution I came up with I spoke with a
couple thermal engineers in the industry
we spoke with Bobby kanstul you may have
seen a video with him he was the guy we
spoke to at Corsairs lab previously
basically told Bobby hey we're doing
some tempt some some very specific
temperature testing I need a
thermocouple that I can stick to a
surface and not worry about one
conducting electricity and shorting
something and to ideally something that
I can stick to the top of a service
between thermal pads and not worry about
destroying the heat transfer from the
device to the pad and Bobby helped us
out he sent me in the direction of
buying some Omega thermocouples and they
were pretty expensive but I picked him
up and as far as thermocouple goes you
normally spent a couple couple bucks for
one but these are $65 45 and then I paid
a lot for shipping to get them here in
time so these are pretty damn cool
the cable may look like it's exposed
here this is actually housing it's got a
really thin film housing on it so it's
not exposed copper that's good that
means we won't conduct anything they're
short anything or stuff like that then
the end of it here the actual
thermocouple itself is buried within
it's very thin that's important and it's
within a an adhesive pad that can
withstand pretty damn high heat more
than we need to worry about more than
100 Celsius hundred 10 Celsius I'm
worried about measuring and as a final
benefit it's not going to cause the same
issue where if we have one of these
between the thermal pad and the device
being measured the MOSFET we're not
going to have issues with insulating the
thermocouple or destroying the transfer
of heat there will be some change it's
not a perfect solution but it's a pretty
damn good solution considering we're not
a validation lab with a hundred thousand
dollars of equipment so I'm pretty happy
with that now the problem with these
when i got them what huh so there's
always problems never easy this is why
it takes a while do these sometimes
problem of these was these came without
any kind of connector on them it's just
two wires so you've got a positive and a
negative wire and these are I'll give
you a backdrop here so hopefully folks
has been better so there's a positive
and negative wire these have to go into
the housing for our k type thermocouple
zand then that'll connect to our amprobe
thermocouple reader which is what we use
for all of our ambient testing and so
I've already built one as a prototype
we're going to build another one now
basically I'm taking these existing
thermocouples I really like these for
ambient testing for validating
temperature for case tests and things
like that we take a measurement actively
with two of these connected to one of
these and it'll tell us the temperature
see if maybe you can get a reading on
this let me switch these different spot
so they just plug in the top there we've
shown this before but you get a reading
of the temperature so it's about 22
Celsius here ambient temperature and
just
show you that it's kind of working I'll
go ahead and grab the end of it and it
will jump up so that's going to be a
skin temp so pretty cool stuff this is
fantastic for validating the ambient
temperature we subtract it from our
diode readings you can see it takes a
bit to update but it does update pretty
well and it's a second a second
measurement so that's all stuff that we
want this is all good news but what I
have to do is I have to take apart a
couple of these and and put the housing
for the end the actual connector around
one of these and it's not too hard but
we're going to go ahead and do that on
camera here this great tool but it's not
the perfect solution so I do want to do
these thermal couple measurements will
take direct measurements of the vrm take
some of the vrm without thermal pads
some with it and that will tell us how
hot is the thing and its hottest of hot
spots and are they actually dangerous
temperatures the final video of this
series after this video will be after I
analyze all the data and I'm going to be
working with build Zoid from actually
hardcore overclocking will get on camera
together and we'll talk about what our
findings were for all this EVGA vrm
stuff going around I know there's
questions about vram I've seen your
comments I'm focusing on the VRMs for
now because it's enough work already
vram will come next if at all but I can
tell you from our quick look at all the
devices i have here which is for i've
not seen any issues with Vee around
contact but that doesn't mean it's not
an issue I just haven't seen it but
we'll talk about that later let's focus
on the VRMs today so building the thing
this is the easy part the next part of
to tell you about what are our
limitations and concerns when actually
putting a thermocouple a probe on the
device and see if this is right yes that
will work so there's three screws in
these there's a positive terminal here
on the inside that's connected actually
to the screw and a negative terminal or
ground the positive is the thinner of
the two prawns so let's take these out
this will it's sort of open the housing
and there we go yeah third hand here so
open the housing once they're fully out
and at that point we can wrap the copper
exposed wire from our new thermocouples
around the screws and get a better
thermocouple out of it at least the
better one for the specific purpose ok
so these screws just hold the the
housing to the connector I don't need to
take those out or do anything with them
these two screws are the ones that we've
got wires around so if you look at it
you'll see that this is the thermocouple
if you look at the end of it hopefully
that shows up there's a red and a yellow
wire one of those is ground and ones
positive or negative and positive and
they terminate in the metal probe and
touching that is what gives you a heat
reading or even just an ambient it gives
you a reading of ambient temperature so
from looking inside here we can see the
yellow one the smaller instrument the
point the yellow wire right there at the
end of the screw driver is the positive
and that's connecting to this screw it's
just copper wrapped around the screw and
the ground the negative wire is the red
one which also terminates in bare metal
wire and goes to this screw so we're
going to take those apart and I believe
based on my testing I did earlier we can
even take the existing thermocouple out
without needing to cut the cable or or
strip the wire to the cable housing
which is nice because I'd like to be
able to reuse those they're good and I
like that so there you go that's the
easy part it's got really nice housing
but we're not going to keep it for the
new cable your thermocouple basically
you've got your two ends there and those
wraparound the screws let me know when
you have that that's good ok as so now
we're going to move this aside don't
need that anymore get one of these new
ones unwrapped just enough so that I can
work with it and I have to remember now
which I believe it's the same I think
it's still yellow and red and I think
yellow was positive so I think yes that
is correct so we're going to do the same
thing with these really thin ones these
are just flat a like straight cable the
other ones were bent nicely so I'm going
to have to replicate that I will be
bending these do that need just some
pliers or something kind of fine to work
with so I'm going to bend these one at a
time and a lot of this is housing it's
just the very very end that's actually
exposed wire that's decent enough to get
started I'm going to go ahead and stick
one of these screws in there and make
sure it lines up yes ok so this will
work and it's going to be very hard to
see this on camera so a plan here is to
what's the easiest I think it would be
easiest if I get like one thread in
there and then hook it yeah ok so that's
in there so let's hook this around the
screw and all it needs to happen is this
metal wire needs to make contact with
the metal plate that's down here so
that's this plate right here so we're
going to be making contact between that
and the screw as long as it's touching
that plate then it feeds out to the the
prawns and that goes into our
thermocouple reader and gives us the
measurement we want so this is wrapped
around I'm going to look in closer here
okay that's pretty good so we're making
good contact this will be pretty easy to
test and validate once we're done
alright that's pretty good so I think
I'm happy with that I'm not going to put
the enclosure back on we need to
validate it for us to make sure that
it's even reading a temperature and then
hopefully it's reading an accurate
temperature we've got some other
challenges there too which I'll talk
about in a moment so let's put this and
I'll put this in slot wanna put it in
slot 2 okay this is the other one I know
these are accurate already now they
should be like it may be a degree apart
i think is about their accuracy they're
a little different because this one is
this one right here is reading
temperature again through adhesive so
it's not the same measurement as you'll
see what the other but let's take a look
22.7 on thermocouple one that's this
yellow known good one I have the one we
just built so to speak 22.7 that is
pretty damn close so we're at times
looks like we're about point four
Celsius difference which is perfect
that's that's what we want so I'm happy
with that that means this is going to be
pretty representative of what we're
normally used to working with and
obviously there will be more validation
we're not going to show it on camera but
i'll go ahead and put two of these on
the same place on a hot component will
see what the heat temperatures the load
temperatures are but so far it looks
pretty promising since the idols about
the same or i should say the ambient
maybe
alright so we've got two of these off
camera i'll build two more of these
we're going to use for total i have to a
thermocouple readers the same ones so
we've got four total I will be placing
those all over the card the plan is to
do second mosfet seventh mosfet up here
and then that'll be before and after
thermal pad mods and also be formed
after the bios mod that EVGA pushed do
one on the back side to the hot spot is
right around where the inductors are
inductors are going to be dead center
here this channel with kind of nothing
these are the capacitor banks the other
side as the capacitor bank and then this
is looks like our faites so the hot
spots right around here and I know where
it is pretty well because if we put the
back plate on the card which i'm not
going to fully mount it but you'll get
the idea it's always right around here
in this first ventilation port I'm not
really ventilation but you get the idea
so the first hot spots always right
there so I want to be testing with one
thermocouple there for sure so that's
that's pretty good setup now what are
the concerns here so the zoe there's
always a problem this problem with the
thermal camera there's gonna be a
problem with the thermocouples problem
here is we've resolved the electoral
conductivity concerns we've resolved the
thermal contact concerns where i'm
basically i'm going to peel this you can
see it bends like that so on appeal it
will have an adhesive thermocouple we
can apply to the surface which will go
right around here and then i'm going to
cut it to size a bit not too much but
just enough so cut it to size so the
next question becomes before mounting it
obviously how do we route the cable well
the problem is whenever you're near
inductors is a chance a pretty high
chance of
I electromagnetic interference so with
electromagnetic interference your
concern is if we run this cable let's
say we came in from the other side for
some reason wouldn't really want to but
so you coming from this side you might
now by crossing an inductor be
introducing EMI to the system and that's
just going to depend on the device
you're measuring and on the quote Bob
you can still on the black magic
involved with the particular thermal
probe and the card so we don't want to
cross an inductor the way EMI manifests
itself in a thermocouple reader is
basically you have a thermocouple reader
like this and you'll see the
temperatures on the screen bouncing
between let's say it's under load let's
say it's maybe 50 Saul's ease and you'll
get a jump 60 celsius then we'll go to
50 again so there's a lot of jumps that
are really big ranges in a very short
period of time that's EMI you can tell
it could also be a bad brew but probably
EMI so how do we resolve that well like
I said we avoid going over the inductors
directly for one and then two you got to
look out for traces but with a PCB like
this we don't really have much much
choice so we're going to have to cross
traces and the ideally from what the
thermal engineers have told me you want
to cross the traces at a 90 degree angle
but in this case I'm really not going to
have a choice so we're going to come in
with the probe from my thought is from
the PWM section of the card and land on
the fetes that we want to measure after
cutting them this stuff to size so we'll
land right around here and I'm thinking
I'm going to route this cable just short
of the stay away from all this stuff
stated from this stuff I'm going to try
and route it just like that straight out
the bottom of the card and then it will
feed into the thermocouple reader then
we'll do the same up here seventh fat or
eight and this one's going to be a bit
trickier but I'm gonna have to decide do
I want to ride out the bottom of the top
and we need to do it in a way that the
cable for the probe
doesn't touch whatever thermal pads are
on the original solution shouldn't be
too hard really because there's not a
lot of it that's all we're avoiding here
is is that strip on the fetes so I think
we'll be in good shape the next step is
actually running the test so that's what
we're going to do pretty cool stuff I am
happy to get the process started here
with this vrm testing I am sure that
will run into continent some kind of
complication and if we do all obviously
take time to buy whatever I need to buy
or rearrange whatever I need to
rearrange that the tests are accurate so
that may mean you're waiting about a
week for the update but hopefully it
will be the sort of end all be all of
this vrm issue from EVGA so we know
definitively a few things one how much
of an issue was it with the stock card
too does the bios update alone fix it
and three how much do the thermal pads
really do when you're looking through
the lens of a probe rather than through
the lens of a lens of a literal camera
lens because again we've got the
concerns of fem a-- civet e and of the
reflective surfaces and just of the
thermal pads insulating the backside of
the PCB and if you're taking a thermal
image of a device a weed just like toms
did because we were validating toms
methodology we took an image of the back
the PCB that's great but and it's good
for for validating finding issues what
it's not great for is a PCB itself is
sinking heat so we may be getting
temperatures that are either slightly
higher or slightly lower than whatever
component were measuring depending on
what it is and which side of the PCB
it's on because you're going through a
couple layers of PCB there so that
impacts the results but that's the
theory that's the plan thank you for
watching as always subscribe to follow
up on this because there will be at
least one fault probably one follow-up
hopefully the final hun and patreon link
in the post roll video if you want to
help us out directly there will be a
link below thanks to those of you who do
support us already because it does help
with things like this like buying one
hundred dollars of thermocouples and
should be fun test I checked by
soon I'll see you all next time
