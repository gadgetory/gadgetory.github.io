at CES 2019 and i'm joined again by
Justin Walker a 10 video we spoke
previously at the Germany event yes we
did for the taurine unveil this time the
topic is it's it's kind of going back to
that the unveil of torreón but we didn't
really get into more of the information
on floating point versus integer and how
that pipeline has shifted a bit with the
new architecture before that this video
is brought to you by the deep cool
captain 240 pro AO cooler the captain
240 pro uses a bladder within the water
tank to expand and contract based on
liquid temperature as a leak prevention
mechanism this works by birthing air at
higher temperatures making for a unique
closed-loop liquid cooler design the
captain 240 pro also expands upon the
existing captain series by extending
tube length for more flexible
positioning and updating the LEDs learn
more at the link in the description
below so if you missed our initial
coverage we did do a bit of a deep dive
on the turn architecture but it's been a
little while so let's let's kind of
recap it sure why why are we even
talking about floating point vs. integer
or actually we should probably just do a
really quick elevator pitch of what is
that as we're talking instruction types
I guess ultimately right but so so a
top-level recap you know floating point
rows integer
sure so floating Porter integer is just
two different numerical formats right I
mean the the GPU is essentially just
doing mouth and the and floating-point
are integer to different numerical
formats that you can input into the GPU
to do that math and to help calculate
you know the right the right color
values and qualities for the pixels and
depending on the workload you're doing
you could be using integer you could be
using floating point right and floating
point you'll hear like FP 60 and IP 32
stuff like that that's right my hair
referred to a single or double or half
precision that's correct
so you get a number of decimal points
depending on what kind of floating-point
precision you're dealing with and with
the integer I guess it's it's more or
less a whole number yes like 1 1 or 2 or
whatever right an example on the
interface of a game where you might see
integer in speaking with some developers
of some strategy games I've learned that
resource count for example might be used
where you never have anything except
whole number it's it's pushed off to the
cpu typically
in those games but GPU at least with
Tori now there is more ability to work
with integer so yeah
with Pascal how did it work your
pleasure with Pascal are our execution
cores could flip between either
floating-point or integer so if you have
a floating-point instructions you run it
as floating-point if an integer
instruction comes along you stop running
the floating-point and you start running
the energy right so is that is that
effectively an interrupt it's just what
you just swap between the between the
two right and floating-point has been
you know traditionally in the past flow
an important specifically epi32 has been
you know the common format and so that's
why that's why Pascal actually most of
it was you know back in the day Mo's it
was just floating all right but you know
with more modern and complex games you
get more and more of the integer math
and with Turing we updated the the
architecture to be able to process that
integer and floating point math in
parallel right so then to that point
what is an example of when you encounter
integer because floating point for sure
is is is it safe to say it's the most
most common of the two games for games
right so when do you encounter integer
so generally speaking as the game gets
more and more complex and you're trying
to do more more complex things in the
shaders you'll hit more integer math and
more specifically a lot of times compute
when you're running the more complex
compute shaders they'll tend to generate
much more integer math okay so uh games
that would do that and there's a Stein
there yeah there's a bunch of examples
of it I you know Wolfenstein 2 is one
that does a ton of integer math Call of
Duty Battlefront 2 shadow of war just a
few you know a lot of the the some of
the more modern titles that are doing
more complex work and more complex
compute workloads to use a more integer
math okay so then in torreón when you
get an integer instruction as opposed to
Pascal and what's what is ultimately the
this sort of not necessarily a firm
number what's what sort of performance
difference are you looking at though um
it can be very it can be fairly
significant right you take let's take
Wolfenstein as an example you know an
average there's maybe 20 or 30 percent
of the work of the instruction sets
alright okay and on Pascal for any of
those imagers we'd stop doing the FB 32
and we do the integer math okay and then
you'd flip back to epi 32 right on
Turing you can just run both of those
concurrently so if thirty percent of the
instructions are integer we don't have
to stop doing any of the floating-point
calculations we have separate hardware
that will just run through that integer
math right in parallel right and that's
dedicated hardware and that's dedicated
okay so then in theoretical scenarios
you have maybe a 100 percent integer or
107 floating-point scenario and it's
just doing only floating point that
integer Hardware I guess it's just idle
like it's if it's only floating-point
yeah yeah you're just using the
floating-point hardware
okay so then in a jury instruction comes
down the pipe and it just pushed off -
yeah you have a separate X if you have a
separate execution course to run the
integer math is that also the the
floating point versus integer units I
guess is that all in the SMS like it's
within the same block yes that's all
it's all within the SM it's all about
it's all within the the general
computing cores okay and we can find a
block diagram to and prevent screen for
reference okay so we have some good
examples of games that would use compute
workloads things like that I mean this
might be a game developer question so
feel free to push it off to them but are
there any firm examples you can give of
like a certain type of computation or
visual effects or like in game as a
player of the game is there anything I
can look at regularly and say that's
integer yeah that's you're not really
gonna be able to that happens it's such
a deep level in the engine you're never
you know it's not something you're gonna
go see on the screen right more of kind
of a deeper level implementation sure
and I mean the reason the reason we see
it of course is cuz we we we have to
analyze all right yeah we have analyzed
all the workloads coming in from the
game so we can we can see this trend of
more and more integer normal
requirements for integer math right and
of course that's what for the decision
to have separate execution units in turn
is this is this typically something
that's is it happening more on an engine
level like as engines developers there's
more trends towards integer or
individual
developers it's a tan engine as well I
mean it can happen to both levels it's
more just a it happens to be an
efficient way to do the things that the
game developers are trying to do sure
and it's just a way to optimize and the
things that the game developers you're
trying to do so what kind of gets
implemented down from there and and
again this is this is probably like in
epic games or one of those engine
developer questions but my understanding
is that in a lot of instances the game
programmer it's making the game not the
engine programmer the game programmer
just sort of it builds what they want
and then lets venj and figure out what's
going on yeah I mean that'd be great
question for from how I understand it
that's generally the way they would
think about it so I'm just gonna do what
I what I want to do to make the effect
look good and make the game look good
and kind of let the let the lower level
systems and they in the end I gotta
figure out how to how'd it do the math
filter it right yeah okay cool so yeah
we'll put will have some block diagrams
in here you can look at and we do have a
deep dive talking about the torreón
architecture when it first was discussed
in germany so if you want to check that
out it's come on sold we have it on the
channel Justin thank you for joining me
sure thing appreciate the interview no
problem we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
