GN where we try to answer your questions
you have any post questions in the
comment section below for next week or
if you're part of the patreon a
community discord you can go to the
discord channel and find the appropriate
sdn channel so this week we have a
couple interesting questions about one
the one I really want to talk about is
are we in the Golden Age of computer
tech because there's there have been a
lot of changes over the past two weeks
at various companies Intel AMD working
together things like that so definitely
an interesting question to get into
before we get into that this content is
brought to you by the Thermaltake flow
RGB closed-loop liquid cooler which is a
360 millimeter
radiator plus 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if then we'll take it
rain fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
detect pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below so the first
questions from woful who says in the
discord I think are we in the Golden Age
of computer tech like is this a what a
time to be a live time for all the
complaining about memory and GPU prices
I was just about to mention those I get
the vibe from content creators that
there's some really neat tech worth
being excited over what do you think
maybe give us some general perspective
on either how great or not so great
these times are so the the games
industry in the computer hardware
industry tends a kind of operating
cycles where you'll get a slow year and
then a pretty heavy year this was
definitely one of the faster years for
computer hardware we had multiple
high-profile launches so Pascal finished
out its launch with the 1080i that was a
pretty big deal when it happened and
then right around the same time was AMD
Rison there was a thread Ripper Intel
life's $2.99 actually z2 70 and KB Lake
came out in January kind of forget that
with coffee lake coming out in the last
month or two so yeah it's been a really
crazy year and this isn't always how it
is like next year is it's probably gonna
be a lot slower I would think I don't
know if we should expect anything from
Volta you shouldn't expect anything
from for na'vi right now that's further
out and it never has been planned for
next year anyway really volta we're not
really sure on what that's doing at the
moment so next year I what I'm expecting
is less of major architecture launches
and more of unveils of architecture
names and roadmaps for the following
years that tends to be how the cycle
works we're from both a product
standpoint products and manufacturing
standpoint and from a competitive
standpoint the major silicon
manufacturers tend to launch all their
most important stuff all right around
the same time as each other and this
year was a crazy year for that now in
terms of the technology there's I don't
know that I would say it's a what a time
to be alive time because I feel like
there's every other year there's a lot
of crazy hardware but none of its really
groundbreaking to me there's really good
stuff like Rison worked out really well
and coffee likes been pretty interesting
from an intel actually doing something
different standpoint but neither of
those things are revolutionary from a
pure technology industry standpoint if
things like crosspoint that's one of the
more interesting sort of bleeding edge
type of technologies that will we'll see
if that works out to be something useful
in the consumer market there's
possibility for a cross point DRAM
sticks to be really good but we need to
try them to figure that out if that's
gonna be true or not but yeah in terms
of just like legitimately completely new
out from nowhere technologies VR is one
I would consider to be in that category
whether or not it actually worked as a
product for people to buy VR was
definitely in the like defining a new
market segment category risin Coffee
Lake the 1080 TI Vega all those things
are new and are certainly exciting and
worth talking about working on and have
really cool stuff to test but they are
also all in kind of existing products
segments for the audience we work with
so although they are exciting I don't
think they are the sort of revolution
type of technology required to make it a
year of what a time to be alive as far
as testing though because there's been
so much from new architectures and new
tech like HPCC or the one we're working
on right now which is VF curve
scanning and auto overclocking stuff
like that there's a lot of new
technology to work on and that means
from a testing standpoint we get a lot
of cool features so what I call feature
benchmarks where rather than reviewing
an entire product or benchmark and an
entire product take a GPU instead of
doing power thermals noise gaming
production we end up doing just what
happens if we turn this off and see how
it does versus this on whatever this is
or what happens at these frequencies and
clocks and voltages so there's a lot of
good feature test to be done as we've
been publishing over and over but yeah
even stuff like consoles on the Xbox
side it's a really powerful console as
far as consoles go but it's not
technically next-generation so there's a
lot more in the tank I think for the
industry but I don't think we're gonna
see much of it in the first half of next
year at least cases I cases tend to
launch every year in the October to
November range and then again in the
sort of like May area so that would be
right before Computex and then a couple
months after Computex is the review
cycle generally for cases so we'll see
more of those in May with unveils around
CES which is in January but until
someone like put some mesh in the front
and a fan it's not gonna be
revolutionary yeah but lots of lots cool
stuff lots fun testing and things to be
excited about but it is part of a normal
cycle and next year is gonna be a lot
slower I think but we'll see
see if anyone surprises us next question
della Troy says hi Steve like the 7700 K
and 8700 K
are there any meaningful thermal gains
to be had by deleting a non reference
Nvidia 1080 TI and replacing the Tim
with liquid metal similarly is it worth
replacing the Tim between the heat
spreader and the heat spring heatsink I
love your cat
thanks so first thing to note here you
can't really deal it'd GPUs so the term
D lidding is used specifically to refer
to the removal of the IHS the integrated
heat spreader from the cpu and that
would be there's your IHS that's an IHS
right there so d Liddy knows when you
remove this and you gain access to what
is functionally the exposed silicon
technically you'd have to kind of grind
some layers off of that or remove it
from the substrate in the acid or
something like that to really gain full
access but as far as we're concerned
that is the that that is the silicon so
when you deal with one of these what's
happening is you are reducing that
you're reducing two things reducing the
silicon adhesive layer that sits around
this and prevents the IHS from getting
us close to the die as possible and
you're also removing probably the
thermal paste that's included with with
Intel units at the very least and that
allows you to put something better on
there with GPUs you don't deal with them
because they're already exposed you can
take the heatsink off that's not deep
letting it though but you can take the
card apart remove the heatsink you have
access to basically the silicon now and
at this point you can apply a liquid
metal the thing with GPUs and liquid
metal is it you don't have as much to
gain with them because they tend to cool
a bit better than like Intel CPUs and
you also and by the way they're not they
don't have an IHS on them so they have
better direct access to the cooling
anyway and the risk is higher so with a
GPU if you get liquid metal that sort of
just by gravity moves around or gets
pushed out the sides because you've just
had a little bit too much on there then
it's easier to short stuff there's more
stuff to short then on a CPU in general
the surface area is more populated with
things like resistors and capacitors so
personally speaking I don't really think
it's worth doing liquid metal on GPUs
because I think they're good enough as
is
they're pretty exposed to the cooler as
is you gain a couple degrees better with
liquid metal but I mean MIT I just don't
really think it's worth it for the most
part especially because thermal paste is
known to withstand a lot of thermal
cycles you won't really ever have to
replace it for the usable life of the
card and you could replace it with
better thermal paste that's probably
where I would stop though because liquid
metal the potential maintenance involved
in the the pan it is if you end up
applying too much and shorting stuff
it's just not worth it but yeah I don't
know with a reference card there's more
to be had by using better thermal
interface material because the coolers
are so bad but also it seems like a
better solution to just buy a better
card it's just a question of whether
those are available next question is
Hikaru who says I've got a question
maybe one builds or it could shed light
on as well
you always say reference cards should be
avoided is that solely due to poor
coolers or does the PCB also suck after
looking at various reference prm's they
all seem over built parenthetically Vega
and even our X 480 and 1080 1070 so if I
were to be replacing the cooler with an
aftermarket one anyway what a reference
card be advisable as it would save me
some money and help recoup the cost of
the aftermarket cooler that is an
instance where the reference coolers
make the most sense or the reference
PCBs rather the reason that I generally
say avoid reference cards and the same
for build Zoid I think I've seen his
content where he talks about it both of
us generally have the same reasoning for
avoiding them as a recommendation which
is primarily the cooler the cooler the
Ambu vago on the Nvidia 10 series one
they're all bad aha there are specific
instances where those coolers make sense
the
these comes well the main reason these
companies and the non-video ship with
that cooler is because it's versatile
and they don't want to have a million
SKUs and they have partners to take care
of the rest
so the versatility comes from targeting
people like high power or cyber power or
origin folks like that who either for
Wow there's a couple reasons there too
but in speaking with the SIS some of
them have told us that they have SKUs
that they'll ship with blower cards just
because the customers like freak out and
they have high call volume because the
fan isn't spending on some of the
open-face cards which is of course a
feature for no first Hyland's but
customers who know less about computers
might think that that's broken so
they're putting cards that specifically
don't have zero spin fans and another
reason reference cards basically evict
the heat from the case rather than put
more heat into the case so for an IT
Xbox in theory that would make more
sense which makes them a bit more
versatile but it doesn't mean it's a
good thing to buy so if you're doing a
DIY approach the cooler is the reason I
say not to by reference if you are doing
something like liquid cooler a hybrid
mod bind something like a Morpheus or
any other aftermarket cooler the Arctic
cooling stuff my suggestion is to go
with the reference PCBs in pretty much
all cases because they're pretty good in
Vegas case they're very good and if it's
gonna be cheaper then yep it's a win you
get rid of the bad thing which is the
cooler so that's that's most of it
really next question is from well I had
wah deep I don't know 76 question for
ask GN I'm looking to find out what type
of case fans use in certain parts of the
case I use a high airflow fan for the
back exhaust and high static pressure
fans for the a iOS where the question
comes is should I use a high airflow fan
or how
static pressure fan for the front intake
or any intake that has a filter on it
what about a case that has a front
intake with a filter and about an inch
of clearance from the front panel I have
two cases the 600 C and the measure by C
so you would yeah I mean you're pretty
much already using them out you're
supposed to the static pressure fans
you'd want to put on radiators which it
sounds like you already are
so anything optimized for static
pressure is going to do better in
scenarios where the fan is butted up
against something that's creating
resistance and/or impedance and in this
case that would be a radiator which acts
somewhat as a flow straightener as well
and it would also be a mesh filter on
the front of the case or anywhere else
in the case so if you're up against a
mesh filter the a good example would be
the mesh that we used in the age 500 P
mod that's from the top of a fractal
case I think Oren will take one if
you're fighting against one of those
then a static pressure optimized fan
should be a bit better how much better
it is depends on the fan the RPMs you're
trying to push for the noise and the
case as a whole but strictly from a an
optimization standpoint it would be
better to use a fan optimized for a
static pressure in that scenario once
you start getting into places like
exhaust or meshes that are not creating
a lot of impedance maybe it's like the
metal grading type of mesh where it's
got wider holes in the grate and it's
not as sort of flexible and flimsy
doesn't move around it doesn't create a
lot of impedance then you really could
go with the airflow fans and be just
fine if not better off for it depends on
kind of how big that mesh is the H 700 I
comes to mind is one where it has that
metal grading the holes aren't that big
like in the old high airflow cases that
1/2 X for example would be a decent
place where you could get away with an
airflow fan as opposed to static
pressure housewives fan next part of the
question that was I have two cases 600 C
&amp;amp; metruff IC fan recommendations we
found for the the mesh by sea we found
that the the NF
a fourteens worked really well in that
case like they pushed it up to the top
of our charts those are a bit expensive
you don't need them but they they are
kind of our go-to for a fan that will
work in basically any case behind mesh
without issues and have reasonable noise
levels the that servo fan gentle typhoon
that's probably one of my favorite fans
on the market I don't think it's made
anymore but if you can get gentle
typhoons those are hands-down my
favorite fans it's just they're kind of
hard to get yeah that's kind of what I'd
look at we send this question over to
Bobby ken still a thermal engineer at
Corsair this is Bobby's own thoughts and
take on the matter and it's not a
representation of Corsairs thoughts but
as an engineer in the industry who
designs a lot of fans we thought we'd
ask him Bobby said how to select a PC
case fan the ideal solution is to use a
good performing PWM controlled fan with
a wide control range like the Maglev
series fans in every location and then
use the fan controller to set the speed
as needed for each fan these fans can
run from near silent to high power and
everything in between if this is not
possible for economic reasons it or a
lack of a good fan controller use the
following high airflow fans are good for
cases without obstruction greater than a
fan grill these fans perform best in
free air conditions the fan locations on
the back of a typical PC gaze is a good
example they can be used on the front or
top positions if the case grill is
highly open those filters will
significantly impact airflow style fans
and will need to be cleaned frequently
these fans are often that low noise and
low performance and can be run at full
speed
high pressure fans are good for flow
resistant applications such as liquid
cooling radiators those filters and
highly restrictive case openings popular
case designs these days are solid phased
with openings only on the sides if the
solid front is at least one inch from
the fan and if the events are mostly
open then moderate pressure fans will
perform well however if the solid front
panel is closer than one inch or these
side inlets are obscured then the user
will need a higher pressure rated fans
if the front is less than a quarter of
an inch from the solid panel
and user probably shouldn't use that
case or worry about populating those fan
positions except as jewelry as they
won't be moving very much air at all
another thing to look at is the airflow
path for the front Kay's fans if the air
comes in the side it turns 90 degrees to
the back and enters the fan and has one
inch or more clearance then they'll
probably have a good time with a lot of
fans however I've seen several cases
where the fan body is actually forward
of the side events so the air comes in
turns 90 degrees forward turns 90
towards Center and then 90 towards the
back these cases are going to have a bad
time with all but the most powerful fans
so our thanks to Bobby Kim stole for
that information next question is from
Dave core Baker who says hi according to
a steam hardware survey Andy has lost
six percent of market share last month
and more than 10% since risin was
launched and E is now just above 10
percent
I think Intel's better IPC and the fresh
released coffee lay CPUs are responsible
for this
considering that Rison was supposed to
make an t more relevant do you think
rise and 2 will change that so this
question I've seen a lot which is why I
included it here
AMD losing market share in the steam so
the steam hardware survey is not
representative of the whole that well or
not representative of certain markets
and if you correlate that that dip and
and the market share with recent changes
to the gaming environment you'll notice
that the China market share on steam has
recently surged a ton and you can note
that further by looking at the operating
system share where I think a couple the
last steam hardware survey operating
systems like Windows 10 had a lot more
share than they do now it looks like
there's been a regression if you look at
the OS share it looks like users of
steam have regressed from Windows 10 to
Windows 7 that doesn't make a lot of
sense because you think about it once an
OS starts clawing its way up the market
share chain it's not really going to
lose users until a new OS comes out
people aren't going to in droves go back
to Windows 7 particularly given DirectX
requirements so you look at that and you
look at the new influx of users from
China
and I think what we're seeing is more of
a a suddenly a wide audience that's been
included in the steam hardware survey
using older hardware in China like the
Intel CPUs that have been around for a
while now and I haven't looked at the
video card section but I would imagine
if you did you'd probably see it
increase an older video card Hardware
being surveyed as well so if you were
worried that Rison caused AMD to lose
market share don't because AMD if
anything that has only benefited from
Rison for the most part right now so
that seeming dip is not because MD has
somehow managed to lose market share
while launching a product and they feel
it better than its old one it's because
of the the way the survey is conducted
and who is surveyed so if you looked at
if those players in China were always
surveyed then you wouldn't see that huge
drop that we just saw next question is
that I don't write this I don't think I
know here's one r.j. Fleming 82 Steve AI
sweets reports wattage consumed by CPU
using Watts equals current time voltage
I could derive current draw the CPU do
you know if a I suite wattage is correct
I'm not sure about AI suite specifically
but I think it probably gets that from
the same place that Hardware inferred
actually I don't know about that one
specifically I do know about hardware
info 64 though so you could check
hardware info 64 versus what AI suite
says and see if they're the same
hardware info 64 tends to be pretty damn
accurate it's one of the only sensors
the the CPU wattage sensor one of the
only sensors that is actually really
accurate to what the hardware is doing
if you load things like Ada and at times
gpu-z stuff like that early in their
launch for new products you'll see that
the readings are really inaccurate this
happens a lot with a 264 with CPUs it
doesn't have catalogued
we'll give temperature values for
example that are below ambient for
something that's not cooled by exotic
cooling which is impossible physically
so the sensors are often inaccurate with
software when it's still newer in a
launch cycle but the power sensors
pretty much always dead on and hardware
info 64 and I think AI suite might pull
it from the same spot so cross-check
those to anyone who doesn't use harder
info 64 I would strongly recommend it
it's free and it's one of the best tools
for just strict monitoring no
benchmarking built in or anything like
that because frankly it as benchmark is
not very good anyway so there's no
reason to pay for it but yeah if you're
just looking for monitor and use that
cross-check with it
supa says SG on any updates on a ib Vega
kart seems like there are continued
delays we just got another one in we and
you'll probably see the video for it
maybe before this one goes up we just
got the power color card in I'm still
waiting on the Strix bios power colors
asking me to install different bios as
well I think so we're still kind of
waiting on that but the fact that I got
a power color partner card says to me
that we're getting closer to some kind
of actual availability I would imagine
that these companies are probably
panicking trying to get it ready in time
for Black Friday or at least Christmas
sales so it would be reasonable to
expect that I don't actually have any
information saying that's going to be
the case but I have every reason to
believe it will be so that would be my
guess but yeah I don't know they all the
partners have kind of stopped giving
estimates because they they've been
inaccurate so many times at this point
but yeah it looks like hopefully end of
November but we'll see that's my guess
not theirs I think I had one more in
here this one might be from Liquid Paper
I think I didn't write down the name I
have a question concerning ABX offsets
and cable 8 coffee like some people are
reporting across multiple boards that
AVX offsets don't always work I
this issue the CPU clocks to whatever
AVX offset is and regardless of a VX
workload so I I actually haven't seen
this on our coffee like board yet we
were mostly using that ultra gaming
board we've done a little bit with the
Asus board but one thing so I'm sure
you've already done this but for anyone
who has this question if you're trying
to figure out if a VX off that's working
you can load prime95 26.6 which is a non
AVX version of prime and run that and
see if it applies the offset if it does
not then that part's working I was
expected because it's non ABX so it
shouldn't then you load prime95 28.5 or
29.2 both of which are a VX run lfts or
something and if it does apply the
offset then it looks like it's working
you can also use blender if you download
blender and one of their sample projects
files it should apply the AV X offset in
every case that I've tested and most
games should not apply the AV X offset
I'm not sure specifically of any games
that using a VX I'm sure they probably
exist somewhere but yeah so I don't know
the answer to your question I haven't
seen that personally and I haven't heard
of it other than your question but the
reason I'm including it is because
hopefully that other informations
helpful of people and then for anyone
out there who does have that problem
please leave a comment below with the
motherboard you're using the CPU you're
using and a brief explanation of the
behavior so that we can look into it and
maybe this liquid paper and chart comes
here you can figure out what's going on
on there and so that's it for this time
