Nexus tonight and today we were playing
the castle story prototype which I
covered in Saturday heat signatures
several months ago
it is a voxel-based RTS this video is
made for those who have the prototype
and want to get started playing because
it is quite confusing so this is a
consider to say crash course a very fast
crash course and how to play the game so
first obviously hold space I'm gonna let
you figure out some of the movement
because in the top right you can hover
over these and they have tooltips but
hold on space and use WASD to pan then
scroll to zoom in and out now that we
have controls basically figured out you
know you can do more like rotating by
holding right-click you are gonna need
to actually start playing so grab some
brick Tron's we are going to click down
here on the the lumber icon because you
need wood to start with grab the lumber
though an icon on the right side click
on somewhere you want to harvest lumber
from let's grab this because it's in the
middle of quite a lot of trees and now
select the brick Tron's you want to to
be harvesting I'll grab three and right
click on the blue icon that you've just
created if you don't click on the icon
precisely they will cut down trees and
not actually collect the wood so click
that icon they're gonna cut down trees
and start picking up logs but will have
nothing to do with them that is because
we don't have a stock file yet in the
bottom left click on the build icon
that's the hammer the right side click
on the stockpile icon and play some
stockpiles I'm not gonna do anything too
fancy here because it is a tutorial so
let's one thing I want to note is you
should make some room between these
because brick Tron's do have a habit of
getting stuck and and that's just how
the prototype is right now but it will
be fixed eventually I'd imagine so you
can replace your stockpiles then you
click on a brick tron and right click on
these stockpiles to to actually have
them use lumber to build them now one
thing you might notice because this
actually eluded me first I don't know a
good 20 minutes see maybe
is when you click on an icon like
stockpile and place it you know I have
this stupid blue thing that you can't
really like obviously get rid of even a
quick right-click doesn't get rid of it
clicking cancel doesn't get rid of it
what you need to do is click on the
build icon again and then hold down
right click go to back and it's gone
simple as that so I've got somewhat
being collecting some falls off just
don't worry about it what we need next
is to start start harvesting resources
from the ground so mining as it were
click on the mine icon I will note that
it is far easier to tunnel then to dig
down this is due to the glitches in the
current prototype build because brick
Tron's do have a habit of getting stuck
in vertical mineshaft so place your
tunnel wherever you want to place it
that seems as good a place as any and
now you come across well how do I expand
this thing so you click on the tunnel or
click on the icon for it that will
select the tunnel and then you see this
yellow thing just click on that turns
green click it again and you're double
clicking it to expand deeper into the
into the mountain here you can also
click it on the left or right to expand
it long ways and once you've got a shaft
that you're happy with for mining select
a an idle worker or two right click on
that twice the icon and he will start
mining as simple as that so let's grab
Gil and ores this guy's ain't Biba
Gillan Biba the the miners and they're
gonna start mining so we've got three
idle guys now we could start more mines
more forest forestry places or we can
expand an existing one now this is just
mostly for your information you can
click on a forest icon or wood cutting
area and click on the military icon in
the middle of the the top left panel
then click on increase to increase the
radius of this you will see number of
trees go up as you increase the radius
and that will just use the same icon and
kind of expand it so why is that
important well if you want to decrease
the trees that have been harvested or
increase it you can do that pretty
simply so they're gonna keep grabbing
wood I actually don't need that much
more wood so once this guy's back I'm
going to send him to a vertical mine we
will create so let's do that click on
the mine icon again you can click on
this + if you would like to create a
separate sheet or group for it and we're
gonna create a vertical mineshaft by
clicking on that icon click and drag
where you want it I'm gonna keep it
pretty simple we'll just put it right
there so as to not be too much in the
way and then we'll dig down a way you
just move it vertically to dig down so
I'm just gonna end it right there and
you can actually click - oops excuse me
excuse my blunder there let me just
place that down really quickly again
come on there we go okay so we're gonna
dig vertically and click to choose the
vertical height and then you can right
click to choose the stair placement this
is kind of important because if the
stairs exit in a in an empty area then
your guys might get stuck so that's fine
for now and let's send a send of bricks
on over here to work on that you can see
we we have brick drops you can't place
their blocks because there aren't enough
stockpiles so I'm going to create some
more again nothing too ultra fancy just
need places to put all this extra wood
and stone for now and once they have
that done our guys can get back to work
so I should have another nope that's all
five
okay so pinkies gonna start working out
that I'm going to grab Deva over here
and we're gonna start building a very
simple castle nothing again that's it's
too crazy because it is just a tutorial
so let's let's go click on your build
icon you have all these options over
here you can also right-click for a
quick menu and we're just gonna grab the
normal bricks
and build a a sort of house or Hut
rather than a full-blown castle so I
will have an advanced tutorial for
multi-layered castles and and for some
other things like bridges and stuff like
that but for now we're just gonna place
down these bricks now one thing you will
notice
see how I'm colliding here with the tree
we can actually go mine out that area if
we want to flatten it or if you are
unhappy with the placement you can
actually just delete these by holding
shift and left clicking on the place
bricks and then you can of course
reposition them to somewhere that you're
more happy with so we're doing that
right now and I have a pretty simple
castle I'm gonna use a half block to
fill in that last square so pretty
straightforward if you want to delete an
existing block same thing you can hold
down shift and click on the existing
block and let's grab the appropriate
size there and then a brick tron will be
by shortly to destroy that block so
those are there's pretty much the basics
there's really not a whole lot more to
it than that there are of course many
small things lots of glitches I want to
be to get a try and save you the trouble
and warned you of a problem that cost me
a couple of hours of work earlier
because I was dumb and did not say
frequently but first of all not everyone
can save so as soon as you get in the
game hit escape try to say if make sure
you actually can before you dedicate a
lot of time to it secondly don't click
this button whatever you do return the
game will make it so that you can never
get your menu back you hit escape and
then you can actually get your menu back
so just use the escape button to get in
and out of
menu don't hit return to game because
the menu will not return and you will
not be able to save your progress so
that is pretty important to know with
that I think we have covered most of
these starting your castle basics there
I will note that you can get more brick
Tron's as that is another frequently
asked question you do so by harvesting
these these blue crystals here as your
miners run into them they will dig them
out and harvest them automatically but
they cannot place them on stockpiles you
will need to create barrels which are
over here you can create barrels I would
recommend placing them near the crystal
because that's where they have to go
anyway you create bills they drop the
crystal in there and then you get a new
brick tron as long as it's in the
vicinity of this crystal you can pick up
at an existing barrel by simply once it
is built if I can get someone take head
over here and build it once it is built
they will you right-click your brick
town on it you might have a double click
it he will pick it up and then to put it
back down you hold shift and you
right-click in here you at the target
and that's that's really all there is to
it we're not even gonna let him finish
building it actually because that simple
so if you have any questions please let
me know what is up and I will try to
help you out there's an advanced
tutorial coming next this is a pretty
good getting started getting started a
primary excuse me so please like comment
and subscribe and I will see you guys
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
