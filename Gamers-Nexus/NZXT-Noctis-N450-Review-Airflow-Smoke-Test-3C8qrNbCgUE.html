Nexus tonight and today we're talking
about NZXT s not this 450 case also
called the N 450 this new case by md xt
uses the existing h 440 chassis the
frame so the interior of the h 440 is
effectively identical to the interior of
the n 450 the new case and to that end
if you like the interior of the H 440
you might like the N 450 but it's got
some pretty big aesthetic differences
for those who did not like the interior
for the age of the h4 40 for whatever
reason you will definitely not like this
case also because it uses the same thing
the new Noctis 450 by NZXT costs 140
dollars which it puts it in the
competitive price range of quite a few
other cases it is certainly entering the
enthusiast range of computer cases and
is competing alongside items like the
Corsair 760 t which is currently priced
at about $140 after discounts other same
range competitors would include the
silent base 800 buy be quiet which is a
slightly different target market and
fractals arc XL which is again a
slightly different target market but
they are all $140 cases the main selling
point of NZXT s noctus of 450 is
entirely that it uses the h 440 frame
with a new look and in an interview with
NZXT s former case designer chun-tae who
worked on this case we learned that the
noctus 450 was an attempt to move away
from the negative connotation associated
with gamer quote unquote chassis and
that would include things like ntsc's
old Guardian which is compared to this
quite hideous if we're all being honest
here and NZXT isn't the only company
that's done this aro cool does it Sigma
tech Zalman anyone who makes a
quote-unquote gamer aesthetic case is at
some level and at some point in time
guilty of using very cheap quality
components very cheap plastic and
creating what might look cool to a
certain audience but once you get it in
your hands you realize that this is kind
of cheap and I actually don't like it
anymore so that's what they're trying to
move away from with this NZXT really
wants to differentiate themselves by
employing them
artful use of the Yammer look without
being cheap or gaudy and it's really up
to you guys to decide that I will review
to the best of my abilities but I'm
trying to remain objective so I will let
you decide if you like it or not going
over the course pecs of the n450 we
learned that there are 3-1 20 millimeter
fans in the front 1 140 millimeter fan
in the back and that's about it for the
stock cooling so you've got a very push
intensive configuration and in our smoke
tests we show where the hot spots are
and if there are any dead zones and yes
there's a new smoke test now I want to
make a quick note that a lot of cases on
the market especially thermal take cases
will make very heavy note of how many
radiators they support where they
support them what type of radiators and
it's cool I like that people want to
support liquid cooling and there are
definitely users who will make use of
that especially with open-loop stuff but
at the end of the day the vast majority
of gamers system builders buying these
cases are maybe deployed one liquid
cooling unit so I wouldn't get too hung
up on case specifications where you're
choosing between cases strictly because
of the radiator count unless you know
that you're going to be using more than
one for example if you're cooling the
GPU with AC LC as well as the CPU
speaking of radiator support the n450
has 25 to 26 millimeters of clearance
above the steel of the chassis in the
compartmentalized top panel so if you
want to install your radiator up there
there's just barely enough room and then
you can install your fan on the
underside to hold it in and we recommend
a push configuration in that instance
some radiators we found will have
difficulty fitting in the case at all
including the sidon series which is
becoming increasingly rare due to a
thrashing put forth by ACE attack who
sued coolermaster for their Sidon series
but also things like an Tex larger 1250
another cooler brand product and this is
because when you install them they'll
hang down from the steel chassis and
then you obstruct your EPS 12 volt
connector and that is inherent with any
mid tower case you just don't have the
room to play as you would with a full
tower case the big thing with the n 450
that's very easy to overlook because it
was also the big thing with the h4 40
and the s3 40 is the power supply shroud
so the power supply shroud on this car
the power supply it covers the cables
and it even connects with the drive bays
and then covers all the drives the s340
doesn't have drive cages in the same
fashion it uses a cable management bar
instead but the h4 40 did obviously
because it's the same chassis and the
fact that there is continuous coverage
from the power supply to the drive bays
is actually noteworthy because you have
other companies like the old half x by
coolermaster made several years ago
attempted to install a power supply
shroud but it's pretty poorly executed
anyone who used it will remember that
they just removed it most likely and
then more modern cases like the fan tax
in thule ox which does make use of a
power supply shroud and very closely
resembles some NZXT products has a gap
in the shroud to the drive bays and it
doesn't look that great so this is
something that NZXT does very well cable
management of course is a big deal these
days with just about any case and in the
h4 40 and now the m4 50 the new case the
the cable management pass-throughs are
all the same so if you know them then
you already know them for them 450 but
items that are worth noting that NZXT
does well would include the pass-through
on the power supply shroud at the top
for the PCI Express connector so you can
shoot a PCIe connector straight through
the PSU shroud and eliminate the need to
go behind the motherboard tray which of
course reduces clutter and makes it
easier to close the panel on many other
things so I goes straight into the video
card and that is a feature that I am a
fan of another item that is very small
that I don't think many people will
notice is that NZXT actually has several
pastors for the EPS 12-volt connectors
up at the top where the motherboard
mounts at the very top of the case and
this is worth noting because not all
motherboards position that EPS connector
the same spot so with some cases you end
up having issues connecting the EPS
connector you need to route it a
different way or get an extension cable
because it's not in the right place and
that's because boards will position it
either left or right or center of the
CPU so obviously build quality is a big
thing here as evidenced by NZXT efforts
to make the m4 50 a poster child of
modern gamer cases and and the higher
build quality that and ZX e wants
associated
them so we analyzed this carefully with
everything ranging from the chassis
itself underlying frame the structure
all the way down to the thumb screws in
the paint and that's pretty big range of
things but I've got a few items of notes
for you
first of all the chassis is very sturdy
and this is something we know from the H
440 the plastic paneling feels good it
has a good feel it has a good look
maybe not aesthetically depending on how
you feel that's a subjective item but in
terms of the actual quality of the
plastic and the paint it does look
pretty good unfortunately there's a lot
more to it than looks and if you just
even run your fingernail lightly on the
surface of the plastic it will leave a
mark it will Mar the case that is not a
permanent scratch it can be rubbed off
with just basically brushing your hand
on it so it's leaving a trail dead skin
or something I don't know something
gross but that does speak to the quality
of the paint it does give concern that
the paint is not particularly strong and
this is something that was reinforced
when I built the system I built it on
this table actually so I was building it
on this table and I ended up with a
couple scratches in the case and the
paint on the panels and that's really
something that doesn't normally happen
the h4 40 uses a different type of paint
I can tell just by feeling it it's a lot
stronger it has zero scratches on it and
it's been through a hell of a lot more
build cycles in this case which has been
through to build cycles so that is a
small mark against the n450 if you're
careful and you keep this in mind when
you're building and when you move it
around you'll probably be okay there
might be one small scratch but nothing
too terrible another very small item of
note that I want NZXT to resolve is
their thumb screws and they they've
heard me complain about this before but
in many of NZXT teas recent cases it has
been the case that the thumb screws are
over tort when I receive the case and
when many customers receive the case I'm
sure and this is just a factory issue if
they could get the torque spec right I
could actually use my thumbs and fingers
and whatever to take the thumb screw out
of the case and not have to resort to a
screwdriver now obviously I can use a
screwdriver to take it out so it's not
like it's a an inhibiting issue but if
you're going to have thumb screws you
should go through the effort of making
sure
the user can actually use their thumbs
to remove the screws otherwise might as
well just use a cheaper screw and other
cases from competitors do this a little
bit better especially Corsair ease of
installation is the same as the h4 40 so
if you want to know more about that
watch our h4 40 review the short form is
that it's very easy to install system in
this case it does not have a five and a
quarter base so keep that in mind when
you're buying parts but the lack of a
five and a quarter bay does lend us some
benefits elsewhere like less clutter a
smaller drive cage area and generally
just better air flow and looking better
solid-state drives can be mounted on the
top of the power supply shroud which is
something I like because I like showing
off the surface of the SSDs companies
like PNY and Kingston go through efforts
to make them look good these days let's
talk about the smoke test so this is
something that first let's make it very
clear our smoke test is not scientific I
have not finalized methodology for it I
am not using a thermographic imager to
log better results at hotspots but just
for sake of experimentation and fun and
learning about how cases work we decided
to build a smoke testing rig ie large
piece of cardboard that was insulated
and a tunnel connecting the smoke test
chamber to the case where the intake is
and then ignite a smoke pellet used for
testing HVAC leaks and things like that
and this shows in the high-speed footage
the air channels of the case and we
recorded this at 120 fps and at 60 fps
using two different cameras helps us
slow it down and we can see where the
hotspots in the case are so if you watch
very carefully here you'll see that the
smoke sort of swirls in a circle in the
top right of the case and the bottom
right of the case and these are in one
aspect significant areas the bottom
right being near the GPU and this world
is happening because the intake comes in
at the bottom fan it's the the bottom
most fan comes in hits the video card
some of it gets sucked into the video
card and then the video card does not
have the capacity to pull in all of that
air so the rest of it ends up spinning
in a vortex until it can be consumed and
spat out the case if you look closely
you'll notice that there's very little
exhaust at the bottom of the cake there
are a couple of drilled out holes
but nothing major there's no fan back
there and this will be impacted based on
the video card you have more so than the
case but the case can certainly assist
in the dissipation of thermals toward
the bottom and this is especially true
when you have a side fan and I've yet to
find a case that has a side panel fan
that does not cool the video card better
than those without if you watch closely
all the air gets siphoned out the back
very quickly and it even accelerates as
time goes on as more smoke fills the
case as a CPU fan speeds up it shoots
out the back and then the rest of it
sort of drifts toward the top and this
is actually useful information to know
so what we can learn here functionally
and practically from the smoke test is
that you should not install a fan on the
top rear position the back most position
this is something I've tested in the
past with thermal benchmarks proving the
statement and this is because it will
siphon air away from the CPU cooler so
you end up with a warmer CPU as a result
and it doesn't actually give you any
benefit if you want to install a fan on
the top and not a radiator just a fan
you should do it in the front top
position because that will actually
assist in getting some of the air out of
the drive cages if you look in the drive
cage area there's actually a lot of
sitting smoke and having a fan in this
position will pull that away and shoot
it at the top of the case so it's not
perfectly scientific and we're still
developing it but it's a cool test it
sort of shows the very basic concepts of
air flow in a case and it does so on a
super cheap budget I mean we can't
afford the high end air flow testing
chambers that these companies have so
it's not a bad move so that is the n450
overall it's a good case it has a few
points of improvement and the $140 price
point may be out of reach of some users
the aesthetic is cool and well executed
but again not for everybody if you want
something more subdued look at some of
the other NZXT options the s3 40 the h4
40 included or look at their competitors
like Corsair is 760 T which is a really
cool case and has a big quality glass
side panel or even fractal products the
arc XL is an example of something sort
of different the be quiet silent bass
800 is a very quiet case it's bigger
than this is a lot more plasticy but
it's quiet and
it's the same price so you've got plenty
of options out there the m4 50 is worth
a strong consideration check the link in
the description below for more
information on this case and be sure to
check back in about a month when we get
our thermal benchmark fully operational
and we're executing thermal tests again
we haven't done that four cases in a
little while and pretty excited to get
it set up so subscribe to the channel
and I will see you all next time
