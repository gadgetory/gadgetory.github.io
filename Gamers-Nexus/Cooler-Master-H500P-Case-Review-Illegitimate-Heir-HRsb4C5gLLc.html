Coolermaster H 500 P okay okay we're not
gonna so this is the Coolermaster H 500
P it is not officially called a high
airflow case but all the materials we've
been given in the reviewers guide and
presumably in marketing materials
publicly has made references to high
airflow design which obviously it is a
bit of a callback to the half series one
of the biggest cases I've ever worked
with was the 1/2 X and this is the first
major return to what is kind of a
spiritual successor to the 1/2 line for
Coolermaster though it's not really
truly a high airflow case because it's
got all the paneling so it has an
acrylic panel on the front acrylic panel
on the top and then tempered glass on
the side so it is a bit of a departure
but that's why this now falls under the
master case series rather than an
official 1/2 series but it is the H 500
P and obviously as a throwback before
that this is brought to you by the EVGA
240 CLC which is a $120 MSRP closed-loop
liquid cooler the EVGA 240 CLC has an
RGB illuminated pump plate uses a
thermal probe within the lower pump
chamber for liquid temperature
monitoring and allows customization
through software it learn more at the
link in the description below the case
itself is flawed in a lot of ways I'll
admit but with Patrick and I were
disappointed in this case when we got it
and we had much higher hopes just
because of what we'd seen at Computex
and later on at other shows but the
thing is all those events we never got
hands-on time building with the thing so
you learn a lot about a case when you
actually build in it and it's not just a
display case so that says a lot about
the configuration here it clearly is
appealing to people this is the most
hyped case since really any case I can
remember recently in fact the H 500 P
has gotten more hype in the industry in
terms of new products probably then Vega
and to some extent even coffee Lake I
mean videos with this case have gotten
more views than GPU and CPU reviews
that's absurd and really speaks to
something about the case partly
marketing but they haven't done a ton of
marketing so a lot of it is building on
an existing brand half bringing it back
after absence for so long and having
something that obviously looks pretty
good on camera that's what they've done
well here what they haven't done as well
is a lot of other things for example
this panel is less of a concern than the
front panel but the front panel if you
pick it up touching the front panel it
probably will come out so I mean once
again just to kind of illustrate this
there's the front panel the way this
mount instead of having the normal
alligator clips like pretty much any
other case on the market they have hooks
on the bottom and then they've got these
that don't clip into anything they just
kind of sit there also it creaks like
McDonald's toy in terms of plastic
quality so yeah not the best quality
materials on the panel in general I mean
just nothing about the panel is quality
nothing about this panel is quality so
cooler master is cheaped out in a few
places with this case that are really
just disappointing especially
considering the hype around it and a lot
of the hype does come back to you we'll
just leave that like that looks fine a
lot of it comes back to these fans these
are 200 millimeter fans that have more
or less been absent since previous high
airflow design cases from Coolermaster
they just kind of died and 200
millimeter fans are hard to make first
of all there are four three or four
different specs for 200 millimeter fans
in terms of hole spacing and some of
them were 180 some were 200 there was
like a weird one in between there
somewhere like a 193 or something
there's a 220 so there are a lot of
different specs and no one agreed on it
which made them fall out of popularity
they have a lot more weight in terms of
just the blade so you need a more robust
motor in the middle and bearing and
they're expensive and if you do a cheap
one it's just not going to perform well
at all
so this is a return it's gotten a lot of
interest these things also suffer of it
with static pressure and because of that
your position behind an acrylic panel
obviously no air comes through here
but the side ventilation looks pretty
sufficient it's actually about an inch
or so of ventilation and in our testing
in the past we found that's pretty much
what you need to get good airflow with a
case that blocks out front ventilation
like the s 340 or HP 440 v2 where they
breathe only from the side of the front
panel so that's generally sufficient
however if you notice these are actually
mounted to the outside of the frame the
chassis and because they're mounted to
the outside the chassis actually less
than half an inch of this about one the
width of one finger is what the fans can
breathe through so most the air ends up
coming in through the top through the
bottom and oddly there's sort of a skirt
down here that's match a bit of it comes
through there as well this skirt wasn't
there at Computex I don't know if was
added later but air comes through there
and that's kind of a filter to some
extent so they've got a serious airflow
problem for being something that calls
back to high airflow we'll be talking
about that in the thermal section the
that's much less of a problem though
than the build quality the whole problem
is basically it just puts it
middle-of-the-road don't spoil all the
charge but that's kind of where it goes
the build quality you know this is stuff
you only deal with lifting up the case
probably watch it twice and once you
figure out that the panel is loose like
this it's not gonna bother you again
you've learned it you're not gonna not
gonna get stunned twice by it so it's
less of a thing to complain about but
it's still just like why and we ask that
question we asked why wouldn't you do
even just a cheap alligator clip made
out of plastic and the answer is
basically cooler masters planning things
for this case for the future that we
can't talk about yet but I still
disagree with the decision even with
those future plans the top panel more or
less the same thing in terms of build
quality just kind of I know this one
much much less of an issue than the
front panel but they are cheaper
materials and that's disappointing to
see I do really like the top frame for
radiator and fan mounting they've done
that well the fact that there's a frame
up here to mount separately means you
can really easily go through everything
and install it
and that's good the fans look good on
the front as well they've got a 140 in
the back I think yeah that helps with
exhausting the heat and there's a
vertical GPU mount following the trend
there's tempered glass following the
trend the fans are RGB so I've done a
lot of things kind of right but they've
also done a lot of things wrong and I
mean on the on the good let's go through
the good quickly fans look good looks in
general obviously are subjective but a
lot of you have expressed interests and
desire in this design that they've got
despite the quality of materials when
you touch it it is again a bit cheap
like McDonald's toy plastic but it looks
ok and you're probably not gonna be
touching it more than just a build so we
we can try to brush that away to make
room for other bigger complaints it's
got a power supply shroud that can be
removed in pieces so that's nice you can
more easily work with it the bad a lot
of stuff I've gone through already in
addition to the other stuff we've talked
about there's no RGB controller despite
IO panel preparation for it there are
actually fake buttons up here for RGB
cycling similar to the C 700 P buttons
but they don't actually work there's no
controller you could buy one for 20
bucks from Oz I or something like that
but otherwise you basically have to plug
it into a motherboard not every
motherboards gonna have RGB lighting
headers it's getting more popular now so
we'll kind of again brush that one a bit
aside as a small complaint that's not
really worth much in the grand scheme of
things the tempered glass panel though I
do have a bone to pick with it's wobbly
like crazy like this is I'm just kind of
pushing on it here and see that like
this is this is kind of absurd and the
reason this happens is because the panel
is mounted with a screw which by the way
is already losing its it's a finish it's
getting kind of copper colored in there
it's mounted by this screw it's just a
turn so it's a hinge or a latch it's not
actually threaded and so you turn it 90
degrees and panel loosens and then it's
latched or hinge - down at the bottom as
well and ultimately what this means is
they've got fewer screws in the panel
though there's one
Center now it's more noticeable anyway
fewer screws in the panel it lets them
hinge the door rather than just kind of
mount it on four rails and then the
panel would fall off like you see on a
lot of the other cases on the market so
they've kind of fixed that problem in
Windows it way better with the in win
303 we reviewed previously this one
because the way it's mounted and secured
there's not enough mounting pressure so
the panel wobbles and it also protrude
from the case and isn't flush with the
panel's so it protrudes by about three
or four millimeters and once we
reassemble the whole case here which two
cooler masters credit is incredibly easy
but I would take not falling apart over
easy any day of the week once we
reassemble everything as you'll see in
b-roll and here the case just has an
overhang from the tempered glass where
it's not flush so we've got a couple
millimeters here sticking out from the
rest so that just kind of bothers me
it's borderline nitpick but it's just
like it mitt it makes the panel feel
like there was a last minute like
tempered glass is huge we have to have
it a type of addition I talked to them
tempered glass was apparently always in
the design so it's just kind of an
oversight in that case not impressed not
impressed with how wobbly it is not
impressed with how it secures and mounts
because it does really not secure at all
and really not happy with the fact that
it's not flush like this that's just
kind of you know the argument for your
case is it looks good and then you do
this where where does the argument go it
has to go somewhere else like thermals
and it's not impressive enough to hold
there on its own so a lots of small
things here
another problem GPU clearance is also a
problem so the we talked about this with
the thermal take view 71 pretty heavily
it's only fair that we also do it for
Coolermaster and that problem is if you
have
a MSI gaming X Twin Frozr card an EVGA
FTW an EVGA FTW hybrid and asus rog
Strix ZOTAC extreme series card or any
number of other non reference PCB cards
that have a higher PCB which is probably
50% of the cards we've reviewed in the
last year if not more if you have one of
those taller cards its taller than the
PCIe slot and you install an air cooler
even a small one like this one 20
millimeter cooler they're not gonna fit
together or at least there's a very good
chance they won't unless the air cooler
is pretty damn small so you get away
with a 92 mil but that's about it
so we have this mounted by zip ties
right now because that's the only way it
would work
it will not mount properly because
obviously this is in the way you don't
get a PCIe ribbon cable included and you
buy that separately that's less of a
problem because you don't need a
mounting bracket or anything you just
you can actually mount it into the case
without a bracket that's nice but not if
it's a non reference PCB that's at all
so this works best if you have a
reference cooler or reference PCB rather
not necessarily cooler although you'll
see later that reference cooler is
actually better and works best if you do
open-loop liquid or something like that
which we didn't do but that would have a
smaller height for the video card so
yeah that's kind of it's a lot of a lot
of really disappointing things with this
case and at $150 I haven't mentioned the
price yet that's what it is
however 50 bucks you kind of hope that
they can get some of this stuff right if
not all of it I mean sure Thermaltake
overlooked this problem too
whatever there's plenty of open-loop
options there plenty of reference PCBs
go get one of those but then there's
stuff like the panel mounting just being
bad I mean look at this is that's so
effortless for me to just kind of do
that and it's not necessary at some
point the modularity isn't that required
it's not that needed that the case
should be literally falling apart as I'm
picking it up and yes you can obviously
pick it up without things falling off I
would recommend doing
by grabbing under the power supply oh no
don't do that that's that's actually bad
though don't pick it up that way but now
you grab it under the power supply and
then have your hand under the eye oh so
that's what we need is pay yeah
a guide to how to lift the case up see
ya a bit exaggerated for purposes of
film but I mean really it kinda it is
just this panel should be secured end of
story
so yeah let's go through the thermals
that'll get us through the rest of this
case review see how it does if it
follows the high airflow line at all and
full wrap-up we didn't do anything too
fancy for additional testing this time
just sort of functional vertical GPU
mounting for example and taking the
front panel off to see how much it
limits the cooling potential we plan to
do more testing in the future though
we'll have a comparative data next as
always but we're first starting with
only the H 500 P this will give us a
better understanding as to how the case
performs under various conditions with
the stock configuration and under a
torture workload the H 500 P manages a
CPU Delta temperature of 56 point 1
Celsius over ambiens with idle at around
4 degrees Celsius again over ambient
removing the front panel entirely drops
us down to 42 point seven degrees
constituting the largest drop we've ever
seen from this simple panel removal test
this tells us that the large 200
millimeter fans have a lot more cooling
potential than their being afforded here
this is particularly noticeable as the
resistance caused by the front panel is
quite high and causes the fan rpm to
drop about 50 rpm over the on versus off
test ignoring that aspect though we can
highlight that the front panel mesh
despite being about an inch wide
actually again only exposes less than
half an inch of mesh to the fans the
fans therefore choke on this limited
space and are already challenged in the
static pressure dept as these large fans
often are installing the GPU vertically
drives up a bit more than 1 degree
Celsius in our cpu measurements this is
partly because of the collision chorus
between the CPU tower cooler and the
video card and is not really a realistic
user scenario because you wouldn't be
zip tying a card to your case you'd
probably just buy a smaller one or get a
liquid cooler to account for the
clearance issues we expect this to be
better under conditions of reference
size PCBs comparatively the Coolermaster
age 500 P stock configuration lands at
about 56.1 degrees Celsius CPU load
temperature over ambient positioning it
between the Cullinan enclosure and the
NZXT s340 elite the SD 40 elite is a
case we previously knocked for mediocre
ventilation and so the age 500 PE falls
in that same line despite numerous
references to high airflow in quotes in
the cases reviewed guide and elsewhere
the enclosure offers decidedly less air
flow than the $70 silverstone our l06
positioned at 48 degrees celsius over
ambient or the corsair 5 70 x which is
similarly sized even running at a slower
10 50 rpm fan speed when the case is
capable of more this is even a bit worse
than the internal take view 71 which is
at fifty four point seven degrees
Celsius over ambient the aged 500 P
doesn't impress in the slightest here
but isn't dismal either it's just kind
of okay for any other case that be well
it'd be okay but it's a disappointment
on a case that clearly has the words
high airflow attached to it despite
moving away from that branding
officially moving on to GPU torture
temperatures that the Twin Frozr card
manages fifty-four point nine degrees
Celsius over ambient that's in the stock
configuration this keeps it a couple
degrees away from throttling so it's
actually not too bad when stock removing
the front panel expectedly improves
thermals they're only by five degrees
Celsius for the GPU CPU impact was much
greater a vertical GPU mount suffocates
our dual axial cooler on the card which
is pressed up against the glass and now
has to deal with radiative heat off the
back of the GPU trapped between the CPU
cooler and itself and this results in a
68 degrees all these over ambient
temperature pushing us well past thermal
throttle territory and into frequency
decay now of course this could be
accounted for by blasting the GPU fan
rpm and fixed but then the noise
argument goes out the window you'd be
best off with an open-loop GPU cooler a
hybrid card or a reference card with a
higher rpm comparatively GPU torture
testing lands the cooler master H 500 P
stock configuration at fifty four point
nine degrees Celsius which is just
between the 570 X at its lower 1050 rpm
or again stock 1550 lines at 51 C he and
the be quiet dark base pro
hundred-page 500p is cooling the GPU
about as well as cases that are targeted
at silence at least that's in these
workloads and a lot of that is because
of the power supply shroud which is
limiting air flow to a dual axial fan
couple this with the fact that the GPU
basically aligns with the dead zone on
the 200 millimeter fan despite the
distance from the fan and you end up
with a bit of a warmer video card than
would be desired
we've been on to 3dmark stress testing
which represents a realistic gaming
workload we encounter GPU thermals I'm
about fifty eight point nine degrees
Celsius on the H 500 P right alongside
the $50 spec Oh for an Thermaltake g21
which is 50 to 70 depending on where you
buy it
to its credit CPU thermals are a lot
better here at 30.7 celsius versus 36
and 39 on the two aforementioned cases
this is because the GPU being butted
against cooler brastias PSU shroud is
again limiting the airflow particularly
with that dead zone consideration CPU
thermals position the case between the
KL 0 7 and C 700 PE ultimately testing
blender for a realistic production
application our CPU worker rendering
test positions the H 500 PCBU thermals
as acceptable at about 39 degrees
celsius delta T over ambiens that's
because this test generates less heat
than some of the gaming workloads that's
down to GPU utilization which is 0% in a
CPU worker blender test age 500 P still
isn't impressive but it is in the middle
of the pack and is perfectly acceptable
as for GPU thermals with the GPU worker
in blender where the CPU load is
minimized we are again objectively in
non thermally threatened territory we're
not going to throttle but we're still
middle of the pack age 500 P lands
between the dark base pro 900 once again
and the metruff I see from fractal
surely then the noise should be better
in this case as its larger fans do spin
slower than the Y near fans of 120
millimeter and 140 millimeter sizes and
our standardized noise testing the
cooler master H 500 P lands at 38.7 DB a
system noise so just before the jump
into truly high airflow configurations
that generate 40 DB A+ of noise that
makes the H 500 P about the same an
acoustic performance as the mesh by C
given our configuration with the same
test system and it's really just not
impressive but not bad either so that
pretty much wraps this up the case
isn't the worst case anyone's ever made
it's just that at $150 and with the
amount of hype its received it's pretty
disappointing this is what happened when
a case receives the amount of hype as a
piece of silicon and then the company
ends up going cheap on some of the
components so part of this is cooler
masters attempt to stick to a modular
design they've gone a bit too hard with
it here it's cool to be modular but
there's a reason that basically no one
else does it in the market and while it
would be great for Coolermaster to
capitalize on that empty market they
need to do it in a way that makes people
actually want to buy the modularity and
then trust it and yes the removal of the
panels was a little bit of a problem
it's not the worst thing in the world I
maybe made it seem a little exaggerated
but I mean again the first time you pick
the thing up if you grab by the side of
the front panel at all it genuinely will
just kind of pull off it's it's it's not
the best mounting mechanism but to be
fair it's probably not as bad as we made
it look initially it is about that bad
the first time you work with it though
this panel isn't too much of a problem
you just don't grab it by the back and
it's not going to come off but
ultimately ignoring the panel mounting
issues which I've demonstrated primarily
for cooler masters benefit to try and
convince them to put an alligator clip
somewhere the next issue with the
panel's is just the cheapness and the
creepiness of it as a Creek enos again
it's one of those things were like
you're not gonna sit there and push on
the panel while you're using the system
but it just speaks audibly to the
quality of materials which is not that
high so yeah disappointed in a lot of
ways a wobbly tempered glass panel not
particularly secure there's like a 1/2
millimeter gap between the glass and the
chassis the fans don't get a lot of air
through airflow through the mesh of the
front panel because of how the fans
protrude from the front of the case GPU
clearance doesn't work with taller video
cards and I think that's most of it on
the upside the cable management is
pretty good and I guess it has a look
that a lot of people like so if you like
the case and how it looks we're not
going to tell you to buy something else
because really not much else exists that
looks like this case it's fairly unique
in that aspect and color masters done
well there it's also one hundred fifty
dollars and you need to go into it
knowing that there are some build
quality issues in terms of quality
materials and components but once you
have it built it's gonna look the way it
looks and that's the end of the story
you're not gonna be taking it apart
every day that said some aspects will
always be in your way like the non-flush
side panel and the limited airflow so
you're gonna need to plan for those in
the build but yeah it's just you know
look this is again not as offensively
bad a case as some of the others we've
reviewed in the past it's just that at
this price point at this level of
marketing with these specific language
used with how the case came together
ultimately it's just disappointing and
that's all there is to it so hopefully
the price comes down a bit because that
may be 120 somewhere around there it'd
be reasonably competitive even with the
quality control issues and concerns but
at 150 there's too much good competition
for us to give it a hard recommendation
unless you're buying strictly on looks
alone and that's where it stands so as
