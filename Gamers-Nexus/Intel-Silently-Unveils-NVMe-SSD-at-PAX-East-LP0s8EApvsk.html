nexus Donette we are at the intel booth
at PAX East 2015 just got back from GDC
so now we're here right now we are
looking at a prototype nvme PCIe SSD so
we don't have a ton of the specifics on
this just yet we don't really controller
the type of flash or the flash
manufacturer but we do have a few items
of note first of all this model is
available in 400 gigabytes and there's
also a 1.2 terabyte model planned for
shipping they are considering an 800
gigabyte model but that's not finalized
yet and we know that it's planned for a
first-half 2015 launch so we're getting
near the end of the first quarters are
probably second quarter but it is
targeted at first half and again this is
currently unnamed no controller so all
we know is that it's about four times
four to six times faster than the
standard SATA 3 SSD which tend to peak
at about five hundred fifty megabytes
per second so four times that and it is
nvme and those are sort of coming into
the market just now so brand new
technology still and we will have more
information for you as this progresses
no price just yet and we will keep all
the links in the description below for
more information I will see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
