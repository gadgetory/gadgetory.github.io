at today it's a composite overview of
Vega GPU mounting pressure and here's a
look at why we're testing it when Vega
launched at least two primary modes of
GPU packaging were found across the GPUs
with either raised up molding encasing
the silicon or the absence thereof Tom's
Hardware initially reported that HBM
potentially ran 40 micrometers lower
than the GPU and the initial proposal by
Tom's was that AIB partners may have
more difficulty designing for the
multiple packaging types today we're
testing to see the mounting pressure and
thermal impact from and these various
Vega GPU packages before that this video
is brought to you by thermal Grizzly
makers of the conductor hot liquid metal
that we recently used to drop 20 degrees
off of our coffee leak temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo not and hydronaut pastes
learn more at the link below
just for an explanation of what we're
doing and these Vega GPUs chip and at
least two types of packaging if not
three one of them uses an epoxy resin
that raises to fully encompass the GPU
and HBM to flattening the height and
protecting the inner poser in the
process we found this mounting method on
three of our four Vega 64 referenced
cards
two branded by gigabyte and on loan from
a generous reader and one from Andy as a
press sample the second method is resin
--less assembly which leaves the inner
poser less protected and sort of
recessed from the GPU and HBM this also
means a more topographical contact area
we found this resin 'less method on our
Vega 64 Strix card from Asus and on our
Vega 56 reference card from the initial
press batch our Vega frontier Edition
card used the epoxy resin method of the
first one as did the three Vega 64
reference cards in speaking with board
partners it seems the resin list versus
epoxy packages are not chosen by the
partners and that is basically dependent
on when the batch of chips went out thus
far there is no hard data to suggest
that either package type is superior to
the other they originate from different
factories and so they are inconsistent
in assembly but that's not necessarily
bad we'll be testing that here
our first order of business is to
determine the mounting pressure from the
various coolers with a chemically
reactive contact paper so this paper
turns sort of an off red when it is when
pressure is applied to it from either
side that would be from the cooler and
from obviously the GPU side and this
reacts to show us where there is contact
with the vapor chamber now where this
doesn't really apply is the fact that in
real life you have thermal paste that
sits between the vapor chamber or the
cooler in the case of the asus strix
card and that is what would bridge the
contacts for an imperfect service
between the GPU and the cold plate which
be the imperfect part of the service so
that's something that's not accounted
for in these pressure tests but we'll
look at that a little bit later right
now we're just focused on the variance
in pressure contacting the GPU and
potential differences between the
different packaging types for the
silicon that's what sparked all of this
and then of course the sort of extra
bonus round of that is the variants in
the vapor chambers themselves and
whether these various cylinders within
the chamber will impact the contact in a
meaningful way we're testing a total of
six devices some of these tests will
include swapping coolers between GPUs
which will help determine if limited
mounting contact is more results of the
vapor chamber cooler or of the package
assembly again most of these are done
without thermal paste so keep that in
mind but we do have one that was
conducted with their own paste getting
right into it we'll start with our vega
56 GPU as that provides the most varied
results to quickly understand how this
all works with its stock reference
cooler that came on our sample our vega
56 GPU shows minimal contact with the
vapor chamber for the HB m2 and it's
also got spotty contact for the GPU
proper we can highlight where the HBM
would be Illustrated if it had fuller
contact but on this particular
implementation we're not seeing the HBM
really show through the GPU itself has
some contact to the chamber but
cylindrical shapes appear in each of the
first two
tests this isn't a mistake there are
actually cylindrical columns within
vapor chambers preventing the chambers
from collapsing on themselves this is
normal for all vapor chambers the fact
that we see them here means that there's
a greater contact pressure in the area
from those columns and if there's enough
interest in the comments we may dissect
one of these coolers in a few days
this contact patch overall is
theoretically suboptimal but remember
that thermal compound exists exactly for
this purpose hypothetically the vapor
chamber cooler should outweigh the
negatives of more limited contact area
than a flat cold plate with copper heat
pipes and thermal paste again is meant
to fill those gaps it's just a matter of
whether it does its job and we'll see
soon hpm also has a low heat flux so it
can better get away with less contact
than something like a GPU could here's a
look at our hybrid mod melting from way
back when Vega 56 first got here we
first thought our hybrid model would
have worse contact on the vapor chamber
but repeat tests and improved better
contact with the ASA tech TLC plate
that's on the flow 360 this is because
it's flat to slightly convex with a z'
attack designs and so we see greater
contact with the hpm remember this GPU
is one of the recessed package GPUs
lacking any epoxy resin around the
borders the GPU coverage is also
significantly better with a Vega 56
hybrid mod than with the reference
cooler if we were to superimpose them
for instance moving on the next GPUs are
our three Vega 64 reference cards two of
which were purchased by a reader and are
on loan all three units use the epoxy
resin packaging and so the footprint up
here is much wider than that of the
previous silicon packages this is
because our contact paper is reacting to
the Pennsy and pressure applied by both
the raised epoxy and the silicon and
then the heat sink on the other side and
the two gigabyte branded reference cards
have significantly better HBM coverage
than our previous bake of 56 tests and
have overall better GPU coverage you'll
notice however that the earlier sample
Vegas 64 reference card that we were
sent early in the launch cycle has
poorer contacts when compared to the two
gigabyte units which come from the same
batch as one another to test why this is
we planted our Vega
fifty-six vapor chamber atop the best
Vega 64 in the test labeled as v60 4-1
and found the following it's got much
worse coverage
despite being tested on the exact same
package this indicates a level Natisha
with the Vega 56 vapor chamber in our
model not all of them necessarily but
that there's a quality-control
difference between the vapor chamber
plates this also carries over to our
Vega 64 press sample of the card the
earlier one and for further testing we
took the best Vega 64 cooler that be our
V 64 - one again and stuck it to the
Vega 56 card we now see significantly
better coverage rivaling that of our
hybrid mod the coverage is much better
on the GPU but still lacks for the HBM
we think this may have something to do
with the lower
HBM tube package height as initially
reported by Tom's hardware but we are
not yet fully positive the next test is
our Vega 64 Strix model from Asus in
this one we see the best GPU coverage
we've yet spotted with still lacking HBM
coverage the Strix coldplay is nearly
perfectly flat as it's smooth and
nickel-plated without the supporting
rods of a vapor chamber to get in the
way we think that this correlates with
the recessed package design as our Strix
64 card lacks the epoxy resin of course
this is a sample size of just a few
cards so we have to implore that
correlation of course as an equal
causation but it is a potential finding
what is notable though is that the
cylindrical divots do not appear with
the flat cold blade of the Strix card
which is attributable to its cooler
design that does not inherently mean a
superior cooler has vapor chambers make
up for it in other ways and of course
the Strix has different fans but it is
another potential point of data for when
the Strix undergoes review testing the
final test was conducted on our Vega
front erudition card which we purchased
in the very first round of vega products
this GPU uses an epoxy resin package
just like the three Vega 64 reference
cards unfortunately it also has
similarly poor contact to our early
sample vega 64 and early sample vega 56
again a correlation doesn't equal
causation but a point worth exploring
would be whether the
models like the gigabyte Vegas 64 units
underwent improved quality control for
cooler contact pressure we can't be
certain without more units to test if
you'd like to send them for loan though
tweet at gamers and access to get in
touch for now we can only note that our
Vega frontier Edition card had it more
limited contact
we tried applying thermal compound
underneath the contact paper just to see
if the coverage area appeared improved
but coverage although improves a bit
didn't really look like it worked with
this test it's just not conducive to
working with the pressure paper so we'll
discard that for now let's pull the most
important results and then look at their
thermal behavior this is the best
coverage Vega 64 vapor chamber versus
the worst coverage chamber from our Vega
56 card we've kept the fan the base
plates and the face plate and I've
swapped only the vapor chambers the GPU
is also the same
we have controlled for ambient and apply
to Delta modifier where necessary and
also ran the test multiple times with
power virus burn ins and lower speeds at
about 4700 rpm the Vega 64 vapor chamber
which had fuller coverage keeps us at
around 76 point four degrees on the GPU
ninety-five point two on the GPU hotspot
and eighty-two point three on the HBM
temperature reading swapping the vega 56
chamber onto the card we end up with a
GPU temperature that is about one degree
lower more or less within variants along
with hotspot temperatures that are 0.7
degrees different with invariant a
hotspot temperature again is not
appreciably different but the HBM
temperature is it's a full three degrees
higher with the Vega 56 chamber which
again had worse contact and is outside
of variance and is repeatable bringing
the comparison shop back up on the
screen you can see why there's such a
difference on the HBM temperature
fortunately an extra three degrees won't
hurt anyone
there's definitely quality control
variants here but we're not running
significantly hotter than the cooler
already operates just for parity here's
a frequency chart to demonstrate that
the tests operated at the same
frequencies we can also show GPU only
power which plots the cards as consuming
equal amounts of power for each test so
the takeaway here there's a few of them
one is that yes there are different
types of packages and they do impact how
the cooler contacts
the silicon but that's primarily because
there's fuller contact with the raised
epoxy resin packages because they
contact more of the cooler so that's
potentially somewhat beneficial to the
the ability to dissipate that heat as we
saw in some testing but it's not a huge
difference ultimately you're talking
maybe a couple degrees at most and
that's just not appreciable because the
Vega cooler is already bad enough that
it's just it's not gonna make a
difference you're already in the 80s for
HBM so going from 81 to 83 at 4700 rpm
and an ambient of about 20 degrees is
just not important what is noteworthy is
that of course buying the AV partner
cards will not guarantee anything we
spoke to them about this and the abbey
partners as far as everyone we've spoken
to is aware have no ability to say to
Andi we want the resin list package or
we want the resin package so it's kind
of luck of the draw based on when the
batch was run and to whom it was sold as
for other items of note thermal paste
basically makes up for the poor contact
of something like this this is the Vega
56 unit which had among the worst
contact out of all of our tested units
and it seems to be more indicative of a
quality control issue with the vapor
chamber more so than the GP packaging
that said the resin list packages did
consistently show worse HBM coverage
towards the top part of the hbm's in the
middle of the entire package than with
the resin packages so that's another
item of note and basically corroborates
what Tom's Hardware was saying closer to
launch now does it matter as far as
thrown performance
it doesn't appear like it really does
but it also that could potentially
depend a bit on the cooler type but for
these not really the AV partners that
have the flat cold plates like this one
should get better contact than the vapor
chamber because it doesn't have the
cylindrical bars in it which is a normal
thing to have in a vapor chamber however
the vapor chamber is able to partially
make up for the contact area by just
being a vapor chamber then again the
blower reference cards suck on NVIDIA
and Andy devices and that's for reasons
other than just the cold blade and the
heatsink so yeah that's the data kind of
cool stuff not hugely impactful to how
you use the device or how it performs
necessarily what is noteworthy one more
time though is that if you open these up
and reseal them make sure you really
tighten it down to spec and make sure
there's thermal paste in there because
it's gonna matter but that's all for now
