just officially ratified the Vulcan API
1 point 0 specification and that's big
news for the development industry
especially as it pertains to games the
API is our application program
interfaces are used as a gateway between
the hardware and the game itself and
they interface with the OS as well so
they are very important and actually not
something you can bypass in the process
of developing a modern game so most
games as many of you know run on some
form of DirectX whether that's 11 or
maybe 12 in the near future or OpenGL
and Vulcan is a an adaptation of OpenGL
it is the future of OpenGL it was
previously called OpenGL next that has
been renamed it is not Vulcan and Vulcan
also consumed a major part of the AMD
mantle project which had very similar
objectives and that is to bring the
coder closer to the hardware so they're
going lower level this is something
you'll see widespread through engines as
they adopt these newer api's and enable
developers to get somewhat direct access
to the hardware so that is very good
because it allows the bypassing of a cpu
bottleneck by pushing several items like
draw calls geometric draw calls from the
cpu to the GPU and that reduces the
bottleneck that reduces workload on the
cpu and it moves things over to a
parallel processor instead so the news
today d Vulkan API one point 0
specification has been ratified that
means it is basically finalized and the
development can move forward AMD is
pushing out a beta driver for Vulcan
support so I don't I think this should
hit today it is not clear it wasn't made
clear in the press release that we got
yesterday but the beta driver should be
available pretty immediately for
developers who want to begin working
with Vulcan and in terms of games that
immediately support it the only one
we're told of is the Talos principle so
that game will have Vulkan API support
immediately from what I understand what
I've been told I don't know whether the
driver and the game will work how it'll
work with toggling things but of course
as the driver rolls out we will
immediately begin testing and see what
we can find out with
vulcan in the Talos principle and other
relevant games in terms of games the
near future AMD didn't have a list for
us that we could publicly produce just
yet but I can tell you that from a
previous interview of ours with CI G's
chris Roberts the star citizen team is
looking at Vulcan very seriously and
it's something that they might adopt as
they move outward from the DirectX 12
adoption that they're performing right
now they're adapting that to the
CryEngine and that is still in
conjunction with directx 11
optimizations for star citizen so those
are the two major games that in the
somewhat future for star citizen
immediate future for Talos that support
Vulcan you can hopefully duck down with
the driver pretty immediately and the
spec is finalizing you look that up of
your developer or if you're just a
curious person in the industry and find
out what exactly that means and how it
differs from DirectX 12 so that's the
big news for today check out the link in
the description below for the article on
this news item if you want to learn a
bit more and we've got some other videos
on a channel search for DirectX 12 and
you'll find a couple videos especially
with chris Roberts if you want to learn
more about the CI g star citizen
endeavor with api's so that is all for
this time it subscribe if you like the
content hit the patreon link going to
help us out directly and thank you for
watching I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
