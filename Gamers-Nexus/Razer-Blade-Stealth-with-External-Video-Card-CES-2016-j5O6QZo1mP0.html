access net and we're here still at the
AMD suite or booth at CES 2016 looking
at the new razor blade stuff laptop with
its external GPU enclosure and that's
sort of the big deal here so first of
all the CES 2016 coverage is brought to
you by high powers revolt two small
form-factor gaming PC getting back to
the laptop the big thing here is the
external enclosure we've seen this
before with the Silverstone I believe
what's called the sgo to a couple of
years ago now and that was just a case
that was pretty early in the days of
external GPU now we have things like the
alienware setup that's that was Sean
last year it's been out for a while and
the thing with the alienware setup is it
uses a proprietary connector so you
really have to use it with their laptop
with the way this is set up the razor
stealth blade plus the external
enclosure as we've looked at here today
the enclosure is actually hot swappable
so that's the big news you can just
unplug or connect the GPU externally as
needed and then disconnect it when
you're ready to go so there's no
shutdown required as has been required
with some other external displays and
that is done very similarly to the way
that an external hard drive or USB
device would be connected and
disconnected just using the windows
interface what we know about the specs
offhand is that this is using the
Thunderbolt three-point o interface
which is actually a 40 gigabit per
second interface the equivalent of about
a PCIe x4 or so slot and just from
talking to Andy we haven't personally or
internally validated this ourselves but
will do so in the future from speaking
with Andy the external enclosure at the
x4 equivalent PCIe laning performs about
6% slower than by 16 set up so it's
really not a big hit considering the
portability but obviously the big deal
here is always priced when you're
looking at is this sort of setup
actually worth it versus building more
portable computers and I don't know the
price of the external enclosure just yet
for the GPUs I know the laptop started a
thousand dollars for the razor blade
stealth units specifically but you
should be able to just plug the
enclosure into anything that's Thunder
ball three point 0 enabled and run with
it from there so the display system is
running an r 9 nano right now the laptop
is on an i7 6500
with 8 gigabytes of RAM it's a 0.5 to
inch thickness so basically an ultrabook
even though Intel no longer calls at
that and that's all we know for this
right now but check the length
description below for more information
that hit the previous AMD video that we
just did on the Polaris GPU architecture
versus the GTX 950 thanks for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
