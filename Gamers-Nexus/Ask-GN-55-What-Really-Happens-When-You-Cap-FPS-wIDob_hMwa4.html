you can leave your questions in the
comment section below for next episode
or if you're a patreon backer on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus you can
post your question in the discord chat
where I try to read them every week so
this we've got a couple interesting
topics on game performance and FPS
capping what happens to your extra
frames when you cap the FPS as one of
the actually really good questions maybe
without even intentionally doing so the
user inspired a lot of discussion behind
the scenes but before getting to all
that this is brought to you by EVGA s at
CLC 280 liquid cooler 4 CPUs which we
previously benchmarked and found to be a
high performer given its relative
silence the temperature output learn
more about this $140 cooler at the link
in the description below the first
question is an interesting
behind-the-scenes topic from our video
where we updated the render rig I don't
want to point this one out in video
format answered it a bit in the comments
but a couple people asked or suggested
switching software from Adobe premier to
something else
sometimes there are more expensive
sometimes they are less expensive
sometimes there are interim solutions
and a lot of people seem focused on the
cost of the software but as an
interesting point from a business
perspective or a business owners
perspective I wanted to highlight here
that do wait c'mere first of all is
incredibly powerful it does a whole lot
of stuff really well and we know how to
use it that's the big thing it doesn't
do something as well like hardware level
optimization for instance it could
certainly be better there some of its
competition is better there but the
thing is for us we could do something
like learn an entirely new program which
isn't free its if I ignore the cost of
program I have staffing and personnel
cost we have to train up people to do
the video editing in that software I'm
probably not gonna have time to learn it
which is potentially problematic because
I'll no longer be in a position to offer
any kind of additional hands-on if
needed but more importantly there's a
time cost and a training cost for
learning the new software and there's a
good chance it won't really do anything
more for us than premier does other than
potentially render faster and so here's
our
we're the business side of it comes in
for something like that if I'm looking
at I can improve my render performance
CPU bottleneck side by just throwing
more hardware at a box and spending some
more money and being done with it that's
what I'm going to do it might cost me
500 more dollars or a thousand more
dollars they can cost me 1500 more
dollars to build a system that will
render significantly faster but that's a
one-time insignificant cost compared to
buying new software learning how to use
it ourselves which is a sort of snowball
effect cost because now not only do you
not know how to use the software and
your team doesn't know how to use it so
you have to pay for their time your time
to learn how to use it you also pay
indirectly by having a slower content
pipeline now all the predictions about
how long it takes to do something wrong
so that's a problem as well so no we're
not going to switch software Adobe
Premiere is really good it's just not
that optimized for certain types of
rendering that we happen to do but the
solution is to throw more hardware at it
and that's something that we're fully
capable of fortunately that is kind of
that's where our business is focused so
this is very fortunate for us because
unlike other businesses where they might
not be as Hardware driven as we are
we're able to solve the problem pretty
much overnight or within minutes a lot
of time so that's why we're still using
premier and it is good software it's
just it's really easy to make fun of
ports I don't know if lack of
optimization is really the correct way
to say it but disappointing level of
optimization maybe is so that was one
thing I want to point out same thing for
one of the other questions which was
from a madhouse woola Willard Willard
who said for your big rendering task why
do you not use the Linux kernel you may
find a significant performance boost
with a blender same thing there you only
have two resources really time and money
and only one of those can you get more
of so if we can just kind of spend more
money to do things faster that's fine
Linux we used to build the web server so
not a foreigner to Linux but also
Windows is already installed on all the
machines of that render took 20 hours so
why optimize it when it's
you let it sit overnight and it's done
anyway there's no real point in spending
time screwing around with an environment
that we're not really familiar with
enough to do efficiently and confidently
the first time you're really just better
off doing what you know if it's going to
be a one-off quick project because those
animations we only have to render them
once and then they're done fortunately
so let's get into the next questions the
real ones that are off topic of GN and
back onto Hardware this was the really
good one that I was excited about
answering and I sent out some requests
for assistance and understanding the
best way to answer this but I will get
to that in a moment
scooby-dooby I believe on discord asked
Steve what is the correlation if any
between high FPS fps highs excuse me and
FPS lows specifically as they relate to
CPU or GPU performance and even more
specifically to i-5 like in GTA 5 ask
because I found in my personal
experience that limiting the maximum
frame rate in the game I can eliminate
game-breaking FPS lows and have a smooth
experience I've often wondered but
haven't tested what the effect would be
to ignore or sorry to average FPS by
limiting the maximum fps in such an
instance would it be possible to have a
net gain of average FPS by limiting max
FPS so we've got a whole separate sheet
for this because it required some
thought some conversations and I spoke
to Tom Peterson from Nvidia about this a
little bit because this is a topic that
is he's pretty experienced in having
worked on things like the frame phasing
testing back in the day with the first
version of FCAT and then more recently
with F cat VR so good resource there but
I just to break down the question the
way I read this basically boils down to
what happens to the extra frames when we
cap ourselves 60 or 100 FPS might be
your cap and if you do that do you just
deliver the first 60 frames in the
second that the hardware is capable of
rendering or do you pace it out and
deliver the 60 frames evenly spaced from
one another so that you get a smoother
experience
and says scooby-dooby suggested so
that's the question and there are three
ways to cap Fame rate in the game so the
two main ones are known vsync you cap it
just by turning on vsync and now you're
locked to the refresh rate of your
monitor and that one's it's a monitor
back pressure that we've talked about in
the past when g-sync and fries Inc were
really hot topics the next one is by
game engine throttles which are getting
a lot more common lately so you can find
one of these in dota 2 dota 2 has a
default limit of 240 off caps overwatch
has an FPS limiter as well I think goes
to 303 or 300 battlefield one has an FPS
limiter a lot of these games do that's a
game engine throttle and then you can do
GPU driver based frame caps through the
api's and the end Nvidia both have some
level of driver side frame rate cap or
frame pacing and videos uses the env API
so that means that it can plug into
afterburner or precision as well so you
may have a third party solution that can
cap your frame rate and that is done
through the NBA P I in their situation
or Andy has their own tools as well
so doesn't you remain three ways to
limit the frame rate in a game vsync is
a solution that gates the drain rate of
the CPU so the CPU render thread runs
vsync slows down the rate at which you
present frames the back buffer in the
GPU will sit with a completed frame
until it's time to deliver that frame
which will be on the monitor refresh
interval for some terminology the front
buffer and back buffer are both address
spaces on the physical memory on the
video card comprising the frame buffer
and they flip their pointers when it's
time to present or the specific present
call that is made once a frame is ready
the back buffer contains the final
completed image and that's what you
eventually see where it gets interesting
is the game engine level throttling so
in this instance the main loop of the
game engine encounters a CPU pause and
that CPU pause delays the start of
simulation for the next frame and that
happens on a specific CPU thread for the
game the game thread or the simulation
thread more
civically whereas your other threads
might be something like the render
thread and the render thread is
responsible for feeding these shapes and
the objects to the GPU for being drawn
later so that would be the render thread
that's one of the busiest threads in a
game and is where you get your draw
calls out of so the simulation threads
what we're mostly interested here and
that is largely responsible for the
progression and pacing of animation
frame the frame so we care a lot about
what that's doing and when it is doing
it let's say we impose a frame rate
limit of 60 FPS on the game engine not
using vsync but using the game engine
limiter with a 60 FPS limit we're not
going to be delivering frames more
frequently than once every 16 point 67
milliseconds the game frame rate
throttle uses this pacing to determine
its animation progression so at the
beginning of the loop the CPU checks the
current time against the time of the
last frame delivery which is output as a
delta T or delta time this delta T is
used to determine whether it's time to
go back and work or whether the CPU
simulation thread can remain idle the CG
render thread is still doing work during
this and is responsible for supplying
parameters for shapes to the GPU that it
ultimately draws the game FPS caps are
the front of the pipeline so the
simulation thread waits until the
desired delta T value is reflected
simulation happens before rendering does
and paces our animation a 60 FPS cap is
a frame every sixteen point six seven
milliseconds 120 fps is roughly every
8.3 milliseconds and so on and you can
calculate this simply by dividing 1,000
milliseconds that is by the desired
frame rate and that's output in
milliseconds
during this idle time for the CPU game
simulation thread we're not spinning up
and spewing frames out at the frame
buffer or front buffer back buffer for
storage what's happening is rather than
generate a bunch of excess frames that
get discarded we're generating fewer
frames overall and just meeting the cap
as long as the hardware can keep up
which is a big assumption here that's
necessary for talking through this so
only the appropriate amount of work is
being done for each frame this is why in
some instances you will see power
reduction power consumption lowers
because you're limiting the amount of
frames going out that makes sense but
more importantly and fitting with the
user's question
you'll see a smoother experience as long
as you're able to hit that limit 60 FPS
for example because in this case you're
not really worrying about all the extra
fingers anymore you're not just spitting
out as many frames as it can be
generated
instead it's one every sixteen point six
seven milliseconds or whatever it may be
and then you sit idle as the CPU
simulation thread and wait for time to
draw the next frame so provided the
hardware can keep up with the frame rate
target the results should be a fairly
smooth experience with minimal tearing
since the game engine or vsync engine
will more or less create a back pressure
to limit the frame output so now your
average FPS shouldn't really be higher
necessarily by capping the frame rate it
is possible depending on the behavior of
the particular game and the GPU
certainly if it's working
hard enough and there's some driver
level issue or something like that you
may encounter an occasional frame where
you've got a spike of 500 milliseconds
or something really awful and experience
ruining but generally that shouldn't be
happening so overall your average FPS
shouldn't really be higher for the most
part however you might actually see
better frame latencies or more
consistent frame rate these are frame
times as we call them because your
interval interval between frames will
now be consistent based on the frame
rate cap that you've set in the game if
it's 60 it'll be every 16 point 67
milliseconds there will be no more and
no fewer as long as you keep up so be
smoother looking overall as an
alternative solutions like fast sync or
something like that try to pick the best
frames by eliminating tearing but
keeping the higher frame rate that's a
completely different topic and you've
got adaptive sync technologies that are
hardware driven g-sync or in the
attributes of a monitor like free sync
which is B blank and those do a little
bit different way because you're not
relying on a game engine to do the work
you rely on other variable to do the
work but that should pretty much set the
stage for the question the fantastic
question
I love having to go out and find answers
from people in the industry and this one
deserves some extra work so thank you
for that one let's move on to the next
question the next question is from sir
papa on YouTube who asked question
connects sgn in your previous video you
talked about using three GPS for
rendering does the CPU even matter at
that point when all of the workload is
on the GPUs for the most part the answer
is no not really
as long as the CPU is able to keep up
enough to perform basic instructions and
commands and keep the GPUs tasks with
work you're going to be fine so in that
particular video we were looking at a
blender render and the only way that the
CPU would really be useful in that
specific case aside from basic tasking
of the commands would be if you were to
render another set of frames on the CPU
for example you render frames one to 30
on the GPUs and maybe frames 31 to 35 on
the CPU just because it's going to do it
a whole lot slower so why give it an
equivalent amount of work but that's
really the only place that comes into
play with that particular workload now
this changes based on what you're doing
of course with premiere for example you
really not going to accelerate more with
more GPUs as we've found so the Seabee
does actually still do a ton of work in
premiere but depending on the type of
stuff you're rendering if you can kuta
accelerate a lot of it or OpenCL
accelerate a lot of it you really take
the emphasis off of the CPU for
something like 1080p 60 ABC HD encoding
with limited CPU related work loads from
effects you end up with a CUDA or OpenCL
acceleration where the CPU becomes a
whole lot less relevant to the point
where and some of our testing we've
shown with an i-5 and CUDA you can
render something as quickly as an i-9
7900 X and CUDA or a rise in CPU and
CUDA all of those were 20 minutes in
that particular workload it just depends
on what you're doing though some stuff
is more CPU bound than others this next
one was another one I had to go out and
seek some thoughts from manufacturers
your wolfs then gave me and said I guess
there's a more question for case
manufacturers but I was wondering if you
knew why case manufacturing companies
fax on fantastic aim a few seemingly
have almost what could be described as
random color choices for the cases while
simultaneously ditching the colors at
other points that people really like I'm
aware that it may cost them more paint
wise so why not give us the option for a
slightly higher cost you know like
fan tax into pro cases did where white
was $10 more than the black variant so
this was an interesting question as well
first of all color is pretty hard to do
black is easy because it's well one it's
a really safe color you know it'll sell
because most of the cases are either
black or white so if you do black or
white you're going to fit in with the
in-crowd you're probably going to really
not be limited on sales by color you'll
be limited on sales by design or
something like that but hopefully you've
gotten right the next thing is even with
the white case it's really hard to get
that color correct so when you have
different materials like plastic one
type of plastic versus a steel it's
difficult to match them and that will
really show up in the right or the wrong
light when you're looking at the case to
the point where when we've gotten
pre-production samples sometimes the
tone of the white or the tone of the
generally non black colored cases Gray's
fall into this as well will show a
difference when you look at the metal
side panel versus the plastic top so
that's a challenge and I'd cost money to
fix a couple notes from the
manufacturers we spoke to one of them
was a pretty good point that said
tooling shipping inventory all that
comes into play and a lot of people may
not realize that which is definitely
true
inventory is a big cost that's not
really factored in here and then there's
a risk of manufacturers choosing a color
that retail channels just might not want
to carry maybe Micro Center or Fry's or
Best Buy or whoever doesn't want that
color case because they don't think
their audience will buy it and what
happens sits in a warehouse forever
perpetually as retailers online might
take the cases with more interest but
they still assume some risk with it if
it's not just a standard black or white
that they know will sell and then the
next thing is the buyers who actually
are responsible for purchasing the
product that goes through the retail
channels they're called buyers at the
websites Newegg Amazon Fry's ncx
any of them if those buyers don't think
that the case will have a good run rate
they'll basically just not buy it
end of story so now you're left with the
thing
your shelves in the warehouse where
you've got another SKU an inventory that
you have to track and more physical
space the product like in cases takes up
a ton of space that sits there and eats
cost just by way of sitting there
another point brought up was some of the
if manufacturers feel like their run
rate will cover the cost of producing
the item they'll make it or might have a
certain SKU that's already done well so
they know that there's a demand for a
certain color and that's where you get
companies reproducing the same color
over and over because they know it will
sell well to their audience
manufacturers can drop the margins to as
the the run grows as you produce more
product of the same design or color so
the example given to me was if you have
a cooler like the cooler master hyper
212 where they've ordered nearly or over
a million samples at this point and they
know it's going to keep selling your
your margins go up because you can
produce a lot more and lower your cost
it's really it's the same with pretty
much all level manufacturing even just
making these shirts like we make the
cost scales with the amount that you
produce because if you think about it
from the manufacturers perspective
whether that's a factory or a shirt
printer the people in charge of that
assembly line or production line have a
set-up cost it costs in our instance it
cost the shirt printer a certain amount
of money and time to get the screen
ready a silk screen or to get staff on
hand to worry about logistics and once
that cost is out of the way you worry
about producing the product so the more
you can produce Perron and get that
startup cost consumed by the amount of
products being produced by using the
line for longer because you're using
that startup time for longer and the
lower the cost is to make the product so
the point of saying all that is talking
about just adding a few dollars for
color might not be enough you might be
talking something like a 50% increase to
make a color customizer on a website
where a user can pick green or blue or
red or yellow or really any color so the
cost can go up astronomically once you
start doing stuff like that and they
really want to limit it to
one two maybe three colors and at that
point why straight from stuff that you
know will sell that's the hard part is
as always the point you have to make as
a designer or something like that is you
know if we make this thing and we take
the risk of the extra color it's really
got to be unique enough and we have to
drive it enough and marketing to make
sure it moves off the shelves so that's
a that's the main set of questions a
couple more quick ones black tower four
or black tower asked four days ago
I would appreciate the zotac 1080 TI
thermal pad and backplate mod video
guide thanks yen there's not a lot to
say so you basically if you watch our
teardown you'll see how to take the card
apart once you take it apart find the
place where that little rubber bumper is
remove it and get thrown pads that are
the appropriate height to put in there
I'm not sure exactly what the height is
because I had to send that card back but
I think we used a 0.5 millimeter and a
1.0 millimeter surround pad and that
made contact really pretty easy though
tag is on record on their own subreddit
saying that they would honor warranties
if you did that as long as you restore
it to its factory condition before you
send it back so you're not going to void
the warranty by doing that mod according
to them directly on their own subreddit
next quick question was a Clayton Fife
who said Verizon 1,700 acts with Beats
you hit the tomahawk should I trust
rising masters 76 Celsius or CPU 10 and
a hardware monitor when I was sick
Celsius when overclocking there within 5
C stock it's hard to trust any software
with dermals for any CPU with Intel we
have to spend a lot of time just looking
at the different tools and figuring out
which one we trust the most and
sometimes that's easiest done by putting
a shim in there and measuring that with
a thermocouple and comparing the numbers
for AMD I'm still not positive which
ones trust you would think rise and
master would be pretty accurate because
it is the AMD solution however I found
hardware info 64 the one of the most if
not the most accurate tools for working
with rising processors this was a
software solution recommended to me
originally by Andes tech marketing team
so we started using it and it has a
measure in
internment in there called T die that's
the one you want and you can go off of
that for your readings so I think that's
pretty much it the only other thing to
say is as always leave questions in the
comments section below stay tuned for
all the coverage this week and go to
gamers access squarespace.com to pick up
a shirt like this one you're wondering
about them now that we've talked about
shirt processing as part of a case color
selection and as always subscribe for
