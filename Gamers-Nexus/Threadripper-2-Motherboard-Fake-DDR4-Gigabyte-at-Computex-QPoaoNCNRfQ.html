gigabytes headquarters now looking at a
good amount of new products actually one
of them that I want to point out
immediately is the new X 399 motherboard
for AMD not Intel and then a B 450
motherboard for AMD not Intel anyone
else is getting those confused we'll
talk about other motherboards later but
for now these two are new and
interesting and then also the gigabytes
trying to make a push somewhat in memory
a couple of other adjacent spaces like
power supplies so we'll go through a few
of these before the show starts and I
think we'll have a couple more things to
talk about later on before that this
video is brought to you by Thermal
Grizzlies high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal Grizzlies cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below so let's start
with the X 399 motherboard this is a
pretty high on board and there's a
reason for it but basically X 3 de9 has
been out for a while now it's not
inherently exciting there is thread
reporter around the corner we already
know publicly August is roughly the
release timing and they will almost
certainly have announcements this week
there are rumors online about 24 cores
there are rumors about 32 as well but I
don't know what'll happen with that
so either way adding more cores is going
to impact the power consumption it is
going to impact the vrm requirements so
it makes sense to have new X 399
motherboards this one has copper heat
sinks on it actually for the vrm
components so that's a bit different
it's not entirely necessary to have
copper typically normally don't get a
huge difference thermally or it's just
irrelevant this might be a little
different just because here's the thing
you look at this motherboard every
single square millimeter on this board
is filled with something so you start
running out of room to just add more
phases to spread the heat over a wider
surface area the only solution to that
is more active or passive cooling or
extra of the two because there's
physically no more space for a bigger
vrm and so you're left with either
really be v-power stages and they
already have some pretty high-end ones
on here so I think this board is running
in an IR 3/5 201 pwm which is pretty
standard actually they have a 3/5 204 as
well not familiar with that one yet but
we'll look into it and then 35:56 for
the power stages which are 50 amp power
stages there are 10 of them and so I
think it's a 10 plus 3v RM design but in
addition to that basically the the
solution here thermally is a bunch of
fins and they're copper and nickel
plated and shiny and then underneath
here there are going to be two fans I
think eventually so it should be too
small fans under there to help with
dissipation and also back here there's
another small heatsink and it's just an
aluminum sink that's sticking up it's
pretty wide more like macro fins and
micro fins and that is for a 10 gigabyte
Ethernet controller and so that thing I
think is pronounced a quanta not
positive on it but it's a 10 Gigabit
Ethernet controller and they have two
additional Ethernet ports on here one
gigabit ethernet so they're three total
ones ten gigabit and it's controlled via
standalone controller as opposed to just
straight off the chipset or something
like that kind of interesting especially
for production pcs like X 399 because
you're dealing with potentially
environments like ours we're moving
gigantic files back and forth across an
ass internally or something along those
lines so that's the basics of the board
still ECC registered memory all that
stuff is not really changed from thread
Ripper to specs that we've talked about
thus far and other videos on the channel
and I think everything else is more or
less what you see is what you get I
guess I'll point out the PCIe assignment
so sixteen eight sixteen eight for that
and then the rest is you have some M
about two ports and things like that a
couple of smaller points here there's a
six pin for PCIe on this side there is
integrated i/o shield that we've talked
about in the past and then RGB LEDs
pretty much everywhere except they're
more tasteful this time they're digital
RGB LEDs and I don't there are actually
not any in the memory slots or the PCIe
slots the backplate has some interesting
light into it as well though on this
side and then finally
this you may not have seen before so on
the EPS 12-volt connectors those are
plated with metal as well on the outside
probably more of a looks thing than
anything it fits with the rest of the
board I suppose not going to get
anything like structural rigidity or
anything like that but it looks wise I
guess that's what they're going for so
that's X 399 I think that pretty much
covers that board we can talk about beef
450 now this is an AMD product and I'm
gonna take a very brief tangent here and
say if Intel and AMD one of them could
grow up and stop coffee and the other
that would be fantastic because be 450
be 460 be 360 be 370 whatever be 350
rather H 370z 370z to 290 Z 490 all of
these things that we've talked about in
the past getting really annoying to keep
up with so maybe some different names
before 50 though it's gonna be AMD's and
this board is pretty straightforward so
for the vrm on this one there's an inner
cell is l9 five seven one two for the
PWM and for the drivers its is l6 six
two five a we'll talk about this more
with Bill joy later SOC is running one
high one low and a DDR MOSFETs one high
to low for that there's an integrated
i/o shield on this one as well for a
mainstream board that's a bit different
and noteworthy and this one's called the
B 450 or s Pro Wi-Fi quick note here on
these things the naming is gonna change
for gigabyte so this board is called the
extreme and this one is not really
anything anything related to the
previous names but three five seven are
the gaming brands that we've kind of
come to know with gigabyte seven being
high-end and nine sometimes so that's
changing to extreme and some other
things we'll talk about later but
basically three five seven probably
going away at least in the next round of
motherboards obviously not for the
existing round so that's noteworthy but
it's just a marketing rebrand anything
more than anything it's for memory for
this show so gigabyte has RGB memory not
inherently exciting to do either of
those two things they are doing
something a bit different though first
all guaranteed B die which I guess is
noteworthy there's a thirty-two hundred
megahertz kit and one of these two
sticks is fake so what they are do
and this is interesting given the
current memory market is supplying kits
of four-ish it's really two plus tiers
so there's two real sticks and then two
fake ones and the dummies are still they
look exactly like the real sticks but
internally you're not getting act any
actual memory dyes on them the point
being that you can populate all four
slots if you want to do that if OCD is
kicking in or something you really want
four slots populate or you think it
looks better with RGB LEDs and you can
do that with some fake sticks as well
and it shouldn't really impact price a
whole lot the I guess the other side of
things is that from gigabytes
perspective they can more or less
guarantee that their memories gonna work
with their motherboards that's been a
bit of a problem with actually risin and
until lately so that's part of a
marketing play as well but for the
memory basically all you need to know is
one of them is fake in this kit which is
actually kind of cool because memory is
expensive enough we're buying four
sticks is difficult right now so it's a
bit different it's all the most exciting
thing in the world I get it but just to
preempt the comments you got to give
someone credit for doing something
different with memory other than putting
Novak fluid in it which is I suppose
equally pointless wrong performance
standpoint but at least this one doesn't
look horrible so yeah that's that's more
or less gigabytes set up for Computex
they have a set of power spikes coming
out as well ap 850 GM is the one next to
me right here I think G stands for gold
and M stands are modular don't know a
whole lot about it we'll find out more
at a later date but that's it for now xD
99 extreme is the one to look out for
the B 450 pro Wi-Fi board is coming for
mainstream and the processors as well
