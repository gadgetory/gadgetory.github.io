battlefield one story line it seems
there might be one more optimization
guideposts in the words but for now
we've got to get back to regular
component reviews
today's topic though looks at memory
frequency and its impact on bf1
performance particularly frame rates and
we briefly look at capacity and
utilization but will primarily be
focusing on speed before getting to that
this content is brought to you by Rose
Wells : encase which is a tempered glass
side panel case also tempered glass in
the front available for $150 on new
agate now they occasionally do bundle it
with a 650 watt PSU as well so be sure
to check the link below for more info on
that we've been through battlefield one
a few times now first was the GPU
benchmark looks at the video card
performance and then after that HBO
versus ssao graphics settings
performance in game and then most
recently we did the CPU comparison for
benchmarks and dx11 dx12 today we're
looking at Ram methodology remains
mostly the same but there are a couple
of critical changes we define all of it
in the article in from the description
below these results are not necessarily
directly comparable to the previous test
because one we're changing memory here
and that's obviously the focus of the
tests we've overclocked the CPU running
a 60 700k overclocked and the game has
been updated which also had some at
least marginal performance impact mostly
positive and then we're also using
different video drivers so those things
stated this is a new test looking
strictly at Ram but if you're interested
in the others they will be linked in the
description below we're using two
primary platforms for this test the i7
6700 K with an MSI m7z 170 motherboard
will be our main platform with the 6700
K overclock does 4.4 gigahertz memory
used is at 32 gigabytes of course
there's Dominator Platinum ddr4 easily
capable of speeds up to 30 200 megahertz
with its first XMP and we manually tune
the speeds and BIOS before each of the
tests then run six to eight passes per
device DirectX 11 will be the focus for
the test since we've already shown that
dx12 has some optimization issues with
battlefield one that will sort of
override any lacking memory performance
and we did do a few dx12 tests but
they're pretty brief the GPU used was
our EVGA 1080
FTW hybrids so we don't have much in the
way of bottlenecks when operating at
1080p and with ultra settings the most
likely components the choke will be the
CPU and the RAM the point here is to
show scaling of memory so keep in mind
that as resolution increases we begin to
see more taxing the performance from the
GPU and that is more directly related to
FPS than memory at that point so
frequency becomes a bit less relevant as
the resolution increases let's get to it
this first chart shows battlefield one's
memory performance and running 1080p
with ultra settings on the test platform
the main one and we're seeing largely
unfettered performance with the four
sticks of 3200 mega Hertz corsair
dominator Platinum memory pushing a 161
FPS average about 128 one percent lows
and 117 fps 0.1% blows this is followed
next by the ddr4 2,400 memory so we've
clocked down the Platinum Series kit to
2400 megahertz
that's at 158 FPS average or about four
fps behind the 3200 mega Hertz kit with
it lows at 118 and 107 fps a step down
with 1600 megahertz ddr4 memory which
basically doesn't exist and does poor
access times anyway we're at 150 FPS
average now 11 fps lower than the 3200
mega Hertz kit and now again no one's
really buying 1600 megahertz memory and
ddr4 kits but it was a worthwhile test
if we create another unlikely scenario
1333 mega Hertz memory that's operating
at 140 FPS average that's a full 20 FPS
lower than the 3200 mega Hertz kit this
could be compared in some ways the
single channel performance if you
remember our video from ages ago we
didn't see much impact from multi
channel platforms with ddr3 and our
Gaming tests a couple years back but
game development has changed and so has
memory with single channel platforms
memory speeds are effectively halved
from the advertised rate so these 1333
and 1600 results give a look into single
channel performance with bf 1 and as a
quick PSA keep in mind that there's no
such thing as quote unquote dual channel
memory or single channel memory the
memory itself is not in charge of how
many channels there are it's the
platform
here's a chart showing percent scaling
as offset from ddr4 2400 verse
a fairly standard 20 400 megahertz kit
of ddr4 memory we're seen scaling of
about 2.5 percent gains when moving to
3,200 bag Hertz and we're seeing losses
of about 5 percent when stepping down to
1600 megahertz and the jump from 2400 to
1333 is about 12 percent again remember
that as we begin restricting performance
through other variables like increasing
the resolution basically taxing the GPU
more taxing the CPU more the memory
impact will become less significant it's
a small part of the performance overall
but it is actually showing a change
which is cool it's not really that
common but when we increase resolution
is something like 4k which is maybe more
appropriate for a 1080 ftw these results
do vary to the point that with 4k
resolution ultra settings were basically
seen zero scaling with memory at 32
hundred megahertz versus 1866 megahertz
not a big difference there in
performance I think we were seeing about
67 FPS average for both tests both the
x11 only variable changes the memory and
that's just because the GPU is getting
taxed so heavily by the rest of the
stuff in the pipeline like the increased
pixel throughput that the memory becomes
less relevant so keep that in mind but
we're still seeing some scaling which
again is a cool thing now dx12 also
shows almost no scaling from memory
changes even at 1080p and that's because
the game performance is too erratic
already from poorly optimized dx12 so
we're not seeing
I shouldn't say dx12 poorly optimized
it's battlefield one is poorly optimized
on dx12 it's all in the developers hands
for the most part and it's just too
spotty and erratic to see a meaningful
gain from memory changes alone just for
good measure and to cover another
architecture let's throw AMD's FX 83-70
into the mix here we've tested memory at
21 33 megahertz and 1600 megahertz all
ddr3 kits and we can see a difference of
about 5.5 to 6 fps in the average
framerate performance between the two
that's about 6 percent change
considering that ddr3 kits are priced
pretty equally between 1600 1866 and 20
133 megahertz these days especially with
manufacturers basically dropping 1600
from production entirely it makes sense
to spend the extra $1 for something
that's 6% faster
use-case and at this point it's actually
a meaningful change because we're
limited down to around ninety eighty FPS
anyway it also makes sense to run two
sticks for battlefield one if operating
on a dual-channel platform especially
with these lower end CPUs as for
capacity this is harder to measure for a
number of reasons memory isn't instantly
saturated so it's easier to test with
something more heuristic we tried
playing a 64 person multiplayer match
for about 40 minutes while running
logging utilities to track system memory
consumption and checking res Mon for
commit memory versus working set of
memory memory usage by the application
goes up quickly but the working set of
active memory being used by the game the
application never exceeded six to seven
gigabytes even when I had 32 gigabytes
in the system we played with one stick
of eight gigabytes of RAM as well just
for another 64 player match and that was
done to see if any visible stutters or
popping issues occurred and the answer
was no not really we just still see the
popping issues that are normally there
but nothing exaggerated by the memory
change and it's all the same as what
you'd normally see with battlefield one
nothing specific to memory so the
capacity seems like you'd want
definitely eight gigabytes but the only
immediate gain from having a larger
capacity of memory is if you want to run
background applications like Chrome or
something like that that eats memory for
its tabs and not have to close them so
that's it for this benchmark this one's
pretty simple memory has a bigger impact
in battlefield 1 than we've seen with
other games and that's always a cool
thing it's something that we can use for
memory benchmarking in the future and
even something we can use for SSD
benchmarking because this is one of the
things I haven't talked about yet in any
of these videos SSDs in battlefield 1
actually make a pretty noticeable
difference especially when loading
multiplayer maps the change from using
one of our nvme SSDs to using a low-end
SSD alone is fairly substantial and
putting it on a hard drive would would
definitely be noticeable but in terms of
memory we are seeing a difference with
the lower end CPUs it's definitely
probably more critical that you actually
just spend the extra one or two or five
dollars to get memory that jumps from
1600 to 2133 megahertz
if you're on in ddr3 because that price
is not bad couple bucks and there's
actually a meaningful change now
with this particular game again five to
six percent between those two numbers
1621 33 so that is significant capacity
just recapping that quickly it pushes
the 8 gigabyte barrier of the game but
it's never really even when just testing
it heuristic aliy playing the game
properly for 40 minutes or so we're not
seeing any worst performance that's
visible other than the framerate
performance as I've already described
for the frequencies we're not seeing any
performance degradation just from the
capacity change that we don't already
see somewhere else like 32 gigabytes of
RAM so memory is not a huge deal in
terms of capacity you probably want a
bit more if you do tend to keep a lot of
applications of the background 16
gigabytes isn't a bad idea but it is
plenty for this game if you're just
playing the game and killing everything
else in the background so that's all for
