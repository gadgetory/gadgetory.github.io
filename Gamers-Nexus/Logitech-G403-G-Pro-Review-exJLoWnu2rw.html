gaglianone where we talk about some new
Logitech mice the G 403 and the G Pro
I've been spending a lot of time with
these mice and I love both of them quite
a lot so I'm looking forward to talking
about the specifics yeah so Mike's can
go through the human factor stuff to
shape the usability in games things like
that I'll talk about the technical
specifications how the buttons and the
fulcrum in the switch work all that
stuff before getting to that this
content is brought to you by AMD and
they're affordable free sync monitors
like the $390 LG 34 um 68 p huge amount
of letters and numbers ultra wide IPS
display learn more about that in the
link in the description below let's
recap the hardware specs first the G 403
and G Pro are both $70 mice though the G
403 has a wireless alternative for $100
that we'll talk about later the mice use
the pmw 3366 sensor including zero mouse
smoothing and zero speed related
accuracy variance or that's commonly
called acceleration the G Pro and G 403
are effectively the same mouse aside
from shape so when we talk about the G
403 really we're talking about both of
them except for these shape we'll get to
that later the internal specs are the
same each Mouse has two thumb buttons a
dpi button LMB RMB and a middle mouse
button which opt out of the Logitech
hyper scroll wheel and instead uses a
mechanical scroll tracking wheel instead
of the optomechanical tracking they've
used in the G 900 and the proteus core
Mouse the G 403 also has an optional 10
grams of weight the g43
weighs in an eighty seven grams
unweighted it's 124 millimeters long 68
millimeters wide and 43 millimeters tall
this makes it a bit larger than the G
Pro which measures in at 116 millimeters
long thirty-eight point two millimeters
tall and 62 point one five millimeters
wide the G pro weighs in at 83 grams
without the cable making it a few grams
lighter than the 403 the most direct
competition to these mice would be the
Zowie FK one it's been around since
probably about 2013 now the SteelSeries
sensei and razors DeathAdder one of the
most prolific mice on the market courser
is m65 for a newer alternative and then
there's a logitech's own go3 as
to the G 403 in fact the G Pro is a
fusion of the G 303 and G 100 designs in
terms of me chassis and the buttons
which were borrowed from the G 303 so
that's the hard data the specifications
but of course doesn't really impact how
the mouse is used so that's why I've got
Mike here mike is an avid FPS gamer
got quite a bit of time in the
Battlefield series yeah I've been
playing a lot of battlefield 1 and I've
been putting the 403 through its paces
it's got a right-handed organ Amish ape
the shape of this mouse is sleek to say
the least
logitech has to RGB spots one in the
logo and a small ring around the scroll
wheel that you can light up and
customize this makes it fairly
understated compared to most of the
peripherals we see these days with all
their RGB LED options and all the
lighting all the customizing and
over-the-top buttons and exposed
hardware this this mouse is looks like a
single piece when you look at it from
afar so it's it's got a real sleek
mature look right yeah it's a little
more professional in that regard like
not not professional gamer although they
did title the G Pro because it was built
with pro gamers professional eyes in you
I guess the idea is you can bring this
into an office environment right now
look like a tool yeah the the look is
definitely matured compared to what
we've been seeing lately I do wish the
thumb buttons on the 403 were positioned
a little bit more forward on the body I
found that I really had to strain to get
the back button which I normally use as
like a sprint button so that was
something that I noticed personally what
about the coating the service material
the surface material is great on both of
them both of the top coatings for both
of these mice have is it's like a
plastic but it's a matte finish and it
really repels grime and sweat and all
the stuff nastiness yeah and I I'm kind
of in middle of the range with that I
get my hands get a little sweaty after a
lot of gaming and that's something I
definitely appreciate is a good nice
surface that room that was that was a
combo with the mx518
which I think you use yeah I've owned
both the 5:18 and SteelSeries sensei
both
those have a gloss top finish yeah they
just collect dirt and sweat and it's
gross yeah I got a clean I had to clean
my mouth all the time yes these are a
little better with that I've been using
the G 900 for several months now since
we reviewed it in May
that's this it's really not collected a
bunch of garbage so they this is the
same coating material as these so it
holds up pretty well it doesn't get as
grimy and nasty as like the G the mx518
or the g5 used to and one thing that is
different between these two mice is that
the 403 has a rubberized side to it that
I absolutely love in fact I really wish
that the whole Mouse have this texture
on it because it's sticky it cleans
easily and it just provides a real
positive grip whenever I'm swiping left
and right the G Pro has kind of a harder
plastic finish to it I almost would have
been happy if they took the surface
material from the top and put it all the
way around the mouse as well but this
one kind of slipped out of my hand a few
times and I'm also smaller it is smaller
so the sizes definitely had been became
an issue for me I'm really used to these
bigger mice that that fit into my hand
really fill up the grip that I use right
and I kind of use somewhere between a
palm and a claw grip but this mouse when
I got it settled in the back of my hand
I found my fingers were landing really
far forward on the mouse which led to a
couple accidental clicks right
throughout one evening of gaming with my
friends they weren't too pleased about
that
yeah alerting these zombies of your
location yeah we're so we're playing
h1z1 yeah it didn't go well but with the
403 it fits in really well and my
fingers fall right into the center of
the buttons for Mouse one and two which
is a lot and that's that's a good
opportunity to talk about how the
buttons work so with Logitech G 403 and
G Pro they have a similar a sort of
modified spring tension system as to
what you found in the G 900 and the
difference is basically the G 900 uses a
mechanical pivot and so that pivot will
have an image of it too that you'll be
able to see more clearly what's going on
but there's a steel bar that sits atop a
fulcrum and that bar rotates to
accommodate the key press so with the G
900 which is 100
fifty dollar Mouse that we basically
said is the best mouse we've used but
also $150 when you push the buttons
anywhere on the key plate it's pretty
linear in terms of how you perceive the
actuation of the user the G 900 has a
pre travel spring to keep tension on the
switch and a PCB mounted at an angle so
that the clicks are perpendicular to
input it's not a sort of sheer input
that you don't want the G 403 changes
this as does the G pro again basically
the same mouse other than the exterior
neither has the pre travel spring
keeping tension on the switch and
neither has the steel pivot bar for the
fulcrum so instead the G 403 and G pro
use plastic deformation elements that
connect the key plate from the housing
of the mouse and deform on button-press
this is less sophisticated than the G
900 and we don't think it has as even a
distribution of force across the key
plate but it also works better than some
competing mice the Death Adder for
instance razors mouse has a key plate
that can flex under load because the key
plate is acting as that deformable
element is receiving all of your force
Logitech is moving that deformation to
an internal plastic fulcrum which helps
keep the force fairly linear across the
key plate and reduce accidental clicks
well this goes back to what we talked
about earlier with the hand positioning
on such a small Mouse it really pushes
your fingers farther forward on the
mouse 1 &amp;amp; 2 surface which can lead to
accidental clicks anyway before getting
to the conclusion here let's take a
moment to jump to the g4 3 wireless
architecture because there is a 403
option so basically the 403 wired is $70
a 403 Wireless $100 g4 3 wireless uses
the same architecture as the G 900 chaos
spectrum maps that we praised previously
the G 900 review by the way is linked in
the description below and there's a lot
more diagrams and science behind this if
you want to get the depth on the
information for Wireless but I'll recap
the basics here the G 403 has a
radiation pattern that is dispersed in a
fairly uniform circle around the mouse
with an 8 decibel milliwatts max power
the closest competitor to this that we
are aware of is the SteelSeries sensei
Wireless which tests that negative 1 DBM
signal strength that makes a lot of text
Zhi 403 and G 900 some of the most
powerful wireless mice
on the market and that's useful and high
noise environments where there's a lot
of RF interference like a LAN game and
event or pax or something similar you'd
be able to get away with using the 4/3
Wireless without a cable connection from
the floor of a LAN event and would be
able to do so with a battery life of
approximately 20 to 24 hours run to die
with the lights enabled and again
there's a lot more of that in the G 900
article so if you want to learn more
about the interference and click latency
testing hit that article probably one of
the only slights against these mice is
neither of them have adjustable lift
lift off which for 60 to 70 dollars I
really think you should have that
feature it's something I really like and
it's a feature I notice when it doesn't
go right for me it normally manifests
itself as the mouse stops reading too
soon so I'll be doing a big swipe left
or right and I won't turn as far as I
thought and not being able to adjust
that for my mouse is a pretty big
negative but I didn't have any problems
with either of these guys a lift off
distance yeah yeah lift off is a pretty
interesting problem to solve too there's
not an option to tune that as you said
in the LGS software which which probably
mentioned is really at a top-level LGS
works pretty well and yeah a lot more
that you think I've had no problems the
Logitech software works great and it
does what it's supposed to and you don't
think about it which is the way that
software should be right yeah it's not
too aggressive or invasive but there's
RGB synchronization with your other
Logitech devices if you have them but
like I was saying there's no lift off
adjustment in there there is however a
surface tuning option so this uses sort
of a takes of white balance basically it
looks at the surface of whatever you're
mouthing on the mounting surface the
mouse pad or otherwise and that
optimizes how the sensor responds to the
surface and that's again the pmw 3366
sensor it's in most of the mice Logitech
makes currently today so it works well
it's not like just a gimmicky marketing
thing now I don't think you need the
surface tuning but it's not just
complete BS either you actually do yeah
and it might compensate if you got a
really dirty mouse pad all right at
might you know the software might come
with presets for what your mouse pad
might have been like when it was new but
if it's real dirty and
you do that surface tune it might
increase actor yeah that's something I
haven't tested either just like just get
it terrible but we're freshening all the
time so yes of course
so conclusion what do we think about
this I guess we should mention as well
there is a weight in the G 4 there is
one weight and I've got to say it's the
most clever weight at my favourite
weight system I've ever seen in a mouse
because it really simplifies it for me
it takes the guesswork out of what I
want you either have the weight in or
you don't it's magnetic and it just
comes out and goes back in incredibly
easy there's no trays or containers that
you have to squeeze and yeah yeah it's
one extra piece for the mouse and it
it's it's just clever I like it it's
sleek yeah if you wanted it to be closer
to 107 grams or something like that or
100 grams I suppose would be the depends
on if you if you weight with or without
a cable and you have the weight but to
me I don't really feel that much of a
difference these days I generally play
without the weights and the mice I take
all the weights out as well yeah but if
I guess we wanted the extra weight it's
there so in terms of usability it the
mice work as you'd expect the sensing is
accurate the sensors are positioned
pretty much in the middle of the mice
there's a difference between these two I
suppose right yeah so the G 403 is more
centred or forward and the G pro is
slightly back from the centre it
definitely sits farther back when I got
a grip on both of the mice that I found
that the sensor on the G Pro definitely
sat farther back in my palm which for me
was kind of a negative because I like
the sensor to be up towards my thumb
where I can really take advantage of
wrist movement right that makes sense
yeah yeah so competition what we have
out there these are $70 the wireless
ones 100 let's kind of ignore that for a
moment versus these quarters I'm 65
you've tried yep that's like a $50 Mouse
non RGB yeah that one was one of the
ones like I said it's kind of immature
in its look and that was a kind of a big
negative for me and it has you know the
the DPI switch button which I still
haven't found a real good use fluid I'd
rather just switch between the two DPI's
I like the sniper button right the
sniper button then there's the Zoe FK I
haven't had a chance to try that yet but
my friends who have them speak really
highly of them and then there's the
SteelSeries sensei which I used for
about three to four years until it
started to fail on
and that that Mouse was fantastic sets
the glossy surface yes that would be one
of the direct competitors is sensei I'm
mod to tech side if you wanted similar
stuff to look at the g502 proteus core
is about what is it $70 these days I
think $70 I got ball I just bought one
and I got mine for $70 but now I'm kind
of looking at this 4:03 thinking I might
have made a mistake
so yeah the 502 might be worth looking
at if you wanted something a little
heavier more traditional it is it's
quite a bit different in terms of the
physical feel and look and the G 303 if
you wanted something more similar to
these but for 50 dollars instead of 70
that's what I look at and I'm like you
said Zoe's a good competitor sensei
forum from SteelSeries and the courts RM
65 we look at as well so I think that
pretty much recaps it those are the new
Logitech mice the wireless one it
competes against more or less the same
things that Wireless sensei would be the
competition there there's not a lot of
good wireless mice out these days razer
has a few Ouroboros is Wireless as well
but this is kind of the cane of them
right now and that's 150 bucks haha as
always patreon like the post roll video
to help us out directly links in the
description below for more information
and we'll see you all next time see ya
today I'm joined by Mike gaglianone to
review some Logitech mice the G 403 and
the G pro Mike has gone I'm good
somebody I'm ready to talk about some
mice man that you've I've put a lot
about it I'm Italian these mice they
feel good we got that click noise we've
got our decibel test you're
recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
