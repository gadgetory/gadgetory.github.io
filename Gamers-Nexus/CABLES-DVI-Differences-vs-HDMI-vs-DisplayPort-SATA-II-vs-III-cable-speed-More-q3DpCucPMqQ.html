access Tana and I am joined by a
hardware editor Patrick stone alone and
today we're talking about cables we have
a lot of freaking cables on the table
here we got some video cables some data
cables some Ethernet even fiber over
here everyone needs a little bit of
fiber in their day have a pretty crazy
power cable I want to talk about we have
a secret cable and I'm giving away
something I think it's gonna be a game I
don't know I'll mention it in the
comments below I want to give you
something if you can identify this we'll
talk about that at the end and then we
have some legacy junk over here so
starting with display Intel and AMD set
their phasing out support for legacy
connectors in 2015
still DVI is used every day in our lives
so DVI is still important we have a lot
of different types of DVI yeah what we
got here to begin with is a small dvi-d
single link cable the way you can tell a
D is that you're going to see a little
slot here in the connector that's that's
your DVI D which is digital stuff
there's also a dual link if you look at
the two connect two cables here you can
see that the cable flyes is tremendously
different and that fat yeah fat right
exactly and this guy that can carry more
bandwidth because it's got two links
dual link and that produces the better
images the other types of DVS you're
going to run into are one like this
right here is the DVI a which is the
analog you can tell analog because it's
missing a bunch of pins inside and DVI -
I is analog and digital together so
that's going to have a whole bunch of
pins in there 24 pins on this side then
the bar and then four pins around it and
just to quickly mention DVI dual link
there there are a lot of fake dual link
cables out there we did a video on this
previously hid in the side bar or
wherever it is on YouTube I don't
understand YouTube anymore
it's somewhere on this space hit that
link and we show you how to test for a
fake DVI duelling cable yeah and so the
the other thing that I would like to say
again is if you're going to go say like
at 2560 by 1440 resolution or higher
then you're probably gonna want to go
with that dual link cable technically
the dual link cable cannot perform hdmi
1.4 but that's a really technical
difference and for all practical
purposes it's about the same so moving
to hdmi and displayport
in terms of the the technical difference
between hdmi 2.0 and display for one
point two they're pretty much capable of
the same thing so they both do a 4k
resolution they both output at 60 Hertz
and I guess there's a difference in the
color depth hdmi 2.0 is a little bit
it's like 24 bits per pixel or something
like that versus DisplayPort yeah is 30
that's right so if you really care I
guess maybe if you have super eyes you
can tell the difference other than that
DisplayPort does have slightly higher
bandwidth DisplayPort also is important
in AMD Eyefinity setups that is required
absolutely
so that is if you're buying video cards
or monitors do you keep that in mind
otherwise ACMI 2.0 and DisplayPort are
they're both pretty darn good at what
they do now HDMI 1.4 though the thing to
know about 1.4 HDMI 1.4 is that it can
only do the 4k at 30 frames per second
so be aware of that if you're looking
for HDMI yeah
so before we move into data connectors
with we have SATA different types of
SATA connectors I just wanted to point
out this stupid creation this is an HDMI
to VGA converter if I have that correct
and it is so we've got a digital signal
here and analog over here that doesn't
work it does not work if you plug this
in it will not work do not buy this and
they sell it they sell it if you want
you can buy it if it has like a
converter box on or some kind of
something to switch the signal then
it'll probably work but the cable alone
will not do anything so moving it to
SATA I guess the thing we want to
address here there are two primary types
of SATA cables as advertised on the
market they advertise them as six
gigabits per second or SATA 3 or three
gigabits per second or SATA two so yeah
so the thing to realize here is if you
look on the web for hey is there a
difference between a SATA 3 cable versus
a SATA 2 cable what you're going to find
is the answer if you dig far enough is
nope definitely not but some of you
could notice the SATA 3 or SATA version
3 SATA 6 gigabits per second standard of
cable does say that you have to have a
little clip on top here in summary
though
SATA connectors don't pay extra for
a six gigabits per second connector
unless you really want the clip but you
go so other than that we have a bunch of
USB it's over USB connectors we
basically have USB a and B B is the
square we have USB micro which is the
smallest and USB mini which is used for
cameras and stuff like that and then we
have of course USB 3.0 and 3.1 so USB
3.0 is always identified with a blue
header that is for devices and for
cables and and the header itself is
shown here as well this is what you
connect your front panel for in your
case if your motherboard supports it but
USB 3.0 transfers at four point eight
gigabits per second and the new USB 3.1
standard is at ten gigabits per second
and it can also plug it in both ways so
it is a universal header that way it
doesn't require a hundred tries to plug
it in anymore uh Thunderbolt I should
mention Thunderbolt we don't have any
cables here for none sorry guys there
was a silverstone video i did where you
can see it and use and thunderbolt one
moves at ten gigabits per second but
it's it's like a parallel thing and then
thunderbolt 2 is 20 gigabits per second
which is pretty awesome if you want to
do an external video card oh yeah and uh
I guess we'll move over here
very quickly to fan connected fan
connectors so yeah so the thing I think
about fan games does know is that there
are two types that you're interested in
a 3-pin which looks kind of like this
right here and then a 4-pin which looks
like this right here on a three pin what
you've got is got a ground a 12-volt
connection and then a fan tachometer
connection and that's just going to tell
your motherboard how fast the fans
spinning
what's added in a four pin is a fan
control now which means that the
motherboard or the bios or somewhere in
your software and Windows or Linux can
actually control the speed of the fan as
as you have a higher powered set up that
maybe needs more fan power finally we
have this crazy power connector I want
to talk about if you look at the end of
it it looks like a unimpressed face I
will do so that is an unimpressed bass
note on the and what's special here is
it is a sixteen it's cable
delivering 16 amps so that's just a lot
of current on a standard power cable
you're probably not going to be
delivering 16 amps for instance put it
like this a power breaker that's in your
home's power circuit to your room if I
going to run 10 amps and so this thing
can actually pull more current than a
circuit breakers used to producing like
other words if you pull 16 amps off of
your computer's power supply in a room
that has a 10 amp breaker that breakers
going to flip in a hurry some rooms do
have 15 amps some rooms have 20 amps so
you want to have a pretty beefy power
setup in the room where your plug in
this joker in yeah and that goes with
any power supply that's like 1500 watts
or more because a lot of us homes hit
the wall at 1500 watts
before you start blowing things up so
finally we have this special connector
we've got some zoom in on on it for you
if you can identify this for me if you
got maybe a little bit of history behind
you then huh you're old that's one way
to put it um leave a comment below on
this video I won't count it if it's not
on this video leave a comment on this
video tell me what it is the first
person to get it correct well you know
I'll message you and we'll send you like
a game or something I think actually I
have some wizard wars codes if you like
magicka I'll look it up it's a pretty
crazy just like hectic co-op game I will
send you a wizard wars code if you can
identify this connector so that's it for
our cable video anything else here leave
a question we will get to you with the
second video we'll try to answer it yeah
and as always please subscribe check out
our patreon page and we will see you all
next time peace literal</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
