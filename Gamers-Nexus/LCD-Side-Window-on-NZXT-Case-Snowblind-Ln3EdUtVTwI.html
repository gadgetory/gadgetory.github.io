day of the show first video of the show
I am here with an eye by power system at
the Intel booth that we just spotted
this has been on demo before but we
haven't done a video of it this is the
snow blind so the interesting thing here
it's not a production system yet anyway
and obviously it's got an LCD panel on
the side for the side window in place of
an acrylic window the LCD panel is clear
so the LCD itself you can see through
and behind it is actually the effective
backlight so rather than using what you
would normally find in a monitor
backlight they're using LEDs internally
in the system to backlight the panel and
that's how we're getting this video
playback here the video is actually just
on the desktop behind me there's a video
file called use this video to done
before
that's what's playing here so they're
just playing back a video from the host
system onto the panel and that's what
you're getting now one plan that I would
power was telling me they're planning to
do in the future is to basically make
this a dynamic element so it would
effectively be an extension of the
display through normal windows control
and to that regard you would be able to
actually put something like a control
software on here like NZXT cam or
something like that increase the
contrast a really high contrast that you
can monitor things like temperatures fps
whatever you want to monitor and again
it would basically be monitored number
two now in terms of cost production
things like that this isn't currently
something that is targeted at consumers
like us like you guys for the most part
but for vendors that's sort of the main
target right now is people who want this
on display at booths that shows like
packs and who wants to show off whatever
their advertisement is on the system
side from an eSports perspective this is
also interesting because obviously
there's a lot of sponsors and
advertisers and eSports you can see
something like an ad playing on the side
of systems at an eSports event between
competitors things like that so a pretty
interesting just from a technology
standpoint purely it is the snowblind
internally it's an extreme series Intel
processor the video card clearly has
been modified to the top back plate of
the video card is a mirror to finish and
that's what you're seeing here and then
the rest of it's basically all white
components and that's by design that's
because they want the contrast
there for the panel to work so that's it
for the high-power snowblind system be

check back for other packs of west to
2016 content thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
