dotnet and today we're looking at the
Corsair link 4.0 software update to
their fan and component control suite
and all the CES 2016 coverage is brought
to you by I by powers revolt - a small
form-factor gaming PC looking at the new
corsair link 4.0 utility up until now
link has been generally of sort of
questionable stability or resource
consumption as have most of these
software utilities including cam and
other options out there logitech and
everyone's got their own tool for
managing system components and the link
tool is used specifically for managing i
suffixed products like the h 100 i HX i
paris pi and similar devices and now
link 4.0 has an entirely new code base
so system resource consumption is
reportedly effectively negligible this
is something will validate independently
once we're back from CES but that is
what we're told now the user interface
is completely redesigned and much more
user friendly you can go through the
interface and first of all crashing if
any of you had crashing issues is
largely resolved on link 4.0 but as you
tab through the interface you'll be able
to see the specific temperature levels
depicted visually on a case so you can
actually change the case image of what's
represented in course rate link if you
change the image you can drag and drop
the CPU temperature on to the CPU
location GPU the temperature GPU
location and so forth you can also
create custom fan curves for all the PWM
enabled fans anything connected to
either the motherboard or a corsair i
series product is controllable through
this software so that's a quick look at
link 4.0 we've got an article on the web
already you can hit that in the
description below for more information
and again once we get back will validate
test and do a proper write-up of the
full utility it will become available in
January so that's this month obviously
for owners of relevant products who want
to play around with the door if you just
want to do general pw p WM fan control
type stuff so that is coming out soon
right now it's in beta or alpha and
thank you for watching if you want to
