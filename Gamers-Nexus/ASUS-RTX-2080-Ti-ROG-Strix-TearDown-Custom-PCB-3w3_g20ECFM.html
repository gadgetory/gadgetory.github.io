ice tricks video card and for that we
will need some tweezers a Philips
screwdriver and an anti-static wrist
strap but this is just so it doesn't get
lost
just to clarify those are the new tips
and tricks I learned from The Verge so
anyway this is the first teardown we've
done in a long time
this is an ACS 20 80 TI Strix finally
getting back into the swing of things
with video cards really looking forward
to it we'll have a lot of these coming
up soon so this card today is is one of
the first that we'll be working on it
just arrived and they have several
changes to it over the 10 atti Strix
which actually was one of the best
performing cards in our benchmarks for
the 1080 is primarily for noise
normalize thermals and we'll see if they
can keep that crown with this card and
the first step of that is taking a look
at what's inside before that this video
is brought to you by thermal Grizzly's
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal Grizzly's cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below so here are the
two cards this is the 1080 TI Strix on
my right and the 28 e TI Strix on my
left they are overall the same for ID
but different in some of their other
things here like the fans so the fans
now have flow straighteners around the
perimeter on the 28 80 TI Strix which
and I think the 20 80 as well so if flow
is straightener in theory it'll keep the
air a bit more directed straight down so
there's less turbulent airflow out to
the sides as it spins how well that
works will see in testing we don't
actually know yet of course wait till we
can test it to buy anything but that's
one of the the primary differences in
the cooling design other than the fact
that the 2080 Ti and the 2080 are
significantly fatter than the 10 80 TI
version and that is because they moved
to a 2.7 slot design on the twenty
series cards
with a much more substantial aluminum
thin stack and that is to deal with the
more substantial power output of the 20
Series card so that's a big change as
well other than that some small things
so Asus used to have this trick of
putting a sticker a card so that they
could comply with Nvidia's rules of
getting nvidia branding on there but
also allow the user to remove it if they
wanted to and nvidia caught on so that
rule no longer broken or bypassed by
issues unfortunately if you wanted to
get rid of the Nvidia branding this
support beam has also been strengthened
quite a bit so it should help reduce sag
of course this isn't something we'll
actually know about for quite a while
because it takes a while for cards to to
slowly sag in tone apart but it is
structurally resilient to it and that's
something we'll look at later and then
other than that we'll start taking apart
in a moment but a couple of things on
the outside there is a performance and a
quiet mode toggle right here and we have
some stats on where the fan speeds will
probably fall for that but we'll save
that for the review and going towards
the back side is going to be performance
just if you're wondering has to eight
pin connectors NVIDIA has new power
balancing that should draw more even
power out of each of these rather than
leaning more heavily on one and that's
something that happened with Pascal and
has changed with touring in general for
all the Turing cards and then on the
back they've got an LED on/off switch
which I think the marketing word for
that is stealth switch if you wanted to
use their marketing language so that's
the outside of the card let's start
taking it apart this one should be
pretty easy it's got a total of six
screws on the backside so first four
screws just go straight into the large
aluminum block and the fin stack rather
it should still have a copper nickel
plated copper cold plate on it we'll
find out in a moment but otherwise all
the fins are aluminum then we have these
two just for support structure screwing
into the base plate on the other side
and we'll look at that in a moment too
and in the back all of these can stay in
for now but we do need to take out
probably that one moment there actually
we'll have to take out that one once we
remove the base plate but we can leave
all these in for now those are for the
base plate removal at this point it
should be a process
just pulling this thing up probably yes
so some thermal paste tension but we got
it and this is something I do like about
the card already so some of the cards
like EVGA is taking them apart this
isn't a big deal it's not to cite in
fact when you buy stuff but fan headers
that are vertical into the board and
also have really short cables or kind of
problematic because you get it a quarter
of an inch off the card and then have to
disconnect cables this one it just flips
open which is really nice and the power
connectors have an actual push release
latch on it which is not standard so we
have broken these in the past not the
push release ones but the more
standardized power connectors and that's
not a problem here okay so for the card
itself we'll go over the power design in
a moment but for now you can see the
base plate setup is pretty plain and
simple it's just a big structural bar on
the sides to help with sag that screws
in separately through the rear i/o and
with screws all around the top plate so
that will be the next to be removed we
have a direct contact aluminum base
plate with the memory modules here
that's connected via thermal pads and
then the GPU itself contacting of course
the cold plate which is nickel plated
copper if you were wondering and that
has several these are they look to be
six millimeter heat pipes that will
double check in a second and those are
going through the body so one two three
four five six six six millimeter heat
pipes going through not all of them
emerge the other side to go to the the
rest of the fins but some of them do and
you can see it splits between the
different fin stacks which are isolated
in the center so then we have contact
with the MOSFETs and small parts around
the MOSFETs one thing you'll notice in a
moment there are actually no doublers on
this card so that's different for this
generation and something you'll see a
lot more from Nvidia EVGA and other
vendors they are moving away from
traditional doublers and going with just
a different pwm approach to the power
phases and power stages for the cool
other than having a flow straightener
around the sides of the fans which it's
gonna be difficult to test how much that
does what we can try it is fatter so you
can see it's pretty hefty at 2.7 slots
this is going to be the new trend for a
lot of these turning cards at least in
the TI series just for dealing with that
280 ish watts of heat coming off the
card so that is something we'll see more
of including from EVGA it's time to take
the base plate off though so we can
start with the screws in the base plate
there are one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten it looks like if
you're keeping track so four screw
tracking just to keep it simple make
sure it's all the screws go back where
they should we're just gonna move them
over to our grid on the mod mat if you
haven't seen one of these before it's on
store that game was Nexus dotnet you can
pick one up they should be on backorder
but they're coming back in to us this
week so they'll be back in stock soon
for anyone who back orders them and we
only have a few left here oh there's one
more 11
so there's a hidden screw in the bottom
left over here my bottom left
orientation okay so we've got all those
out the back plates free and next we
have to loosen the i/o screws but let's
get this led off first so for the back
plate there is no no contact via thermal
pads it's actually no contact really at
all it is primarily aesthetic for this
one although it is aluminum but it has a
bit of a plating on it so know if
they're on pad contact not really doing
any work for you in terms of cooling it
does have that LED strip on there if
that's what you're interested in and now
we just need a couple more screws to get
the base plate free okay so we've got
two more in here smaller screwdriver for
this one down near the USB type-c VR
port that's never going to be used and
then one that's kind of stuck and free
spinning because it doesn't seem like
it's fully caught on threads so we'll
just start pulling it apart see if there
we go
okay some pressure helps okay so some
outward force got that one free and
suppose it was free spinning because it
was just caught on the part that's not
threaded there but not a big deal okay
baseplate should be free and so is the
IO cover okay there we go
pretty clean pretty clean card to take
apart alright so here's what we have for
the PCB we'll talk about all the power
components in a moment but let's go with
the layout first for layout the vrm is
split between two sides which is
actually a bit it's really their only
option here because they have such a
large vrm it wouldn't fit on a PCB
otherwise so they have part of the vcore
VR I'm over here part of the vcore vrm
over here and then a memory VR em up
here there's a three phase memory it is
these top three MOSFETs and chokes going
for the V mm v RM we'll talk about V
core momentarily for memory layout
you'll see that there are 11 modules so
we have 2 4 6 8 10 11 and that is
because we have an 11 gigabyte card so
you end up with one gigabyte per module
there's a missing module and part of
this will explain once we get the throw
and paste off here the name on the GPU
actually indicates which died which
memory or memory module rather is
missing from the card because it's not
the same on all of them but it will be
the same for each identifier so let's
clean that off and figure out which one
it is so we had some spill over here
some of these cards are hand done to pay
on when they well the cards aren't hand
done but some parts of the cards are
hand applied like potentially thermal
paste depending on when they came out of
the factory and that's just because it's
still so early but we've cleaned off
enough to reveal the GPU text and can do
some more cleanup later before
reassembly but we also know what they're
all pasted internal pads asus is using
so the thermal pads at least for the
primary vrm thermal pad it is a 3 watt
per meter Kelvin thermal pad if they're
all pay
is TC 502 6 Dow Corning and that is the
same vendor that Intel and other
companies use a lot of them use Dow
Corning for their thermal paste supplies
that's what that is
so this thermal paste is a non curing
compound it should last for a long time
even with exposure to high heat and dust
potentially it is also a two point eight
seven or roughly three watt per meter
Kelvin thermal paste not too abnormal
for this kind of component either we see
a lot of 3 watt per meter Kelvin thermal
paste on CPU coolers from a stack as
well there's a closer to for Intel uses
closer to four or something like that so
that's what they were working with now
the GPU itself let's look at the
labeling this is a tu 102 it's the first
production tu 102 that we've worked with
everything else is done pre production
so this one is tu 102 300 a that's the
name of the GPU there maybe later a 280
or something like that because this is
actually not the biggest touring GPU
they can make it's it's the biggest in
terms of dye size but there's an
additional four SMS that are disabled on
here so they could have another 256
cores 4 times 64 would you get you 256
more floating-point units so we may see
a 200 a or a 400 a later but maybe 400 a
for some smaller card typically go down
a number for a larger card so tu 100 to
300 a k1 is the signifier for which of
these is missing as we understand it now
we don't have enough samples to confirm
that but there is the one missing memory
module here and as I understand it today
that corresponds to the k1 part of the
name if you're wondering what that means
so we might see a k2 or maybe that one's
missing instead or something like that
we don't know why they do that we don't
know if it has to do with the memory
controller or what but that's how that's
what the name means then a1 is just the
revision so this is the first revision
that's all that is the vrm asus is using
an MP 2 8 8 8 pwm controller with a
switching frequency of 1600 kilohertz
the PWM mode they are using they're
using PWM 10 mode for 16 phase there no
doublers here typically they would be in
this line between these caps and the
MOSFETs no doublers so sick
teen phase via the PWM controller and on
the power stages and here are CSD nine
five four eight zeros they are seventy
amp power stages in total they're
looking at 1120 amps which is quite high
and then the I think builds I'd might
called overkill but we'll throw that to
him for his analysis later you'll find
it on our channel hopefully and then the
memory so they've stepped down they're
using 60 amp per phase on memory and it
is a three-phase and that's these three
up here and then for the other phases
for the core you'll find those in this
line and this line over here one thing
you might be asking about is why the
chokes are sideways so we're not exactly
sure why Asus decided to rotate these
two chokes
all we know is that it's potentially
going to be useful for a future design
but we don't know anything about what
that design will be or why it needs them
rotated maybe an ln2 card or something
like that maybe it's some kind of
ellentube pot clearance we don't know
we're not sure but they rotated these
specifically for a future design so this
PCB will probably be used again you'll
probably see this vrm again we just
don't know what it'll be for yet for the
rest they are using s AP chokes and
they're using a u p9 v 1/2 buck
controller it has four three two and one
phase modes available they've got a u p
765 one for RTD and vin power balancing
and current steering with a block of
four SMDs
indicating that let me find that for you
so that would be this over here this
block of these small for service mount
devices right there that's going to be
part of the VIN Power Balance and
current steering this small cluster here
and then the rest we'll talk about
hopefully in a builds IDE video if we
can get one for the rest of the CRM
layout on the back side of the PCB
there's not a whole lot going on but we
have some capacitors rear of the GPU of
course capacitors on/off switch for the
LEDs LED plug and that just goes into
the ACS I logo so stuff we've all seen
before for the most part and that more
or less sums it up we've gotten pretty
much everything couple
small SMDs over here so that's the HTS
card that takes care of the PCB the GPU
itself which we haven't formally shown a
production sample and the cooler which
is significantly larger they're all
testing more or less done at this point
but we can't share the data yet so well
we'll let you know as soon as we're
allowed to what the thermal performance
looks like we're testing all the cards
and we'll have that data out pretty much
in the immediate future he'll you'll
know soon how well does we've also gone
through most of the testing we needed to
go through four cards leading up to
today so we have enough to start taking
things apart and seeing how they're
built at this point and then finally the
base plate I didn't really talk much
about when we were in the teardown mode
but it's got thermal pads of course for
the memory and then throne pads for some
of the erm components on the other side
and that I think takes care of the base
plate it's really pretty straightforward
a lot of it is structural at this point
we're holding the card together and
reducing sag small fins over here always
curious what that does because it seems
like such a small thing that it is right
above some MOSFETs and it's above where
some MOSFETs contact the base plate and
there's even a small stand off of the
aluminium for those MOSFETs that the
thermal pad is on top of so it would
help a bit in theory it's just how much
in practice does it really help but
that's the ACS card we already have data
on some of it we'll have data for a lot
of other cards coming up soon check back
subscribe if you're not already you can
go to stored on cameras axis dotnet to
pick up one of the mod mats we used in
this video
or patreon.com/scishow and exit selves
out directly and thank you for holding
out while we finish the office move
where we're back up and running now so
we have a lot of technical content
coming up very shortly this was the
first of many and make sure you come
