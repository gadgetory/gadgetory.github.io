carriage we're moving from cases two
video cards this year has been a huge
milestone year for all of the silicon
manufacturers with NVIDIA introducing
Pascal and the introducing Polaris and
Intel moving to broad well II and KB
lake later this year today we're
focusing on the GTX 1080 AIB cards
though before that this coverage is
brought to you by enermax and their new
lick max giant open loop liquid cooler
with RGB LED support Polaris 10 and the
RX 480 didn't reveal in time for AI be
partners to debut cards at computex and
the gtx 1070 aib models were only
presented by EVGA for some reason so for
this roundup we're sticking to the 1080
models but there's plenty to work with
here anyway and there's no particular
order to this list short of a kingpin
model EVGA is most impressive feat of
engineering and the current generation
is its GTX 1080 classified which runs a
14 plus three phase power design and is
fitted with a monstrous heatsink the
card is able to bypass v bios
limitations by connecting to EV bot and
that's an external hardware utility if
you're not aware theoretically this will
allow a higher overclock to be pushed
with the extra over voltage to stabilize
the clock rate the reason for the use of
the word theoretically is because there
may yet be other limitations within the
nvidia v bios or drivers or something
like that but we're still exploring
those issues the classified card is TBD
on its price as is the new version of
the hybrid and we built our own GTX 1080
hybrid previously pretty recently but
EVGA S has got a cleaner more official
look and versioning to it EVGA told us
that they saw very similar cooling
performance to what we tested in our
labs on our own hacked together hybrid
and that plants the hybrid version of
the 1080 at around 18 celsius delta t /
ambient that's a massive performance
improvement that reduces voltage and
power leakage and improves overall clock
stability and just generally being a
cooler GPU where most interested though
in the hybrid and the FTW versions of
the card just because the tremendously
effective cooling solution on the hybrid
EVGA uses an asa tech block that has
extruded copper cold plate something
which benefits the GPU greatly when
compared to something like the Seahawk
which is a card that has the age 55 CPU
clcs from corsair and the hybrid runs a
10+2 phase of vrm and uses the same
board design as the FTW card so it is
effectively an FTW hybrid both of these
have extra power headers as does the
classified and only the EVGA SC lacks
custom designs and is effectively a
reference 1080 but with the AC x3 point
0 cooler for six hundred and fifty
dollars we tried live overclocking MSI's
twin frozr Z card at their computex
sweet but ended up limited by SLI
complexities and just being on a show
floor still the new twin frozr cards
have moved to an updated square heat
pipe design for greater surface area and
points of contact on the heatsink and
they also use a new dispersion blade fan
design so that uses an inter mixed
assortment of dispersion blades and
traditional fan blades to help push and
pull air as necessary through the
aluminum heatsink these are mounted to
the faceplate of course which is atop
the heat sink and the heatsink has five
to six heat pipes within it and these
are the new square design msi has
updated its GPU line as well with the Z
video cards at the high end the X in the
middle and gaming cards at the bottom
and that's their new stack the GTX 1080
Z ships with the highest clock and a 10
plus 1 phase of erm the memory phasing
does seem a bit odd maybe should be 10
plus 2 or something like that but the
gaming series will run a more simplified
vrm we're not sure on the exact
specifications of that just yet we do
know however the MSI's cards will reach
all the way down to the six hundred
dollar MSRP that Nvidia posted during
its initial announcement of the 1080
there is no lightning as of yet you may
have seen the black and yellow beast and
some of our footage up to now or in
previous videos and the one of the show
the one that you've seen is sadly only
at 980 TI lightning there is no 1080
lighting just yet gigabyte is one of the
biggest competitors in the market we
recently toured their smt line and
taiwan to see how video cards and mother
our maid revealing a pretty high volume
operation the g1 gaming is gigabyte
smart entry level video card price at
six hundred fifty dollars and outfitted
with a simpler heatsink then its larger
brother the g1 gaming and extreme gaming
cards are both limited on information
right now with the vrm phasing and over
voltage specs presently undefined at
least by the representatives at the
booth and sweet and the extreme gaming
card uses a stack to fan cooler so this
is something new for gigabyte basically
it's two sets of fan blades stacked
centrally with flanking normal fans on
either side it's a weird setup and we're
not really sure how the turbulence and
noise are or how it will cool but it
should be interesting test once we get
one in our labs the extreme gaming card
should be about 670 to six hundred
eighty dollars and the g1 gaming will be
about 650 we discovered asus strix on
the show floor at computex hidden away
in an XG station to external GPU
enclosure the Strix mostly focuses on
advertising asus is low noise cooler and
hosts some more toned down a plus to vrm
phasing design it's not going as hard on
the overclocking subtext as some of its
competitors which should help with the
price positioning the GTX 1080 Strix is
making the most noise with its or RGB
LEDs and I say noise I mean marketing
not actual noise and that does seem to
be a big thing these days even though I
haven't mentioned it gigabyte also had
RGB LEDs EVGA also had RGB LEDs and ms
high had RGB LEDs so this is really
something that pretty much everyone's
got at this point besides that it's just
more TBD on some of the ACS products in
the near future now speaking very
briefly of again msi they partnered with
corsair and so there's two video cards
with different names but it's it's the
same device it is the exact same card
and that is the Seahawk from msi or the
hydrographics if buying from Corsairs
webstore same device it's a
liquid-cooled GTX 1080 and it's using in
h55 CPU a closed-loop liquid cooler
mounted to the GPU block and reviewed
the original Seahawk in mine a TTI form
if you're curious
how that performed now there were other
cards and vendors at computex but these
are the ones that we have the most
hands-on time with there's GALEX and
zotac and plenty of other folks who had
interesting cars will hopefully be
talking about those more in the near
future but for now this is what we've
got and just one thing closing out here
I'm not quite sure how well the ultra
high-end cards will perform just yet
sort of like the classified and extreme
gaming devices we're unsure of where
they will be landing in the performance
stack because of limitations and v bios
and elsewhere and depending on if these
vendors will bypass those limitations it
remains to be seen if there's sort of
asymptotic frame rate performance or
overclocked performance and this is
something that we're investigating
actively and we'll keep you all updated
on that's all for this recap subscribe
