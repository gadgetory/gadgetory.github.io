forward to this day for many years all
of us have been working towards this day
for many years today I have three
announcements to make
morgan and an ounce of revolutionary
television a game console and a
supercomputer we're going to write stuff
to talk about so let's get started and
today I want to talk about a brand new
place that journey has taken us the
living room initially application after
another will replace the dedicated
devices that we have in the living room
make it here in living room a little bit
more elegant but before you know it
applications will come along that
surprises we don't even know what it is
and I have no idea what it is I do know
this there are a lot of clever people in
the world if they only have access to a
ridge computing device a large screen
and a cloud store amazing things can
happen well this is a very very fast
growing segment I believe that someday
everybody is going to want a smart
television experience everybody will
want a smart television experience this
is likely a multi-billion unit market it
is just the beginning I believe we can
make a unique contribution here so
ladies and gentlemen today we are
entering and introducing Nvidia's first
living room entertainment device the
Nvidia shield
take a consolation while the Nvidia
shield was designed I'm so proud of it
the nvidia design team really outdid
themselves the Nvidia shield is designed
with a couple of ideas in mind first of
all it has to be performant performance
is one of the key attributes of this
little sleek box however it also has to
be modern it has to look elegant and has
to look elegant whether it's sitting
flat or sitting on its edge right now
it's sitting at a stand that's designed
for shield it is a one-piece anodized
cast die cast aluminum that's a machine
exquisitely when you get up close to it
that is just a beautiful thing it feels
cold and heavy in your hands and you
slide shield perfectly into it shin was
designed to look good both playing down
as well sitting up but one of its most
important functionality of course is all
the peripherals that has to all the
things that it has to connect to so
gigabit ethernet of course it has one of
the highest performance Wi-Fi systems
for reasons that I'll tell you about
later USB connectors and such it's
designed so that it looks good in every
single direction this is the bottom and
when it's sitting flat it's incredibly
thin it's incredibly thin
and of course you could enjoy it whether
it's sitting flat or standing on its
edge I think when you pick it up you'll
discover that this is a device that
although looks elegant in fact it's a
different shade on each side ladies and
gentlemen the addition
hold on to your money it won't be much
longer I'll tell you all about in just a
second the Nvidia shield well the design
of course is important but how it works
is even more important and so let's take
a look at what it does so first off if
it is shield it's the world's first 4k
Android TV it's not just for K
resolution it's 4k decode h.265 and it's
full 10 bit video processing the video
on the Nvidia shield is just gorgeous
absolutely gorgeous you don't have a
piece of equipment in your house like
this today and so you could just search
on and on and on and just you know go
from one place to another place well
let's go do something else all right
I'll put some music okay I stopped
listening to music in the 70s but as a
result of I have to ask you to voice
search for your favorite artists on
voice search for my favorite heart as
well Justin Bieber
I was just repeating what the guy the
guy in the front set so what's the song
that he does
jury let's do june let's
let's look at that it's amazing he just
listens to you and comes up with stuff
there you go yeah well who doesn't want
that isn't that the right experience for
your television</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
