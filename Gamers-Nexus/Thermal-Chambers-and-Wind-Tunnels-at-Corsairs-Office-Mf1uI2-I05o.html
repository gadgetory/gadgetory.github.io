validation facilities I'm joined by
Bobby Ken Stahl and Bobby what what do
you do here what do you know about this
stuff so I'm the thermal engineer here
at Corsair I design all the cooling
systems that includes fans liquid
coolers heat sinks I consult air flow
anything that involves heat transfer or
cooling and the first machine or setup I
want to talk about is the thermal
chamber so in this room which you'll see
some of this in a moment but there's a
wind tunnel for fan testing thermal
chamber there's a chromis chromis setup
for power supply testing with this let's
let's just talk about the very basics of
a thermal chamber so we've we've already
said why you would want one in previous
content but what are some of the
different types of chambers available
like humidity temperature control right
okay so basically a thermal chamber is a
heater or refrigerator in a highly
insulated box so you set the temperature
that you want on here and that can be a
high temperature or low temperature for
whatever you're trying to test for and
then it maintains that temperature some
of them are programmable so that they
can go through different temperature
ranges these are basic temperature only
chambers but they also make humidity
control chambers and some chambers with
liquid nitrogen for extreme cooling some
chambers have shock and vibration tables
in them for extreme vibration that sort
of thing some have dry air injection so
they can get to extremely low humidities
or extreme temperature conditions but
for this industry temperature only seems
to do the job just fine so in in what
use case would you want humidity control
for a thermal chamber if you were
building products for a very highly
humid environment like Southeast Asia or
you're concerned about corrosion or
delamination every circuit boards for
example then you would definitely want a
humidity chamber we do that kind of
testing just not at this facility and we
were talking just before shooting this
video about humidity and how it impacts
the heat capacity of there so that's
let's run through that again for viewers
sure the more humidity is in the air the
more heat the air can carry per unit of
volume and that's because the air
density increases so if you have a cubic
foot of air at 20 percent humidity
you're gonna be able to carry a little
bit less heat than a cubic foot of air
at 80% humidity I'm so in that regard
even though high humidity is very
uncomfortable for us people that
actually helps the computer carry heat
better you got it and this chamber here
what what are I guess you test your
coolers cases in here what's the how do
you deploy the chamber yeah we put in
these wires shelfs that are up here on
top we can put a computer in here or
just a power supply or just a cooler I
can show you in the next chamber over we
have a setup for testing processors
who's thinking called a thermal test
vehicle which is an actual processor
made by Intel and it goes into an actual
processor socket and has the same
mounting as a heatsink
you can attach a heatsink to it and then
the wires come out of this thing goes to
a power supply and you turn it up and
it's eater it's just a teeter chip it
doesn't actually compute and then I can
say I want a hundred watts and then I
can measure the temperature at the top
of the die and it's temperature
differential and then calculate how well
the heat sink is working all right so
you can basically simulate a CPU because
you can set the the wattage I guess they
simulate the higher TDP authority to me
chips exactly compiling whatever power
level I want so that's pretty cool okay
so we've moved camera shots this is what
we were just talking about so can you
walk me through this all right this is
an intel thermal test vehicle for
songket 2011 processor it has a socket
2011 sized CPU device here has a heater
built into it the heater is the same
size as the microprocessor in real life
so it has the same heat flux per square
millimeter as a real processor this
little line right here on top is a
thermocouple that's embedded in there
that allows me to measure the
temperature at the very top of the
package I can measure the temperature of
the heat sink or I can measure the
temperature of the ambient and then
calculate the effectiveness of the heat
sink and his performance in degree C per
watt I know how much power I put into it
by running it with my DC power supply
over here so know exactly how much power
is going in you know exactly how much
he's coming out and then I can have very
good idea on the performance of the
thermal system so for this program will
DC power supply what can you tell me so
as the name suggests it's a DC power
supply I can set it to output any
voltage that I want it has current
limits for safety but what makes this
very special isn't
that it's programmable because it has
highly accurate metering built into it
so I can say you know we've got four
digits of precision on voltage and
current so I have a very very good idea
how much power is going into it it cares
so much that it actually measures the
voltage at the ttv not at the terminals
here so it compensates for the voltage
drop through the wire cool okay so now
we are in front of the wind tunnel let's
start with the report that you have on
screen what's what are we looking at
here okay what we're looking at here is
the actual wind tunnel report for the
Corsair ML 120 blue LED fan these lines
here each line represents the pressure
and flow at a particular point so this
axis is pressure this axis is flow the
maximum pressure respect that you see on
the box is always measured at zero flow
wind tunnel closes itself completely
runs the fan at a speed measures the
pressure at this location and then plots
that point here this point is not useful
to system designers other than to just
have some way of comparing the system
because this doesn't occur in real life
if you have zero flow it's not doing
good for you at all the wind tunnel
begins by opening valves inside here and
allowing some air to flow from first
chamber into second chamber and that
reduces the static pressure and the flow
increases so as that happens the next
data point is here and then it opens up
some more in here and here and here and
it works its way all the way down until
the pressure here equals atmospheric
pressure and that is the zero resistance
point or maximum flow which is the other
spectate see on the box this also
doesn't occur in reality because if you
don't have any resistance there's
nothing in the way of your fan in
reality your system will be somewhere in
between these points and you can plot a
resistance curve for say like a radiator
and that curve will go up in this
direction and where those two curves
intersect is the actual pressure and
flow that you will receive when you
combine those elements in a system
that's actually the really useful
information so each one of these lines
is a different speed there's a hundred
percent 90 percent eighty percent and so
on all the way down to 20 percent the
horizontal lines here
are the fans rpm achievement this is the
fans rpm and so this blue line
corresponds with this orange kind of
peach colored line pants green line with
this purple line etc and shows the RPMs
over here as you can see this fan is
very stable regardless the amount of
resistance it receives it doesn't really
fluctuate in speed very much and that so
that's the rapport you get after using
it mechanically let's like ass walk from
this end to that and what's going on
inside of the wind tunnel so let's back
up just a smidge here's the plate where
we mount the device to be tested a fan
or radiator I've even hooked up whole
cases to this thing and measured flow
resistance in cases this ring right here
is attached to four pressure taps this
is the static pressure sensor measures
this in relationship to atmospheric
pressure outside of the room inside here
there are several screens those are to
diffuse the flow so that the air flows
at the same speed through the entire
diameter the wind tunnel that's
necessary for the calculations because
the math makes certain assumptions about
the dimer of the wind tunnel and how
fast the air is flowing these two
pressure taps here are differential
they're measured against each other and
this is the high site pressure this is
the low side pressure in this pleat here
in the middle there's a series of valves
that start out about half an inch in
diameter and go all the way up to
several inches in diameter and it can
open one or more valves depending on the
type of test that it's doing this chart
here actually shows the smallest valves
eight millimeters in diameter
and the largest is 42 but in this 32
plus 42 and all and it tells you to CFM
range for whatever combination of Alps
you have open at that time so when
measuring the differential pressure
across here and knowing the exact
diameter of the valve it knows the
barometric pressure and it knows the
temperature in community the air
calculates the air density can then
calculate the exact CFM flowing through
the system this chamber has a couple
more screens in it to equalize the flow
and then that tube goes out to a big fan
right there that's the counter blower
this is necessary because the wind
tunnel itself has significant air flow
resistance and so it actually pulls a
vacuum in this chamber in order to get
the flow that it needs to achieve in the
first chamber this chamber often
operates below atmospheric pressure
that's normal so in order to get to eat
this chamber at this point here to equal
atmospheric pressure this chamber here
has to be significantly below
atmospheric pressure
very cool then wrapping it all back to
the end product this is the the numbers
that come up on the box at the end of
the day come up in the new I expects
sheet comes from something like this I
guess that's correct
all the published specifications for all
of our fan products come out of this
machine this machine costs about
seventy-five thousand dollars and once
year I fly a guy out from Taiwan to come
calibrate it
his calibration reports are NIST
traceable and you can actually go up in
the National Institute of Standards
website and look it up so I am very
confident in the numbers and performance
data that comes out of this machine so
for more information as always link in
the description below we'll have an
article with more information Thank You

see you all next time
