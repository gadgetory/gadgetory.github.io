Nexus dotnet and I just wanted to show
off some really stupid cables that are
you should not buy anything in this
video so first of all this is an HDMI to
VGA cable this is a digital signal and
this is an analog signal this doesn't
work if this tries to send a signal over
to the side it's not going to go
anywhere it's not going to do anything
if you plug this into your computer
which I did it will not do anything so
in order for this to work you need some
kind of converter box in between the
convert the signal this does not have
that you can buy this on Amazon you can
probably buy this on Newegg and it's a
couple bucks and it's basically a a
really inefficient paperweight so that
is our HDMI to VGA cable do not buy
these and of course now you're all going
to bikes I said that so tell them I sent
you I guess and we've also got let's
let's scary to that we've also got a DVI
dueling cable here so I wanted to
mention this again we mentioned it
before I can't stress it enough there
are a lot of fake dueling cables sold
this is a particularly fat dueling cable
because it is actually dual link if we
look at this cable over here this is
actually what a lot of the fake dual
link cables will look like because they
they have the pins but they don't
actually have the pins wired to anything
they're just pins with no connection so
they might as well not exist so a proper
dual link cable should cost a little bit
more and and it's going to actually have
reviews that say hey this supports 2560
by 1600
whereas a fake one isn't going to
support that because it's not real so if
it looks too good to be true it probably
is
and while we're on the note of cables I
wanna mention sing a tubers SATA 3 there
are a lot of fallacies out there a lot
of people on the internet on message
boards on whatever website they're like
you're not going to get full speeds if
you buy say the two cable with your SSD
that's not true they work at the same
speed SATA 2 versus SATA 3 cables are
identical in terms of their throughput
other than the little clip at the top so
if you really like that little Clippy
thing and you like the noise it makes
them buy us a 2 3 cable but otherwise
don't worry about it it's the same speed
so that's all if I have for you this
time be sure to check out links in the
description below for other cable videos
I just put a big one up and we will see
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
