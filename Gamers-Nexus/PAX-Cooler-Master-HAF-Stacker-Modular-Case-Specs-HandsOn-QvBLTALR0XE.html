Donette and we are here at PAX Prime at
2013 and I am here with Nate Ullman
official product champion of
coolermaster and today we are showing
off the half stacker Nate what can you
tell us about the half stacker it could
tell us a little bit about the design
what you're trying to do with it okay
yeah so we came out with the half series
of several years ago and we've been
trying to improve it and we have like
most people are familiar with the half
product line as a whole so we're just
trying to get more ridiculous and make
it more open for everybody so the the
case we have behind us this is a 945
each of these segments has its own
individual name these are nine 15s this
is a 925 and another 915 so 25 into tens
gives you 45 so what you have here is
the top portion has a dual 360 radiators
billed through six Raiders on the bottom
they have all the internal components
and it has a sliding mechanism so we're
going for like a total modularity
enthusiasts just max out go crazy
everything in here was put in under
stock circumstances we didn't have the
ladders do any kind of drilling or any
kind of cutting or removing any parts so
nothing's been removed everything's here
right now in this rig there are 17 fans
so you have the 17 jet flows I think he
calculated up earlier that's like
seventeen hundred CFM it's ridiculous
it's overkill for most people but
there's still room for three fans on
each other side of the radiator that you
can't see three more fans on the top
fans for the front that we aren't even
putting on so if you just want to load
this thing up air cooling wise you could
totally do it can you tell us a little
bit more about the the design process
how you came up with a case idea it's
pretty crazy I haven't seen anything
like it before
what how did you come up with it okay so
at at CES 2013 we had tried to make a
revision of the 932 and we were calling
it the 935 but it just wasn't a big
enough change there wasn't enough there
wasn't a compelling reason for somebody
with a 932 to buy a 935 because
aesthetically like the 932 is already
really cool-looking and it has so much
of a performance
jump over other cases that there just
wasn't a reason for you to buy it so
what we did was we were just kind of in
the backroom and one of our product
managers John said what if we just
started sacking them up like what if you
could just put cases on top of cases on
top of cases and get ridiculous so if
you want something I think he was being
like sarcastic about it but it kind of
hit hit it you know it hit rung true so
you're like you know what let's do that
that is a good idea
so the they've started you in a mock-up
so in I mean we're seven months away
from yeah we're seven months away from
right now and here we have a case in
front of us built off of an idea that
somebody come up with at CES so then we
just kind of built it up from there we
came out our different modules like like
these two on top and bottom we have a
bunch of other add-ons with like side
panel windows a full side panel window
if you want to have a side panel window
oh I forgot a fan there's a 200-meter
fan on the side so if you want a full
window you can buy that from us if you
want a window in a fan we have that if
you want windows on both sides of this
we can do that it's just unlimited and
open and as modular and as user-friendly
as we can make it if you just want small
cases we have small case if you want big
we have big just and as I understand it
you're incorporating some feedback from
modders from the community that can you
tell us who you're working with what
they have what they've said so far yeah
we're working with Lee Harrington and
wrongly Christensen who do as you can
see amazing work they put they put all
these systems together in 48 hours and
then drove them over here just just
phenomenal phenomenal like he just you
know so what happened is they gave us
feedback they asked if they could have
this bottom drive they removed we said
sure can we remove this yeah we'll make
that possible but don't do it yet you
know don't do it yet so we told them do
whatever you can with what what's
available so we had you know all the
radiators and stuff shipped out and they
just fit in fit in everything they could
and it looked it looks really good like
we're all really happy about how
everything turned out continuing on with
the rest of the stacker case we have two
modules right here that Nate wants to
show off to us so Nate what can you tell
us about these two modules okay so all
the stack case all the 1/2 stacker cases
have this modularity built in where you
can as the name suggest stack them up so
what I'm going to show you right here is
here's two 915 stacked on top of each
other you can slide it back and lift it
off and you can put another one on top
of this one if you wanted to this top
portion comes off as you see so each set
comes with a top panel and feet so
wherever you want your feet to be if you
want to have three these stacked up you
could have three of them stacked up if
you want to stack up on top of the 925 I
guess gonna set up let's take it out the
925 as in this case you can do that
put them under as is this is the case
whatever you want to do we're leaving to
open we're leaving as open as we can for
you guys so yeah so if you look at the
top here it's completely open so if you
had another one on top of it you can
pass through on the cable on the cable
portion as you're gonna see on your next
video
all right so in the link in the
description below you'll see our next
video of the stacker case including a
full rundown of all the specs it's
pretty crazy to 690 s it's got some
Maximus 6 board no big deal so check out
the coolermaster half stacker we'll have
all the links below full article and I
will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
