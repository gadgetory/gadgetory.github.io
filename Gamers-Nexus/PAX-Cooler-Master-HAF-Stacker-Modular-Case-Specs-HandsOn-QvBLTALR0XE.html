Donette and we are here at PAX Prime at
2013 and i'm here with neoman official
product champion of cooler master and
today we are showing off the half
stacker Nate what can you tell us about
the half stacker can tell us a little
bit about the design what you're trying
to do with it ok yeah so we came out
with the half series of several years
ago and we've been trying to improve it
and we have like most people are
familiar with the half product line as a
whole so we're just trying to get more
ridiculous and make it more open for
everybody so the case we have behind us
this is a 945 each of these segments has
its own individual name these are nine
fifteens this is a 925 and another 9 15
so 25 to tens gives you 45 so what you
have here is the top portion has a dual
360 radiators build 36 Raiders on the
bottom they have all the internal
components and it has a sliding
mechanism so we're going for like a
total modularity enthusiast just max out
go crazy everything in here was put in
under stock circumstances we didn't have
the Lauder's do any kind of drilling or
any kind of cutting or removing any
parts so nothing's been removed
everything's here right now in this rig
there are 17 fans so you have the 17 jet
flows I think he calculated up earlier
it's like 1700 CFM it's ridiculous it's
overkill for most people but there's
still room for three fans on each other
side of the radio that you can't see 3
more fans on the top fans for the front
that we aren't even putting on so if you
just want to load this thing up air
cooling wise you could totally do it can
you tell us a little bit more about the
the design process how you came up with
a case idea is pretty crazy I haven't
seen anything like it before what how
did you come up with it ok so at at CES
2013 we had tried to make a revision of
the 932 and we're calling it the 935 but
it just wasn't a big enough change there
wasn't enough there was no compelling
reason for somebody with a 932 to buy a
935 because aesthetically like the 932
is already really cool-looking and it
has so much of a performance
jump over other cases that there just
wasn't a reason for you to buy it so
what we did was we were just kind of in
the back room and one of our product
managers John said what if we just
started stacking them up like what if
you could just put cases on top of cases
on top of cases and get ridiculous so if
you want something I think he was being
like sarcastic about it but it kind of
hit hit it you know it hit wrong true so
we're like you know what let's do that
that is a good idea so the they've
started you in a mock-up so in I mean
we're seven months away from yeah we're
seven months away from right now and
here we have a case in front of us built
off of an idea that somebody come up
with at CES so then we just kind of
built it up from there we came out our
different modules like like these two on
top and bottom we have a bunch of other
add-ons with like side panel windows a
full side panel window if you want to
have a side panel window oh I forgot a
fan there's a 200 millimeter fan on the
side so if you want a full window you
can buy that from us if you want a
window in a fan we have that if you want
windows on both sides of this we can do
that it's just unlimited and open and as
modular and as user friendly as we can
make it if you just want small cases we
have small case if you want big we have
big just and as I understand it you're
incorporating some feedback from modders
from the community back can you tell us
who you're working with what they have
what I've said so far yeah we're working
with lee harrington and wrongly
Christiansen who do as you can see
amazing work they put they put all these
systems together in 48 hours and then
drove them over here just just
phenomenal phenomenal like he just so
what happened is they gave us feedback
they asked if they could have this
bottom drive bay removed we said sure
can we remove this yeah we'll make that
possible but don't do it yet you know
don't do it yet so we told them do
whatever you can with what what's
available so we had you know all the
radiators and stuff shipped out and they
just fit it fit in everything they could
and it looks it looks really good like
we're all really happy about how
everything turned out continuing on with
the rest of the stacker case we have two
modules right here that Nate wants to
show off to us so Nate what can you tell
us about these two modules ok so all the
stack case all the half stacker cases
have this modularity built in where you
can as the name suggests stack them up
so what I'm going to show you right here
is here's 2 9-15 stacked on top of each
other you can slide it back and lift it
off and you can put another one on top
of this
if you want to do this top portion comes
off as you see so each set comes with a
top panel and feet so wherever you want
your feet to be if you want to have
three these stacked up you could have
three of them stacked up if you want to
stack up on top of the 925 I guess gonna
set up let's take on how the 925 as in
this case you can do that put them under
as is this is the case whatever you want
to do we're leaving to open we're
leaving as open as we can for you guys
so yeah so if you look at the top here
it's completely open so if you had
another one on top of it you can pass
through on the cable on the cable
portions you're going to see on your
next video alright so in the link in the
description below you will see our next
video of the stacker case including a
full rundown of all the specs it's
pretty crazy 26 90 s it's got some
maximus 6 board no big deal so check out
the cooler master half stacker will have
all the links below full article below
and I will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
