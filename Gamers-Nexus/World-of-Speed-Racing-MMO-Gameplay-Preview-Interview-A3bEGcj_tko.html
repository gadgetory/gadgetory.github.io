nexus da net and we are at GDC 2014 this
is day one for us you can check out some
of the coverage below in the links if
you want to see what we did yesterday
with the everquest guys i am here today
looking at world of speed by slightly
mad studios i'm joined by sean
fitzpatrick from slightly mad give us a
quick top-level rundown of what world of
speed is world of speed is a triple-a
MMO racing experience and we're taking
the Jonah of racing putting it online
letting you race against other people
and other groups of friends colleagues
and that adding the MMO twist on to our
racing genre though so it's not all just
about focusing on getting first in a
race it's also about complaint leading
kind of quests that are in the race and
objectives all these contribute which
are driving style to how you win the
race and therefore or it's your team's
winning the race well then just
individuals what are some of the
attributes that build into driver XP
kind of cornering and stuff like that
yeah there is a most years things
actually building to your driver score
and your driving style so the XP point
you're doing for driving actions like
drifting drafting sliding at cleaning
overtakes things like that I said we
have objectives / races so there might
be a team objective of lead the race for
X number of seconds and this objective
is contributed by all members of the
team so I might lead for a few seconds
you might and it comes down to if we had
threshold that our team gets points for
getting that objective so that as well
as obviously you're finishing position
they all build in together and as it
comes to team racing and a lot of MMOs
we have things like guild houses and
clan systems are you doing anything like
that here yeah world of speed will have
its racing club's which in essence feed
friends can come together join a club
they can enter races together there'll
be lots of game modes specific for
clones and do things like territory wars
where you can take ownership of tracks
and this will gain access to the kind of
castles on that track which will give
special perks to the clubs that are on
the shuttle
are there any license tracks you can
tell us about right now yeah we have a
kind of a mixture of licensed trucks
being cities and actual real-world
racing tracks at some of the cities that
are we have our the new in San Francisco
that we've just demo here today and
we've London in Moscow we also on the
real world track to be brands hatch and
we have many others but they're on the
rhapsode moment and how about cars
parents yet again we are adding
different carriers and manufacturers and
a daily basis and ones that we have an
out so far we like dodge BMW mercedes we
have McLaren in there which is awesome
and but yet there's lots of cars we have
that we just can't actually announced
just yet but as this is an online game
even after we go live we will be adding
more tracks and Karis constantly so with
racing games were concerned about the
feel of the game and concerned about
viewpoints vantage points like cockpit
mode looking at you good too what can
you tell us about how you've calculated
the feel of the cars as you're driving
what what makes me as a player feel like
it's intuitive to a real car well we've
spent a lot of time at at slightly
materials we've her pedigree is in
racing games so we know how to make a
racing game we're making for past ten
years so we know how guys feel we know
how they drive we know what people want
in them we're terror in this game as
specifically as kind of them we're
allowing everyone coming to this it's
gonna be tailored for keyboards joy pads
wheels every type of input and they were
all going to feel as equally fun that we
don't want you have to have the wheel to
it add to kind of field to get the
competitive advantage you're a keyboard
is gonna be our main one that we're
focusing on that it has to be good has
to be flown on keyboard which is the
main one that we're going for we have a
variety of different viewpoints you're
saying from kind of third person camera
cockpit mellowed varnish know that there
are a lot that the players can cycle to
set it up the way they like to play but
we want to successful to as many people
as possible very cool and where can
everyone go to learn more about upcoming
updates and stuff like that well if you
go to our website world of speed calm
