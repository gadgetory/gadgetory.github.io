the ps1 classic it probably still works
just that it's it's pretty simple parts
ultimately we have a video on that
separately if you want to see it but
what we haven't yet looked at is the
controllers and this is arguably one of
the most important aspects of the ps1
classic first of all because it's weight
is equal to the entire device that plays
the games and secondly replicating the
mechanical feel of playing the games on
the original controller this one is
important getting the experience right
so we have these we're gonna disassemble
one of these from the new ps1 classic
it's a $100 console whether or not it's
worth it we haven't yet reached a
verdict but we'll link it below anyway
in case you think it is and then we're
gonna take apart one of these and see
how the components differ between the 24
year old controller and the new one and
also I'm going to need this because we
bought the 24 year old controller used
before that this video is brought to you
by EVGA SRT X 20 atti XE ultra video
card we recently use this to beat our
founders edition overclocking results
with its additional power target
Headroom and cooling capabilities the XE
Ultra uses a 2.7 extra thick heatsink
for a quiet operation under low loads
but also maintains higher clocks on
average over the FE model learn more at
the link in the description below here's
the process we're gonna take for
disassembling these to make the best
comparison we are going to follow the
same steps for each one and just mirror
them so it'll be take off the back of
this one take off the back of this one
and keep progressing through it and if
there are any differences even in the
screws we'll find them just because it'd
be kind of interesting to see what has
changed over all tools for the job we're
just gonna use a pair of Phillips head I
fix it
screwdrivers I'll link the protec
toolkit down below and then we're
working on our GN mod mat which you can
find on store doc gamers nexus net which
will be useful for screw tracking on the
grid even though it's got a GPU
silhouette let's start with the old
controller this is a legitimate ps1
controller with a copyright date that is
not externally visible but it is from
the SCP H 1080 that's the controller and
it came with the original 1000 series
ps1
and is probably kind of gross this was
probably not used since like 20 years
ago
which means anything on it is dead by
now but we did buy it on eBay so a
probably good idea just do some basic
cleaning first other Philips this been
opened before actually these are
slightly stripped some of these so
previous owner may have cleaned this out
hopefully that's just glue or 20 years
of human skin we have a PCB that we'll
have to look at but let's first take
apart the new one and see so far these
steps are the same although these screws
are much cleaner and not tampered with
controller Sony Computer Sony interact
they've changed the name of the company
used to say Sony Computer Entertainment
but legal legal changes they cannot get
away with skirting I don't think sort of
the most immediate differences here you
can see that the base of the original
controller has these plastic supports
underneath the button panel and the
d-pad we're just pushing down on those
things give some rigidity beneath them
that would be my understanding of what
those are there for and then because
there's no electromechanical function
other than just support and then this
one instead of having these supports on
the base of the controller they've moved
them to the top of the controller and
attach them to the underside of the PCB
mount which is actually quite different
as well because if you look at this old
pcp size difference is tremendous first
of all they've also got like pieces of
PCB in here for the button the bumpers
we'll show you that in a second
but man this is just tremendously
different it's amazing how much we've
shrunk in technology but so whole PCB
here versus just a small one that's
attached to a piece of ply
like what the supports now moved to the
plastics probably a bit bit more sturdy
that way but for the cabling that's been
changed to one that you could actually
disconnect from here if we cut the if we
sort of unwrap that cable that'll come
out
that's just a USB header so there you go
micro USB for this cable which is pretty
cool because it's USB to USB so if you
wanted to plug this into your system you
could like your PC so that plugs in
which is obviously a major technological
difference whereas this one has just a a
pin out that feeds into a much fatter
cable and that is six wire cable you can
see a capacitor underneath it which we
don't really see these types of
capacitors and this kind of electronic
too much anymore where it's a really
small device now we have much more power
efficient solutions they don't require
the same type of capacitance we also
have smaller capacitors so look at that
in a second but mechanically the
differences are already so much
significant and a lot of that is getting
rid of this massive unnecessary PCB what
about measurements so standard centered
about eighty one point seven plus or
minus one Center to seven er that's
pretty damn good base of ELINT and r2
right 110 point four four pretty damn
good or nine point eight six I would say
that's within error so that's about 880
one point four it's about eighty one
point four okay so let's just let's go
ahead and call it say controller is more
or less exact replica in terms of the
distance of everything in size and so
that's pretty cool that's true to treat
a spirit and other differences here so
the base you can see that there are
these two supports around the screw down
there which don't exist on the new one
and then you can also see that the
trigger button or whatever their
official terminology is is installed a
bit differently where they've got this
sort of bracket down here that's screwed
in and act as a support and they can't
they can't press right now because no
it's not attached to anything whereas
this one does not have the external
support it's just a button it's
completely independent independently
mechanical hold itself and all that
stuff on the top half buttons here are
executed a little differently you've got
this entire external housing around the
switch itself that's the switch it's a
rubber switch we don't know what it is
yet probably Omron or something like
that is this that is a rubber switch as
well pretty similar similar feel overall
but housed it differently and then for
this PCB that controller has indeed not
this but like I see I ok BC 8 3 0 AZ 0 B
revision a 0 1 so do with that what you
will I'd have to look it up and maybe
maybe well in a bit
that's a controller of some kind as an
integrated sorry like you know literal
controller not a handout game controller
ribbon cable here attached into probably
another small PCB will look up that USB
cable you could easily replace it if you
need it to that's really nice meanwhile
on this one it's just a bunch of PCB so
you have these cables running around the
whole outer edge of it those connect
with the PCB here that it looks like is
acting as an interconnect to the trigger
buttons and then it's going down it's
got the wire here to interface with the
base PCB I'd be curious what the latency
difference is between button presses on
new and all this by unnoticeable but it
is I'd be curious to see if it's
measurable let's get this PCB out of
here this should just lift up this whole
thing might lift out to you but let's
maybe extract the PCB first I think ok
got it
those cables are exceptionally easy to
break so if you ever open one of these
be careful of that so this has a little
clip on it
there's a clip over here and a clip here
so these two clips right there
you just push those back and then it'll
pop off the rails that it's on so we
push those and this should kind of come
up on its own there it goes okay so you
have to rotate it to get it out it has a
little notch in there so here's our PC
bead there's what's under it if you're
curious just black plastic and we'll
check the other side in a second
PCB let's be careful that liquid metal
on there so the PCB we're doing through
that side that side a this is side B and
there's nothing there for you to look at
but that's what it looks like we'll get
a shot of those names if anyone wants to
look them up online try and find these
parts or something for replacements
later you'll have a reference material
shot for that it's a very simple PCB
it's just acting as as the literal
controller of the processor of the input
how do we disconnect this okay so this
is pretty easy actually this is this is
good construction I will give them that
it's very serviceable so clip here you
just kind of push that plastic clip
there's a pop when it reseats itself so
clip and then there's a clip down in the
bottom left controller near the left
hand grip over here right there and then
the other one was up there that's all it
is just those two that's really cool
that it's so serviceable there you go
that's not something you're gonna see on
the old one I will guarantee you that so
breaking that ribbon cable if you did in
fact break it would be very bad you know
any controller basically or a new entire
strip here so for this you've got a
ribbon cable that runs to everything you
can see these little trace wires inside
of the cable and the plastic housing
those are running to all the buttons and
where's the button itself is it even
yeah so I think what's happening here
you've got your literal buttons on the
top like the the ones you activate and
then those press against the switch
which the the switch is going to be in
here
I don't have switches I guess the the
accurate term if there is no electrical
function I'll show you that in a second
that's pretty cool there's no electrical
function in this switch is entirely
mechanical so you push that down it's
got a spring it activates it depresses
the black bump there and then that
impacts against the electrical switch
over here which is this plate it's not
really a plate but it's just thin sheet
of plastic and then you've got the wires
running through that to detect the
signal so that is the modern version
before we tear this down further let's
look at the old one this is this is a
pretty good design very compact very
cheap and if it holds up it's good I
mean that's you kind of question how
long that holds up but I'm also not
familiar with the other controllers Sony
makes so I don't know if that's their
standard so this one we're gonna unseat
the cable you can see that it's really
crimped in there that disconnect that
might not disconnect I could
individually remove the pins from this
header the header itself I do not
believe unsought has attached to the PCB
so we're gonna leave that there
you've got an old cap which is rated 485
degrees Celsius so you probably I don't
know how many hours to get at 85 C but
every 10 hours beyond that you lose half
the life of the capacitor but these
shouldn't get too hot anyway okay so
that was simple enough okay so these
pull up this is actually pretty clever
engineering as well for the resources
they had of the time to remove that
let's put this aside for a second will
compare there's at the same time as
Matt's getting grossed from the used
part stuff so here's the major
difference is the the top side of the
PCB you can see that's been completely
replaced with just a plastic underlying
sheet and then this electrical is just K
with some buttons integrated in it that
the router pushes impacts and on the old
one it's a PCB you've got a couple small
caps in there a couple resistors for the
cable you can see the pins this is why
we couldn't remove that cable the pins
are sticking through the PCB and
soldered so that does not come out which
is good that I stops trying and there's
a small SMD in the middle this is all
old news by now but nine seven five one
H CFS eight one two one I don't know
anything about that part it's too old
for me to have ever heard of and grow
solder work on this side but that's
where you're getting the attachment for
the bumper button which is attached to
its own PCB you can see those pins
sticking through on this side so that
cable is routed through the PCB and then
all soldered in there that's a thick PCB
- not not that many layers just thick
like plastic style and here's the
correct orientation of it right side up
so there's square X circle triangle and
then you're left down right up so forth
so this is the plate that you're
impacting with the rubber switches on
the the old controller and we'll look at
that - and see how that one how the
build quality is the assembly is on that
one even though I kind of don't want to
touch this part of the controller so
this is the old let's just pull this one
off and don't maybe don't zoom in too
much and give everyone something to have
nightmares about that's not that bad
though and here's the new one so which
one did we just pull out there just put
them on the same orientation so that's
pretty remarkably similar considering
there's 24 years of age between them so
I mean aside from being clear the button
itself
that's pretty damn similar all of this
one's kind of worn out but that's
because it's used internally the okay
internally this thing the d-pad the
d-pad is braced by this crossbar on the
original controller is not braced on the
old one I used on the new one sorry I
you just push this out right now and
other than that and it's a d-pad they
don't appear to have changed very much
than some basic construction like the
plastic mold and these buttons if you
look at them they're same as well they
come out completely there's there's
start select there's this start and
select same kind of button a little bit
different the way it's supported and and
held in those pins on the side the pin
holes and the last one is right there
versus right there so I mean if you
watch the same construction for the most
part it's really remarkable how how
identical they are and I do wonder if
they're rehashing on any of the original
molds or for what their process is for
retaining accuracy this is Chris you can
see that in the reassembly here actually
this is interesting they don't have this
on the old one so and take too careful
attention of how these went and
originally but you can see on this one
there are two different sets of mounts
so you've got a horizontal slot on those
two opposing and then a circular hole on
these two opposing and if you look at
the plastic controller those will
correspond so that actually will make it
easier to just kind of remount it in a
suitable fashion if this new one is
better at keeping grime out of it it's a
it's a bit more sealed than noticing
like all these parts just fit tighter
and they go over the edges of the
plastic which could impact the amount of
gross sness that gets in there but if it
also just because it's brand-new I'm
just starting select you can see that
there are two rubber switches you can
push for that one so there's depress
into the into the buttons over here
that's good enough pretty remarkable
differences overall first of all I want
to touch anything that I wash my hands
that old controllers kind of grips
secondly the PCB has gone to this that's
that's your PCB on the new on it's not
even that complicated in terms of
components I mean there's a couple caps
on there a USB input USB controller and
a ribbon cable from this PCB on the old
one much of which is completely unused I
mean that's the only users on the back
side too but they've compressed it on
the new one to be just the small PCB I
held up and then instead of having a
physical like a hardened PCB a real PCB
printed circuit board on the top side
for the buttons they've replaced it with
just ribbon cable that runs to all the
switches so pretty damn cool interesting
teardown overall I would say a bit bit
more interesting than the ps1 classic
itself but you should check that one out
too because we go through the components
on here what they're capable of and it
is massively improved over the ps1 but
it's also running emulation software so
it has overhead on there that didn't
exist before so that's it for this one
as always subscribe for more if you find
these components interesting we'll link
it below but just we we might not think
it's actually worth it yet I'm not sure
so if you want to buy it you can click
the link but we're not telling YouTube's
we don't know yet otherwise store like
heroes X's not net to pick up a shirt
like this one or a mod matte like the
one I was working on during the video
and you get a page on our coms
schemers exit stops out there as well
