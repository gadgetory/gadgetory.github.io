Donna and I am currently doing a video
to demonstrate the audio microphone
output quality of two different headsets
these are the Plantronics game comm 788
and the HyperX cloud 2 headset I have
some complaints and my cloud to review
that talk specifically about microphone
quality and that's something I like in
the Plantronics headset I'm currently
using a 200 plus dollar special
rapporteur mic that is plugged into a
several hundred dollar audio processor
so this should be about the highest
quality audio that you can get through
YouTube before YouTube starts
compressing things and this is what
you'll want to not compare against the
headsets you're about to hear because
those are $80 headsets that are meant
for gaming so different purposes I'll
let you listen to the audio hey everyone
this is Steve from gamers Nexus dotnet
and I am presently demonstrating the
audio quality of the Plantronics game
comm 788 headset hey everyone this is
Steve from gamers Nexus Donna and I am
presently demonstrating the audio
quality of the Kingston HyperX cloud 2
gaming headset as you heard in each of
those recordings the game comm is a
little bit clearer and doesn't make me
sound as nasally as the HyperX cloud 2
headset does I recorded these within a
few seconds of each other I promise you
that I did not have a severe allergy
issue in that time the cloud 2 simply
makes you sound a bit more nasally it's
a bit muddied at times in gameplay and
it requires the microphone to be
positioned almost invasively close to
the users mouth it is almost touching my
mouth and I'm using it if it's not that
close then it doesn't even pick up my
voice to a level that my teammates can
hear me in csgo
so that that sort of demonstrates my
complaint with the cloud - I really like
the cloud 2 for its audio output quality
but its input is not ideal so that sort
of shows you where as a streamer you
need to draw a line for quality versus
as a casual gamer or as maybe even a
semi competitive gamer you just aren't
gonna care about this as much as a
streamer might and you can overlook the
microphone quality in favor of the
better positional audio that's all for
this video watch the review for more
information and I will see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
