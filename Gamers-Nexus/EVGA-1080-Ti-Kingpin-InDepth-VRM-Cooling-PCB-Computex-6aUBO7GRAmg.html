EVGA s headquarters in Taipei Taiwan and
I'm looking at the new kingpin card so
this is brand-new is a 1080 TI kingpin
it has been teased on Twitter lately but
we have the actual thing here and
they're letting us tear it down as long
as I can get it back together properly
we have all the information already on
the power components here I will be able
to talk through some of that that will
have a separate video on the PCB and BRM
analysis before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by Corsairs
new at t1 race chair which is a $350
gaming targetted chair using a bucket
style race seat the chair arms have four
directional movement for configuration
to your liking and has a bonus they use
rollerblade wheels
learn more at the link in the
description below now we're going to
walk through it so before taking the
spin apart I want to point out a couple
key features that we'll have more
details on in the article linked in the
description below if you're interested
in following all of it very closely you
can check the article so let's start out
with the heatsink solution first of all
this is it's a copper plated so it's not
actually a copper heatsink its copper
plated and in terms of cooling ability
that shouldn't really matter it's like 1
degree Celsius difference between
plating and not plating paint when it
matters not the plating but that's the
heatsink the fin setup is kind of
similar to FTW 3 &amp;amp; SC 2 so we've talked
about the pin fins they call them before
which is something that was introduced
with IC X we've got the pin fins which
are just cylindrical heatsink fins for
more surface area basically it's a
couple of those in there the part that's
actually interesting here aside from the
usual icx stuff that you see is the heat
pipes so the heat pipes on this solution
they're running two sets of pipes so
there's three eight millimeter pipes and
three six millimeter PI's and all six of
those pipes converge centrally on the
GPU as you would expect however in order
to fit all of those pipes and to
actually spread across the cold plate
for the GPU they've got them stacked
vertically which is kind of hard to see
but we'll see it once it's torn down so
pipes are stacked vertically that is a
patented
set up I'm informed by the heatpipe
supplier and that's supposed to allow
for obviously fitting morgy pipes
together in a smaller area without
having to come out of here protrude out
of the cooling area because once you
exit this area of the fans you can no
longer really dissipate the heat from
those heat pipes efficiently that's part
of the problem at the armored head when
we looked at it other than that three
fans set up here it's connected through
MCU they also are using they've replaced
one of the MCS with another component
which we'll talk about later or in the
article at least some meshing for the
shroud but nothing too special there
everything else is is just going to be
unveiled as we tear it down so let's go
ahead and do that now and look at the
power design once we've got the bare PCB
okay so I only have one screwdriver for
this we have a couple screws in the back
plate itself let's go ahead and take
those off first and then move on to the
GPU screws the four main screws which
this driver is a bit small for that but
we'll make do with what we have this
back plate is a monolithic back plate
which really just means that it's one by
cast piece on the IC X cards they've
done two pieces and that's for a for
thermal isolation to some extent but
also just die casting manufacturing
process and cost reasons logistics
things like that this one's one piece
though that's for structural support
because the front side the base plate
where you actually get your real
structural support on these cards is
split into two and we'll look at that in
a bit
splitting the front side into two allows
extreme overclockers like kingpin
himself to remove the GPU side of the
base plate and mount their liquid
nitrogen pot to the GPU which then means
that you're eliminating the one barrier
to that process which is basically
cutting in the way while still being
able to keep a base plate on the power
components things that actually need it
and might not be called by Alan to in
this instance this is something of an
early model keep in mind it's got some
wear and tear on it just from the lab
and testing
a lot of thermal pads as usual these are
a bit worn because again it is a I
believe it's a pre-production model or a
very early one anyway we've split one
and a half here but that's okay it's not
like it's going to retail so we've got
on the backside of the power phase we
have a vrm or a throne pad setup don't
pad backside the GPU it's kind of
interesting color and I'm not sure if
there's any functionality for that
you'll notice that there's a gold-plated
PCB here that's to expose the inner
ground layer to the edge of the PCB as
for how useful that is well to talk to
build Zoid but the point here other than
looks is theoretically actually
functional if the gold plating allows
them to expose this inner ground layer
vram cooling as usual and then the the
name plate with some captain thermal
tape that I'm going to leave alone
because it might be just some kind of
development debugging thing that you're
doing
now actually in couple places the
captain thermal tape that's the same
stuff we use is actually really good for
being both electrically non-conductive
and not a huge thermal insulator or
conductor either
okay we're getting to the point where I
would have to start disconnecting fans
and power and there are a lot of those
so we've got fan here two fans here and
power over here there should be a should
be a sixth one somewhere
okay so we've freed the heatsink let's
remove that and now we have the CCB
which actually looks really cool as that
gold plating on the PCB and the cooler
itself let's start with the cooler and
then we'll talk some the PCB get in full
detail to be in the article including
all the voltage controllers and things
like that I've got all the numbers just
haven't memorized them yet so here we've
got the copper cold plate as you'd
expect protrusions for the vram cooling
and thrown pads on everything now we ask
them EVGA has thermal pads on things
even like the emcee use the reason they
do that is because they just have a hard
spec in their requirements that says
every component must be 60 C or lower
which is absolutely insane but it also
means that no one will ever complain
about temperatures on a component that
doesn't need to care about temperatures
like an MCU but anyway that's why all
the thermal pads are there even when
they don't need to be the base plates
pretty standard setup except for the
split down the middle so that split is
what allows this part to be removed
taken out and then you can put your LM
two pot on that area of the board while
keeping this on the vrm components you
can see the mosfet and doubler imprints
on this thermal pad which contact two if
we pull this off you'll see it to a
copper plate as seen on the fw three
cards give that pad copper plate here
and on the other side of that there
might be a heat pipe but I'm not 100%
positive just yet now it does not look
like there is there's however a copper
plate and the heat pipes all run through
actually let me kind of angle it this
way you can see that plate here
and then under that there's this copper
plate which is contacting between this
one on the base plate that sinks to the
fins which of course connects to the
heap ice so there's your cooling
solution on that part of the card I'm
not sure we're going to go ahead and
take the rest of this off because
there's really no need to and it gets
very complex with the fan cables and
I'll have time to try and figure out
where everything goes but we can move
along to this part and this we will have
some photos and b-roll of so for this
we've got your MOSFETs here they are
doubled into ten phase doubled and
doctors as you expect capacitors which
they're keeping these cool intentially
sort of almost actively cooled because
does increase lifespan longevity and
then we've got the memory PRM in here as
well so oh and before getting to that
stuff there is a dip switch with a three
BIOS switch now on to BIOS is going to
give you a little bit more room to play
but we don't know the exact details just
yet and then if you're wondering this
side of the card is debug stuff that
will be gone on production model this is
evbot this is your volt reading revolt
readout and then this is a USB 2
connector the CSB 2 connector is
actually really important this is the
same pen out as on a motherboard this
allows you to do voltage control through
software rather than just relying on
evbot for example so if you're worried
about voltage limitations on Pascal or
something like that that's supposed to
help you out on that front of
overclocking but I need to reference
some data X we've got all of these
component parts already so we can go
through those ok so they're using
international rectifier for pretty much
everything it's all IR components the
MOSFETs are ir35 right here IR three
five seven fives and then for the
controller they've got an IR three five
seven zero for the voltage controller is
that
we have ir35 9/5 is another
international rectifier part two five
nine five four the controller voltage
controller and a pax BDD we've got an IR
three eight nine nine and then we also
have information on the doublers that
will be in the article along with any
other stuff that's missing here we'll
put all that in the article hopefully we
can get build joy to analyze this PCB
because it's quite interesting for a lot
of reasons but that gives you all the
basics of the kingpin card and a little
bit more from the show floor of copy
text so to speak
so hopefully that gets our one started
MSRP we don't yet have as that's the
whole rundown of the kingpin PCB in the
cooling solution we'll have more
information in the article as stated
MSRP we don't yet know will update as
soon as we've got that but the card is a
pretty good-looking especially with the
gold plate on the PCB so as always
