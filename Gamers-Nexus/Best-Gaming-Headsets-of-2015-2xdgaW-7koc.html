net and today we're talking about the
best gaming headsets of 2015 and this
includes some headsets from previous
years as well it's just whatever's good
right now our criteria for selection
include analysis of portability for
travel so one of these is pretty good
for that includes FPS focused headsets
RPG focused and those things like that
and all of these have a microphone
attached so that would qualify them as
the gaming headset category and they're
all between 50 and $220 that's our price
range for today starting out at the low
end we have the $50 Plantronics game
comm 780 which I reviewed the 788 maybe
last year and this is technically the
788 but it's the same headset as the 780
the 780 is currently available for $50
the refreshed version which is this one
with different colors basically is about
20 dollars more but if you're gonna buy
one of the others by the 780 because the
same thing and it's 50 bucks which is a
crazy good price for a headset of this
quality so the reason we like the 780 is
because it has lasted us about three
years now and it's used in production so
it's one of the headsets that is
actively used everyday on one of our
workstations for one of the gamers Nexus
staff members and it has survived it's
quite a bit of abuse it's still in
perfect use the mic still works properly
everything's still good which is a bar
for headsets to reach because they are
prone to breaking
so the 780 has got good endurance it's
got superb mic quality actually better
than some of the hundred plus dollar
options up here and that's somewhat
confusing to me I don't know why other
headsets can't match the mic quality but
either way it's very good for Skype
calls and things like that and as far as
the sound quality goes it's pretty solid
you can get pretty far in games like
counter-strike Go which are really just
a one plain two-dimensional soundscape
where you've got basically horizontal
sound emission and if you start needing
more spatial awareness it's probably
time to look at the higher-end headsets
if you want vertical accuracy and
things of that nature it's good to look
into DTS or better dobby support now
this does have Dolby Surround but will
generally disable it for a lot of
different applications because it kind
of muddies the soundscape a little bit
it produces a overwhelming sense of
ambient noise which is undesirable for
games like counter-strike go where you
don't want to ambient noise all you want
is footsteps and things of that nature
so either way the 780 is a very good
headset at 50 bucks but if you step it
up to the next level
there's the $68 SteelSeries Siberia v2
and this is a headset that's been around
for quite a while as the 780 has been
the Siberia v2 is pretty well known in
eSports environments it sees a lot of
you set conventions at vendor booths and
it comes in numerous colors it's a very
simple headset that focuses just on
gaming quality for things like MOBAs and
fps and MMOs and what-have-you where you
don't necessarily need the insane level
of immersion that $150 headset would
provide but you want a little bit more
than a cheaper option would output the
Siberia v2 has an open back design so
it's different from these other headsets
and that means you have some sound
leakage from the ear cups but that's not
necessarily a bad thing it really just
depends on what you want as a user so
with an open back design because there
is no containment for the sound as its
output in the headset you do have
leakage to the sides but it means that
you've got some more awareness to your
surroundings as well so if you prefer to
not be totally isolated in your gaming
world and you want some understanding of
what's going on around you then an open
back design is not a bad consideration
in that instance it does less than it's
usability as a headset you'd want to
wear on a plane for example because you
get more of the engine noise through the
ear cups but it's good for other things
so the SteelSeries BTU is 50 millimeter
drivers and a 3.5 millimeter jack the
Plantronics uses a USB jack
our next headset is the HyperX cloud 2
which is a cue pad headset that was
designed and developed in cooperation
with HyperX a kingston division and the
HyperX cloud 2 is some
reviewed previously and called one of
the most versatile and travel friendly
headsets we've ever worked with this is
actually what I use when I do all the
convention trips so when I go on planes
this is the headset I take and the
reason for that is because it's very
isolating it blocks a lot of the outside
noise with the closed back design and
with the vinyl or leatherette whatever
you want to call it your cups you can
replace these with included foam ear
cups they're a bit more comfortable and
don't get us hot but these block out a
lot of noise which makes them awesome
for travel the headset is also very
durable it can withstand a lot of abuse
because it's a metal frame and none of
the wiring is exposed other than where
the headphones actually connect to the
computer and that wire is braided which
gives it a bit of extra strength and
looks better the cloud 2 makes one major
change from the cloud 1 headset and that
is that this version includes a 7.1
sound mixer in the form of a dongle that
connects inline to the cable and that
has the Dolby Surround technology in it
you can toggle it with a button and that
adds some virtualization of your
positional audio the HyperX cloud 2 is a
$100 headset and our next headset jumps
up to $150 but it has a $130 variant so
this is my current favorite headset it's
what I'm using right now as I'm
reviewing it and it's the corsair void
wireless SE there is a non SE version
which omits the inclusion of a wireless
range extender
that's $130 so you you've lose $20 on
the price in exchange for losing that
wireless range extender this headset is
wireless as I've just said a few times
it's also got RGB lights in it so it's
the first headset and our lineup to have
RGB lights if that's something that
interests you you can also disable them
if not the headset connects to micro USB
and then USB on the other side for
charging but you can use it wired if you
run out of charge however in my testing
so far I found that the battery has
lasted a little over 13 hours it might
push to 14 but I've gotten some beeps
that indicate it will die soon and
testing so either way more than 10 hours
of battery life and that is with the RGB
light and enabled and with constant use
for music or games or microphone input
the void offers excellent frequency
tuning options through software if you
want to tune for different frequencies
for example footsteps and FPS games or
gunshots or bass your dungeon noises for
Skyrim things like that you can tune
through the software setup and then the
rest is done with Dolby Surround there
is no DTS headphone X in this headset as
there is not in any of the other
headsets we've discussed so far but
there is DTS headphone X in the next one
which is the Logitech G's 633 a $150
wired headset the G 633 is a brand new
headset it's got a wireless brother the
Jean line 33 for $200 although on
Amazon's 250 right now because of supply
and demand and at $150 it is one of the
only RGB headsets on the market
alongside the Corsair void it's got
slightly more audio output capabilities
than the void does in some ways and one
of those is a DTS headphone X which is a
surround virtualization technology
similar to Dolby but a little bit more
effective we think for gaming so this
does positional audio simulation so that
you have effectively a speaker on the
top right top left the middle the back
and the sides things of that nature so
it's a 7.1 virtualized setup and then
you can configure that for different
modes so wide or front audio depending
on the type of game you're playing this
is very useful in some games like
titanfall for example where you have a
lot of vertical movement this gives you
a bit of an edge in positional audio
locating where your enemies are
vertically and horizontally but it's not
great for some other games again csgo is
a classic example because in a game like
csgo you really just have one plane of
audio output and you you don't want any
ambient noise to muddy your ability to
locate enemies all you're caring about
in csgo matches is the nearest threat we
encountered a few issues with it but
nothing too bad it just kind of depends
on what you're looking for in a headset
so check out the review before I buy
there and then the final headset in our
lineup is from a pro audio company Audio
Technica and they are in direct
competition with another pro audio
company sennheiser for a high
gaming headset in the $200 price bracket
the audio technica g1 directly competes
with the Sennheiser game 0 and their
price about the same they're both
high-end audio solutions that output
superior audio quality to any of these
but they're more expensive so you're
spending two hundred to two hundred
twenty dollars and the major difference
between the two is that the Sennheiser
headset uses a different back design as
you can see here and the audio technica
one has both open and closed back
designs if you have a preference between
the two the Sennheiser headset also has
a higher impedance rating so you do want
some kind of amp in your line to amplify
the signal so that you can get the same
audio level output as the audio
Technica's g1 the g1 has a lower
impedance so you can get a louder audio
output from the headset when looking at
the decibel output level that's all for
