gamers nexus i'm here on day two of
packs at the far cry 4 booth I just had
some hands-on time with the game and I
can say that there's a lot to be excited
about with this first of all there's a
lot of motion blur that's very polished
a lot of great lighting effects particle
effects when you fire your gun on the
environments destructible environments
so it's very immersive in that sense the
map that I just played is a I guess some
sort of shangri-la fortress so there's a
lot of like scalability you can climb
and scale the the maps gain tactical
advantages they're actually a couple of
ways to enter the fortress when I had to
go in there and reach my objective point
and destroy the chopper I finally got
the best of the chopper took a little
while and i found a grenade launcher but
anyway you can kind of charge into these
situations and one great way to do that
is actually riding an elephant into the
fortress so I happen to do that and you
get in the elephant has like what the
controller you can actually like swing
its trunk and like step on guys and
attack them that way so that's pretty
fun or you can fire your gun that way so
i dismounted snuck into the back after
causes some initial havoc and then I
just went to town you know ducking
behind structures and moving around just
keep the enemies guessing the AI is
actually pretty smart in this game so
bill summon reinforcements the
reinforcements will charge at you but
they're not just kind of like mindlessly
blitz you and you know get mowed down
that way so they'll be kind of hiding
around as well and you'll have to you
know use the map and also kind of guess
what their actions will be in in order
to find a tactical advantage and then
gunned them down or knife and from there
yeah so this level right here I had
actually play it I think three or four
times so it's definitely challenging but
as I mentioned earlier there are a
couple of ways to approach each battle
situation for this so there's lots to
look forward to from my time here with
far cry 3 but well up see what else they
have to announce in the months ahead so
be sure to take a look at what we have
going on at pax and this day too we're
not done yet
stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
