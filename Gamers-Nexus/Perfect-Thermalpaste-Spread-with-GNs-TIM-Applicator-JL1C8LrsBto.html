looking at some new tools that we got in
these are silk screens we have a couple
different ones different generations of
liquid coolers and the idea here is
we'll use these in the future to reapply
if they're on pace to the cold plate of
a liquid cooler and the point of that
rather than just using one of these or
something and kind of putting it on the
surface and tightening the the device
down the idea is that it will allow us
to do more like for like testing with
cooling to make sure that the thermal
paste application is not an interfering
factor in our test methodology talk
about that more in a second before
getting to the content this is brought
to you by iBUYPOWER
and their new element in gaming PC which
has the arc LED fans under glow lighting
and large tempered glass windows okay so
the point of this is to improve our
thermal testing methodology it's already
pretty good we've done videos on in the
past if you haven't seen it but this
specifically will allow us to for
example test one of these out of the box
when we first get it and then maybe a
year from now we want to do regression
testing which would be basically pulling
all the components out retesting them
for various reasons one can be has
liquid permeated is there a loss of
liquid whatever or maybe we just changed
test platforms and we need to retest CPU
aging all that kind of stuff so in such
test environments one concern would be
the thermal paste because when we apply
its stock from the factory that's
obviously the most representative of
real-world user scenario but when we go
apply it later for regression testing
different application methods might have
a half a degree to one degree Celsius
swing if I apply it myself first as easy
as the factory did even my own
application methods could vary a little
bit from test to test and it's not a
huge difference in general as long as
you kind of have a routine that you do
when you apply their own compound but
it's enough where we want to just
eliminate that variance from testing so
I have not used these yet and we're
gonna try this out today this is a
silkscreen this is what a Sutekh uses in
their factory for applying compound to
their CLC cold blades and basically this
is
this is an EVGA one specifically which I
just chose to be use it for the 1060
recently and I took it off so you can
see here that kind of cut out in the
surface and that matches the drill pad
the screw pattern for the underside near
the cold plate so we can put these
together and that's just a silkscreen
like you'd use for a shirt they go
together let's see if I can show that on
camera go together just like this pretty
much a perfect fits got four spots for
the mounting holes in the corners and
then you end up with that on the surface
so then we can put the pace down apply
it with one of these which is just like
an acrylic scoop that happens to be the
same size as that and I don't I don't
know why I guess they just had extra
metal and acrylic lying around because
it does seem a bit overkill for this
this purpose but that's what we got so
that's one option we have these these
are Gen 5 so these are for Gen 5 liquid
coolers from ASA Tech these are for
Janet for liquid coolers and the ACE the
EVGA one is sort of a four point five
something like that it's a little bit
different so we've got these NZXT ones
Corsair coolers the H 100 I some of
those coolers use use stuff that we
could actually use these on for reapply
and thermal paste so a pretty good range
of coolers we can use this on so let's
try it out do not try to yet so we'll
see if it works this by the way just in
further effort of keeping very
consistent test methodology that is
actually the same compound that's used
on these coolers so that too is the same
so at this point we're basically
applying the same compound in the same
fashion that ASA tech would do for
Corsair NZXT liquid coolers so we should
have a pretty good means of representing
those products as they arrive from the
factory
let's see how this goes not super green
oh there it goes
sweet
that's a lot of excess I feel like I'm
gonna make my own spreader or something
this seems terribly inefficient but it's
clearly working it's going through the
screen see if we can do this a little
better so there's a lot of compound loss
here so I'm gonna try and fix that in
our own updated version of this but for
a baseline it's not bad I really do do
it just with plastic utensils more or
less sweet that's looking pretty good
so cool thing about this I'm not sure
how well it shows up on camera but we've
got a pretty even spread of this stuff
across the service and it's not coming
up when I run the thing back across it
so there's no issue we're doing this is
picking back up the compound that's
already been spread and that's just
because it's pushed through the screen
already so we're not touching it so
let's let's separate these carefully and
see how well it works not bad you could
certainly do a little bit better right
there but I mean really if you've seen a
lot of these things like we have I've
shown a lot of them certainly the spread
pattern other than the there's a little
bit of imperfection out at the edges a
little bit of imperfection there's the
first time using it but the spread
pattern if you look at the compound
itself is the same as what we get from
the factory and what I mean by that is
you can see the little dots in it
there's little dots or just from the
silkscreen
so that's pretty sweet it actually works
and I think I've even cut I threw it on
the ground so I've even got these I
haven't thrown them all away so I we
could basically put compound bow to come
on when we're done testing we're doing a
hybrid build and reseal it like that and
it's basically a brand new unit so
that's pretty damn cool I'm excited
about that
that's good for storage too because now
I can keep them all in the same place
and I won't be sorting through which
ones have been used and which haven't so
I think that pretty much takes care of
that again could certainly spread it a
little more evenly but you get the idea
we can use this for our upcoming liquid
cooler roundup as well where we're gonna
be showing some of the old stuff
retested yeah not bad so what I just did
there has resolved some of the issues
down the corner I'm happy with that just
a special custom-made tool that we're
gonna be using for future content you're
probably not gonna see a lot of it in
the a role in the future but this will
show you how it works so if you ever
curious why we're able to reuse the same
cooler and have it looking exactly like
it does from the factory rather than
putting it blob down which is certainly
fine but for testing that's going to be
more accurate to what we get unday one
now you'll know how that happens so as
always thank you for watching patreon
link the booth show video on how was
that directly subscribed for more
content part three of the the hybrid
builders titan x is either online
already when you see this or will be
coming very soon so check for that I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
