Jian episode we're still working on
finalizing the set here we're actually
about to rotate and go back to a 45
degree angle shot putting a shelf over
here you'll see more on that soon
but as always leave your questions in
the comment section below for next
episode filming three today one is going
up for the patreon bonus episode that's
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus to get
access to that and then two here on the
main channel so let's get into the
questions for this week before that this
video is brought to you by it the NZXT e
series power supplies the e series PS
use our high end power supplies with
real-time digital voltage and
temperature monitoring / rail wattage
measurements and data logging
functionality for power usage the E
series PSU is also come with a 10 year
warranty all the way down to the 500
watt unit and they run fully modular and
with silent fan operating modes learn
more at the link below first a quick
note a lot of you asked about when we'd
be getting these back in stock the G n
cobalt blue beer glass with a gold trim
around the outside top of it so they're
back in stock you've been asking for a
couple weeks now thank you for your
patience the first round was kind of a
trial we sold out in like 14 hours or
something it's pretty crazy but they're
back in now so you gotta store it on
cara's access Nets pick up one of these
if you like them we should have enough
for at least a little while and we'll
see how the demand is but they've been
going pretty quickly so far but now
they'll probably go even faster either
way they're back in mod mats we still
have a good couple left until the we'll
hit a pause before the next production
run so if you get that order in soon
you'll get that as well anyway first
question is actually a very good one and
it is from Nick Kirin II Nick said hey
Steven your recent interview with David
Cantor you guys talked about how at one
point the foundries added FinFETs
to their process I was wondering what
exactly is a FinFET and how is it
beneficial to CPUs and GPUs so this
question is one that I answered back and
asked at number26 I had to go look it up
quite old at this point honestly my
answer I didn't rewatch it but it
probably wasn't quite as detailed as as
it can be today so we'll revisit this
one this is something where David cancer
would be excellent as a source but I'm
going to put in
my version of this first get you all the
basics and then they will revisit it if
there's enough interest for the future
so FinFETs first of all this is a thin
field effect transistor which can be
thought of as 3d rather than planar or a
flat plane the big shift was from 28
nanometer planar process nodes to 16
nanometer FinFET for things like Pascal
for instance which is largely where
Nvidia's power savings came from
infinite process a silicon fin protrudes
upwards and it acts as an electrode
FinFET processes reduce power leakage by
using a three-dimensional design wherein
a fin protrudes to form the drain and
the source with a gate circling around
the transistors fins you can think of it
like a literal thin as an ax dorsal fin
or something like that like a shark fin
that sort of helps to guide the flow of
power and reduce leakage FinFETs
therefore also increased per core
performance per watt and moving to fin
vet lowered voltage requirements as an
example to 0.8 volts at the lower end
rather than the previous 1.0 volts at
the low end for the previous process
they're still using double patterning
lithography for FinFETs as we don't yet
have extreme ultraviolet functional in
any meaningful capacity but the gate
design is significantly reducing power
leakage and voltage requirements FinFETs
use it more conducting channels than
planar transistors leading to reduced
switching voltage as mentioned in the
0.8 volt low end for Pascal GPUs earlier
up to 1/2 the power requirement as well
by the way with some FinFETs and reduced
leakage overall so if in FETs are
critical for the modern moves and in the
most recent GPUs not counting what's
obviously coming up at this point so not
counting that stuff that we don't have
eyesight to do at this point the
previous GPU switches from 28 and then
downward a lot of the power saving gains
that was from FinFET a lot of it was
just from process changes in general a
lot of it was from architectural
optimization with Pascal or with Vega
there were obviously some changes versus
previous architectures Polaris and PG so
some of its architectural but a lot of
it does come
to the process technology so FinFETs are
you can just the very simple version of
it is going to fin fat you're coming
from something else the other thing
you're coming from is planar so you came
from a planar transistor which is it's
literally a plane it's effectively
two-dimensional and with thin fat it's
more or less three-dimensional and there
are some images we should have shown by
now to illustrate that so you can kind
of think of the fin as almost being like
just think of it like a bucket it kind
of helps reduce leakage by acting like a
bucket and and that's a large part of
the power optimization has reduced
leakage reduce voltage requirements
stuff like that so that's a big thing
with nymphets
there's more here but that's that's kind
of where I'm gonna stop at my current
knowledge shuffle anyway so that's
hopefully that helps you out next
question is from TM he says can you not
answer questions that are easily Google
and verified within five to ten minutes
of reading results in forums like the
watt per meter Kelvin 1gb if they don't
phase passive cooling heating the room
blah blah blah
that's all line is tech tip stuff all
right so first thing mr. TM why don't
you try posting one if you have such
good questions that are better than
everyone else's that no one has ever
come up with an answer to and it's not
on Google anywhere post your question
that would be more useful secondly so a
big thing here these videos the ask G
ends it's not supposed to contain like
groundbreaking revolutionary information
that you could never find anywhere ever
before that's not the point the point is
you're getting information from a source
that you already watch for other content
or I get it from someone who is a
verified expert like David cancer in the
previous the ten nanometers discussion
and that's where hopefully you get some
value I mean the you talk about the watt
per meter Kelvin one thermal
conductivity so the whole point of that
question it wasn't what is watts per
meter Kelvin because the answer is
thermal conductivity although some
people seem to think that it was what
does that mean so okay we know we know
that their own conductivity watts per
Kelvin same thing but what does it
actually mean and so that's where I want
spoke to
ESG and got a great answer from VSG who
is a thermodynamics expert and was able
to answer it hopefully with a bit of
fine tuning for our industry so that's
the thing with these questions sure you
can go google thermal conductivity and
eventually you get to the answer you
want or you come to our content where
we're very focused on the specific
application of computer hardware and
boil it down to the important components
and talk about those or maybe throw in
some interesting side notes and things
like that
so yeah not really the point there is
very little I could answer that you
can't find on Google because there's a
lot of stuff on Google so sorry to
disappoint you leave your groundbreaking
question below and we'll talk about it
next time
WG what is it the silicon lottery why
does it exist how does it impact
consumers well WG unfortunately I'm not
allowed to answer this question because
you could google it apparently from a
previous expert so the the silicon
lottery no no either
there was a great comment though about
does he look like a plastic surgeon I
love that comment thank you the silicon
lottery is so what is it why does it
exist how does it impact consumers is
the question it's the main immediate
thing here with the silicon lottery is
that you have to know kind of where this
stuff comes from CPUs and GPUs they're
not created equal the spec might be the
same but the actual quality of the
silicon you might hear the term ASIC
quality with GPUs that refers basically
to this and the quality of the silicon
can vary from individual part to
individual part despite being the same
skew ie 8700 K Vega 56 whatever and it's
true for memory too by the way that's
why you have some memory that performs
better than others despite being the
same spec when you start overclocking so
silicon madhuri then ultimately the cpu
that you have or GPU it is diced from a
wafer so wafer is a big circular disk
that's those super colorful things that
we see that is cut out of a silicon
crystal it's a synthetic crystal it's
grown it can be grown in a lab and they
cut Louise into wafers horizontally and
then from there you dice the
sometimes we referred plurally to as
dice to pay on who you ask but they cut
the dyes and that's your silicon now
getting into why the silicon lottery
exists answer the question if you cut
let's say we cut sort of towards the
middle of the wafer as opposed to the
outer edge of the wafer the middle of
the wafer is actually prime real estate
it's worth a lot more server memory
typically comes from the middle of the
wafer it is a obviously because it's a
circle there's less real estate in the
dead center and that's where the
lithography is the most accurate so
lithography when making these components
when making the silicon components way
more accurate at the center you end up
with higher quality components higher
quality silicon and for things that are
very intensive or you have specific
requirements again like server memory
that's where they'll pull those from and
then the consumer memory comes from the
outer edge or as close to the outer
edges they can get before it becomes
just unusable so that's number one
number one for why does the silicon
lottery exist is because it comes down
to manufacturing and if you cut stuff
like towards the center versus the
outside it does actually differ in
quality so volt frequency is kind of a
place where you can see silicon Lottery
comment to play I believe part of the
question was how does it impact
consumers at the end of the day if you
buy an 87 or kr 770 hundred it'll hit
spec that's what they're meant to do but
overclocking is where it impacts
consumers and then once you start
overclocking it your volt frequency
curve is what looks different so if you
have a golden sample as it's called a
really good chip you might have a volt
frequency curve on an eighty eighty six
K that's something like at the very high
end maybe you're able to hit 5.3
gigahertz that's only like one point two
seven volts which is extremely good very
uncommon and so that would be an example
of a good bin or of just a silicon
lottery when you you've won the silicon
lottery at this point a bad example
might be something like you're able to
hit spec and you can maybe overclock
actually we had one our 8700 K
originally hit 4.9 gigahertz 1.4
something volts not very good kind of
lost silicon lottery so some of that
comes down to maybe it was just on a bad
part of the
wait was that towards the outer edge of
the wafer or something like that or it's
just some other manufacturing tolerances
so there's still multi patterning going
on here multi patterning for lithography
can introduce error it's something that
we talked about in our 10 nanometer
discussion with David cancer if you're
curious about multi or quad patterning
or something like that we talked about
it there and that's that's another area
where error or just quality differences
can be introduced some of them are bad
enough that the chip gets thrown out and
some of them are bad enough that it it
still gets produced but it's just not
going to overclock very well or might
have might get pushed down the product
line maybe instead of being a high-end
part it becomes a low-end part and they
just turn off some features so that's
another thing that can happen with
manufacturing tolerances some may be a
core is defective they just disable it
fuse it off and then you get something
like an i3 or an r3 or whatever instead
or they could all be perfectly
functional and they just few stuff off
to fuse stuff off so there's some kind
of product segmentation so that it's
actually a profitable to make all this
stuff so hopefully that answers the
basics of it the silicon lottery at the
very heart of it when people talk about
it they're talking about how high of a
frequency can they get with how low a
voltage so it's a sustained high
frequency with a sustained low voltage
that's what you're going for if you get
really good numbers on both high
frequency low voltage then you won the
silicon lottery and it's not like it's a
literal lottery anything like that it's
just it's manufacturing tolerances end
of the day so how well does it all come
out of the line when you get your hands
on it does it overclock better than
expected or average or whatever so
that's that's the hopefully a decent
answer for you for that next to us from
Applejack who said Steve are you open to
the idea of selling a gamer's Nexus at
mod matte mini actually yes we've been
working on a medium mod matte for quite
a while now like half a year probably
production takes a while we've made
multiple samples we're trying to get it
as good as we can basically get it to
perfect before we start selling it and
list it so that will be 32 by 16 for the
medium mod matte in inches freedom units
so 32 by 16 as opposed to the current
one which is 4 feet by 2 feet so we're
cutting it down a bit little
fit better on people who have desks that
are a bit smaller so hopefully that that
works out for all of you we're just
waiting on some final sampling at this
point hopefully this next sample is
perfect and we can start making it and
have it
hopefully in production well before end
of year I would like to see that anyway
next question is from max VLA who says
if we have vintage computer component
posters we'd like to donate how do we do
so so this is in reference to last
episode I think where I talked about
wanting to decorate some of the either
the set or just the office in general
with some older component posters as an
option for now you can just I guess post
a comment below or actually you know
what's best is tweeting at us just tweet
at gamers Nexus let me know what you
have and we'll figure it out I don't
have a peel box presently we have people
ship stuff to FedEx or UPS location
locally and I go pick it up so we can do
that or if there are enough of you who
just post in the comments or tweet at me
where it makes more sense to open him
he'll box I'll do that and I'll announce
it in one of the next episodes in a
couple weeks probably when I have time
to go open one of those up and then we
can just give you an address to send
stuff to next one is from hsj I guess to
close that out let me know the interest
from multiple people from like all of
you who want to do that that way I can
gauge whether or not I need to just
email one person and give them a FedEx
GPS address whatever or if we need to
open something that's better for for a
lot of people HS Jason how to determine
the phase design on VRMs on motherboards
because you can't simply count the
number of chokes and call it a day
that's definitely correct and I used to
think it was done that way and I think
it's it's pretty fair that you might
think that because if you're just
getting into it and all you cease
marketing language say in fourteen
phases or whatever and then you kind of
try and figure out where is that number
coming from and you count the chokes a
lot of times it might come out to 14 so
yeah definitely that's that's where I
started with my understanding of it and
I think probably a lot of other people
too but we learned and some of the
things we've learned if you really want
to be accurate with it and you don't
have a better way to validate something
that I've done for builds I'd he does
the vrm analysis videos for our channel
if he can't figure something out by
looking at it because he often doesn't
have the board from me he'll tell me to
start
in around at the components on the board
with a DMA digital multimeter and figure
out where they all go so you if you have
the board in hand it's a bit easier to
work with because you can start probing
different legs on the on the components
like on the inductors and try and figure
out how many phases are able to
communicate with each other so for
example let's say we know there's B core
vrm maybe it's an Intel board so you
have si and IO its name the board you
have V core and SOC so you kind of
figure out how big do you think those
miner rails are and then you just start
probing around that area
I'm like the far right of the VR I'm on
the far left of the VR I'm because
you're not gonna split Veet core in the
middle with like VSA or something like
that
so VCCS a so it's you just find the edge
left to right edge bottom edge whatever
that's probably where one of your miner
rails is and you can probe those and
what you're looking for is figuring out
which ones are connected to which vrm
which which component legs SMD legs and
to do that you're just doing a
resistance check so you're just looking
to see if they are continuous basically
and build Zoid has a great video on his
channel that's about how to do this and
how to identify vrm phases and I would
highly recommend you watch it go over to
actually hardcore overclock and check
out his video on this he did one for us
too that was a bit of a slightly
different topic but if you look up our
intel hades canyon nook and you see no
hades canyon vrm analysis probably just
hate his canyon vrm analysis type that
in he has a video explaining how he does
some of the identification of different
miner rails and major rails and things
like that because that board was kind of
complex it was difficult as non-standard
for a motherboard obviously so that's a
good video to get some ideas on what you
can do if you're trying not to do actual
measuring of stuff like taking
resistance checks for example you can
start looking at things like doublers so
hopefully it's not a quadruple or
they're pretty rare but typically you
see those small chips that are kind of
seated it's it's normally like on a GPU
it'd be like capacitor bank conductors
MOSFETs and then just very few
sparsely-populated doublers if they have
doublers
and that makes it pretty easy / - but it
could be a quadruple er it could be the
memory prm's a bit bigger so if you're
not trying to probe stuff you can look
at oftentimes the memory of erm on like
a GPU will change the inductor or the
choke or sorry the inductor menchaca
same thing the inductor or the MOSFET
and very slight change is a lot of time
so if you see the change in component
you can read the text on it see that
it's a different MOSFET than all the
ones below it you know that's part of
the memory of erm and so you can just
start isolating from there so that's
memory of erm with a different two
different MOSFETs and the vcore vrm
MOSFETs so we put that out to the side
ignore it and then you're left with
maybe eight more MOSFETs and some
doublers and then you know you might
have a four phase that's double there's
something like that but otherwise
resistance checks the best way to do it
and check build Zoids video for more on
that as he is quite the expert next one
is from Kevin Cusick who says with the
upcoming Intel CPUs potentially keeping
hyper-threading as an exclusive for the
i9 now with an exclusive price to match
probably how many cores do you need such
that hyper threading no longer brings
benefits for gaming so years ago and
still occasionally hyper threading was
actually detrimental to performance and
I'm talking like when it first came out
basically so hyper threading had some
slight overhead such that when enabling
it you could actually lose a bit off of
average FPS you're not talking a lot it
was less than 5% in almost all cases but
it happened things have improved a lot
Rison went through the same thing Rison
first came out disabling SMT
simultaneous multithreading
same thing basically disabling SMT would
sometimes give you like 20 30 percent
more performance in some games and that
was largely resolved with later a BIOS
update it's AG ISA updates all that
stuff but the point is on both platforms
there is history of being worse with
their version of SMT which is sort of
the generic brand of it
so Tanner's the question these days rise
in an Intel both have had enough
improvement software developers have
optimized enough that hyper threading in
essence he actually do in a lot of cases
benefit but there is definitely a point
of diminishing returns that's the
question obviously quick cut there I had
to help with something
so hopefully I can remember where I was
but anyway getting back into it I'll
recap a bit of it but applications like
blender they definitely can make use of
the extra threads even if it's hyper
threading which isn't really a true core
but it will show a difference for sure
because blender just wants threads so it
depends on what you're doing Cinebench
is another good example set them to the
same frequency let them rip and the one
with more threads generally speaking if
we're talking 8687 or EK same frequency
there will be a benefit to having the
extra threads at some point you start
choking if if there are too many threads
and not enough frequency in some
applications like xeon cpus some of the
older x79 Zeon's that were maybe
something like what were they even with
twelve core I think there are 12 core
might have been ten but let's call it
ten I know there was 10 cores young for
x79 though is that like three gigahertz
10 cores 20 threads for something like
premiere far worse than a four core with
a higher frequency so it all depends on
what you're doing but that out of the
way that aside the answer to your
question the majority of games are still
stuck at four threads a lot of them
especially with modern CryEngine modern
Unreal Engine they're capable of using
eight threads and will do so very
effectively so for CryEngine as example
this is the first one that really
started moving towards eight threads
it's kind of gone these days
unfortunately but CryEngine had a
dedicated thread for rendering for draw
calls things like that
dedicated thread for physics for game
logic for audio for whatever else needed
to be done a iowa's typically done under
logic but you'd have eight threads and
up to that point it actually did make a
difference and it wasn't the ministry in
returns and once you unpassed that it
was diminishing returns because they
just it wouldn't get juggled were
scheduled properly same is true for
Unreal Engine these days it'll it's
capable of using the thread count just
kind of depends on at some level what
the game is and what kind of changes the
developers have made outside of the
engine but to answer the question though
a lot of games are stuck at four threads
but I would say to very directly answer
this you said how many cores do you need
such that hyper threading no longer
brings any benefits for gaming you
weren't asking art for production so for
gaming I would put it at about six cores
these days like there are a lot of games
we've tested and and there are
benchmarks on our site and on the
YouTube channel destiny I think comes to
mind spend
where the 8600 K and the 8700 K over
clock to the same frequency would more
or less produce the same result it's not
always true definitely not there are
instances where the low-end performance
like your frame time performance frame
time consistency what we call 1% Louis
point 1 percent lower just frame times
in general and consistency of them there
are absolutely instances we're having
the extra threads and hyper threading
there can help pick up some of the
low-end performance and level out your
frame time consistency a bit but if it's
sufficiently fast as a processor and you
have sufficient core count the amount
that changes things is really heavily
dictated by the game and in a lot of
cases they're close enough that in 8680
700k I had a same frequency let's say
5.0 gigahertz if the games not using the
extra threads they're basically the same
in performance and we've shown that time
and again I can't remember Final Fantasy
might have been another one wasn't a
great game to test in general but that's
the real world not every game was
perfectly optimized and that was another
one of those so hopefully that gives you
an idea basically I would peg it at
about 6 for the answer for sort of the
newer higher-end better built engines
and then for for a lot of stuff that's
still out there and you remember keep in
mind games are in development for five
plus years at a time so it could take a
while for things to really start
switching over but that's it for this
one as always you get a stored on camera
sacks it's done that to make F one of
our new at GN beer glasses we've just
restocked cobalt blue color with the
gold trim and we do have plenty of other
things there as well like the mod mats
we've got this shirt the blue print
shirt we have the graph logo shirt all
that stuff go to patreon.com/scishow and
XS to get the bonus episode and
subscribe right here on this channel for
the second public episode of sgn that'll
be going up shortly if not already thank
you for the great questions this week
leave more below for next week I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
