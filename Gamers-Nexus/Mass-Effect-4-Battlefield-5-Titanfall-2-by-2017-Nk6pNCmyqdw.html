earnings call transcripts for its fiscal
third-quarter which are all words that
are very exciting and compelling I'm
sure and this revealed the company's
scheduled game launches through quarter
2 of 2017 on the roster is critically
acclaimed Mass Effect the next
installment of battlefield and titanfall
and probably titanfall is one of the
most hyped IPS over the last few years
but kind of slowly fizzled out to a
shell of its original multiplayer
community Mass Effect Andromeda or
effectively Mass Effect 4 will be
released by April of 2017 the same is
true for titanfall targeting April of
2017 or before as a launch date and
titanfall is currently in development by
respawn games as the second iteration of
their new IP we knew that titanfall 2 is
slated for a multi-platform launch and
know that it will retain its focus on
parkour inspired fast-paced shooter
gameplay the game is being developed by
respawn comprised of several x
Activision employees including
high-profile former executives like
Vince Zampella and Jason West Mass
Effect Andromeda is somewhat of a reboot
for the series not much is presently
known about the game setting or gameplay
direction but it's coming and it will be
a bit of a reboot as for battlefield 5
or whatever it ends up being called
that's Duke quote in time for the
holidays likely around October EA games
also spent considerable time talking
about eSports and it's competitive
gaming plans for fiscal year 2017 the
company is looking toward its shooter
titles and sports titles even for growth
