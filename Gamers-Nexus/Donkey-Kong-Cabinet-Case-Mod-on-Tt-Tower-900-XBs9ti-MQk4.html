Sweta CES 2017 had another video looking
at some of their new products this is
just more fun we're looking at a case
mod done by thermal Mike he works at
thermal take as the name might suggest
we've interviewed him before but this
case model was thrown together in three
days for CES he really had no time at
all before getting to the case mod this
coverage is brought to you by cyber
power and there's cyber excel gaming PC
which has an invertible motherboard tray
layout and a couple of other cool
features hit the link in the description
below for more information so getting to
the case this is one of their tower 900
cases for the base unit that was
modified in his three day cycle Mike
first started with the painting because
this is a non-standard color he had the
paint first make sure it would dry in
time for the build and he was waiting
for the Z 270 motherboard anyway because
at the time this was being done that was
still under NDA this is an ACC 270
maximus 9 and we don't we haven't looked
at one of those yet but this is one of
the newer boards obviously another mod
if it isn't clear as a donkey con mod
based on the original game and the red
tubing here that represents the staging
for the level is actually one thousand
millimeter uncut Bend so this took three
tries to get right and I imagine pretty
frustrating given the time constraint
but it's $1,000 uncut Bend the blue
tubes in the back represent the ladders
I think there are slightly different
colleagues took some liberties but you
get the idea in terms of the other cool
things these barrels on here were
actually just bought for train set she's
like model train set bought for a train
set from Amazon couple bucks he stained
them and used double-sided tape to stick
it to the tubes and then there's a Mario
down here just from some of the TT
offices with the mallet which is
actually really cool this vinyl on the
outside is done by a cabinet maker so
it's an actual would be made for a
cabinet vinyl on the outside of the case
representing the original Donkey Kong
vinyl cabinet cover and up here if it's
in shot if not we'll get b-roll there's
a box that's made out of just wood and
then the front panel where it has the
backlit Donkey Kong
branding is actually cut from an acrylic
window from the core p5 or p3 one of
those cases they actually cannibalize
another one of the cases for that
there's switch in the back for RGB
control in the bottom front I'm gonna
put the mic next to this for a second
because there's a button that plays the
sound from the game so let's just do
that really quickly so there's that
there's the sound from the enclosure I
think that pretty much covers it it's a
really sweet case that are for 140
millimeter fans in the back on either
side for the radiators there's another
one
140 in the top there's all TT fans of
course and I guess to mention the loops
there are two separate loops so it's not
a single loop like most open look what
you used to it's two separate loops
isolates of GP on the cpu but the fun
thing here is that the GPUs are actually
fake so these are made out of kind of
like a plastic with a taps drilled in
them for the mounting block for the oval
of liquid block that goes on the top so
TT is able to demonstrate their block
without actually needing the video cards
which is really clever and I might steal
that idea for our own video production
in the future so those are fake the
board's real CB is real liquid real a
regardless of being fake cards they're
talking about making them functional for
packs anyway so if you're planning on
watching our PAX East coverage or prime
or whatever this may be at they might
actually real cards at that point maybe
10 80s or Vega even which would be
definitely interesting the mod is pretty
sweet though if you want to check out
our other CES coverage as always that
just go to the channel subscribe for
more thank you for watching I'll see you
all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
