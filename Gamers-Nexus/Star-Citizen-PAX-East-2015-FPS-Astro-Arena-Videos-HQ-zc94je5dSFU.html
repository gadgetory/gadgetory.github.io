nexus donna and we just got back from
the star citizen PAX East event as put
on by cloud imperium games which saw
chris roberts up on stage showcasing the
PTU 1.1 build which is officially being
branded as star citizen now dropping the
arena commander named as the game
advances into the persistent universe
and this is leading into updates later
in the year including the 2 point 0
update that will feature multi cruise
ships so that's targeted for sometime
around summer but obviously they don't
tend to stick to their own release
schedule so there's no guarantee on that
in terms of what was announced tonight
the old damage tech required predefined
25 50 75 and 100 percent damage states
with individual LEDs or levels of detail
settings and that is no longer required
with the new damage model that Chris
proposed in tonight's presentation which
now uses logical detachable breakable
sections that take procedural damage and
ultimately it actually will reflect
deformation and thickness and
temperature and it even shows burn from
laser shots or effectively the
equivalent of cauterization on the metal
Chris noted that each of these models
needs its own LEDs or level of detail
and there's more than 10 parts with 5
damaged States 5 LEDs 250 plus meshes
per ship which is a huge amount of data
and in testing they were storing almost
100 megabytes of data on disk for each
ship which is fairly tremendous because
when you're dealing with network traffic
as star citizen does that poses a
concern for bandwidth so that's
something that they're working on
resolving so that was the damage
technology they also walked around a new
environment which is a which is shown
here in the video and perhaps most
interestingly star citizen's team showed
off the retaliate er which is a fairly
high-end ship showcased here on the
screen and this is now Hannah ready with
all the specifications revealed we've
published these specifications of the
ship in the article link to the
description below further from this the
next star citizen launches include
ground war and a refactoring of the
constellation and freelancer which will
bring both of these to the level of
quality as the retaliate er as seen in
this video this is all done by the the
retaliator done by the foundry UK guys
finally the first person shooter quality
was upgraded so you can see on the
screen the difference from the
Australian event hosted a little bit ago
showing the FPS module 2 now where
they've highly increased the fidelity of
first-person mode they've increased the
HUD it's a little bit more advanced
looking now and there's all sorts of
animation upgrades as well that have
improved the character animation
externally as it appears to you and
other players this includes a full
muscle system which allows for more
realistic movement of the characters we
have more information on zero-g movement
the FPS module a new sports setting in
the game which is somewhat interesting
to say say it one way and that is all
detailed in the item linked in the
description below please check that out
