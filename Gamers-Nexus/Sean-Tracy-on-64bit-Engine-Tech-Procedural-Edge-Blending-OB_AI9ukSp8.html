with technical director Sean Tracy from
cloud Imperium games even if you're not
interested in star citizen right now the
interviews should be pretty interesting
because it contains information about
64-bit coordinates and world space and
what is a 64-bit engine we talked about
meshes and textures and mapping all this
stuff load processing and management
before getting to this coverage it is
brought to you by an tech and their new
mini ITX cube case designed by Razer
it's got an aluminum shell acrylic
windows on the sides and it should be
available shortly so just as an FYI part
2 of this interview will go up on
Wednesday and that will include the
character technology that's been updated
for citizencon
and also load management on the CPU
threading pins like that so without
further ado I will let you get to part 1
of the interview hey everyone we're here
at the cloud Imperium games offices near
Santa Monica and LA I guess I don't
really know where we are I'm joined by
Shawn Tracy from CI G and we just talked
with Chris Roberts of course so that
video will be on the channel now we're
gonna be going more technical so the
first kind of question would be not in
our interview with Chris he mentioned
the concept of I used the word CryEngine
yeah which kind of response was not
really crying anymore yeah right so the
working title we had then was star
engine so yeah so storage has been kind
of bounced around I don't know how how
absolutely official it is or anything
like that but yeah I mean it's a pretty
different version than what the
CryEngine is we branched quite a while
ago so we haven't taken a new CryEngine
version for quite some time it's about
the 3.7 3.8 area of CryEngine so this
was this was early last year it might
have been before that where we branched
off so we branched off entirely because
it was getting really difficult to take
the integrations at this point at some
point when you're developing your game
on
where you're gonna get to the point that
polling integrations is hard because
you've customized it so much for your
game so whatever changes you make to
underlying engine systems when there's
when there's a fundamental change that
comes in from your middleware provider
it's pretty difficult to consume that
all the time and then you start being
selective okay well we'll take faith
this feature but we won't take this
feature and what you don't know right
out of the gate is if there's any
interdependent writing on it what's
gonna happen and then you find that out
usually the hard way later on so we
tried to stop doing that we do
cherry-pick on on occasion from our
particular code base that we have up to
and again I was pretty sure it was 3.7
or 38 I just can't remember the exact
version right but yeah we've made some
pretty pretty major changes and it's
been ongoing for a while for c IG of
course I only came on about two and a
half years ago from crime tech after
supporting them with their engine draw
provisions and as soon as they were done
getting the engine on my car and I
better get over there No
so one of the big fundamental changes
and Chris had mentioned it what's the
support for a 64-bit positioning right
now what's a lot of people I think maybe
misunderstand is that it wasn't an
entire conversion for the whole engine
the engine split up in a very
independent and you know not as much as
they should be but isolated modules
right and they do talk to each other of
course but things like physics things
like render things like AI what are the
purposes of changing the AI to 64-bit
well all the positioning that it will
use will be drastic for a bit but the
the AI module itself doesn't really care
you know so there was a lot of changes
to support this large world coordinates
and it's actually pretty crazy I haven't
written up on my wall the actual maximum
it's 18 zeros that we can support in
terms of in terms of space which is
crazy because especially for if that's a
floating-point limit or something yeah
that's exactly yeah and at that point
like I mean you you just can't have any
more time within the memory so it's
pretty weird for people that have you
know come over from Crytek that have
worked on just CryEngine normally
because and Chris had mentioned this
you're working on like a 4 - I mean
maximum 8 kilometres of level and
already at that scale I felt like that
was pretty big but when it's it's such a
you know for lack of a better word it
messes with your mind in the large world
coordinates because you'll be sitting
there working on something and then your
start to start to zoom out you're like
yeah and the job is going it really
messes with your sense of scale though
because it can be pretty confusing again
if you're looking at a planet like I
mean you're looking at thousands of
kilometres of area right so it can get
very easy to underestimate how large the
undertaking of just populating something
whatever area - not just exactly right
so that can that can really mess with
your mind but that's one of the bigger
bigger changes we made of course with
with the implementation of planets but
more just with the positioning of it
right so now I think in the the first
system that we're gonna do and just
right now and this is maybe quantum
travel speeds will change or so but it
takes about 45 minutes at our at our
jump or quantum jump speed to cross an
entire system so that's just one system
and if you want to think of the systems
as levels I guess in them in themselves
that's kind of how you would think about
it they're ready basically no loading
for you know 45 minutes of quantum
travel which is the actual realistic
value of you know 0.2 C which is the 0.2
times the speed of light so it's crazy
how large that area is educated can
really mess your mind when you're
working on it yeah awesome
that's oh that he's gonna so the 64-bit
conversion I can I guess the the clarity
to be made is that it's not the entire
engine that's right will be the entire
right right so yeah that was the big
piece of clarity I think I and a lot of
people have this understanding they just
III think it's just easier done so yeah
they converted the engine sixty right
well okay the you know there was stuff
within the engine that were already was
64-bit what we really needed was physics
and positioning to be right and that's
what got changed so and to put that into
perspective for folks the world space
coordinates is one of the big impacts
from that you've got more space you can
work with is there anything else
specifically that you benefit from by
making the conversion to 64-bit yeah not
that I can think of right out of the
gate no it's more just supporting the
actual server itself more than anything
it's not better performance or anything
if anything it's a bit worse but I mean
we're talking marginal different rest
like I mean yeah if anything it said
it's actually tiny bit slower but with
newer CPUs actually we did we did make a
change to how that the positioning works
so actually it ends up being faster but
so normally if you're just gonna switch
over to seach for bit positioning you
would be a little bit slower in your
math so the other the only benefits we
get is just just the sheer amount of
space right and support for the players
and they have to have that amount of
space for a game that's young in space
right exams for procedural generation in
tech for the planets so procedural
generation written 2.0 mmm it's kind of
a big topic yeah right there's there's a
lot we can talk about here technically
we were talking with Chris as I said
there's another video on that so there's
biomes there's different I guess layers
you got called for the biomes so oh and
sort of interrupt you one of the things
that we had done
and I the difference between the v1 and
the beaten planets and because I was
sitting into the interview with Chris it
wasn't super clear what the difference
really was so on the v1 planet it was
our very first implementation what you
saw on our demos is actually just a
single terrain layer like it's one
material right um
yes okay we've got different textures
that are that are that are blending at
different distances and so but all the
planets that we had shown literally only
had a single material across the entire
planet which is pretty fake I mean
that's that's another oh and that's
actually in a lot of cases where you see
procedural generation tech it never goes
beyond that um they're happy with just
this one sort of rocky material or
whatever it happens to be across the
entire planet so what this does is it
brings us way more in line with how we
were making crisis levels or levels down
at Crytek with terrain because we always
had access or designers always ever
artists always had access to up to 16
layers for different terrain textures so
what we want to do with it is kind of
give them back that same ability just on
a ridiculous scale because again you
would you know and I thought it was a
lot of time to tell paint eight
kilometers of space and just paint you
know again like thousands of thousands
right crazy but yeah we want to give
them that amount of layers because
that's the only way that you're gonna
get the quality that you want out of a
first-person shooter or anything like
that you're never gonna get that with
just a single to sort of terrain layer
so another big improvement on the v2
planets is the biomes of course so on
the v1 v1 planets they had no bottoms
there was no idea whatsoever it's a
single terrain layer it's got the height
map great but on V - we've got biomes so
the biomes themselves have layers within
them for object placement for weather
like Chris note noted as well as the
vegetation and other objects like grass
actually adding foliage now exactly and
then and and this this was one of the
good reasons about coming from CryEngine
anyways we've reused and try to be used
as much as possible a lot of the really
powerful tools that CryEngine Artic had
for these things just at the bigger
scale right so again in the thinking of
the terrain layers well terrain layers
were the same way and crying - before
that let's just apply that to planet and
you've got the same sort of ability just
work on a larger scale same thing with
the vegetation I had noticed in that the
conversation with Chris of those more
advanced rule sets for vegetation so in
crisis to give you kind of some some
history we really only had like 16
different palm trees and like it did
pretty well for entire force and people
were like very low that vegetation to me
well what was really good about it was
the system that we use to place these so
we had variable scale we would set rule
sets on like a little layer or a group
for these vegetation objects so again
we'll take this really powerful tool and
apply it to the procedural stuff so
you'll do things like density okay how
how close can other you know palm trees
be to this are they randomly rotated
because that's that's a really easy win
for a lot of things so you might have
like this tree that's sort of rotated
like this right and if that's placed the
same rotation everywhere you're like say
NASA right but as soon as you randomly
rotate it a lot of people will be like
wow this is actually the Statue then
it's all actually the same asset though
right then you got randomized scale
that'll happen between them the density
random scale and whether it aligns to
height maps so like if the tree ends up
on the side of a hill does it go like
this or does it go like though the grass
it's about to do that but if it's a tree
it's gotta go yeah so there's a lot of
things we learned in in the crisis
projects and just working on CryEngine
generally that I think we're applying to
that tool set there so that it's just as
powerful because a mentality at Crytek
was always used the tools to get you 90%
of the way there and then let the
artists come in and do that last 10
percent right so that's the exact same I
deal with these planets we've got to
have powerful tools because again you've
got you know have a thousand planets or
whatever it's going to end up being how
to make all of those you know it in at
to a fidelity that
you know is we're all proud of right but
it doesn't take you know not take 10
years or 11 years to do it so so again
taking a lot of the tools from from
CryEngine is is really one of the best
things so a lot of people say oh yeah
well crazy idea to go with crime well
not really because there was a lot of
stuff in the engine that is very very
powerful because basically your own
engine now anyway like exactly so
exactly but it would be a shame to you
know just take all the old modules
delete you know there's no reason to do
that we know we want to try to save our
time and it build off of of good tool
sets that were already there right so
with the procedural generation stuff
like we said multiple layers we're
talking about with Chris about how you
might have a forest layer your biome
rather nexu some other neighboring
biomes swamps something like that yeah
what what sort of parameters are in when
the system is looking at how to blend
these multiple biomes supply yes the
edge blending and that's actually
something we're talking a lot about
right now even just last week we had a
pretty large Eno that we were going back
and forth on some things so so whatever
I answer right now guarantee this is
gonna take so I mean the the thinking
general use right now just like Chris
said there's a distribution map right so
you can either use that to inform all
your placement but then you don't really
get perfected plans what you can do is
on those edges of the of the clip Maps
because you kind of learn not to Club
pass the distribution map you know where
that ends so you can actually do a
certain distance that you're kind of
calling a blend distance or whatever so
this is where one is blending into the
other the problem is is if you have a
lot of biomes the rules to blend those
two are probably gonna end up being
pretty different for terrain layer
blending it's pretty straightforward we
did that in the crisis games that's a
sort of a high-pass technique of you
know kind of we have a detailed map
that's grayscale and then we have a low
detail that's more color and it's just
really easy to blend to greyscale
details together on top of you know just
a base color so terrain layer is
probably going to be easy it
see it's the vegetation and and like the
actual assets themselves because again
if you're blending from desert to jungle
yeah this kind of easy you know just a
little bit of grass at the edges and
then you spread in trees but when you
start doing like like a mountain sort of
forest versus jungle of versus city like
what do you do so a lot of rules again
is based on that based on that
distribution map we're gonna have a
distance and then that distance is gonna
be variable based on whatever biome is
blender do it so right now we're trying
to make it so that the rules are robust
enough that we get the nice blends out
of it but not so complex that nobody
will understand what's going on right
right
and that's again in the end we have to
give the artists and and the environment
designers some ability to go in and
manually fix whatever that is but we've
got to be able to get it 90% of the way
there you know with rules and really I
don't fix it on then so yeah I realized
it you can go into super deep detail
about that but it's kind of because yeah
yeah we're still talking about exactly
the right way to do it but what you'll
see in the in the citizencon demo for
the v2 planets already has a lot of that
blending in it just not in terms of
large objects right like that so as
always more information we'll have an
article below with kind of key talking
points things like that and I guess we
might be seeing you guys at citizencon
otherwise we'll have coverage of it
online separately so awesome tune in for
that thank you for joining me Sean
you're very welcome what's fun yeah
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
