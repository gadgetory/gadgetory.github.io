interview with technical director Sean
Tracy from cloud imperium games even if
you're not interested in star citizen
right now the interviews should be
pretty interesting because it contains
information about 64-bit coordinates and
world space and what is a 64-bit engine
we talk about meshes and textures and
mapping all the stuff load processing
and management before getting to this
coverage it is brought to you by antec
and their new mini ITX cube case
designed by razor it's got an aluminum
shell acrylic windows on the side and it
should be available shortly so just as
an FYI part two of this interview will
go up on Wednesday and that will include
the character technology that's been
updated for citizen Khan and also load
management on the cpu threading pins
like that so without further ado I will
let you get to part one of the interview
hey everyone we're here at the cloud
imperium games offices near santa monica
and la i guess i don't really know where
we already are i'm joined by it Sean
Tracy from CI g and we just talked with
chris Roberts of course so that video
will be on the channel now we're going
to be going more technical so the first
kind of question bring up in our
interview with Chris he mentioned the
concept of I use the word CryEngine yeah
which kind of response was not really
crying anymore yeah right so the working
title we had then was star engines so
yeah so storage has been kind of bounced
around I don't know how how absolutely
official it is or anything like that but
yeah I mean it's a pretty different
version than what the CryEngine is we
branched quite a while ago so we haven't
taken a new CryEngine version for quite
some time it's about the 3.7 3.8 area of
CryEngine so this was this was early
last year might have been before that
were we branched off so we branched off
entirely because it was getting really
difficult to take the integrations at
this point at some point when you're
developing your game on
where you're going to get to the point
that polling integrations is hard
because you've customized it so much for
your game so whatever changes you make
to underlying engine systems when
there's when there's a fundamental
change that comes in from your
middleware provider it's pretty
difficult to consume that all the time
and then you start being selective okay
well we'll we'll take faith this feature
but we won't take this feature and what
you don't know right out of the gate is
if there's any interdependent on it
what's going to happen and then you find
that out usually the hard way later on
so we tried to stop doing that we do
cherry pick on on occasion from our
particular code base that we have up to
and again I was pretty sure with 3.7 or
318 I just can't remember the exact
version right but yeah we've made some
pretty pretty major changes and it's
been ongoing for a while for CI g of
course I only came on about two and a
half years ago from crime tech after
supporting them with their engine drama
revisions and as soon as they were done
getting the engine on my car and I
better get over there No so one of the
big fundamental changes and Chris had
mentioned it was the support for a
64-bit positioning right now what's a
lot of people i think maybe
misunderstand is that it wasn't an
entire conversion for the whole engine
um the engine split up in a very
independent and you know not as much as
they should be but isolated modules
right and they do talk to each other of
course but things like physics things
like render things like AI what are the
purposes of changing the AI to 64-bit
well all the positioning that it will
use will be dressing for a bit but the
day I module itself doesn't really care
you know so there was a lot of changes
to support this large world coordinates
and it's actually pretty crazy I haven't
on my wall the actual maximum it's 18
zeros that we can support in terms of in
terms of space which is crazy because
especially for is that's a floating
point limit or something yeah that's
exactly yeah and at that point like I
mean you just can't have any more time
within the memory so it's pretty weird
for people that have you know come over
from Crytek that have worked on just
CryEngine normally because and Chris had
mentioned this you're working on like a
42 I mean maximum eight kilometers of
level and already at that scale I felt
like that was pretty big but when it's
such a you know for lack of a better
word it messes with your mind in the
large world coordinates because you'll
be sitting there working on something
and then you're so to start to zoom out
in your life sort of searches a bit more
and the job is going it really messes
with your sense of scale though because
it can be pretty confusing again if
you're looking at a planet like I mean
you're looking at thousands of
kilometers of area right um so can get
very easy to underestimate how large the
undertaking of just populating something
by area to not just exactly right so
that can that can really mess with your
mind but that's one of the bigger bigger
changes made of course with with the
implementation of planets but more just
with the positioning of it right so now
I think in the the first system that
we're going to do and just right now and
this is maybe quantum travel speeds will
change or so but it takes about 45
minutes at are at our jumper quantum
jump speed to cross an entire system so
that's just one system and if you want
to think of the systems as levels i
guess in them in themselves that's kind
of how you would think about it they're
ready basically no loading for you know
45 minutes of quantum travel which is
the actual realistic value of you know
zero point to see which is the 0.2 times
the speed of license it's crazy how
large that area is educated can really
mess your mind when you're working on it
yeah awesome
that so that is kind of cool so the
64-bit conversion I can I guess the the
clarity to be made is that it's not the
entire engine that's right got some time
you will be the entire right right um so
yeah that was the big piece of clarity I
think a lot of people have this
understanding they just I I think it's
just easier done so yeah they converted
the engine 60 right well okay you know
there was stuff within the engine that
will already was 64 bit what we really
needed was physics and positioning to be
right and that's what got changed so and
to put that into perspective for folks
the world space coordinates is one of
the big impacts from that you've got
more space you can work with is there
anything else specifically that you
benefit from by making the conversion
ought to 64-bit yeah not that I can
think of right out of the gate it no
it's more just supporting the actual
threat itself more than anything it's
not better performance or anything if
anything it's a bit worse um but I mean
we're talking marginal different rest
like I mean it yeah if anything it said
it's actually tiny bit slower but with
newer CPUs actually we did we did make a
change now that the positioning work
zone actually it ends up being faster
Punta normally if you're just going to
switch over to seach for bit positioning
you would be a little bit slower in your
math so the other the only benefits we
get is just just the sheer amount of
space right and support for the players
and they have to have that amount of
space for a game that's young in space
wreck exam for procedural generation
intact of the planets so procedural
generation written two point oh it's
kind of a big topic yeah right there's
there's a lot we can talk about here at
eric lee we were talking with Chris as I
said there's another video on that so
there's biomes there's different I guess
layers you got called for the biomes so
oh and sort of interrupt you one of the
things that we had done
and I the difference between the V one
of the few planets and because i was
sitting in to the interview with chris
or it wasn't super clear what the
difference really was so on the v1
planning it was our very first
implementation um what you saw on our
demos is actually just a single terrain
layer like it's one material right um
yes okay we've got different textures
that are debtor that are blending at
different distances and so but all the
planets that we had shown literally only
had a single material across the entire
planet which is pretty fake I mean
that's that's another oh and that's
actually in a lot of cases where you see
procedural generation tech it never goes
beyond that um they're happy with just
this one sort of rocky material whatever
it happens to be across the entire
planet so what this does is it brings us
way more in line with how we were making
crisis levels or levels down at Crytek
with terrain because we always had
access or designers always our artists
always had access to up to 16 layers for
different terrain textures so what we
want to do with it is kind of give them
back that same ability just on a
ridiculous scale because again you would
you know and I thought it was a lot of
time to paint eight kilometers of space
and just paint you know again like
thousands of thousands times crazy but
yeah we want to give them that amount of
layers because that's the only way that
you're gonna get the quality that you
want out of a first-person shooter or
anything like that you're never going to
get that with just a single to sort of
train there so another big improvement
on the v2 planets is the biomes of
course so on the v1's but v1 planets
they had no bottoms there was no idea
whatsoever it's a single terrain layer
it's got the height map great but on v2
we've got biomes so the biomes
themselves have layers within them for
object placement for weather like Chris
note noted as well as the vegetation and
other objects like Chris actually adding
foliage now and things okay exactly and
then
and this this was one of the good
reasons about coming from CryEngine
anyways we reuse and try to reuse as
much as possible a lot of the really
powerful tools that CryEngine already
had for these things just at the bigger
scale right so again in the thinking of
the terrain layers while terrain layers
were the same way and crying too before
that let's just apply that to planet and
you've got the same sort of ability to
just work on a larger scale same thing
with the vegetation I had noticed in
that in conversation with Chris of those
more advanced rule sets for vegetation
so in crisis to give you kind of some
some history we really only had like 16
different palm trees and like it did
pretty well for entire force and people
were like very low that vegetation
zamane well what was really good about
it was the system that we use to place
these so we had a variable scale we
would set rule sets on like a little
layer or a group for these vegetation
objects so again we'll take this really
powerful tool and apply it to the
procedural stuff so you'll do things
like density okay how how close can
other you know palm trees be to this are
they randomly rotated because that's
that's a really easy win for a lot of
things so you might have like this tree
that's sort of rotated like this right
and if that's placed the same rotation
every where you're like say NASA right
but as soon as you randomly rotate it a
lot of people will be like wow this is
actually the statue then it's all
actually the same asset though right um
then you got randomized scale that will
happen between them the density random
scale and whether it aligns to hide maps
so like if the tree ends up on the side
of a hill does it go like this or does
it go like there's a grass it's got to
do that but if it's a tree it's got to
go yeah so there's a lot of things we
learned in in the crisis projects and
just working on CryEngine generally that
I think we're applying to that toolset
there so that it's just as powerful
because a mentality at Crytek was always
used the tools to get you ninety percent
of the way there and then let the
artists come in and do that last ten
percent right so that's the exact same I
deal with these planets we've got to
have powerful tools because again you
got you know a thousand planets or
whatever it's going to end up being how
to make all of those you know it in to
fidelity that
you know is it we're all proud of right
but it doesn't take you not take 10
years or 11 years to do it so so again
taking a lot of the tools from from
CryEngine is is really one of the best
things so a lot of people say oh yeah
well crazy idea to go with crimes well
not really because there was a lot of
stuff in the engine that is very very
powerful so I'm which was basically your
own engine now anyway like exactly so
exactly but it would be a shame to you
know just take all the old modules
delete you know there's no reason to do
that we know we want to try to save our
time and it build off of good tool sets
I were already there right so with the
procedural generation stuff like we said
multiple layers we're talking about with
Chris about how you might have a forest
layer younger biome rather not give you
some other neighboring biomes swamp
something like that yeah what what sort
of parameters are in when the system is
looking at how to blend these multiple
biomes but yes edge funding and that's
actually something we're talking a lot
about right now even just last week we
had a pretty large email that we were
going back and forth on some things so
so whatever I answer right now can
change or T this is gonna take so I mean
the the thinking generally is right now
I'm just like Chris said there's a
distribution map right so you can either
use that to inform all your placement
but then you don't really get perfected
plans what you can do is on those edges
of the of the clip maps because you kind
of learn not to club as the distribution
map you know where that ends so you can
actually do a certain distance that
you're kind of calling a blend distance
or whatever so this is where one is
blending into the other the problem is
is if you have a lot of biomes the rules
to blend those two are probably going to
end up being pretty different um for
drain layer blending it's pretty
straightforward we did that in the
crisis games that's a sort of a
high-pass technique of you know kind of
we have a detailed map that's gray scale
then we have a low detail that's more
color and it's just really easy to blend
to greyscale details together on top of
you know just a base color so terrain
layer is probably going to be easy
it's the it's the vegetation and like
the actual assets themselves because
again if you're blending from desert to
jungle yeah just kind of you know just a
little bit of grass at the edges and
then you spreading trees but when you
start doing like like a mountain sort of
forest vs jungle of versus city like
what do you do so a lot of the rules
again is based on that based on that
distribution map we're gonna have a
distance and then that distance is going
to be variable based on whatever biome
is blend to it so right now we're trying
to make it so that the rules are robust
enough that we get the nice blends out
of it but not so complex that nobody
will understand what's going on right
right and that's again in the end we
have to give the artists and and the
environment designers some ability to go
in and manually fix whatever that is but
we've got to be able to get it ninety
percent of the way there you know with
rules and really fix it on then so yeah
I realized it going to super deep detail
about that but it's kind of because yeah
we're still talking about exactly the
right way to do it but what you'll see
in the in the citizen Khan demo for the
v2 planets already has a lot of that
blending in it just not in terms of
large object rights like that so as
always more information will have an
article below it kind of key talking
points things like that and I guess we
might be seeing you guys at citizen khan
otherwise we'll have coverage of it
online separately so awesome tune in for
that thank you for joining me Sean
you're very welcome this one yeah we'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
