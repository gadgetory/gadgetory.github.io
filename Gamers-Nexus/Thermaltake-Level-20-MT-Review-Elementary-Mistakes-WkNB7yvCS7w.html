tapes level 20 cases before at least
officially specifically the small
form-factor at level 20 VT the level 20
MT is a mid tower in the same style
pairing rounded silver edges with flat
tempered glass panels where specifically
reviewing the level 20 MTA RGB which
comes with three 120 millimeter a RGB
intake fans at the front and one non RGB
fan at the back before that this video
is brought to you by the MSI r-tx 2070
gaming Z video card which is a dual
axial cooler and large fans reduced
noise had to give an hour p.m. each
running double ball bearings these sit
atop a multi slot aluminum heatsink to
create a two point eight slot card the
gaming Z spins down fans to zero rpm
went under low loads keeping the focus
on reducing noise whenever possible
custom RGB LED lighting is possible
through MSI software with an RGB
spectrum configured out of the box
click the link below to learn more this
is the case this is the one that's one
of the - that's sneaking and at the end
of the year after our best cases awards
show but that's ok because it doesn't
end up in the awards list anyway it's
not the worst case we've looked at but
it does have some flaws and first of all
to give you some perspective on where it
stands in the market it's about $90
maybe a hundred but 90s about where
we've been told to expect it to fall and
in the level twenty series it is a
follow up to the original level twenty
that we showed at Computex a couple
years ago at this point and that case
had something like 500,000 plus dollars
invested into tooling so it was a really
expensive series and that followed one
of the original Thermaltake designs
where they partnered with BMW design
works to work on a case so level 20 has
a very specific premiere branding stuck
to it and then they'll take brought that
brand down to the lower two your cases
its traditional halo marketing effect as
you might call it so this is one of
those more affordable ones at about 90
bucks and right away you can see a few
of the features on it that may be
jumping out to you if you follow our
channel one of which is the really thin
sliver here for airflow there's
glass panel the front Center small gaps
on either side now we've seen this
design work but it does take some
specific design elements to make it work
and one of those is typically higher
static pressure fans another one is a
bit of a gap between the fan and the
glass so they have enough space to try
and leverage that higher static pressure
assuming that is the higher static
pressure fan in the case in question and
for this one we'll talk about that in
the thermal section if it can manage to
make this design work but there are
still some basic flaws with it because
even if this were enough of a gap to
breathe and you'll see if it isn't in a
bit the filtration for it is decorative
so there's a dust filter off to the side
and we'll talk about this in Patrick's
filled notes as well where it's actually
not in front of any air intake it's not
in front of the fans it's next to them
and not much air it's gonna go through
there in fact most the air will go
through the fans but there is no dust
filtration in front of the fans and so
all the dust is going to go into the
case it's bit of an odd design choice
because really what should happen is
assuming you want a panel designed
exactly like this should probably have
the mesh here between the glass and this
curved beam on the side right in the
middle there so that it's actually in
front of where your air is coming in
because that's where the dust will come
in so kind of odd design decision the
glass we'd like to see boosted a bit
more away from the fans you'll see why
later and as for the rest so it is three
fans in the front pretty standard layout
but you could if you wanted to change it
around and we do this in our thermal
section for you so you can see what the
difference is there's an intake here or
exhaust if you prefer but intake makes
the most sense you'd set up with the
radiator or just with the fans that are
in the case so we rotated two of these
over to this side as intake and that one
actually does have a dust filter right
in front of the fans where it makes
sense on the steel side panel it's kind
of reversed
it's like a weird bizarro where else
where the side makes more sense for
intake and we've seen this before we saw
it with the leon leo 11 dynamic and when
done right like in that well evan
dynamics actually works extremely well
the
references that the 11 dynamics
completely obstructs the front panel it
doesn't even have these small gaps that
this one does so all that's doing is
taking your fans you know really having
the front moving to the side and I mean
the air will hit the side panel and then
bounce off of it and go somewhere else
so same idea as any other cooling system
really it's just less direct but if you
want to you can move over here and we'll
do that in a bit top does have a dust
filter so it's just the front that
they've missed out on it which is so
strange because typically if you were to
leave the case in this setup for the
most part this is a positive pressure
setup and a lot of your air will exhaust
out the top depending on the CPU cooler
you have sort of put a dust filter up
there but not on the front just seems
kind of backwards now this can be useful
because there is a rear exhaust fan and
that fan does pull air through the top
too because there's a big hole in the
top right next to it so kind of makes
sense but it's just it's an odd decision
to skip on the front filter and not the
top filter there's filters everywhere
else too you can keep making the point
with the bottom but I don't really need
to as for the inside of the case so
these are not captive screws but not a
big deal really oh it's at this price
point kind of expected so it kind of
slides out like that
not really genuinely hinged it's just
that the case has these metal lips so
the steel is stamped in a way that you
get this overhang on the top and you get
an overhang on the bottom and then the
panel slots in between those the only
reason for this to be there is if
Thermaltake thought it looks worse for
example for that glass to be exposed
rather than having a piece of steel
flush with the other pieces of steel so
whether or not that's good is really
entirely aesthetic and you can decide if
you like that steel up or not it is
pretty minor feature though but the
panel comes out without much issue it's
not it not fancy in any way but ninety
bucks doesn't need to be inside we have
a power supply shroud pretty standard at
this point it does have perforation on
the top which is something we generally
like to see and it's got a cutout here
on the side for your power supply logo
and branding if that's the thing you're
into on top of the power supply shroud
there is a two and a half inch mount and
then next
that there's radiator gap for installing
a large radiator and for the rest of
this let's go through Patrick's build
notes talk through the rest of the case
internally will go through thermals as
well the front panel is restrictive with
tiny one centimeter strips of mesh on
either side of the glass section
deceptively these strips aren't in the
path of airflow and don't act as filters
there isn't any filtration at all in the
front fans which instead pull air
through the narrow gaps behind the edges
of the front glass panel there's also a
wider gap hidden at the bottom of the
front panel typical for cases with
sealed designs like this one the rest of
the level twenty mt it seems to be an
attempt to make up for that closed off
front there are cutouts big enough for
two fans on the steel right side panel
of the case so that extra intake fans or
radiator could be installed as long as
the graphics card isn't too big this
intake is filtered unlike the front
panel there are also fan mounts along
the top of the power supply shroud which
is definitely a desirable feature and
should allow for much better GPU cooling
except a bottom to top airflow pattern
is generally encouraged by a vent at the
top of the case it's just that the
bottom of this case is almost entirely
sealed and any fans mounted here will
have to pull air from the front panel
instead there's almost no room at all
for cabling either we're used to
removing unused hard drive bays as a
matter of convenience but in this case
it was a matter of necessity it's hard
to imagine where cables could possibly
go with two hard drives installed under
the shroud there's already very little
clearance between the side panel and the
chassis and since part of the case is
taken up with the vents that's even less
area available for them to exist this
also makes it difficult to get the steel
side panel in place since it's the
old-fashioned kind with a steel lip at
the front and tabs along the top and
bottom that don't want to slide in if
the panel is even slightly bowed out the
faring controller is the biggest
sticking point with this case for a
couple of reasons for one it partially
blocks the cable cutout that we would
have otherwise used for the 24 pin power
cable that can be solved by unscrewing
the controller and reinstalling it once
the cable is through but it's
frustrating to have it in the way at all
it also has the same weakness that the
Lian Li of 550 ex control
in that it uses special 5 pin connectors
for combined fan and RGB signals so that
the fans can't be plugged into standard
headers or the motherboard these
connectors that do cut down on cable
clutter but at a cost unlikely and Lee's
controller
there's no PWM cable so there's no way
whatsoever to control the speed of the
three front fans other than soldering
together an adapter there are cables for
external RGB control and some credit is
due here there are adapters for Asus MSI
and gigabyte pin outs so the a RGB
aspect should work well the rear exhaust
fan is non RGB and just uses a standard
three-pin plug which means that it can't
be connected to the controller and set
to the same speed as the other fans
normally that might be a negative but
the other problems mentioned with the
controller cancel it out the lack of fan
speed control is a big oversight
especially for anyone hoping to install
a radiator behind these fans because the
single locked rpm is generally low a 360
millimeter radiator can indeed be
wrangled into place at the front of the
case as long as it can fit the gap in
the power supply shroud it would also
have to be installed tubes up to fit in
general which we don't recommend for
long-term use with closed loop liquid
coolers almost everything mentioned so
far in this review is negative so it's
worth taking a moment to clarify that we
don't hate this case the look the build
quality and the ease of installation are
fine but unremarkable it's in an
unfortunate position where the features
of the case that stick out happen to be
the flaws let's get into thermals we've
made testing cases without their front
panel part of the standardized test
suite now so that we can have an
understanding of how much those panels
are bottleneck in performance other than
that the only additional test we perform
this time was to move the upper and
lower intake fans into the side intake
vent on the side panel this actually
caused some air to exit through the
front panel which doesn't hurt
performance in a huge way but is a waste
of air that should instead be flowing
backwards through the case realistically
the options were improving airflow are
limited it's nice that Thermaltake has
included so many fans but it makes it
less likely that customers will want to
add additional ones so we only use the
stock fans for testing we could emulate
Lian Lee's or 11 dynamic by completely
sealing off the front panel and putting
two fans on the side intake but then we
wouldn't be showing
any of the ra RGB features through the
front panel which is sort of the selling
point of the case so there's a point of
realism that we have to abide by even
moving to to the side intake and leaving
the one in the front is pushing the
boundaries of what a user realistically
would do at least from an appearance
standpoint but it gives us some
important insight to how the case
performs we could leave the three led
intake fans in place to keep air from
leaking out of the front and install
fans on the side intake but at that
point there would be six case fans
running just to get an acceptable amount
of air moving at which point you have
enough money in those fans just buy
something else before looking at
comparative data we'll look just at the
level twenty mt against itself CB a
temperature in the torture test was 58
degrees celsius over ambient for the
stock configuration but dropped
significantly by about eleven degrees by
removing the front panel we'd like to
see this closer to the six to seven
degree Delta mark it's natural that a
front panel will inhibit cooling but
there are reasonable levels of that
inhibition
despite the air escaping from the front
moving the two fans to the side intake
lowered temperature by roughly four
degrees down to fifty four point one
over ambient removing the front panel
completely was a more significant
improvement down to 47 degrees the side
vent can be used to mitigate limitations
of the front panel while still enabling
that argb front look though 58 degrees
over ambience is relatively warm for the
CPU and compared to the rest of the
cases on our chart it's not yet in
runway thermal territory but it's pretty
high up there it's on the level of the
dark base pro 900 version one similar to
the stock defined C and defined s 2
which is unremarkable and a bit better
than the Alpha 550 and in win 303
compared to a previous thermal take case
it does worse than the view 71
regardless of whether or not the intake
fans are blocked the 120 millimeter
exhaust fan is decoupled from the fan
controller and therefore capable of
running its full 1400 RPM in the mt
which keeps temperatures from spiraling
out of control
moving on to GPU testing we saw a stock
TV a torture result of 59 degrees over
ambient scene benefit from a side intake
fans with a reduction to 56 degrees over
ambient as GPUs are heavily reliant upon
their thermal performance in terms of
the clocks every few degrees
to higher clock rate removing the front
panel caused an even bigger drop in
temperature on the GPU than it did on
the CPU down to forty six point five
degrees over ambient
the stock configuration it seems likely
that the intake fans are biased slightly
towards the GPU since the largest
available Inlet for air is at the bottom
of the front panel but the rear exhaust
fan primarily benefits the CPU any
benefit to the GPU is by way of removing
radiative heat off the backplate which
won't really affect the GPU core
temperature all that much here's a
comparative chart GPU temperatures
aren't the hottest we've ever recorded
but they are nearly the warmest among
the sampling of cases on our chart the
BitFenix Enzo and Walmart cases chart
higher for what it's worth but 59
degrees is about as hot as our GPU can
get before throttling itself to keep
cool nearby contenders would include the
Lian Li 11 air which functionally
requires removal of the dust filter to
actually allow airflow another nearby
item is the in--when 805 infinity one of
the worst performing cases on our charts
as it has literally zero front airflow
this isn't great positioning for the MT
going to side intake reduces thermals to
a point of competing with a defined r6
and the original H 500 P so not great
but at least it didn't advertise as
being high airflow 3dmark raised
temperatures slightly higher than the
torture testing did it equals the
BitFenix n so in this test which is an
unpleasant place to be the perforations
at the top of the power supply shroud
might help a little bit to alleviate
thermal concentration but our power
supply shroud was crammed full of cables
and a hard drive cage that blocked air
coming in from the lowest intake been
yours likely will be too because this is
with a modular power supply but under
CPU rendering with an average CPU
temperature of 38 point seven degrees
over ambient is a bit more reasonable
without the additional stress of the
torture workload and with relatively
little heat being generated by the GPU
the CPU torture fits comfortably into
the middle of the chart between the NZXT
age 500 and silverstone KL 0 7 GP
rendering averaged 29 point nine degrees
celsius over ambient also a better
temperature relative to other stock
cases than was indicated by the torture
test the stock configuration isn't too
bad
for the lighter workloads or the trickle
of air is still sufficient to drive heat
out of the case 39.4 DBA has our noise
result for the noise chart we have on
the screen now and it's not excessively
loud but it is when you keep in mind
that every other stock case test is
performed with fans running at full
speed there's only one speed that the
three intake fans can run at and that
speed isn't ideal for either noise or
airflow just to reiterate a point that
was written earlier in this review
there's a lot of criticism here there's
a lot of kind of negative look at the
case we don't hate the case at 90 bucks
it's a sensible price especially for a
case that has three argb fans than a
fourth it's got four fans in it it's
just that unfortunately those fans don't
do a whole lot because of the panel
design and the static pressure and that
controller is really just just annoying
because you can't plug those fans into
really anything else this is a problem
we had with Leon Lee's controller as
well for the borer fans originally but
at least there's had a PWM table with it
so third we'll take make some odd
decisions here it's not a ripoff of a
case the price is completely fine it's
just some of the design elements are not
that great and if stuff that Thermaltake
could relatively easily improve on so
again you gap the front glass a bit if
you're listening thermal tape take that
front glass bit distance it from the
fans
it'll help significantly you could then
move the mesh between the glass and the
side over here it won't look as good but
really does it look that good anyway I
mean what Hugh what's the design goal I
guess look at the design goal and figure
out how to make basic features work
within the confines of that goal because
you can't in a case like this which is
90 bucks priced at the average computer
bill there you can't get away with
skipping on basic features like having
enough pressure to bring air into the
case and having dust filtration for dust
if it were something like the whatever
that Cougar case is called the conker
something like that you can get away
with not having dust
because the whole concept of the case is
that as exposed to dust but it's cool
and that makes up for you can't really
get away with that in a mid-tower like
this
so this is just it needs a larger air
gap it needs a filter oh the fans and
the fans could be controlled at all or
it didn't use some fancy five pin
adapter or it had an adapter from five
pin to three pin then a lot of this
would be completely fine actually the
rest of the case the build quality is
okay it's acceptable the inside is
reasonable to work with it's not the
worst it's a bit limited on cable space
but it's not terrible and it's just it's
it's weird it's popular to have LED fans
behind the tempered glass panel yes but
we've seen how that works in the past
and there are ways to make it work well
it's just they didn't use them here so
if the fans can't pull the air in why
are they there
the answer is decoration it's there
because RGB and because glass and that's
it and if that's what you want and you
like the way the rest of the case looks
cool but just make sure you get a good
cooler CLC or something you'll be able
to brute-force it or run higher fan
speeds for the internal components would
also make up for it it's just that there
there are a lot of places that
Thermaltake could have done much better
with this case it has the basics of an
overall acceptable design the pricing is
very competitive actually extremely
competitive especially with for fans
with three that have a RGB with glass
it's got everything that needs to
compete especially at $90 or $100 it's
just it's missing those two critical
things dust filtration and air and then
I'll take we think you can you can do it
you can make this design work we might
just do it for you I don't know it
depends on if we have time but needs a
bit of work and hopefully they get there
