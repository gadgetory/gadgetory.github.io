tonight we were at GDC 2015 this is day
two for us we have some videos on the
channel already I'm here talking with
Dan touch president and director of
n-space and we're talking about Sword
Coast legends which is a return to dnd
roots similar to baldur's gate or
icewind dale games things like that
players who like those games should pay
attention here can you give us a quick
quick elevator pitch of sword coast
legends and sure absolutely yeah we're
definitely classically inspired by the
great rpgs like neverwinter nights and a
nice windale in baldur's gate but we
offer a twist now we let people to play
as a dungeon master and I think that's
probably the coolest bit about what
we're doing so we're really excited
about that bit and we saw the DM and the
demo DM player interaction can you give
our viewers a bit of an overview of how
that works sure the DM controls
everything in real time he gains a
resource called threat and that allows
them to spend that threat on you know
changing encounters summoning monsters
promoting those monsters you know link
traps locking doors creating secret
rooms you name it customizing the whole
experience is the dm's role in Sword
Coast legends similar to a DM is role in
the actual tabletop game yeah absolutely
it's very similar in a lot of us a 10
space play D&amp;amp;D very regularly and a lot
of SAR dm's so it's really balanced the
whole threats imbalanced around ensuring
that the party has a great time and
receives a really good challenge without
it being a complete party white very
much a collaborative cooperative
experience and that brings us to the
threat level so when we saw the demo the
DM started with I think a hundred threat
and then as he planted objects in the
game it decreased does that increase
again yeah absolutely is interaction
with the party is how that increases so
if you know the party's doing well and
they're taking a lot of damage and
they're you know they're discovering
traps and there you know unlocking doors
they'll gain more threat to encourage
the DM to do more of that stuff but if
he just party wipes them in fact they'll
lose they'll lose threat and it'll
become a very fun very unenjoyable
experience for people quite quickly are
there any key elements to plan as a DM
that you really personally enjoy or have
liked developing yeah absolutely i mean
i do really enjoy rolling for the
monsters for me that's that's a really
exciting bit so having another level of
ability to sort of control
how their how they're behaving you know
take control of them engage in their
tactics promote them make them stronger
make them weaker all of that ability to
me is is is even better than it is on
the table top so for me that's a really
exciting bit and then telling story
telling stories always a the best part
of DD as well too so with stories in
traditional dnd kind of create a
campaign and go over it over a few
months or years or whatever can you do
that with story post legends absolutely
we're not talking a lot of details right
now but I can tell you that there is
campaign creation and DMS can create
campaigns that go on nearly forever if
they want very cool do we have a release
target or price yet I can tell you that
we're releasing this year and there's a
variety pricing options starting at 34
99 just go to Sword Coast legends calm
sort Coast comma should say and there we
go very cool so that is stored Coast
legends check the links in the
description below for more information
and we will see you all next time
