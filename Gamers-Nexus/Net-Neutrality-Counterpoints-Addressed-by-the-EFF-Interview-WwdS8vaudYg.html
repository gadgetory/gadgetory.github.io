from the e FF he is a senior
technologist and we're going to be
talking about net neutrality today so
the point of this discussion is rather
than do the that here's why net
neutrality is important here's why you
should care about it that's kind of been
done to death so I'm going to bring it
up some counter points that we've seen
on internet comments and from the FCC
and then Jeremy is going to be
addressing those with his own counter
points or clarification or things of
that nature so the idea is to bring both
viewpoints to the table for the argument
that way we can get a fuller
understanding of what's going on rather
than just an elevator pitch of net
neutrality but before we get into that
this coverage is brought to you by
ifixit.com and their protec toolkit I
fix it as refreshing there protec
toolkit in time for the holidays you can
find a link in the description below to
the protec toolkit and other toolkits
that iFixit sells we find the protec and
essentials kits to be the most useful
for DIY enthusiasts so Jeremy let's
start with the question of the net
neutrality did not exist before 2015 so
this one we've seen in comments a lot
where people say yeah net neutrality
wasn't even a thing until two years ago
so we have the same problems then as we
did now how does the repeal of net
neutrality hurt that or helped that or I
think you see where I'm going with this
one totally so for I guess I'd start by
saying that the the premise of the
question isn't 100% true so it is true
that we did not have official you know
written regulation enforcing net
neutrality until 2015 that's true but we
did have for basically ten years leading
up to that was the FCC saying that we
are going to try to enforce net
neutrality one way or another I mean it
started when they tried to take action
against Comcast for throttling
BitTorrent back in 2006 then they first
tried one set of rules
a court throughout saying you know you
can't do it under title 1 of the
Communications Act you have to
reclassify ISPs as common carriers and
that's of course what led to the 2015
order so so while it's true that you
know the the official you know rules
that have held in court didn't exist
until 2015 for 10 years we've had an FCC
that has said we are going to work to
enforce net neutrality we're just
figuring out how and the effect of that
is that it deterred a lot of bad
behavior that could have happened so
when you have an agency saying we're
working to enforce this we're figuring
out how to do it you know if I'm a
company I'm gonna say you know I'm not
you know I I wanted to throttle or block
some website but the FCC is determined
to find some way to enforce net
neutrality so I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna you know play that game and see
you know just how far I can get with
blocking or throttling before I get in
trouble and so that's why I don't think
it's quite right I mean a another
another difference is that not only has
the has this repeal I guess undone what
the 2015 order did in terms of you know
bright-line rules against blocking and
throttling this repeal has explicitly
said and the FCC has no authority over
internet providers in any way shape or
form no matter how bad their behavior is
so they've actually gone you know even
further backwards than where we were in
2015 with what they repeal which you
know from my perspective certainly is
unfortunate so I I don't think it's the
case that you know we did have net
neutrality before 2015 we had an agency
that was trying to enforce net
neutrality one way or another it you
know had misstep certainly so we do have
the same problems and more that we did
in 2015 now we've got the same problems
we had back in 2006 when Comcast got
away with traveling BitTorrent I'm just
saying to you know to anyone using
BitTorrent then go find a different
Internet service provider right so then
talking about the different agencies
that can contribute to governing or
overseen not
the idea as I understand it now is that
a lot of these obligations would be
handed off to the FTC if that's I think
that's kind of okay so that's kind of my
understanding of it so then the next
question is well can't we just trust the
FTC to do the same job or you know where
where's the disconnect there why can't
the FTC do the same job as the FCC so
the the reason we can't trust I mean the
reason relying on the FTC won't work is
the the FTC's only authority is to
regulate unfair and deceptive or at
least with respect to what you know the
types of things we want them to regulate
with respecting that neutrality is to
regulate unfair and deceptive trade
practices so what that means is that
your if your internet provider says in
their fine print oh and by the way we're
going to throttle you know all of these
websites and we're going to block your
access to these other websites then you
can't complain to the FTC because it's
not unfair or deceptive they told you
they were gonna do it they went ahead
and did what they said they were gonna
do and the FTC will just look at you and
say you know look it was in the fine
print what are you gonna I mean we can't
we can't enforce we can't take any
action against them they were
transparent and so that's why you know
this this argument that somehow the FTC
will be able to play the cop on the beat
and make sure that internet providers
are on their best behavior
it just it rings hollow all the FTC can
do is make sure that internet providers
don't go further than what they say
they're going to do and you can set the
internet providers I mean Comcast
already deleted its open Internet pledge
and so they're they're being transparent
they're being honest and the FTC can't
do anything about that so if you're the
FTC can make sure that the things they
do are the things that you know the bad
behavior we see is the bad behavior they
tell us they're gonna do which is cold
comfort I think yeah well yeah that's a
good way of putting it I think so with
if we take that same scenario of the
ISPs declare in the fine print
what it is they're doing and then we
just go back to where we have the FCC
overseeing it as opposed to the FTC
what's the difference there and how
those two agencies would react to what
you might consider unfair trade
practices so the I think the big
difference is that the FCC does have
authority to create regulations about
how internet providers can conduct their
business about in particular how they
can manage traffic on their networks so
the FTC doesn't have any statutory
authority to do that the FTC is not
allowed by law to put out the kinds of
you know no blocking no throttling rules
that we had up until a few days ago
whereas the FCC can and so that's the
you know the big reason why it makes a
lot more sense for the FCC to be the one
doing it because they can actually make
rules that prohibit the bad behavior we
don't want internet providers to take
part in right okay that makes sense
next question then this is another
account we saw on Twitter this one's
pretty common it's the idea that the
free market will decide so if you don't
like your ISP the free market will find
a way to correct it make that better and
give you the consumer better options so
what would be your response to that
so it's interesting so uh a little bit
of backstory here so as you mentioned
I'm I work for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation up until probably about three
years ago or so maybe it's four maybe
it's two and a half something like that
EF F was actually very much against
having the FCC put forward any sort of
regulations on internet providers and we
were very much of the of the opinion no
we should just let the free market take
care of this you know if Kalan Cass does
something terrible you can switch to a
different ISP and and you know get
better service the our eventual
realization though was that that's not
working I mean if you look at broadband
companies across the USA
I think the statistic is something like
half of Americans have at most it's it's
either at most one or two choices in
broadband so basically you get cable or
DSL and of course DSL is slow so nobody
really wants DSL so you basically and
they have one choice when it comes to
broadband and there is really not any
competition I mean these companies have
agreed not to build over each other's
service areas I mean they've got these
agreements that say you know Comcast
will not encroach on an area where
charter already has service and so
that's the reality I mean the reality is
simply that there is no free market
competition right now you can't choose
to use a different ISP you know and and
to be clear there are a few exceptions
to that if you live in a major
metropolitan area you might have a few
more choices you know San Francisco is
great we've got even some small is local
ISPs that are really good on net
neutrality but if you live in most of
the country you know a lot of suburban
areas and especially a lot of rural
areas where you may not even have cable
as a choice really only have DSL as a
choice or maybe even satellite which is
kind of scary you you don't there is no
competition and so there when there's no
competition the free market can't can't
help you now some people could say well
or at least an argument I've heard is
that that may be true now but if the
practices get really awful enough then
there will be demand and you know new
ISPs will come in I think the the issue
with that argument or the issue I have
is that starting a new ISP is
ridiculously expensive because
infrastructure is expensive you know
starting a software company is easy you
just find you know two people to write
some software and you're set starting an
ISP is a lot harder because it takes a
lot more than two people to dig all of
the trenches to lay all of the fiber to
make the connections to people's homes
to get the backhaul in that connects to
the local peering point you know all of
these things that are just it just costs
a lot of upfront capital to do and I
think that's the the real reason
mean part of it is you know that these
are giant you know corporations and it's
tough to compete against them but part
of it is even if you know that wasn't an
issue just starting an isp is is
ridiculously expensive and so it's hard
to imagine that you're going to get a
lot of people saying I've got the cash
to throw into this company and we'll see
if it works
and it's not gonna make you know we're
not talking you know an investment where
I'll get you know Google sized returns
you know ten years down the line or
something like that it's you know so
yeah well and speaking of Google -
they're having enough trouble on their
own starting up in ISP
yeah Google Fiber hasn't necessarily had
it easy so if a company the size of
Google is struggling to roll out I can't
imagine how difficult it would be for an
upstart I think I think that's a great
point I mean and and part of the reason
Google is struggled is because not only
do you have the you know the cost
prohibitions but you have you know these
companies you know Comcast and Verizon
and AT&amp;amp;T they have like huge lobbying
budget and they can lobby in state and
local governments to keep a new
competitor out and so that's part of it
too is that these corporations have have
just extensive political power
particularly at the state and local
level and so yeah I mean if Google can't
do it it's kind of hard to believe that
I mean there's lots of things that you
know I'm sure people can do that Google
couldn't pull off but it does indicate
that there is some difficulty there it's
not as easy as you might think right so
what what about the topic of this is
another internet comment the government
created these monopolies and dwelle
please in the first place so that's
that's when we've seen as well so I
think that's true to some extent I mean
when you think of you know giving
companies access to the right-of-way and
that sort of thing having you know
exclusive franchise agreements it's true
to some extent but that doesn't mean
that the right thing to do is to then
abdicate responsibility
for overseeing these government created
monopolies and dois police it's like
saying you know Frankenstein created
that you know his monster uh add that he
should just let it go wander in in you
know in the village and attack people
like that's know if if you created it
then you have a little bit of
responsibility to either undo the damage
you did and make you know alternatives
to the monster or you know rain in the
monster's behavior and so I mean I agree
to some extent but I think it's kind of
not it's it doesn't help with arguing
against why we shouldn't have some
bright-line net neutrality rules I've
got a couple quotes from the FCC as well
so these this one was published in The
Verge a couple months ago and I believe
it was ajik
that title two classifications quote
hurt low-income rural and urban
neighborhoods and said that the the
effect would be accelerated Digital
redlining and so that these
neighborhoods would be the first areas
where internet providers cut their
spending
ah that might be true with internet
providers we're cutting their spending
there were no indications that internet
providers were cutting their spending as
a result of the net neutrality order I
mean you you know you look at quotes
from from CEOs and CFOs from some of
these internet providers I mean in in
2016 the CEO of AT&amp;amp;T said that we're
investing aggressively in the network
architecture that is going to give us a
competitive advantage in cost and we
continue to invest in spectrum you had
the CEO of Time Warner Cable back in
2016 saying that you know once again we
invested heavily in our network and
equipment now network investments to
drive better reliability and greater
capacity the CFO of Verizon in 2016 said
we remain committed to consistently
investing in our network for the future
our 2015 investments have positioned us
for growth and allow us to maintain our
network leadership leader
position as we consistently as
consistently acknowledged by third
parties sorry about that so I mean I'd
be worried if it were true I certainly
don't want to see the practical
redlining but that's not what we were
seeing in reality you know a GP might be
living in a different reality than the
rest of us and and I feel sorry for him
if that's the case but it's not what we
were seeing we are seeing continued
investment no decrease in investment and
I actually think it's the flip I would
almost say it's the opposite because as
I mentioned you know low income
particularly rural neighborhoods rural
areas as I mentioned don't have a lot of
choice when it comes to their Internet
service provider and so if you end up
stuck with one that is going to throttle
your speeds to certain websites that you
want and only provide fast lanes to the
website you don't want or block access
to websites that you really want to get
access to you're out of luck right you I
mean that's you might as well again that
might that effectively the same as your
internet provider cutting access when
they cut back their spending because
they're not giving you access to what
you want to be able to access so I
really don't see how reducing people's
ability to control what they can access
is somehow gonna help you know
low-income rural and urban neighborhood
right I have another quote from the FCC
so this one was broadband providers will
have stronger incentives to build
networks especially an unserved areas
and to upgrade networks to gigabit
speeds and 5g this was a public
statement promoting the repeal of net
neutrality they further stated this
means there will be more competition
among broadband providers it also means
more ways that startups and tech giants
alike can deliver applications and
content to more users and then
concluding in short it's a freer and
more open Internet any response to that
one so that is what what I would call
doublespeak it
it's using words to say the opposite to
say the opposite of what they actually
mean I mean it's almost like straight
out in 1984 as I met so I guess the
first thing is again to to emphasize
that broadband providers already had
plenty of incentive to build networks
especially in unserved areas they were
not losing money because of net
neutrality they were certainly and I
will you know not mince words about this
unable or prevented from extracting
every last penny and really squeezing
money out of both their customers and
third parties you know the edge
providers the web sites the startups
where they you know prevented from
squeezing as much money as they could
from those from those two sides yes
that's true but there a fundamental
business model of I am going to take
your data and send it to where you want
me to send it to and vice versa
they were not struggling with that and
and so I think it's a little
disingenuous to say that suddenly that
somehow you know there is no evidence
that that they're going to you know
build networks and unserved areas you
know we can now if the if these if this
repeal stands you know we can wait and
see and we can test that theory
you know it will see in terms of more
competition among god broadband
providers again uh that's just not true
certainly among wired providers as as we
as I explained before it costs a lot of
money to build out a wired network and
so there's no reason to think that you
will be you'll see more competition from
new entrants and in terms of a freer and
more open Internet uh again you know I I
fail to see how an internet where if I
want to if I've got some cool new app
and I want to you know I want to
distribute it to the world I'm now gonna
have to go and potentially pay you know
a dozen different internet providers or
more and that's only you know that's
only if we're
about the big ones but if I have to go
pay a dozen different internet providers
to make sure that I don't get throttled
down to some you know minimal speed that
doesn't sound like a freer and more open
Internet for me if I have to pay to be
able to because good you know the
googles and Netflix is the the the
Microsoft's the you know Facebook's they
are all going to be able to pay the
internet providers for fast lanes now
that fast lanes are blessed by the FCC
the the companies that won't be able to
pay our small businesses and startups
and so if you want to compete if you've
got something that you think is you know
the next the next Facebook killer you're
gonna have to pay and you're gonna have
to figure out you're gonna have to work
into your budget not only do I have to
pay a bunch of smart engineers to build
this app I also have to pay all of these
big internet providers just so I can
reach people at the same speed as
Facebook or Google but I joined back to
what you were just saying about Facebook
and potential competition if there's a
lot of discussion of startups and new
companies might have to pay to get fair
access or distribution so in your eyes
or on the e FF size how likely a
scenario is that to actually happen you
know that what it is is this getting
blown out of proportion online or is
this like a an actual real immediate
concern so from my perspective actually
think this is the most likely outcome I
think that's the first thing that you're
gonna see once the rules actually I mean
so and I'm going to be clear the rules
haven't gone into effect yet because
they have to get published in the
Federal Register to become official
regulations and that could take months
but once that happens I think it's the
first thing I mean I think you're much
more likely to see internet providers
start offering fastlane services and
then of course you'll see the big
companies jump right in and pay because
they know that you know if I want
someone to use my product you know an
extra second or two of load time will
just kill the proportion of people that
use my prod
I think it's more you know it's the
first thing you'll see you'll see that
before you start seeing you know Comcast
or Verizon blocking specific websites
before you see them like offering
separate packages for social media or
for streaming video although to be
honest we're already seeing that to some
degree you know I think every single one
of the major mobile carriers now just by
default throttles streaming video and
just says that's that's what we do and
if you want HD video you have to pay us
more which is you know directly against
net neutrality right they also throttle
uploads too which we know from uploading
YouTube videos oh yeah exactly um you
know if it looks like video streaming it
gets throttled and so all right so I
think you'll see the order in which
you'll see things is you know fast lanes
immediately being offered immediately
being snapped up and immediately causing
trouble for small businesses and
startups that want to compete with more
entrenched players the second thing
you'll see is a lot more differentiation
of traffic on mobile networks you know
it even more so than we already do in
terms of streaming video and I think
you'll see both of those things first
and then the rest of it is gonna be more
subtle I think it will take a little
time before we see you know you have to
pay X and more dollars a month to if you
want to get Facebook or Twitter or that
sort of thing
I think that will take a little longer
because the ISPs are wary of the
backlash that would cause whereas the
other things either people aren't you
know can't be consciously aware of it's
not sort of in your face or you know
like with zero rating and throttling
video it's harder for people to notice
it right with the idea of fast lanes do
you see that being more of something
that is offered to the consumer or is
this more of like a business-to-business
fast lane this what I'm talking about is
more of a business-to-business fast lane
something where an ISP says to some edge
provider some website or some app hey if
you want to access our customer
pay us this much per month and we will
give you a faster connection or will
prioritize your traffic and then by
doing that people will use your system
your service more and you'll make more
revenue above and beyond what you have
to pay us which is probably true but it
stifles competition right yeah that's a
huge competitive advantage for anyone
who already is an incumbent in their
space so two more main ones here one is
about VPNs so for people who are
considering the option are already using
VPNs
to protect themselves do you foresee
these net neutrality changes impacting
those users I mean if I say well I have
a VPN so they they can't see what I'm
doing anyway yeah how does that come
back to me if net neutrality is repealed
ah they could start straddling VPN
traffic like if a particularly
pernicious internet provider has decided
you know I want to you know squeeze as
much money out of my customers as
possible
so if they want to be able to stream
video at more than at HD quality HD
speeds they're going to have to pay you
know an extra five dollars a month or
ten dollars a month and then I really
want to enforce that I can also start
throttling VPNs and say same thing if
you want to use a VPN you have to pay me
ten dollars a month
otherwise it's it's and they won't say
it's throttled they'll say you know it's
here is your normal speed and if you
want the higher speed you have to pay
more which is the same thing as saying
this is you know the higher speed is the
normal speed and you know what's
rattling you otherwise so it's I mean
fast lanes slow lanes and it's the fact
that there's a difference there that
really matters and so I think that might
take a little bit longer you know again
this is not something we're gonna see
overnight they're gonna you know do
trial balloons they'll they'll try
things in certain areas they'll start
trying practices maybe not announcing it
in some big splashy announcement but
only you know having it in their fine
print at first until people catch on you
know the the ISPs aren't dumb they're
going to be subtle about this so as to
avoid a backlash because a public
backlash
they know is disaster for them so
they're gonna be smart about how they do
it there they're clever right last major
question for you here is we have about
55 percent international viewers for our
YouTube channel so only maybe 45 percent
or so folks are in the u.s. eight
percent in Canada then you have all over
the world does any of this impact those
people who don't live in the US so I
think there is there's uh two ways I
would say that it potentially impacts
people not in the u.s. um
one I would say and and this is a
positive impact uh uh for people who
don't live in the US because it's kind
of a negative people impact for people
who do is that I can definitely see this
affecting where innovation online in
terms of you know what are the physical
hubs of activity in areas where this
sort of thing happens you know if I'm a
new startup and I want to be able to try
out you know my new app and I want to
you know get feedback maybe I won't
target the u.s. first as a market maybe
I'll target some other market that has
net neutrality first so I can work out
all the kinks and you know really in you
know establish myself as an awesome app
first before I have to go pay Comcast
and Verizon huge fees to access the
American market certainly you know my
goal will eventually be to get into the
American market but for testing and
really you know trying things out I
might not decide to start there and
that's unfortunate for Americans and
certainly a benefit for the rest of the
world uh so that gets a little bit of
unintended good news for for
international folks the the other thing
though that I would watch out for is
that a lot of times policy ideas get
exported from the US other countries see
that oh the US did this so why don't we
try it too I mean we've seen that with
copyright policy it's to disastrous
effect we've seen that with other
intellectual property you know patent
reform that sort or lack thereof that
sort of thing and so you know I would
worry that you know if a internet
provider in another country got enough
political power and and managed to
convince local politicians that hey the
the u.s. did this and we don't want to
fall behind so let's you know get rid of
our net neutrality rules too and so I
would keep I'd keep an eye out for that
I think it's entirely possible again
it'll take time this isn't gonna happen
overnight but it's something to keep an
eye out for you good answer there
finally uh so for anyone who wants to
get involved or maybe feel like you're a
little helpless or your voice doesn't
matter or anything like that
obviously the e FF the Electronic
Frontier Foundation is a great place to
that we've used for resources so how can
folks leverage the e FF or what else can
they do to get involved so if you're in
the u.s. the first and foremost thing
you can do is because these regulations
haven't taken effect yet so so some of
your viewers may remember back at the
beginning of 2017 Congress ended up
repealing a bunch of privacy rules that
the FCC had put out about internet
providers and what they could do with
your personal information it turns out
that Congress could use the same
procedural setup to undo this repeal of
net neutrality rules so if you go to act
F F dot org acte F s org and you scroll
down the very first thing you'll see is
protect the open Internet order and you
can basically it's a set up where you
punch on your phone number your address
we'll figure out who your Congress
people are and then you can contact them
both your your representative and your
Senators and say tell them how important
net neutrality is to you and that you
expect them to use what's called the
congressional review act the CRA to
overturn this repeal of net neutrality
and so if we if we have success with
that
then thankfully this discussion will
have been moot because the Senate will
have and and and Congress will have
