time on the PC and the Xbox now so this
is a comparison piece showing the
graphics differences between the Xbox 1x
version of Final Fantasy 15 and the PC
we also equalized the game settings
between the two to figure out where the
Xbox falls when compared to PC graphics
settings and tested the high resolution
texture pack to determine whether it's
actually worth about 60 to 70 gigabytes
of your space so for this video we're
looking at console versus PC maximum and
average graphics comparisons along with
some additional technical deep dives on
a few of the graphics elements in the
game before that this video is brought
to you by the new cable mod Pro Series
cable mods new pro cables come with
pre-installed closed combs for clean
builds accompanied by a revamp to color
style and vibrance the cables are now
using thicker wires and they've also
added right-angled internal USB 3
extension and right-angled SATA data
cables by the pro series cable kits at
the link below or customize it your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below we wrote this content into
a few pieces the first section talks
about graphics technology used in the
game subsurface scattering being one of
them PBR being another and again a very
short revisit of game work technologies
if you're curious to learn more about
those you can check our previous two
content pieces one of which was a follow
up benchmark to the playable demo which
remains true for the full game basically
we found that the original hair works
LOD scaling issues have been more or
less resolved at this point but other
than the graphics information we'll talk
about console there's P see normalized
graphics so equating the two to each
other and then maximum PC graphics with
high versus standard texture pack
resolution and we've got a couple of
other interesting points about how we
went through the testing process as well
before the comparison a few things to
note about the engine we noticed that it
appears as if Square Enix is using PBR
shaders or physically based rendering
PBR is calculated based on metalness and
roughness of a surface and mirrors
real-world lighting behavior in a full
implementation this would include
conservation of energy physically
correct distribute
in patterns and material definitions for
conductors and dielectrics and in the
case of Final Fantasies implementation
this shot of the truck chrome for
example the bottom layer near the step
on the truck best illustrates some
simple PBR implementations where the
material is both rough and 100% metal
and so we get reflections that are rough
across the surface rather than seeing a
full orb of light from the Sun being
reflected like we do in this tire
example we're seeing a more spread out
reflection of the Sun instead because it
is a rougher surface subsurface
scattering also appears early on where
an in-game rendered cutscene gives us a
glimpse of light scattering beneath the
surface of the mechanics nose the fact
that you can see blood capillaries
beneath the surface of the nose
particularly as found at the border of
shadows tell us that subsurface
scattering is probably used in the game
in the CG world like for movies where
you don't render in real-time this can
be a relatively expensive light bouncing
technique that would require tracing
light rays beneath the material surface
to better determine how light would
interact with blood vessels beneath the
surface of skin in this example in
traditional examples we could show you
images of earlobes fingers or other
areas of the body with very thin skin
where a red tint would be seen from the
blood beneath the surface of the skin if
you were to shine a light from the
opposing side and final fantasy cutting
our video back to the mechanic the
subsurface scattering is apparent in the
nose but we also believe this is
somewhat cheated in that's okay though
because the approximation looks good and
is reasonably accurate and also much
cheaper on system resource consumption
moving on to set up and test set up for
comparison versus the Xbox a couple of
notes on testing first off we always
restart the game between settings
changes to make sure they apply properly
because if you don't they will not apply
properly to match our PC settings to the
Xbox version we first selected the
default choice for every option which
got us 90% of the way there 90% of the
way to equalizing for the graphics on
the Xbox that includes average settings
for the model LOD anisotropic filtering
lighting shadows ambient occlusion and
filtering assets like the high quality
texture pack geo-mapping
or ground tessellation and all Nvidia
features were turned
off anti-aliasing was set to taa or
temporal anti-aliasing and motion blur
was turned on and just briefly this is
sort of old news now but temporal
anti-aliasing is something we covered in
the past basically it's the idea where
you have a frame to frame anti-aliasing
technique so the game is looking at the
previous frame and the current or the
next or upcoming frame comparing the two
and apply an anti-aliasing across them
as a delta so you end up with something
that in theory should be more accurate
frame to frame so that you get better
anti a seen in movement but it's not as
visible in still screenshots doesn't
always work out so well though as we'll
see in this game although this wasn't a
performance test we limited framerate to
the Xbox's cap of 30 FPS for good
measure and set resolution scallions
100% since dynamic resolution isn't
available on PC this is pretty close as
an approximation of what the Xbox is
capable of and it's an encouraging sight
the Xbox is quote-unquote high setting
is the PCs average in almost every
category
the only oddball setting listed is tier
a more texture Ram as the game calls it
which we set to highest this controls
the amounts of VRAM that the game can
request of the GPU which indirectly
controls that texture LOD there's no
separate texture quality setting the
Xbox didn't seem to have any problems
keeping textures in memory but the
average setting for trm on PC caused
visibly low resolution textures on
objects more than a short distance away
as we can show in a sign of a noodles
billboard so we turned this one up Final
Fantasy 15 doesn't offer extremely
detailed graphics adjustment so this
kind of indirect effect is seen in other
features for example adjusting lighting
effects reflections and the Nvidia flow
toggle isn't surfaced at all the nvidia
terrain tessellation toggle that was
accessible by modifying the benchmark
config files originally seems to now be
merged under the geo-mapping
label but enabling this option also
causes an increase in what we think are
possibly plain rock static meshes
comparing the Xbox one settings versus
the PC with max graphics bit unfair but
that's the point we can see where the
difference is a mirror
where some don't between the two titles
square emphasize that this wasn't more
than a port for PC they put a lot of
effort into it put about a year of work
into it and it works closely with the
major graphics provider and video so you
would assume that there would be major
graphics uplift versus the original
launch we thought this would be worth
comparing for Mac's vs Xbox settings we
can start with a side-by-side of pushing
the car the regalia where the Xbox is
immediately observable as lacking any
character model reflections or car
reflections from passersby the PC with
high settings that shows a vehicle and
character model reflections though with
the Xbox and lower settings PC version
reflecting only environment elements
like clouds
as for foliage and turf foliage is
sparse at these lower settings and grass
animations are stiff with Tufts of grass
clearly constructed of flat plains as
usual rather than any sort of particle
meshes as we think turf probably uses
their patches of ground are flat
textures with a few three-dimensional
rocks scattered over the surface and
enabling geo-mapping gives us terrain
tessellation and other effects that
deform the ground to create apparent
depth this is something you can also see
with small pebbles which are part of the
terrain tessellation and deformation
grass thickens with turf enabled
although we never did notice the
dynamically reactive grass and the part
of the game that we tested which was one
of the more heavily advertised features
from Nvidia's marketing materials that's
not to say that it doesn't happen but we
didn't notice it in this part of the
game later on a campfire reveals that
Nvidia flow is disabled with the average
settings on PC despite the lack of an
option in the menu
hair works is definitely not in use
although elaborate fur is still possible
without using it as we can see it in
both the Xbox and PC versions when the
bird swoops down early in gameplay hair
works isn't use on some mobs like the
first boss monster as we showed when we
tested the playable demo but not on the
main characters they appear to be using
normal meshes which we scraped from the
game to confirm using a scraping
application for view distance there's a
visible radius where shadows appear
trees and distant terrain and shadow pop
and is still a noticeable problem in all
settings configurations even with higher
settings although it's worse with the
lower or average settings for the
highest settings on PC as a side note we
did notice some odd graphical bugs that
that appeared with these settings but no
deal-breakers did Lorraine showed up on
locations like the margins of the road
where it fades into dirt possibly and
likely due to taa
we also saw taa issues in the benchmark
and the demo when we first tested it
where you can see issues with a truck
passing by having some ghosting or the
fishing pole being the easiest option
also having ghosting we think these were
likely at least in part due to taa with
maybe some motion blur thrown in taa was
enabled for every test including on the
Xbox and the dithering was present but
less visible with Xbox settings it could
be that it's intensified by the terrain
tessellation on the road side in this
earlier example and for one more non
deal breaking example of graphical bugs
we noticed a transparency issue with the
decal on the cab of the Hammerhead tow
truck and possibly a couple of other
places let's move on to a texture pack
comparison for Final Fantasy 15 this
part is exclusive to PC and will help us
establish our absolute maximum graphics
capabilities provided you have the
hardware to do it the texture pack is in
excess of 60 gigabytes and provides
minimally compressed textures at higher
resolutions and doesn't seem to affect
anything other than texture resolution
and quality
aside from cutscene quality as well you
must restart the game between settings
changes as noted as with any benchmark
otherwise the differences won't properly
emerge when you're toggling this on and
off in the game settings these are easy
the first Crofton screen shot is of a
wall post or the diner with clearly
crisper lines reduced aliasing and more
legible text when using the higher
resolution pack we also see this in the
service station texture where the rivets
and the walls are less blurry the pixels
around the circular edges are smooth and
the text is clearer not everything
benefits from the texture pack though
more important objects like the chocobo
vending machine have relatively equal
text or fidelity and resolution between
both the standard
and the high resolution PACs this is
also true for most character clothing
and other primary character objects
although Gladius for example has
slightly more detailed texturing and his
jacket with the high-res pack it's not
as severe as objects of less significant
another of those would be the steel
beams of some buildings for an
insignificant object where we can see
blur is reduced and grid is increased in
the higher resolution pack as for
whether this is worth 60 gigabytes of
space you'll have to ask the cutscenes
that's where most of the allocation goes
but generally speaking no not really
separately but related to textures we
also briefly tested the game's T RAM
setting this is the allocation of video
card memory to textures alone and this
noodle sign once again
somewhat shows the difference it's more
programmatic and dependent upon object
loading and requests to memory but
dropping the setting to average means
that textures will be reduced in quality
when either insignificant or at medium
view distances out of curiosity we
briefly tracked the vram consumption
with the texture pack enabled and
disabled but keep in mind that this is
an issue where the amount of memory used
appears to depend entirely on how much
the game is allowed to request based on
the T RAM setting so this is something
just like we've talked out in the past
we're using something like GPU Z or any
other software to show video memory
consumption is sort of lying to you it
does a good job at approximating but we
don't truly know how much memory Final
Fantasy is actually leveraging and using
every second as you play what we do know
is how much memory it requests so in
this case it's basically asking for all
of the memory on the card unless you
enable the lower tier am options like
average where it uses significantly less
and at that point we still don't know
how much memory it's using it for all
the assets we just know that it's asking
for less of the card so we don't truly
know how much B RAM is required to make
the game look the way it does at the
highest settings on our 1080 Ti but it's
a decent amount and in the very least it
does request all that does not mean you
need 11 gigabytes but it's asked
for it so Final Fantasy 15 windows
Edition is definitely the best looking
version of the game that's probably not
too much of a surprise it's refreshingly
easy to spot the improvements overall
between Xbox and PC turf effects and
terrain tessellation do a lot of the
work here in terms of making them look
different that doesn't mean it looks
better it's up to you to decide that but
to put our foot down a bit more in the
benchmark and the playable demo testing
we did previously it was hard to say
whether they the addition to the
experience was justified by the
performance hit something we tested more
previously it's not as bad as it was in
the benchmark definitely we we've now
basically been vindicated and have
validated our statements that the
benchmark is completely useless as a
tool because it doesn't mirror the
gameplay really at all a lot of stuff
has changed and improved the final
fantasy team Square Enix has done well
to improve those things and make sure
that things like hair hair works lod and
object : have been massively improved
something we talked on the playable demo
benchmarks where things that are distant
or at least now really low level of
detail to the point we're talking about
super low poly a couple of Polly's to
draw an entire tank for example as we
showed previously so they've definitely
improved it they've done well to address
a lot of the concerns that we had and as
far as the game work stuff a lot of that
is now bundled into other settings or is
minimized in some ways so a geo-mapping
appears to include terrain desolation
we're not clear on that that's kind of
educated speculation flow has been
merged into some other option as well
but it's also insignificant because it
only appears in campfires for the most
part and overall the game looks pretty
good it does have a couple of bugs we
don't really think the 65 gigabyte asset
pack is necessary at all and the
difference at this point comes down to
just normal Xbox vs PC Hardware
differences where the PC version
basically equals the Xbox if you drop
down to average settings so that's it
for this one if you want to see
performance video card performance and
so forth you can check our previous
content piece the playable demo
the benchmark 1 as stated in that
benchmark is basically entirely invalid
now because the benchmark was flawed so
don't use that to reference performance
anymore it does not apply to the final
game that's it for this one subscribe
