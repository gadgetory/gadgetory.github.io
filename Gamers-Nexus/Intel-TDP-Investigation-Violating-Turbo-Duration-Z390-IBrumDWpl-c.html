but this particular generation puts the
95 watt TDP under fire as users noticed
media outlets measuring power
consumption at well over 100 watts on
most boards it isn't uncommon to see the
900 K at 150 watts or more in some AVX
workloads like blender thus far and away
exceeding the 95 watt number
aside from TDP being an imperfect
specification for power there's also a
lot that isn't understood about it
including by motherboard manufacturers
apparently all manufacturers are
exceeding Intel guidance for the turbo
boosting duration in some way which is
causing the uncharacteristically high
power consumption that produces unfairly
advantaged performance results the other
end of this is that the 900 K looks much
better in some tests but it also looks a
lot hotter in thermal tests with the
lack of turbo duration guidance before
that this video is brought to you by
Thermaltake and the view 71 enclosure
the view 71 is a full tower case that's
capable of fitting three video cards and
most configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below getting into this
then as a reminder we had a power draw
chart during our streaming benchmarks in
the 9900 Kay review you might remember
that in that chart the 99 hundred K sort
of boosted up in power consumption and
eventually dropped down to 95 watts or
thereabouts where it stayed for the
duration of the test and that is
expected performance based on the specs
that Intelli has put out but in most
workloads it turns out with other
motherboards or even with the same one
that we use but with different settings
the Intel CPU far and away exceeds that
95 watt number it'll go up to 150 or
even 200 watts in some semi stock
scenarios with different motherboards
this comes down to a few things
primarily to motherboard vendors or
manufacturers exiting Intel guidance and
it's them doing so without really
telling anyone so you have to be savvy
enough to figure
out and then you need to figure out that
it's happened down on all the boards so
when you see this happening to
everywhere
you start to question your own sanity
like is this is it even wrong if all the
CPU is doing this power draw on every
motherboard that what is the spec and
that's what we're looking at today so
the ACS board when we tested it we
tested with XMP - which is the default
setting not the optimized setting and we
chose no - the prompt which disables MCE
now this time MC is a bit different
it's sneakier instead of just going all
Kord the single core max turbo which
would be 5.0 gigahertz it is instead
going to be correct all core turbo so it
looks fine it looks like MCS not even
doing anything but the sneaky part is
that it's blasting the turbo duration
with msie disabled on the Asus board and
this is the only one we've found so far
that does it properly disabled it sets
the correct
turbo boost limitation for time and that
means that the power after a fixed
period of time no more than 100 seconds
will throttle down to the 95 watt power
limit and that's something we need to
define here as well all the other boards
as you'll see in our testing today
violate this power limit and that's
where we get this huge discrepancy and
that's where the Intel 95 watt TDP that
you all have pointed out is questionable
at best so first you need to know about
power limits one and two parallel Emmitt
two is how much power the CPU can use in
bursts Intel's official document
describes this as quote a threshold that
if exceeded the power limit to rapid
power limiting algorithms will attempt
to limit the spike above PL to power
limit 1 is the maximum frequency under a
sustained load given in watts Intel's
document describes this one as quote a
threshold for average power that will
not exceed recommend to set to equal TDP
power PL 1 should not be set higher than
thermal solution cooling units that's an
exact quote from their document in other
words Intel recommends a 95 watt setting
but does not mandate it once ewm a power
or exponential weighted moving average
power is roughly equal to power limit
there is no more power budget for turbo
boosting and frequency down clocks as a
result of this we have a chart for that
one as well that's when it steps down to
power limit one levels exhibiting the
lower frequency will see in testing
later this is the Intel specification if
it were following at what we're seeing
on some motherboards you'd actually
instead see the power and frequency
blasted at those same peak frequencies
and PL two levels that you're seeing in
the chart in the same image tau is the
turbo time parameter which is dependent
on ewm a and follows the same curve
although there's a typo in there from
Intel Intel allows for up to 100 seconds
of P l2 or infinite PL one power is
allowed for PL 4 to be 10 milliseconds
max by Intel spec the hardware defaults
for PL 1 is 95 on an 8 core CPU or 119
Watts for PL 2 for the limited duration
allowed and that's also for an 8 core
Siegen bursts up to 119 watts with PL 2
or even higher with PL 4 but with PL 4
it's never more than 10 milliseconds
with PL 2 it's not supposed to be more
than 100 seconds and then finally note
that TDP is kind of nebulous usefulness
in general because as a number it
doesn't really mean a whole lot doesn't
mean literal power consumption it's
again it's it's a bit it's a bit
nebulous it's a Intel's measurement of
TDP is more about cooler ability to
dissipate heat than anything it's not a
literal power metric it can be
significantly different from the actual
power metric which makes it difficult to
use so we were talking to Shannon Rob
another reviewer about all this from
urine 3d and he saw similar stuff that
we did so let's get into the charts and
look at what we found with the different
motherboards for the turbo duration
issue power consumption is the most
important for this one scene as it is a
TDP rating discussion we're measuring
power in two places we have EPS 12 volt
measurements have the power supply
cables via a current clamp then we also
have hardware info software measurements
the to ensure that we have reliability
and can trust the data between each
measurement we're also going to be
showing the power within the first 30
seconds of load which will better
illustrate at what point any throttle
kicks in this chart shows a lot of range
first of all none of these results
involve manual overclocking we only ever
changed one or two settings one of which
would have been XMP out of all these
results there's only one that follows
Intel specification that's the ASUS
Maximus 11 hero with no selected to the
enhancement prompt after enabling XMP
for this one we measured about 98 watts
down the EPS 12-volt cables which is
within reasonable margin of error for
the 95 watt TDP specification though TDP
again isn't really a perfect number this
is within spec so far for the first 30
to 60 seconds we observe it dwindling at
power consumption from 140 watts to 120
watts before eventually falling off to
98 watts this is due to turbo boost
duration policies something we'll show
in another chart coming up and this is
ultimately what all of the boards should
look like for power metrics speaking of
that other chart for reference here's
what the frequency functionality looks
like when operating under settings with
MCE disabled via XMP 2 and selecting the
no prompt this plot takes place over a
23 minute blender render or there abouts
so this is a real-world use case of the
99 hundred K notice that there's a sharp
fall-off after about 30 seconds where
average all core frequency plummets from
4.7 gigahertz to 4.2 gigahertz notice
that the power consumption remains at
almost exactly 95 watts for the entire
test pegged to 94.9 watts and relatively
flat this corresponds to the right axis
with frequency on the left it sort of
feels like an RT X flashback where we're
completely power limited the difference
is that this is under the specification
despite the CPU clearly being capable of
more you'll see that the frequency picks
up again when the workload ends leaving
us with unchallenged idle frequencies
let's get that power chart back on the
screen here's the weird thing if you
leave the Asus board to just auto
without any form of XMP without any MCE
modifications whatsoever then the
multi-core enhancement feature is left
to auto as well this seems reasonable
but in this version of multi-core
enhancement instead of boosting to the
maximum single core frequency which is
very obvious when done and violates spec
of course
asus is extending the turbo-boost
eration that's a new form of MCE
it's tricky and it's well hidden rather
than boost visibly different numbers
like applying the single core boost
modifier to all cores the board is
allowing turbo to last ad infinitum the
fact that the board operates outside of
spec when auto but inside of spec when
XMP is on and with no selected is a
really odd choice to say the least you'd
expect a more consistent policy with
Auto probably following the spec more
closely
if anything it seems as if a snus hasn't
decided if it wants to be within spec
and lose to other boards or exit spec
and exceed TDP let's get the EVGA
outlier out of the way this is what
power consumption looks like when you
completely disable Intel's turbo boost
functionality it's obviously awful as
you're not really supposed to do this it
runs the CPU way slower this establishes
though that turbo is within TDC
specifications of course but only when
turbo duration is properly controlled by
the motherboard manufacturer EVGA did
not appear to have an MCE option of any
kind and only had the normal turbo
toggle so we decided to use it as a
vessel for testing that power
consumption baseline with no turbo
boosting whatsoever next the other end
of the chart shows the MSI godlike with
enhanced turbo explicitly enabled as
pulling 192 washdown the EPS 12-volt
cables for reference enhanced turbo is
natively set to auto which has an
infinite turbo duration and violates TDP
under all motherboard settings enabling
enhanced turbo explicitly will boost all
core frequency to 5.0 gigahertz and is
basically a new version of MCE
it is however sort of off by default in
that auto and off are the same thing and
on boost a single core frequency across
all cores so really it's often auto
violate the turbo boost duration spec
and then on is a user activated function
that pre overclock see that's the real
meaning if we highlight the complete
auto MSI configuration no changes at all
that has us at 150 watts draw not
anywhere close to the power figures
cited by Intel technically this makes
MSI the ones at fault but we don't know
if there any behind-the-scenes politics
that could influence things MSI
also exits back with enhanced turbo set
to auto which keeps the 4.7 gigahertz
ratio but also removes the turbo
duration limits to say when enhanced
turbo explicitly leaves us in the same
spot
turbo durations still have no power
limits and the power is still at about
150 to 155 watts there's there's no
limit within the duration that one would
expect by Intel spec instead it's
basically infinite here's the frequency
versus time plot when Emma size godlike
is involved for this setup the asus
board is still set to follow spec and
has MC e disabled the MSI board is under
it's Auto enhanced turbo settings which
are the same as it's disabled enhanced
turbo settings in this example the MSI
board is holding strong to 4735
megahertz which is violating the spec in
multiple ways sort of cheating for one
BC LK is 100.8 which we already
discussed for to the turbo duration
limit is removed under these Auto
settings and all settings actually and
so it holds a higher ratio power draw is
also higher peg to 152 watts instead of
95 from Asus and that extra 60 watts
goes a long way toward performance back
to power one more time with ACS
selecting yes to the prompt puts us at
around 142 Watts right around where the
others are at this point the only
difference between EVGA MSI and Asus is
the automatic voltage provision EVGA has
the tightest speed core and so draws
less power as you can see in these power
numbers but also is exiting the turbo
duration spec for reference our initial
review is done with the correct setting
we use the asus motherboard with XMP -
and no selected at the prompt and so our
results follow the Intel spec and
guidelines that's because we learned
about this last time with a z3 70 if we
used a different motherboard though our
results would be higher and our thermals
would be higher significantly and our
power would also be higher so that's
where some of the confusion came in a
couple weeks ago from the reviews we
have two performance tests to look at
the first one is a truncated test
rendering our GM logo seen at only 20
percent resolution you can see the
normal GM logo rendered on the screen
now it's been playing for a little bit
and this is what the scene the final
result looks like it's
real-world use case of these higher-end
CPUs it's one frame from our intro
animation to this very video the second
performance test is the normal 50%
resolution render which takes about half
an hour even on a good CPU for the 20%
resolution test the shorter one you'll
see that only three items are outside of
the error margins and are quickly
identifiable at the low end of the chart
the EVGA FTW with turbo completely
disabled this is obviously bad and not
something you should be using but we did
that that wasn't an EVGA default spec or
setting that's where Intel would be at
65 watts with the 9900 K more critically
the asus hero with MCE completely
disabled selecting no at the XMP prompt
performs noticeably worse than the other
motherboards Asus gets punished for
partially following Intel spec though
their auto setting still exceeds it so
we can't give Asus too much credit here
they're not really the good guys it's
just they were less bad than some of the
others at 4.2 minutes to render the logo
we're taking 11 percent longer to render
the logo than the rough average of 3.8
minutes for the other boards here's the
full render we only have a few of the
9900 Carranza's on here as it takes so
long to run this test it's just enough
to make a point
our original review used the correct
settings to follow Intel spec and so is
the worst of the 900 K results that's at
twenty five point five minutes which is
just ahead of the r7 2700 at 4.2
gigahertz it's about a minute faster
it's about three minutes fast for them
the 8700 K at five gigahertz and
significantly slower than the 70 900 x10
core CPU stock with the MSI godlike and
EVGA FTW extended turbo durations we saw
a render time reduced by about 9.3
percent that's noteworthy and diminishes
the gap between the 7900 X while
widening the gap between the twenty
seven hundred and twenty seven our X
stand in at 4.2 gigahertz finishing in
twenty three minutes instead of twenty
five point five might not sound like a
lot but it's all about scale if you're
an animator you're likely rendering
thousands of frames a 10 percent
requirement reduction in time per frame
will add up very fast and so it's
misleading the show performance numbers
outside of the spec at the same time
though if all of the board's violate the
spec maybe it isn't misleading if that's
the reality
then the inaccuracy is in showing the
power
figures not in the performance figures
either way both cannot be simultaneously
accurate will leave thermals for another
piece we have those as well but we're
gonna push that with some other key
insights that we ran some extra tests
into another content piece this one that
you should have a pretty good idea of
where things stand now clearly the one
instance that we've seen thus far and
we're boards we didn't show here but as
ROC Tai Chi follows the same behavior as
the others except for the ASIS MCE off
one so the ASIS board is the only one
when you physically go in there and
enable XMP and disable MCE that's the
only one that really follows the spec
everyone expects when they see 95 watts
that's what we used in our review we had
experience with this from Z 370 but if
you didn't have that board or as a user
you don't buy that board you're never
gonna be up that number and unless you
have that board and other boards you
really can't compare them and figure out
this is clearly what they meant when
they said 95 Watts so asus is following
the spec to some degree they're not
angels here though they're also
violating it with Auto settings which
just seems completely backwards but
either way at some point you're left
asking who's really at fault here
because intel has guidance that document
we showed earlier is from Intel they've
set guidance they've set parameters but
they're not necessarily being strict
enough with them and so a motherboard
manufacturers are doing whatever they
want now apparently Intel's going to be
more strict this generation which is why
you see Asus buckling down on it where
previously they didn't and in fact asus
was responsible for a lot of the sort of
trickery that happened in previous
generations so Intel might be starting
to crack down on this but for now can
you blame the motherboard manufacturers
or do you blame Intel because
motherboard manufacturers are doing
whatever they can to make their boards
look better than the other but at the
same time it makes Intel look better
sort of unfairly so really what should
probably happen is Intel should drop the
95 watt number that's used and cited
everywhere since it only applies under
those certain scenarios described
earlier and the boards don't really
follow it and instead cite higher
performance with a higher power
consumption because those two go
together
as opposed to the basically impossible
to achieve power consumption
under all these other motherboards
parameters except for one in one
specific setting and and the higher
performance there right now they're
doing two things in opposition to each
other when they need to be doing two
things either together proportionately
rather than inversely which is what
Intel is trying to do with respect so
it's a question of who do you blame
Intel for not being strict enough with
the guidance that they do have or the
motherboard vendors for sidestepping the
guidance constantly and running
basically out of spec and you're left
here with basically just ASIS in one
setting doing this spec that like
running at spec running where they
should be so if it's just one under one
setting then is it even a spec is it
even guidance because it's just making a
serious look Pat at that point instead
of what everyone else is doing so that's
it for this one hopefully that answers
some questions as to what what's the
deal with TDP why they say 95 watts and
it's not not if i watch the answer is
turbo duration and you're allowed to
boost outside of TDP it's like a hundred
twenty watts or there abouts it's one
point two five times pl-1 but it's not
supposed to be sustained and that's
where these manufacturers are kind of
cheating and then PL 3 + PL 4 can be
exceeded also so that's it for this one
