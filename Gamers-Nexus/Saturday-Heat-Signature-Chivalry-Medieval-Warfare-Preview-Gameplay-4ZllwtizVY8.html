XS tonight and we are covering chivalry
today in episode 6 of Saturday heat
signature which is our series that
covers up and coming games that don't
quite have the hype that they deserve
and so we are talking about chivalry
medieval warfare today which is the
follow-up game to the source engine mod
age of chivalry which we actually
covered it back in the very very early
days of gamers Nexus so chivalry
medieval warfare is actually a really
cool take on the old mod basically it's
a first-person medieval combat game it's
within an abundance of weapons and you
just kill your enemies take the
objectives and there's a lot more to it
than that but we'll get to that in a
second because first I want to talk
about the idea and the backing for the
game in essence it is multiple kingdoms
fighting back in the medieval days so it
is more of a realistic medieval game and
not so much of a fantasy game but that
is no reason to look the other way
because it is a very good looking
medieval game and if it is anything like
age of chivalry I have no doubt in my
mind that this game will have some
pretty cool features so let's look at
those features they have said that they
are aiming for an a cinematic fast paced
hollywood-style action they are going
for an objective based play for
multiplayer there are different
multiplayer modes but the the flagship
mode is a team objective mode which
basically means instead of takeover site
a or tight takeover site B or defense I
air defense site B which works perfectly
in a game like counter-strike this game
in a medieval world it's not quite as
simple as hey go take that village over
there no your Knights are not going to
stand for that they are going to kill
everything in that village and then
they're going to see all their food
that's just that's how it works so your
secondary objectives your sub objectives
are attempting to mask that take over
style play which switch plays games like
this so much and just makes them really
repetitive so it is a mask of course the
primary goal is still to just take
something over but it's not quite as
simple as that you might have to kill or
free peasants or kill Kings what invade
towns break in two castles rammed down
the gates stuff like that you have to
charge through courtyards and
preset campaign but it is very
fast-paced and it helps to make it feel
like hey I'm actually supposed to do
something not just go take over that
thing that's marked with an a it's a lot
a lot more detailed than that and that
really helps to make sure the game has
better longevity better overall duration
of gameplay let's move on though to the
way that multiplayer maps are actually
separated out they are set into what's
called a campaign well or what we call a
campaign anyway which basically means a
ton of prepackaged maps that you have to
go through in order to win or lose the
level so you might let's say we have an
attacking and defending team the
defending team is defending a city the
attacking team is attacking the city
pretty simple but it is a bit more
complex than that because the defending
team will first say they start outside
the walls they're trying to stop the
attackers room coming in and eventually
after a couple minutes the attackers are
able to get a battering ram up to the
gates and ram down the gate so then what
might happen depending on the map of
course you jump to the next separated
part of that campaign the next level and
now the defenders are defending a
courtyard or a marketplace and the
attackers of course have to take it over
and that's where killing peasants and
all that stuff comes in that we earlier
talked about there are multiple phases
through each team and it does a lot more
than I'm going to defend this bomb site
for ten minutes get bored and quit now
you actually do have a progressive
objective to work toward now we can talk
about some of the mechanics because
those are just as deserving as the
gameplay that we've been talking about
first of all combat it is to quote the
developer freeform fully directional
skill based attacks and blocking which
effectively means that it is free form
meaning you can swing your sword and if
you decide to alter your path of that
sword let's say your enemy jumps or
ducks you dynamically counter and change
your direction of that attack because
you're so quick with your reflexes and
so you swing up to hit him when he's
jumping well because the hit tracing for
the weapon is actually drawn in real
time so it's not like you swing that and
then you have a predefined path that
you're going to hit no it's much better
than that if you swing and they move and
then you move you might actually hit him
even though you already clicked before
he moved and that is just because as you
saw in the video i just showed the
tracing behind the weapon has drawn in
real time and each weapon has unique
tracing for the most part so that really
makes for very fluid combat and it makes
for including these other combat
dynamics that have been added to the
game like dodging ducking blocking and
parrying there are four primary classes
in chivalry medieval warfare there will
be a man-at-arms class which is a light
mail a warrior so they are great
flankers for that reason because they're
quick they have speed abilities that can
help them destroy harassment units like
archers and they just really good for
getting in and out of situations there
are also archers of course excellent
harasses from afar also vanguards the
third class they are considered the
balance class they have great reach
weapons finally we have Knights who are
your tank class you're really slow
moving high damage dealing they soak up
all of those extra hits but to close up
here I want to go back to the real time
tracing of attacks because as a player
alternates his attack pattern we can
have some pretty cool results so let me
give you an example here let's say you
and I are fighting and we swing at the
same time and we're the same class of
the same weapon now I swing a little bit
higher and you swing a little bit lower
if I hit you it's more deadly if you hit
me I might still be alive for this
reason you now decide the whole your
weapon with your mouse of course up as
high as you can to try and collide with
my weapon as it's coming towards your
face and you succeed in this you manage
to pull your weapon up and it does
collide so that my weapon is now not
going to hit you in the face and it is
going to hit your sword and then we'll
keep fighting because you're still alive
so that's really freaking cool if I'm
honest it is one of the coolest things
that I have seen for heat signature
games in terms of mechanics so far so
I'm pretty pumped about this game it is
coming out later this year 2012 i
believe it is now so keep an eye out on
that please like this video if you liked
it comment below if you have any
questions at all and subscribe subscribe
subscribe and I will talk to you guys
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
