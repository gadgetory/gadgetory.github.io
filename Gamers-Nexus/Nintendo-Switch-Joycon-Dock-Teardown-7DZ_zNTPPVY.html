Nintendo switch teardown we're currently
down to the screen that's something I'm
trying to figure that out how to get the
screen off and separated might do that
later but today we are tearing down what
remains that'll be the dock and the joy
cons which I don't know really that I
expect to find a whole lot in here
that's useful to me but maybe to some
controller modders out there we can we
can find something that's helpful in the
future we're going to sort with the
doctor see if there's anything
interesting in here I know it's got a
bit more going on than just a charging
setup and a charging pass-through but
before getting to that this content is
brought to you by ifixit.com we're going
to be using iFixit tools for this tear
down including the protec toolkit that
we use all the time for a GPU teardown
you can use code gamers nexus at their
website for a $5 off coupon
so starting with the dock this one looks
pretty simple compared to the switch
itself which it wasn't necessarily hard
it's a hell of a lot of ribbon cables
and small screws a lot more than really
seem necessary and I've still got it on
the magnetic mat in front of me so this
one is all why screws that all those tri
wing screws it looks like just for
notation purposes that there are four of
the Y or the tri wing screws there one
on the bottom left from that orientation
one Center top right bottom right and I
believe that's all for what we can see
so far so let's start with those that
should be pretty straightforward
let's straight forward
that comes off and then is there
anything left
not really exa phillips-head seems like
the trend is generally speaking to do
the Philips are silver and the Y ones
are generally black so that gives us USB
2 there's a USB 2 there we're connected
here for USB - and what did those screws
I just undid do ah a bunch of screws
down these holes they're hard to they're
hidden if you get over to see those you
have the right angle okay so we get so
separated that's starting go up this
pull apart it looks like oh yeah one
more screw okay we've got power powers
disconnected and this little module is a
what goes in here for your USB 2 and one
USB 3 port which I believe is what does
the planet was a cease later or
something so there's your 3.0 conserve
of course is 2.0 type C and HDMI
connector all on this side and that's
the side that faces internally
externally 2 USB 2 power cable and I'm
guessing like a data ribbon or something
and what else is on here so this Center
module right there notes are three 2p 0
4 8 top line CR a second line gh T 7 d 9
3 third line and CH n 6 3 8 4 the fourth
line yeah so it's an STM microcontroller
not 100% positive I believe it's some
arm based controller so that's the
centerpiece and then what else do we
have the Li what do they make
here the oii is making the VLP 100 - q4
datasheet USB 3.0 hub micro control or
controller rather supports rapid
charging over USB enabled devices
charging of devices at rates and access
of baseline USB standards the current
limit of USB 2.0 this is when I was
written of course it's 500 milliamps
reconfigured devices and the current
limit that USB 3.0 is nine hundred
milliamps so that's your limited current
and they are saying the fan and device
rapid charging implements typical
typically at feature current limits
between at 1,000 milliamps to 2,000
milliamps support simultaneous
SuperSpeed high speed and full speed
traffic and low speed traffic for
downstream ports one upstream port and
how USB advanced CMOS for low power
consumption there's a lot of data out
there on that on that USB controller
we've got our STMicroelectronics
controller processor or MTU vli USB
controller tops i don't know if there's
anything relative note now I've got
another there's one more Philips here
and then two more down these that hole
and down that hole so we're going to
start with this one it's accessible one
more one more hidden under the ribbon
this is three over here and three over
here
cool
so let's go together like that spring
necks charging electronics for the USB
pass-through with the charge device with
another spring down here in the very
base so I think that spring kind of
looking at this is just to push this
thing out of the way so the two ports
can mate obviously what else is going on
I think that might really might be it
this looks like it covers everything oh
this thing's for the LED if you're
wondering what that cables for so
there's an LED they're charging LED
plugs into the PCB and on this PC v8
that's in here for the connection to the
switch is connected via this ribbon
cable to the the microbes
stmicroelectronics
and the vli board for everything else so
I think that covers this thing I'm not
really sure there's much else we can do
here stick this aside and start working
on one of the controllers I think we
want the red controller because this is
the one with the IR camera in it it's
got a bit more going on so we're going
to take that apart the controllers help
together by a bunch of Y screws again
four of them or the widest criticism I
use that's trivial
there's our battery just say except
pencil on it is easy L is the what's
controller this right comes already
let's get lower down on that there's the
battery there's a battery now that
wasn't a bad me though that was the IR
camera this is the battery I ready to
unplug the battery you pull up okay so
I guess it's going to be not great to
put back together because of Springs do
that that looks like the NFC potentially
so if that is I'm not super familiar
with NFC to be honest because it's in
the mobile world and we don't work with
those devices but my assumption would be
that's what this is if someone knows
feel free to comment but I would that
would be my guess which that's right
there and so that would be around here
on the controller puff the analog stick
that's yeah that's right here so okay
what else we got the battery
what is the battery just for people who
want to replace later the battery is h
AC 0 0 6 and h AC - a - b pj MX - CO and
then it is a three point seven volt 25
milli amp our 1.9 watt hour battery and
i think that that's probably everything
everyone needs to know okay so we got
the battery and all this stuff the only
I see i/o it's Broadcom so that's broad
Tom makes all the wireless tech
generally wireless an NFC stuff so the
Broadcom chip it is BC mt-07 3 for you
ai and then check a mind k FF b 3g third
line at UK 1 6 3 either 0 or D P 11 and
last line at 6 2 4 5 2 3 T 2 so that's
that one Brown who cares to look it up
enough CDE a next to it that's right
there that's that chip
blue cable goes into the closest
connector
so there's your analog stick is your
padding for the buttons right there I
can see that squish when you push them
there's the underside sensors and that's
what you're actually actually pushing
when it depresses so that's what gets
pushed three or four buttons then
there's another button up there another
button right there so there's your
switches now how long those last I don't
know they're not labeled or anything to
have no idea well I think that's
everything for this controller can't get
any more torn down than that ir is right
there and we've already taken everything
else apart HD rumble huh another has to
think it whatever it is is in there but
that seems like it's just probably
controller for this analog stick
definitely not on to the battery it's
going to suck to put back together I'm
not sure where the HD Rumble comes from
okay so I think I think that's about as
far as we can get here I'm not sure
where that has a whole HD Rumble thing
works I haven't read any documentation
or anything like that or seen anything
beyond their video where they doing that
ice cubes comparison so I'm not positive
where that originates maybe someone in
the comments has a better idea
I don't again I don't work with these
types of devices I don't work with
phones we're just taking it apart so if
you can feel it on the top middle and
bottom on this controller I would have
to guess there's something going on here
or here but I don't know exactly exactly
how that works
hollar goes all the buttons I had to get
a screw out of there so I dumped
everything out instead yeah this is not
gonna be fun to put back together I
wouldn't recommend it on my seat replace
a battery or something if you replace in
the battery that's not too hard so the
first thing that is exposed and I would
imagine at some point there will be
those batteries on sale on eBay or
something probably straight from the
factory with with no brandy common so
so you might be able to use their
service the battery if you want to in
the future because of course let's the
oh my on batteries don't last forever
they do start to reduce as you've grown
through charge cycles they reduce their
battery life and endurance but that is
the joy calm the right joy Khan and the
doc and when we previously tore down the
switch itself
and now I need to put it all back
together but that's point I'm going to
happen because we're working on the
1080p I and a couple more rise in SKUs
