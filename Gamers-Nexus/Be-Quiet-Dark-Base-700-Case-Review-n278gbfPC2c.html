quiets dark bass 700 loosely related to
the high-cost dark bass pro 900
invertible enclosure the 700 retains the
invertible motherboard option but
reduces physical size and uses different
tooling and key locations dark bass 700
also markets itself as a mid tower
alternative to the 900 with a focus on
silent operation and cooling combined
generally speaking it's impossible to
chart-topper both of these aspects in a
case but be quiet employs a fan speed
switch with multiple speed settings to
give users options today we're reviewing
the case at its $180 price point as
compared to alternatives on the market
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal grizzly makers of the
conductor not liquid metal that we
recently used to drop 20 degrees off of
our coffee lake temperatures
thermal grizzly also makes traditional
thermal compounds we use on top of the
IHS like cryo nod and hydronaut pastes
learn more at the link below we just
pushed our case awards video for the
year before this one went live but
already knew everything about it because
we've been testing it for a while so
first thing here one of the items we
noted in that case awards video was a
general lack of USB type-c in modern
cases for the year
the dark bass 700 this case actually has
a type C in the front next to a fan
controller and if you look closely at it
it's a repurposed normal USB type a slot
two of them that have been given type C
and a fan controller so basically it
looks like the tooling was already done
and be quiet
went back and modified it or took old
tooling from something else and then put
those two items in the same port with
just some filler plastic around it
pretty clever solution because most the
other cases on the market haven't
figured that out yet so we'll point that
out now the marketing push here is
focusing on both silence and noise and
it's effectively impossible to do both
of those well so that comes back to the
fan controller fan controller on this
has two different toggles silence and
performance mode and that it's got three
speed levels for those so you switch
between the three speed levels that you
pick either silence or performance and
then you basically judge what you need
based on your workload as four core
features this is an inverter
case meaning that the motherboard tray
can again be flipped upside down and
moved to the other side of the case and
every component of the case side panels
harddrive cages power slash shroud etc
can be repositioned to fit this
configuration some of our complaints
with the 900 have been resolved now the
manual has a single chapter of
step-by-step instructions for instance
and there are clearly defined layouts
standard or inverted to choose from
within the manual one of the best things
about the 700 invertibility is that it's
practically unnoticeable when unused
there are no weird compromises made to
make the invertible layout possible and
that's just like the 900 was the
motherboard tray of the 700 can be
removed it sort of painlessly there are
11 screws that hold it in place and it
can be used as a test bench if you
really wanted to as it even has little
legs on the corners for this purpose the
PSU shroud is the most visible
difference from the dark base 900 for
removable plastic sections cover the top
of the shroud and one large plastic
panel covers the side the underlying
steel framework is permanent but these
plastic sections can be removed as
desired or shifted around for inversion
the plastic panels are slightly popped
up to leave small airflow gaps as a
common feature would be quiet cases
there are no 3.5 inch base visible in
the 700 but that doesn't mean they
aren't there there are 5 mounting points
beside the motherboard for the be quiet
distinctive free-floating hard drive bay
deployment that they tend to use each is
capped by an adjustable plastic cover
that allows room for cable routing when
not in use the two bays included with
the case are hidden beneath the power
splash shroud for a total of seven
possible 3.5 inch locations although
only two can be used simultaneously
without additional bays the +2 PCI slots
listed in a spec sheet refers to the
vertical GPU mount which proves
difficult to use as always as for any
type of GPU that is a taller PCB in
combination with an air cooler this
happens whether or not you have an
open-loop setup on your GPU it's just
that as long as you use a reference
board you'll be fine
otherwise you can use a taller GPU but
no air cooler one or the other there's
relatively little clearance between the
shroud and the edge of the card where
the PCIe riser cable plugs in and some
cables may be difficult
without removing the panels from the
shroud getting into testing the fan
controller has three manual settings and
auto which accepts PWM input from the
motherboards fan header one important
note is that the fan controller has two
channels each of which can separately be
set to either silent or performance with
toggles on the PCB both channels were
set to silent by default in our sample
and silent mode level 3 which we used
for most tests these silent wins three
fans run at about eleven hundred rpm
which is the maximum speed while in
silent mode performance mode level 3
used in the max fans beam tests pushes
them to their rated speed of 1600 rpm
and is expectedly significantly louder
when using just the stock fans we'd
recommend using performance mode level 1
is still quiet and level 3 is the
greatest possible air flow but the
silent mode is more of what it's
marketed toward with additional fans of
different speeds users could experiment
with setting one channel to performance
and one to silent the idea is ultimately
that you set multiple zones in the case
but we'd recommend generally just
matching them to the fan speeds for the
least turbulent noise there's obviously
a big focus on silence in every be quiet
case it's kind of the name the
tempered-glass models like this one
can't have as much noise damping foam as
the previous versions without Windows
three panels front top and side are
padded and the thicker glass will at
least help with reducing long wavelength
of noise from exiting the case so it
doesn't help with higher frequency stuff
like coil wine there's a reason why we
didn't do every test at 1600 rpm max fan
speeds looking at our noise chart now
reach forty three point four or DBA and
that's on the same level as the Corsair
v 70 X running three fans at 1550 rpm
and these silverstone are l06
with four 120 fans and completely
ventilated at mesh what be quiet calls
l-shaped noise damping vents end up
backfiring when too much air is forced
through them the pressure is just
creating turbulence and noise the 90
degree turns mean that you're losing
some pressure every time you silent
winds three fans are capable of moving a
lot of air but they're also fighting the
front panel just like a lot of cases
these days the difference here is that
be quiet actually advertise a silence so
the closed off front panel is sort of
necessary to achieve that to the maximum
it's just a question of when they've
gone too far we can look at that and the
thermal results to see if that's the
case at level three silent mode roughly
1,100 rpm noise levels were much more
reasonable around the Rosewell Cullinan
and coarser 270 are level one slowed the
fans to just 450 to 500 rpm but it also
made the 700 quieter than anything we've
tested since the pure bass 600 also at
minimum rpm level three silent is a good
compromise between noise and airflow for
testing purposes it does becomes a
question again of where the thermals
land we'll look at that next in addition
to the stock configuration that fan
level 3 silent
we tested maximum and minimum fan speeds
as it governed by the controller out to
the GP vertically and removed all the
plastic covers from the shroud our
thermal test start with torture
workloads which bring the CPU and GPU
simultaneously temperatures are reported
as delta T over ambient again we're
starting with just the dark bass 700
then adding the others with no fan went
to directly at the cooler the stock
configuration CP 2000 T rose to sixty
point six degrees Celsius cranking the
fans up to their maximum speed lowered
the delta to fifty four point six and
turning them all the way down raised it
to seventy four point six where we saw
definite thermal throttling on the CPU
we rarely see this the minimum fan speed
should never be used under serious load
especially not in a torture test like
this we recommend only using minimum fan
speeds when dealing with idle or near
idle working states like web browsing it
is then critical to remember to turn
that back up when you start gaming
rendering or doing anything intensive
that's the important part remember to
change it mounting the GPU vertically
lowered CPU temperature slightly the 57
point three degrees Celsius delta T over
a man's and that's pretty much been what
we've seen in past tests this is
primarily because the card is no longer
radiating heat directly into the CPU
cooler and it doesn't block air flowing
into it
removing plastic sections from the
shroud to potentially raise the CPU
temperature what the results were within
test variants and deviation comparative
temperatures our next sixty point six
degrees Celsius delta T is relatively
warm around the in wind 303 and BitFenix
Shogun and just slightly cooler than the
toasty antec pH or BitFenix and so add
that fans be
it's also as loud or louder than all of
them 54.6 is a more respectable Delta
around solid performers like the Corsair
270 R and thermaltake meu 71 but it's
also much louder than all the nearby
cases the dark bass 700 fails to offer
superior noise the thermal performance
and the stock configuration and does not
offer a particularly compelling
standalone thermals or particularly
compelling standalone noise that is not
until we go to minimum fan speeds for
low load operation but the minimum fan
speed allowed our CPU to hit 100 degrees
Celsius during thermal testing so it can
be considered a failure in the range of
the in wind 8:05 infinity overall CPU
temperatures were a bit disappointing
but there's only one intake fan and it's
not pointed out the CPU it's still an
improvement over the pure bass 600 but
at its best instances this case is
simply middle-of-the-pack nothing
special at all GPU if they're all
results our next starting again with
data for just the dark bass 700 our 1100
rpm fan settings scored a GPU DT of 52.3
degrees Celsius and maxing out the fans
only lowered that a couple of degrees to
50 point 5 degrees Celsius well we're in
the fan speed predictably spikes
temperature up to fifty eight point nine
over ambient mousing the GPU vertically
caused the usual overheating this time
reaching a delta T of 70 point four
degrees Celsius while removing shroud
sections again had practically no effect
at all the intention was to allow more
air to circulate the bottom of the case
and lower GPU temperatures for the stock
intake fan is positioned right above the
PSU shroud so that does its job just
fine and regardless of whether the
shroud is they're comparing GPU
temperatures reveals where all the
incoming air is going 52 point three
degrees Celsius delta T over ambient is
comparable to the NZXT H 700 I and the
Thermaltake Corp III open-air case the
maximum performance of fifty point five
degrees celsius pushes it to the top of
the GPU chart alongside the cooler
master see 700 P even with the fans at
minimum speed the GBO temperature isn't
at the bottom of the chart like it was
for CPU temperature and fifty eight
point nine degrees Celsius is still
several degrees under the BitFenix Enzo
and an Tek p8 the dark bass 700 does
significantly better in its GPU cooling
making us wonder if relocating the rear
exhaust fan as front
intake may be better for the CPU
thermals when using air coolers there's
700 GPU thermals in 3dmark firestrike
are among the best performers in the
stress test that's a result of two
things one all of the air is going
straight to the GPU and we've already
proven that the GPU does much better
than the CPU and two we haven't tested
as many cases in this benchmark so
there's less competition at fifty four
point six degrees Celsius the case is
slightly outdone by the thermal take
view 71 even though this test tends to
cause even higher GPU temperatures than
the torture test the dark bass handled
it well the CPU temperature of 35 Cu in
this test was comparatively warm looking
at the others and nearer the spec Oh 4
or thermal take T 21 we've been on 2
blender a realistic blender CV workload
had the CPU temperature is still
relatively warm at thirty nine point
five degrees Celsius just a bit over the
thermal take G 21 as far away from
t.j.maxx
but outperformed by the dark base nine
hundred and even the aged 500 P a
thermally unimpressive case rendering
our test image on the GPU resulted in
GPUs averages of 26 degrees Celsius
delta T over a man's again comparable to
the view 71 and competitively cool but
700 outperforms the 900 here as well as
most of the other cases we've tested
with blender except the H 700 I and as
always the redline zero six this case is
kind of boring overall but that's not
necessarily an insult to be quiet be
quiet and fractal both take a more
visually boring approach to cases and
that's perfectly fine a lot of people
want that the thing is though it's not
particularly exciting in noise or
thermals be quiet manages to best itself
with other cases in each category and
with this setup right here what we end
up with is a noise situation where it's
not the quietest in its stock
configuration it's closed at 33.1 DBA or
decibels unfortunately it also can't
really play games at that closer setting
the silent one setting so without the
help of liquid cooling to brute force
this what you end up with is silent 3
being the best for performance but is
that 36 decibels so it's
middle-of-the-pack to bottom half of the
pack
and that keeps us non throttling but
it's also just it's not that impressive
of a noise level the temperatures are
the same so it's if you want to get mid
pack average temperatures with this case
you end up with some of the worst the
noise levels we have on the charts and
if you wanted to get the quieter
quietest noise levels you end up with
some of the worst thermals so it's it's
kind of you can pick the middle but then
you just end up with something
completely average and at 180 dollars
completely average isn't really an
acceptable starting point for a case
stock now that said there's a lot of
credit to be given here the build
quality is exceptional in the case it's
got a lot of metal paneling the
invertible tray makes it one of the
cheaper if not the cheapest invertible
ATX case that is on the market right now
and the build quality and modularity of
all the panels that can be removed and
inverted are also pretty high quality
which for a case that can be flipped
around completely to the other side is
somewhat remarkable because typically
you have companies that are forced to
cut corners in order to make modularity
happen and you either end up with
something that is visually unappealing
in some configurations or stuff that
just feels cheap
be quiet manages to avoid those issues
they have higher quality feel they have
higher quality build in general it's
just a matter of being choked for air
once again and here's the thing
be quiet isn't targeting a high airflow
case so that's a lot less relevant than
with other cases but they are targeting
something that can do lower noise and
the issue is be quiet ends up in a
situation where their case isn't the
quietest and when you kind of roughly
normalize for noise it's also not the
coolest so it's just it's lacking both
ends of the argument which makes it
average so thermally noise acoustically
it's average but build quality is good
just whether that's worth it is up to
you there's a lot of really good cases
out there for a similar or cheaper price
including stuff from be quiet the dark
bass pro isn't or actually the dark
based non Pro the dark bass 900 is like
200 bucks way better options in general
but it's huge so that's obviously a
potential downside this is basically for
people who want the dark bass 900 can't
fit it for some reason but also end up
with a lower quality just kind of
acoustic and thermal level overall so
yeah overall its average that's really
all there is to it if you wanna help us
