verdict for the twenty series cards and
the twenty atti seems like the one that
makes the most sense even though it's
way too expensive for the performance
game that you get but that's not what
we're here to do what we aren't here to
do is see if we can make this thing
better maybe we can get it closer to the
performance difference the the
performance price Delta if you will by
hybridizing it so what we are going to
do is pull this thing apart again and
you can see the previous videos for why
that's annoying and put a liquid cooler
on it if we can figure that out this
will be part one where we build it up
figure out how to make a liquid cooler
fit forcibly and then we'll do a part
two where we have the thermal testing
results and see does it gain us any
meaningful performance versus the stock
card before that this video is brought
to you by EVGA SRT X 20 atti XE ultra
video card we recently used this to beat
our founders edition overclocking
results with its additional power target
headroom and cooling capabilities the XC
Ultra uses a 2.7 extra thick heatsink
for a quiet operation under low loads
but also maintains higher clocks on
average over the FP model
learn more at the link in the
description below so quick note on how
these things work then they are
thermally constrained and also
constrained by current and power
limitations the biggest constraint we
have faced is unfortunately power and
liquid cooling can't fix that but it can
stabilize the frequency and we might be
able to get it a bit higher because the
frequency temperature curve that NVIDIA
has for the 20 series is really similar
to boost 3.0 where just by dropping
temperature like a couple degrees
ambient temperature that is and feeding
the card cooler temperature putting more
fans on it we were able to get the score
and times by extreme a bit higher and
part of that is at UC temperature
frequency scaling at about 63 degrees
you see it again at something like 70
degrees heat again at 79 83 84 and then
87 and so every at least once every 10
degree increment you will see a clock
increase as you drive temperature down
we are going to see how far does that go
and at what point is it just impossible
to improve given the current limitations
and
then maybe we can try a shunt mod and
see if that helps us out by using liquid
metal to short the shunts on the card
see if Nvidia's figured out how to how
to block that venue of improving the
hardware at this time we have to go
through this again
so cart has to be disassembled for the
18th time you can see here it's getting
a little beat up now let's just go ahead
and time has speeded up one more time
any faster than last time so 3 2 1 go
okay time on that I'd be a little slower
than last time I was like 5 minutes
something but either way it's taken
apart again so now it is time to start
working on the actual hybrid part of the
mod this is not difficult at this point
and we've done it several times now but
first of all haha thank you - they're
not a sponsor for this video or anything
but we have much appreciated I fix its I
fix a pro tech toolkit for all of these
things I'm just gonna give them a shout
out because it's gotten a lot of use
from last week and the speed-up from
having that toolkit has been significant
and we'll link it below if you want to
grab one but they did they did a sponsor
our tool wall behind me so I'll just
point that out - anyway here's the card
and it is now time to get rid of the
cooler and start working on improving
everything so first thing we need to do
is figure out hole space you know which
i think is 96 millimetres 98 no oh this
is wait a minute okay I see I see so
these holes are the ones that are used
there are two sets of holes ones for the
base plate one is for the actual cooler
on the GPU officially these wider ones
are the GPU holes and that's ninety
seven and a half let's just call it 98
let's call 98 so 98 millimetres on those
and then if we went with the inner
diameter which I guess we could do that
would be 73 so need to figure out if we
have any mounting brackets that will
fit that size we have some brackets for
different coolers and these drawers and
we've used various assortments of these
for previous hybrid mods like the vega
cards we're not particularly easy we
actually for those we took one of these
actually the intel version of this
bracket and we drilled holes into it for
Vega and that was a special mod but
let's just check the whole space and on
each of these oh wow so this is a
hundred and three one hundred three
millimeters on this inner diameter of
the Intel bracket so that's not gonna
work if we cut it down to 98 I think the
AMD bracket we made might work the Vega
one no I don't know maybe that's like if
we cut a hole right next to the existing
hole we could get that to work so let's
put that as maybe these aren't great
because they're not square they're
rectangular used to be quiet one that's
a better option these are kind of
customized well these are from some deep
cool kit sometimes we could use that it
also 72-hole millimeter hole spacing
would work but we'd have to drill holes
for that too and that I think that would
be inside of the inner diameter of the
rain's that's not gonna work either okay
so let's see if the be quiet kit will
just mount on here cleanly here we have
our wall of GPUs these are all Nvidia on
the green trays and these on the yellow
trays what I'm gonna do right now is
pull just a Pascal one I can't remember
the exact hole spacing on this and check
that because that will help give me an
idea if any of my previous mods would
work on this one spacing here is 82
millimeters 81 82 for that outer
diameter so we might be able to get away
with an Arctic kit maybe or the EVGA no
I don't think the EVGA want to wear
but that's maybe AMD cards it's pull of
Vega card that's 90 so that's roughly 90
millimeters that's not we we may end up
taking the approach that we use for Vega
and custom drilling something that kind
of suck if so but I think we're gonna
try to be quiet and just see if we get
lucky because that one's got sliders
instead of screw holes so having a
slider for the screw gives us more room
to play and we have the be quiet loop up
here so I'm gonna grab that that is the
silent loop 280 can using this for
hybrid mods since we got it for the Vega
cards most recent Titan V most recently
got this and the Intel Hades Canyon one
which have to be very careful about the
mounting tension of using this because
you can start cracking the PCB if you go
too hard on it so we got to be careful
let's give this bits EVGA told us their
hybrid would be available in October so
of course we have to one-up them on
their own product and make our own first
dam that is that's very close to working
but the holes aren't quite lining up so
I'm gonna leave that thermal paste on
there for now all we're doing is just
checking contact anyway and I'm gonna
grab some more hardware screws out of
the drawer and nuts and bolts and see if
we can get this together so let's try
like some packs of these machine screws
or something I'll just note this for
anyone who doesn't already know got a
plugin of course the GN mod mat on the
table here is what we're working on this
is a product we make and sell on store
dock gamers nexus net specifically for
modding purposes for anti-static
properties but also it's just a really
cool surface with some power pin out
diagram stuff like that so I found a bag
I labeled Titan V so that's fortunate
kept those together I guess knew they'd
be coming out again so these I could get
a different different not to work with
those and it would be fine but an effort
of saving a trip to the hardware store
let's see if these will work instead
that looks good
and that looks good as well okay have to
be kind of careful with mounting this to
not apply too much force pulling on it
in one direction so we're just gonna
mount it and then pull it apart just to
see if these things even fit together
this is always fun
oh man that might work that would make
this really easy I think that's kind of
work that's the same let me check this
is the same hole spacing as the Titan V
actually so I can't remember how that
whole spaceman was that one had HBM on
it so significantly different in that
aspect but it looks like it might be the
same pretty damn close if not the same
98 nice okay cool so okay so now that we
know the whole space is the same we can
proceed with some relative confidence
and just apply the same exact mounting
hardware to this then remember this one
side was was much harder to screw in
than the others I think I went think I
want the opposite way on the Titan V but
let's just try this that's just because
of clearance issues obviously this
cooler is not meant to be used to this
particular way I don't think be quiet
officially endorses this use of their
cooler okay so it looks like this is
gonna work and now I just have to pull
the cooler back off and put thermal
paste on there because we're currently
we have the old paste on but this will
definitely fit and the cooler has
already got some course here maglev fans
on it from the Titan v mod so we're good
they're good to go in all aspects vram
this can get some coin from direct air
and videos reference PCB or VR I might
say is actually good enough that we
don't need really direct contact clean
we can just use airflow so these this
vrm will be fine even without any fins
on it and just blasting it with air will
be more than sufficient it'll be better
than the stock cooler anyway
and we took stock cooler vrm temperature
measurements we can do that again and
just see does it look like it's doing
worse than it was before and if it is we
can account for it by putting some
aluminum fins on there but I think we're
good here so at this point I'm just
gonna take this back off clean the
throttle pays to put new thermal paste
on there and then we can move forward
with with getting this thing to no
system and figuring out what we're gonna
do with it so reveal the TU 102 GPU once
again this is a 300 a model it is
factory overclocked of course because
it's a Founders edition card but we're
gonna do a lot more than the factory
we're just going to run into current
limitations I think and if I want to fix
that I guess we can try shunt mods next
but I want to go with just straight
power or started throwing will testing
first then power texts testing next if
we want to do that the shunts they're
just for reference we have one over here
on the PCB that 5mo 5 milli ohms shunt
so that's one of them and then we have
another shunt right there 5 million on
the backside or in this area on the
backside there's a third one and those
will correspond to the connectors
actually I should check I'll just check
right now and see where specifically
does each each resistor correspond with
the power connectors we're just going to
do a resistance check I think one of the
previous times I done demonstrated this
with the right idea but the wrong
practical application so I'm going to
correct that this time and show you the
right way to do it
that's the multimeter we're using then
we have I'm just gonna show you we have
a cable here with exposed wire scheme
now if we plug that in this is a 6 is
this no there's an 8 pin we can plug
this into an 8 pin power header and
you'll see that we have the black or the
ground ones up facing me and that will
correspond with these pins here so if we
look at the pin out these correspond
with the top line which again is ground
or black
and going down here and then the inner
line in here will correspond with yellow
which is 12 volt as you can see
indicated by the yellow cables so that's
your 12 volt and if we reference our GN
mod matte which again is on store
documents nexus net over here what we're
trying to do is find the twelve one of
the twelve volts and test it for
resistance versus one of the shunt
resistors and in doing so we'll learn if
those are in a direct line to each other
so we can test one of these versus the
shunt resistor and what we're looking
for is zero resistance or that they are
continuous so let's start with this one
I'm just gonna probe the top side of
this and we're going to go for the 12
volt on the inside here 0.2 for the
resistance on the on the multimeter and
just as a demonstration let's grab let's
see if these are continuous they
probably should not be but let's find
out not continuous so you'll see on the
same pin on the other connector the same
pin in terms of the pin out we're
getting numbers all over the place and
it is not continuous these are not
connected so this shunt resistor
corresponds to this particular power
header that would be the one on the Left
facing down on the card cuz when i probe
it you'll see 0.2 it's not touching
anything that's 0 L and then if we grab
something completely different you'll
see very variable resistance reported so
this one corresponds to that let's see
what this corresponds to know these are
not continuous that might correspond
with the PCIe slot is this a shunt
resistor no well we need to get rid of
that anyway that's not a shunt resistor
there's a third one on the back so for
this one continuous those are continuous
so this shunt resistor let's just double
check yes this shunt resistor core
spawns too you can see is basically zero
readout there
so let's one down here if we probe that
versus the other power header you'll see
reports back 0.1 0.2 and if we look at
again in our pinout diagram that's gonna
be a 12-volt versus the shunt resistor
so it's one of these and one of these
versus the resistor so that that is
backside corresponds to the other pin
out front side top corresponds to the
left one and then the bottom probably
goes down to the PCIe slot but we're not
going to play with those today today
we're just doing the liquid cooling
probably after that we'll look at
potential shunt mod and see if we can
lift some of the current limitations on
the card we're not really sure depends
on how strict on video wise if they put
in any intelligence in there to try and
stop us clean enough actually a little
little cleaner that's clean it off okay
so let's get some thermal paste on here
if anyone complains about too much
they're all pasted I encourage you to
watch our to much their own page video
where we prove your comments Ron
preemptively so here's the thing with
GPUs with GPUs you want too much thermal
paste because you want this to spread
and just sink in over here and the
reason for that is if there's even a
little bit of the dye exposed and builds
oh I just talked about this in his own
content because he's done it you can
kill the GPU core you kill parts that
are on there by them running too hot
versus the rest of it because there's no
guarantee it's on hold
no guarantee that the a particular piece
of circuitry you have failed to cool is
covered by over-temperature protection
it's not everything on the card is
covered by those protections so this is
a sufficient amount of thermal paste it
will spread and cover the whole die and
we have a shot I think maybe we can drop
it in where I did the too much thermal
paste that thermal grizzly car I owe
nada actually right on to an Intel CPU
and even when we did that in testing
there was no difference the only
difference is some of it gets into the
socket which kind of
when you remove the CPU but otherwise
there's no downside in terms of thermals
so all we're doing is protecting
potential lack of coverage which would
kill something to cut down now the other
reason for doing quote too much they're
all pasted on this is because I know
it's gonna be a slip and slide while I'm
trying to apply the cooler this thing is
gonna slide around a bit and so by
having extra on there it allows me some
error whereas I'm applying it and it's
sliding around because it's not meant to
be applied to this device will still
have some thermal paste in there for
sure that will make coverage between the
die and the cold plate now after doing
this I'm going to remove the thermal
pads that are on the device is still set
them aside and we are instead just gonna
blast air straight at the vrm components
and the GDD r6 you see it's kind of
moving around as I'm applying that but
because we put so much thermal paste on
there I'm confident that there will be
enough where we're not lacking coverage
in any particular spot and potentially
exposing the die to permanent damage so
we'll be good on that and then again
VRAM VRAM that'll be cooled by direct
air and direct air only so now I just
need to tighten these down we'll be done
okay so what I'm gonna do here is make
sure everything's hand tight we're not
gonna go more than that because it's
pretty easy to start bending the PCB we
really don't want to bend it it's okay
to have a little bend in there but we'd
want to relieve that stress right away
because it can cause damage to the
internal circuitry you can for example
create memory artifacting if you crack
some of the lines in there it's not
warped presently so we're good I'm just
gonna measure I get a depth gauge here
and measure how long through I've pushed
each of these screws and make sure
they're all even for even spreading of
force so that's eleven point five four
millimeters Wow nice
it was also eleven point five for this
is where we're sitting right now eleven
point five four millimeters I'm those
two
so this is just to spread the load
evenly spread the force evenly across
all four screws so that we don't have
one that strains any part of the PCB
more than the other potentially causing
it to crack this one needs to come
through a bit more I'm actually gonna
lock this at eleven point five four so
those are all even now I'm just gonna
look at the board and see if there's any
warping of the PCB so I would say that
there's no meaningful warping of the PCB
going on the straight edge just lines up
with it so there's our hybrid Mahad way
easier than the previous ones we've done
with Vega Fe Titan V some of the others
even but still the EVGA old GPU CLC's do
not fit on this which is unfortunate
because we like working with them
they're much easier to use but we got to
be quiet one on here at the CLC 280 it's
what we use for the Titan V same whole
space and I think as a Titan V and we've
got two maglev fans on it the course
here ml 140 s and then we're just going
to remove the thermal pads and blast the
thing with a lot of air from top down
and from the front it'll be fine it'll
be better probably GPU thermal or vrm
thermals then the other the efi version
of the card with this big thing on it so
we'll see how it does I don't know like
the temperature will definitely better
that's that much is clear for sure the
thermals will be better it's it just
becomes a question of do those really
get us anything for clocks does it get
us any performance and it should but it
might be single digit percentages I
don't know it's it's gonna come down to
how hard is this is this board current
limited versus on the previous models
and if we run out of any room whatever
to do any what so ever do anything with
we might just go ahead and try a shunt
mod so check back for that as always
subscribe for more this is part 1 part 2
we'll have the results need to do a lot
of testing on it it'll take a think
about a day or so so check back for that
