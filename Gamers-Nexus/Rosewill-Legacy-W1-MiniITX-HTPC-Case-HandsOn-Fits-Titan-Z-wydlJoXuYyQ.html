Nexus tonight and we are here at PAX
East 2014 and this is day two I think
it's been quite a long day I am here at
Rose Wells secret room in the side we
have a legacy W one case this is a brand
new case they're showing off here at PAX
East so this is a mini ITX form-factor
case you can check probably the sidebar
they're a couple reviews we've done
recently of other mini ITX cases so it
is sort of a trend right now after CES
we have like I said mini ITX it mounts
down here and because it's horizontal
like this we have full room for
basically any air cooler that you would
want for a mini ITX system the video
card goes here we have two expansion
slots and it will fit up to a Titan Z so
basically anything you could care about
if you've got $3,000 for a Titan Z I
could use one let me know I promise I
will get it back to you cool in it comes
stock with two 140 millimeter fans
there's one on the front one in the back
and in the top you can mount liquid you
can mount liquid cooling radiator so to
4280 stuff like that drive bays we have
four 3.5 inch hard drive slots we have a
slim optical drive slot and two 2.5 inch
slots for SSDs in terms of the power
supply I will show off the Hercules
power supply that Rosewell has which
I've been told fits in this
compartmentalized power supply's slot so
pretty impressive once again if you need
a Hercules and a Titan Z in this case
more power to you I guess but the point
is you can fit any power supply in here
we have a pretty standard dust filter in
the bottom for the PSU there's dust
filter in the top that is not removable
so you just pop this off and then you
can run it under water so everything is
toolless it's aluminum shell on the
outside steel frame I asked the gotcha
question about if the aluminum would die
from the steel frame but they've
actually thought of that and have
padding here and then plastic mounts for
the actual mount joists so everything
looks pretty good we will get back to
you on full reviews if we end up doing
one link in the description below for
all details and I will see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
