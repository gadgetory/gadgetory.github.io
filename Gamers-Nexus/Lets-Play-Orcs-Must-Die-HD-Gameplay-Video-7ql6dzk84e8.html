done that we're going to play orcs must
die by robot entertainment AKA ballers
because they a lot of them came from
ensemble studios makers of age of
empires three and you know they have
some skilled people over there this game
is really simple it is based entirely if
you had not guessed on killing orcs and
we all know orcs are the worst things
you could ever face in life as a fantasy
character so with that in mind we're
going to kill some works it's
essentially and add to marry core it's a
tower defense game except you play in
third person as a standard fantasy
character and our character is an archer
in this case you can get different
here's our spell if you can get a staff
you can get different upgrades as well
like this wind belt and while my guy is
still talking in the background I wish
he would shut his mouth anyway tower
defense game they come in through the
door that would be this big thing that
resembles a door if you had not figured
that out so they come in through the
door follow this shiny blue line and it
looks like they're actually going to
split two directions which makes it way
cooler because that's a lot more
complexity right there okay i just had
to double check right here because
earlier when i did my first recording
which failed due to lag issues i decided
to jump in a pit of acid to see if it
would kill me and spoiler alert it did
so don't do that it's bad for your
health as stated they're going to come
through these two lines I need to stop
them from coming in here and entering my
rift which is this thing the beautiful
rift and apparently they shouldn't go
through here because it leads to I don't
know it leads to wall street or
something and we don't want them to go
in there so we have some money we're
going to lay down some traps we're going
to kill it works and that's the core of
the game let's
so my trap book right here or spell book
we have a few different options I just
unlock these wild blades so I really
want to try them let's get those down
here spike trap is your basic trap it
shoots spikes from the floor if you head
and figure that out from the picture tar
trap will slow things down so we're
going to use tar traps and you can use
these in conjunction with other traps
like arrow walls so you slow them down
and then you blast them with arrows
repeatedly and that is just the basic
strategy in this game not super complex
but it's still really cool and works
well together spring traps in addition
to the other traps I've just mentioned
will launch orcs over ledges and into
acid pits or generally their death if
you want to make it basic we also have
Archer guardians which our NPCs and they
can be killed but they're still really
good we're going to get some of those I
have upgraded you see these shields on
these two traps that means i upgraded
them so they're cheaper and well in this
case cheaper and more cost effective so
we can use barricades which essentially
force them through a certain pathway so
you can sort of amazed you're your lanes
will call them in in your castle and
force them through certain areas so very
basic very similar to most tower defense
games even though if I'm starcraft for
our final item let's go with it's nice
to have these cheap ones as sort of your
baseline I kind of like the spring traps
but let's close this for a second and
see if there's a good spot for a spring
trap launch I do not see you can spot
down here and I'm not entirely sure
because I haven't done it yet if
launching them off of this what down
there will kill them I assume it does
but again not entirely sure so I think
I'm going to skip the spring trap on
this level and go with something
probably more basic let's go with the
actually I will get the spring trap and
i'll tell you why i can use it to launch
them into wall blades which will be
awesome a not sure really cost effective
but hey it'll be cool so that's all i'd
say about that i'm not sure which door
they come through first seems to vary
but we have enough money to put some
traps down in each hallway i'm going to
try to combine my traps so that they get
the best spread between both entrances
possible looks like they're coming up
those stairs oops that would seem kind
of those stairs and entering over here
so they are are they gone this way they
are going that way I'm not going to be
able to do it I wanted let's put this
here put at our trap and front of it but
to just to make sure they're slow that
will riddle them with arrows we can put
some wall blades uh where should we put
the wall blades guys kind of I think
they'd make a good last defense as well
I want to do some wall blades over here
and basically just channel them into
them by using the barricades I talked
about earlier so barricades first I'm
not gonna have enough money for it
that's one of the things you faced in
this game you have to figure out what's
going to most cost effective
unfortunately archers can be killed so
I'm not going to put them up there I
will be able to put them down here
though without being in line of the
force other than or archers so let's put
an archer back here a little bit that
way he has some cover because we all
know NPCs are fantastic at taking cover
just kidding they're really not but you
probably
we need a little bit more setup and then
we can go let's do spring-trap here like
that and I'm out of money so I can do
one more tart RAB somewhere to get ready
for another but at our trap right here
that way I can do an arrow trap in that
wall in a minute let's start this way
with the G button looks like they are in
fact coming through this way now you
gain skulls that's your objective gets
goals oh and I need to say that words oh
they were coming to both ways and that
did work btdubs they died when they fell
down there because that is a really far
fall and apparently falling that far is
not good for your help I have a whore's
coming at me right now and oh man
they're pretty easy to kill with this
machine gun crossbow which we all know
is totally realistic by the way they had
these just ask I don't know ask
Wikipedia it will tell you they have
them because I will edit it to tell you
they have them in medieval times so what
I just did there was accidentally shoot
down a chandelier you can shoot down
prefab objects like that and it will
damage the orcs so pretty cool stuff
there it gives you some extra extra
strategy you can use them and hard times
as i was saying a minute ago you want to
kill porks as fast as possible to get
many skulls as possible and the skulls
will give you different upgrades
upgrades of course make your traps of
better so more skulls better traps more
efficient at killing and it's just a
self-feeding cycle and from that I think
the top right you'll see the number of
wrist points I have as Oryx can pass me
and run into the riff they will diminish
my wrist points which means i will
receive fewer skulls which means fewer
upgrades and again self-perpetuating
cycle of suck which is not a good cycle
to be an FYI it has happened before in
several recordings that are never going
on youtube that is not to say actually
yeah it is to say they are never going
on
because they were horrible looks like
man guys this I'm so glad if at this
level up is the most interesting one so
far make sense because as you get
further in the game they get more
interesting I should probably put traps
down there to try and kill or faster
again to get more skulls faster so here
they come up the stairs and blasting off
arcane bolts and left and right here I
feel like I'm playing an arcane archer
and D&amp;amp;D 3.5 or something if you get that
reference please like this video because
you know how awesome they are oh so
other than force which are really basic
and we all know that its way through
that then again really basically all
know it orcs are besides them there are
ogres which are super hard to kill and
if they get through it costs you 5 rift
points out of the current 25 so that is
pretty devastating I can I'm going to
put this here to force them through
those blades and I'm going to put this
here to slow them down in the blades so
there is some combo in for you right
there unfortunately there's not a while
to put this on so that I can shoot them
on there that as well Oh actually there
is JK put it right there that is a
pretty devastating trap let's start this
wave so as I was saying ogres big and
hard to kill there are also Co walls
which will run past wow those horrible
just pretend i didn't shoe right there
that will run past all of your traps or
almost all of them and different traps
better on different enemies so kobold
you're going to want to use slowing
traps because they are stupidly fast
they are basically like I don't even
know what they like they are like ghosts
from the original Halo or something they
just run through there but we need to
see this thing working right here like
death trap of death unfortunately looks
like it already death they're going to
the death so we can't see it there we go
ball to make it through fast they go
straight for the rift and try and ruin
your day orcs like these
are just trying to get to the end of the
level they're very basic the top right
you can see if I let any through by
looking at red dots they just look there
to see where the enemies are currently
they are all dead if you didn't notice
and what else we got we got archers you
saw a couple of those archers are pretty
good the bad thing about them is they
can shoot my archers so I don't like
them that much but then again I don't
like orcs that much in general because
they smell let's put some more archers
down and this is just going to be my
attempt to kill these guys ever faster
see where we can put another trap down
here I want to do one of these here
somewhere but I'm afraid it's not gonna
I'm afraid it's gonna be too high to
actually hit them and out of sight guys
this oh day and I was not paying a
dungeon where is he coming from thirties
we have Oryx coming in from all three
directions oh my gosh I'm going to lose
some points on this one this is not good
from me we need an archer go Archer go
Archer he's probably going to die but it
was for a good cause keep going here
pork archers are now coming from the
left side and they are they as I said
earlier they are capable of killing my
archers so keep that in mind
try and stop as many as possible we were
really down to 70 North points and still
falling 16 see if I can stop this last
guy so that was pretty harsh around
because I was trying to block the bottom
part so let's see if we can I think most
of them got through here so try and make
this area more effective and this one I
think this one's pretty good as is so
this time I'm going to focus over here
and see if I can make sure that could
not happen again it does I have no
chance if you look at the top right you
can see I have six out of nine waves
currently complete so in other three
waves and this level is over and we move
on to the next and unlock new traps or
spells because there is a spell book and
you can get things like firewall as seen
in the trailers so right now we have
some guys making it pass over here man
this is a challenging level I'll tell
you that let's do another arrow trap try
and save myself some effort there holy
crap those wall blades are killer they
just killed like six or sat at a time
apparently any more of those try and
stop these yeah so the problem with
these traps that he hadn't noticed when
you overlap them if they synchronize
properly they will all trigger at
different times that's killing a wider
spread of Orcs however if they trigger
simultaneously which it looks like they
are kind of doing it will just kill one
or many times over so you know one or
will be hit by these arrows and that
thing right there and that's just
overkill and wasting efficiency but I'm
hoping they're working properly I'm
going to do a barricade here to force
them on to that and can't do any arrow
traps here unfortunately but I might
might be tempted to put more archers
down somewhere like at the end of these
hallways they're normally pretty good
way down here for example he should be
able to i don't know what the range is
exactly but he should be able to shoot
almost all the way down there do another
like I still alive hey B what's going on
do another one all the way down here
just in case any leak through this way
and I feel like I'm playing starcraft
one right now except in third person and
it's not starcraft i'm going to start
this round and let's see probably do
another i want to do another barricade
right there but i don't know if it's
going to cost effective let's go for
some arrow traps somewhere do some
aircraft want to sit down here but i
don't think they're really come through
that way okay just
they are oh man football's that is not
going to give to me so as stated earlier
co balls are stupidly fast good thing
those wall traps are just slicing on the
ribbons except for that guy who decided
to be a baller and run right past it I
do have a week like crazy on the right
side despite my traps co well it's
trying to get through the left they are
blanking everywhere huge leak on the
right side again need to get over here
to stop this good thin I have my trust
oh my G that's an ogre FYI and I can't
really focus on them right now oh I have
to focus on because that's going to suck
up against it I think they will chase me
though so I can just run him over traps
repeatedly and that will kill them
faster so basically you're going to want
to kite these guys around the level once
you get there ouch attention ouch and
you can kitem over traps notice i took
some damage there to heal i can go to
the rift that will actually heal me got
a coin which gives me more money so we
can go here and I he'll just like that
man only have 10 wrist points now this
is going to be a sucky round I would
probably only get a few skulls but it
shows off the game pretty well running
really this is going to be a tough one I
need to do more of these I'm going to do
it right here even though i don't think
i need one there but i probably will use
it regardless these co balls are going
to ruin
Wow look at all those words you guys
just need to kill everything as fast as
possible and not lose that's the
objective here archers are super
effective against orcs it is like
pokemon fire pokemon like I don't know
what charizard against squirtle or
something because that Archer is
squirtle and these it works are
Charizard except not be really because
that's an old reference we got some more
leak over here on the rush back over
here with sprint which as in most games
is shift that ogre is about to destroy
that poor Archer hopefully I keep them
alive but I had better things to worry
about right now like I'm not losing oh I
was close right there damn one got
through with the ogre go oh my gosh the
ogre get through why did you guys tell
me why that what's wrong with you too
bad looks like the earlier go through
that is a horrible horrible level I'm
down to five I have not been that low I
will probably only get one skull if that
which is basically currency I don't know
if I ever finish that sentence because i
know i was trying through for about a
year and i kept getting distracted
skulls are basically currency so you
want a lot of them to be able to
actually get upgrades and you know be
better in the game since i'm not doing
amazing i will not get a nice boat but
this is a really cool level and all that
indicates to me is that unlike the first
few levels that were slow the game does
indeed pick up and speed and that's what
we were worried about at least that's
what i was worried that and looks like
my worries were
okay I was focusing on I could hold on
it looks like my worries are not
actually founded and much other than the
first 15 minutes of the game were not
incredibly challenging or mentally
taxing but this area is definitely
definitely the game I wanted to play so
I'm really have you see this fortunately
unfortunately rather my archers dead
that's kind of mean to say unfortunately
I guess so I am having to do all the
work here when I put some more down here
that way I get extra help because I'm
not going to kill these on my own oh man
not think about the middle there and
ogre now one made it through
if that guy makes it through I lose so I
need to just take them down a minute to
make sure he doesn't try and run through
there you can right-click the stun them
that's what I'm doing head shots do more
damage i believe and just like any other
game your reticle will sort of there we
go reticle will expand as you shoot more
so you gotta shoot slower for those
headshots I'm sure someone can do math
on whether it's worth it I actually got
two skulls on that one not too bad at
all actually I was expecting one but we
look at exactly why I got that many so I
lost I have 21 hours to find slots that
is horrible but I'm happy to see that
the game is advancing hen hey you know I
was distracting the whole time and it's
all your fault so that's what I have to
say with that finished under par at 1239
part is 13 so that gave me a bonus skull
your max is 5 that you can get shows us
our kills and all that crap let's go
back and we can look at upgrades I only
have four skulls so I can't afford any
of these upgrades and basically when you
can't afford them like this one it'll
deal more damage damage damage it'll
deal more damage guys do more damage
because there's steel wall blades you
can get Archer champions which are
better archers obviously I already got
the extended arrow wall which shoots
farther and then we have you can get you
know stick your tar traps and poison
spikes and all that crap so that is orcs
must die I will do more videos as I keep
playing this game because I am pretty
happy with it I've been looking forward
to it since packs or be four packs even
so very happy to see it coming out it
will be released on steam for pc and
other digital distribution methods i
