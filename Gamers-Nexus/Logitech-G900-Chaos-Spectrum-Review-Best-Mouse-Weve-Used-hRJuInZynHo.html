mouse it makes great engineering efforts
to dismantle this argument that wireless
mice are somehow unreliable for gaming
or have slower input latency ISM this
argument does come from reality but it
doesn't always have to be the case and
that's what Logitech is trying to prove
with its new G 900 that were reviewing
today so we have a full in-depth review
on this which will talk about the radio
frequency interference impedance talk
about crosstalk talk about the battery
life the mechanics of the mouse and the
click enos I mean I don't know if you
can hear that but it's pretty clicky and
we'll be talking about overall value for
gamers so let's just dive into this
immediately we've got to talk specs
before getting to all the in-depth
testing reviewing Logitech's chaos
spectrum G 900 is a little bit like
reviewing a supercar it's a $150 Mouse
and just to sort of spoil the review is
straight away it is exceptionally well
engineered but it's expensive it's
targeted it has specific use cases and
at the cost of an entry level video card
it's instantly out of budget for people
shopping for maybe a $50 Mouse even in
such an instance that this is out of
your budget the G 900 is a peripheral
worth paying attention to and that's
because it's worth learning about and
studying because some of the mouse's key
features will invariably bleed over into
new products in the future and hopefully
those will be lower cost a lot of types
of boasting approximately a 24-hour run
to die battery life and that means
constant non-stop use which is not the
same as everyday use and shoots for over
30 hours with the RGB LEDs disabled a
720 milliamp hour 15 gram lithium
polymer battery is used for the G 900
allowing for an ultra lightweight build
and a near constant voltage depression
curve throughout the batteries a charge
cycle you can learn more about batteries
like this in our previous battery video
lipo batteries are deformable almost
liquid like versions of lithium ion
meaning that the G 900 internal battery
can be shaped into form to fit a
uniquely small compartment while still
extracting long life this isn't unique
to the G 900 it exists in many
applications but for comparison the
razor Mamba uses an 1,800 milliamp hour
battery that weighs 31 grams so it's
heavier and has approximately a 20-hour
run to die charge cycle less endurance
weighs more and more milliamp hours for
other specs the Gina
tracts in excess of 300 inches per
second which is faster than even pro
gamers can reasonably twitch and has a
two hundred twelve thousand dpi high
resolution sensor and that of course
means a lot more than just the dots per
inch because that is kind of pointless
at twelve thousand it's got small
incremental stepping in that sensor
range
the buttons are rated for twenty million
clicks the tetrafluoroethylene
feet are rated for two hundred and fifty
kilometers of movement and acceleration
is rated for upwards of forty g buttons
are modular allowing for completely
ambidextrous configurations with six to
eleven total programmable buttons
depending on how you configure the
button layout and that includes
logitech's hyper fast scroll wheel the
buttons are programmable through LGS the
new metal spring tensioning system is
also present offering a resolute and
consistent click force that feels
analogous to the transition from a
membrane keyboard to a mechanical
keyboard still it's no m6 3mm mechanical
ball mouse so that's all the brochure
knowledge to talk about Pohl rates and
frequency and interference we have to do
some more in-depth testing or at least
analysis of testing provided to us
because some of this requires some
high-end equipment that we don't have
like anechoic chambers but we did do a
lot of the testing and validation on our
own where we were able to one of those
very easy tests was bringing the G 900
to PAX East which we recently went to
and PAX East if you saw our content had
upwards of 15 the 20,000 concurrent
visitors at any one time on Saturday
that is a lot of people with a lot of
phones a lot of computers in b-y-o-see
more than 500 systems in the PC free
play area tons of interference potential
we tested this there on the floor with
our editing laptop and had no issues at
all with tracking it was consistent
there was no teleportation of the cursor
from one corner to the other and so
performance was pretty good overall we
also stopped by Logitech booth and
looked at some of the testing that they
had available and even got to click
around on the mice ourselves to look
more in depth at how the input and
things like that respond traditional
wireless mice are engineered for an 8
millisecond response time as mechanism
for battery life preservation a slower
clock oscillation results in reductions
to input responsiveness that the user
can perceive especially in gaming so for
gamers milliseconds matter high-end
wireless mice for gaming primarily
differ
shave themselves in the polling rate and
logitech's G 911 report rate that makes
a data transmission to the wireless
receiver effectively instant mice
boasting a 1,000 Hertz poll rate would
also have a 1 millisecond report rate
just for clarity and that's 1000 Hertz
which means 1000 times per seconds
that's a thousand reports per second law
detects wire g-series mice like the g502
proteus core that we praised previously
respond approximately 1.2 milliseconds
faster than the g 900 so there is a
difference and it is measurable 1.2
milliseconds in response but that's more
or less imperceptible by the user
actually it's effectively completely
imperceptible to the user and the
response times are fairly tight
Elliott's variable overall and that's
true for basically all mice this
histogram from PACs shows a bell curve
of response times from click input the G
900 exhibited an input latency range of
3.4 2 milliseconds or a 3.2 5
millisecond minimum 26.67 millisecond
maximum with an average of 5.07 the
razer Mouse present for testing just for
example had a range of 3.1 to
milliseconds that's the range of input
with a nine point three one millisecond
minimum to twelve point four three
millisecond maximum averaged at 11.81
milliseconds that makes the G 900
objectively faster in input measurement
by a few times actually and still
consistently tightly timed within the
range of results and then there's the
whole Wireless interference argument and
there's a lot that goes into this test
and we have actually about a thousand
words dedicated just to this in the
article linked in the description below
click on that if you want to learn about
this stuff but we'll go through the
basics and the most important elements
here so we've talked about input latency
but there's another aspect of
performance I want to talk up first and
that's impedance this is less about
input latency and more about overall
signal strength of the mouse which is
indicative of its ability to perform in
perhaps conventional or land
environments a market that Logitech is
targeting with this Mouse in a perfect
world with no interference and flawless
components one which would never exist a
wireless mouse should track a perfectly
circular radiation pattern when spun
about its access for example on a
turntable but the G 900 isn't perfect
and neither is any other Mouse for that
matter it does however output eight
decimal milliwatts of max
power with a fairly circular radiation
pattern it's consistent in its tracking
and the next closest competitor is
SteelSeries with their sensei wireless
mouse tracking at negative one decibel
milliwatts and outputting a fairly
reliable pattern comparable to the G 900
razors Ouroboros tracked at negative 12
decibel milliwatts and was a bit more
erratic in its behavior as shown most
heavily in this anechoic chamber testing
data that we obtained through Logitech
in these tests the mouse was placed 50
inches from the receiver and tracked
with frequencies in Bluetooth class to a
c LD m5 mode 802 dot 11 G and Wireless
channels 1 through 13 and Gaussian
frequency shift keying modulation
sweeping between two point four zero
zero gigahertz and two point four eight
three gigahertz executed in one
megahertz increments that is a lot of
frequency Mumbai earning this mouse at
once and all the other tested mice and
the mouse was even jogged in a fixed
pattern throughout the tests to show a
circular drift pattern on the far left
which is your what you're looking at now
this is the wired mouse on the far left
it has a wire followed by a similar
pattern in the centre but for the G 900
wireless mouse this is without the wire
connected and no frequency interference
or perturbation going on
finally the far right image is the G 900
with an onslaught of noise and impedance
and the pattern is slightly disturbed
but effectively identical even in its
worst case scenario the mouse never
jumps or skips and it's tracking and
this is something we have independently
validated and even tested in real-world
intense environments like the middle of
PAX East that's the big thing to look
for if the cursor tracking suddenly
teleports across the screen which I'm
sure many of you have seen in your game
and experience that's a major issue that
means you can't trust that thing for
gaming and we have not seen that issue
with this mouse that did however happen
with some of the competing products like
SteelSeries sensei wireless mouse that
exhibits loops rather than circles
result of RF interference and you can
see a couple of the other ones here as
well but enough of that aspect for now
the rest is in the article let's talk
about the clicky nests and mechanics of
this mouse of course a very important
aspect to any Gaming Mouse the
colliculus is resolute and definitive it
is very satisfying actually in an odd
way kind of like mechanical keyboards
when you move from
membranes mechanical and it's got a very
consistent off the line actuation for us
as well so from our mouse to one that
some other reviewer may have the force
should be pretty consistent it's got
about a 10 gram force range between the
off-the-line products and the actuation
force required to do one of these is 55
to 65 grand force so you can check some
of the other measurements online to
compare that to your mouse so you can
kind of understand where it compares
against what you're using today logitech
uses a spring to preload the switch
under the key plate which rocks on the
fulcrum toward the center of the mouse
this is indicated by the yellow circle
in this image and the switch is mounted
at an angle consistent with the
depression of the key plates eliminating
shear force and making for the
consistency and durability experience
with the G 900 overall I'm very happy
with the click enos and mechanics of the
mouse it feels perfect to use quite
frankly for gaming
I like the G 303 a lot previously if
you're familiar with that one or the G
502 but this has a bit of a different
feel to it and some of that is of course
use bias one other item to note here of
course is that there is a very tiny bit
of latency in one aspect of this mouse
and it's not that important and that is
when it wakes up so when you turn this
thing on you'll see I've got the LEDs
perhaps you can see that and if I leave
it here sitting don't use it for 10
minutes it will go to sleep now of
course when you move it it takes it out
on I'll on maybe half a second or less
to wake back up so there should be an
expectation of a very slight delay there
but that's never going to happen in
gaming because there's never a time when
you're just going to leave that there
hands off for 10 minutes while you're
playing Counter Strike unless you're
insanely good so that is not really a
concern but it is something I wanted to
note of course just for realistic
expectations of the mouse and it does
have I'm not exactly sure how this works
to be honest but it does have some sort
of micro sleep in it as well so if you
are if you move to the side and just
type for a bit and then come back to the
mouse it there's no latency or anything
that hasn't officially gone to sleep but
it is preserving power just by nature of
not using the controller it's got a
32-bit arm CPU in here it's not going to
be hammering the sensor or doing any
tracking or things like that when it's
sitting still so of course that does
preserve power which means this 24 hour
run to die life that we talked about
earlier is basically if you were to
sit down and play games for 24 hours
from now non-stop that's how long it
would last in real-world use and my
personal use for office and gaming
environments I've gotten about four to
maybe five days out of it and that's
just kind of leaving it on turn it off
when I walk away things like that one
additional note here the mouse is
phenomenally light to the point that
everyone who picked it up commented on
it and weighs about 100 grams that's
less than many wired mice even and is
important for this because a battery is
normally heavy its mechanics feel
satisfying and well engineered Logitech
SCAF spectrum G 900 for these reasons
and the other is defined here in gets
our editors a choice and build quality
Awards or here your execution of design
and engineering and this has now D
throned previous Logitech mice as the
quote best mouse I've ever used and that
proves I think in my book that Wireless
mice can actually be better than wired
mice for gaming and Logitech in this
regard has definitively proven its point
that it's set out to make with the G 900
so this is a $150 Mouse just to set a
few other options out there if it's too
much for $75 you can get the g502
proteus core which we did like pretty
well but it's wired you can also and
should look at the brand new Corsair M
65 wired mouse that's about $60 it's an
M 65 pro that's the name of an M 65 pro
we're working on reviewing that one the
logitech g502 proteus core would be the
sort of direct option against that Mouse
75 or $60 and then finally if you want a
wireless mouse I would suggest looking
at the SteelSeries sensei Wireless which
is 133 issue dollars so it's a bit
cheaper than this but it's got some
differences of course and its overall
layout and you need to take those into
account if you want a smaller Mouse
though it's worth looking at certainly
so those are the main options I would
point you toward we've also used the
Razer Ouroboros and I am not personally
a big fan of that Mouse it's well we'll
talk about that in the future but the
ones I just laid out are the ones I
would look at most immediately so as
