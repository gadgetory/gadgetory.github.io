build for a community member of ours on
the patreon discord zbg zeg does 3d
modeling placement things like that with
a software called Daz 3d works with a
couple of other tools as well all he
ever does is post on patreon discord
complaining about how his system is
taking days to render a scene and about
CPU thread limitations and about cuda
limitations so we've worked with the
community on the GN discord to put
together a system for zeg and fixes
problems before that this is brought to
you by the EVGA 240 CLC which is a $120
MSRP closed-loop liquid cooler the EVGA
240 CLC has an RGB illuminated pomp
plate uses a thermal probe within the
lower pump chamber for liquid
temperature monitoring and allows
customization through software learn
more at the link in the description
below this is the result of the build
which was in part one we've got a rise
in seven 1,700 system the CPU was
purchased by the community I got a board
from gigabyte it's a gaming 5x 370 board
actually encountered some trouble we'll
talk about in a moment the community
bought a gtx 1070 used and that's a
gaming X card they got some RAM I picked
up the case the power supply we got some
other components in here as well so this
is gonna be the benchmark results of the
build as a whole how it came together
and how it works so the problems we
encountered basically I put it together
on camera as you all saw and then I gave
it to Patrick to do benchmarks we did
gaming benchmarks power consumption
things like that as normally
unfortunately his entire first day was
so washed so he spent the whole day at
running all the benchmarks on it and
then we realized that there were
problems with stability and with memory
frequency and that the frequency
wouldn't hold with the XMP enabled so it
would be stuck to whatever stock was 21
33 or something and also we started
getting spurious crashes at one point
which was really frustrating because of
course we're thinking well maybe it's
just our image is no good nope what
actually happened was after
troubleshooting every single thing and
memory all this stuff fortunately we
have a whole shelf full of components
troubleshot all of it and it came down
to not the motherboard but the
motherboard socket the CPU socket so
I've never had this problem before
basically the board that was sent out
was just I guess a one-off defect or
maybe a used review sample or something
like that write it off as a normal
non-issue because we have three of these
boards and all of them have been fine
but this one that we got and used in
this build the first time it was ever
used socket of the CPU and the latch for
the amp or latch those of you who have
used it will know that it kind of has
like a point where you can feel more
pressure applied and it locks into place
well this one didn't really do that and
I kind of noticed it during the build
process but I didn't really think much
of it I just kind of thought oh well
that was an easier one than normally but
what actually happened was that socket
is on the board loose so it's loose
enough that the pads weren't making full
contact to the pins on the CPU because
there was a little bit of sort of z
space between them so without full
contact depending on how tight the CPU
cooler was basically that dictated the
stability of the system system the
stability and the performance of the
system was not based on component specs
it was based on how its height where the
screws holding down the CPU for the CPU
cooler so yeah that was a problem we had
the unbuild it all replace the board
it's good now I put one of our review
boards in there
technically Patrick did it but we put a
review board in there and that one's
definitely good to go so solve the
problem gigabytes gonna take the other
one back and replace it no big deal but
definitely a weird first time issue for
the the socket retention and retested
everything twice due to the memory
instability issues so that's two full
days of tests it's good to go now so
let's go through some of the blender
results first cuz CDG does basically all
rendering that's gonna the most
interesting to him and then these will
be derived from our recent 1700
benchmarks then we'll have game
benchmarks and power benchmark
specific to this system so for blender
we've previously run several blender
rendering workloads on the r7 1700 CPU
as shown in some of these charts from
our i5 8400 cpu review we have charts
for the monkey heads render the splash
image and then the GM logo image all
these were either made in-house or
modified in-house and represent a pretty
realistic use case for someone like zdg
who does this kind of thing all the time
the r7 1700 is the best in terms of
performance per dollar and overclocking
pushes that further we've actually pre
overclocked zdg system to a stable 3.9
gigahertz though you could do 4.00 with
some extra voltage but we'll leave that
up to him to decide if he wants to do
that for 24/7 use he's probably capable
of that anyway for renders it doesn't
get much better in terms of efficacy at
the dollar the gtx 1070 will enable cuda
acceleration for his more specialized
applications which we didn't test but
it's there if it's ever needed for 1080p
gaming we found CDG's build ran total
war Warhammer at around 115 FPS average
with a lows at 70 and 60fps 0.1% the
build did ok with project cars measuring
an 80 FPS average with lows around the
60s and watchdogs 2 also did just fine
marking a 92 FPS average frame rate with
lows at 58 and 74 it's not the best
frame rate you could get but for someone
who's primarily going to use the machine
for CPU bound rendered tasks and some
CUDA workloads it's doing just fine for
the occasional game 1440p reduces FPS a
bit as we become clearly more bound by
the gtx 1070 than by the 1700 CPU frame
rate falls from 115 to 96 FPS average
and Total War still perfectly acceptable
with lows around where they were
previously project cars also drops to 70
FPS so it's falling 10 and watchdog's
two drops hard from 92 to 66 FPS average
but still remains perfectly playable as
for power consumption we're looking at
total system power consumption at the
wall rather than EPS 12-volt consumption
because this is a complete system build
so that's what matters the stock non
overclocked configuration drive 68 watts
idle with the high-performance windows
profile enabled and we are at 145 watts
and Cinebench multi-threaded workloads
90 watt single threaded
144 and blender which was the most
important metric to know we also have
261 watt draw in a gaming scenario with
total war at Warhammer overclocking
obviously increases those numbers with
blender now drawing 190 watts at the
wall
total war drawing 270 and Cinebench up
to 198 so that's the build this is it's
pretty good system actually like I said
in the beginning I asked for this case
from silverstone because i liked this
case and i know for someone like ZD g
he's gonna like it cuz he's got two
needs which are ventilation ZD G's big
on functionality not in a silly form and
then also dust filtration just because
honestly I've seen some of his pictures
he's uploaded to discord of older
systems and I think it'll help out to
have so this case is good for that it's
the same one we use in our render
machine just black instead of white
cooling is no problem at all and then
for the CPU cooler we have it on the top
it's a 240 EVGA cooler and it's pushing
it up and out which seems to be working
pretty well and then the the 1070 is not
too affected by the power supply shroud
in the bottom just because the case is
taller so it provides a good maybe 4 to
5 inches of space between the card and
the shroud which is enough for it to
breathe so everything came together well
performance is good clearly a good
rendering machine good animation type of
machine on a budget because with the gtx
1070 in there you're gonna do fine and
most cuda accelerated tasks that are not
like pro daily driver professional user
type of rendering and then the cpu can
handle all of his CPU tasks so that's it
for this one if you want to join the
patreon discord where all of this was
planned and a secret from zdg you go to
patreon.com slash gamers nexus or you
can just subscribe for more as always
and go to store that gamers nexus dotnet
for shirts and things like this i'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
