computex 2016 now and we're looking at a
new version or the 1080 this is the
strict model to 1080 so you've already
seen the Twin Frozr one from MSI you've
seen the founders edition this is thus
tricks and before getting to that all
this coverage is brought to you by a
messiah in the new x99 a broad well II
motherboards so jumping into this thing
first of all it's gone eight plus two
vrm power phase setup so the phase
design should hopefully be a bit better
for overclocking especially with regard
to memory which we ran some limitations
with the 1080 founders edition so 8 plus
2 vrm phases in terms of other custom
aspects the PCB is a custom PCB it is
non-reference which is a good thing the
power setup it's the normal 8-pin plus a
6-pin so it's 8 plus 6 that adds an
extra 75 watts of power puts you
probably in the range of 250 to 300
watts total available draw of course
then your limitation becomes voltage so
for voltage we've asked and it does have
a custom v bios i am not sure if that
allows extra over voltage in terms of
the millivolt amount exactly we don't
know but it does have a custom v bio so
hopefully it allow some extra over
voltage so extra 6 pin costumey bios
custom PCB it's got a back plate with
leds in it that's the part of their
Aurora RGB LEDs and then there's more
RGB LEDs here on the card the top and
the bottom and that pretty much sums up
the basics of the card in terms of
cooling it's got a triple fan setup part
of their strict model and it does as
with all the Strix cards spin down to 0
RPM when there's low load or low
temperature the heat pipes on the card
are eight millimeter pipes there's a
couple of them I did not count but you
can see a couple heat pipes running
through the system frickin massive
aluminum heatsink on top of the GPU and
over here on top of the vrm the vram
modules are somewhere in this area which
are of course also covered by the alloy
heatsink so that covers the card in
terms of what the card is in this is if
you are not familiar the XG station to
which is an external graphics enclosure
for laptops it's hooked up it's one of
the asus rog laptops behind it over here
and that's all communicating through the
fund the thunderbolts protocol so that
that's pretty much what we've got for
you at the AC
booth at computex 2016 links in the
description below for more information
and check out our other computex
coverage including the msi twin frozer
coverage because that was the first one
we looked at and we'll be looking at PNY
and other vendors in the immediate
future so thank you for watching
patriotic special video I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
