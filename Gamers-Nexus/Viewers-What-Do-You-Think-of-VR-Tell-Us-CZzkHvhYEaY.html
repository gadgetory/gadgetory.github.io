one-on-one video with the viewers to pay
attention here we've gotten this
question from a few manufacturers here
at computex 2016 and the question is
what do your viewers think of virtual
reality so before that all this coverage
brought to you by rosewill and their new
cullinan case with tempered glass side
paneling so V are a few things I want to
know here for our own coverage for what
we're reporting to you all and for the
manufacturers who view this video just
out of their own market research and
curiosity one is we are interesting to
you at all do you care about it at all
too in what regard do you care about VR
if you do and if you don't then why not
so very easy example here yes I care
about VR I care about it because I want
to play games or I care about it because
I want showroom demos of cars whatever
house is what a real estate all that
kind of stuff so those are some examples
and then the third main question how
much are you willing to spend on the
full VR setup so when I say that I mean
the headset what do you think is a fair
maybe not fair but what do you think is
an affordable and fair price for a
headset and on the hardware required to
utilize that headset so those are the
main things I'm interested in this is
not going to be an in-depth video that's
really all there is to it leave a
comment below let us know what you think
what your answers are to those questions
that will help us kind of tune our VR
coverage going forward and also help us
relay some of that information to the
manufacturers at the next trade show we
see the night whatever that may be so as
always patreon link apparel video thank
you for watching I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
