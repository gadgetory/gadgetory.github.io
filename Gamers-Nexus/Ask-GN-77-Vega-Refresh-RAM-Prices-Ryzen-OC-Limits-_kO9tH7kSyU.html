Jian as always leave your questions in
the comment section below for next
week's episode which we're doing too
right now I've shot three episodes now
this is the third we did a public action
which should be up by now we did the
patreon z-- asked Jian extended edition
you can go to patreon.com/scishow sexist
to get access to that now we're doing
the third one because you all had a lot
of questions and we wanted to make sure
we got a lot of them this time so before
getting to that this is brought to you

Emma sighs gaming axe PCBs are high
quality with well built power management
and coolers that we've previously
recommended learn more at the links in
the description below question number
one for this one
Lucien Thomas Q says question for ass PN
does AMD intend to do something similar
to rise in refresh to Vega products I
mean to go on lower lithography in order
to get better performance and less
power-hungry
is it possible for them to do that it's
certainly possible whether they intend
to I'm not sure what I can tell you is
that for a while now there's been a
small er Vega product planned I don't
know what's happened to it I don't know
what when or if it's supposed to come
the market I do know and we've revealed
this in a news video that Andy's
supposed to apparently be using nine
gigabit per second memory for some kind
of video card product in the future
towards under beer I don't know what
that's gonna be all I know is that it's
using that kind of memory in theory so I
don't know that's me a Vega product or a
refresh of Polaris or what
what I do know again is that there's a
sort of shrunken down version of Vega
that was supposed to come to bead hasn't
happened yet other than on things like
this Intel nook which is sort of Polaris
anyway so I do not know I would suggest
that towards the end of the year there
should be something from
and the the graphics card Department I
just I'm not positive what it's gonna be
my guess is on eventually there there'll
be some kind of either a lower tier Vega
or a refresh because they can still get
some money out of this line I mean it's
not been around that long we turn my GN
GN award the have not been around that
long and they were kind of stunted in
sales by the memory prices getting
jacked up like crazy so I would expect
it'd be some kind of refresh just to get
some more ROI out of that architecture
but we'll see next one this kind of
related Thompson says wired ear and
price is still so high and continuing to
grow I understand there is a higher
demand now but if you look at any
retailer there's plenty of stock
available GPU prices are crazy at the
moment because stock is very low I can't
buy certain cards on most websites but
DRAM is available everywhere and still
inflated so I have some some insight for
this actually I spoke to a person
recently about all this kind of stuff
and one of the things I learned that I
did not know is that server memory I can
have margins as big as 60% so this is
what I learned recently so when they
sell to enterprise and server companies
their memory they are allocating an
amount of the wafer this is actually
really interesting to the company that
bought it so you've got a wafer it's a
big circle like that and the wafer is
sliced from a silicon crystal and that
wafer which is just a circle kind of
cross-section of the crystal that wafer
is diced into dyes sometimes people call
them dice plural so the dyes that come
out you get for one wafer out of a large
memory supplier there are three of them
micron Samsung Samsung and hynix out of
one of them you can typically get about
1,500 memory chips per wafer if we're
talking gddr5 for example or similar
size chips or ddr4 also and so parts
that wafer or higher quality real estate
than others
so for server &amp;amp; enterprise customers the
company that connects our Sam Center
micron will sell the center of the wafer
to those enterprise customers at a
higher price per die and then the the
sort of outer edges of it where you
might have from what I've been told some
artifacts of lithography I guess I don't
know exactly how it works but apparently
there's some artifact in towards thee as
you work away to the outer edges of the
wafer where the silicon quality can go
down to a point where it might fail
validation for enterprise but not for
desktop consumer they'll pull those and
save them for a lower value product like
desktop memory so what I learned
recently is that desktop had a prized
memory guess some 60% margins why would
you sell - I said desktop Enterprise
Server is what I meant why would you
tell a desktop if your enterprise and
server has 60% of margins that's kind of
where it is and so these people tell us
we're making more money than ever the
memory manufacturers like well I'm not
gonna name people but the folks you
would buy a memory stick from meaning
not the person who makes the memory
module or the memory die but the person
who puts the die on a stick and sells it
to us those people have told me that
they're not making a ton of money
because they're getting charged by the
suppliers and obviously if they say you
know what we don't like that price we're
taking our business elsewhere they've
got basically one other option sometimes
- so what are you gonna do you you don't
have a lot of negotiating power if
you're someone like one of the memory
stick makers that we all buy from and
like I said enterprise is where the
margins are so no one's really focusing
on desktop and then they've got phone
companies like Apple and Samsung who buy
up huge amounts of wafers for their
upcoming phone launches and they're
willing to bid high on them because it's
a high-value product and they're gonna
sell millions and millions of them so
it's tough it's tough to be an
enthusiast right now when our dollar is
valued less because the
we'll get fewer of them for the same
quantity of dyes than they will if they
sell them to someone else I I can't
blame the memory suppliers in that
they're trying to make the most money
for the products look at their stock
charts every prices are up somehow that
correlates with their stock charts I
wonder how that happens so there is from
from what I understand there's really no
reason for these people
to fight for you to have lower prices
because the the longer this shortage
goes on whether it's partially
artificial or not the more money they
make they got more investment coming in
because it looks like everything looks
great for the supplier they're the king
of the market right now so your question
why are they still so high even though
there's inventory it's because the
retailers are paying a lot the people
who make the memory stick or paying a
lot and the person who's getting all
that money it's it's not really
ultimately the retailer or the memory
maker in terms of like the stick maker
it's the actual memory supplier who
makes all that money and there's not a
lot we can do about it you know China
there that I forget the name of it but
China has got a group that investigates
price-fixing and trade legal issues and
memory suppliers are being actively
investigated for price-fixing in China
at least so we'll see if that goes
anywhere but I'll have more on this
topic eventually there's a lot that I
picked up recently from the people I've
been speaking with we were exposed to a
lot of people at memory suppliers it's
been a great educational experience and
I need to just kind of compile it all
into one video and talk about it next
one supa you previously mentioned that
there's no tolerance for failing to
spread their own tastes across the
entire die of a GPU when attaching an
aftermarket cooler with this in mind how
often should throne face be replaced to
ensure small spots such as edges and
corners don't dry out and results in a
dead GPU I don't think you have to worry
about that too much I don't think you
have to worry about a GPU dying because
adequate thrown paste spread is getting
dry I would not stress about that that
said it's gonna depend on the paste so
stock paste is almost universally not
that great and if you feel like taking
your cart apart it's really not bad to
just replace it when you get it because
chances are stuff you can buy is gonna
be better as far as letting that remain
stock and replacing it eventually
there's not I don't know I like just
kind of keep an eye on temperatures
there's no hard rule there's no rule
that says paste dries up after a year
you should replace it then it's gonna
depend on your use it's gonna depend on
what the manufacturer used and I would
just say if you really want to be
diligent more so than 90% of the market
if you want to be in that top percentile
of people who really pays attention Dov
like kinda like someone who pays a lot
of attention to their car and maintains
their own cars anything with the
computers I would recommend running a
very controlled thermal test when you
first build the system and when I say
very controlled light I don't mean it
doesn't have to be the level of control
we do all you need to do is know what
application you use to test it and use
one piece of software to test it put the
system under a known workload that you
can replicate later and run that test
maybe three times and average your data
for those three test passes today if you
really want to be diligent about it you
can take a thermometer ideally in the
local room otherwise the thermostats in
okay baseline take a number down average
your data and hopefully at average
hopefully like each pass is pretty close
to the next within a degree or so if so
you have good data set it aside run that
same test in a year see how it compares
in a year and then from there you can
make a judgment call most people don't
do that and I would say just keep on an
eye on your temperatures if it starts
looking higher even if you don't have
hard numbers to reference then replace
it a Sutekh you mentioned like the crack
in g 12 or something
a psychic actually makes or buys really
good paste for the stock paste on their
closed-loop liquid coolers I wouldn't
bother replacing that we've messed
around with it and even cryo is not
significantly better now
the theta is different - ultimately with
pastes is not really about temperature
and thermal performance is about aging
and endurance and it's hard to get data
for that because it takes a long time to
test it obviously so you're really just
looking out for thermals over time which
you're just gonna have to check
occasionally and see when it's it's
decaying in performance but cryo has got
its good endurance from what we've
tested they are obviously an advertiser
of ours right now however there's a
reason I allow them to be an advertiser
it's because they actually do have good
endurance and then the stock ace attack
pace we found to have good endurance as
well so if you have a CLC you can just
keep using that you'll probably fine
next question ghost pilot says there
seems to be a gulf between impressive
hardware specs on gigabyte boards and
they're relatively mediocre software
behind the times bios arrangement is
this a criticism they are aware of and
are they taking steps to rectify this is
a great question because this kind of
gets into behind the scenes industry
stuff gigabyte it's very aware of it
they actually the gigabyte has so this
whole industry comes down to a few
things comes down to the people that you
work with in the industry being us for
the most part it comes down to your
relationship with them and then how much
they care about their product how much
they they kind of work with their team
internally to improve that product
gigabyte is has some of the most
proactive staff in terms of trying to
collect our feedback so we've got copy
techs coming up end of May early June
that's in Taiwan every year gigabyte I
know is planning to speak with us and
probably some others on our thoughts on
where their BIOS is weak and could use
improvement and so I would say yes they
they specifically are seeking to improve
their BIOS their hardware it's gotten
really good on some of these boards the
gaming seven
especially and their BIOS is good enough
for most people but it can be improved a
lot so we'll be talking with them I'm
sure they're talking to some extreme
overclockers who are gonna be more
qualified for than I am for statements
on the high end or seaside but from a
usability standpoint from missing
features that I use that I'd like to see
standpoint I can provide some feedback
there others probably provide feedback
see how they're very aware of it and
they are taking steps to improve which I
love seeing and that comes down to the
individuals at the companies because a
lot of the time some of the companies we
work with you can give them feedback and
you just kind of feel like it's never
gonna go anywhere
so like send an email and you're like
okay whatever I tried I did my best I
guess
we're just gonna knock this point on
their product until the end of time
because they keep making them like this
gigabyte it's actually trying it's just
a matter of whether the people we
interface with can convince HQ to make
the changes necessary to to satisfy us
and other people
next question Street and by the way I'll
just say that's exactly the kind of
company we want to work with because if
I if I give them a mixed review or I say
the hardware's fantastic I really want
to see better BIOS and their response to
me is you know what let's work together
on this that's perfect you can't get
better than that in terms of a response
because if they can respond and then
start working slowly towards that goal
that makes everything in the industry
better for the consumer if it's like if
we say their hardware's great and their
BIOS needs work and then their response
is to stop sampling us that's a huge
problem and there are companies like
that too you just can't take an ounce of
criticism so I do very much appreciate
gigabytes approach next question Street
guru why does Rison hit a ceiling for
its frequency designer silicon I can
only answer this so far my
qualifications are not that of a CPU
designer with that stated I'm more on
the practical testing side so I can tell
you what I have
observed and what I've observed is that
I can't speak English right now observed
is that the Verizon to the 2000 series
we've noticed that typically we're
hitting a thermal wall before anything
else so we have we published this that
rise in voltage curve it's really
interesting data if you haven't seen it
and basically we plotted a curve of 100
megahertz increments in frequency versus
the required voltage to stabilize that
frequency without reference clock
changes and it becomes exponential the
curve starts going like like that it's
it's almost like asymptotes and except
in the wrong direction so it's kind of
an exponential curve it would be even
more of an exponential curve if we could
safely keep pushing that but we run out
of thermal Headroom so thermal Headroom
is the first limiter for for us and then
the next one is well I mean really it's
it's thermal Headroom and then I guess
silicon quality at some point the
voltage you can kind of push and push
and it's not gonna be deadly to the chip
until you're like 1 point 6 volts or
something obviously shouldn't run it
that high daily but you could push it
that high it's just a matter of can you
find a cooler that can support it and
once you get that high you're talking
exotic sub ambient cooling not you can't
just put bigger and bigger radiators on
ambient and expect that to work you need
sub ambient at that point so to answer
your question as best as I can the
ceiling that we run into immediately
like 4.2 gigahertz starts look like
thermal and even if the temperatures are
still reasonable you have to remember
that rising now is boosting similarly
two GPUs with GPU boost where it's
taking a collection of sensors there are
dozens of them of the CPU says what's my
temperature and all these locations
what's my voltage what's my leakage fee
droop all this and then figures out high
how high can boost so just like with GPU
boost 3 on NVIDIA cards the lower and
lower the temperature on rise and the
more frequency you can sustain and your
leakage will go down too so you can you
can do this with with less power output
so you even less thermal concern
and also with theoretically slightly
less voltage requirement so at the end
of the day thermal always impacts this
stuff pretty heavily even if it's not
the primary limiter in terms of
frequency area obviously you have some
kind of silicon or design differences to
I can't speak to those in great detail
presently I hope to be able to one day
but I need to talk to someone today
indeed to educate me on that
specifically what I can't say is again
thermal is a big one and the most
immediate that we should all be
concerned about put a good cooler on it
that'll give you a bit more Headroom cuz
we haven't observed in that vote
frequency content we plotted the last
few points with a bigger radio with a
360 instead of a 280 did that because on
the 280 we were getting instability at
say 4.1 4.2 gigahertz
whereas of the 360 we could sustain
those numbers which shows you there's a
thermal impact so thermal is a big one
next one choco cake it says in the vrm
temperature heatsink video did either
gigabyte or asus have a vm temp sensor
built in i always wonder how accurate
are useful those software readings are
i'm not sure if they did honestly i
didn't check issues tends to definitely
have them built in but it's basically
the same theorem on both those board
except one the ACS one uses 60 amp power
stages instead of 40 but there are 3553
s and 3555 is between the two of them so
the sensors tend to be pretty accurate
with software you're always gonna have
some level of inaccuracy particularly
with with the CPU the vrm like the
mosfet sensors that you're talking about
we've tested those did one on camera
with how to kill your motherboard
content and our findings have generally
been at three times we've tested this
now our findings have been with a known
over temperature protection point we are
within 10 degrees celsius with an
external functionally case temperature
with a k-type thermocouple so if I stick
a thermocouple to the top of the mosfet
and it's over temperature protections
one
DC and I forced it 250 degrees C and it
shuts down my thermocouple reading will
be about 10 degrees lower than that
there was one case what was 15 but we're
always 10 to 15 degrees within internal
sensors and you you know they're the way
you can check if they're accurate is
basically over temperature protection if
they have it because if you have
hardware info telling you this thing's
149 degrees and then it goes up one
degree and it shuts down 150 is a pretty
nice round number that's probably over
temperature protection and the datasheet
will confirm that for you so if you can
confirm OTP and then trip it which I
wouldn't recommend unless you really
need to know it's accurate for some
reason then you know one you can
calibrate it if it's off so you trip at
147 0.5 you can kind of calibrate for
that of course keep in mind there's some
wait-and-see there too but yeah so
they're pretty accurate generally
speaking and you can but you can
calibrate if not a balanced diet what do
you do with old hardware you don't need
anymore do you sell it recycle it give
it away etc do you keep everything so
I've answered this several times of the
past years we try to keep as much as we
can GPUs CPUs memory things that are
small ish like a GP is relatively small
things that are small and important to
the channel we keep because we do a lot
of regression testing so revisiting an
old piece of hardware is highly valuable
content if I sell everything I can't do
that so we keep everything I mean like
like everything until physically there's
no more space to keep stuff and then
have this er making decisions cases are
the first to go
I can't reasonably keep every case we
would run out of space in a month so
cases tend to go we keep the we keep
cases that are kind of like milestone
cases really important ones for one
reason or another really bad are really
good and then a couple of highly common
cases so that we can repopulate the
charts when we redo all of our
methodology with the best the absolute
best the absolute worst and the popular
and everything else in between gets cold
now as far as where it goes I don't sell
them generally speaking
every now and then I might sell a case
for half MSRP because I'm not trying to
make money off of I'm trying to get the
 out of my house my sell a case to a
friend or something that they're
building a PC I've kind of saturated
that pool of friends they don't need
more cases just like I don't so for the
last three last two or three years now
we've been donating them to the local
high school where there's a computer
engineering program I can't get a tax
write-off Onix I didn't buy them there
you know manufacturers give them to us
for review so that's unfortunate of
course but they're not my house anymore
and I'm helping a really cool
educational program so it's computer
engineering program at the local high
school where one of our contractors
Patrick stone who helps with CES every
year
he teaches there and so they just
recently outfitted their entire
classroom all of his cases were from
between 2004 and 2008 at the newest and
I gave him like 20 cases and he got all
the students to set up like the the
classroom computer lab computers on
their desks and told them to unbilled it
and transplant all the parts into the
new ones that I gave them state they
have everything from like the Roseville
gun near I don't remember that you
shouldn't haha
from everything from that garbage to
your case to like a be quiet dark bass
700 I think is the most reason I gave
like $180 case so they've got a bit of
everything which was really cool to see
because I taught that class as a guest
speaker recently and it was fun
interacting with it it's cool to see
them get the experience of building with
stuff that's like complete trash and
then super-high on that they can't
afford because they're high school
students so you see like the
appreciation of spending an extra couple
dollars and like people understanding
and learning because they probably don't
know a lot about money at at this age
understanding that like okay if I spend
40 I'm not gonna get something good if I
spend extra twenty dollars it's a huge
increase in value if I spend another
$100 on top of that
the increase in value starts sort of
asymptoting or coming down on a bell
curve or something I'm not not bell
curve you know what I mean that
asymptoting basically so yeah we give a
lot of stuff to that school if it's too
big for me and I haven't really thrown
anything away
where's case it gets like sold or given
to a friend or something but it's kind
of it's kind of a hassle when I when I
have a sold stuff and I we don't really
do this anymore because it's not worth
the time frankly when I have it's a case
and a tap MSRP to a friend to get it the
hell out of my door so it's we're not
trying to prop it off of selling the
products is what I really want to
emphasize here we have shelves of video
card CPUs and RAM for a reason because
this business is built on testing those
things it's not built on selling them so
no we don't sell them unless there's
literally no space and it's the big
stuff that goes first
next question about oh by the way if
anyone has like computer charities or
something that could also use cases
mostly maybe coolers I guess leave a
comment below if you know of any
especially if they're on the East Coast
us and if if the school I give this
stuff who runs out of space then it'd be
good to have somewhere else to give
stuff to that could benefit from it
because I mean I can't use it for much
after we've tested it we have no room
and I can't really get a tax write-off
for it anyway so I'd like someone who
could use it to have it it's all
high-quality generally anyway I'll just
note this to addition to that stuff
where we give the school products I
worked with Ace attack not long ago ace
attacks at the time represented we
worked with contacted me and basically
was like Steve do you need any liquid
coolers and I said yes sure we'll take
like five take five big ones and he said
that doesn't help me at all I was like
how many do you need to get rid of he
said three hundred or something like
that and so the story was all these
companies they eventually end up with
overstock at some point and if they
don't sell it they're spending money for
that stuff to sit in a warehouse in the
case of base attack I think they were
coming out with a new generation that
stuff was perfectly good but they
basically
to throw it out because they were out of
they need you no need to bring the new
generation and so I worked with him I
said well I don't want 300 coolers don't
send me a palette of coolers
here's what you can do send them the
Patrick stone at the school and let him
teach the kids about liquid coolers they
can tear them down they can install them
in systems whatever and so he did that
we have some I think stone took a video
of them opening it they were all very
excited so it's pretty fun to facilitate
that that's the kind of thing I want to
do more in the future as we grow and
gain influence to do that type of thing
there's a lot of overstock a lot of
product gets thrown away and it's just
because it's more expensive for them to
keep it but if we can help facilitate
stuff like that it's good for everyone
next question is from Jordan P who says
you commented on the rate racing video
that Nvidia's tom peterson had provided
feedback on your sea of thieves console
benchmarking there's a common that
industry contacts will give you feedback
will contact you on videos and and that
aren't directly tied to one of their
products or reviewing a competitor yes
check in the audio I'm recording this
alone tonight so yeah it is pretty
common Tom Peterson is a very sharp guy
he basically invented FCAT he more or
less created the VR benchmarking tools
that that we've used in the past and
they're some of the best tools for VR
benchmarking right now so we respect his
opinion a lot the reason I commented on
that is because for our console
benchmarking I know that Tom's very
invested in frame time testing and so is
Scott Watson who's nowaday I'm the
informally tech report and I've
consulted with both of them about
testing methodology for consoles and for
PCs of you know what what things we need
to look at what terminology should we
use can you correct any of these things
I've done can you tell me like what
would you improve here what do you think
we did really well did I get anything
absolutely wrong
I'll ask for that feedback if I don't
ask for it sometimes I'll hear anyway
and get some really good advice so yeah
Tom mentioned when we were interviewing
him for that r-tx stuff you mentioned
that he had seen our sea of Thieves
content and he liked it he had a couple
of ideas found it very interesting that
sea of thieves tears which I also found
interesting neither of us expected that
on a console so that was very unique
behavior very strange for games a tear
on an xbox one but yeah we actually hear
someone frequently about content we make
often I will hear what a representative
thinks of something we made about one of
their competitors more than about their
own product and when I say
representative you have to remember they
don't always speak for their own company
right the one they work for they often
just speak for themselves just keeping
in touch saying like hey I saw your
video so recently we had an advertising
contact tell us that they saw the vacuum
video and they were involved in
coordinating that campaign and basically
said that they had no hard feelings they
thought it was pretty funny so
everything gets around at some point
yeah I gotta be careful now what I say
I'm Annie 99 what temp should I look to
keep my CP and GB under 1 overclocked
and seeking quite operation I'm playing
with the idea of deleting my 87 hard K
it's currently under H 100 IV 2 times
below 55 but noisier than I want so man
if you're under 55 you have plenty of
headroom C Intel CPUs are a bit
different
Intel CPUs will run the same frequency
whether you're if it's got a t.j.maxx of
a hundred it'll run the same frequency
up to 99 it'll do so less efficiently
you'll have some power leakage you'll
have obviously higher temperatures in
kind of a runaway fashion as temperature
increases it increases up to a point so
you might end up in sort of a runaway
scenario but if you keep it under
t.j.maxx though it'll run out the speeds
you've asked it to so you don't need to
be sub
five that's very aggressive cooling if
you're like everyone's got a different
number for what they're happy with with
temperature and to some extent it's all
like voodoo arcane magic that's based on
nothing but there is some science to it
for example capacitors fasteners are
rated at generally 85 or 105 C and at
those ratings they'll have an hour
rating like 2.5 thousand hours five
thousand ten thousand whatever and then
every 10 degree cells as you go over
that you have like an order of magnitude
loss and lifespan so there's some
science to it absolutely but you don't
need to be at 55 if if you're at 55 and
you're like my fans are just just a
little bit annoying I would say drop the
speeds like 10% see if you're happy with
that noise level if your temperatures
are still under 70 still under 80 you're
fine going over 80 the only reason the
reason it really starts to kind of
matter is because you get some heat
buildup in that area of the board if you
are if you forget to clean out your
front end take on the case you forget to
clean out the radiator you have a lot
less Headroom for that error so the only
really main advantage for an average
user I'm not talking big overclocks here
main advantage to keeping your
temperatures lower is is that you have
more Headroom if something goes wrong if
one of your two fans fails if your front
intake gets clogged with dust you've got
way more Headroom to lose ground but
you've got a lot of room here so I mean
just just drop the speeds if you're
under 80 that's pretty good temperature
you're under 90 it's still fine but yeah
everyone's got a different number they
like for that TCAPS
says when developing the mod mat what
was design iteration like while working
with a manufacturer a factory in this
case you mentioned iterating on
materials and color consistency was that
prototype in the house with instructions
sent to them was it discussed with them
they sent samples to you how long our
iteration times we talked a bit about
this in the what we learned from
manufacturing it
iteration times be pretty long so to get
a sample made you're talking it might
take some one week to make it and then
they'll ship it you might have customs
to deal with that can delay things a lot
but it's a couple weeks it's like a
really good turnaround time is like two
weeks and so you really don't want to do
too many samples if you can avoid it but
obviously the fewer samples you do the
more you're threading that line of like
what if something goes wrong it's just
like software where if you fix a bug
you're worried that you've introduced a
new on so when we were doing initial
iterations and we send them like you
know this is all really great please
don't change do not change anything
change this one thing though and they
might send us a new sample and that one
thing's fixed but they also fixed
something else that we didn't want them
to fix so eventually you get to a point
where it's exactly what you want but up
until that point you're basically like
90% of what you want and every time that
last 10% is something different so it is
really frustrating but but we got it
worked out it just took a lot of time
weeks and weeks so I totally appreciate
why product development life cycles are
so long now what else was asked to your
prototype in the house now we we kind of
knew exactly what we wanted and I had
materials in mind I had I have
experience buying like $100 anti-static
mats from industrial suppliers in the US
so I knew what I wanted in terms of
quality we just had to put together a
high-quality print with a high-quality
mat and that was actually proved to be
difficult we finally found a factory
though and we're very happy with it it's
a completely custom product it's not
like it's not like like if I want to
make a keyboard I could go to a thousand
keyboard factories and say I want that
with that font and those color key caps
and that plastic and it kind of be pick
and choose pretty good you can
absolutely make really custom keyboard
put a ton of time into it pour your life
into it make something really cool but
the point I'm getting at is this was not
something that we could point out on a
shelf and say I want that because
what we got was I want that material and
I want you to print a really
high-quality print on it and we needed
to figure out how to make this something
I can afford so yeah
in terms of like things we did in house
the design was in a house completely I
concept today Andrew put it all in
software and instructions were sent to
them we had to for example we have to
pick out like tell them exactly what
colors we wanted even though we sent
them a digital file they wanted us to
specifically name the colors with hex
code or a Pantone or something like that
just to make sure they understood
exactly we wanted so design iteration
was not too hard because we do that we
control that internally the the hard
part or the scary part is if you iterate
on or change a design you're kind of
scared that they're gonna change more
than you've asked them to so once we got
it to the state of ten right now we're
basically like stop don't touch it leave
it alone
just make more of them and then I when
we get them I personally inspect
obviously all the ones I autograph which
is actually good because it it makes me
look at a lot of the mattes for quality
control and we inspect like forty to
sixty percent of them but we just got
tooling made for it so the the hands-on
requirement for that should decrease
because there's a lot of work
last one nori oh yeah how does it feel
to have people willing to pay an extra
20 bucks premium for your signature on
your already awesome mod Matt it's it's
interesting I mean like I get it because
I I've paid for like four albums that
are signed by the bands like I have
graphed AFI albums and stuff like that
so I totally get it I don't really like
it's still kind of I guess just like
surreal like I don't know I don't not
fully caught up with it yet I will say
from the standpoint of like provided as
a product it's really cool because I
Drive 30 minutes each way to distributor
I have to unroll the mass we roll them
quality control jacket all that stuff it
is definitely extra work to sign them
but our investment other than my time to
drive out there and do that stuff
there's no more material investment than
the marker so it's nice because it's
like it's extra padding for someone who
either really wants to support the site
and what we do or someone who just is
you know as a fan and wants wants that
literal hands-on with the mat on it and
the extra money goes a long way so I
certainly appreciate it and I appreciate
why people want autographs because I've
wanted autographs from from people I've
bought stuff from the past too so I get
it but it's like I mean it's a YouTube
channel
240,000 whatever subscribers so still
getting used to it basically I don't add
it up I don't know how to feel about it
anyway thanks for questions leave more
in the comments section below as always
leave me some tech questions if you see
good ones up put the hell out of them
it's getting really hard for me to find
them these days so please up vote your
peers if they ask a really good question
you want to see an answer to and
subscribe for more go to
patreon.com/scishow stew get the bonus
episode from the last one and as always
you get a store doc here--is taxes done
that to pick up one of these mod mats
actually these things will be on there
too so this this one in this one these
are really freaking cool
I will talk about these more in the
future these are 3d laser engraved glass
cubes we made with the logo and the
reason isn't just to make more merch
we're actually gonna be using these for
do I want to reveal it right now yeah
sure we're going to be using these for
rewards basically so when a manufacturer
makes like the coolest product at
Computex or something like that this is
gonna be our here's your best of show
award great job you made the best
motherboards that we saw this year
whatever so it's an award but we're also
gonna sell them on the store so anyway
there'll be a store I gave us access net
if you want to look at them thanks for
watching I'll see you all next time
