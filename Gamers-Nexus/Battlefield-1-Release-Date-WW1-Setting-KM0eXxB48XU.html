counting a couple days ago EA launched
the campaign blitz for the next
battlefield title called battlefield 1
and presumably the title refers to the
game setting which was previously
confirmed as World War 1 the newly
released trailer as well as the two hour
livestream celebrating the franchise
finalised the setting that had been
accidentally leaked months ago through
neogaf the forum and the new battlefield
one trailer packs a lot of machinery and
violence into its 60 second run time we
see some of the prototype tanks that
dominated the wastelands of Europe in
the latter half of the war aerial
dogfights are featured prominently in
the trailer and there's even a Zeppelin
featured for a leading role in its short
cinematic strikingly a rather violent
depiction of one man killing another
with a shovel recalls stories of them
the First World War and one of the only
parts of the trailer that looks like it
could be gameplay shows one of the
infamous gas attacks definitely some
pretty serious stuff packed into this
trailer a couple segments appear to have
come straight out of Lawrence of Arabia
showing a possibly Arabian or ottoman
soldier on horseback and despite the
dogfights horseback riding and what was
possibly Ian Fleming running around in a
mansion the trenches are unavoidable how
the developers plan to bring trench
warfare and going over the top in the
game is yet undisclosed as EA points out
however in the trailers description
World War one was the dawn of quote
all-out war the result of this all out
war was that the European front became
dominated by trench warfare men standing
and trenches taking potshots at one
another until one side charges into
machine-gun fire hasn't traditionally
been a popular way to make an FPS game
but there's plenty to this because EA
and dice of course with battlefield have
always had vehicles and big bombastic
dogfights and ocean fights and all this
stuff that can really hopefully brane
world war one to life in a new way how
dice chooses to overcome this in both
single-player and 64 person multiplayer
games will likely decide the fate of the
upcoming battlefield title they've
certainly had their share of mrs. lately
like with the hardline series that I
almost forgot the name of just now
battlefield one has an official launch
date of October 21st so the right on
target
for their earlier investor report where
they did note that date an early and
lister deluxe edition is available for
eighty dollars what laughable light
which certainly advise you not to buy
into that we always suggest waiting for
reviews but it moves the launch to the
18th so if you want to spend that extra
money you could I guess get in there a
couple days earlier if it's really that
important to you in addition to this
advertising on the livestream indicates
that the game will be available quote
first on Xbox and PC and what this
actually means is yet to be seen I don't
know if that means Playstations in the
mix I don't know if it means that xbox
or pc one might proceed the other but
that is what they said in their live
stream so that's all I have for you for
battlefield one we're curious to hear
what you think leave a comment below
tell us what you think the naming what
you think the setting where you think
they'll go with it and as always patreon

directly thanks for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
