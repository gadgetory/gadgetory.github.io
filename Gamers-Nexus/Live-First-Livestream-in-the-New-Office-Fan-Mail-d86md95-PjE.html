time doing a stream and the the new
office so we'll see how it does the
Internet should be fine but why why did
someone say gamers Nexus is Canadian
it's anyway so we should be live let me
know if not let me know if the audio is
not working normally normally that's
fairly reliable in chat and we are and
CSC home of GN GN this Canadian hi okay
yes people say it's live all right cool
so live and audio is working thank you
much appreciated okay alright I've got
enough of a sample size now where anyone
he says not working is line which is
actually pretty common especially when I
ask a specific question if things are
working he people will take the
opportunity to say no it's not working
alright so all we're gonna do here is
test the setup and an open some fan mail
don't like doing unboxings I guess
that's what this is we're gonna live
with it
there were so we just opened that p.o
box like a week ago and went by today
and it was overflowed and there was a
note in it that we had to go to the desk
to pick up more stuff because it had
overflowed and they ran out of space so
yeah so we are we're gonna go through
some of this stuff I'll show a few
things we've been working on today as
well but anyway a couple a couple of
short things to go through
RTX 2080 hand it over don't I don't
actually have that yet I'm not giving it
to you it's so yes so no the r-tx 2080
is not being handed over yeah so we got
a couple of cool things in this one is
the only one we've pre opened and and
frames because they were clearly posters
and we'll show you that in a bit but
thank you to everyone who sent stuff in
basically if you if you missed it we in
a news video asked for people to send in
whatever kind of old hardware you have
old CPUs stuff like that so we can frame
it make some wall art out of its the
walls are pretty barren if the whole
office is just completely barren walls
and we've got all the equipment in but
the office itself needs some life and I
want some stuff in the background for
live streams so this will be our
livestream area so I wanted to invite
the community to send stuff Alana and
most of you sent some send some stuff
pretty quickly from what he saw so the
plan is to go through it see what we can
maybe frame or something like that make
some cool kind of like CPU history thing
with the stuff that fan sent along and
some of you even included so I had
several emails come in where people were
asking what if we needed the particular
device and then to included a
description of the history of that
device so some people were telling us
about like there's eons that they'd
overclocked and Alphonse that they got
however many years ago and these 64 era
CPUs stuff like that so I mean if you
wanted to send something and you send it
with a note we'll try and include that
in whatever piece of art we end up
making for the wall definitely
appreciated and you only send stuff that
you you generally don't need anymore and
you don't have any sentimental
attachment to it or not not trying to
take stuff you want but if you're trying
to get rid of it and it's old and cool
we could use it for the wall for sure so
a couple things here hi any any update
on the smaller mod map the medium matte
we have another yes we have another
sample coming in this week so these
large mattes we have the next round is
shipping to us within the next couple of
days if you want one you get a store
docking razaaq's it's not net and
backorder it it's a 4 foot by 2 foot
PC modding surface and super high
quality rubbers and materials but the
medium one for those of you who can't
fit a 4 by 2 mat on your table is going
to be something closer to 32 by 16 but
we're waiting on the sample it ships
this week and I should know hopefully
once it comes in if it's any good we'll
we'll be able to start producing it and
get it on the store but yeah the the
large ones are on their way back in now
so if you backorder on the store and
actually we have a store wide livestream
discount of do it live you buy anything
during the stream and you type in do it
live
then you'll get a 10% discount of any
order until the end of the stream so
yeah anyway let me check any other any
other suit we got nori five dollars
thank you Andrew co-host maybe also
where's snowflake we are going through
withdrawals snowflake is at the house
well we have some stuff we're doing
b-roll of soon we haven't done much
b-roll really in the sense moving so
we're obviously the video cards will get
a lot of b-roll once we get those in so
I'll make sure she's sitting some of
those shots Sean
$10 I just wanted to send a super chat
success thank you and met a gave 400 HUF
who said what CPU is it though it's
actually there's not the southern 980 XE
this time thank you for keeping the meme
alive this one we're streaming out of
nineteen fifty X right now and what will
the potential pricing be for the medium
mod Matt I don't know because no it's
not going to be half the mod Matt
because that's not how it works
that's not how production works so I
don't know yet because I don't know what
my cost is but it'll be more than what
you asked for it cuz it's definitely
will pay more than that and then
corporal candle like two dollars I also
just want to send a super jet thank you
very much alright so yeah stuff we have
here
first of all brought to you by thermal
grizzly we have links below if you want
to pick up any other stuff I've got
hydronaut in my hands but there's cryo
not and conductor not links below say
high thermal conductivity thermal paste
or liquid metal in the case of conduct
or not you can check that out at the
links as always let's get through some
of this stuff here first of all the AMD
posters so these came in in the large
tube and we wanted to just pre frame
these because posters kind of get stuck
curled but this one which one is this
one of these is for AMD M is it Emmy and
one is for XP yam DX PCB is here you go
so check this out
this is this is from one of our viewers
and I step back a bit and it's got some
weird stock photo on it from the old AMD
campaign
but hang on let me let me adjust this so
I can read it myself I need a PC
processor that lets in different
different font different size different
boldness lets me rule my digital world
AMD me the AMD Athlon XP processor
copyright 2003 if you're wondering so
it's it's from the from the era around
actually when I started building pcs so
that is that's one of the AMD posters
how's that showing up andrew is that
okay and then the next and the poster
and thank you to the viewer who sent
that along we definitely appreciate it
we framed it immediately I think by the
way we have access to some old Nvidia
AMD and Intel posters and and marketing
materials so the plan is to hopefully
frame some of those get them in the
office and then we'll have a bit of
representation of everyone but AMD is
the first which of course means that our
audience is full of Andy shills the next
one is performance for everyday it says
I want a PC in larger letters processor
in weird subtext they're not like
they're not even on the same line a PC
processor that works and plays like I do
again with random bold AMD me the AMD
Athlon XP processor copyright 2003 if
you're wondering the era and more stock
photos but it's an old old and the ad
from the a and the XP series so if you
remember it we've got some of that and
some one just I see some super chats
coming in but thank you for for sending
those along I will let me check the
package and see what see what your name
isn't if we can share who that is this
one is from Steven from Lockhart Texas
so thank you Steven for sending that
along much appreciated
pretty cool first framed posters we have
we're gonna be framing our own video
card Anatomy poster actually which we
can probably get a link and chat for
that it's on the store so a plan is to
frame one of those in just an eighth
it's an 18 by 24 poster so we got a
store down cameras access net or we'll
have maybe a link in chat for the video
card tear down poster that ones that's
the next get framed I think but we have
this thing behind me too so this is one
we
just open some fan mail this is one that
I bought on eBay except what I bought
was and I'll read the chat in a minute
what I bought was supposed to just be a
silicon wafer and it was except they put
it in a bendy envelope and there was no
packaging of any kind and based on where
the damage occurred on the wafer it
we're pretty certain that it got bent
during delivery in half so anyway
Patrick spent a decent amount of time
today working on this you did a great
job and you'll see there there are
cracks and so in two of these large
pieces it's very unfortunate so I bought
it on ebay it was like $25 and it was
supposed to be perfect wow that looks
awesome on camera actually so it was
supposed to be perfect but for 25 bucks
and the time to fight over it I thought
you know what we'll I'll just let
Patrick do what he wants to do and he
was able to get it looking pretty damn
good it looks a lot worse earlier so
anyway yes press f to pay respects
everybody have to pay respects please
and this piece is looking looking great
and then we have individual pieces here
and we just sort of framed it like an
explosion diagram and shape it into the
GN logo we do have a diamond wafer
cutter so I guess we could do that I
bought one of those recall the box on
eBay as well thank you for the app for
respects it's you know it was tragic
when we saw that it occurred but your
your apps for respects make it much
easier to to bear yeah so it's got some
damage but it looks really cool and this
I don't know someone in chat said they
thought it was a memory wafer I'm
actually not sure where it came from the
label on the package did say AMD wafer
number 73
but it's eBay so for all I know they
could have said that just because they
knew that calling it am the Intel or
Nvidia would sell more than like Texas
Instruments or something like that so
anyway that was pretty cool we're gonna
put like a name card in one of these
corners probably and just say like what
it is which is silicon wafer
and maybe a bit of history about the
process of making one looks really good
though if you want them one like this
eBay and Aliexpress have tons of these
things some of them look better than
others some of them arrive shattered but
if you wanted to pick one up because
you're inspired by this they're actually
very easy to get and not not that
expensive kind of kind of afraid okay so
that was really cool I'll show you some
of the other stuff I bought in a bit but
let's do let's open one of these to open
one of these from viewers this is from
from Brian from Greenwood Indiana see
what Brian Santa lon
it's trying to reach a - I missed the
old studio it was cozy I mean like can
we show that it hasn't changed that is
the old studio the only difference is
that I can now do this and then I can do
this and I no longer have to do this to
get out of the set after we're done
filming because that is what I I used to
have to do I'm sorry I missed the old
studio but I was going to miss my back
pretty soon
haha so here in a much better shot to do
your spot to do better shooting better
videos all that stuff the old place was
way better this is like the well is the
kitchen where's the kitchen
alright so next the head like I said
this one is from Brian and Brian sent
along oh that's cool
an Intel Pentium 2 heatsink so there's
some history for you
peti him - actually the backs pretty
cool - but we'll show that first there's
Intel's branding with the old drop II in
the middle there just show us again how
you cut out of the set no
all right and the new one or the I'm
reading comments at the same time yeah
hide the address it's blacked out that
that's the P o box it's like how do you
think they got the stuff to us it's
public thank you though for your concern
I definitely appreciate it
because that is something that's
obviously a point of concern but anyway
that's that's probably and it's in the
description of this video so Brian also
sent along Intel CPUs that are in a bag
I'm assuming that if they did once work
they don't anymore
given how how the Postal Service handled
the wafer that was shipped to us what do
we have these look pretty cool so what
are these if if you wanted to see some
CPU history today and I'll have to look
most of these up because I was not
paying attention at the time they were
launching Celeron what is I don't know
what's Q this is they're just check out
the back side of that one so PG a not
many pins on these these are definitely
older what is this one this is an old
intel 2001 1.75 volt chip Pentium 3 this
is a Pentium 3 right here
so let me that one right there is a
Pentium 3 with that sort of exposed dye
and this is a seller on from probably
about is that the same era does not have
a year 2000 about the same era so that's
a that's a seller on from 2000 this is a
Pentium 3 from what did I say 2001 we've
got whatever this is another Intel CPU
from 2002 and if you're wondering are
these deleted I actually am NOT positive
if any of these ever had a lid but I can
tell you that Andy and Intel both
shipped a lot of products with no IHS
because back in the day didn't need to
these didn't des need to deal ed didn't
have it it didn't have a lid
and that was gotten away with because
there was too easy to break processors
in part so this the IHS has protect the
users from themselves a bit in tell it
what when is that oh that's 2004 so
there's a Pentium 4 for you the Pentium
4 had a very interesting and troubled
history at times one of my I think my
first CPU was a Pentium 4 with
hyper-threading and I don't know if
that's what this is but the one I had
was Pentium 4 with hyper-threading
hyper-threading had all kinds of issues
back when that was new and it was the
poor man's dual-core next one Intel
copyright so that's a 86 now that is not
correct I can't read
0:06 yes that makes much more sense it's
like Core 2 quad 86 that doesn't make
sense so Intel 2006 Core 2 quad that's
of course a classic and then we've got
one more which is a 2005 II 6550 I
remember that one actually very well
Core 2 Duo where's this Core 2 quad or
2o
Core 2 quad I've got a Q 6600 as well by
the that was that was my that's not what
this is I don't think but the q 66 today
q 9400 so my next CPU one of them anyway
was a Q 6600 and that CPU was a beast
and still around but there's the I think
successor to it except a lower skew and
the later family and then this is the
Core 2 Duo which is of course famous is
this sanam son this is from Sun so AMD
and Sun micro if anyone remembers Sun
did a lot of database stuff to what
isn't these look pretty cool actually so
this is all let me keep some of this in
the box is all from Brian thank you
Brian pretending this Ilan that's pretty
damn cool ultrasparc three and then
another lowercase I let's get a close-up
on the Hat so this was this one was was
definitely in use got some thermal paste
cleaned off of it the q 6600 was abused
I agree with you
so yeah ultrasparc three lowercase I I'm
not familiar with this processor it's I
don't know if it's
if it's called no ultrasparc for and
I'll just mark three I was not you I
never used any Sun products 2001 for
this one and it I don't know the exact
identity of this one I there are a lot
of numbers on there I did not use Sun
products but as PGA it's got a pretty
cool IHS it's got a cool purple PCB and
then there's another Sun product the
another ultrasparc right there stop
touching the pins yes you're correct I
might I might damage the processor that
shipped in this through the Postal
Service I might be the one who causes
damage you're absolutely right
I should be much more careful with it
yeah so these are really cool there's an
AMD product and the Athlon 64 x2 that
one that's one I know of I actually if
you ever want to learn a lot about CPUs
one of the best things I can recommend
you do is is go back in time and read
the ANA tech review of the Athlon 64
products because mr. shim peed an
excellent job in detailing them and he
goes through a lot of detail that is
applicable even today ultrasparc 3i
thank you for the for the note on what
the name is ultrasparc 3i is the name of
that son processor so anyway if you want
to learn about CPUs I can highly
recommend their old Athlon or their 64
series CPU reviews this one is an AMD
phenom 2 that's another one I'm familiar
with so we have some phenom twos an hour
in our lab that we've done testing with
somewhat recently build the Solaris
based computer now yeah I guess we've
gotta kind of get in that way
son ultrasparc - this looks really cool
actually so this is a STP 1032 LGA
processor you can see on the back it is
one of the few LGA processors we've
opened in the last few minutes and it is
a Sun ultrasparc - product looks pretty
damn cool you can see the the cutout in
the IHS for what looks to be just small
SMDs
so
that that was probably not next not not
a cheap part to make that IHS all right
oh no static someone says all right so
that's the first one thank you for
sending that along Brian some really
cool stuff let me look at the super
chance for a second so we had a couple
brickma quickly said $2 Lowell test
stream Jack reitman $5 just wanted to
send super chat also a response your
discord D hems please shark cams and
friends $10 oh and I also wanted to send
one from here hi Steve big wave hi hi
shark I'm shark comes has a twitch
channel and I think he's giving away one
of the GN teardown cubes or something
for for I don't know is that the charity
giveaway you're doing next one Lord de
kappa $2 I'm only here because he told
me to ignore it excellent the plan is
working all future content will be
called r-tx 2080 review please ignore
hassles $5 you're brilliant mate awesome
content thank you very much Ricky Lee
you look like you could use some
McNuggets $5 I could use some food yes
we will add that to the list we shall
start a list posthaste and plan the the
fast food tour after the stream
Bob is 32 commentary $5 thank you just
finished packing up some AMD CPUs to
send your way I can't wait to see the
finished office I you know I can't
either but I I do question whether it
will ever truly be finished we're in a
state now where the office moving vlog
will probably eventually turn into
something like like the office upgrade
vlog or something like that I think
it'll be a constant work in progress
there's enough here for us to work with
that I actually will want to change it
to improve our process and and methods
and everything but I yes we will do a
tour once we think it's in basically a
finished State
procopius Jones $5 I need a PC youtuber
that benchmarks and vacuums like I do
GN me no one no one here vacuum is we're
actually legally not allowed to receive
the vacuuming C&amp;amp;D Brandon aye
ten dollars when will the OFI on case
review come let me see if I can
disconnect that system and bring it over
can you still hear me Andrea okay so
give me one second guys I'm grabbing the
open case and this for those of you who
have not already seen the benefits of
the office you will now see why it's so
great because I can just go walk to the
test room next tour and grab something
and not have to just tell you to check
back later there it is it's happening
somehow we've still run out of room I
don't know how that happens so there's
the Ophion or however you pronounce it
there's a risin Tek case we saw it at
Computex it's a mini ITX box we are
still working on it so we're still
trying to figure out exactly what we
want to do for additional testing but if
you've been wondering about it it is
here it's been through testing and it's
got an extra fan on the top right now as
indicated by our beautiful Noctua
pull-tabs and this is it's got it's got
some changes so it's got some changes
from Computex originally the spacing
here did not exist it was just flat
against the side so so that's an
improvement there are I think some other
changes to we'll talk about in the
review but we're probably filming the
review this week or something like that
I think and just pending Patrick's
thoughts on it he's been working on it
while I've been working on prepping for
GPUs with old cards so anyway that's
that's the case you've been wondering
about it it is here and it has been
tested for the most part any others here
Kyle Mitchell $2 hashtag snowflake
she'll be back for the GPU biro Hall
Sargent Zeta 13 $37 thank you very much
test comment do not read dammit
five British pounds from the Martin C
one two three how do one cool a CPU pre
IHS do they just stick a heatsink on the
bairdi also go cat
scream okay we've got McNuggets an
ice-cream homilist
so yeah it you would direct mount and
the the thing with anything where you're
exposing these are pretty small
obviously I mean it's not there we go
they are significantly smaller pieces of
silicon than we work with on a lot of
products today memory is is not too
different from this I suppose but yeah
so the trouble with pre IHS stuff is
that it is pretty easy if you do not
torque things properly to crack the die
the size of it being smaller does assist
because a large die is much more
susceptible to things like cracking so
okay couple more and then we'll get back
to the boxes clay Hall $5 keep up the
great work thank you very much clay
Douglas M $5 excuse me $4.99 gladly
livestreams are back oh and I vote
barbecue for dinner okay big nuggets ice
cream BBQ I'm getting nods from Ryan in
the background
Joseph clover two British pounds I have
a Commodore vic-20 to send but too
expensive you mean too expensive to ship
or something send me an email and I'll
I'm not sure exactly what that part is I
have to look into it but send me an
email and if you mean to expense it
because you want to keep it and let me
just keep it because we're not in dire
need but of course we think that stuff's
cool
Nico seven seven oh two five two lawyers
next time you see Linus step on his toes
I'm not sure I guess he does where it
would teach him a lesson about wearing
open face shoes or open toe shoes open
face he does put his face in them on
occasion I've seen it Mike Collins five
dollars I usually walk we've got three
more and I'm getting back to them I
usually watch your videos at 2x speed
but this feels slow and weird can you
start talking can you start existing at
2x speed thanks no you're very $2.00 for
Mountain Dew blast Total Wine up $5
crazy that one day tr4 will be a legacy
CPU on your wall okay that was the best
I could hear sorry Thank You total
wind-up
last one before I move on data file $10
I'll want to send over some older parts
since you're doing wall art I have a few
dead GPUs is there anything else you all
want or would want for dead old legacy
parts I think I have some ddr2 and some
PC cards not sure yet
we'll probably think of a project with
GPS at some point but I don't know what
it is yet so I'm not gonna openly ask
for them right now because I don't know
what I want to do with GPUs I was
thinking originally I've just buying
some on eBay if I didn't already have
them and getting like like a stepping of
five shelves on a wall or something and
just showing the showing the the seminal
parts from the different eras but we
also had some ideas of like getting a
bunch of heatsinks together and making
like a heatsink wall or mounting them to
like a pegboard or something like that
so we have some ideas I don't know yet
though but we'll probably try and do
something at some point with them but
keep an eye out keep an eye out for that
okay so moving onto the next one we have
lots to go through here
first a note if you're just joining we
have a lot more viewers than we did bit
ago there's a GM store discount during
the stream it's do it live you can enter
that coupon code and get 10% off of any
order until the end of the stream
including we just restocked the GN mugs
so these keep selling out we just
restock them and there's our back in
time for for the live stream so the next
box I don't know what we want to do next
we have a couple of options here I think
let's go for one of the envelopes that's
on the table we move this aside so let's
go for this one from Jonathan from
Pennsylvania and this is Terry this one
I think
what does this do it lie wait what are
the comments 27 or someone saying I get
it got a notification 27 minutes late
yeah sorry I can't control YouTube
alright so what is this someone says 30
years of GPUs in the world's most
inefficient mine rig I like it I like
where you're going it's it's probably
off something someone's tried so who
knows maybe we'll find out that one of
those old GPUs actually is superior in
hash rate oh and I think there was a
note from the previous user is this from
yes I believe so Brian from the previous
previous one just noted that he pulled
out these old CPUs wasn't sure what
exactly some of them were used in or for
and they probably ran stock clocks and
not sure if they were still functional
before being scrapped and then said that
the p2 and the Sun amassed ones are the
most interesting I agree with you there
let me set this aside all right so this
one is from Jonathan from Piatt from
Pennsylvania
it's an AMD FX 8350 viously overclocked
4.6 gigahertz at one point four four
volts just wanted to say thank you to
everyone at gamers Nexus for the amazing
job you guys do thank you very much
Jonathan and yes the 83-70 is a special
part for me because people are starting
to line us about this too we're talking
about how a lot of the the youtubers and
Technology journalists don't actually
use the best of the best in their home
systems for example I have an FX 83-70
in mine
that's down clocked and under-voltage
because it's in a garbage mother Ford
whose vrm overheats frequently so I had
the down clock it under rolled it but it
works fine for QuickBooks and Chrome I
guess so I haven't needed to change it
thank you for sending that along let's
do the next one and I'm gonna go through
the through all these first just because
they're a bit easier to do this one is
from Matt local actually met from from
the local area that would explain why it
got here so fast
and what is in here except the note
aside for a second so it came in an 8
gigabyte package of memory but there's
no memory in there and instead is a
package within a package of some CPUs so
we have here an i5 6 5 5 k 6 55 k 2008
era Intel Core i5 we can definitely make
use of that the that was around when
Intel started making big pushes through
first gen III series processors or core
series processors and then also an FX
8350 which can go with the 83-70 you
know what I want to figure out is for
some of these do we want to deal in some
of the newer CPUs that are littered in
that we have multiple of and make art
out of the IHS a--'s or out of the bear
substrate and silicon I don't know that
could be kind of cool to rather than
just mounting all the CPUs as is so that
might be kind of cool let me know what
you think I guess in the comments we'll
keep an eye on it and Ryan is in there
moderating a few if you want to send a
note he'll see it
good luck Ryan there'll be a lot of them
now all right so I'm looking at chat
trying to look at at everything all at
once there's there's a lot going on
right now but we have plenty more to go
through
so first of all for chat evacuate now
nothing can survive a cat 5 I know is
that thing up to cat 5 already left I
have two cats so it's really the
difference is only three I guess I can
probably take it okay do you see the
window over there
oh you see the cats the yes the the
snowflake and midnight representations
in the office sent over by our patreon
backers lovingly thank you to the
patreon backers for those all right so
yeah no I think we'll be fine thank you
very concerned
we're in lend a bit so by the time it
gets here it'll have to destroy the
Outer Banks first and that's that's what
they were there for
and the we got a thank you note or a
note as well from from Matt who was
local and sent along the 655 K said that
it was the first prong or the the first
one he sent over was a 655 K comes from
the first computer I ever built for
myself back in 2010 it was never ever
clocked but served well through several
iterations of that build slowly
transitioning from a gaming PC to a
network storage device perfect he is for
an old PC by the way and the other one
is an 80 through 50 which was the first
processor I purchased in 2015 for
overclocking specifically i'ma just hit
4.9 gigahertz with it pretty damn good
not bad for my first attempt at
overclocking unfortunately it overheated
significantly when my H 100 i GTX failed
this june and became unstable even
before gigahertz ouch a good processor
that served me well well thank you very
much and we we certainly appreciate the
the history I'm sorry for your processor
and its untimely demise next one is
going to be from Rob from Michigan I
think that's what those letters stand
for no no other country is better than
the states in the US alright so Rob what
did you send over try and try not to cut
too deep with this for good reason
apparently alright so you got some notes
this is someone I had a Twitter
conversation with it looks like and Rob
said previously on Twitter I love your
show in content to support your desire
for wall art I'm sitting hey Pentium 2
your way thank you rob let's check out
let's check out the stuff you can use
that for something to you alright so
these are our well packaged and
potentially still functional that would
be potentially cool I do kind of want to
work with some of this stuff once all is
said and done if any of it is still
alive so what there you go there's the
first part and what is it oh man real 3d
check that out get a zoom in on that if
you've been waiting for raytrace and I
have the next big thing for you
it's real 3d and actually there's some
history to this so if if you're not too
familiar with the way graphics were done
in the past there were 2d cards and 3d
cards I suppose this was a 3d card it's
got VGA on it and it says real 3d and I
I might have to read the note to know
exactly what this is because I did not I
did not use whatever this product was so
I will check them out the the note
momentarily then the next one should be
the Pentium 2 or at least a part of it
someone says it basically intel graphics
card ok well there you go
so if you you're waiting until 2020 for
Intel's graphics we got it way before
you that's right there according to the
comments anyway alright so here you go
coolermaster hey there's the back when
coolermaster branded their OEM products
for Intel so if you don't know this is
some some fun fun information for you
cooler master presently makes I think
all except for the liquid coolers all of
the Intel stock coolers and the AMD
stock coolers and it was ASA tech who
made many of the liquid coolers the
closed-loop liquid coolers for like the
FX 9000 series but cooler master in fact
makes many of the Iroquois and looks
like that's been true for a long time I
did not know that so even back to the
pentium ii which is here cooler master
was was making the coolers for intel
products and you can see maybe just
barely if we got the camera angle right
we'll try the dust has been pretty well
cleaned out by the way thank here so you
can let's see let me try and get this
orient into the camera can see it may be
down there you might be able to see the
actual cpu between the PCB and the
cooler can you see that Andrew
yeah maybe so you might be able to see
that and that is a very cool part that's
definitely deserving on our wall we got
some I guess I'll she have a break from
own I will show it and between packages
I think that's everything
oh there's one more thing this here's
one yes one more thing damn it there you
go gambits thank you it was that was
that robbed that was robbed Z thank you
rob rob Z sent over a gambit picture as
well with the processors so what we got
and I'll bring this over I suppose was
just a couple of shadow boxes for now so
you can see one in the background of the
set for the silicon wafer and we're
going to so I have some core memory
coming in if anyone knows knows of the
Computer History Museum in Mountain View
California we did a tour there
previously and showed core memory it's
actually really neat just because it's a
bunch of copper wires all inter woven
and this is what we're planning to use
just to frame the core memory when that
comes in system so one of you is sending
over some core memory I think it's gonna
be like a 5 by 5 or 6 by 6 piece of
hardware that should be really cool in
there it's it's an old old technology
that'll look great on the wall and
that's I mean we bought just shadow
boxes for a lot of this stuff so anyway
let me read through some of the comments
gambits F yeah I agree thank you for the
gambit picture that is gambit was uh was
definitely my favorite back when I
watched the x-men cartoons next one so
comments we got a lot of super chats in
we have good amount of store purchases
I'm going to do my best to get through
everyone hopefully the stream still
going well though in terms of audio and
everything because this is our first
test of this stuff but yeah so Steve
have companies like Andy or Intel ever
made CPU Anatomy style posters something
long lines of your Anatomy posters that
phrasing was awkward I don't know I
think I had some ideas so we might do
one of our own but definitely they exist
yeah I think I think stone has some and
so we might be able to get some from our
from one of the guys who works with us
Patrick stone you've probably seen him
in the movie logs and he has some old
posters that are technical diagrams Bach
diagrams stuff like that so I'm hoping
to get some of those that we can bring
in here as well and next one let's see I
I'm so behind on the super chats I think
the next one is probably from loss
loathe allele loss see his twenty
dollars eat something healthy like r-tx
it will keep you going another two years
hahaha not a real potato five dollars
buy a potato
pío d8 EoE the change shall be converted
to Canadian pennies and mixed with
American pennies thank you not a real
potato shilling your own species I guess
Richard Walden $20 to heck with snacks
grab you and your guys a sixer love your
work thank you Richard
Eric Hebert's our average 25 dollars you
should bring a mountain bike in flowers
and mounted on one of your walls even if
we only see part of it from the edge of
the frame on occasion if we ever do more
with the side channel on the bike in
front of things then perhaps we'll build
out some kind of special set for it but
it'd probably be in a different location
next one's from Specter and by the way
I've received I need to reply to them
but I received an email from two people
at bike mountain bike companies lately
so we may be able to work with with some
of them on some kind of content on the
side channel or something Specter 333
yeah it's a hairy stream Steve okay Nora
very two dollars I've seen it all Steve
contemplating making art in all caps
alright I'm gonna pause there for a
second let's do the next one I need to
make some space at this point if you
missed the beginning by the way I think
we have like 1500 more people watching
minor
that that's it's pretty damn cool I
talks about it already I won't go
through it again
but the wafer was a worked on with great
care by Patrick today and unfortunately
the shipper via via eBay shipped it in a
flat paper envelope and it was folded by
the loop by shipping company at least
once or twice it's really the shippers
fault for honest so it is cracked but
there are parts of it that are in great
condition the bottom laughs pretty damn
good middle pieces are pretty good and
the rest of it I it's a it's an abstract
view of what happens to the silicon
market I guess I don't know it's all
fractured and shattered looks cool up
next let's move these aside and then get
to the next set of items also I showed
some AMD posters earlier from one of you
all viewer who sent them in so next one
that's a shadow box let's do a do one of
these this is oh yeah this is I think
was a gift like an Amazon gift someone
just sent in straight from Amazon so
does it have a note send a thank-you
note I'll just I mean thank you whoever
sent it that have an actual note a gift
for you the bits are met but take
standard bits good for low profile stuff
like CPU coolers for science in all caps
so thank you for sending that along I
guess they the the user and I don't
think your name is on here purchase us a
ratcheting driver that will be actually
very good for 90-degree angles so I
don't know if this is a result of our
moving vlogs but we did have a few
instances where we needed some tighter
angles on things and the standard
screwdrivers we have here presently
we're not good enough and the ratcheted
handles I have or too fat so this
actually does look like it will be
pretty useful and I very much appreciate
it and I also appreciate you letting me
know that the bits are met because I'd
probably have some better ones we can
definitely use the tool and I'll give
the bits a try anyway thank you for
saying that along
next thing is the closest thing the 2000
view watch and are going to get to an
unboxing from us by the way so enjoy it
this one is from let's see armchair guru
from is that North Carolina I think that
is also a a local armchair guru it's a
great thing to be a guru of these days
as evidenced by our common section let's
let's there that's fine what we've got
we have small surface mount devices
spilling out of the box so there's a
service mount device there's a surface
mount device there's some solder joints
there's some solder joints we have a
couple of like resistors and capacitors
that's well I mean whatever whatever
that was f to pay respects
can I get could I get an f to pay
respects in Chapel ease holy crap this
is our this is a lot of stuff just like
a a loose loads LGA socket Norwell
attention to kit okay there's a lot of
smalls there's mount devices on my table
right now hopefully none of them fell
into my that's my drink we're gonna move
that side so what were these oh well
this one took some serious damage up in
that corner what were these let me check
on chat house chat doing I I'm a little
worried for chat right now it's probably
a lot for them to go through a lot of
F's in chat yes so to be fair we did ask
for old and potentially broken CPUs so I
don't think this is like they didn't
know how to ship it
I think it's that it's it's probably
well I don't know that's an awful lot of
CPUs to be dead but they are now so
anyway these and what are these what
made this great sacrifice 2006 era 8400
Core 2 Duo for that one actually
remember that one
well and can you see that stuff okay
Andrew and we had or should I should I
hold it up more we have an i7 920 there
you go
I have a nine sy7 930 I think it is d4
stepping I want to say one of the better
first gen I sevens so 97 920 he's right
up there I hope it still works cuz this
is actually a CPA still we have a 934
benching if we need it but it would be
cool have a 920 available I don't know
we'll have to test it or something see
see if any of them survived this one did
not it is missing parts anyway I'll glue
it on we have glue here Oh a md-88 6500
series that is a scratched up by HS if
I've ever seen one but makes it cooler
because it has been through how since
that's a 2011 part from Andy not not too
old on that one this one Intel 8400 man
this person bought a lot of CPUs 2006
8400 series Intel CPU this is another
same series I believe yep II 7500 Core 2
Duo just go through all of them here oh
man that is some good damage on this one
I'll show you that in a second I can
barely read this I 3 2120 this out how's
that for an IHS see if you can even even
get the light to reflect off all those
scratches
there's your there is your problem
to quote Adam Savage yes someone said
tech support Gore go ahead and
screenshot the pile or actually
screenshot what's coming up next for
tech support Gore you can take all the
reddit points for that one this is an
Intel Core i3 2120 as well this this
person really did not like the 2120 is
because check out the corner of that LGA
padding there that is not thrown pasted
that's just a chip of the substrate gone
so adding adding to the editing to the
value the
historical value anyway oh this very
cool left in their lap it and it will be
good as new I think that was for the
previous one but you know this one we
can we I don't I don't know we can we
can maybe put it in a frame I don't know
that it's ever going in a computer again
a couple of loose screw torque screws
and what are the cards there storm out
there I on so apparently I'm being told
there's a storm outside this might be
our last live stream ever will be fine I
have two cats at home it's only a cat
five we already went over this I don't
know what this is this is a revision ao2
of whatever it is what is the product do
i how easy is this to take off the
heatsink
that's pretty glue it in there so I'm
not positive what this is if you I'll
have to have to like take it apart and
look at the the chip under there but if
you know what this is let me know
because I don't I'll check the box i
don't know that i don't think they
specified and i contrary to popular
belief do not know what everything ever
made is so if you know what those are
let me know and chat because i am very
curious and i think I can hear the storm
someone says alright yeah so i don't
know what those are someone says it
looks like an old mattress matrix-matrix
video card that'd be pretty cool cuz i
dont have any if it is but i can hazard
a guess geforce MX looks like an ATI
Radeon the next two hundred so someone
says r-tx 2080 a 1080i so anything made
between now and thirty years ago that's
what that is
thanks chat I'll take off the yes that's
something I can just do right now maybe
I can do that right now
I mean all the service mount devices
already fell off how much worse can we
really make it at this point so it's got
some pins Live's here down there you go
push that through oh I think it's
probably how that's mounted one second
we're doing surgery on a corpse uh okay
there we go and it's got thrown paste on
it I need I need to see if I can clean
this off so we can identify this
properly cuz chat gave me about a
thousand options of what it might be
that's too high
alright let's see what it is
g-force 8600 storm come in to get gambit
back that's a good one that's a very
good one well well done sir alright that
was a reference by the way for those who
just join into someone's tend to say
gambit picture rubbing alcohol not
working to remove the adhesive that this
has become Tim I don't know what it is
though
this is really really on there I'm
starting to see some letters feel more
like a palm reader than a technician
right now though don't I I can't read it
it's too it's too hardened and turned
into glue dan that is very close to
legible though let's let's try a little
more I might be able to get this might
be able to get this legible all right so
it says ati eighty i Radeon who said who
said Radeon you're correct so far but
what is the part number it's like a
mystery mystery product from the viewers
what is the part number
it's your ad on something so we have any
guesses any guesses in chat before I
finalize cleaning this off take your
guests now you will win nothing I might
get a shout out if I see it in time
someone says rage rage 128 Radeon 4096
hundred thirty five sixty 1600 X 80 550
460 that is a lot of guesses literally
their entire product line could be in
this in this chip right here that's
upside down
that's so close to being legible what is
it need to know there's a magnifying
glass if we lose power Internet there's
a storm outside we'll be fine
Larry that's much better uh well it is
PCI Express so it's not ancient ancient
can't I don't see a Product ID
I see everything else made in Taiwan so
another store or the origin which is not
not surprising a little bit more work I
must know what it is where's the office
locator on the East Coast near the
hurricane that caused every single
product and the grocery store to sell
out as they do okay I'm gonna read this
off because there's no product ID well
that might be one but it's exceptionally
tiny Danny I can oh I think that is a
300 that is extremely small it's like I
think there's an axe and I think it says
300 and then there's two numbers below
it that I can't make a hat but it does
look like X 300 let me look this one up
let's see if that that person was right
ATI Radeon X 300 SE maybe maybe it's a
seed that looks like a maybe yeah that's
it I think it is a I think it is an X
300 not sure if it's an se but damn good
damn good guess whoever called that damn
good that is impressive well done it was
who is that Dave Greene was that Dave
Greene well done Dave Greene who called
it I think we have two of them here so
very cool anyway 2 X 3 hundreds I think
with a bunch CBS we already went through
and a pile of surface mount devices that
came off of the CPUs and ship in
rip alright so a really cool stuff let's
move on to the next one
make sure there's no no notes or
anything just gonna put all this stuff
over here
okay so we're against the clock as the
storm races to kill us all according to
some people in chat
I put the Box down I heard another
service mad device fall out of it we
already went through that one need to
make sure you take the stuff out of
there okay next one Christian from
Pennsylvania sent over a package as well
thank you for the soon-to-be wall art
perhaps it even has some some of the
componentry still on it one of the white
stickers may say something now regarding
it found a picture of that card yes x
300 s ii found it at tech parts
warehouse okay cool
there you go so that's what it was that
was fun there
fun fun mystery part so we have some
styrofoam this is a good sign and it
might even have a product inside of it
oh that might be Ram I think that is
might be a CPU that's painters tape we
can just pull that off
except it's stuck to the styrofoam so
what is this is from Christian from
Pennsylvania sent this along and while I
finish unwrapping this I'll get to the
super chats in a moment thank you for
sending them in and also on this this is
like sticking to me everywhere the store
has a coupon code of do it live you can
use it anytime during the stream it
should be working I'll double check in a
second and that will give you 10% off of
any purchase on the stream or any
purchase on the store store doc gamers
XS not not during the stream and will
disable it until the next stream after
that if you if you want to pick
something up these look pretty cool so
what do we have
let me just pull the most immediately
accessible one this is an Intel Pentium
4
with the old intel drop a logo and I
can't quite read the part number Intel
Pentium 4 though for that one there are
two more we can pull out of here
this one is these are these are PGA by
the way this one is an Intel $19.99 I
almost said 2099 I'll be in tell us
quite a bit of head apparently 99 Intel
Pentium 3 that's cool so you got got
another one of the I don't know if we
have the Pentium 3 or not already yes so
we can figure out something to do with
Pentium 3 is because that's that's
pretty cool we've got a couple a couple
of those I adjust a little scrap that
scratched up on the other one and SMDs
are the next level floor Legos yes at
this point they might be ok they might
well be we've lost a couple of the fact
that he's being careful unboxing dead PC
junk is pure comedy what do you want for
me man I'm not careful with the people
are gonna be like Steve be more careful
because it's they always say oh and we
got a note from the previous users or a
sender as well so let me see what I can
read here I've included three CPUs for
your fan art project I really enjoy the
content you put out and rank you guys
the most detailed tech media group I
watch thank you very much
I enjoy the thought-out videos let's see
these CPUs are coming from my personal
collection but were doubles of other
CPUs so I felt that I could part with
them good that's that's what we're
looking for I don't want anyone to send
over stuff they don't feel like they can
part with I mostly get my CPUs and other
collected parts by scavenging old
computers that's pretty cool hobby but
these three have a bit of a story behind
them my Intel Pentium 550 II this is the
only CPU in the list that I personally
have not used it was pulled out of a
Dell Dimension L 866 r yes the Dell
dimensions I that worked on those at one
point we called them the Dementors and
that was from the summer camp that I
went through as a kid and then worked as
a staff member for many many years let's
see there are a couple other CPUs here
found two of these dowels and remove the
hard drives I was allowed to take the
computers home with me because I was
obsessed with the idea of a sleeper PC
that is a also a cool idea so they they
got together with friends and pulled
together a bunch of parts and put
together systems pretty cool story
another a couple other CPUs in there as
well
so next penny I'm for 2.2 gigahertz the
CPU as in the computer I learned how to
type on and other learning experiences
and si got an IBM net Vista at one point
to get acquainted with the internet
Internet's gone quite away since then
and then lastly the core i5 760 was in
the PC that got me back into desktop
computers in 2014 I bought one of the
computers at my college was selling and
they're replacing the computers of the
virtual pcs very cool thank for the
history and for the parts and we need to
to open another one of these here before
the storm kills us it's definitely gonna
happen Jame is from South Carolina keeps
far away I think they're getting hit a
little harder right now we've got some
loose parts okay alright if you look
carefully at the table there are some
CPUs on it and yeah some of them are in
various states of being alive all right
what is what is this stuff we had a okay
what I that's it James yes there we go
okay getting lost in all the CPUs
there's a couple more SMD is in there
gonna have enough that we can put them
in a bin and start a CPU repair business
you got builds wait out here
so what do we have here this one is
deleted clearly this is falling apart so
that's a deal it at CPU there's an i7
6700k hey that's actually still a modern
part did it survive the trip it looks
like it survived the trip it's got all
the all that some D's on it very cool
alright that's asking asking a lot from
what we've seen from
some of the delivery on these uh okay
there we go their own taste okay so
we've got a 6700 K that has been deleted
always cool to see people doing that in
the wild we have a 2005 era 5160 Xeon
that's pretty cool that's a frizzy on
I've opened from the Costa Rica fab and
then a or manufacturing assembly plant
and then a 2005 era 5160 Zeon cool maybe
a dual socket system or something I
don't know then what is the last one
that has actually been protected here
let's see what that is Steve your
Linkedin says you're speaking German I'm
not presently speaking German the next
one is I don't know what this is because
the IHS is gone but there's the next one
I might know if I want to remove that or
not but that's that's next CPU it's been
pretty deleted it is PGA and I'm not
positive what this one is okay so let's
get 300 super chats it's been a few in
the wild Steve Irwin over here yes yes I
am The Steve Irwin of wild CPUs all
right
builds wide would have it be a CPU
destroyer not a repair
might be someone accurate he's he's a
bit friendlier to GPUs in the
destruction category okay so let me try
and get through a couple super chats
there's been a lot of them so
how's it get on we're still alive look
I'm like that Ryan because he's
monitoring the livestream you hear it
mister we're all gonna die
everybody get your friends that unit
it's the last one
what's chat gonna say spooky yeah that's
pretty loud
you can't die Steve okay nice bit of fun
yes it is it is real Thunder it's not
even it's not even a special effect
steve has angered Thor I am Thor or hey
next time okay we got a couple super
chats here $5 Jasper you 182 you're
great Steve but thank you when is
snowflakes livestream we have footage of
her coming up I promised Richard Mack $5
love the content love the new office buy
pizza my guys we've got a list of things
from chat of what to buy
actual chats going crazy right now new
office nice career killed by storm press
f to pay respects a little getting a
little a little dramatic
is it ray-traced thunder Nvidia is
trying to do some some other stuff with
sound all right so we got a list of
quite a few things that were supposed to
eat after the stream according to Hall
few and fire on a wire eagerly awaiting
snowflakes review of the twenty atti
well we'll have her in there Irish giant
five dollars what cpu are you using
seriously though you should frame a 79
80 XE like a motivational poster a D
motivational poster perhaps five dollars
Nicolas Leon $5 every said that you know
I hope you were well we're doing okay
presently but we'll see if the storm
kills us Larry Schwartz $10 my first
computer had a z80 my first PC had an 80
88 very nice I'm 60 miles south of you
okay pretty cool the 8088
is a is definitely a chip worthy of note
SHM i me 350 ask AMD for some of that
cpu Chlo
yeah that already seal the
these in fixham all Donahoe toy $2.00 I
can send a non-functioning 60 energy T
interested I don't know we're not sure
on the on the GPUs yet but perhaps at
some point we will be doing something
with GPS Nordic gapper $5 here's $5 to
flex seal your windows Godspeed jeremy
e46 $2 want a Titan XP Jedi Shroud box
heatsink Titan X be Jedi if you mean
like the shroud and heatsink in the box
and you really don't need it then sure
we could do something with that only if
you don't need it though only if you
don't need it and don't want it I don't
want to don't want to take that from me
if you have any interest in keeping it
at at all also same person do dollars
also have you working BFG GTS 2250 if
you'd like yes
so BFG we have I've been considering
doing a a wall of rip or something like
that for company is that didn't quite
make it and BFG is of course one of
those I have a BFG power supply as well
data file $5 Steve stop lying you're not
Thor your PC Jesus
why not booth Jeffrey trip $2 where do
you feel safer your house or your new
office from that from like the Thunder I
think we're fine thank think we're out
we're all right to either location it's
Thunder Douglas that happen 399 if it
starts to flood please use Harwich
absorbent and last one I'll read for now
David Stoll $10 more flex seal yeah yeah
got to go out and buy some of that
apparently the the office has been
through a few stars they should be fine
it's everything's fine
this is one that I think I can just kind
of cut through so who's this from Paul
from Illinois who is sending something
gonna set background
listen knife is very dull
No okay so you've got nine lives soft
streets I don't think that's think about
opening snowflakes mail right now pretty
sure that's illegal
nice life's hot treats and we have some
components so what did Paul from
Illinois send I've got an eye doc fan
anyone know night act the makers of
gentle typhoon fans very famous ones
Riley he's the most commonly used one
there a lot of variants of that fan and
I'm not positive what this goes to but
perhaps if we continue opening the box
of stuff we'll find out though say it's
a CPU fan oh here we go
AMD Athlon box and the Athlon processor
1999 assembled in the USA the highest
highest mark of honour putting it
together not making it and then also the
PCB so let's see what let's see what it
is got a couple more super chats all
three in a moment alright so what what
do we have K 75 it's an AMD part as a K
series part and I'm not positive I was
not building systems when these were
we're a thin yet so here you go take a
look at this one and wants to identify
it for us make sure make sure this is
visible socket a Athlon someone's asking
yes a few people saying slot AF on okay
thank you very much for the
clarification that's pretty cool
CPU cartridge insides for the for the
rest of it so it's a cebu cartridge
Athlon chips latte and being told
someone saying def not socket a well
okay so now chat now chats fighting
hahaha it's an Athlon you were looking
at slot processor
WTF oh there we go we got an actual
answer here k75 50 megahertz Thank You
k75 50 megahertz I'm being told by
Picard 2005 they did it to copy Intel's
slot is that one or I have on yes okay
so we have a lot of lot of involvement
from chat you have the full kit three
build it if you got the screws I mean
I'm sure if he'd if the if you didn't
send a Milan I'm sure we can get screws
I know we might try and see if we can
like get one of these working because
that's pretty cool
so k7 550 is what I'm being told and I
don't know we'll see we'll see if we can
do anything with some of these older
ones other than just put them on the
wall or maybe put them on the wall and
in a fashion that is retrievable because
I think we can actually use this
assuming it's functional and I don't
know if it isn't that but we can find
out with a couple more parts okay so
that one thank you very much Paul from
Illinois that is an awesome thing to
send along oh we got a note maybe it'll
say if it works or not
so Paul sent a note let me see what this
is not Paul s hardware it is Paul from
Illinois to Steve Patrick Michael the
other Patrick Keegan Michael or whoever
decides to open this box hi if you
didn't see the CPU earlier it is special
this is my first Andy CPUs I would try
my first PC in 1999 eseries IBM apt IVA
do not worry though it is not too
horribly sentimental to me I've had it
for about 19 years and for 12 of them it
has been sitting around acting as a
decoration I did dig up my old PC and it
still works nice ok cool maybe we can do
some content with this one thank you for
for the content peace I'll have to
figure out what else we need to buy from
that area for compatibility but I'm sure
we can do it I mean of course the CPU
still works the sound card has kicked
the bucket my old video too is glitching
the heck out and the IBM motherboard is
probably going to bust a cap soon so I
do not want to use anyway fair enough
once I heard that you guys were thinking
about making a CPU wall on Twitter I
immediately thought of my k7 since it's
just laying around collecting dust who
better to give it to than tech jeez
well you guys will probably get a kick
out of it more or possibly even use it
more than I will from now on so inside
the box is a k7 550 the stock lid shroud
thing heatsink and the pathetic looking
50 millimeter high tech fan I'm quoting
here I have already on shroud of the CPU
and in the process made a blood
sacrifice to the PC gods as one does you
might want to put a info on the CPU it
goes if you want to put info with it it
goes as follows
so it's from from Paul who it goes by
equina Star beat and the processor is an
AMD Athlon k7 550 it's a slot a socket
and it's a 184 square millimeter sized
one core one thread clock speed 550
megahertz processor no 250 nanometers
and usage gaming and Microsoft Office
overclock none may your frame rates be
high and your temperature is low thank
you very much
at real equid very much appreciated that
is an awesome processor for us to play
around with and apparently it still
works so I've set that one aside let me
set it even more aside in fact just to
make sure it doesn't get mixed up so
that we can try and see if we can
acquire parts to do something with it
we'll go over on the set table okay
we're not dead yet from the store how is
it is it still storming outside not
really okay if we could get it back that
makes it more dramatic and I think that
would be better for views so if you
could just get on that that would be
great
not raining but it is thundering okay
well you won't see me die today let's
see what oh well I mean I guess he's
still good I am flailing a knife around
next one what's what is this this is
from servant access F aka Vega from our
patreon group Thank You servant good to
hear from you so serpent sent along
presumably some products but also a
screenshot of a submission on it looks
like hardware bot so this is for at
least this this overclock was an Intel
Core 2 Duo 63 20 at 3.1 5 gigahertz and
it is a see it was clocked yes 3.15
multiplier x7 apparently bus P and 550
or sorry 4 or 50 megahertz and a rated
FSB 1800 megahertz so that's the the
specs for it
the food is belong in a museum they are
history ok so I've got a lot of comments
to read through to but ok so serpent
says please don't read the text below on
camera only above text ok gif TW LGA 775
motherboard Intel OBS says this stream
died it says it's back now is it is it
back yeah it's back ok do the lights
flicker yeah ok weird I think we're back
are we back apparently it's back ok I'm
not dead yet I mean I was asking for
more Thunder I didn't want it to like
cause problems trying to try to work
here
so anyway serpent sent along some pretty
cool stuff 790i FTW LGA 775 is a light
flickering oh that lights dead that's
making it seem much more bad than it
is let me just turn that light the
overhead light is freaking out okay okay
so Core 2 Duo ATI Radeon 2400 XT and
achieved an overclock 3.2 gigahertz only
on air cool and of course nothing
record-breaking but wanted to share I
hope you find it you can find it at home
the ebj board unfortunately is missing a
pin for when my son was rebuilding the
system I appreciate all the hard work
you guys do and look forward to meeting
you guys one day at PAX East we'll
probably be there again and whenever
that is March April
you never oh you never tested m2 temps
and an SFF case where the m2 nvme drive
is on back of an ITX board you are
correct and that is something yes that
that we would I don't know it's if we
have time it's an interesting idea my
wife wanted to send it you hair products
but I told her you're sponsored don't
hate it
well she's got a link up with a hair
product company I guess
let's see what's what was sent along
then got an ATI card all these were just
detailed a moment ago but we're gonna
have to clean up anyway I guess I'll
throw that down there ATI card what is
what's in here what's the tiny part that
the CPU that's the CPU protected of
course that's good so this is the 2005
era Core 2 Duo that I already detailed
that was listed in the hardware bot
listing stream still going ok cool
alright 240p here someone says it's not
stuck in 240p is it ok so chat someone
in chat is saying everyone who's
watching has to click 1080p60 again you
can switch back to 1080p apparently
we're still streaming just switch to
1080p 60 in the bottom right corner you
should be good to go so to switch in the
bottom right corner click the settings
click the resolution you want ok so
that's the part thank you servant for
sending that along we've got the ATI
card and a pretty
toasted look in order these called IO
shield I never use them so I just forget
what they called IO shields for the back
seriously toasted and then the card
itself ATI Radeon graphics check out
that fan so I got a fan on that thing
it's got like seven blades nice pretty
cool alright ah
is it a networked or in the agenda for
the office not presently we don't we're
not really doing anything special with
it other than making it work but we did
like a video of showing showing how we
connected the cat6 and stuff like that
but that was about where that stop and
there is the EVGA motherboard in here as
well which I I noted is missing a
capacitor unfortunately and it looks
like it is extremely packed so I'm not
gonna open this right now it'll take me
a while but there's the EVGA motherboard
FTW board alright and someone says top
right if you're on the phone so if you
want to adjust your settings for the
stream after did crash from the
presumably lightning or something check
the top right for the phone or bottom
right for desktop okay gotta stir making
room
I think we're getting through a lot of
these at this point we have a couple
left and I need to read super chats to
get Linus to hook you up with a 45 Drive
server that is it's a bit much but if
you wanted to fly out I'd do it okay
next one it's in terms of super chat
anyway so we've got more flex seal read
that one WC turn $2 the real question is
what CPU is it which which one there are
that's not a CPU there are a few dishes
from Jeremy e46 $2 i water-cooled it so
I don't need it I'll send both oh that's
from the the parts we were talking about
earlier Thank You Jeremy center- 499
quick take this before you die any
thoughts on cloud game
game streaming as a low ish cost
alternative to in-home gaming tech PCs
and consoles I think it's really
interesting I think the what did they
call it grid and video called it grid
and now they call it GeForce now I don't
know about their specific version of it
the pricing was a bit not great well it
was sort of first debuted but the idea
is interesting and what I am curious to
see is if as cable companies continue to
struggle to provide relevance especially
to a to an to an audience that is
growing apart from cable and just moving
all the internet and I look at YouTube
and its growth I think that there's a
potential for on-demand gaming and that
could be done with things like GeForce
now or whatever the cable companies
decide to attempt to develop probably
poorly on their own so it's it's a very
interesting future for that stuff I
don't think it's there today the latency
is not great for a lot of like FPS type
games but definitely interested in the
tech one black ice one $10 love the
channel all this old hardware is giving
me a nostalgia trip storm
notwithstanding how is North Carolina
was thinking of moving out to that area
well if you came out here today it would
look like I don't know fallout or
something they're sort of uh there's
nothing left on the shelves at stores
and the gas station had cars spilling
onto the street in all directions and
that that's what you get today so
otherwise it's not a bad area okay let
me read like couple more actually oh
there you go yeah of course
Christopher $10 the more you buy the
more you rate race the more you buy the
more you rage race you heard it here
first ladies and gentlemen that's my
that's my Nvidia CEO impression that's
that's what he says okay so we've got a
couple more boxes here and a couple more
super chats and things like that let's
let's go to let's see this one next
la AR law from San Antonio Texas try not
to cut anything inside the box just
couple more of these and while I'm
opening this if you missed it it's okay
it was a an extension cable packaging
piece if you missed it earlier we have a
code on the store right now let me
double check that that's working
actually that is do it live you can use
for ten percent off of anything you
order on the store during the live
stream and let me just make sure it's
it's functional it is working okay cool
a lot of you have used it thank you very
much for that so use the code do it live
if you want to get ten percent off of
anything on stored I Kara's exits not
net including our mugs which we've
recently restocked the I think there are
15 ounce mugs with the GN tear down logo
on them so we've got those in stock now
it does not come with the dead Corsair
memory modules that are in it
unfortunately for you but that is on the
store what was in this box I see a bag
of CPUs gamers Nexus the enclosed CPUs
were pulled from some old dolls that I
purchased in a computer a lot which had
one thing I really wanted and then these
old things
thanks price was good for just the one
item I wanted so I ended up with these
as well I was just going to recycle but
you've asked for processors so here they
are I hope that these processors can
find new life in your art project and
the the name here we go 10 or is the
1000 are is the alias for the user so
thank you for sending that along let's
see what it is they are quote these old
things from the from the Dell computers
that were purchased in a big lot for
some other item some mysterious item we
don't know what it is okay and it is
quite a few of them I think it's five
looks like five CPUs see this is where
I'm starting to think like maybe we
could do an IHS wall or a substrate wall
or a die wall or something like that let
me know if you have ideas and chat of
what we can deal with a huge amount of
old Seabee is that we have and what are
these this is 2006 era
yiii 7,500 core2duo
for that one and then I think it's
probably gonna be a bunch of those nope
2005 a 2200 dual core Pentium what's
this
Oh 5q 6700 there you go I represent the
Q Series and oh for Pentium 4 there's
one more here this one still got a mark
from the stock Intel cooler on it
there's a circle imprinted on the IHS
this is an O six Q 8400 I remember that
one as well very cool so thank you 1000
for those and let's let's let's I don't
know do some maybe some super chats or
something no please
five dollars I'm not a real potato is
back no potato P o ta t OE no potato
peelers on your store so thanks but no
thanks
PS my mother and girlfriend love your
hair please cell locks in the store so
we don't have potato peelers so you say
no but you'll take hair it's very very
interesting we got another one here
what's what's the next Super chat guys
hakkim 5 euros says it's our new Excel
Nora oh dude oh it's pricks yeah Nora I
envisioned Deutsch but it was very
useful when we were in Germany
communicating with some of the cab
drivers Albert Nora I envisioned good
skin ook mitts their Bauer okay next one
Christopher we got that one the more you
buy the more you race race of course
general t interested interested in a
ceramic CPU CX and Pentium Pro etc
definitely interested in those
especially psychics and next one couple
more Super chats here
bama's contrary $5 I sent a tweet with
hardware I've pulled out of computers in
the past couple of months I'm pretty
sure I have some BFG GTX cards okay I'll
try to catch them on Twitter I saw there
were a lot of tweets with old hardware
in there I need to need to try and do my
best to catch up on it but it's hundreds
of them gauge Lindell $2.00 is a network
Toro in the agenda for the office not
presently perhaps in the future and data
file telling everyone to increase the
resolution manually if they hadn't
already and then we got a $2 donation
can you t pose for five seconds Andrew
what could go wrong with them what is
the what is the motive for a tipo is for
five seconds I'm being told you could
three scan me and turn me into a model
doing a Poe is how an APO is near palms
facing out and there's the 3d x-ray okay
there you go hahaha xvl bullet $2 will
Intel beat the 2990 WX in October I
don't know I'm not sure we'll see what
comes of that 28 core part I'm really
curious now no idea though okay so it's
just a couple more mister me $5 did you
guys use real rate racing for the GM
logo on your merch I only want it if it
has if it's been real time rate race we
did rate race although not in real time
I think a race to write the intro
animation that's ready traced in all the
videos where we have that into second
intro that's rate race but it was
rendered and it was about two weeks off
of being real-time okay let me do one
one more stupid chat we'll move on
Spencer
wit $2 use the CPUs to make pixel art
that's actually kind of a cool idea I
like that that's an interesting one we
do pixel art of the GM logo what do you
think of that hat you don't think we
have enough we need more apparently I
like that idea actually only two more
super chaps let me just do these elf boy
$5 I've got an old Andy CPU I'll be
sending from back when they were good
ouch the first time around very cool
they've made quite a recovery
Steven IRL $5 this is Steven with the
AMD posters did you get the CPUs and the
letter as well where's that tube oh
there is something in there which side
is open other side is open so thank you
for sending the note in we would have
caught it eventually but might as well
get it on stream there are CPUs very
cool I don't know if he caught it
earlier because I was very early in the
stream but we did show the posters we
framed them already Steven hey Steve I
have sent you over some of my old CPUs
that I had to just buy it in bald I hope
you can use some of these for your wall
art project alive in the new office
can't wait to see what you do with all
the CPUs appreciate the great content
looking forward to more thank you very
much for the kind note and here's the
package I just pulled out so let's see
where is this taped I need to read some
comments to I'm sure but those can wait
for a moment
so this is from the the same person who
sent over those Andy posters I showed
early on on the stream that we've
already frames we frame them today went
out and bought some push frames for
those and wow there are a lot of CPUs in
here okay Andrew we might be getting
close to enough for pixel art of the GM
logo I do think that would be really
cool
I don't think this is all of them either
so PG a part what is this and the Athlon
and 2007 and the Athlon ouch some of
those pins got a little hurt what is
this
it is recoverable though Athlon 64
that's what I want to see 2001 as I said
earlier Athlon 64
revolutionary part in the CPU world and
if you I did say this earlier but if you
ever wanted
up on PC history or just learn more
about pcs I would highly recommend the
old Anand Chimpy Athlon 64 review on an
attack comm he did a great job detailing
that one I read that one semi recently
just to to update myself on things a 450
300 series and this one is so pasted up
I don't know if I can read it it is an
intel part but it is covered in the
remnants of thermal paste or some other
thermal interface so there you go we got
the parts now Steven thank you I do see
that there's another one or two in there
well three that are stuck to the bubble
wrap and making making terrible noises
with screech scratching one more come on
there's one one more there's one more in
here the Athlon 64 I'm I'm pretty
excited about it because I do want to
figure out something to do with that one
as a special standalone piece maybe
frame it or something I know and what is
this aim the Sun prong there you go
2009 AMD sempron running out of space um
even on the GN mod Matt found on stored
a cameras Nexus done that okay so thank
you for sending those thanks for
notifying me that we almost missed them
we have one two three four I think left
to go through and whatever super chats
are left and plenty of store orders
thank you for sending the for ordering
during the storm no less if we survive
it will be not as exciting content some
stuff wrapped in newspaper what's this
hello GN this is from Joe and see Joe
says I hope the transition into the new
offices going well it is certainly
certainly getting easier we had a couple
of zeon 2800 DP is sitting around from a
decommission 2003 application server
that I thought you could use for the
wall thank you be careful with these
things at a top speed of what is that
2.8
on their single-core they might be too
much to handle
yes they 2.8 is pretty high honor that's
they might even say 2.0 I have also
included an old Athlon and an old Phenom
in the event you need to take up some
some more wall space thank you very much
Joe let's see what it is I guess you
told us what it is let's see what they
look like very very carefully wrapped on
you okay we got that make sure there's
nothing in there
yes so here's the first ones we have one
two three boxes left up to this and then
the other stuff to go through from super
chat and everything and then the storm
will kill us all so these are these are
actually pretty cool looking so these
are the Zeon's from 2001 from the
application server decommissioned
application server these were used in
cool to have the history there always
appreciate that are they the same part I
think they are the same part there's two
of those check out that design this
should look pretty cool for the wall I
think and I'll check what I would chat
saying in a moment we have so many bent
pins on this table right now it's it's
very sad but I think many of these were
not functional and the Phenom part so
the Phenom we recently retest the Phenom
2 x6 I want to say and by recently I
mean about a year ago but that is fairly
recent and that was a an excellent
performer did better than bulldozer when
it launched and then an Athlon part here
from when is this 2005 so thank you for
those Joe much appreciated we can find a
spot for them on the wall certainly ok
let me catch up on chat let's chat up to
you other than more ray-tracing jokes
and some super chats
let's see intel doesn't have a good
technology for doing it i don't know
what conversation has jumped into the
middle of but it sounds like most of
them on the internet when it comes to
hardware bulldozer it was so bad that's
it's a heartbreaking comment
okay I love the opening the mail stream
once I'm back home from business travel
I'll have to send us a few things your
way GN yeah I mean like I said consider
it you're one of your only opportunity
to get an unboxing video out of us but
we owe it to all cuz these are these are
pretty awesome thank you for sending
stuff along and let's just okay so some
more people suggesting GN logos out of
the stuff
okay last couple here this one has a lot
of broken surface mount devices on it
from one of the boxes that shiftin sadly
was the end for for some of the
processors in there so that box will be
open last and this one is wrapped
everywhere they're a box cutter
somewhere I don't know where why is it
on the table okay box cutter
where's he opening it is it's it's just
paper that's been wrapped now it's one
of those shipping envelopes that's what
it is okay there we go
it's a box inside of a box what will it
be who is it from
this is from Jay not that one from
Oregon Jay it would probably send a bin
full of trash liquid clean parts that
are unusable just to get rid of them
okay we're getting closer to opening
this Gian box cutter coming soon that's
not true there will not be a GN box
cutter it's not trying to be a gender
guys relax GN is 100 miles away from
shore he's not going to die yes that is
I mean not as a result of this
particular storm anyway but perhaps
perhaps when the end times come and I do
die we will we will all look back and
feel regret for how long we've lived
with our lives not having been ray
traced that's definitely what's going to
happen this is a huge box TVs and some
cool actual original boxing this was an
AMD sempron 1200 processor box but the
amd64 technologies look at the marketing
language of the day has it changed
performance for everyday computing
that's that's what I want everyday
computing limited or 3-year warranty and
the might still be under note maybe not
AMD qualified heatsink and fan included
is their marketing language on us
because that's what I really want to see
reliable computing experience that the
font colors change a lot your simple
computing experience that delivers a
responsive performance on thousands of
applications amd64 technology listed
again cool and quiet they're still using
that when was this printed where's the
copyright date Oh 2006 okay so it's not
cool and quiet though we're still being
news then going quiet technology can
help minimize heat and noise for a
better working and play an environment
enhance the virus protection okay I mean
I don't know the specter effects I guess
one variant of a Spectre effect of this
one but I melt down so perhaps they are
correct than that
and these Sempron processors are the
smart combination of value and
performance to meet the needs of budget
conscious customers
okay well let's see what they look like
I think that's mold I'm pretty sure
that's small
I just put that right there for a second
alright so what is this this is a pretty
cool looking one PGA and the part oh
it's actually got text on it what is it
what are you and the upside down
AMD Doron era I can't read what
specifically it is let's say 1999 so
what that says anyway there's the part
make sure I'm not hitting buttons on the
keyboard
Steve needs a monocle yes detective PC
Jesus it's our new animated series
coming soon
detective PC Jesus another one another
AMD door on this one much more legible
1999 yes that is when they were made
it's got that that purple PCB and a
couple other parts in here as well okay
we've got one there that would still see
all the one there that still sealed
the quantity one couple quite a few CPUs
in here let me check the note actually
there was a note with this one and it
probably details what all of them are J
I've been building AMD based pcs since
1999 very cool i herded sheep from 92
from 1974 it's 1999 awesome that is one
of the most unique backgrounds we
received today at that year I went back
to Community College to retrain an
information technology very respectable
I took computers like a duck takes to
what it took to computers like a duck
takes water my passion was putting the
PC I built to work doing web design and
development and graphic art some of
these CPUs must go back to then I've
never thrown one away I've been going to
recycle them an Oregon 34 miles away but
never said today Hayes or he's been
meaning to do that never said today is
the day I have the motherboards for them
in original boxes along with DDR ddr2
ram I need to recycle I've never owned
an Intel processor I've rooted for the
underdog AMD and look what they have
given me now Rison I have ended up with
nine Rison based pcs of all sizes and
configurations I've built it's a hobby
of mine I vote gaming PC's for my wife
and me with Rison seven eighteen hundred
and eighteen hundred X and then a year
later and II made them so much better
without overclocking oh wow cool this is
actually uh so this this letter so first
of all one of those I use for a web
server and the other one I have by my
gaming PC to stream while
playing farm simulator 2017 I have a and
that comes from someone who actually did
it so farm simulator what I want to know
from you sir is how accurate is that
game to what you used to do I'm a third
2600 ex I used to retouch old photos
with Adobe Photoshop
I just turned 67 years old and it keeps
my old brain working and all the parts
are small and clean and mostly only fit
one way wash your channel every day have
a good one
J and that is very much appreciated
awesome awesome history on that very
cool that you went from sheep herding of
all things and seventh from 74 to 99 to
technology and definitely very
respectable to retrain and computer and
not a good time to and 99 just before
y2k when everything was destroyed as we
know it
what I think so we got 2 left I think we
have two left drop this over here so
these are some pretty cool where were
those uh oh there they are the and the
drones are definitely very cool pieces
from that box are those four black spots
on the older andcb is the way of
supporting the cooler on top if not what
did they use as a spacer back before the
IHS I'm not actually sure yes what
precisely
if these I mean someone can please
comments because I was not I was not
building systems with these so please
can't let everyone know I'm assuming
they are just for spacing but I don't
know if they had a different purpose
anyway yes those four pads are used to
protect the chip thank you thank you for
clarifying that ok so let's do the last
two one of them still has a bunch of
small surface mount devices on it and J
thank you again for that that a message
information and the CP is very cool
story this one is from California if I
could open it that would be great but
I'm afraid of cutting through it at this
point
okay okay there we go
California and it's got a note let's see
what see what's in here
so for those you can missed it I did ask
people to include notes of what the the
product did back when they were using it
so we could frame it or do whatever
we're doing
there's cardboard on my shirt with with
the appropriate of historical
information Intel product let's let's
pull out the rest of it there you go
that's a that's a CPU it's a slot based
CPU
it's got glue on it holding some stuff
together I don't know if that was
aftermarket or not there's a slot base
CPU I'm sure there's a note in here that
shouldn't say what it is but feel free
to jump in if you already know don't
blame the shake on the camera by the way
that's me not holding stuff steady and
this one from from one princess pso-1
who sent this said subject overclocking
the cell around 300 a CPU this was my
first computer build and the best
overclocking CPU of the age according to
Tom's Hardware at time of 1998 links to
Tom's Hardware haha how the mighty have
fallen this CPU did some nice air cooled
overclocking up to 450 megahertz to 544
ish very nice great at overclock on that
back then it was used for Diablo
Starcraft and then EverQuest Diablo
definitely deserving I don't even
remember what I played Diablo on
Starcraft I think I played it on an e
machine and EverQuest I think I played
on a North Gate computer and then after
that I upgraded to an end for system and
the rest is gaming history nowadays
ironic Saudis have a hard K it's very
smooth or Star Trek Online number one
our Diablo 3 the future I will upgrade
to a production set to make architecture
and animation videos and they are
salivating at the thought of quick rate
racing animations being made with Unreal
Engine
and obd I have some drafts on my channel
if you want to see what I will be up to
in the future so you want to put the
Seaview on your wall with others I think
we'll be in good company I agree with
you definitely and and very cool
information on that one I mean Diablo
Starcraft and EverQuest are about what I
was playing around at same time so it's
there in good company battery batteries
getting charged last box I think that we
have today if you sent more like I said
no guarantee stuff will be on camera but
we just picked up whatever was already
there and I'm just gonna have to brush a
bunch of these SMDs onto the floor and
vacuum that more something that vacuum
we need the Dyson vacuum for about 30
capacitors and service mount devices on
the table so this is the last one give
me a second to I took this Hey
okay don't eat it anonymous this one is
from anonymous the Anonymous hacker
4chan sent this and what is it
top okay we'll open at the one labeled
top not to be shown live okay I will set
this aside does that mean the products
are the are the note do you know which
just the letter okay so okay note is
well noted I will read that later since
this said not to be Sean live I think
I'm being told it's probably just the
letter that can't be shown live zip-ties
always it good start what what is it is
it it's the last one last box guys
Jennifer Roger two dollars for post
unboxing hand sanitizer
damn it what is it it's a it's a small
board okay what what else is in there
nude Mattel display adapter or doll
adapter DisplayPort to DVI no that was
just what was originally in there now
what's in there now they're just like
stuff falling out everywhere okay so
we've got a bunch of cooler parts that
much is known we have some cooler parts
now I need to open the actual things
that they probably go through that is a
cool looking board emwave IBM 3827 80
pro uh when is this from when is when is
this from just buy it
read the letter for assembly
interactions oh fat guy 1 1 2 1 that is
the alias that was written on this
letter read the letter for assembly
directions thank you I will do that I
will keep all these together so that we
don't mix it up so that made in Canada -
make this alright so we'll set these
aside because these all go together and
I I'm not positive what it is just yet
it is an IBM part so that's cool where's
that letter there it is so let's set
these we have a lot of space here I'm
coming to realize
set these aside there's thunder in the
background
couple more parts this looks cool okay I
still send for is in I mean yeah the the
box is open there's no guarantee we'll
show stuff this is kind of a special
thing we might do it again I don't know
people seem to like it so if you like
this definitely let us know so I can
take note and do it again if it's
deserving Ryan will keep an eye on the
chat if you have comments we have a lot
to clean up later this looks pretty damn
cool so IBM 686 P 166 plus 133 megahertz
check this thing out man this is cool we
have all the parts and I've been told
that the letter has instructions on
assembly so that's pretty damn cool this
is pretty sweet yeah chat agrees hell
yeah that's awesome oh yes I like this
people are saying yeah dude see if you
can get it running that I'm wave it is a
sound and telephony DSP here from the
1980s cool rebranded cyrix is that a
riser expansion slot everyone loves this
how long has the stream been going to be
an hour it was not that what do you say
to our 50 socketable parts sockets seven
for the socket the product is still
socket I'm not going to remove it until
I read because I don't know if there's
something special like I don't know if
there's a reason not to D socket
anything and the like guy who sent this
isn't chat fat guy 1 1 2 1 that is the
person who sent it let me try and catch
up to this the daughter board is in the
box still ok so the daughter board still
in the box let's let's try let's pull
some of the other stuff I have so much
stuff here
just CPU is everywhere and trait Lee
appreciated okay so what else what else
is in here the daughter board I think if
I understood correctly and it came with
zip ties I'm guessing those are going to
be needed for assembly I'm trying to
keep an eye on chat if I'm missing a lot
of stuff back when tech was built -
laughter this is I'm awesome harbor
right here I completely agree with you
there you go it's at Foxconn it is Fox
gone so I suppose this is the this is
the mini Tower slot board mini Tower
slot board check that out
aspire so I think that's the daughter
board it's got PCI and it looks like
maybe is ace laws I think PCI and I'm
pretty sure these are is a are they not
correct me if I'm wrong chat I studied
that at one point yes is a.m. PCI and
being told riser board thank you very
much
so that's pretty damn cool I say slots
for sure I mean told by a chat okay so
that that assembles I'm assuming this
might have to do with it I could check
the instructions anything else that all
the parts think that's all the parts
I'll set it down think that's all the
parts so we have those and then we have
this thing
and how difficult is this to assemble
can I do this live
speaking of do it live code do it live
discount code for the gamers Nexus
storage store doc gamers Nexus net
goddamn - should I should give me some
credit for that one that was a flawless
that was a flawless integration starting
Garen taxes on that we have a code 10%
off of everything during the stream only
right so I've got the note here not to
be shown live so I'm not going to do
that but I think it's got yes ink okay
so I will read the part of this I think
is ok to read live so there is a I'll
paraphrase for paraphrase it there's a
motherboard and a daughter board a set
of operational it says operational
vintage computer hardware from 95 and it
was scrapped from a working quote
unquote working Acer desktop the exact
model can't recall okay let me skip
through some of this the daughter board
slots on to the rise onto the riser
around mid board while these small
expansion pin header pins are located
above the CPU and RAM slots I included
the full set looks rather interesting I
completely agree okay so I'm liking this
I see there is in fact some instruction
on assembly and I'm confident we can do
it
I am going to assemble this off stream
because I we've been streaming for a
while I don't want to miss something and
mess it up but it does look pretty
straightforward but still I'll do that
off stream I don't know we might we
might just like stick it in its own
shadow box or something that's not quite
the size we need something bigger than
that because it's got that riser it
would just mount it somewhere but that
would be cool just on its own so thank
you for sending that over very much
appreciated we will absolutely be
figuring out what to do with it we're
hosting some guests from the hardware
industry this week so don't count on me
doing this immediately but we'll be
getting this done hopefully pretty soon
I don't I don't know what we're gonna do
with the art yet we have some had some
very good ideas
chat some stuff I want to set aside as
like history pieces solve it I want as I
don't know I like the pixel art GM logo
idea out of CPU so that's pretty cool
and it gives us something to do with the
duplicates too
okay does the new autonomous death deck
wobble at all like your old up-and-down
desk you never test it in the build
video can you it's got a bunch of stuff
on it right now
I don't think so does not really and
like I can make it wobble if I really
want to but it's it's pretty stable got
a point the light hang on so like I can
always you can I can make that table
wobble and that's eight feet wide and
three hundred and something pounds but
it's pretty down it's much more stable
than the old table so if that
disappoints you I'm really sorry but but
we've had people donating to the non
wobbling table fund for quite a while
now we finally finally did it
press W for the wobble okay quick
rundown of what you got I only joined
the stream ten or fifteen minutes ago
that's completely fair once handers done
adjusting the lights perhaps we can zoom
out and just show the table because
there is there's a lot of stuff I'll do
my best to recap it for you there's a
why is everyone pushing W for wobbly
you're not supposed to want wobble all
right so we have some cool like these
were cool
Sun micro part so these are ultrasparc
three eyes we have an ultra spark to
that actually looks really interesting
as well is because it's different I like
how it looks so that was a pretty cool
part we got on this stack of CPUs a
bunch of pentium parts we got the old
IBM part that I just showed that's
really cool looking forward to
assembling that we have an ATI X 300s II
lots of 99 era CPUs lots of core 2 duos
and in that era of CPU we got a lot of
really cool stuff a gambit poster
and a really cool story by the way from
a viewer who just turned 67 years old
and is still building pcs and seems very
happy with the rise and upgrades
recently and I think most people would
agree with you
so that's like--that's quick recap
stream will be archived that's really
want it anyway we have some super chats
and stuff to you but a couple of couple
of notes for you
so we're planning to do a live stream if
you like this will have a live scene
that should be pretty interesting if it
goes as planned if the storm doesn't
kill us so the plan is I'd like to do a
couple of bill to our production PC is
with Patrick and we'll both be on camera
I'm hoping to take two cameras I'm not
sure if we can but YouTube has a
multicam function for live streams that
should be pretty cool and the plan is to
work on production systems why is
everyone saying 9:00 was just 9 in
reference to ship show show the platter
again oh yes one wants to see the the
silicon wafer so like that is certainly
worth sharing again oh nine lives that's
why they're saying it the nine lives cat
food yes
oh my Mike what's wrong with it okay
sorry about that so so what can wait for
that got damaged we ordered this and it
arrived sort of shattered but it looks
pretty good now Patrick did a good job
so just an explosion layout I was told
it's an AMD wafer
number 73 apparently but I don't know I
have no way of validating that I could
maybe send close-ups of it to some CPU
analysts and they might know what it is
where did this wafer come from it came
from a magical land known as eBay so
yeah that was pretty cool too that's
already friends oh and old Andy posters
I'll show one of them will show let's
show this one Patrick Patrick did not
push that on very tight I will push that
on tighter later haha
performance for the cutting edge I need
a PC processor that lets me rule and
bold my digital world
AMD me the AMD Athlon XP processor so
that came in as well we had two of those
posters and don't worry we're gonna try
and get some some Nvidia and Intel
posters in as well so everyone can just
just cool it
Oh inevitable shill comments I'll fix
that later so yeah pretty cool stuff
thank you for sending it along much
appreciated
let me do my best on the Super chats
there were a lot of store purchases as
well that you were picking that stuff up
as soon as the stream and I will be
discontinuing the livestream discount
code until the next live stream which
will hopefully be our production PC
build with multicam that'll be really
fun
alright did you use real-time ray
tracing for the GM loader we answer that
one we got Spencer who suggested P CPUs
for a pixel art very good idea on that
and then we had Val Chris one dollar no
message
Scott $1.99 the stream is making me miss
healthier coolers we can maybe do
something with that at some point try
I'm Carl four dollars why only two
threads per core on most CPUs that is a
much deeper question than was expected
for this live stream two threads per
core from other CP is so I give you the
quick version look up SMT it's
simultaneous multi-threading and look up
hyper threading it's Intel's branded
version the wikipedia page does a pretty
good job of giving you a top level and
then you can look up CCX architecture
for AMD Rison parts that will show you
how the cores are segmented into
different dies and and should help you
understand why they're done that way
partly for size reasons but I will leave
that one there for this us two dollars
use this money for lighting for studio
for better ray tracing okay we will will
do that because the real world is not
rageface enough Serban xsf $10
my package might be in tomorrow EJ
motherwort oh we got that one we opened
that one and it is it is all here and
safe mm Val Chris no message thank you
about us Ben Ward $5 please make a GN
logo mouse mat with just for a trace it
around the logo a pre-order one for sure
yes yes that is that is what you should
pre-order ha of all the Vince to
pre-order it's still gotta have ray
tracing in it apparently not a real
potato five dollars I will send some
stuff soon what's the cutoff date don't
worry it's not potatoes P o ta TOS this
time there's no real cutoff date we have
the P o box open
so you sends up whenever please please
don't send anything that you feel
sentimentally attached to that you feel
has real value that you could do
something with we're fine like we could
make use of stuff in wall art and stuff
like that but I don't want people
sending stuff that they really have a
personal attachment to you because you
should keep that yes Jennifer order two
dollars for post unboxing hand sanitizer
Sean five dollars what cpu is that which
one are you referring to
sorry it's not sexy
Dennis $1.99 and any change you got with
the an each any chance you got the
wrench screwdriver
yes yes we did it was earlier in the
stream and I very much appreciate that
it is going to be able to do some
90-degree angles that we were an
equipped for earlier so I and I think
that's why why you send it so thank you
for sending it we got the note read that
on stream as well
fat guy one one-to-one technology Steve
assembled the Acer board you only have
to slot through your so card it's not
difficult just need to clear the space
getting getting commands I don't know
what what goes where what do we even
have for this I don't know where this
goes either so I would rather not on
stream I think this came with it too and
the fan
maybe for the processor that looks like
the processor yes that is for the
processor not positive where that goes
this looks like it goes probably on this
thing but not sure which orientation
perhaps the other way yes that goes on
that there you go okay so it's in fact
pretty straightforward and is this is a
this looks like is a no not not going
there I don't know we're off to look
more carefully after the stream where
that goes but anyway that's really
cooler goes I think I'm sure the
daughterboard goes and then we've got
this other card which is the emwave card
that I think someone from chat says it's
from the 80s I don't know if that's true
or not because I think the rest of this
is from the 95 but anyway that's that
would sock it there okay does it go the
other way
no so anyway that's that's the parts I'm
gonna leave that there for now but thank
you for sending it along so alright we
got three super chats not gonna read any
more the sound of a vintage slot yeah it
does have a very specific very very
specific sound okay so got one more
Super chat right after I said I wouldn't
read any $5 from Andrew Cruz can you do
a deep dive with an expert on why tons
of cores are better at ray-tracing yes
but I don't know when but yes maybe
David Cantor someone like that so see
we're going to put some mugs on
pre-order in the shop without real
benchmarking they were there for actual
order but they don't have benchmarking
you are correct
so thank you everyone for watching a lot
of fun on this one and really cool
hardware came in we're gonna figure out
what to do with it in terms of our I
have some ideas for just old like sort
of a display of the oldest stuff in the
order of sort of the seminal product and
then we have ideas for for doing things
with the duplicates as well like the
pixel art idea and this thing will get
its own own
or something like that or display at
some point so thanks for watching as
always subscribe for more we'll have
another live stream soon we will have a
lot of benchmarking coming up I know
some of you have wanted more
benchmarking while we had the liquid
metal stuff we have the corrosion
testing so hopefully that got you some
interesting stuff that we've not been
able produce for a little while while
moving and we have lots of GPU stuff
coming up obviously and then we have
companies visiting this week for
interviews and discussions we have a
mini ITX case review coming up we have
two ATX case reviews coming up so
there's a lot of content on the pipe
we're just kind of it's a weird like
like rubber band effects with moving
where everything slows down to get it
over and then everything's moved in and
then we have to start working on actual
content from the new space and that
takes time too so thanks for waiting
around though it's coming up soon and
that's it for this one so subscribe for
more restored our cameras axis dotnet if
you want to use that code before I
disable it in a couple of minutes here
the code is do it live and that'll be
just continued at the end of the stream
until the next one I'll see you all next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
