Donna and today we were talking about
mechanical keyboards that we've posted a
few articles and videos about mechanical
keyboards lately and this video looks at
basically all of the best gaming
solutions for our mechanical keyboards
out there right now ranging from $50 to
$200 in price and there are a lot of
keyboards the mechanical keywords have
exploded on the scene lately it's no
doubt that they are the hit item just
like closed-loop liquid coolers were the
hit item a couple of years ago and that
means that there's a lot of competition
which means the prices are finally
falling a bit on mechanical keyboards
some of the original mechanical
keyboards include IBM's buckling spring
model M but things have changed a bit
since then we're relying on Cherry MX
Cale toper Alpes and a couple other
switch types these days so let's get to
it first of all this guide will cover
from $50 up to $200 we're gonna start at
the top at the most expensive and work
our way down logitech's g9 1000 ryan
spark keyboard recently received our
editors choice award and uses the new
Romer G switch type which is somewhat
similar to damped Cherry MX brown
switches in feel but pretty different in
terms of the actual engineering and that
means the way it's built there's
actually very little backlight bleed
which is important because this is an
RGB keyboard so that's pretty cool and
it means that the colors are more
vibrant and really only show through the
key cap H letters themselves it doesn't
really bleed over too much and that is
definitely something that's important
for RGB boards we like the overall feel
of it 180 bucks are pretty steep we need
to work our way down a bit
we recommend the Razer BlackWidow chroma
and Corsair k70 or K 95 as alternatives
to the Logitech board if you're unhappy
with the Logitech one for some reason
the K 70 and K 95 are a bit more clean
looking they don't have that gamer
aesthetic that the G 910 does but they
are still RGB boards moving up to the
155 dollar high-end keyboards we have
the toe per type Heaven which is a uses
8 over switch that's what you see on the
screen right here and that's a
combination of rubber domes and Springs
to create a tactile switch that's
somewhat quiet the rubber dome helps
ensure more silence so it's not as
clicky and loud as
Amyx blues or as really any other type
of mechanical switch as buckling Springs
that that model M uses but it still got
that tactile feel the topper type heaven
is expensive because the switches are in
fairly high demand and they're not
really produced on mass in the way that
cherry or kale are but it is still one
hundred fifty five bucks so not terrible
and a good choice for users who want a
more discreet keyboard that doesn't
scream gamer but still has a somewhat
quiet and tactile feel moving down to
$150 - keyboards das professional board
is available for yet another discrete
reasonable office keyboard that can also
be used for gaming this is a mechanical
board that uses Cherry MX Reds but it
also ships with MX blue variants and MX
Brown variants for $135 - twenty dollars
cheaper has n key rollover media Keys
two USB ports onboard and a couple of
other features relatively high build
quality and definitely worth considering
for those who want a more minimalistic
approach and who don't have the budget
for something like the RGB boards we
just looked at moving down next to one
hundred and ten dollars we get mid-range
keyboards there are a lot of keyboards
in this price range including some
Corsair k70 non RGB variants that I am a
big big fan of but the one we recommend
on the guide is Logitech G 7,000 plus at
this price point keyboards begin to
include the premium features like macro
programming and software and LEDs but
aren't necessarily as decked out or as
expensive as the one $50 plus board so
it gives a nice mid-range option I like
the Logitech g7 10 plus it uses damped
MX brown switches they're not quite as
loud and as punchy as some of the other
switch types because of the way MX
browns are natively plus the o-ring
rubber damper so you may not like it if
you don't like it I would suggest
looking at the Corsair k70 which is $130
and well worth the look moving down now
to the budget class mechanical keyboards
we have the $70 Tesoro g2n and thermal
take esports Poseidon's ii keyboards we
have reviewed both of these on the
website I reviewed the Poseidon's II and
liked it it uses KL blue switches they
are clones in effect of the MX blue
switches and it's pretty hard to tell
the difference the Poseidon Z has a 5
year warranty so that
does make it a bit less questionable to
take the Chinese made kale switches and
I like the feel I like the look of the
board works pretty well I never had any
issues with it and that is $70 would
recommend that pretty highly the Tesoro
g2n is one that Michael Kern's reviewed
for the site and that's another $70
board it comes with a pretty cool
detachable numpad if you want the tkl
set up you can take that numpad off and
it becomes ten keyless or you can add it
for a ten key and quality is good it is
using MX brown switches but there are I
believe there are alternatives and you
can pick both of those up with n key
rollover finally the ultra budget range
C is the $50 Rosewell arcade 6000
keyboard which uses Alps clone switches
manufactured by Howe and they are rated
for only 20 million actuations so at 20
million actuations it's about 20 to 30
million less than kale and it's a full
50 to 60 million fewer actuations than
what the Romer G switch is rated for so
not quite as durable but still really
fine for most users to use for a couple
of years and get your $50 worth out of
it so that is what we recommend at that
price range if you're on a budget
poseidon z the TT esports keyboard is
also available and a 10 keyless option
for the same $50 price point so do
consider that if you don't need a 10 key
and that's it for our mechanical
keyboards roundup check the link in the

will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
