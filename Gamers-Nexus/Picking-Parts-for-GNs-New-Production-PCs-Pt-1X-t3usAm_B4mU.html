we are a media production company about
computer hardware and we have no
computers to work on in the new office
we have one we have the old rendering
machine it's well it's got some actually
pretty severe GPU sag issues right now
from that a or s10 atti it's almost
literally falling apart at this point so
that's kind of that's the only machine
we have in here other than laptops so
it's time to go shopping
take out some parts we have cases
already in mind spoiler alert have
plenty of cases so two dark bass pro
nine hundreds kind of likes them they're
big and I'd rather have them under
tables for work systems then on a shelf
so we use two of those we have an NZXT
noctus 450 from ibuypower years ago that
has a special gamers Nexus nameplate on
it so you got to use that and then a
Silverstone PMO one just a case we've
always liked for a lot of reasons so
what we need to do now is take a quick
trip and go shopping for other parts the
hell is that before that this video is
brought to you by Lee Ann Lee is Oh 11
dynamic a case largely designed by
overclocked or dare bower for
high-performance water cooling though
our performance testing also Illustrated
strong air cooling performance the 11
dynamic is affordable high build quality
and offers a unique form factor case
with dual PSU support by one now at the
link in the description below alright
so shopping time by take a trip I meant
15 feet away to the GN inventory area so
some of this stuff is still being filled
in quick note servers in here might be a
bit loud sometimes but we have a couple
parts we already know we want so in 8086
k i bought because after working with
the other one I wanted something I could
overclock pretty easily and high and I
know this has been so we'll get one of
those throw that into the main rendering
an editing machine that that will be
using daily so that'll be in 8086 K and
that's because we found that premiere
he likes frequency often more so than
just straight cores that has a bit of
both but it has more frequency so we're
gonna favor the Intel higher frequency
part for Adobe from your purposes next
thing we already Requested I found a
flaw in our shelf design keygen okay
sorry gigabyte okay well can't use that
one we've requested a few parts from
gigabyte I think I don't know if we got
this for review or for it's for review
or if we got it for the system I'm
building but we can do a bit of both
because we're setting out the power
supply review stuff and incidentally it
allows me to remove the board so this is
AZ 370 or gaming board that we
specifically requested from gigabyte
some that are made apartment I think
which is fine
it still suits us so this is gonna be
the main system so that's what we're
looking at for the board and then we're
gonna throw this in there so we've got
an 80 86 K decent board for overclocking
I'd really like to cut some fins in that
but that's okay for now so that's at
surf platform now we need power supply I
don't know if I'm going to use like this
one we might just keep out for review
purposes because one of their first
power supplies if not their first power
supply so might just review that and
pull like a Corsair unit that we're not
using for reviews or anything I think we
have some 650 s or eight fifties coming
in from coarser that we can use so not
sure on this right now
may want to hold onto it for review
instead and this is other stuff for
review we're not gonna use any of it the
production machines next part I know
that for one of the other so we need to
build five machines for ish one of them
the main production machine is going to
be a 286 K and some other parts next
machine will either be mine or Patrick's
Patrick needs pretty good core account
pretty good frequency more of a balance
between them then premier wants and
that's for his software that he wrote
that his frame rate analysis console
analysis of teryan and frame rate
performance in console games stuff like
that so software hero we haven't super
optimized it for anything so I'm
thinking for him one of the two acts 99
boards and not actually I honestly it's
been so long I don't even know the
difference so let's look at these two
boards the EVGA x99 boards are in test
benches so we need to look at these
separately so that's board number one
what even is this board this is an X 99
a 2 that's convenient this is X 99
deluxe if I were in a store picking
between these this I think this is the
one that one of our patreon backers
traded me when I met him met up locally
we got pizza and he tried to meet the
board so shout out to disturbed medic if
you're if you're watching but we've got
a choice between this one and the other
what's the main difference here PCIe
slots don't care
vrm I can't tell from here what the
differences are but they look very
similar ok so looks like we review a lot
of parts I don't actually memorize when
they all come out the a2 is a more
recent release it's one of the last x 99
boards that came out a 2 is a 2016
release the deluxe is I think a twenty
thirteen or fourteen release and a 2's
got some more USB 3.1 support then the
deluxe does from what I was just reading
on tech report which looks to be
accurate as you can see right there
there's there's your evidence of that so
we may go with this just for the modern
IO compatibility but still kind of a
toss-up could could go with either one
there so that's can go with both to
depend on the CPUs we have available so
speaking of let's see what CPUs we have
available because if we have enough
spare x99 parts I'm never going to use
other than testing which we should have
duplicates for that then we could go
with two x99 systems
so we have here's our h EDT parts i
guess i'll show you the all the
walkthrough here h EDT so we have a
concern here in that anything that is
going to get used regularly for
benchmarks for overclock in live streams
anything like that it cannot go in a
production machine it's like we have 179
ATX e that is not going on production
machines it needs to stay out for
benchmarking the point of it is to make
content and we can't have it tied up
these are all desktop parts we have more
desktop parts starting to fill up this
one we've got a lot of AMD risin over
here and the a series and FX series so
there's an FX cpu that's currently
checked out in my name for my production
system off site and we've got rise and
rise in more rising we have threader for
somewhere i don't know if we we don't
have a special trait for that so let's
look at the h EDT stuff first 8086 k for
the main production system we have sixty
eight hundred sixty nine hundred k
probably not retesting those and if we
are not anytime soon
77 for TX the discontinued one that
lives a very short life so we could put
that on a machine kind of not a great
cpu 4960 x probably not getting retested
that's x79 i don't have any spare boards
what is this
7800 or seventy twenty actually seventy
nine hundred x with a missing capacitor
we probably want to leave the 7900 out
for testing and these would be x 299
anyway so that's that poses a challenge
let's do this
let's pull at least one of these for the
x99 platform let me check the specs on
there's been a while all right eight
cores 16 threads whereas a 6 cores 12
threads frequency is comparable so we're
gonna go with 8 cores 16 threads
probably not retest the 6900 k if
someone wants comparative data between
this and the modern 7000 series HTTP
cpus we already have it up there we
won't rerun it anytime soon if we do
we'll have to pull it but more likely
will rerun this one if we keep that one
out so let's pull this cpu out so that
covers us for two systems let me put the
over on the shopping cart I think this
is where that goes
okay we just restocked these by the way
the gamer is a Nexus Cobalts beer glass
with a gold rim if you'd like one there
in the store not all of them come
actually none of them come with a 60
900k so we've got 69 hundred k x9 board
this one probably and 8086 k gigabyte
board so we're covered there for some of
them so we've got two platforms we need
a video card okay
also from the gigabyte RMA Department
Thank You gigabyte
we've got a 1080 di that we can throw in
so this has been tested and abused at
their department we've but we've done we
actually I should go back and wow new
generations or whatever this is a 1080i
water-cooled card we did the 1080
version of this card that a reader
loaned us actually a while ago and it
did okay it the block is interesting you
can kind of see it through there so that
copper comes down and touches the vram
and I don't know if this specific yes it
does so this model also has a copper
heat pipe in there that contacts the vrm
and kind of hard to see from here but
there is actually contact so it's cold
plate to copper block that goes to the
vrm and vram so vrm over here via heat
pipe so basically one cooling solution
is shared by everything on the card
which means the GPU temperature will
appear higher and it is but that's
because it's sharing the solution with
the other components on the board and
all of them are going to be cooler so
that'll be our main card probably for
the probably for the primary production
system get that sagging gigabyte card
out of there that really likes the
extreme extreme card was never really
one of our top choices even back when we
reviewed it the one that's in there now
so it'll be great to replace it with
this thing and that'll take care of the
main production system so that's
separate these a bit that'll go on this
side this can go on this side as well
and things on the way where should I put
it that's going over there I guess right
yeah okay also I should say people are
gonna be like Steve's you're
disrespecting Intel by throwing the
processor that they gave you I bought it
and I'm not disrespecting Intel I'm
commenting on the commentaries Ram is
next
so we've got everything else Rams on the
other side of the shelf so now we're in
the RAM area is it really doesn't need
to be there okay it's not Ram area and
we have ddr3 ddr4 to choose from just
upgraded to these trays they've hit 50
except each one uses like two slots so
Patrick's done all of this organization
I think I would love to have one of our
four to five production systems still on
ddr3 we might stick with an X 79
platform for that so the one that's
currently a main production machine
might turn into mine or Patrick's if the
6900 K system whichever one of us that
doesn't accommodate we'll probably get
the Xeon machine or change it to a 49 60
X or whatever that K what if that
processor was called because that's ddr3
so that would allow us to tap into some
of our ddr3 memory which is becoming
increasingly obsolete and not getting
any use at all I mean there's there's
kits in here that were made for Nehalem
because they told him packs of three so
you can use a triple channel on the
Heylin platforms so I this is like it's
still plenty good memory but for the
ddr4 system so we got to pick something
we have a lot of core serve engines
right there
two of these kits are for GPU and CPU
review platforms three actually and we
have one duplicate right now so I'll
pull the duplicate and then we have
another duplicate on the way from
Corsair that will be the same kit
this is it so 32 gigabytes and it is 32
hundred megahertz CL 16 which one of
these kits Bend really well for us but I
don't think it was this one because I
marked that one so I'll pull these four
sticks and that will take care of we'll
use all four for the main production
machine we want 32 gigabytes in there
just I mean because premier uses a whole
lot of memory so that takes care of that
we have another kid of this coming in
from Corsair so that will take care of
the other production machine we're gonna
have two production machines that are
for video editing one that's for what I
do which is bit of everything one for
Patrick and then maybe one extra so the
coarser stuff will take care of the to
editing machines not sure what I'm gonna
use yet but let me go put this down
almost damaged something so we'll I'll
commit right now it's using an X 79 for
one of them so still have a good x79
board it's an old like a C's one that
came with black flag of all things so
that series at the age of it Assassin's
Creed Black Flag that is not the band
but we'll put this in one of the Intel
or rise in desktop platforms
that's dual channel that makes way more
sense it's sixteen gigabytes which is
plenty for some of us but not for those
doing video editing so pull that should
pull a video card for the other editing
machine
okay so keke and what CPU did I use for
the first one eighty eighty six K
alright cool
forty nine sixty X that'll go back in
the system with a Z on it because the Z
on kind of sucks it's got way more cores
but the speed is really bad it's like
three gigahertz and I can't work with
that so we'll gently place that there
and then I need a GPU for the other
editing machine I'm thinking a 1080 Ti
we need some of these for testing so
this is CPU testing this is for like
other component testing that I do can't
go on machines we use daily could use
the ACE use card I kind of want to keep
this one or this is actually colorful we
actually have some parts in the other
room that I would I'd rather use a
hybrid for this we're still making
progress in this room this is gonna be
the testing room I put in the cooler
test bench oh that's actually one that I
made this is a reference 1080i that that
might be an okay fit I kind of want to
keep it free for comparison versus the
whatever Nvidia comes out with
immediately for gaming so I might just
pull here's the thing I think this card
this EVGA 1080 TI I suspect is not
rebuilt properly or is broken so what
we'll do is we'll pull that one and use
that well I'll pull it and pull it apart
and see if I can get it functional if I
can and that'll be our card for the
second production machine because ii
like video editing machine because it's
not getting used anyway because it's
been like broken for a while now so pull
it apart see if i can fix it so that's
that's video card number two so now i
need to pick a card for either my system
or Patricks depending on who ends up
using the one with the 6900 k we saw
earlier I'm thinking I want CUDA we use
CUDA acceleration for a lot of stuff so
we're gonna stick with a CUDA
accelerating card and I'm thinking 1070
TI I have a couple 1070 TI's the one
that we least need for review and
benchmarking purposes is going to be the
colorful 1070 TI it was fine
wasn't particularly exciting but fine so
we'll pull that that'll take care of my
Carter Patrick's again whoever uses this
system the 2.5 inch drives we reserved
for the test benches typically our stuff
is not I Oh bound so these almost never
are a factor as long as it's fast enough
to old games in the OS
and then we have a bunch of em without
two drives we rarely use these sometimes
I get used for test benches like
threader per h EDT systems these i think
they're not particularly good but
they're kingston drives 120 gigabytes of
storage Bizon controllers I'd have to
look at benchmarks and I probably will
but I'm gonna tentatively pulleys for
now will either use them and raid on one
system or just standalone because the
thing is all of our actual storage is
remote as in not in the system being
built so for things like media
production for video files all that it's
not stored locally don't need a lot of
local storage don't need fast local
storage
we just need good enough we have a
Samsung drive here we go so I pull this
aside that's a maybe so that's a maybe
for that system I'll look up the
benchmarks later and figure out if it
stays or goes and then we can buy
another one if we have to and then this
is an 850 I'm gonna leave the 960 pro
alone for benchmarks so this is a
samsung SSD 850 Evo it's MDOT - I think
I bought this one and if not then one of
the CPU vendors sent it to us so next we
need cooler we have a good amount of
coolers I can't pull an air cooler
because I'm just starting some air
cooler benchmarks liquid coolers we do
have duplicates of some stuff but the
thing is there's a whole crate of a
Sutekh coolers of which I have many
duplicates and that we haven't brought
it over yet so I'll bring over the
creative ace tech coolers there
unbranded we're never gonna review them
we've tested some but won't need many
like duplicates of them so we'll pull
that over and use that for all the
systems it's a boring solution I'm sorry
but the thing is we don't like despite
having a lot of hardware we don't
actually get to just use whatever we
Keegan's helping my point here thank you
very much we don't get to use whatever
we want for whatever system we want so
to make a point my system at home has an
FX 83-70 that's under volted and under
clocks cuz the motherboards garbage
clearly i have my pick of processors but
the thing is this business runs on
making cool content benchmarking
components
and it's I mean it's what I want to do
with the components and also it's what
generates the money to keep the business
going so we leave the good stuff out for
testing and do not engage it in a system
because once it goes in the system to
pull it out requires downtime and that
starts really adding up in terms of
things that we don't want to do like
take a production system offline pull
the parts and test it for days so we
just leave it out of the systems so we
don't get to pull whatever we want which
means that it is easier for me to just
do the boring solution I'm pulling a
bunch of unbranded Azek coolers for
cooling for power supplies same thing
we're gonna be testing some of these
power supplies pretty soon with our
power supply testing setup so I can't
just pull whatever off the shelf because
once it's in the system I don't know if
we've invalidated that power supply by
abusing it it may not be representative
anymore I don't know if we have to pull
it out of a system that shuts us down
for a while so power supplies I'm gonna
weigh down a little bit see what we test
what gets through testing first we can
pull it and use it otherwise I think
Corsair might be sending some stuff out
so well wait on the power supplies
cooler is gonna be the ACE tech coolers
we have a storage solution we have video
cards and then we need to build a couple
more production machines still but
that'll pull those parts later so at
this point all you need to know is that
we're gonna be doing a livestream
building of stuff I'm me working with
Patrick who does the case testing these
days we'll build systems during the
livestream both of us working on them
simultaneously we're hoping to do
multicam hoping to do multi people on
the stream so it should be a lot of fun
should be pretty different and a lot of
fun I think just for everyone to watch
and for us to do don't have a date on it
yet but check Twitter comm slash gamers
Nexus for updates and hardware news and
ask Ian episodes we'll probably update
there once we're ready with a date on
the live stream this video is more or
less a note for the fact that we will be
doing a live stream so yeah it's a
little bit later on content than some of
our other stuff but we're still setting
up the office this is a big part of
setting up the office and we wanted to
let you all know that we're getting
pretty close now to having something
functional we just you know a couple
more so everything's doing a live stream
that should cover it so stored on
cameras XS dotnet to pick up one of the
bureau glasses that was shown
this video we just restocked a lot of
them I know they sold out within 16 or
so hours last time so have you missed it
their back story on cameras axis dotnet
it's got the gold rim on it and then a
cobalt blue glass with our tear down
logo printed on it looks awesome you go
