Don that we're at PAX East 2015 this is
day two packs just got back from GDC now
we're here i am at the castle story
booth which is a game develop my sorrow
upon studios and i'm joined by a Terry
who who's been on the project for a
while
and to us to talk to us about some of
that
timelines and the game's current status
so for those who aren't familiar with
Castle story and give us a very brief
elevator pitch of the game well acostas
re still makes between an RTS and like a
puzzle game with Lego so the goal is to
protect the virtual go for a moment it's
brother clear crystal against waves on
an amendment survivable but there's also
a sandbox mode where you can just create
also
that's the main goal dick right
and the project was kick-started do you
recall the value of the Kickstarter how
much money brought it
gained like this
715
dollars from the Kickstarter to that
there
the past year
how to get married exes
when one was
the King stars first launched in about
twenty twelve all right
so the prototype came out first there
was a prototype for early backers then
there was sort of an early alpha and
where's the game currently okay like I
said it's a grungy Andrew really access
we're still like trying to develop it
our goal is to reach
in my the kind of person we are in mind
with me
Dante kickstarter for generator 2016
is that you were
feature we're renting it
like more enemies or
morin mission or
have there been any major hurdles and
development any major obstacles that
have kept up progress
first when we did the prototype dancing
wasn't the solid enough so we did a lot
of systemic robots
that what we have been doing the past
year and
this year men finally reached a level
where
a new feature that was the big
and it's on unity
it's still on unity for
maybe eventually what's the current
development team size and how has it
grown over the past three years okay so
when the project started with
there were only treated livers
there are six almost seven because we're
trying to hire more people
management everything like
do you have a how do you respond to
community criticism over the timeline
over the past five years there's if you
look around on forums there's some
criticism that development has been slow
do you have a response to that well
obviously games beta times and since
we're
we never made any game before we
we mostly data
beginners errors but no
we drank catch that up
like I said the 2016 finish to the
diversion
like I said the person we wanted for
kickstarter is in the
because we still want to develop the
game
feature every night after that
and any closing thoughts or items here
for the fans and backers
continue to support us I mean we read
almost all emails since the beginning
and we really clearly
like the feedbacks in that will help us
improve the game
so you heard it here leave keep sending
feedback the emails and very rare for
developers to check all those emails so
the game it looks like it is targeted
for a quarter one or January 2016
