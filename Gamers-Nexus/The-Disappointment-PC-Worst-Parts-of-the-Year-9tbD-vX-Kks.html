okay
this video is brought to you by thermal
grizzly whose throne pace we used to
paint the words build me on the side of
the age 500 PE and whose owner said that
it was the best use case of the throne
pace that he's ever seen you can find
more about thermal grizzly and the cryo
not paste which we used at the link in
the description below the compound we
used has a high thermal conductivity for
a paste is non conductive and can be
used as a substitute for a still
high-performing compound if you don't
want to go full liquid metal learn more
at the link in the description below
this is our disappointment build it
costs twelve hundred and eighty dollars
wait no no you still need the power
supply motherboard RAM storage fire
extinguisher sprinkler system OSHA
inspectors electricians for 30 amp
outlets and breakers carbon monoxide
detectors and hearing protection but you
do save on your home heating system in
the winter so why are they here today
why have they returned well sort of
being possessed briefly and being forced
to wear this shirt I also thought that
it would be kind of fun to put Vega
Frontier Edition a 77 40 X and the H 500
P all-in-one build and see if we can
burn the place down before end of year
so the 77 40 X required some dusting off
after its tragic fall in the review it
didn't collect a bit of dust make your
frontier Edition needed a little bit of
work as well and the H 500 P we restored
to its original configuration without
the mesh mod because Coolermaster never
really liked when we said that we fixed
it specifically that word with the mesh
mod so we thought we would restore it
back to the intended use with acrylic
and this then is the disappointment
build just as a quick side note no
collateral damage is meant for the
components that have nothing to do with
the disappointment aspect for example
the random power supply motherboard and
RAM that we pulled but the three core
components are definitely on the
disappointing side so we thought we'd
kind of go back through almost like a
flashback up
and look at some of the reasons why
those were disappointed when they came
out and hopefully we can avoid those
types of products for 2018 and that's
unlikely but we can at least set a
baseline for what to expect next year
that way we aren't too disappointed with
the launches coming out here after so
what we're gonna do is go through each
of the three core disappointing
components one at a time remind
ourselves and everyone else why they
were disappointing and then we'll look
at some quick numbers that were run on
this system as a whole because it did in
fact complete its test without melting
completely asterisk but we'll start with
Vega Frontier Edition because it's been
out of the light for the longest amount
of time it feels like forever since we
bought this card and spent basically a
month testing it just like we did with
the Titan V so Vega frontier Edition if
you missed it
like we did it's been rebranded actually
it originally shipped something like a
thousand or twelve hundred dollars
somewhere in that range and now it's
about eight hundred bucks
regularly it's not a sale that's just
the new price and it is also the
blockchain pioneers card so this card
Vega Frontier Edition which spent the
beginning of its life being touted as a
creators card a Productivity card a it's
not for gaming card even though it's not
all that different from Vega 64 which
arguably is for gaming it spent the
beginning of its life focusing on those
productivity endeavors and creativity
and all these rendering and 3d animation
and all that software
well now it's been rebranded to the
blockchain pioneers card to the point
that the site actually lists quote
unleashing the power of Vega to crunch
blockchain algorithms that striking hash
rates perhaps Andy got duped by the same
rumor we were duped by when we thought
it would have 70 mega hash per second
rates that in fact turned out to be
untrue and one would assume that AMD
might know better by now that that was
untrue but it's got striking hash rates
so we can start there at least and
blockchain pioneer ian is now listed so
high up on the strengths of the card on
its own marketing page
that it's above production the thing
that the card was released for and the
thing that everyone touted the most when
it came out I now fully understand why
AMD didn't allow media to take photos
during the press event the briefing
where the card was unveiled along with
its rx Vega brethren it's because they
spent an hour or more actually let's
just be fair and call it eight because
it was an entire day telling us that the
card was specifically being kept out of
the hands of minors this is something
that Andy told all media it's going to
gamers we're going to get this into the
hands of gamers by bundling it with game
packs you spend $100 more and you get
two free games in exchange for that and
also a coupon code that's
non-transferable and you have to use
that checkout but anyway the point is
they were keeping it in the hands of
gamers so we're gonna keep this away
from minors and then sort of like some
sort of addiction they pretend that
gamers are the core focus and then light
up at night literally because it's a
really hot card and that's where we are
today blockchain pioneering there's
nothing inherently wrong with that
it's just the mixture of not even
marketing just language to media versus
reality it's okay to say you know we're
making this card or we're going to split
target crypto currencies or blockchain
and gaming 50/50 okay no big deal
just do it and we're all cool or you say
we're not letting miners get ahold of
this oh no only gamers will get this
card if they can find it and afford it
and yeah also it's a blockchain
pioneering card so that's Vega
just a quick throwback to remember how
hot this card was when we put it under
liquid cooling and this is the flashback
part of the episode we found if I
remember correctly that we were able to
reduce power leakage by about 30 watts
by putting both the GPU and the HP I'm
under liquid which of course gave us
more power available to the core so we
could overclock the core a whole lot
higher and of course it operated still
cooler while also leaking less power
because just like with a CPU with a CPU
like this one which we'll get to in a
and the general reduction in power
consumption is maybe about every 10
degrees Celsius on a CPU you drop
something like 4 percent of your power
consumption through leakage so we were
able to fix some of that with our Vega
Frontier addition hybrid mod that was a
lot of fun to work on this year and we
later segwayed into the Vega 56 hybrid
mod where we were able to sort of hack
the power play tables via registry and
get its power consumption up to 406
watts
along with some some additional changes
we later did a BIOS flash with a 64 BIOS
on 256 and that got us up past well past
Frontier Edition and 64 stock in fact
once you do the flash we're really gonna
be at parity or slightly better and
further than that with 56 versus 6040
ten to overclock a bit higher on 56
because you've got fewer cores packed
into that area so the density is a bit
lower the sort of heat density as it
were is going to be a bit lower giving
you more Headroom for frequencies but
all that is a side point because
Frontier Edition is the one that was
truly disappointing it felt like a card
that was released specifically to hit
the first half 17 promise in fact not
only was it not sampled to media which
is completely fine medias not entitled
to samples we're happy to buy the
products I just spent $3,000 on Titan V
for that reason for the company to test
it and see what we can learn about it
but the point is it wasn't sampled it
wasn't really promoted that heavily and
it shipped with very buggy and complete
drivers and the key features weren't
even enabled and still kind of don't
really work that great so to quote
Linus's recent video it's early access
hardware which i think is a great thing
to call Vega frontier Edition it was a
let's get this out the door to meet
investor promises and make sure that
they don't sue us and that's what they
did frontier Edition was shipped and
then you got 64 and 56 later which are
actually a bit better at a few of the
tasks then frontier Edition provided
that you don't need the extra two times
the memory capacity so that is Frontier
Edition in a nutshell that was basically
our month working with it wrapped up
very quickly
what about the other disappointing
components though there's also KB Lake X
which is so forgotten to history at this
point that I had to look at the sheets
to remember the name of it the Kami Lake
X processor family is just fascinating
to look at it was almost universally
hated and you can't really even the age
500 P wasn't universally hated I mean
it's still got some subjective elements
to it you could like it for its looks or
whatever they confront to your addition
although disliked it wasn't just
straight hated that's what was special
about kV Lake X it was really despised
by most of the consumers the enthusiasts
and media didn't really like it we don't
make it a habit to hate things it's not
really the right way to feel about a
product in general although sometimes
they do deserve it but this one was just
anomalous in almost every way it's a
different package size it's a different
socket type but it's a 7700 K refreshed
sure you can overclock it get one to two
hundred megahertz higher okay maybe that
has some value the engineering samples
that weren't sold to end-users had
amazing IMC's to the point that you
could hit much higher memory clocks on
those than on most other processors on
the market and that has something to be
said for it although they were mostly
engineering samples but Intel's primary
defense of the entire KB Lake X line
which for some inexplicable reason
contained an i5 CPU was it's an upgrade
path this is your gateway drug to X to
99 isn't it great you can spend $300 on
a processor $600 on a motherboard and
then in four months you can spend $1000
on a processor and upgrade it who
doesn't want to do that what a brilliant
idea
so that is KB like XO that's the primary
issue we had with that processor when it
came out and I think most other media
did too in fact not only is it just a
bad cost proposition bad value
proposition it instills a level of
confusion in the market that is just
completely unnecessary one good example
would be this motherboard which is sadly
collateral damage in this build I'm
sorry Asus it had to be someone and
yours wasn't an event
already this motherboard has eight
memory slots on it KB like X can use
four of those they're on the right side
of KB like eggs the CPU the other four
can't be used until you put in the
upgrade X 299 chips sorry we can't call
it X 299 coz k be like X is technically
X 299 a sky like X chip when you put one
of those and you can use the rest of
them this is just some extra confusion
to the market where when you look
outside of our circle outside of the
enthusiasts space a lot of buyers won't
necessarily know that and sure you can
read the manual figure it out but what
if you wanted to use eight dims maybe
that's the reason you got it and then
you bought the CPU because it's cheaper
and you really just need memory capacity
but that's kind of resolved partially
with language with media with things
like that with research so that's not
the only issue the primary issue I think
is that Intel launched how many
processors didn't I launch this year
let's go through that January CES
January 2017 one year ago was KB Lake
nan X that be these 7700 K the 7600 k 7e
573 50k G 45 60 G 4600 G all of those
processors you got the idea
KB Lake came out in January then there
was let's see we had skylake X we had KB
like X and we had coffee lake so in one
year Intel shipped several processor
lines that usurped one another
so the 7700 K came out in January and it
was unexcited sure wasn't a big jump
from the 6700 K and we didn't have the
reference point of Verizon yet but it
was a decent overclock or it performed
well in games if you didn't already own
a 6700 K sure it might be worth buying
shortly after that you get the 77 40 X
which comes out slightly better than the
7700 K - the IGP that was another weird
decision on their part and you put it
next to 99 and hey you have a great
motherboard that you can upgrade later
what she'll probably never do because by
the time you upgrade you might as well
buy something else after that just
months later comes the 8700 K which you
can buy a cheaper motherboard for you've
got the
processor for about the same price it's
actually better than the 77 40 X and
overclocks about the same if not better
it has a better thermal paste on it it's
got the HTC compound on it so the point
is it might feel kind of bad to buy a 77
40 X you get at least with KB lake nine
months before a coffee light comes out
and it's still kind of a decent
processor but you didn't spend quite as
much on it so trade-offs there the KB
Lake X family though was just odd and it
felt like Intel was just trying to
accelerate their launch schedule to a
point of cramming everything into one
year so that they can really push hard
next year to challenge whatever comes
out from AMD at that point then there
was the whole 12 Kate gaming thing which
we ran a separate content piece on this
pertains asked I like X and KB wake act
it was basically Intel saying you can
have three 4k monitors because three
times 4k equals 12 K obviously everyone
knows that if we get maybe we can get
some pixel counts on the screen to show
that that was sarcasm but the point is
Intel was big on this 12 K gaming idea
which is of course very popular and
everyone is getting into this year so 12
K gaming as we felt it unsurprisingly is
primarily limited to your GP is more
than anything if you can even afford
three 4k monitors and if you consider
that 12 K they also said that skylake X
with the 700 X was better at vr gaming
it's the best it's better than the 7700
K which is just objectively false unless
you overclock it to a point of being
better as we proved in objective VR
benchmarking with actual numbers so
Intel had its own share of marketing
oddities this year as did a nd they all
pretty much did that's what companies do
but its end of year so we thought we'd
recap some of them just for a bit of fun
now that's not to say these companies
didn't launch good things they all did
and they even had marketing that was
also equally good but it's good to look
at the missteps to try and correct for
them next time and then we have this the
H 500 P which I think we've kind of
talked about enough at this point so I
don't know that it needs a revisit but
just for fun I'll put a thermal chart on
the screen where we ran tests on this
specific build we hadn't done that
or and it got pretty hot things
throttled vrm was getting hot up to high
70s 80s when it was starting the test
and then starts accelerating at that
point towards throttle territory but not
quite added this vrm throttles at about
a hundred degrees Celsius from a an
external thermocouple measuring with the
chokes or the calves whereas in reality
the internal temperatures probably
throttling about 110 C is where this
board sits but that really wasn't the
worst part VR Emison take a lot of heat
anyway that's just SPID telling the the
vrm to throttle
via the protocol from the cpu and you
can disable that and still have largely
the same issues but anyway the point is
that the video card was approaching 90
degrees celsius was throttling its
clocks as a result and then the cpu
wasn't too happy either it was sitting
about 60 to 70 Celsius most the time
with a 360 millimeter cooler on it
albeit not one of the best ones we we
were not really that impressed this
fractal cooler this year either but
that's the whole point of the
disappointment build and how isn't it so
yeah it gets a bit warm 60 seventies
with a 360 rad and some burning software
burning on both the GP and the cpu
simultaneously if you want more numbers
on H 500 P that are more properly laid
out and we have the methodology and
consistent comparisons between
everything else check the reviews
because that's where you'll find it this
was just a quick ad hoc test to say like
look it's kind of fun to see how hot
this computer gets because it's got some
hot components in it but the age 500 P
has one primary potential Savior and
that's that cooler master told us they
are actually and why I say told us I
mean one of their employees tweeted at
us when we started talking on this case
that they are looking into a mesh front
panel so at least that's what it sounded
like so maybe there's something there
that would help a lot but that's I think
we've really set it off about the H 500
P it doesn't it's it's a little fresher
in the mind doesn't it has much of a
revisit as the other two parts if you
want to see stuff about it we have
plenty of content on all of these and
again
this isn't to say these companies are
bad is to say these products were in
different ways disappointing and
hopefully everyone can sort of live with
that because we're not trying to say
that Coolermaster or AMD or Intel only
made bad things this year we're just
saying these three specifically all
together make for a a very fun build in
fact it was so fun that just running
thermal tests on it took me about an
hour and a half to get set up because I
had various issues with each of the
components in the build so it lived up
to its name immediately it was genuinely
disappointing even though it was really
just supposed to be kind of a joke at
the beginning it took more time to
troubleshoot and get everything working
properly to a point that we were happy
with it using the stress testing
software we used to run the numbers so
