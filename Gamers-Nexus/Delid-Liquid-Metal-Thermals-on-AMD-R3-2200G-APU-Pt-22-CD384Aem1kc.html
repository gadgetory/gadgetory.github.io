clean as using the pre-built tools for
Intel CPUs but we have a separate video
that'll show the deal in process to
expose the APU die this new apu uses
thermal paste rather than andy's usual
solder which isn't likely a cost-saving
measure for the low-end parts we ran
stock thermal tests on our 2200 g using
the included cooler and a 280 millimeter
X 62 liquid cooler then deleted it
applied thermal grizzly conductor not
liquid metal and ran the tests again
today we're looking at that thermal test
data to determine what sort of Headroom
we gain from the process of removing the
stock thermal paste and replacing it
with liquid metal just like we deal with
Intel CPUs before we get into that this
video is brought to you by the EVGA
sleeved wire combs people often ask me
what my hair care routine is and it's
the same as any self-respecting
enthusiasts cable management routine I
use the EVGA sleeves wire combs to
neatly organize each individual strand
of hair just like how they can tidy up
individual cable wires in your system
the cable comb kit includes two 24 pin 2
8 pin 4 PCIe and a couple of peripheral
sleeved wire combs learn more at the
link in the description below so this
was actually really cool it's pretty fun
because the delayed process here
normally we can use something like this
this is a deal a dime 8 X from their
Bower or one of these from rocket cool
and they make the process pretty
foolproof and overall safe today we
basically put a rise in CPU or the APU
into a vise clamped the IHS on one side
and clamps the substrate on the other
side and they just applied pressure
until they broke free with a
prescription of razors included yes this
is where I keep them so we got it all
working put liquid metal on there it is
thermal grisly conduct or not and the
improvement is noteworthy it's very
similar to what we see with Intel before
getting into the data some disclaimers
here about safety don't do this at home
unless you're willing to risk the APU
it's fortunately pretty cheap part so
not a big deal to replace it and also on
being worth it people like to say this
about Intel CPUs where
they'll say like you have to deal with
them no you don't you don't have to deal
it Intel you don't have to deal with the
AP use for them to perform within
reasonable spec when you should deal
with them is when you would like to have
some actual thermal Headroom so that you
can reduce the fan speed so that extra
Headroom means that we can bring the fan
speed down and operate at the same
temperature as before with a quieter
mode of operation alternatively it gives
you more thermal Headroom for
overclocking or of course it gives you
room to use a smaller cooler if you
don't want to buy a 280 you can get a
240 or an air cooler and you've got the
Headroom there because you've deleted it
and the thermal transfer between the die
to the IHS is now going through a 73
watt per meter Kelvin liquid metal
rather than four or whatever it is for
the thermal paste so this is a process
that from an enthusiast perspective is
worth it but from a practical
perspective will depend entirely on your
needs because you can just throw a
bigger cooler on it and get basically
the same effect so we're not trying a
serious overclock here for our
overclocked numbers quotes there we have
it had 3.8 gigahertz that's not a big
jump and we've got it at one point four
volts the point was not to push it as
far as we could the point was to
generate a very reliable set of thermal
data that could be done from just
pushing a lot of voltage through it and
frankly instability on these ApS is such
that it was just hard enough getting
them to work at all with any kind of
overclock on any board
we found the a C's crosshair six hero to
be basically the most reliable for a
thermal test data and so we used that we
had issues with the asrock pro 4 for a
few reasons weight issues with the MSI B
through 50 board see the timing video on
that issues all around but we use the
crosshair finally we're using delta T
over ambient for the numbers here so
that means it is a delta between ambient
and the core temperature which is why
the numbers will appear lower if you
don't know that already and also t
control is gone and ii got rid of t
control which is the offset that would
apply a 20 to 27 degree offset value to
t die previously and call that t control
so they've gotten rid of that
and yeah that's pretty much all the
disclaimers so let's get into the
thermal numbers this first chart just
establishes our base lines with the
stock IHS we don't have any delayed
numbers on here yet before deleting took
place and using the crosshair six hero
with full auto settings and a crack in X
62 our baseline for TDI is 39 degrees
Celsius delta T over ambient this is
with a 10 second high at about 39
degrees as well so very consistent data
we operated at around 2.6 degrees
celsius when idle manually configuring
the CPU to run at 3.8 gigahertz and 1
point 4 volts give us a core temperature
of 47 degrees over ambient which was
about 25 degrees during all tests this
increased our temperature over baseline
by about 7 degrees idle is subsequently
higher running at around 4 to 4 point 7
degrees the air cooler ran at about 56
to 57 degrees over ambient and that put
TDI at around 81 degrees for the
reported temperature with the 3.8
gigahertz and 1.4 volt configuration
failing to complete the test the CPU
measured at 69 degrees before thread
failed at which point we considered the
test to be incomplete we weren't able to
achieve stability with this high of a
voltage despite the frequency not being
overclocked in any meaningful way
subsequently we also disabled the
cooling fan momentarily to determine
what t.j.maxx is on these ap use or what
temperature the thermal protections it
would be enabled this turns out to be
about 95 degrees Celsius T died at which
point we start seeing throttling on the
frequency side of things and you'll
eventually hit a shutdown if your
motherboard enables it if we add our
ambient to about 25 degrees back to the
T die of 69 in the event of the
incomplete or DNF test we're at 94
degrees celsius which happens to align
with TJ max moving to the deleted
thermals chart the one that you're all
interested in we're using conductor not
here for the application but still using
our standard test pace on the IHS which
we manually applied and spread over the
service with a graduated syringe to make
sure it was the same amount of paste
each time we immediately saw a 14 degree
reduction in temperature between the X
62 thermal paste at 3.8 gigahertz and
one point 4 volts and the X 62 with
liquid metal using the same frequency
and voltage
the dee-lighted variants using conductor
not operates at about thirty two point
six degrees over ambiens versus 47
degrees over ambient for the default and
the if they're all pasted that's a
significant improvement in thermal
headroom and quick notes here we allow
these to run for thirty minutes at a
time so you can check the data on that
and the article linked below if you need
more info on the overtime performance
and note also that we removed the
silicon adhesive from the IHS but we
left it on the substrate as a guide for
remounting the heat spreader we've
tested this on Intel before and I found
that you might gain another one or two
degrees max 3 by removing all silicon
adhesive and it's just generally not
worth it so we left the adhesive on the
base of the substrate for a guide and
thinned it out then remove the rest from
the IHS this is already a major
improvement idle remains about the same
as expected liquid temperature is also
functionally equivalent and within error
margins but for the auto test with
liquid metal which operated at nearly an
identical power load we observed a
twenty eight point seven degree over
ambient core temperature marking an
eleven degree drop from the stock
they're all pasted with our air coolers
the auto configuration drew only a
couple watts more than the throne paced
test entirely within variance but still
managed to perform at forty three point
six degrees delta T over ambient
comparatively this puts the stock air
cooler at a reduction of roughly
thirteen degrees versus the baseline
stock Tim from AMD that feels weird to
say Tim from AMD it's not just Intel
anymore and he is now using thermal
paste as well although only on the low
end stop with the air cooler running at
3.8 gigahertz and one point four volts
sort of an overclock the performance
report was now fifty two point five
degrees over anime and for the liquid
metal version or 69 degrees for the
stock paste that's a 17 degree
difference and it was enough of a change
that we were able to actually fully
survive the 30 minute burnin test pass
when using liquid metal despite failure
with the stock APU thermal interface
material as for power consumption this
chart illustrates the power consumption
for a deleted and a stock test pass
which ensures that we're pulling the
same amount of current at the EPS
12-volt rails for each test this is part
of our means to validate that our test
data is
and you can find more of this discussion
in the link in the description below for
the article will also include a power
chart table in the article for test
validation purposes and on the note of
power we basically keep a current clamp
on the 8 pin power cables going into the
motherboard so that be the 12 volt
cables and use that to measure power
consumption which we can then plot over
time versus temperature to make sure
it's drawing the same amount of power
for each test so there's no
inconsistency that gets through from
prime or a blender or whatever the test
software may be for each test overall
ultimately this is somewhat of a risky
endeavor
again there's no pre-made tool you can't
just buy something from rocket cool
order power and get something that makes
it easy to deal with rather safely there
Bowers do you add eye mates for example
only exists for Intel why would anyone
make something for Andy because they're
all soldered in the past so if you want
to do this you're basically on your own
it's not that difficult but there is
certainly more risk of screwing up
personally speaking I have not deleted
something by using a vise before but it
worked fine and logically it made sense
you just protect the substrate put it on
one side and then clamp the IHS now we
did do a good bit of thinning out that
he so first the razor but it's not too
hard overall so ignoring the aspect of
getting it done is it worth actually
deleting these CPUs or the AP isn't
putting liquid metal on it it's actually
it depends so it comes down to if you
have an issue with the noise of your
system like fan noise you could reduce
the fan speeds by deleting it that gives
you another 10 degrees or so of headroom
under the workloads we tested which
would then allow you to run the fans at
a lower rpm while maintaining the same
temperature as previously that's one of
the advantages that people don't really
talk about if you have a thermal
Headroom issue like we did with the
stock cooler and the somewhat aggressive
voltage and the thermal paste test run
then going liquid metal could help with
that too if you just have a weak cooler
this is primarily something that allows
you to reduce fan speeds use a smaller
or lower powered cooling device
and achieve the same effect as
previously in terms of temperatures or
just get some extra Headroom for
overclock and if you really need those
last couple degrees so just like with
Intel CPUs the change is not necessary
you don't need to deal with the APU or
the Intel CPUs either of them to get
decent performance out of the box it's
just it's a nice thing to do if you
already have objectives in mind where it
would help so certainly pretty fun to
test and the results were good now you
wait 13 to 17 degrees at the low and the
high end that's a pretty big difference
so for that we used just liquid metal
manually applied it and then manually
spread their own pace on the top mounted
the cold plate and that was it so as
always you can go to the channel check
