net and this is our weekly game news
recap so we're going over the news for
the games industry in the last week and
we have another video coming up with the
hardware news for the week so check that
out the first item is called duty black
ops 18 or whatever it is now and that
just released about probably a little
more than 24 hours ago at the point of
this video being uploaded and the game
is a call of duty game you shoot things
you run around and you dolphin dive it
takes some elements from titanfall like
wall running and parkour and actually
has a free running mode which kind of
reminds me of mirrors edge 2 some
somewhat limited extent and we tested
those on various video cards we're
working on testing them on CPUs tested
it in memory all that stuff the gameplay
I will say from my very limited actual
playing the game time is call of duty so
high you know what that's like if you
like it or not then that's what it is so
there's no new revolutionary big thing
there but in terms of the performance
the GPUs have some issues in a few
places but generally you'll get by
playing on 1080p with maxed out settings
on about a GTX 970 you can go down to a
960 or r9 380 if you drop some settings
like anti-aliasing and things like that
we have a whole video describing all
this so check that out if you're
interested but the end of the day it is
a new black ops call of duty game
there's single-player there's
multiplayer and the only thing anyone is
ever going to do is multiplayer so
that's out there now and check out our
content on the channel for more on that
in terms of other big news items
rockstar games GTA 5 recently cause
trouble for steam for valve not for
rockstar this time for once and the
trouble was that valve posted an
advertisement during one of their recent
sales about GTA 5 being twenty-five
percent off so the advertisement was
misleading and led users to believe that
it was discounted
52 pounds 239 pounds this was a UK ad
and that was actually not the case it
was it discount only for a bundle of
rockstar titles so several GTA titles
and did not apply to the individual game
in the same fashion and in response to
this even though it's been a few months
now the a-si which is a UK authority has
come down on valve and had a ruling
stating that the game was on a
misleading sale it was not true to the
consumers what was going on with the
actual price was and the very hard
reality for valve is that they're not
allowed to run that again so kind of a
slap on the wrist not actually a harsh
reality what happened is the a-si and
valve agreed that it was a problem that
it was an unintentional and erroneous
placement of the ad on the standalone
game and valve will not be running the
hat again in the future quite obviously
and they even pulled and corrected the
ad within a few hours of finding out its
placement in error previously a few
months ago so that's all there is with
the rock star and valve issue that's
been resolved now the next two items are
related and that is a Witcher 3 live
action movie and then a world of
warcraft movie so the warcraft one you
may have already seen the trailer it's
been on YouTube for a little while now
and that is coming to theaters soon it
is the world of warcraft universe and
i'll be honest i actually was an
EverQuest player 1 and later too but I
don't really talk about that and I never
played wow was not interested in it at
all I recognize its importance but I was
not a player i was in EverQuest True
Blood player so that said Warcraft is
coming out as a movie and whether or not
you were a fan or player of wow it is
actually kind of important to pay
attention to in the games industry
because the success and reception of wow
by a greater audience will sort of
determine and helped shape how games and
movies
interact in the future and where the
crossovers are so that'll be kind of fun
to watch and pay attention to regarding
perhaps the more traditional film critic
industry's response versus the games
industry's response to the movies launch
in terms of The Witcher 3 or The Witcher
rather I should say not the witcher 3
the witcher is getting its own
live-action placement in a new movie and
this is based on the novel so it's not
like it's just based on the game because
the game is based on the novels as well
and there's a studio that I don't know
how to pronounce called platys or I'll
do the American thing here planted films
and that has announced that its joining
another company Sean Daniel company to
work on The Witcher movie the studio
working on this hopes that it will
become a series in the long run but for
now it's one movie it's been in
pre-production I'm not entirely sure if
it's exited pre-production yet but it's
on the way so we've got the witcher and
world of warcraft in terms of movies
coming out from the games industry and
then the final news item for the week is
Paragon which is epic games newest kind
of teased game they didn't really
actually provide any tangible
information we know that there's a guy
who exists in a game with an unknown
genre and the guy's name is twin blaster
and he looks like he lifts so that's
about all we know Paragon is probably
from my own speculation going to be a
MOBA or a team shooter or something like
that just based on strictly the looks
one thing that we do know is that the
graphics shown in the teaser video are
going to be in-game graphics that is
representative of in-game renders which
means that it's pretty high fidelity
graphics content and it is a pc game so
that's always exciting will certainly
benchmark that whenever it comes out
it's coming out sometime in 2016 we
don't know when we don't know what the
genre is all we know is that Epic Games
will continue to announce new characters
or they're calling them heroes which
again leads me to believe team shooter
or MOBA they're announcing those once a
week starting last week and there's more
coming out through the next couple of
weeks into the four
week of December so we'll be following
that if anything substantial and worth
reporting comes out then I will
certainly follow up and provide a more
in-depth look at the game but as it
stands now we're very limited on
knowledge of what Paragon is and what it
hopes to do so that is all for this
week's news roundup check the link in
the postural video for our patreon page
