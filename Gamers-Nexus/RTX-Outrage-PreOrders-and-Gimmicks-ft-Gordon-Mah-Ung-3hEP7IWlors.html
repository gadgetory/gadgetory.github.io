joined by a special guest
Gordon ma on from PC where Aldi if you
don't know who Gordon is Gordon's been
in the industry a while
maximum PC right for a long time plenty
of others magazines I guess yeah oh man
back when they still use paper yes and I
have a lot of respect for the work
Gordon's done in the industry and he's
got some of the some of the best ethics
in the industry so I wanted to bring
Gordon on and talk about the r-tx
watch or announcement as it were before
that this video is brought to you by Lee
Anne Lee is 11 dynamic a case largely
designed by overclocker dare bower for
high-performance water-cooling though
our performance testing also Illustrated
strong air cooling performance the 11
dynamic is affordable high build quality
and offers a unique form factor case
with dual PSU support by one now at the
link in the description below so I where
where do we start with this
so I mean because it feels like it
changes every hour because there's new
leak benchmark saying it's faster than
this or faster than that it definitely
feels to me like they're sort of
controlled leaks because nvidia is try
to reclaim sort of the narrative on this
card yeah which I honestly think no I'm
gonna ask you Steve because you're the
number one person like you are I looked
it up in the internet like when you
looked up RTX 2080 don't buy it it's got
your picture I want to note though are
we getting a little too far down the
hate it's gone from people saying I want
to know to people are cheering it
feeling do you think that that's way too
far
yeah that's taking it wait like if
you're cheering for failure of a
hardware that's taking it way too far I
think sure because if someone's cheering
for failure of a component and it
indicates that they have a bias
somewhere else right which is either
against the company they want failure of
or for the other company and both of
those that does make sense
like the companies aren't your friends
sure so yeah if anyone's cheering for
failure I'd say that's taking a little
too far right I mean I Eltham Utley this
comes down to when you get the hardware
in your hand
Brad's gonna get ours we're gonna test
cards is it gonna be worth it that's
right that's when we should ultimately
judge it right yes that is the bottom
line
yeah so I need your credit card because
I need to preorder that now it's it's a
bit pricey right it's a little up there
there's a lot of discussion on that here
okay here's my question no no I love
playing devil's advocate that is a lot
of people think those are my pins I have
no opinion I'm a nihilist right I just
if they come up with the twenty eighty
and they said oh this is three
times faster than a 1080 TI $1100 would
people go like yeah or they'll be like
yeah that's hard to say right I think it
depends on the audience like it depends
on who it is because if you're we were
talking about this type of person who
gets hyped about that kind of
performance they have the lifestyle that
can support it they don't care about the
price and it's cool to be excited about
it but you do have to obviously be
responsible sure with what you're
spending but everybody what I'm saying
is everybody's like all right you're a
choice is useless isn't that dumb is
gimmick ever but if they'd said 3.5 x at
4k HD all right well that $100 then
you're then you're talking numbers that
people today understand people
understand rasterization right and frame
rate and yeah so if the response I think
if if Nvidia marketed the frame rate
angle with 4k or whatever it be
something everyone understands a bit
better so the response probably have
been completely different but I don't
think that's the right thing they should
have done but that's no no this is them
trying to to make that right or left
turned away right I guess I wonder I
just don't I so much of is about the
price because people like I want I want
ten atti performance at a 10 60 price
right that's just right that just I what
what do you think what would you if you
were not in editorial land and you were
a consumer what would you reasonably
want to pay for one of those cards I
would
honestly I sort of wished that 2080 were
a little more palatable maybe a hundred
dollars less of these sort of I don't
even know at the prices anyway because
it's like it's 700 today it's 600
tomorrow I don't even know what it is
but if it were 550 I'd feel a lot better
yeah I would feel a lot less nervous so
I mean definitely people are really
nervous as hell right now and you know
we were just in this panel and in Pedro
forum PCMR was like yeah you know in
fact they don't talk about performance
it was very concerning right so people
are very very constricted skepticism I
think too because especially on our site
because if you see that there's no
discussion of performance I think the
kind of the natural response is what are
they hiding and it might be nothing
oh yeah it could also be something so I
guess the way marketing works of these
companies you always assume that what
you're getting is not the full picture
and that there's something else to be
discovered but that's not always the
case obviously right so but on the ray
tracing part so yeah we hear all the
hate on the ray tracing I don't need
it's a gimmick it's a gimme gimme gimme
how does in video pivot to give us to
bring us a ray tracing well still giving
us a part that makes everybody happy
with their current current library
you're 99 percent of your library I
okay so we've we've teleported because
there's noise because we're at a
convention so we were saying so we were
saying before a whole bunch of Radeon
fans ran us off the floor that came up
with chases up yes get out
yeah I have one beer so I'm making think
of that so what we talked about we're
talking about like how do you how does
how does it do that how do you do it
yeah how do you get raytrace and if
that's really what we need right now
right if that's if that's the next thing
and we can't do much with with other
graphics techniques until we get ray
tracing how do you do that and solve the
chicken or the egg problem of developers
don't have the hardware so they can't
make the games right and consumers don't
have games so they don't want the
hardware right all right I don't
somebody has to go forward right
somebody has to take that first time and
that to me is like that's why I feel
real like it's kind of unfortunate I'm a
great racing dog but yeah at the same
time am I gonna fund a game that's not
gonna come up for hardware for games
they don't really listicle II come out
for three to four years yeah cuz I mean
as a as a consumer if that's fully the
case I would wait because what's the
point of having it if you can't really
use it right so it's kind of like buying
a 4k TV back in the day when there's no
4k content right I got other than being
cool I you know it's there's not a ton
of point to it so yeah definitely that's
that's a big challenge
it's like though it's like the folks and
we know them who went out and they
bought 4k panels yeah four years ago
right they've been sitting on these
$2,500 4k panels for four years now you
probably can run 4k Kanye and you can do
it on a hundred and eighty dollars yeah
that's probably actually better than
that $2,500 4k it's a stiff I mean I
understand that that's that's that's
different it's too fast right yeah as
long as they're still good performance
just in normal shaders and rasterization
I guess you can you can justify it and
until we see performance numbers and run
the test ourselves we obviously can't
really you know make a firm they're not
pretty buying it you're not pre-ordering
it
well lying I saw his order yeah got like
three of them on oh that's right we
bought all do that video just so he
could buy so I could get them all I
wanted them all for myself
yes all right well I wouldn't be by as a
consumer anyway
whereas matter what card it is we were
talking about this early and I just
gotta ask who who's who goes out and
just puts down a thousand dollars for
something ain't even know what it is it
really does that I've never that is a
new thing to me
I've been around PC enthusiasts for
forever but pre-orders and stuff
nice I don't know I think so first of
all if you've pre-ordered it it's not
personal you know we don't we don't we
don't hate you but it is a good question
though and I think a lot of it comes
from like the the game developer culture
where we've been pushed into
pre-ordering games to get special
treatment or something so people have
gotten used to that right oh my god
you're right you know those who buy r-tx
20/80 right
news breaking news gamers Nexus can tell
you this right now yes you preorder RTX
2080 two extra levels two extra levels
that's a three anyway no I'm making that
up
yes two for wine get nothing so you get
nothing you gotta have to pre-order this
you get it first that's what you get but
it is fair it is fair if you're rolling
around a Ferrari who cares I'm buying
this to make you feminine at and if I
owned Ferrari I would buy the 2080 TI
just two of them just to make you feel
bad
yeah there's nothing wrong with that
because if I had a Ferrari who cares I
don't care what you think right yeah
other than that no never
other than that general consumer our
audience I I wouldn't it's not I know
some people from Nvidia that mentioned
this at their event to where they were
sort of saying to me hey people are
saying don't few order this and I felt
bad about it but I don't know we don't
it's not it's not just RT X it's just in
general any hardware that you don't know
anything about yeah why would you ever
I wouldn't preorder an Intel or AMD CPU
without any benchmarks either no so it's
crazy but you know what I just heard I
heard 1900 K it's gonna have soldering
oh yeah I saw that
yes and it looks like it's real this
time so alright so I'm gonna I'm gonna
bring this up if somebody has wondered
for years because we hear one half what
half the internet says no solder sucks
paste is just as good in the forest you
know some people and I have somewhat
defended in telling this in the past you
know they sort of know they you know
it's a billion-dollar company
multi-billion they know what they're
doing yeah if they're saying that they
can do this on pace then maybe it's okay
now they're making us all look like
fools right if they really do solder
then they're like coming on saying yeah
okay solder is better all right and you
would tell an S the solder doesn't
matter right yeah it's gonna crack or
whatever so I I don't I don't know how
to square that I mean it really does
make me feel like an idiot
well hey but I am an idiot most of them
that's not true
let's you do good work or no no keep
keep your head in the game
oh yeah I just don't I just don't get it
cuz I I how do you square that if like
if paste good but now solder better and
you've been
pace is good but III think I mean it
comes down to they didn't need to use
solder and now if you're trying to give
into our stock is trying to get an extra
hundred megahertz or whatever they might
need that thermal Headroom right yeah
it's true and it matters now because now
they it's not just Intel versus Intel
any all right yeah it's a really good
point Steve because to get to to eight
cores with this chip you need it
all those cores eight core solder good
it's gonna be hot 79 80 16 core space no
right yeah it's a mass I don't know like
I could understand like okay whatever a
six core 87 through ka you're in the
cheap seats you're not getting soldered
we're gonna do the solder on the Xeon
part but 79 80 X he was sorry
no he's pissed yeah I know it really
there's no way that in topi come back
and say we did this because no I mean
yeah there's it's it's very clear that
it was never the case that actually
paste is the best right I mean that's
pretty obvious Intel's more or less
indirectly admitting it by soldering the
next CPU so yeah I don't know I don't
know how to square that especially if
you have a two thousand dollar 18 core
CPU with yes with thermal paste on earth
right yeah that was not really tenable
to me like I was deleting 79 80 xes for
other youtubers because they want to
overclock it or use it you know in
high-end applications and it should be
soldered but this is just as good as
solder I saw it I've been told is they
it's why would they why would they do
that well the arguments are that solder
on a I think it was a smaller die cracks
or something right but or micro
fractures Saturday night at EDX C's
pretty big died yes that's what I never
and there's no solder on that I don't
know I I don't I can't explain it I
can't I can't I don't know what to say
there it just what to do
would you welcome the change moving the
solder do you care you know I'm not one
to deal in two thousand dollar CPUs and
I'm not one profited D
five hundred dollars GP because I like
warranties hmm but I would hope I would
expect that it is a premium part even
though it's just in a paper box
cardboard box that they would do the
absolute best to make it better for
end-user so I got to say I'm a little if
really this eight core part comes out
and it's it's soldered and it really
just it's a complete about-face it's
kind of disappointing I gotta say yes
you know there's really no way to like
to square that I I think it really does
they should just come out say yeah yeah
sorry sorry you got a spare for us cuz
look we got 50 more dollars from the
CPUs yeah yeah yeah that is a bad as
it's gonna be a hard it's gonna be tough
one to swallow yes I'll I'll be happy to
see it I guess but definitely it's it
leaves you a little bit a little bit
skeptical of the reasoning we've heard
for the past CPUs whereas like you're
saying it looks like they could do it
the whole time yes that's right if you
if you can do the solder and they
whatever 450 or 500 bucks but you can't
do it on a $2,000 you it does make you
wonder yeah what's up yeah I don't know
so are you are you happy with the
current industry trends then with we've
got Intel pushing for maybe solder that
looks good that's good we have Nvidia
trying to do something new that's maybe
good we all will see right how do you
feel about the overall direction of the
big three companies I gotta say overall
it's wonderful a lot of ways thread
Ripper got some weaknesses yeah but
still awesomeness for 32 cores for that
price Intel pushin eight core super high
clock good part we don't know what
they're gonna do with the 28 core part
that comes out later but the least
they're trying so all that competition
is driving that price is awesome also
Nvidia clearly trying to pivot is gonna
make it I don't know should you do it I
don't know find out and find out my the
biggest weakness is AMD Radeon right yes
really need a me
just do something yeah yeah my concern
is is aim D falling behind too much
because we it's clear with the way
companies actually getting these
dominant positions you really want that
competitor and it's got to be more than
just the underdog at some point so yeah
and the Navi has really gotta prove
itself a bank but if it isn't a heavy
rate racing part and md says hey look we
can get you a 120 frames a second at 4k
HDR right versus 1080 rate race 4k we're
gonna be like going like this right
what's your prediction on which way the
consumers are gonna go do they want way
more frame rates at high res or do they
want really cool ray trees without a lot
of of reeducation towards ray Tracy and
I think right now would probably go
towards frame rate because that's what
everyone understands but we've seen
these schisms before where you kind of
get two paths and it's like frequency
your core is there something like that
so then just she's gone through before
it's gone through with memory before and
I don't know I don't know which way it
would go I I would I
I feel like it's gonna go rasterization
but NVIDIA has a lot of marketing money
so and they have a lot of MDF they can
give the game developers and really get
ray-tracing Rowling's so which isn't
necessarily bad right right somebody's
got to get the ray-tracing ball started
yeah that's got to be fair but I heard
you're already a pre-order navvies so
that's that's I actually have one yeah
yeah yeah yeah Roger gave it to me
before he left
yes took it out of the prototype lab you
have to say don't tell any of us buy it
I think right just buy it just fine just
buy it so there you go Gordon telling
you just buy it
Debbie just Navi just just bite this
button yeah I've already poured it
I just put $500 in envelope and I wrote
AMD I need to see the mail sit it off
did the the mailman look pretty happy
with this there was a way address like
okay off to Santa thank you Andy
all right well if you wanted to see more
Gordon he's got a podcast that's pretty
cool you're on it recently on the PC
world channel on YouTube I believe
and with PCWorld calm with the website
look home yes so check them out there
Gordon thank you for joining me for the
time we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
