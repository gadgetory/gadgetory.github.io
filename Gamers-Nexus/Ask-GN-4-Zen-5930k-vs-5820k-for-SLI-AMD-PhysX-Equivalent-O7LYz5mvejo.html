donna and this is another ask GN video
this is our fourth episode i believe of
ask GN and i'm pretty excited with how
they've gone so far actually because the
questions that you all proposed have
actually sort of inspired us in a few
ways to do some new articles new tests
things like that and it's gotten us to
think about hardware in sometimes ways
that we haven't before or we haven't
done it a long time so please keep the
questions coming a post them below on
this video i check the most recent ask
GN video first before filming the next
one and i normally film only one day in
advance so I'm trying to do these every
monday at this point so today the first
question we have is a pretty simple one
it's from sorry about the pronunciation
here nishant chikara who says any news
on amd's NCP you launched so i just
posted an article about this and the AMD
Zen architecture for those who don't
know is Andy's next architecture
following the bulldozer piledriver
steamroller lineup which we are
presently on so the current kaveri apu
czar using steamroller modules in them
which used to be called bulldozer
modules still kind of correct but
they're upgraded and the next
architecture from andy is the zen
architecture and that has so far a lot
of hype behind it there were a couple
rumors from motherboard manufacturers
who were unnamed as told to i believe it
was digit times maybe i think it was
digit times said that unnamed
motherboard sources predicted a
40-percent performance gain with zen
over the current architecture that's a
very big claim so mountain of salt with
that it's not verified but that's sort
of what we know so far in terms of the
launch date there's no hard launch date
as of yet the current rumor is fourth
quarter 2016 that's about a year from
now and that's unconfirmed it could be
later could be earlier but I really
sincerely don't think it will be it's
we're looking at fourth quarter 2016 or
later at this point maybe third quarter
but I don't think that's going to be the
case dark drifter
best sub $100 cpu for gaming so
depending on how sub $100 you mean there
are a couple of options here the most
immediately one I would point toward
would be something like the 41 30 or 40
160 I three CPUs those are priced at one
hundred twenty dollars so it's not
technically sub 100 but it's very close
and the twenty dollars gets you a lot of
performance over the actual sub 100
dollar CPUs which would be the g3 258
pentium and the 860 k soon to be
replaced by the ATK in theory that ever
comes out so those would be the three to
look at if you can afford the i3 at
around 120 ish dollars it's it's very
good we found it to be basically unless
you're using a high on GPU that's going
to bottleneck on the cpu we found it to
effectively as good as most gamers will
need unless you're really starting to
push thread intensive games and there's
not a lot of those out there so if you
are doing thread intensive games you
probably already know that you are but
those would be things like the CryEngine
for instance has the ability to use all
the threads it doesn't always do that
but it's threaded for up to eight spawns
so it can spawn eight threads one of
those is the physics processing one is
the game logic and then you've got
rendering and all that other stuff in
there as well so CryEngine games have
the ability to use more threads but for
the most part you'll be just fine on an
i3 that said a lot of people will be
just fine on an 860 k as well and even a
g3 258 so unless you're playing like GTA
5 which we talked about in a similar
discussion previously then the 860 k and
the g3 258 are fine CPUs at the sub 100
dollar price point the g3 258 I think is
maybe five dollars cheaper than the 860
k which is a $75 CPU and the 860 k the
only reason I generally recommended over
the g3 258 which is still very good
penny mcp you is because the pentium the
g3 258 is it has trouble sometimes with
heavily multi-threaded games like GTA 5
it will push a high average FPS 75
the case of the most recent test I did
with a 980 TI it's pretty darn good for
normal settings on GTA 5 with a pentium
dual-core cpu but its point one percent
low numbers are not very good and i
think i talked about what those numbers
mean in episode 2 of ask GN so check
that out if you don't know but the point
1 percent low is on the pentium were
like for FPS something around the head
range and the 860 k even though i had a
lower average in the 60s average FPS the
point 1 percent was much higher to the
point where is actually more playable so
that is what you're looking at for the
sub 100 dollar range but if you can
afford the twenty dollars i would push
into the i3 area otherwise 860 k would
probably be one of my main go-to sg3 258
if you're not playing heavily
multi-threaded games and it overclocks
really well so throw that in there too
next question how r thompson says hey
Steve do you think the I 759 30k is that
all worth it over the I 758 20k to run
to 980 TI video card debt by 16 by 16 or
by sick by 16 by eight excuse me for 4k
gaming so the 59 30k in the 58th 20k
those are two x 99 CP is for those who
don't know will run through the specs
right quickly the more expensive one
would be the 59 30k it's in the 500 to
600 dollar range the other one the 58
20k is in the 309 de la range at last
check on newegg so those are the two
price points for x 99 without going into
the thousand-dollar really high-end cpu
area both of them are six core cpu is
both of them are clocked about the same
i think it's three point three gigahertz
where's is 3.5 somewhere in that range
and so you're getting a pretty small
clock increase but what's actually the
thing you're paying for is the PCIe Lane
count increase the 59 30k as 40 lanes
and the 5820 it has 28 lane so that's
what Homer is asking about here is is
the extra Lane count worth it to run two
video cards and x 16 x 16 versus being
forced down to x 16
x 8 or x 16 x 8 depending on how you
want to say it so the the lane
assignment here is definitely a thing to
research and be concerned about as
you're doing it's a good thing to ask
about but in general for the current
architecture GPUs they're not pushing on
a throughput to actually saturate that
by 16 PCIe 3-pointer face you're really
not going to have that much to worry
about at x 16 x 8 vs x 16 x 16 the
difference is negligible and this is
something that we're going to test and
publish soon i have tested it but not
comprehensively enough to publish charts
just yet it's something we're going to
do soon other websites have done it in
the past we're just going to refresh it
but if you're curious you can look at
past benchmarks that have done this
exact scenario different CPUs but exact
scenario otherwise and the general idea
is that because the throughput of pcie
3.0 is so high just with one lane you
with eight lanes with 16 lanes you're
going to see effectively identical
performance even an SLI now that said
you're instantly consuming all of your
lanes so if you run with the 28 lane
5820 k you're not going to have really
any lanes left over for other pci or
expansion devices so if you're running
we're hoping to run an m2 SSD the m.2
ssds will generally the good ones will
want four lanes dedicated to them or at
least two so do keep that in mind that's
where you start losing performance is
when you're trying to throw in other
PCIe devices or if it's not a PCIe
device keep in mind that other
interfaces will still use PCIe lanes so
an m dot to interface on the motherboard
will use PCIe lands from the chipset or
the CPU or somewhere in the system and
that's true for some other devices as
well to answer the question very
directly no is it is not worth it
strictly for that scenario but it is
worth it if you want the allowance for
another device so hopefully that makes
sense please let me know if anyone has
questions about the subject and the last
question for today is from Josh orenburg
as another question does Andy have
physics equivalent what's the situation
on the AMD side this is another good
question and this is one that's been
around for quite a while now physics got
its dawn when I gia was purchased by and
video or its patents were purchased by
Nvidia and that happened a number of
years ago so for those who don't
remember the company they made physics
processors so they basically took what
is now an extra GPU they made a physics
coprocessor they put it on a card you
put that on your pc i interface PCI
Express interface and then that handled
all of your game physics processing they
were actually pretty popular and they
were very high-performing toward the end
of their tenure so Nvidia bought that
technology and turn it into physics
which is a solution that now lives on
the GPUs and in the drivers of the video
cards that they produce physics will
technically run on AMD devices really
not always the best it doesn't always
work either so it just depends on the
game and how intensive it is but does
Andy have a physics equivalent no they
do not Andy is very good at things like
opencl and compute actually better than
a video in some ways but that doesn't
really show when a lot of games because
of how games are built and that's
something I discussed in the fury x
review check that out if you're curious
but Andy's where you get an open CL and
the also is basically optimizing for
things like the havoc engine which is a
physics engine that game developers use
is pretty popular one actually and build
into their games to handle all the
physics computations so when you're
using something like havoc some of that
will be it's basically software
accelerated physics so it does all the
processing and it's all coded through an
extra engine that is available to the
game developer so it's simplified for
them by the havoc team but then the GPU
depending on how its programmed is
capable of taking some of that
computation and running it itself rather
than sending it through the CPU which is
a sequential processor cpu is not very
good unless
there's some exceptions to modern CPUs
but in general they're not very good at
processing things that live much better
on parallel architectures like physics
does so Andy basically takes their
opencl advantage where it's applicable
they will use that advantage to do all
the processing on the GPU without
building their own physics equivalent
and it's not always possible so in the
cases where it's not they rely on things
like the havoc engine and other sauce or
accelerated engines or hardware
accelerated software solutions depending
on how you want to word it and they'll
rely on those to do the the work of
pushing the numbers around to different
devices there is no physics equivalent
out to answer the question very plainly
so that is all for this ask GN episode I
am currently on the way to another
meeting in another state so traveling
again but we'll have a lot more videos
once back and that will be on tuesday or
wednesday so back pretty shortly here
this time not gone very long and check
out the website for more articles
recently both wrote a big one about AMD
and the current situation it's got a lot
of financial information pretty heavy on
the number side it's also got a lot of
information just about recent launches
future launches like the fiji and zen
stuff that's going on so check that out
if you're curious about how the industry
is going and then of course the witcher
3 video we posted recently is pretty
cool too i think because talked about
the financials of the game industry and
what a game costs so that's all for this
time please post more questions below if
you have them I really appreciate them
they're pretty fun to work on and give
us a few article ideas as well if you
like this content as always hit the
patreon link in the post roll video
we've gone up another one or two patreon
supporters since the last time that I
mentioned it so big thanks to all of you
who have contributed thus far and we
hope more of you will jump on board and
support the site so check that out and I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
