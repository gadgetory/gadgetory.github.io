Radeon 7 V go graphics card we will be
disassembling it looking at the PCB and
the cooler the embargo for today does
not allow for performance reviews so
that's the only thing that is restricted
currently is the performance numbers
that would include thermals gaming stuff
like that but anything physically with
the card we can do for today so we're
gonna give you a look at the PCB and II
typically does pretty high on PCBs for
the reference cards they've been good in
the past now we're gonna look at the new
cooler which is a triple fan axial
design and see how it all kind of fits
together and if and you can use for your
screws then I suppose Nvidia that would
be the goal here today so let's let's
take it apart before that this video is
brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high-end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components Crona is particularly good
for replacing stock GPU pastes as cryo
not is a non curing compound learn more
at the link in the description below
so here's Radeon seven you can see this
is pretty similar if not the same as the
one that was at CES and it does not have
any secondary V BIOS which was a bit of
a change from previous AMD reference
designs but it is a PCB we need to look
at and see if it's high end similar to
the Vega cards they were actually pretty
good PCBs and Andy did well on those
designs the card itself has the same
screw placement for the most part as
previous Vega cards these are Torx I
think there are TR six screws and then
the rest of them are just Phillips for
the most part you can see that we have
the aluminum fin stack with either a
vapor chamber or I mean just standard
heat pipe cooling I that does kind of
look like well we'll see when we take it
apart it's hard to tell from here
actually there are heat pipes in there
and then dual or triple axial design and
this is actually sort of similar
although I don't have any reason to
suspect they use the same manufacturer
or anything but sort of similar to a
very old XFX design which beyond being
interesting there's not a whole lot to
be gained from knowing that it's just we
wanted to show it because the ghost was
kind of a cool series alright so let's
just get to taking it apart
we have some actual content here to look
at like I said I think these are tr6
that is typically what Andy uses for
torques so let's find that this is
actually torques 8 torques 8 but it's
not security torques so that's good that
makes it a bit easier to take apart in
the very least and there are 1 2 3 4 or
5 of these I don't feel any beneath the
stickers people like to hide stuff in
there sometimes we're gonna just place
these on the Gion mod mat which should
be shipping about now if you go to store
that gamers nexus net and you want a
work surface like this one you can find
one there to work on track screws get
wiring diagram stuff like that so we
have a couple more of these we'll speed
through them alright that was very easy
small hole here for a screw to come
through the PCB out of the IO and then
this placement is actually significantly
different from the other Vega cards
that's because the other ones have a
single fan and it's right here and they
use three smaller screws to hold those
in place with the recipe and larger
Phillips screws throughout the board
this one obviously a bit different given
that it is triple axial let's just
remove this bracket first and see if the
claw comes off easily does that say
warranty Boyd okay Andy we're gonna have
to have the talk here these stickers are
not enforceable in the US and just in
general its kind of ethically wrong to
discourage a consumer from maintaining
the product they they purchased there
are reasons to avoid a warranty this is
not one of them because there's no real
risk here and XFX does similar things
with theirs where they even got into a
an argument with us on Twitter where
ultimately kind of conceded and said
well we don't enforce it in the US like
because okay because you can't so it's
only enforced in regions where we can
screw people over so warranty void if
remove stickers we are very very much
opposed to these also does it say remove
yes
I mean it's not it's not removed anyway
it's uh it's modified it's not removed
though stickers still there so you could
argue that if you needed to all right
couple Phillips screws after this let's
see if that coolers loose though nope
so those screws are going into the base
plate which will secure the PCB to the
base plate now in the very least so far
this is about the same level of
difficulty as the r-tx cards the FE card
so that's good the question will come of
whether they can defeat NVIDIA and be
more complex and I think the answer will
be no Nvidia Zephie designs are
completely insane the way they're built
to a point that if you wanted to
complete disassembly a card and get
access to the fans to clean or CLE clean
or fix the fans or something like that
you would need to take out about seventy
six screws on the nvidia cards the
high-end ones and also you would need a
heat gun at like a couple hundred
degrees Celsius maybe uh and I think we
ran out like 400 Fahrenheit something
like that 500 Fahrenheit to melt the
glue because Nvidia uses glue so so far
Andy's doing a bit better than that
which is good to see
I think it will be easier to try and
remove the IO plate although one of
those screws is under the heatsink so
that will be a bit difficult so it's two
larger screws back here go into the
shroud of the cooler and then the rest
go into like the hdmi and displayport
connections so that pivots a bit oh
there's one more screw I missed in here
we're going to have to separate that
cabe all I see if their own pad trying
to come off - I just like to go on
record say and I specifically hate that
type of connector they're very difficult
to work with without ripping the
connector off the PCB itself but we did
it and Wow what oh my god alright so we
did a cut here to do some research and
this is actually a throne pad and if we
look really close I'd say it's a bit
better than just thrown paddle I'll tell
you exactly what it is in a second we
did figure that out but if you look
really closely and at the right angle of
light you will see that there's an
indentation of the HBM right here and of
the GPU right here so it is in fact
making full contact okay so kind of
difficult to show but there is in fact
indentations there showing contact so
it's making contact which is better than
what I suspected and that's because it's
a pad not a paste and we did some
research here and also reached out to
AMD and what we learned is that this is
a it's a new thermal interface what we
understand this is a Hitachi hm oh three
solution and we have the datasheet for
this so Hitachi's datasheet says I'll
just quote here it's a graphite resin
high thermal conductivity sheets that
they referred to as a graphite sheet in
which graphite filler is vertically
oriented that would be in this thin here
and it says although graphite material
has high thermal conductivity simplex
particles that themselves are hard so
they have problems in both flexibility
and adhesion therefore it was difficult
to achieve a good balance between
high thermal conductivity and
flexibility and then Hitachi goes on to
say how their solution fixes this
problem the datasheet also suggests that
it's got a thermal conductivity of 40 to
90 watts per meter Kelvin they say it's
an effective thermal conductivity which
may be orientation based I'm not sure of
25 to 45 and so this is a graphite sheet
is what this is and that is why part of
it got torn off here now like I said
we've already done all of our testing so
that's not gonna impact anything but
what I will be doing after this is
probably removing this sheet completely
and we have a couple test plans for it
and then well I won't go into them here
because well I mean we'll just just come
back for the review and you can see what
we do with it so there also be really
interesting for the review so
theoretically this has a higher thermal
conductivity than paste it's just that
what are the reasons for using it is the
question there are two primary reasons
we can think of one is that if am these
really time constraint here needs to get
this out the door this is potentially
faster to get done maybe fewer issues a
lot of people don't know that video
cards are typically assembled by hand
actually there's not much machine
involved at all so this might help there
alternatively it could be that this one
although it is all let's get a shot of
the diamond HBM here you can see that
this is a resin coated die so there's
functionally zero difference in height
like I mean there's not any difference
there I could measure it with tools and
we would see no difference that's
because it's resin or it's got an epoxy
resin on top of it and this is something
we saw before maybe we can find a shot
of our old pressure
paper test we did for Vega where some of
the dyes would be resin an epoxy coated
like this and others that were
manufactured in different facilities
would have died height differences
between the HBM and the GPU and this
caused some problems like for power
colors card previously so maybe the
thermal pad might be a solution to that
it's a bit thicker it should conform a
bit better so maybe that's a solution
but that's only going to be a solution
if Andi still has the multiple packaging
facilities creating different heights
between the HBM and the GPU and we're
not sure what the case is because we
have
sample size of one and known as posted
pictures yet because it's before embargo
lifts so we'll find out more about this
a bit later for the review let's go
through the rest of the cooler though
this this is very interesting I'm not
going to scrape any of it off right now
we'll do some other testing with this
stuff as for the rest so PCB is pretty
simple in terms of basic layout you've
got the the hookups here for fan cables
and for I guess LEDs or something power
for LEDs and then some thermal pads that
fortunately are easy to peel off this
time so this throne pad is on top of the
the vrm MOSFETs and we'll look more
closely at those right now and we have a
see let's see if I can read one of these
that's enough I international rectifier
35 401 M that one down there and we'll
talk to build will pitch the server to
builds alright I don't know if this is
an existing board designer Vega
memorized anymore but it does not look
say might be the same as the Instinct
stuff will ask him idat 1 4 7 to
international rectifier so there are how
many of these 1 2 3 4 on this this line
here and we have some other MOSFETs
under these pads so this is a sort of an
l-shaped vrm which is technically a bit
more efficient they can do this because
there's no G DDR memory it's all HB m on
the interposer which is on top of the
substrate so that does give more board
space to do your stuff this looks like
the same thing
this pads a bit different let's look at
this one that's because there's nothing
there ok so there's some spots for stuff
there but no actual MOSFETs this one
these are again I believe the same so we
end up with this for the vrm once we
take all the pads off here and again
we'll talk to builds right about this if
it's a new PCB then then we'll have him
do an analysis on it but there's our vrm
we also have
I'm items of interest on the back so
there's an IR 35 to 1 7 right here so 35
2 1 7 4 controller international
rectifier and then I think that's all
there is on the back mmm yes that that
pretty much sums up the back of the
board for areas of interest on the front
there's an another ir35 217 that's down
here and then we have another small vrm
component over here that looks like the
same ir parts that we saw a second ago
ok so that covers the PCB no secondary V
bios or anything like that but you get a
brief look at the v RM and some
interesting characteristics for the
thermal solution which will again we'll
talk more about that later but you do
have the basics you probably won't hear
elsewhere for a little while so that is
a Hitachi pad the HMO 3 graphite pads
sort of interesting solution higher
thermal conductivity does not mean
better thinner means better and this is
not particularly thin but it might be a
more suitable solution if there are
manufacturing tolerance differences from
the packaging plants so let's get the
the rest of the cooler out if we can you
can actually tell that this is a vapor
chamber over here it's it is connected
to pipes which is sort of interesting
but the way you can tell it's a vapor
chamber is because in the right light
you can see the circles right here and
if you cut this open those would
actually be just small copper cylinders
and those are used to to sort of keep
the gap inside of the vapor chamber you
know so that it doesn't I guess collapse
on itself but but that is indicative of
a vapor chamber typically let's let's
get this off though and just confirm
everything so I think for this we need
some small Torx screws 5 and actually
it's it's technically not TR because
it's not a security screw but close
enough this is so far much easier to
disassemble than the RT axe parts that
we looked at previously so that's at
least an improvement
maintaining the fans getting to the
thermal solution isn't too bad either as
you saw okay so that just lifts out make
sure we're careful of the cables all
right base plate cooler and then fans
the fans our first D apparently is the
brand they are DC fans of course a 0.32
apps 12 volt so that's your fan spec and
if you did want to replace one exactly
the model number sits first first do I
guess is the brand uh oh that's
interesting
so I mean doesn't tell us a whole lot
but the fans were made in November at
least of last year so fd-80 one 5h 1 2 s
is the model if you ever need to replace
one of these these are 10 millimeter
heat pipes they are flat heat pipes the
reason that companies do flat like this
as opposed to round as it does increase
the surface area so the contact area to
the fins which these are the L shaped
flat fins on the bottom to improve
increased contact surface area the
contact area to the fins is increased by
doing that and then they just solder
between the fin yes that is soldered
between the fin and the heat pipe pretty
standard stuff so here's a same sort of
vapor chamber standoffs as on the
previous Vega cards another giveaway of
vapor chamber is that tail right there
so it looks like the world's smallest
heat pipe that's just where the vapor
chamber is closed off so this is a vapor
chamber again the the biggest giveaways
is that you can see there's little
copper dents all through the whole thing
that's not really imperfections that's
just where there are cylinders inside
the support the thin and then we have
heat pipes so there's two four or five
heat pipes and only really two and a
half of those go through the relevant
area which would be the GPU itself well
actually we don't even know where they
go through they just seem to just I
guess they just terminate let's see okay
so stand corrected I don't think they
terminate it looks like these actually
do go sort of from this perspective
under the vapor chamber down here and
then connect to the fin
or the Finn stack so anyway about
two-and-a-half of those in the GPU area
which is the relevant area and the rest
is just L shaped fins for contact to the
base plate which is right here and the
orientation of the base plate would be
roughly this except flipped so there's
your cooling solution really pretty
simple stuff it's not like they they
don't have any increased surface area on
the base plate it's just a contact plate
is what it is and in fact there's not
any thermal interface between the base
plate and the cooler itself either so I
think there's some direct contact going
on here maybe we'd have to look at the
PCB again between the inductors are
actually that those are just clearance
holes for caps and things so pretty
pretty simple cooler favorite chamber
and heat pipes that's what it is and
here's the top side just cuz it looks
kind of cool will show you that so you
can see the fin stack which is clearly
got to have a lot of clearance for these
fans that Andy has switched to so that
would sock it down like this and then I
mean the question at this point is you
know where's your air going so with the
fins oriented vertically like this as
opposed to horizontally like this the
air will only have one way to escape and
that's going to be up and down and it'll
get guided by the fins you might have a
little bit coming out over here over
here just because there's no and nothing
really blocking it but once you put this
thing down there's there's a bit of
pathway to escape there at the bottom
which would go into the motherboard so
that's not the best place for the air to
escape at the top unfortunately the fins
are largely obstructed where these two
fans sort of meet fins are largely
obstructed by that radion shroud so that
that does limit the cooling capabilities
but some of the air can come out here
somewhere and viddy does the same thing
they both do the same thing for
aesthetics it's really not great for
thermals in so far as design but
aesthetics I guess you got to put the
name somewhere and that's where the card
face is the user so that's where it goes
so that covers the cooler the PCB will
talk to build Zoid see if it's worth
doing more depth on the PCB so that's it
that's the AMD Radeon seven big a card
for you today we're only allowed to talk
about the card itself in a physical form
we can't talk performance numbers just
yet so that's the only thing that's
really embarked aright now is the
performance review and for that the card
launch is on the seventh which is
Thursday this week so you could surmise
when the review would go up and that
will be with all of our performance
numbers for gaming maybe we'll do some
production this time as well and then of
course power overclock and stuff like
that so some interesting stuff in here
for you mostly the throwing pad solution
the graphite pad that's clearly a bit
unique how well it works we'll find out
we have most of it already but I can't
tell you what it is so check back for
more subscribe as always to catch that
you get a stored on cameras axis dotnet
to pick up a mod mat like the one I was
working on here they are shipping this
week we just got another round in and
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus tops out
there as well thank you for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
