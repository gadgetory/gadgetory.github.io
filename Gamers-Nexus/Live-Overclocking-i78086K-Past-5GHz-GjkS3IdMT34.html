testing audio on the secret side channel
for some of our patreon backers helped
out make sure the audio works thank you
very much for that so we are alive I
think let me know if there are any
issues I am going to send out a quick
tweet and let everyone know we're live
so while I'm doing that just let me know
if everything seems okay we've seen
seeing tweets so that's good or mentions
in chat right so Twitter we are live o
seen 8086 K so that's what we're doing
today you're going to be live
overclocking let me know audio sounds
fine they say all right cool thank you
very much so what we are going to do is
overclock and intel i7 8086 k I haven't
done a ton of work on this one I've done
enough to kind of figure out loosely
what my parameters are for overclocking
I want to see how far we can push it so
what we know for sure yes it's it's
already deleted I'll get to that in a
moment I want to let some people join
into the stream first make sure we've
got people watching and then I'll start
explaining everything the setups really
cool though so basically yeah overclock
in 8086 k we didn't want to do a full
standalone review of this processor
because it's an 8700 so if you know like
especially stock they're the same thing
8086 k 8700 k same thing stock basically
the voltage to sustain a set frequency
much like rise in 2000 is lower with
8086 k than with 8700 k but other than
that the frequency is the same stock so
it over clocks better so that's the same
with the new CPU and that will answer on
cello and with the first donation you
seem seem like you're on every stream
thank you so much for being a consistent
watcher of ours and super chat backer
the cpu we are using today is not in
fact 79 80 XE it is the 8086 k i7 cpu so
it is a special binned version of of the
8700 k
which many of you are likely familiar
with so let me let me just make sure
everyone's kind of aware of the stream
and I will tell everyone we're alive and
we're gonna start playing around with
this thing and see what it can do
alright so what we have is a swiss bios
next to me and i'm just gonna reset i
think it's already been reset to default
but let's just do that again and i'll
show you what we're working with if this
yeah so 8086 k we currently have two
sticks of course their memory in there
later in the stream I'm probably going
to change out to this memory this is
some g.skill Triton Z black which this
helped us get top 5 world records with a
Titan V and the 79 AD axes this is
really good memory we've already tested
it we know it can do 4000 megahertz so
at some point in the stream when I'm I'm
kind of stuck on the CPU settings will
likely switch the memory and just see
how much extra distance that can gain us
so I let me let me just kind of answer a
couple questions and chat as we get
rolling I see a lot of people are
rolling in right now so yeah we're
giving everyone a minute to get in
because it should be a pretty good
stream Alex 5euro says how is it going
to see if it's going pretty well thank
you for asking looking forward to seeing
how the CPU does we're gonna push for I
don't know I'm hoping we can do at least
five point three gigahertz I see some a
couple of you and chatter talking at
your overclocks one of you EK Dromi you
say you have yours at 5.2 so I wanna see
if I can beat yours today we're gonna go
for 5.3 and I'd like to do 5.4 but I
don't know that that's going to be
possible that's that's pretty hard to do
for cooling we don't have anything
really special or exotic on here so
that's gonna be probably our limiting
factor at some point I'm not gonna be
able to do 1.5 volts I don't think for
example what still letting people roll
on its it's building up fast though
we're at 840 I think watching now up
from 400 like a minute or so so a couple
messages fin dog $2 let's get this
nuclear reactor going we'll get there I
took the i9 out so it's not as new
clear it's like a baby nuclear reactor
with the 8086 k just to let you know i
guess how this the kind of power can
something we just shot a video a little
bit ago the power consumption and
thermals for the 8086 k and with one of
the higher frequency and and voltage
settings I think it was drawing 250
watts at the EPS 12-volt cables which is
a whole lot of power for what is a six
core CPU so it is quite power-hungry
couple more questions before I get
started how do you have your 8086 K
already I got an email saying I won
yesterday Intel send it to us so I don't
know I thought didn't they already sell
them though I thought you could already
get them I'm like Amazon and Newegg you
don't have to win it okay so alright
two to quick super chats and then we'll
get going we're at a thousand viewers
now I think that's good to start
overclocking so last few super chats
before we get going and through some
housekeeping stuff
Nuria Rivera $10 says let's get all the
memes out of the way did you use Google
Translate for the dryer oh really
someone remembers that seriously is
snowflake and midnight okay from the
fire yes they're fine nvidia clearly
sent out those technicians and shoutout
to bot crusher and zeta so in order the
dryer comment is related to the
washer/dryer combo we had in Taipei
we've none of us had ever used a combo
washer/dryer makes a lot of sense in the
country where we're especially a city
where there's not much space in the
apartment we couldn't read it we needed
help
actually Dennis from Linus tech tips
helped us a bit with translating that
thing so Thank You Dennis for that if I
and the cats are fine from the fire yes
actually everything's pretty much fine
except for the entire breaker panel
which was replaced tech therapy 5euro
can you overclock in 8086 4.77 megahertz
non k to 5 gigahertz is there actually
an 8086 9k I'm actually not familiar
with it Brynn Palmer 5nz says better to
get 8700 K and hope to hit 5 gigahertz
then pay the action for the 8086 K or
and get the five gigahertz guarantee so
yeah that's something I would be talking
about today is is this thing actually
worth it and I guess we can kind of
tackle that first so one more thing bill
juan carlos has 5.4 gigahertz on his at
1.4 5 volts that's a high mark to beat
but we'll go for it so alright we've got
enough people in here let's do some the
housekeeping stuff 8700 k vs 8086 k is a
great question I think it's like $420 to
the 8086 versus I don't know 332 350 for
they D 700 K that's pretty big price
difference the way I look at it is it's
the same cpu intel bending so they are
doing effectively what someone like
silicon lottery would typically do when
you buy from them if you would buy a
bend 80 700 K from Silicon Lottery it's
really not any different if you would
not do that and you're not planning on
overclocking or not playing out
overclocking and holding a high
overclock like 5g Plus for a long period
then no it's not worth it at all because
that's the whole point of the processor
but if you're doing any kind of
competitive overclocking it might be
worth it it's just you know worth is
kind of a tough word because the value
in terms of if you're benchmarking
competitively yeah I guess so
but if you're just playing games going
from 4.9 to 5.0 25.1 not a tremendous
difference in that even the 5.3 not a
tremendous difference but enough of one
where if you genuinely enjoy that type
of thing of overclocking and just
getting a higher number makes you happy
then yeah it's worth it so that's let's
I don't know it's a little wishy-washy
but in general I would say probably get
the 8700 K it's fine if you're
legitimately going to overclock the 8086
K it might be worth it but it is quite a
price jump because of that price you
start buying higher core count CPUs so
you're balancing guaranteed high
frequency versus do I want more threads
and that's going to come down to your
use case alright so let's let's get
started here let's get some baseline
stuff
a quick note we have our the limited
edition foil shirt that I'm wearing now
the orders will close today we are
almost out before even starting the
stream
if you buy any products from the Jian
store as always
while the stream is going I will shout
out your first name and where you're
from when I see the email come in will
stop periodically and go through those
and get obviously a lot of overclocking
in between but the limited edition foil
shirts with the GN anniversary logo the
ten year anniversary logo will close for
pre-orders at the end of this stream and
at that point I think that's it we're
gonna be out of stock so if you want one
you got to buy it during the stream
otherwise we're not making any more so
once they're gone they're gone let's get
this thing started all right so we
currently have an ASUS Maximus board
it's a Maximus X or 10 if you prefer and
all I'm going to do is enable XMP I am
NOT going to do anything special and I'm
saying yes to the prompt beyond that and
the reason for that is we want a
baseline so I want to know how much
we've actually improved by the end of
the stream not even gonna increase the
fan speeds it's not necessary anyway for
what we're doing but I will once we
start overclocking so all this is set to
auto right now and we'll go through some
memory and all that other stuff later
this is resetting everything okay so
let's do that doing some pre-show
testing and a lot of blue screens were
happening so hopefully I've saved the
Sol's in time so this is restarting with
just Auto and XMP and that's going to
give us our baseline for for fire strike
I think we're gonna use fire strike
today the score I would like to hit by
the end of the stream is going to be
let's go with 24,000 points in physics
so we're just gonna run fire strike
physics it'll be way faster that way get
a lot more benchmarking in there will be
a lot of blue screens during this
testing I'm going to warn you now it's
the nature of overclocking I'll do my
best to minimize that I pretest it some
voltages just to speed it up but you
know I apologize there will be police
screens we'll have plenty of Super chats
and fun things to go through though
while that stuff is happening so I will
be sure to read your questions whether
they are in chat or super chat when we
have blue screens just to have a bit of
fun while we're doing this
so let's get our baseline in I am I'll
go through the components as soon as I
get this thing running so we're just
going to do physics and let me get a
hardware info up just kind of baseline
thermals and then I'll tell you about
the config
generation the hardware configuration so
let's just pop up one of these and maybe
Core 4 so we'll have 2 cores to look at
once this is done and it should be ok
these clocks are probably correct
alright just making sure they're restore
to defaults worked properly we don't
want to loop we do want windowed so ok
first baseline benchmark here at the
8086 K what do we want to do about this
glare you got it nice ok cool so we are
not doing direct capture every time
we've tried that with overclocking the
capture card eventually loses the
benchmark system because it crashes a
lot and so that causes issues so yeah we
got a benchmark going all I'm doing
right now is just making sure the
thermals aren't insane so the reason for
that is because I've deleted the CPU
we've applied liquid metal our sponsor
for the stream is actually thermal
grizzly who provided the conductor not
liquid metal and there's a link below if
you want to pick up the liquid metal we
use from them we also use cryo not for
thermal paste in a lot of scenarios and
it's something I might apply later in
the stream if we need thermal Hedren but
we're pretty good right now in physics
is a really short test so we're only
hitting in the 40s I'm pretty okay with
that and for our physics core
here's what we got eighteen thousand
seven so I'm gonna start a notepad file
and baseline for first test eighteen
thousand seven that is our 8086 KOC
stream so what we're trying to do is get
to 24,000 points to give you an idea of
what that means there is I pull it up I
have a chart from someone so there's a
hardware bot submission I'm just gonna
read you his submission this is from
lefty 23 edges picked one that was at an
achievable level so Lefty 23 I got
25,000 for a physics score and that was
with and 8700 K but the frequency was
pretty high it was 5 point 5 gigahertz
so I don't know if we're gonna make it
but I think about did I say 25 he was 25
so we're going for 24 basically I'm
gonna shoot just under that because I
don't think I can hit 5.5 I think I can
maybe get to 24,000 points so that is
our objective today and we are going to
let's see I think we're gonna just go
ahead and yeah I'll walk you through the
components so we come on the other side
of here
and I'll show you the components we have
just so you know what we're working with
as we get started I have to crawl under
all the lights move this one I guess
Andrea's gonna go handheld on the camera
I think so
give us a second while it shakes and
gets moved around okay so everyone get a
shout out shout out to Andrew for headed
out their cameras bunch of cables
sticking out of it so here's our system
cracking X 62 this is just a standard
test cooler we like to use because we
know how it performs and we have a lot
of them so these are currently not at
matok speeds they don't need to be but
they will be in a moment so coolers
crackin X 62 and I've got it plugged
into USB so that we can actually read
the the liquid temperatures if we need
them here's probably my favorite thing
and this is really stupid but this is
just a power and reset button and it's
just connected over there so I can
actually reach it without having to
it'll it'll speed up the stream a lot
basically so just connect it in it's a
really nice benchmarking tool you just
hit power reset you can make one on your
own if you wanted to CPU is under there
obviously 8086 k for that it is deleted
I scraped 100% of the silicon adhesive
off which is a big contributor to
thermal performance almost more than
liquid metal in some instances depending
on the application and it's also got
liquid metal thermal grisly conduct and
out on it a very fine layer that's
working pretty well from thermal testing
ten atti FTW three the Titan V will be
broken out again pretty soon I have a
use for it coming up and I just put it
under a water block but for today 1080i
FTW three and then we have two sticks of
Vengeance lpx memory this is not the
best memory I have but we're gonna start
with it and then just because it's
stable that is thirty-two hundred
megahertz CL 16 and I think it's two by
eight gigabytes going with two sticks
instead of four is going to help us out
a lot
in timings later on and I'm gonna do
maybe later if I remember I swapped this
memory from G from the coarser kit to G
skill and push it up to probably I don't
know at least 3600 but I know it can do
4,000 it just depends on the eye MCM
8086 k and then the motherboard ACS ROG
Maximus X and then the Corsair a X 1600
eye power supply for the power supply
which is in single rail mode so that we
don't hit over current protection
because we might otherwise so that is
the bench system and we can we can move
back and start overclocking it now that
everyone knows what's in there big thing
though is that yes it is deleted and it
does have liquid metal on the CPU is
this where you want the light or should
I be position it and if we move the
light again just remember the fan is on
ER okay alright so that's the system let
me let me get this started I'll go
through some of the super chats that
just came in so we're just gonna go for
something basic I think on 8700 K we
know 5.0 4.9 pretty doable for at least
one of those so we have two things we
can test we can do kind of we do like
lowest voltage that is stable at a given
frequency or we can do we can do highest
highest frequency that we can just push
and who cares about voltage so they were
mostly going to be going for a higher
frequency today but there is something
to be said
just like the rise in 2000 series the
8086 K is is a it performs in a way that
you can hit a target voltage between the
8700 8086 and on the 8086 you'll be at a
lower target frequency you'll be at a
lower voltage for a given frequency on
the 8086 K which is one of the big
things that I think is not discussed and
it's something we talked about in the
video we filmed earlier today it'll go
live tomorrow in that video talks about
how using liquid metal and using
scraping off all the silicon adhesive
all that stuff it's not just about
performance
you can also use those techniques to
reduce your noise levels instead so we
were able to reduce noise levels by 10
DB a at a given frequency because we
were able to cool it better and you'll
see that in tomorrow's video so alright
first thing I'm doing I just show
everyone we have XMP on I'm not going to
change memory until we put the G scale
kit in later we're staying at 100 BC LK
for now we might be able to push this to
101 maybe 102
later 101.5 and that'll be useful if we
get stuck on a ratio we're gonna leave a
lot of this stuff Auto for now
multi-core enhancement will be
overridden so we can leave it alone this
is changing the sync all cores and we're
gonna start let's just start at 49
because for sure that will work and
that's gonna give us a 4.9 gigahertz
clock and then we'll move up from there
so establishing baseline overclock and
from here I'm going to disable SPID
support so CPU SPID support is a
protocol that is that can be used from
for communicating between the CPU and
the VRM and the Saleen it is just it's
helpful for a few reasons one of which
is over temperature and stuff like that
Digital has power control this is a
panel most people don't really pay
attention to so this is present on
basically every motherboard just asus
has one of the more complete ones on
it's names specifically so what we're
gonna do here is just increase the LLC
so load line calibration will help us
keep a stable voltage I'm sure a lot of
this is is kind of review for some of
you guys but if you don't know what it
is hopefully I can provide some insight
today so LLC load line calibration if we
put it at seven it will definitely hold
the voltage I type in 4v core but
there's a good chance that it overshoots
and over volts beyond what I specified
so if I type in 1.41 it might jump to
one point four four sometimes which can
be dangerous I'm gonna put at level six
for now I will increase if we need to
later for stability it will typically
stay about what what I specify at level
six it might dip below it so that can be
a problem later on
potentially or in a disable
spread-spectrum for overclocking this is
just a vrm noise reduction option and
then we are going to let's see we need
to get some of the power stuffs or
current limits I didn't mention that a
second ago when I changed it
CPU current limit is really important
you want this maxed out for overclocking
that's something that's easily
overlooked on a lot of motherboards and
with some CPUs if you don't max these
out and you start pushing high clocks
you might actually clock drop even
without knowing it because you're
hitting a current limit not at a
temperature thing for RAM it's not gonna
hurt it it'll be fine
so we're good there just some basics
before we get started let's back out of
this menu CPU power management menu I'm
going to max out the power limits here
just in case and all those are fine I
think we got most of the stuff I need
right now okay so next thing we're gonna
leave the cash ratio alone for now I
like to typically keep this about four
ticks slower than my CPU ratio core
ratio so if I go for 49 I'll set it to
45 typically what we're gonna leave it
alone for now and voltage core voltage
to set that to I don't know I'm only
going for 4.9 so for my blue screen
let's just see if it's stable at 1.3
that'd be pretty pretty good voltage to
be stable at and the last thing I need
to do is set the fans to max speed so
I'm just going to disable all the fan
controls which will max it to 100%
and I think we should be good to go to
get our first real run in there let me
just double check just see if I just sit
need to disable any power saving stuff
see states disabled those just in case
they should pretty much be over in
anyway
alright so 4.9 gigahertz is our first
test we're just gonna see how that does
and let me let me catch up with you guys
I see chats been rolling someone says 5
gigahertz 4.9 we'll need at least one
point three seven five needs one point
four it depends on the CPU keep that in
mind
you'll be surprised I don't know if
it'll be perfectly stable on this what
you're saying is true sometimes but this
CPU from the limited test has done so
far needs significantly lower voltage
than the 8700 K at the same clocks even
with liquid metal on both so my 8700 K
one of them we have with two one of the
8700 KS struggles and does four point
nine at about one point four and I think
it's one point four two volts or
something like that one point four five
for one point four to five point O is
one point four five plus and this thing
should be able to do that same frequency
at a much lower voltage we'll see how
much lower here but that was a really
bad 8700 we had another one that's one
point four volts for 5.0 just to give
you some baseline so one point 4 volts
5.0 is what our good 8700 K does on the
same motherboard so we're gonna go
windowed I will worry about stability at
the end we'll do one full 3d mark pass
not gonna overclock the video card today
I don't think depending on how the score
is looking anyway so let's just run this
windowed
remember our score to be in physics is
24,000 points for the physics score that
is the score to beat today we're at four
point nine you can see here I should
note this about the bus clock but
sometimes you'll see the bus clock jump
around it depends on the motherboard
like right there dip to ninety-nine
point nine that's probably a rounding
error more than anything but every now
and then you might see a board that goes
down to 99 and that will impact and your
frequency and create variance and what
you're seeing here so that can sometimes
be the
factor of that result thermals are good
we're in the 40s 50s it's pretty high
ambient temperature right now so that is
going to be a factor at some point let
me let me get some of the super chat
comments I see we have a lot of them
score right now 20,000 668 get in there
already first one so it was stable for
that while I do super chat what I'm
going to do is a quick stability test
and the reason for this
it passes yes one pass that's like a 30
second test so I'm just going to loop it
and this is going to be for thermals and
it's going to be for scene if it does
crash if we leave it alone for a while
because if it crashes then we'll need to
increase the voltage it's not that
legitimate of an overclock of it if it
crashes after 30 seconds so I'm just
gonna leave that running while we do
some super chat and some other other
chat interaction just to make sure we've
got an idea for where our baseline is so
all right questions here there are a lot
of super chats thank you very much for
sending those in we have one from yummy
Alex to Euro love your content just
showing just giving some love thank you
very much we appreciate it the two euro
will go towards some fast food at the
end of the stream bill Wanchai low two
dollars
my guest is 5.4 gigahertz at one point 4
or 5 volts I think that's what you said
yours does so if I'm correcting that
that would be a good mark for us to beat
we'll see I don't know Silicon lottery
plays a big role on this stuff
that thing's still running by the way so
it's looking ok so far will there be a
this is in normal chat a random frog
will there be a gold foil version of
this shirt this is our limited edition
anniversary turndown shirt it will not
be as available for sale anymore at the
end of the stream random frog asks if
there will be a gold version in the
future I don't know we've talked about
it we have a couple ideas if we do one
it will almost certainly not be this
design we want this one to be kind of
special so we have a couple ideas there
will there is an option for a different
color foil but I can't commit to
anything right now certainly something
we've considered though Martin
with Bardo Chadwicks
sorry 499 thank you very much say hi
Joel hi Joel and can't wait to see what
this overpriced 8700 K can do that's
sort of valid yes also are you sure it's
not a 79 80 XE quite sure we haven't
tripped a breaker yet slideway is two
for seven 24/7 five dollars can you
daily 1.4 five volts on risin 2600 X or
keep it under 1.4 - supposedly it's
written somewhere but I can't find it
can you run to AI o rads and one custom
loop - AI o rads in a custom loop i i
know super chats limiting on character
count but if I understand what you're
saying I are you asking like for example
the fractal or the ek semi-closed loops
where you can expand them because you
can't expand a closed loop if it has
like a quick disconnect on it so I hope
I'm understanding that correctly if
that's the question then yes you just
have to buy one that will work with it
and you have to make sure that the the
pump is powerful enough to push that
much liquid that's the biggest concern
some of them come with their own pump in
each block like a GPU block CD block I
think alpha cool used to do that so that
would be the the most sure way to make
sure you have the pump speed required to
do what you're asking about I hope I
understand that question
as for risin 2600 acts overclocking I
haven't worked with the 2600 acts since
we reviewed it keep that in mind I would
always advise checking out review to see
what we got there for overclocking and
what voltage we said that because
whatever we put there is what we were
comfortable with for 24/7 for the most
part and I can't remember it because we
write a lot of content but that would be
my recommendation as for voltage though
Rison does have different voltage
requirements than Intel with rise in
2000 series I like to keep it like 1.4
and under you can go over 1.4 it's
normally fine just be really careful of
the SOC voltage that's the one that
kills IMC's or this was he tactically on
I am the horizon chips that's the
dangerous voltage core voltage it's nice
to keep it around 1.4 plus or minus may
be like point I don't know 0-2 or
something
that so okay next question is from Alex
I'm gonna limit this to maybe two more
before I move on to the benchmarking
Alex to euros what's a good firestrike
score for personal rigs that is a great
question it depends on your part so let
me like pull up a quick chart that we
have and just get a good answer for you
so what's our what do we call like a
good price for the average personal
machine maybe like a thousand to fifteen
hundred bucks would be kind of in the
mid mid to high class of machine so let
me just pull up our compiled GPU
benchmarks sheet and see what our scores
are there for synthetics synthetic GP
benchmarks okay so to answer your
question correctly I'm just gonna check
our actual data so if anyone wants to
play along at home while I'm doing this
fire strike benchmarking feel free to
let me give you some some sort of
ballpark numbers we had a 980 TI and
7700 k with a total score of fourteen
thousand eight sixty five and a physics
score of fourteen thousand six fifty two
so with our seventy seven hundred K I
think at four point five gigahertz it
seems like it does between thirteen
thousand nine hundred and fourteen
thousand six hundred depending on the
other components like the memory and the
clocks and all that stuff but that's
kind of the range of the 7700 K for
physics and with this machine we were
already out twenty thousand points for
physics course that gives you a good
baseline four point five on a seventy
seven hundred K it's got the two core
differential as well that's a big player
and fire strike a fire strike scale is
pretty damn well up to at least 18 cores
it like 16 a bit better so hopefully
that gives you a bit of an answer if you
want another card let's pick a lower end
one 1050 T I was at 69 69 points for
total score and same physics score cuz
the same CPU so you know 7000 points for
1050 Ti and then we have a 1080 TI FTW 3
the card that's in here total score 28
20800 graphics score of about 30,000
hopefully that answers your question
pretty well all right let's uh I'll get
back to the Super chat to see there a
lot of them thank you very much and I'm
also going to send a quick tweet and
just say
don't miss our 8086 k livestream and i'm
gonna let everyone know we're pushing
past 5 gigahertz now okay so we are
going to start pushing that and I'll
read through all the store purchases in
a moment as well once we get the next
probably the least rain there's
something it's okay this has been stable
backs temperature was 61 on one of these
cores it's definitely pushing it I mean
it's like it's fine there's plenty of
overhead but I'd like it to be lower and
part of that is because room ambience
high with the stream machine and the
benchmark machine going at the same time
so that's going to increase their
temperatures by like 4 degrees on the
CPU so I'm doing now restart back into
BIOS and we're just gonna we were at 5
gigahertz 1.3 stable I think which is a
really low voltage for that frequency
and that's because this is a bin chip so
as a reminder our worst eighty-seven
hardcase stopped here and it also
required a voltage where it says 1.3 now
of about I don't remember one point
forty I think something like that is
pretty rough we have another does 1.4 at
50 so what I want to see more than just
how high can we push it is how high can
we push it while keeping the voltage low
that's part of my goal today so we're
gonna leave this at 1.3 if I were just
trying to get a high frequency what I do
is set that to one point four or five
right now and just type in 54 for the
ratio and see if it's stable but I don't
want to do that I want to see what's the
lowest voltage we can sustain at a given
frequency as well so let's just leave it
here this is probably going to be too
aggressive and it might blue screen but
I think this whole this will give us a
good idea of the voltage requirement for
an overclock on this thing someone's
saying he's probably on the latest BIOS
yes I am on the latest BIOS for this
motherboard let's see
just reading some of the chat comments
prime95 someone asked so eat prime95
especially with a couple things about
prime95 with the AV X versions anything
after 26.6 it's a really good benchmark
it's awfully aggressive and it will
crash on probably the voltage and
frequencies that I've been setting
because it's a lot more aggressive on
the CPU and it's a V X so it's way
hotter
so prime95 is a fantastic benchmark it's
really good for stability for 24/7
because you're pretty much guaranteed it
will fail if it's going to ever in
prime95 with 8 K F of T's smaller F of
T's are hotter so if you do eight custom
run with small FFT is in place that will
be about the hottest you can do but I'm
I don't care about 24/7 I care about a
high score so stability doesn't matter
to me as long as it's stable and fire
strikes so we are not going to be using
prime95 today although it is a very good
utility windowed mode disable all these
and let's get hardware info up just just
for some monitoring if you if you want
to play along at home and kind of get
some software goin yourself or maybe
this inspires you to do some
overclocking later I can highly
recommend the hardware info 64 it's
probably my favorite monitoring
application and it is free so that's
great - it just has I mean this is just
to give you an idea this is hardware
info 64 and this is all the stuff that
it tells you and most of it's pretty
damn accurate actually so there is a lot
of information in here this this page
right here is particularly actually now
on one where is it this one this is a
really useful page if you ever like see
your clock dropping and you're like I
don't know what's going on my
temperatures are fine but it it's
dropping from 5.0 to 4.4 whatever check
out this section and if it says like yes
and any of these columns then go find
that toggle if it there's one and
disable it so a toggle for power would
be a great example if there's a power
limit turn it off we did that earlier so
we're not gonna hit that thermal limit
so you just got to get a better cooler
but we're deal it and throw some
conducting out on there something like
that they are a sponsor for the stream
today their link is in the in the
description below along with our store
link but anyway physics score twenty
nine 60s we're about a hundred points
higher that's basically within variants
for fire strike but the important thing
here is for one Ron were stable at 1.30
pretty damn good and 5.0 gigahertz so
that's pretty crazy let me let this run
for maybe about two minutes or so just
to kind of see if it's real if I were to
run prime it'd probably crash but you
know whatever we're doing fire strike
today so okay so we're just gonna keep
an eye on this see if it crashes let me
get through some of these it's a couple
super chats that I need to go through
did I get yes I got that one I got
Alex's question bill on cello five
dollars I wish I had an eighty eighty
six K my guess is five point four
gigahertz for yours I hope so too
nasty with a knife five Canadian thank
you very much we've seen your name
around here a lot
I appreciate your continued support nasi
says I purchased a sign mod mat and a
limited edition shirt yesterday thank
you very much for doing that anyone else
who wants to grab one it's in the store
and the link in the description below
are you going to store documents access
net our mod mats are a highly durable
four foot by two foot modding surface
and freedom units if you measure that
way and it comes with wiring diagrams
that we use pretty regularly actually
and it's it's resistant to things like
water it's fine with thermal phase and
finally liquid about all that stuff so I
actually love the product we did a great
job with it
if I say so myself disturb medic 167
five dollars thank you for reminding me
to order a an Ellie for the anniversary
shirt today or yesterday hope in your
8086 K does as well as mine I hope so
too
Michael Kelly five dollars love your
channel great stuff thank you very much
Michael
Jack reitman five dollars if we see our
electricity and the stream suddenly goes
out is it safe to assume at OGN for a
bit please don't burn down your house
we'll try not to this time that was the
fault of the electricians thank you very
much and we weren't even Ronnie Donnie
benchmark
in fact this is something I should have
pointed out the load on the panel at
that time was super low because that was
actually right when we left for Taipei
so I think I don't know we had some idle
computers for remote access or something
and like a router to make a printer but
there was a lot of load on it so that
install I think by the electricians
Augustus 5a I don't know what that what
that means on YouTube I don't know if
that's Australian or what
five dollars eh how do you think
overclocked and will be affected if the
flat earthers are proved correct I'm not
going to count on that ad on the Shum
Shuman senior five dollars here's a
donation to a vibration proof table or
cat treats your choice probably cat
treats but we're talking about a better
table for the for the next rendition of
the video said I'll talk about that more
soon
it's it's really I mean all this will
stay the same but we have a move coming
up so this is still stable let me just
kind of see what this thinks okay so
hardware info which tends to be fairly
accurate via the motherboard readout
there's two sections there's a CPU
readout you can see the headers up here
and there's a motherboard readout via
this readout for the motherboard vcore
where'd it go 1.3 pretty damn close
that's what the hell LC 6 load line
calibration 6 we did a LLC 7 it might
spike up a bit and do maybe 1.31 instead
or something like that so I was pretty
good measuring out the back foot stock
it would be the most accurate but I it's
a huge pain to set that up so we're not
going to do that today
and it's not really stream friendly so
we're pretty stable here again probably
wouldn't be stable for almost literally
any other benchmark but for firestrike
or I shouldn't say for any other
benchmark but for games it is stable so
that's fine for me we're at like 2900
earlier 4 at 5 gigahertz 1.3 volts I
think so let's just kind of knew that
there's restart see what else we can get
okay so we've got a $5 donation from RN
x-bike thank you very much no message
with that slide weighs twenty four seven
five dollars for the AI oh I have an H
one ten and an H 55 line round and I was
thinking about combining them on the
same loop on the same pump what does a
so see need to be under depends
Rison one if I remember correctly it was
advisable to stick around like 1.2 or
something like that or under and rise
into I can't remember what our final
decision was on that because we had
conflicting reports from Andy and from
over from exo Sears attendant Russ to
exercise their job is killing stuff
mostly components so 1.3 and under is
definitely safer do not do anything like
1.4 try and stay away from 1.3 plus so
that would be my rough guideline for
rise on series as for your loops if you
are handy and you can you know chop the
tubes off and run a new tube between
them I'm sure I guess you could do that
yeah one of them with a for the pump
might be a little weak probably stick
with h1 I don't know I don't remember
it's a he's a tech Gen 5 or what for 110
actually 110 is um might be cooling
either way you can cut the tubes off and
run your own tube and that would achieve
what you're going for I think I just
don't know if it'll be enough power from
the pump Brenden 5 euro can I get a
happy birthday shout out it's you Z
happy birthday fizzy thank you for the 5
bucks and I hope you have a good
birthday whether it was today in your
time zone or 2 or yesterday and last one
I'm gonna read before we get back Keeks
graphics to Canadian hey man thoughts on
the FX 83-70 I have one in one of my
machines in my main machine it is in
there because it's one of the worst
processors we have it's under volted and
under clocks because the motherboard is
plugged into has serious BRM thermal
issues like 100 C plus when it's barely
doing anything so not my favorite
processor I don't know it was kind of
okay when it came out of the
times at the price depending on the
price sometimes it was fine Rison has
blowing that thing away though if you if
you want to stay with AMD it's like
miles ahead of it
Intel outperformed it quite regularly
especially an IPC especially in
single-thread so the 83-70 was no case
stopgap solution for Andy but it was not
a good processor sort of for it has not
aged while I guess it was fine as a
processor I mean I'm using it daily for
years now and it's done ok but you know
there are better processors I guess is
what I'm getting at but it was fine it
just wasn't something I would call good
51 so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna keep
pushing we're gonna stay at 51 1.3 or
we're gonna move to 51 1.3 we're at 50
1.3 I'm just gonna keep doing this until
it crashes at which point I'll increase
the voltage then we'll know our Volt
frequency baseline someone says so who
is this two things
Nathan $5 thank you surprised that you
didn't lose any electronics in the
building when the panel failed where you
just lucky or was there a reason for
that I don't know I mean I hope we
haven't lost any electronics I haven't
tested every single thing but that was
certainly one why thoughts as well we
have anything important is behind a UPS
uninterruptible power supply so we have
a cyber power not not sired power PC but
cyber power and APC UPS is on like
everything so I would imagine and line
conditioners and things like that so I
would imagine if anything were to die it
would be one of those and then hopefully
it would protect the the actual
components so I don't know I haven't
seen anything yet it's possible
something died we have a lot of stuff I
don't always turn all of it on so yeah
I'm not sure not loop in window mode
physics test launch hardware info we're
at 5.1 on an 8080 6k for anyone
wondering at only one point three volts
right now let's see if it crashes that's
the real kind of the big thing here a
lot of people I think forget about is
that it's not just how high does it
clock it's how low can you get the
voltage for a given clock because that
will reduce your power consumption
sniff account Lee and your heat
significantly you actually I have a
table that we'll be publishing in
tomorrow's video that talks about all
that so it's a very you should
definitely tune in for that video
tomorrow subscribe if you are not
subscribed and you're new here because
that will help give you some some great
information on voltage frequency and
thermals and power and noise actually
got all of them of course you're still
doing okay right now it's a short test
and it is indeed 5.1 gigahertz see what
our score is four five point one at one
point three twenty one thousand one
thirty three so score to beat is twenty
four thousand if you recall so that is
the score we are going forward twenty
four thousand today and so far we are at
twenty one
one thirty three at five point one
gigahertz one point three volts pretty
damn good
and also LLC is still sixth right now
okay so let me uh let's push up a bit
more actually I'll go through the BIOS
settings again for anyone who's just
tuned in I'll try and make it quick if
you've already been here just if anyone
wants to overclock and you need some
ideas of what the heck all those things
do and BIOS I'm not the best overclock
or someone like build Zoid is great for
that at actually hardcore overclocking
their Bower is both of them are experts
but I've picked up a lot from them so
hopefully I can give you some great
starting points for your own overclocks
so let's go through some of the settings
I'll go quickly
first of all fans are maxed out so
that's important today and that puts our
cooler at about 51 decibels of you're
curious and then our I've only enabled
XMP I haven't changed any of the memory
so just CL 16 right now we can improve
that later with different memory 100 B
CLK this setting base clock affects a
lot of things affects basically
everything so if you increase this to
101 it would also increase the effective
DRAM frequency so what I want you to do
is look up here 3200 right now is what
it says we go to 101 you'll see 32 32 I
know this is review for a lot of you
guys if you
our familiar with it will get passed in
a second so you can see it affects
pretty much everything and for that
reason I do like to try and avoid
adjusting VCL can to the last second
because I normally don't want to
introduce all the variables of memory
and cache ratios and stuff
multi-core enhancements are relevant
we're overriding it today SPID
is a interconnect of our protocol I
suppose between the vrm and the CPU that
it's used as a communication hub and I
think it does a few other things I'm not
familiar with that's the main one so
like over-temperature would be an
example or overcurrent protection on the
vrm cores you go per core if you have
some stronger ones but I'm going for all
core just because I prefer that it's
easier you could Bend individual cores
if you really wanted to go crazy
DRAM we're ignoring all this stuff right
now and then this is a great menu I
already showed it earlier Digital has
power control it's on basically every
motherboard ACS has a special name for
it
but any motherboard look for your power
settings doesn't matter which board it
is hopefully they have some you want to
max out your current limits and set load
line calibration I would recommend
generally speaking setting this to the
not max settings so like gigabyte I
think calls them like turbo extreme
stuff like that set it to the second
highest one and check what the voltage
readouts are in hardware info you should
check back in the socket but this is
easier and good enough so going to the
extreme settings and sometimes it will
cause an over-voltage scenario rather
than an under voltage scenario which is
less safe in the former and the rest of
this is all pretty standard and later on
I can talk about it more if we need to
so let's go to 52 at 1.3 so you would
still say well I'm expecting a crash at
some point here because we're getting
pretty aggressive let me just check some
of the streaming information or chat and
all that stuff
YouTube okay alright 23:21 viewers thank
you very much for tuning in I just saw a
cow might pop up in chat John says hey
Steve did you Dan it got pushed off did
you just buy this retailer was at a
special sample there's the blue screen I
don't know if it was special it was a
sample sent to us by Intel I would
imagine it's not I don't know I don't
think it's special but it's for my Intel
to answer the question basically we said
you know I don't particularly want to
review this one I'm very interested in
the processor anyway so what if we do an
overclocking live stream because I think
that'd be fun and I want to see how
hayek locks but from a review standpoint
it's the same architectures Coffee Lake
it's pretty similar to native 700k it
just clocks a lot higher so overclocking
live stream made the most sense to me so
we just had our first blue screen of the
night
hopefully not of many but we'll see and
that was at 52 for the ratio so our
ratio of 52 522 gigahertz at 100 which
you know let's kind of not let it get
away from us how high of a volt
frequency that is 5.2 is it great for
you can see that to be at for this kind
of architecture so we're gonna go to
1.35 see if that's enough for 5.2 it's a
point zero five increase in our voltage
okay let me get through I'm just
scrolling out to find the last question
I did you know what we should do is some
of these store shoutouts so anyone who
grabs something from the Gion store
today while we're streaming oh my god
that's
how do I we've got a good amount of
orders take me a minute to get through
them thank you very much as I was saying
almost scared too now because I don't
know how I don't they
but this limited-edition shirt we're
closing sales at the end of the stream
we've basically sold out of our stock
for sure we're going to but we'll have
enough to get through the stream
probably so we'll close sales at the end
of the stream if it's out then it'll be
great out you won't be able to buy it so
it's not like you'll be able to buy one
that's not there
but if you pick it up or anything else
in the store mod mats whatever we have
like the mod mats a great tool for
building computers if you pick that
stuff up during the stream I'll shout
out your name first name and where
you're from and what you bought so we'll
get through those in a moment there's
quite a lot of them thank you very much
fire strike is what we want here and let
me just get this looping hopefully
because we're at one point three five
and five point two that's like I said
before that's pretty damn aggressive and
I repeat myself a lot in streams it's
because I know people come and go but
you know just just for perspective again
I've said this already but our best
eighty seven heart ko is doing 5.0 and
we're already two hundred Hertz beyond
that at a lower voltage or 87 heart k
5.0 at one point four volts on the same
motherboard with the same settings and
there's this two hundred megahertz
beyond it and as point zero 5 volts
below it so pretty damn good alright see
how let's see if this blue screens are
not and if it does not then I will let
it run stability test while I by which I
mean just looping this not prime and
then I'll get through some of the orders
that came in thank you very much for the
pickups so okay there it is that's it
that's her run it was stable for 30
seconds which is all we need right now
but not quite good enough 21-7 come on
Windows 10 all right
okay as our score actually going up 21-7
73 I would say that is in fact an
increase 5.2 gigahertz 1.3 5 volts ll c6
and I'm gonna make a note for myself 5.2
gigahertz 1.3 volts
let's just put it over here actually
it's called TNF did not finish okay so
there's our notes let's get this running
for a bit see if it survives for more
than 30 seconds okay so I've got a few
things to read through for those of you
who picked up shirts and things like
that
one question inch I just saw scrolling
by so we've got sergeant Zeta one of the
mods in chat he Zeta thanks for joining
Zita has a twitch stream he does
sometimes you should check him out
Zeta feel free to link your own stream
and chat if you want he's he does some
streaming as part of our patreon
community is one of our mods Strazza
bytes also in chat I believe Strazza
byte has a YouTube channel of their own
you can check that out as well just
click on search their name Strazza byte
for that and thank you both of you for
being here so okay this thing's running
see if it's stable or not
I 1.35 is kind of pushing it so let me
read through some of these orders mark
Andre from Canada picked up a limited
edition foil tear down shirt and the GN
blue print shirt large I think you might
have gotten the last one of those or
very close to it we're almost out of
those blue print shirts again it's our
only non black shirt I think and I was
really happy to add it and I'm glad to
see people like it we're gonna order
more as soon as the streams that were
probably got one from Roger from Florida
that's in America sort of got a limited
edition foil shirt at and that's that's
what he picked up thank you very much
Roger this thing's still surviving and
what's our temperature right now it's
5200 frequency you're doing fine
thermals are in the upper 50s kind of
60s sometimes
so we're actually okay right now on
those Gian store okay let me read a
couple get through some more of these
Daniel from California purchased a
limited-edition foil shirt Thank You
Daniel we sincerely appreciate it this
is a fun product I'm hoping we can do
some more limited edition stuff in the
future I'm not positive what it's gonna
be yet have some ideas I have some ideas
for non shirts as well you'll see more
of those soon Raphael from Austria
purchased a limited-edition shirt Thank
You Raphael Alexander this is still
stable it looks like stable as far as
fire strike physics goes not the most
abusive test Alexander from
Massachusetts picked up a foil shirt as
well thank you Alexander got a couple
more gift quite a few particular through
Chris from where is this a UK from the
UK got a foil shirt thank you very much
Chris for your support and Jacob from
Illinois got a foil shirt as well Kevin
from New York same thing foil shirt it's
a popular item today
Adrienne from Switzerland got a two
limited edition shirts and I'm gonna
probably pause after this one so that we
can get back to the content I really
appreciate all the support I'm gonna try
and you know mix the the appreciative
shout outs and the actual content so no
one gets too bored Connor from Florida
purchased a foil shirt and we do like
one more because some work came in
Christopher Lara Christopher stop there
from Washington picked up a shirt as
well and let me do one last one for now
and Tyler from Virginia picked up a
limited shirt I was just in Virginia the
other day actually
okay so drive it through so what we have
here is in the 50s still we're doing
actually pretty damn well for next 60 to
stable 5.2 1.3 volts in fire strike yeah
to show a point let me let me just kind
of illustrate why this is not a good way
to see if your overclock is stable in
real life so to speak because if we were
to run like anything else I'm fairly
positive this will crash or drop cores
oh yeah big time
so let me just illustrate to you why
fire strike is not a good stability test
you know fire strike for purposes of
what we're doing we're trying to get a
high fire strike score so the only thing
that needs to be stable in this fire
strike realistically though we've
already dropped threats here so we've
dropped one two three four five of our
threads with prime95 which is pretty
similar to blender so I'll illustrate
that here as well with blender if we get
a render going here
I'm I don't know we might drop threads
we might blue screen or it might be
stable blenders not as abusive s-prime
but it's pretty damn close crime is a
great synthesizer for for like blender
it's it's a VX it's abusive
it's a worst case scenario but blender
is more realistic so let's just kind of
it's it's currently collecting
everything and it's gonna start
rendering in a moment and we'll see if
blender is any easier on it then prime
but probably won't be too happy yeah
someone asked about will be overclocked
the gpo as well the answer is no sadly
probably probably won't tonight MOG bish
100 n okay is that Norwegian kroner
thank you very much mark - we sincerely
appreciate your support I hope you write
down your settings of your highest
stable OC for the rest of us I will
there will be a follow-up article at
least there might be a follow-up video
it's looking pretty good actually
typically blender fails within 10
minutes I'm not gonna give it that long
to fail today just because it's a stream
but typically it fails within 10 minutes
of its going to so that's a good
stability check but yeah I'll write down
the OSI settings once we're all done and
publish them on the website gamers Nexus
dotnet if you want a quick reference and
we'll probably do a follow-up video as
well so you can check it on the channel
if you want a short-form version and
this also will be archives for later
reference
and let's see bill one cello $5 wow that
seems like a really good chip yeah it
seems pretty good so far but again
remember we're crashing in prime it's
just it's surviving and firestrike we'll
see if it survives blender ultra vlogger
two bucks you're the best thank you very
much ultra vlogger that sounds like you
are the ultra East ondrea's five dollars
can you start a weekly GoFundMe to
upgrade people from older AMD and Intel
I'm a disabled vet and can't afford it
and see if AMD would pitch in I don't
know if we'd get away with weekly so
typically we don't really do giveaways
but there is something that I'm going to
be contributing a mod bat to to like on
the YouTube channel as a rule I don't I
know what you're saying is different
like I I actually keep like the idea
just to you know separate that first I
like that idea
but just general rule we don't often do
giveaways and the reason is because I
really like having you all here as like
genuine people who like the content and
not people who are just flooding in to
try and get something for free and
dilute everything so I really support
all of you being here without you know
actually needing free stuff all the time
but as a break to my rule I am providing
a an autographed mod not one of the
signed mod mats to the what did they
call it wholesome giveaway or something
cooler master and clone master Corsair
ton of vendors all the vendors got
together on that PC master-race
subreddit and started a giveaway so
we're gonna provide a mod map for the
giveaway maybe two of them I don't know
what the rules are honestly I just told
them I'd give them one I'm sure it's on
the PC I'm our subreddit though if you
want to join in and try and win whatever
they're giving away so that's the that's
the exception microvolt we're not really
gonna announce it on the channel or
anything this is kind of a quick side
mention been to barks just got here how
are these a look in verse 8700 great
question this still seems stable by the
way five point two one point three five
or something like that what am i out
right now yeah that's right five point
two one point three five still stable so
that gives you a pretty good starting
point to your question as for the rest
of it again recapping but eighty seven
hard case we have one that does
5.0 at 1.4 we have one that is 4.9 at
1.4 to roughly give or take like point
zero three I guess mostly give 23 not
take so that's our 87 our case this is
an 87 hundred K but it's been bend or
pre-selected is the more appropriate
term and it's five point two one point
three five right now and it seems stable
I'm gonna give blender it's been going
for four minutes now I'm gonna give it
maybe another three and see if it
crashes in that time and that'll give it
that'll let us know how genuine this
overclock is versus is it just a
benchmark clock Adam okay five dollars
tell Andrew he is a great camera man and
amazing at 3d renders he says nice thank
you
Adams one of our patreon guys to end
another reviewer I think in and his
check reviewer Terry says our $5 just to
thank you help you with the fire damage
yeah thanks would be nice if the
electricians would do that Sean down $2
let's see that five point five yeah I
don't think so we'll try for five point
five gigahertz Phoenix 1861 $4.99
planning to update the mod Matt as new
architectures come you know I don't know
I suppose it's an option we we have a
medium mod Matt that I've mentioned in
the past briefly mostly the patreon
backers we have one it's getting sampled
right now so we're making an O stage of
making samples manufacturing is a really
long process even for like non
electronic so yeah we're getting samples
made for a medium version it's pretty
cool it's just I'm getting a couple made
to make sure we have the quality that I
want so it'll eventually be out though
and that has some cool stuff on it
that's different from the big one but if
you want a big like table covering size
and this is what we think the the best
mod matte on the market so this has been
running for five and a half minutes
it hasn't dropped threads let me just
check the temperatures while we're at it
because this is the longest burnin we've
done so far so temperatures are getting
up there our peak was 75 sometimes those
are just the spurious jumps so let me
move this over to the left here so a lot
of people like to look at the maximum
column when they're talking about
temperatures
in reality you shouldn't do this what
you should do is log the temperature
over time allow for enough time for
steady-state to be achieved
normally half an hour is pretty damn
safe and the max can be a spurious jump
so it can just be a spike it might have
hit reported 75 for a mil asur well yeah
I guess a thousand milliseconds for like
a second it might have reported that but
in reality we're in the sixties and this
can often be from when you're just
starting the render or the application
collecting all that data so
realistically we're in the sixty is 270
it's getting warm but we're actually
doing really damn well and that's
because the voltage is only one point
three five right now so another two
minutes on this see if it if it dies if
it doesn't we'll push up to I guess five
point three gigahertz
Reverend arrow $2 I don't need giveaways
in fact here take my money thank you I
guess I guess we'd I guess we do take
aways and I guess for robbers there are
a lot of store purchases I'm going to
read as many as I can in between
overclocks I'll probably push a lot of
them to the very end of the stream but
I'll do my best here so for shout outs
while this thing's running the last few
minutes of its stability TAS and I go
through those David from Kentucky picks
up a limited edition foil shirt thank
you very much David oh by the way for
all of you ordering the foil shirts we
are they are pre folded they're in a
nice bag and everything so presentation
is good it will also have a card in
there with some notes on washing it's a
delicate item I've actually washed this
one a lot and dried it a lot as
benchmarking based Kent can't get away
from benchmarking how many charts yet
probably should but it survived really
damn well as you can see so it's been
through the wash lot some of you were
asking about foil foil is inherently a
delicate item but we are including a
very clear card just some notes so you
can make sure it lasts a long time so
just to address that question if anyone
had it this one survived quite a quite a
bit of washing and I have notes on the
website as well with how you should take
care of it because it yeah delicate item
so held up extremely well though next
one is from Hollis from California
picked up a limited edition shirt thank
you very much Hollis
Charles from California okay a lot of
California people today limited-edition
shirt Thank You Charles
thank you James from North Carolina
actually we've been up for pizza before
who gave who picked up a limited-edition
shirt as well thank you James good to
see you around Gabriel from New York
limited-edition shirt it's very popular
item Caleb from North Carolina as well
also limited-edition shirt let's see
it's still stable really that's cool all
right
eight minutes forty seconds all right
I'm gonna read this last one that will
move back to overclocking Eric from is
that Ontario Eric from Ontario Canada
picked up a limited edition shirt as
well thank you Eric okay get back to the
stream so stream time we are currently
stable at 5.30 our score and fire strike
is currently 21,000 773 and so I say
five point three I meant five point two
and we have one point three five volts
so five point two 1.35 really damn good
chips so far 21,000 my score to beat and
fire strike is 24,000 I don't know if
we're gonna reach it but we're gonna try
pretty damn hard we've got got a long
way to go right now
so we're almost at 22,000 we need
another 2,000 points which is going to
get exponentially harder as we go GPU is
not gonna help out there so even
switching to a Titan B is gonna be
irrelevant because we're only doing
physics testing right now but I do want
to do a trip ltte to stream if actually
I'm curious how many of you have seen or
saw our repel TT stream or saw like the
aftermath of it with our follow up
anything like that if you know what
repel TT is just type hashtag repel DT
and chat
just so I can get a gauge of how many of
you know what it is we're currently at
26 messages a minute so that'll be my
benchmark hashtag repel TT if you know
what that was because we want to do a
second one and I need to convince Linus
to challenge us and you know I don't
want to say scared but I think he's
scared I think I think yeah that's a lot
of Revell Fifi I think he is a
frightened especially of this response
under seal I see him lioness in a few
days actually so I'll probably late on
throw down the lay down the gauntlet
gently there for him to pick up and
challenge us back I don't wanna be I
don't throw it might scare him but uh
okay so we've gone up to Hawaii 45
messages per minute it's definitely more
than that but I think it's like
averaging over a longer period that's a
lot of repel teeth he's just gonna sit
here and take it in for a second so I
would be c- on on Saturday actually for
his LT axe thing is line it is LT t Expo
if you're near Vancouver
I think that's yeah it's in Vancouver
you know stop by I'll be in there come
say hi
brings on that if you want me to sign it
or whatever no cup of you wanted mob map
sign that's a lot of repel TV is repel T
t-shirt when you know let's get them to
respond what do you see 100 that's a lot
of messages a minute
149 messages a minute from 24 so a lot
of you have seen repel DD I take it
thank you very much that was a that was
probably the most fun I've ever had on
the stream we'll do that again soon that
was a sunny 980 accion a Titan V and rip
rip vents Lucy doe I don't think so
Vince Lucy doe is Kaden Penn if you
don't know who he is
when when you're looking at fire strike
scores if you ever like you know I I
think I can get the top hundred and you
want to compete and you look at the
scores and you see kingpin at number one
what you're really shooting for for top
100 is actually top 101 because he
doesn't count because it's impossible to
beat up he made the Robo clocker that we
saw a copy tax and it's it's like the
most in the same overclocking setup I've
ever seen he's claimed for at least
world records with it now so it's very
impressive
his work is extremely impressive its
world it's the best in the world for
some of these tests and sadly we can't
count him as a as a competitor because
it's
impossible to be done so now there will
not be a rape Vince lucida but I have
asked EVGA actually if they would be
interested in flying out at some point
and doing a live stream overclocking
with us so I don't know if that'll
happen it'd be really cool though
I don't tweet at like at and what is his
Twitter name let me see what his Twitter
name is Twitter EVGA Jacob F if you want
to see like kingpin come out here and
you want to show EVGA that you're
interested in it tweet at EVGA
underscore Jacob F on Twitter there's a
blue screen and he will just tell him
like I don't know fly kingpin the GN
there's something like that overclocked
stream all right so this is crashed
clearly so I tried five point three it's
the highest we tried at one point three
five volts that's really really
aggressive volt frequency aggressively
low on the voltage and I graphs of
lehigh on the frequency so not surprised
let's see if we can do five point three
at all let's go up a bit I'm just going
to go up by point zero five once again
one point three five to one point four
let's do that all right
okay so I've got a couple more of these
to read through super chats wishbone $5
is it possible to cover the inn when we
interrupt this killer jellyfish I need a
bigger Mod net four feet by two feet you
need a bigger one I think like we'd sell
like ten of them if they were any bigger
how much bigger does it need to be I
mean it like are we talking like wall
size or like like car sunscreen size
this boot at this time okay so anyway
wishbone five dollars was saying is it
possible to cover shoot I just scrolled
past it it's possible to cover an entire
motherboard with thermal Grizzlies
non-conductive pays for better
out-of-the-box thermals and liquid met
on the CB GPU it's a good question you
would need you need something to conduct
like anything out of it cuz just
covering it and paste like first of all
you don't need to cover the entire
motherboard I'm sure you know this
obviously it's probably a joke question
but hypothetically covering the whole
motherboard doesn't gain you a lot in
most instances in almost all instances
as a motherboard is like fiberglass and
copper basically that's what it's made
out of and it's a lot of layers of it so
it's a natural heatsink and this is why
if you have an SSD like an MDOT - SSD
one of the best ways to heatsink it if
it's dual sided is to socket it and put
a thermal pad between the motherboard
and the module is on the underside and
it obviously the controllers ideal the
sink and not the modules but whatever
and that'll sink it into the board which
is a natural heatsink but the answer to
your questions basically now because
you're at you're gonna end up blocking
more air than you will be dissipating
through conduction in terms of heat okay
so let's run this let's get hardware
info up
and that's always it's an interesting
challenge where you put heatsinks on
stuff it'll help but if it's not like a
proper heatsink and it's just
obstructing area it'll actually be worse
even if it is thermally conductive more
than areas but airflow hitting something
is always the best to actually run VRMs
without vrm heat sinks in a lot of cases
just by blasting them with air so a 5.3
we're trying 1.4 we'll see if it lives
are you still planning on reviewing the
icy graphite pads you know I got an
email about this recently I need to
reply to as well and the answer is I
hope to but we're slammed right now so
I'm trying there's a lot of travel right
now so doing my best to get to
everything and I still need to do
thermal pads on GPUs and stuff like that
we're pretty behind but I'm working on
it hashtag I saw Linus crying from
Rafael TT I guess okay so is it running
oh yeah I ran cool
you read one of these crewmen NZ $5.00
I'm going for an SFF build so temps and
therefore a voltage are important will
you be able to do an 8700 cavers 8086 K
measuring at the same gigahertz that's a
good we could probably do that I think
so the thing is again it's voltage like
it like you said so same frequency same
voltage they're gonna be roughly the
same the throne pace doesn't really
different as far as I'm aware the IHS
isn't different the silicon adhesive
isn't different especially if you're
deleting them so Tim's down to voltage
and what we've done so far actually
tomorrow's video will have some given
frequency benchmarks just with AD 6k
same idea though given frequency
benchmarks versus different voltages so
I think I did like what was it one point
for one point four five one point three
five volts so I did all those you'll see
it tomorrow's video and that should give
you a baseline for thermal differences
between them same idea with 8700 K it's
just it's one CP instead of two so this
survived 21,000 ninety-two for the
physics score and that is
I'm gay just got a text from Jacob from
EVGA he said lol what happened Jacob
will turn on my stream okay
I'll answer his question in a few
minutes give them time to join uh uh
because people tweet it out um I think
good job guys
twenty-one 992 is our physics cord Jacob
if you're joining in I'll answer your
question via text in a in a moment just
give him some time to join him
so 21 9 9 - it's really not going up
that fast if I want to hit 24,000 I have
to do a lot more than just a CPU I think
this is a really good CPU though LLC 6
ok so let's once again just do a
stability test so loop run Jacob if
you've tuned in as he answered I missed
the rip Ltd what happened it was it was
probably my favorite stream we ever did
that's what happened
that's what repelled teeth he was and I
was asking everyone to spam it in chat
so I knew how many people had watched it
and we really wanted to do Ltd -
basically the gist of it was this it was
a friendly competition with - that
apparently only one of us was competing
in even though he knew about it in
advance and uh - his team knocked out
one of our top ten scores on fire strike
and I was like no that's that's not okay
and he did was a Titan V and a sorry 980
XE so I pulled our resources mostly
build Zoid and put everything under
liquid Thank You ek for that and we beat
his score by quite a bit I think it
brought us up to number four at one
point so that was what repelled DT was
and Jacob if you've tuned in now I still
wanted to tweet at you about flying
kingpin out here at some point doesn't
need to be tomorrow but you know we're
looking at an office option would be a
good opportunity for you to come out
bring them along and do some
overclocking
bring some ln2 in or something like that
it'd be fun but sync it up with the next
time he's in the states I guess if you
if you're watching what kind of build
are you planning doing for the new Nass
I'm not sure I've gotten a lot of
extremely helpful emails from all of you
who watch that and know a lot about raid
and network-attached storage and all
that stuff so I'm going to I'm still
reading through them I'm not replying
every single one I am reading them and
I'll choose after I read through all
those ten dollars from DVD blackjack
thank you very much no message that mug
fish one hundred Norwegian kroner almost
anything with limited edition and the
name sells well because that is the only
reason I bought the 8086 K go figure
still resisting the still resting in the
package though well apparently they're
good chips based on what I'm seeing here
so Ben Grogan two dollars live rip LTX
overclocked off that'd be fun I don't
know if Linus will have the time to do
live overclocking versus each other but
it I have some ideas for the future I
haven't figured them out yet but I have
some ideas for live overclocked offs
like you're talking about Devon five
dollars may be purchased for the limited
edition shirt and incorrectly filled in
my address oops I sent an email with the
correct address sorry Lal no problem
it's cool we have a guy who does a great
job with support if you do have a
problem like that just email support at
gamers Nexus thought that he will make
sure you get the thing that you bought
don't worry about it just send an email
with your order number and the correct
address we'll get it fixed for you no no
worries at all
5.3 gigahertz is running it's dropping
every now and then 252 96 I saw a little
flicker that looked like some corruption
but it's holding relatively and we're
still in the 60s for temperatures so
we're doing okay right now let me let me
pop up one of these and we pop up one of
the hotter cores okay so you've got two
cores open this is just a temperature
readout it's just kind of what I'm gonna
do is look at these sort of mentally
average them after a moment or two of
running this is frequency just make sure
that's really stable and then we'll know
if this thing's actually any good for it
for the clock that is another one $2.00
from Nathan what CPU did you
lgt with that was the 79 80 XE as you
damn well know as a near memes Luke
Norman $10 got a delay today someone who
came ax is out at 5.2 gigahertz at 1.4 3
volts but temp peak at high 90s low 60s
during gaming using an H 115 I Pro
cooler will a custom leave get the max
temps down the 70s so it depends custom
loops can be as effective and I mean
that in like almost ineffective can be
they can perform the same as a closed
loop if they have similar pumps you can
definitely push a pump too hard if you
have too many big radiators so there's a
lot of factors at play but if you get a
good pump and what do you say have h 115
h 115 that's a 280 so if you get a good
pump a 280 radiator and good fans it
will be better if you get good fans it
will also be better and you don't need
to buy all the other stuff unless you
start sizing up the radiator what that
will do is just give you more liquid to
soak the heat into so sort of the the
thermal saturation point we'll call it
will be pushed out farther so I've found
with a 280 CLC we tend to hit
steady-state liquid temperature at about
15 minutes of really intensive prime
burnin and with a bigger radiator like a
360 or 420 you start hitting the
steady-state point later so if you're
dealing with spurious up/down voltages
which is what happens when you're gaming
especially if you have an adaptive
voltage offset not an override if you
have an adaptive voltage offset and
you're gaming gaming is not like prime
or fire strike it will sort of drop the
voltage as you hit menus and loading
screens in places where you don't need
the frequency or the voltage to sustain
a frequency at given frequency so if you
hit a black loading screen for example
you're not rendering anything so the
point is we were playing like a game
having those bigger radiators can help
because over the period of of playing a
game for half an hour an hour it's
taking longer to
studies state it's a pretty minor thing
the bigger thing that will actually fix
your problem is just better fans
honestly and I don't if you have like
the stock coarser friends you can
definitely do better you can even keep
the same radiator keep your cost way
down to 80s are great the H 115 is great
to put good fans on it and that'll help
a lot also
the D lighting helps a lot ok so we're
pretty stable here at this is like there
we go okay so we're bouncing up and down
a little bit the scales are awful it
looks way more exaggerated than it is
for example the top to the bottom of
this peak is like 1 megahertz I should
have done that I guess whatever and our
temperatures are looking ok - so we're
gonna we can push this now a bit further
and see if we can get I don't know 5
point 4 I guess I think we're gonna
start hitting a wall
the sickness 550 disturbed reference
well of GN please call out a vtec-e a
tiny Channel reviewer 1.3 K subs I guess
mostly cases I try to help him out ideas
a great guy - I'll a BTEC e there's a
shout out Justin Murphy $4.99 I'm
starting to think you guys are being
sabotage with all these issues lately
question is it LT t or coolermaster I
don't know cooler master should be
pretty happy right now because we just
reviewed that H 500 exceptionally
positively I like that case so I'm gonna
go with - that is definitely rational 54
is what we're going for for the
multiplier CP ratio 54 and I'm gonna get
to the store orders in a moment the rule
is if you buy something during the
stream we have the limited edition shirt
that will no longer be available as the
stream ends it will be gone forever I
think this is gonna crash we'll see I'm
going to try and read every first name
and where you're from for that for any
purchases from the store mod mats shirts
whatever but some of its gonna get
pushed to the end so right now we're
pushing for 5 point 4 gigahertz someone
I'll get through some more of these
questions are some good ones here five
point four at one point four volts I
think it will crash we will find out
though Jerald two dollars thanks for a
great content Thank You gerald for the
two bucks
Alex two dollars time for bed almost
1:30 here 19-point the 19,000 463 on
fire strike by the way nice good job
depend on your components that's you
know it's pretty good score Tiger Balm
20 bucks
Wow thank you will you sell a new hat
design possibly something with the
graphed logo you know we had it's not a
new design we don't sell these currently
but this is the graph logo on a hat so I
don't know if there's interest I guess
let me know in chat I'm right we we
don't sell as many hats as shirts and
other things so if you like this one do
let me know because it's kind of like
it's not discontinued but I'm not
actively ordering them so there's
interest I'll order more certainly we
can do other colors and stuff too we can
do different designs all right
I'd buy a hat someone says this is not
booting so now I get to use my special
button over here and that's just a reset
button that I wired up to the
motherboard so it's a bit faster I think
I hit reset yes it is cycling right now
there we go all right so let me read
through more of these Tim LLL voting by
on hat yes blue jean shirt and the cube
I like the graph logo the most yeah a
lot of people like that one I'd buy a
hat okay so there's not Fentress we can
order a couple I guess are you going to
LT act yes I will be there if you're
there come say hi I think Linus has me
on a like a Q&amp;amp;A panel with them did you
see that this blue screen or did it just
go black just went black so let's we're
gonna try booting again just in case it
was a fluke five point four one point 4
volts
Tim lol 2 bucks Thank You Brendan five
dollars live rip lt's yet linus conned
by one of his shirts and Hulk Hogan Hulk
Hogan the out of it I that would be
embarrassing probably mostly for me
because I don't think I'd be able to
I'll - I like pre cut it with scissors
ryan johnson $2 buy deal it a dye or
deal it 87 RK now or wait for i 9
okay I don't know the answer to this
yeah that's gonna crash
to answer this always for me is are you
happy with your current system for
example we have a rendering system that
is actively frustrating us that would be
a point at which I would say stop
waiting and just by if you're pretty
happy with your system and you don't
have noticeable things that are
bothering you or slowing you down or
like if you notice that the system is a
problem in any way then just by and if
you're pretty happy with it just wait
that's how I do it
everyone kind of approaches that
differently but I think most the
youtubers will tell you the same thing
we're trying 1.42 volts at 5.4 gigahertz
our multiplier is 54 right now sorry now
we're just trying to get its boot mb2
dollars what's your take on gigabyte 370
or us gaming 7 thanks X 370 I think that
board was fine the X I honestly don't
remember that board very well that's 470
is super overkill though in a good way
so export seventies a good one build
Zoid from actually hardcore overclocking
has lots of PCB analysis videos he does
work for us as well but he also has his
own channel actually hardcore
overclocking where he talks up all those
motherboards so it definitely check him
out he might have done one for us on
that board but I don't remember yeah
sorry I don't that I can tell you that X
470 version of that board is really good
though the vrm is like insane mostly the
cooler though totally unnecessary but
nice to have Mustaine's by matt $5 i
miss the beginning are you using a
rocket cool kit i used it on my new i7
to get 49 10 megahertz at one point 3 to
5 volts so i am i used the rocket cool
kit to deal it it and I'm using I
cleaned it scraped off all of the
silicon adhesive that's a big deal with
deleting it it does just as much as the
liquid metal then I put thermal grisly
conduct a knot on it which is linked
below if you want some as they are a
vert Iser for the stream today so yeah I
use the rocket cool kit
it's it's a good cheap kit like it does
it does well and it's affordable so I
like that one
okay 1.40 is what we were at let's try
one point four three is just see if we
can get this thing to boot at five point
four gigahertz this may be starting to
hit our limitation to build so and join
in chat finally the chat works for me
builds lloyd says build Zoids in chat
he's actually hardcore overclocking I
don't know if chat lets you click on
people's names if it does click on his
name okay so let me see it builds Lloyd
messaging me at all no okay
got to make sure so I know how much he's
judging me two dollars from Adam I
figured did I already hit this one or
did you just say it again tell Andrew
he's a good camera man and 3d modeler
this is the second time thank you Adam
Thomas five bucks we're just trying to
get this table right now guys and with
me
so Thomas thank you best technical info
out there I love patreon discord thank
to you for joining we like having the
community I have an X 99 rampage five
and sixty eight hundred K would that
work well for a Home Server even without
Ezz I mean yeah if you need ECC you
probably know that you need ECC so it
depends on like what your servers doing
I guess I'm not an expert on server
hardware I'm not an expert on Zeon's or
on ECC or anything like that but I can
tell you that if you need ezc you would
know it and if you don't then it's fine
like the sixty-eight hundred sixty nine
hundred both good CPUs they're great for
like if you want a box that just sits
there and compresses stuff for example
two dollars from Adam again says I
missed that sorry
we appreciate it anyway Adam 20 bucks
from Alex any chances of pink GN
kid-sized shirts for those of us with
families that is very specific I will be
honest with you right now there's not a
plan for that I don't know honestly how
much of a
sighs audience we have I mean I guess I
do are 13 to 17 audience is a lot
smaller than our 24 to whatever the
range is 24 34 something like that and
35 plus so I don't currently have any
plans for it if there is interest going
forward like in the future sure we can
definitely add them you know the squeaky
wheel gets the grease remind me every
now and then we can look into that stuff
as we grow and as we get more viewers
with kids who want something like that
but no current plans 1.45 was no good
for us kind of hitting my comfort zone
here so you know what let's let's just
leave that one point four or five and
let's go down to so let's go to 101 be
CLK let's go down to 53 core ratio and
see what that does that'll get us 250
350 megahertz so it won't quite be 54
but it's pretty damn close got more
things to read the Martin one two three
what CPU is that also cube question mark
the CPU is the 8086 k thank you very
much meme master is all over chat today
try to move in memory OS see I don't
there isn't a memory or C right now
tomfoolery five dollars learned how to
deal it from GN oh yeah I guess the cube
reference in that previous one was for
our teardown cubes these things right
here this is the medium sized one these
are awesome so they're like 3d laser
engraved cubes that have our teardown
logo on it's the same logo that's on my
shirt actually except in 3d and see if
we can so you can see it's 3d I think
that's what that reference was - we've
actually I think we sold out of these we
have more coming in this month yeah
there you go that's a great shot so you
can see like screws in there there's
like little screws that hold in fake PCB
components so there's blower fans
MOSFETs vrm components all that stuff we
have this on the store on store décadas
access Donette the big one is in stock I
think this one is out of stock though
but we are working on getting more in so
if that was your reference with the
comment cube then hopefully that answers
it I think we only have two more Super
chats for me to get through so I can
look at some of the store or shot outs
and we can get to this booted by the way
so 5350 booted not stable but it booted
Thank You Strazza
and sergeant Zeta very much for the cube
link in chat tomfoolery
five bucks learned how to deal it from
GN videos went from 65 C Idol on a 3770k
it's a 27 C maxes out at 58 C at 107
prime gave my old CPU new life that is
great to hear I'm so happy to hear that
you guys get anything from all this
stuff overclocking there's a lot of fun
it's something I'm happy to pray for
awareness to like you shouldn't be
scared of it just be really careful of
of voltages just kind of do some
research on your architecture make sure
you're staying within a reasonable
voltage and mostly be careful the the
SOC voltage on risin and the SI system
agent voltage on Intel those are the two
that you need to be careful of those the
two that can kill stuff or degrade stuff
the most easily if you're if you type in
something too high but other than that
don't be afraid to overclock I'm glad to
hear that we helped you get interested
in deleting it's not difficult it's a
lot of fun there is an inherent risk
with it but if you follow the guide
you'll be okay Ryan five bucks I guess I
should have specified on 8700 waiting
for ninety nine hundred K this is a new
build that I'm getting parts for first
Desktop builds out but anxious thank you
first desktop I don't know when the 99
hundred K comes out I am not even under
NDA so so I have no idea when that's
coming out and if you are waiting for an
indefinite period I don't know it
depends how patient you are that's it
just becomes a really personal question
at that point I am NOT that patient with
that kind of stuff like if I want a new
computer if I'm building a new computer
whatever I'll typically just do it the
performance difference will likely not
be mom is that gonna be the eight core
that might be eight cores it could be a
significant performance difference but
we don't know what the price is going to
be so if it's like more expensive than I
don't know it's all speculative I would
say
it's probably gonna be more expensive
anyway so I don't know I definitely
don't feel buyer's remorse it's a few
months out probably so I don't have a
great answer I would be inclined to say
don't wait if you are wanting to get
this done now it's really just comes
down to that but don't feel buyer's
remorse components are always going to
be obsolete like the minute you buy them
they'll perform well for many many years
you can be good for five years on a 700
K or whatever and yeah it's just it's
the nature of the beast the stuff is new
quarterly almost physics score twenty
three thousand to twenty three that's
really promising if you remember so this
is largely because of our memory change
at this point we have PCL K of 101 now
so if you're wondering where the heck
did we went from 21 99223 2 to 3 pretty
big jump for only a 50 megahertz
increase we went from five point three
to five point three five
so the real change here is a base clock
which went from 100 to 102 101 point
zero and that increases our memory
frequency and a couple of other things
so what this is telling me 24 might be
achievable with a change in memory so we
can try throwing some memory tuning I'm
gonna switch over to it's the g.skill
memory in a moment see if we can push
that a bit further than this one let me
get through a couple more of these
Nickolas 20 bucks Wow thank you will you
directly say it's very very demanding no
you directly say hello sandy to my wife
also tell her that Nicholas loves you
priceless there you go it's a little bit
hopefully we take that the right way
it's going from Nikolas I assume your
significant other haha yes husband okay
it's going from Nikolas or hey Martin
two bucks
I meant the coolest cube of ice cubes
damn it I thought ice cubes it's still
doing that mean
everyone wanted an ice cube added to
this thing
this right here this this is one of my
favorite systems we've ever built
everyone wanted us to add an ice cube to
this reservoir to try and get an extra
couple megahertz out of the clock so if
you missed that live stream that's the
reference to cube I guess and this will
come back and to use at some point I
have some plans for it you read the last
two before I switch over to box bill one
cello with interchanging capital letters
tell Andrew he's a good cameraman 30
poeple hear a five box were Dudley
micash Schroedinger dangerous thing to
name a cat wanted me to send some money
for snowflakes get some catnip Thank You
Schroedinger
we appreciate you making your your human
send us money for our Overlord okay so
I'm going to switch the memory I don't
know we probably don't really need to
show this on camera but all I'm doing is
pulling out the Corsair stuff which is
right here and I'm gonna drop in two
sticks of the g.skill memory that I know
does really well of course there's
gotten us pretty far for the stream but
we need more
I do have 46 hundred megahertz course
they're kids here but it's to be an IMC
debate and then you're gonna be watching
me change memory timings for six hours
which no one wants so we're just going
to go with something I know kinda what
the parameters are so I'm not a memory
expert so I can do the basics all right
so we just switched to the G scale
Triton Z black boot this thing up
and start tuning memory trying to get
our 24,000 score out of fire strength
that is the score to beat
yes five point three five gigahertz is
where we are right now
so we were at 101 B CLK it's actually
been a very smooth overclocking stream
so far 101 B CLK
knock on wood and that was 553 X 1 point
4 volts from point 4 5 volts something
like that pretty damn good though 52 was
really good 5 point 2 gigahertz that did
super well ok memory time so a couple
things here I want to get through the
last I got through the Super chats nice
ok so the store as fewer orders I didn't
know what I was getting myself into you
thank you very much the huh so I
promised everyone I would read first
name where you're from and what you
bought or to do as many as I can while
we're doing the the most exciting task
in the world memory overclocking and
then or timings tuning and and then
we'll get through a bunch at the end I
think so diogo that's an interesting
name from California got a limited
edition foil shirt lightweight Raglan
hoodie which we just restocked by the
way if you've wanted one there now in
stock and another limited edition shirt
thank you very much Diego got one from
Michael from Ohio limited Church
thank you Michael George from UK limited
shirt back button back skate that
backspace doesn't work apparently Joshua
from Texas limited edition shirt mod mat
thank you very much
Joshua you were one of the few who
bought one during the stream this time
and a keychain and the mod mats will be
in stock very soon they should be on the
way to us limited-edition shirt from
Andreas in Germany Thank You andreas
when I get back to the memory
overclocked in a second give me a moment
guys I did say I would read these jian
mod matte autographs thank you very much
william from is that Germany oh no way
you asked but it looks like it's
Oh gotcha a us sorry sorry about that
I saw a de and I just jumped to Germany
chase us purchased a limited-edition
shirt maybe a couple more Ben from the
u.s. limited-edition shirt that's very
popular item we could call to close the
sales today I guess
Jeffrey us also at Pennsylvania I could
State got a a limited-edition shirt okay
alright so what I'm gonna do is
reference our previous overclocking
thing rip LTT was where I got these
numbers so the hashtag rip Ltd stream is
the last time this memory was was really
pushing numbers for us and we had it at
fourth out of the zone Saturday 980 XE
you mind you we have 4,000 megahertz be
damn 1.85 pretty aggressive TCL 16 1640
our CDs 1640 RP 2640 wrath so let's just
start setting some of those I don't know
if we're gonna do 4,000 but it kind of
depends on the IMC I know the memory can
do 4,000 I don't know what the CPU can
do let's just train it a bit first so
we'll boot it at 36 and let's do 16
we're just what else do we do TR CD we
can do 16 trp acts time rass act time I
think we did 26 last time for tear ass
pretty damn aggressive and command rate
one a couple other settings we can do
here 16 16 26 frequencies at 3600 right
now what else do we have we had
secondary timing so TR Rd under square s
4 and T rrdl is 6 let's just see if
those hold on this this CPU ref cycle
time T ref what did I have a t ref last
time
3277 nope that's the wrong one thinking
of tea RFC or something like that tea
RFC I had three hundred and thirty to
seventy seven forty re fi there you go
tre a 5/32 7/27 that's the Refresh
interval I think I'm gonna stop here I
have some more written down that I can
set but I kind of want to stop here and
just see if it even boots so let's do
that are we still at 101 we're still at
101 BC okay I think yes okay
53 101 bc lk 1 point 4 5 volts for the
core i haven't not done anything with
kashish probably do that but one thing
at a time I think
DRAM voltage we're gonna need to
increase 25 why not do that first let's
hear that does DRAM can take a hell of a
lot of volts you're just talking about
the IMC surviving at this point but I
don't care about it because I'm just
overclocking for a bit so it just needs
to survive the overclocking oh yeah this
is a great point from a builds way to
actually hardcore overclocking said if
anything 87 hard K chips probably now
range 4.9 to 5.1 since all the better
chips would be 8086 k's that is
absolutely true
a lot of the all the 8086 days are Bend
8700 s so that's true
there it's cycling right now I'm just
gonna let it cycle a few times see if it
trains the timing isn't working so we'll
just give it some time to think about
its life but yeah 8086 k is our
allegedly limited edition intel pulled a
bunch of 8700 k's off the line
pre-selected the good ones and called
them 8086 KS and that's what we're
working on today so that's where that
CPU came from which means that probably
eighty-seven arcades might be a bit
lower on average frequency now
the Martin $5 will you consider
value-added features when picking CV
platform eg will you pick rise into our
obtain accelerated Steam library on hard
drive with Intel I mean if I care about
those things yes like if I want
streaming capabilities I'll consider
risin like as in a machine that stream
is a streaming PC while gaming then I
would consider isin or high-end Intel so
this is clearly not booting let's do a
stew a hard reboot see if it can figure
it out I just hit the reset button so
we're gonna let it cycle a few times see
if it trains and if it doesn't then I'll
drop the settings a bit it might be
going to the safe mode right now turned
on yeah
safe mode okay so I need to those
timings a bit it would appear no big
surprise these are my weakest point drop
this to 100 first just reduce the
variables a bit and then go back and
look at the timings make sure I didn't
type anything in incorrectly or too
aggressively so far we're doing really
damn well we're at 23,000 points and
firestrike my score to beat today is 24k
so we're not far from it at all I think
I might just try a less optimistic
memory setting 10 bucks from Dixon Ice
Cube in res with the hashtag not on this
one you bastards and here's the closed
loop cooler this time no Ice Cube for
you alright this is not booting once
again just hit that reset button see
what we can get to okay got an order and
from Caesar from the US limited edition
shirt
thank you very much Caesar got one in
from Thomas I think I saw your name
earlier super chat maybe Thomas from the
u.s. Graff logo shirt that's a good one
we're almost out of those two I think
that was the tribe lunch graft logo
limited edition shirt from Logan I think
in the US
Christian from California limited
edition shirt this is still let's try a
boot again
reset one more time before I do a harder
to boot Thomas from the US picked up a
foil tear down shirt from Indiana and
stone from us also picked up a keychain
and oh yeah
I haven't actually talked how these too
much the mousepad the blue and white
mouse pad that we have on the site is
technically hasn't really been formally
announced but we're making a mousepad
we're gonna make more later so that's on
the store as well we those are in
production already it's having trouble
so I'm gonna hit the red button this is
like the best button in the world on
these things it is a safe boot button if
your motherboard has it so it's just
gonna basically boot without applying
any of the overclock settings and it'll
sit and wait for me to go into BIOS so
that we can get this tuned properly okay
yes so while that is sorting itself out
Jacob from New Jersey a limited edition
shirt Ryan from the US Massachusetts
Limited shirt Michael from from us
limited shirt thank you guys
Steven from the US Limited shirt also
thank you very much we appreciate all
the orders alright so made a bit of a
then f1 it's we're in safe mode right
now which means none of the settings are
actually applied it's giving me a chance
to fix my egregious errors that I've
undoubtedly set upon the BIOS do you RAM
timing let's do let's let's reset some
of these lower timings that should still
be 32 seven 3277 so I want for that one
Otto for the rest 1616 26 that might
that number right there might have the
change it works on the X naught to 99 a
motherboard with seven and EDX II don't
know that will work here technically
it's kind of outside guidance but we're
gonna give it a shot so I've removed the
secondary timing settings going back to
just primary you read some of the chat
stuff for a moment
so yeah Co people I think asking about
what we're at right now
will it be an archive of the stream yes
we are at five point three five
gigahertz right now so five point three
five achieves by 101 BC okay that's
promising
and a nope system posted in Safe Mode
101 be CLK 53 X multiplier and one point
for something volts is what we were at
up until then five point two is stable
like one point three five or something
to that effect one point four really
good vote frequency curve on this chip
alright so this did not like my setup
let's do
stay a bit more voltage
let's do 28 see how that does okay we've
got more we've got a new we have a new
meme Andrea what's happening sergeant's
a de $5 timely communicate to Andrew
that he is a skilled camera operator and
three-dimensional graphic artist Andrew
says oh no put it in a bucket of frozen
internal oil yeah all right not liking
that one either
let's have that safe boot button
actually have to retry button a bit so
retry is another good button it
basically does memory training I don't
know if I I was going for a retry and I
might have hit safe boot but anyway
retries great button on boards if you
have it our memory video recent one
talks about memory training and part of
memory training is just booting over and
over and over until the CPU sorts itself
and figures out some timings because
there are a lot of times that are not
exposed to us even on stuff like Asus
boards we see it like everything you
would think so there are a lot of really
low-level timings that we kept tuned by
the CPU as you're cycling and cycling
can sometimes make it work itself and
and find a stable timing reverend arrow
to box OC Andrew to improve video and 3d
graphic heart what OC Andrew okay is it
gonna boot come on you bastard it's
trying it's just cycling right now I
hear that her the fan spin up a bit
all right so anyway we're at 23 K going
for 24 just need to get it to turn on
it's a bit of a problem and you know I
should do is just boot with XMP and just
see what's going on here it's still
cycling but it little try a few more
times than all food manually per Olaf
from Sweden limited edition teardown
sure Thank You Burt Olaf from Sweden
Thank You Ryan from Australia that's
going a long way for that that tear down
shirt
much appreciated Ryan Brandon from Texas
got the GN blue and white microfiber
cloth mousepad one of the first few Tom
from Ohio picked up the decal and
stickers on the store two large stickers
going to Ohio thank you and John from
California picked up a tear down shirt
thank you very much
hey it turned on it's probably safe
booting but we'll see almost definitely
okay so what we're gonna do is very
simple and I get rid of all the stuff
I'm not positive about and you know what
let's just do this let's do Auto let's
do XMP yes okay
I'm we're doing 101 and are doing in 53
and all of my power settings should
still be in there yes they are okay my
voltage should still be here yes all
right so let's do just that that really
isn't asking a whole lot so that's a
problem and I might switch the two other
sticks of memory okay so it sounds like
it's booting this time excellent Andrea
Framm Kentucky picked up a limited
edition shirt thank you very much Andrew
different andrew james from was that
wisconsin picked up a limited edition
shirt it's booting okay we did fire
strike again it's at thirty six hundred
megahertz with no real tuning right now
maybe that'll be enough for 24 k
Matthew from Canada picked up a
Luminator down shirt foil Andrew from
New York picked up a tear down shirt as
well thank you very much Adam from us
picked up a lightweight Raglan hoodie
and a key chain Thank You Adam
all right through your mark here we go
it's been a little while since we've
done one of these now because I was
trying to get stuff stable a whole lot
has changed but maybe it's enough
24k is what I would like to see by the
end of all this for the physics core
only and we can get a bit by closing all
these applications run it fullscreen all
that stuff but just running it like this
for now CP is getting jump it up a bit
temperature this time need through some
more of these jeremy from canada picked
up a shirt as well david from new mexico
picked up a graph logo shirt get some
variety in there all right I'm gonna
check out chat its builds I saw he says
if I remember correctly UK ones are
basically supremacy blocks the V run
block tacked on I think I know what
you're talking about and if so that's
true
we got one I was wondering if
surrounding the liquid metal with Tim
Wendy lidding would be a good idea to
prevent spill or does the liquid metal
react badly with Tim just don't don't
put a ton of that scores lower don't put
a ton of liquid metal on there you don't
have to worry about spill and like
conformal coating or captain tape or
nail polish work better if you are
worried about spill over there are
instances where you'll kind of coat the
entire thing I've seen it for some
overclocking setups I'm sure builds I
could maybe identify when you might want
to coat like everything with their own
pace but no I I wouldn't recommend it
you just you know don't use a lot of
liquid metal you'll be fine thrown this
again let's run this without some of the
stuff in the background
and see what kind of real score we get
run all right
okay so a couple more Super chats
alright hey these are uh yes got this
one got this one got the Andrew meme
that has popped up now Brendan five
bucks were you doing some downhill
mountain biking your arms are ten as
 and your hands are super white and
you've got a big boo-boo on your forearm
that is extremely what do you call it
observant of you there yeah
yeah I mean I wear I work gloves and
then like this parts not covered by
armed guards yeah I was doing it I was I
was doing some downhill biking last
weekend actually I'll be there and some
more coming up that those videos we go
into the GM steep channel this this
season I'm saving up a lot of though I'm
gonna start scheduling downhill mountain
bike videos on the GM Steve's side
Channel
twenty three two one seven run it one
more time just so we get an idea what
kind of variance we have run to run here
that was 22 523 200 it's a bit of jumps
am i getting spammed on discord or on my
phone everywhere oh I need to give build
Zoid mod status so he can answer
questions faster yeah so we've got that
running another pass what do I create
moderators channel I don't know where to
create moderators community settings I
think that's it yeah that's it okay
moderators actually hardcore overclock
no matches found actually a hardcore
score 23 3 3 9 there's your variance 222
523 3 3 9 that's quite a bit so we're
getting really close about 700 points
away from what I want to see you tonight
why is it not finding you that is super
annoying let's try a channel link maybe
build Zoids in chat by the way actually
that's actually a hardcore overclocking
there we go gotcha
okay build you're at it as a moderator
now you should be able to respond to
questions faster alright how did you
indulge I'd meet someone I know in the
industry pointed me to want to build
toy's videos quite a while ago around
the RX 400h and I messaged him and I was
like do you want to analyze some PCBs
for us and he said yes okay so 23 to the
nine I don't know
let's just play around and buy us the
memory and see what we can do yeah so
the mountain biking question was good
because it lets me point to the side
channel and I'm going to start uploading
a bunch of downhill runs not going
really editing heavy on them yet but
mostly just trail ride throughs and I'll
be at Whistler briefly after Linus's
Expo after Alti exile Vienna and
Whistler doing downhill part so if
you're out there come say hi
okay so let's just do the simplest thing
and increase this a bit let's increase
that to thirty seven seventy see that
boots see what's stable okay
just always wear your helmet Steve yeah
I wear quite a bit of armor neck brace
full face helmet everything okay so
replaces him with whipped cream you know
that would probably be more thermally
conductive than some of the stock
thermal paste we've seen in the past
accra de axud two bucks over the years
I've developed a fine set of okay that's
we're gonna stop reading their cat
herder hi Fox you might improve your
viewership and score if you featured
cats in this livestream hashtag give us
snowflake snowflake is a scary variable
to introduce near like a streaming
computer on the floor and a benchmarking
computer she would be fine I don't know
the computers would be she likes to
crawl like under benches or really
anywhere anywhere she can that gets a
lot of attention from everybody so
although she's good for a roll shots for
like news unfortunately she's she's a
bit of a liability when we're talking
live streams run tests what are we gonna
get I want 24,000 points
bill one charlo five bucks it would be
kind to please inform andrew of his
impeccable performance in the art of
arranging 3d objects andrew says he
likes this new meme i haven't and that
he he would like to see it continue
i think that's what you said right
alright let us see that 4600 megahertz
that is what's making me want to get a
new bill it snowflake you leave the
cable I should leave the cables alone
but she'll crawl into stuff next to the
power spike Dan lower score starting to
hit heat issues too at the room
temperature at this point so that's
always a concern just run this again
just for sake of variance get rid of
hardware info okay see how that does
why isn't dry ice used for cooling you
mean like now or always probably
probably obvious why you wouldn't use it
like they today there you go but I'm not
using it here because I don't know and
don't have any probably gonna close loop
cooler it seemed easy all right so we
crashed there so close so is these last
this last like our just fighting for it
for the last ten percent of the score
that I want this from the pressure is on
okay so that was not really stable so
let's do some of this where is okay so I
had four thousand Tigers this is on x2
99v damn 125 TCL 16 to our CD 16 TRP
1626 somehow for this one I don't know
how that was stable but it's having
trouble here
what else did I have commander it should
be one rrdl t rrdl 6-4 okay
wow that's a very high ref cycle time
refresh cycle time let's try and bring
this I think it is a stable at 300 on
the other system but I just said - 500
for starters cuz that's 660 right now
which is super-high under that one what
else we have refresh cycle time 300 RTP
rrdl got that RTP Auto t far do we have
T flow anywhere
aw
4 x 1 x 42 hello 40 might be fine
I've seen anyone you got that TW are 24
right to read delay I think that's this
one let's leave this alone for now and
then RWD are at all at 6 RW d RW d r r
dr dr d our d WR okay i WD r 6 this is
what I had last time
6 DD 6 don't know if those are gonna be
stable this will see we shall see if it
will boot my knees go up on the voltage
also builds right if you're still there
feel free to pain me on this chord if
you have suggestions for the memory it
sounds like it's trying
cycling at the reset button retry okay
it's it's retrying see ya boots into
safe from hurt her not okay Andrew I
don't know what to do about this the
store order thing the shout-outs restore
orders thing I got to find a solution
for it
there are a lot of orders today thank
you all very much obviously we're
ecstatic about it it's a lot of things
to read I'm trying to also overclock
this and keep it entertaining so bear
with me I'm not going on yeah so having
trouble with those settings it's not too
happy with them I'm going to safe boot
and remove a bunch of them I don't know
what to do next I guess I really just
want to tighten the other timings this
kit should be pretty damn good I wonder
if I could just voltage maybe that's
what it really needs
do you think AMD would ever do a
low-cost threader for APU ten bucks from
Jacob APU
I don't know I don't think so I'm gonna
go with no right now cuz all that die
space is kind of dedicated to being
thread ripper that's like the whole
point of it is a lot of CPU cores and
stuff like that a lot of cash like oars
start pulling that away and giving 40%
of the diet an APU I just I don't see
the value really no we don't want 13
volts come on more volts then coming out
of the power supply yeah I don't I don't
really see it to be honest I could see
why you would want it just so you don't
need a GPU to boot and see video but it
doesn't seem like it fits the product
oh okay status and Anthea has a white
paper on a theoretical exascale tr4
based AP oh well there you go I don't
know if it would still be like proper
thread ripper at that point it's just if
it's just the tr4 socket I don't know
apparently there's white paper out there
for something though okay I can get rid
of those timings
what are we had on the CPU now 30 50 350
is where we are right now we're at 53 50
megahertz for the CPU at one point four
or five volts for there abouts we're
doing pretty damn well it's just a
memory that's what I'm trying to do and
this is always like the most boring part
I'm also not the best at it so takes a
bit longer but we're gonna get somewhere
eventually around timing let's get let's
try 36 right here and just see if that
boots I'm just kind of changing things
one at a time right now see what what
it'll take
we got a couple fins here
- barks bill on cello get yourself some
Taco Bell after the stream thank you
Bill
I don't know there might not be any more
streams if we get a Taco Bell Jay Jardin
five bucks
save us $500 on bench with that 4,600
Ram kit you have to see if it is worth
buying we've done it
then we publish that information it
might have done something with it the
problem with forty-six hundred megahertz
ram is you need good RAM which they they
should have guarantee you you need a
good motherboard you need it's not just
a good CPU but you need a CPU that
clunks high on the core cuz obviously
that's what everyone wants but also has
basically a bin die MC so you need a CPU
that has to bend like good components
and 46-hundred is really hard to achieve
he event like you can't plug and play
4,600 you can if you have a really good
CP oh sure but the trouble with it again
is just that you're talking about
something where
it's like Asher it requires too many
good components to realistically work
out of the box you can kind of tune it
it'll work eventually timings are really
loose like I don't know steal 20 or
something maybe higher
so yeah tough to say you know it's what
extent you would really want to work
with those kids sometimes there's more
value to having like CL 11 or 12 then 46
hundred megahertz - David - bucks just a
really hard on the CPU easy over clocks
bill on cello two dollars Wow Andrew
great moves keep it up
proud of you Andrew says h3h3 reference
of the intro clip Ian two dollars can
you please crow out your beard hashtag
Tech Jesus not currently in the plans I
guess alright
top stable frequency so far five point
three five gigahertz and I might just
make this kind of easy and in a second
here and limit what we're doing with
memory and just see what we can get
because we only need 700 more points and
fire so I could get what I want
so I don't know we might not need to go
ham on this let's simplify things a bit
I want to bring the frequency down this
time
I'm just I'm changing one thing at a
time see if it becomes stable from one
of those changes
mmm okay does anyone know a good way to
check what dye is in your memory kit the
best way well google search it some kits
are guaranteed be died or whatever but
they're not always guaranteed so the
best way is to carefully take the heat
spreader off and look at it and then
look up the number on it and it should
be online somewhere you'll know it's
beat ie die whatever it's booting this
time so I don't know didn't like the
frequency and my timings are not very
good right now because I was loosening
them up to try and figure out what the
problem was but let's just run a fire
strike run anyway
it's been a little while see what our
scores gotten worse from all that or
better because I have not really
improved then I thinned what I've got
into booting physics not looping window
no turn all this off physics run custom
okay all right so we're at 23 something
three hundred twenty two thousand three
hundred I think is where we were and I
want twenty four thousand someone's
asking out the processor the processor
is deleted the cooler is a Kraken X 62
does a heat spreader come off by pulling
no it does on mine cuz I deleted it so
heat spreader is held on by silicon
adhesive and that silicone adhesive sits
around the outside of the die so what
happens is you you put it in basically
like a mini vise and pop the IHS off and
I'll show you where the silicone
adhesive layer is on this G 5500 I have
in front of me in a minute
so our score 23100 all right good so I
hasn't gotten worse not really anyway
owner around one more because there's
some variants mentally average it and
then we will get back to the memory now
that I know the problem was the
frequency is this some extent okay so
this is a CPU
it's a G 5500 to answer your question no
the heat spreader doesn't just come off
and the way you know this isn't always
true but you can typically tell if it's
soldered or not by looking
we got a blue screen by the way by
looking in the corner or around the
edges and if you see like let me find
like a pointing utility there we go
if you see some black glue like material
sticking around the edges there then
that is silicone adhesive and basically
the Vice will apply pressure against
this IHS to braces against it it pushes
while the substrate is braced not moving
and eventually the glue breaks away on
some dyes like the AAP use the rise and
stuff it's more risky because there are
actually small SMDs under the IHS
whereas with Intel it's a bare IHS so
it's actually more or less completely
safe to do because there's not a real
chance of hitting any SM DS because
there aren't any all right you know
let's just see if it does this one more
time hopefully that answers your
question though I actually have some
other cool props here I should pull out
but I have a bear GPU that's not
soldered to a PCB that's pretty cool
damn it if you didn't catch that fire
strike does a thing or it'll recheck all
the settings okay well that works too
that's actually faster so okay let's get
back in the BIOS kind of have an idea of
what the problem is now this maybe we
can make some progress about 22100 am
close is it tomfoolery two bucks just
wanted to say hashtag tech cheese's
thanks for the two bucks tomfoolery
okay
here's my other cool prop show that off
in a minute okay so what do I want to do
drop B CLK increase DRAM voltage where's
si do I have si in here system agent
voltage there we go nine point three
five let's try that that's by too high
so it's one point three let's do one
point three let's see how that does
system agent might help out of it kind
of pushing high on everything at this
point Steve better buy a tasty food with
that money are we voting on what you get
for dinner yet
I like this meme that's maybe it gives
me something to greatly look forward to
you after streams I love doing the
streams I also love getting food after
them because for some reason this is a
lot more demanding than doing the videos
we do like the shorter videos which is
just a lot of testing so alright this is
well this is like sorting itself here's
the prop I was talking about okay so
this is I don't sorry one sec I don't
know what GPU this is I got this in 2012
from a an engineer in the silicon
analysis lab silicon failure analysis
lab a ten videos old campus so 2012 I
was my first trip over to California and
first trip for business of obviously to
California and so he had a great lab we
have an old video of it where he give us
a walk through I think his name is
Howard Marks and if you just searched
the channel for silicon failure analysis
lab it might come up it's an old old
video I'm the quality is not very good
by our standards today is 2012 whatever
but the stuff in the lab is really cool
and this is one of the chips he give he
gave us so this is he's heat of course
being an Nvidia employee obviously
promoted Nvidia a bit and said some kind
of spiel like you won't find these many
places it's a
NVIDIA GPU so okay whatever but the cool
thing was that it's a non soldered one
so this is more or less what they look
like I mean it's yeah it's so you got
the BGA back here obviously not socket
into a board so there's your substrate
there's all the ball grid array and then
you have some really small SM DS around
the border like caps and stuff like that
silicon adhesive or actually you know
what yeah this is adhesive and it's for
that little metal bracket they used to
put on the outside on the GPU dive so
that's one of the props just remember
that from joining the CPU a minute ago
this blue screen wants and just boot it
now and it blue screen again so clearly
what did I even change this time si and
IO voltage that's it no that's like not
great news what should i do should I try
the coarser memory with tighter time
Ian's
maybe 23,000 wear really want 24 oh yeah
a GB is pretty cool
I'll check chat let's see if anyone
commented on it but see we're there any
benchmarking tools for Linux there is
there's a great benchmarking tool by
veronik yeah veronik says a really good
benchmarking tool and it's it's just got
like everything in it it's free to use I
think Bill joint says the GP looks like
Fermi that's probably accurate from the
time all right okay builds oh I see
you're in chat any suggestions on what
we should do I need like 700 more points
I know it's doable
I'll check this chord and see if you
messaged me I can use your help at this
point so you might want to give up on
one T command rate okay let's try that
any other thoughts mister actually
hardcore over talking it's too I guess
what are your other thoughts
there's your memory screen so build Zoid
ladies and gentlemen helping us out
right now he's messaging me on discord
builds ID runs the channel actually
hardcore overclocking he does some
videos for us as well with PCB
analysis of ER Em's and components like
that we are actually haven't announced
is officially yet but I've been talking
to him about potentially trying to get
him out here to do some kind of videos
together in person so he's saying you
should be able to do like four thousand
fourteen fourteen fourteen twenty eight
tutti 1.85 so let's try yeah builds
right I'd like to get sixteen stable
first so maybe we should just see if
this to this one T command rate is what
was causing my boot failures before we
move to a CL 14
here are the other settings for anyone
who wants to see them and four builds or
to correct them this I want I want tiara
eat a refresh cycle time to be 300 or so
I know it can do it it's at five ten
right now
RAF I should do 65,000 okay is it our
EFI is that when i refresh interval okay
cool got it
so t fought 16 TC okay er FC 240 he
wants let's try that this might be a bit
of grass suit but Cheney is 2 T I guess
will help a lot it was the other
suggestion you had teef on TC WL t far
where is for act 1 time T 16 oh wait
1.85 I want for the votes
8 5 build Zoid thoughts on iOS a
voltages things like that
there they are if you have any thoughts
on them so build zyyd again is an expert
overclocker does great work he does
liquid nitrogen overclocking he does
some live streams live streams where he
saw her stuff together we're getting his
help right now just as a phone a friend
for the last 700 points I need seems
regular that we got the Ellen 2 guys in
to help out for those last few points
I'm just gonna try booting with that
while I wait for his further thoughts
we're still at CL 16 I just want to get
it to turn on right now
Iona sa should be fine as is builds oh
it says they are 1.3 right now if you
miss those foreign it doesn't know
system agent si is the voltage on Intel
motherboards that you tuned when you are
starting to push memory clocks system
agent voltage and iOS IOH si is more
sensitive than i/o in that if you push
it too hard you'll get IMC or integrated
memory controller degradation on the CPU
mmm-hmm he's saying the chip should be 5
gigahertz on cord you know that's a good
point I haven't touched on core and I
should and that is definitely a very
good point
all right we have a lot of us we got a
blue screen build Zoid
we have a lot of store orders I'm gonna
have to try and get through at some
point to hopefully once this thing's
running benchmarks for stability okay
there we go
so let's see you know let's just get a
100 BC okay just to simplify things and
build Zoid anything in here that you
want to reduce the aggression on while
we're looking at it I've got a blue
screen last time I'm at one point eight
five one point for whatever for memory
voltage and he thoughts mr. beezy got
six for all these I don't know if that's
gonna be a problem
that's the settings I had for the X
$2.99 motherboard with the 79-80 XE for
our rip LT t stream worked on that one
dropped to 38 66 I think our memory
clocks already low it's not 4,000 right
now I think it's currently set to 3,600
so 38 66 would be an increase at 3400
let's go to 36 let's try that just
neither's last 710 points and fire
strike to call it
okay what's chat saying Steve showed AG
200 Tesla 2.0 chip is that what it is no
no that's what it was
someone said your rambin sucks this Ram
is actually done pretty well I might try
the other two sticks I don't know unless
you mean the IMC been set tertiaries
back to auto quad-channel
IMC is a completely different set of
times for those yeah good call right so
let's go back to auto all the tertiary
timings this is a dual channel CPU X to
99 I guess treated differently being
quad so tertiary I currently have set
all the six and we're gonna go back to
auto on those okay
all right here's hoping it's something
stable so do you RAM timing control
tertiary can I go back to auto auto auto
auto auto okay those are done okay let's
try that this is the hashtag rip LT t
memory KITT yeah so this one did really
well on the quad-channel platform and
again I'm not a memory overclocking
expert so we're in the area where this
is what I like to do with like the with
the overclocking streams I knew I could
hit 23,000 points and I thought I could
maybe hit 24,000 so what I like is
setting a goal that's just outside of my
reach through methods that I know forces
me to try and do things like memory
overclocking so I can learn more about
them because it's my weak spot so like
choose kind of like just outside of
reach goal and then fight for it and
hopefully learn something that's that's
kind of the way I try to do these the
RAM is capable of 4,000 it's done it and
I've only got four a reference builds
Lloyd and others I've only got two
sticks in there right now so I don't
know if the other two might be better
bin than these two but they've all done
4,000 before okay
see so fire strike
get out of here steam windowed mode fire
strike and we're gonna do physics only
it's a click away see if it tries ok
first time running 3 mark in a little
while
kept crashing hopefully it doesn't do it
again we'll see okay so we got some
super chats reminder Douglas earlier
said hockey footy on what you get for
dinner yet we got some other messages
wishbone two dollars flash an overclock
an old Atari Jaguar bill on chawla two
dollars I vote Mexican food
dick Carlson SEK 20 Swedish kronor how
did I read build Zoids comment live from
Sweden yes he's messaging me five
dollars from anathema can you show a
close-up of your fire strike setting so
I can mess with my 8700 K to compare for
like for like it's really simple
I'm opening 3d mark and we're gonna do
it anyway cuz he crashed opening 3d mark
I'm clicking benchmarks and then the
page is white and that's it I don't know
how my teeth reboot after its reboot for
that one yeah that's a reboot for sure
alright
any thoughts build Zoid increasing
voltages it basically just the
application crash so it wasn't a blue
screen this time so that's good
Steve can I sponsor to review my vacuum
cleaner no get half here yeah so the
question on fire strict settings super
easy I open fire strike
I click benchmarks and I click fire
strike not extreme not ultra and then
I'm just the only thing I'm changing
when I do custom run is I'm disabling
all the graphics cores and then this is
the really important thing that you need
to make sure you do it's a dlc feature
actually they started selling so yeah
just disable the graphics settings tests
i mean and then that's it and then
you'll run just a physics test it's a
lot faster if we ran graphics it would
run those first and it wouldn't fail
until like three minutes i well two
minutes and maybe maybe we should change
memory you should just change the memory
modules that are in here builds reuters
typing right now and let him reply try
brand name t RFC up okay and if if it's
still bad we can change memory around z
at 300 or something
let's try 300
let me know if you want a higher build
side all right
so yeah on courthouse I should do encore
haven't done that yet I do that on the
next boot so yeah we're at a five point
three five gigahertz I really want the
last few points super close
super damn close five point three five
gigahertz and the bigger news is one
point three something volts one point
three volts was stable for actually let
me pull up notepad file anyone who's
kind of bounced in and out of the stream
for the last couple hours here's what
our results have been so far score over
here clocks over here so the biggest
item of note five point one gigahertz at
one point three volts that's super good
on a effectively abend 8700 K like
that's it's this part that's impressive
it's the voltage that's impressive
cuz this is like 1.4 Plus on 8700 KS so
anyway let's see if it crashes or
ideally what's not yep
it really doesn't like anything now now
I'm gonna switch memory and just rule
out that variable and see if this is
like see if three he mark needs to be
reinstalled maybe got corrupted or see
if it's just the overclock doing this
it's just an overclock that's easy but
I've had 3d mark corrupts sometimes when
doing a repeatedly you know crashing and
blue screening and stuff like that
alright so I'm restocking the corsair
memory one more stick ok that's in get
into BIOS
okay
got a couple more $5.00 from JG no going
to dinner hashtag ubereats hashtag OC
all night lon
james mccloud five dollars Canadian
thank you
how much hotter you know okay how much
hotter would an NH d15 100% be doing
this test I really do I'm not sure they
the nhd 15 is really close to high on
TLC's I don't think they'd be too
distant but I haven't tested this
specific setup all right so I need to
reset the memory to auto and then XMP
and this is always annoying so we can go
53 or 101 and everything else should
have remained as it was now let's go to
DRAM time control okay so now those
don't look like they reset but whatever
let's just see what happens see if it's
if it doesn't crash this time
build Zoid said maybe do max mem to
improve RAM stability yeah we could do
that I suppose a window setting for that
one
just looking at the store order so I'm
just try and shout out a few more do
these as quickly as I can while it's
booting Devon from Tennessee foil shirt
thank you very much Devon for your
support and picking up a shirt Kristen
from Nevada limited shirt
thank you Tim from New Jersey picked up
a teardown shirt Veon from Texas
our Lian picked up a teardown shirt and
a blue print shirt thank you I think
we're super low on stock on those blue
print ones glad you got one though
refreshing them soon we got an order
from lime Udhas from UK picked up a tear
down shirt a lightweight Raglan hoodie
thank you and a blue print shirt in in
the heather blue color and we're out oh
I think we're out of large on those we
might be out of Excel I think we have a
few mediums so hopefully we can get more
and soon all right so we have the other
kit back in here and I just want to see
will this damn thing stay alive or is
like firestrike corrupted or something
yeah I'm gonna turn off windowed we
really don't need that on at this point
so let's just see if it survives the
first time I'm like over an hour okay
soon from Denmark nice grabbed a Raglan
hoodie that's the two-tone hoodies we
have that we restocked recently and the
teardown shirt thank you very much a
year your cheer from Finland hopefully
one of those is correct
turndown shirt and one of the mouse pads
thank you sir Yakko or Jacko from
Finland man Finland representing tonight
tear down shirt as well got fire strike
physics running by the way super
exciting it's not crashing James from
the US there's a name I can say turn on
shirt and a mousepad thank you James
very much 23 to 8 okay we're in business
it's alive alright so build Zoid if
you're still there if you're not asleep
yet
we have the courser hit back in it's a
thirty two hundred megahertz CL 16 rated
K so I was good as the G scale kit in
theory but maybe we can just get the
last couple hundred points out of this
one since the other one was having
issues so if you have any suggestions
I'm gonna get that dear and timing page
back up 101 BC okay let's push this up
let's try thirty-four megahertz what's
our voltage DRAM voltage is not high
enough let's try like one point point
point Dana one point six there we go
just at 3400 it's the only change I'm
trying to make right now builds I'd let
me know if you got any thoughts
other than maximum they've changed
memory kids okay we got an order from
Luke from Hawaii very nice things about
mod Matt autograph Thank You Luke very
much we appreciate that look forward to
going through and signing a bunch of
them for the next round Alan from us
turn down shirt and a tear down statue
in large Thank You Alan okay we've
booted we've booted we're at 34
megahertz
things are looking good so far
fire strike is no longer just a white
screen can't get much better than that
no no okay run alright see what we do I
check some of the chat for a bit
5.3 gigahertz so far he's trying to OC
memory now yes we're at five point three
five five point three five is where we
are right now that desktop makes me die
inside yeah well no test machines all
day
see if you still care all right
it's running hasn't died yet
see I think you need to drink some water
before your voice fails you later I just
just take some we're good thank you for
your concern
okay 23 jisung 1a it worked all right
nice it's got the timings going now
course sir coming through was a kit that
I thought would be the not the best kit
today we've got that 4600 Hertz kit
maybe I should run that with um with
just lower frequency actually just in
case Andrew can you ask if Patrick's
still here
I can you ask them to hand you the 46
hundred megahertz kit yeah
Corsair kit or just the whole tray
okay guys so we're slowly creeping up on
everything here just tightening timings
kind of one at a time
got the frequency boosted things are
looking good we might get that we might
get what what we're going for here 24k
points what size aao to 80
actually to 80 millimeters is next sixty
to maxed out imagine doing this - to
solid state used to take ages yeah I
know that I fortunately never really had
to do that I don't know let's let's pick
this up someone sets on their honor
mention Alex temple and chat as this
video shows it can get very high clocks
at low voltage yes
as I've said multiple times it's
expensive but it's an enthusiast part
the fact that he's he thinks it's
marketing exclusively shows he doesn't
know what he's on about I'm guessing
that's talked about someone else in chat
because I haven't actually said those
words and so I'm assuming that's the
point replying someone else but I don't
know okay
and pill joint says that spawn when
clean the memory kit makes it clock
higher yeah like if it's dirty dirty
contacts okay Andrew is seeking out the
4000 megahertz kit which we would run at
just lower lower frequency I think it
would let me get away with tighter
timings though what temperature and
clock monitoring Tyler is he using
I like hardware info 64 how big is the
industrial chiller using you know what
that's an Intel thing it harder in 464
is great free super good can you explain
some of the timing settings yes we have
a video on a lot of them or make it
we're actually researching right now for
the secondary on the tertiary video are
using the hero X motherboard yes they're
used to new BIOS I don't if they're easy
yesterday I don't have it I have the one
from like before that fire strikes
running guys surviving
- ice in the reservoir it's not gonna
help me right now 23400 get in there oh
man
only 600 points now okay
that's exciting looking forward to this
okay we got some comments $5.00 from
Filth e casual is it necessary to seal
Wendy lady in for liquid metal and
installing an upright case no it is not
socket the socket the CPU into the
motherboard when it's flat and it's not
gonna move don't worry about it at all
yes Patrick out yeah yeah that's
understandable
being that it's nine o'clock okay guys
you got a memory delivery it's gonna be
one of these yeah thanks
so this is so far still working I'm
gonna keep pushing this one we got up -
while you're in the other room
23400 it's actually getting pretty close
now
okay let's try that see how many points
we can get out of that I think builds or
is caught talking about contact cleaners
but the sentence yeah I used alcohol out
of context is probably accurate to how
most people feel about over-talking
memory just realize I need to push the
cash ratio so I don't know it should do
50 but do 48
okay try that see how that does for us
filthy casual I got that question our
annex bike $5.00 I vote Italian if it
maybe sausage raviolis in alfredo sauce
sounds like you know what you want for
dinner
that sounds pretty specific tomfoolery
$2.00 I've got a kid on the way g n1z
when it's Janna onesie okay so I change
the cash ratio finally I tighten the tie
means 2:15 I was answering toner earlier
about what the timings mean we have
video on the channel it's somewhat
recent it's in the last week or two on
the primary timings check that out we've
got some even results on secondary
timings and working on the tertiary and
secondary timing videos over the next
week or two so maybe it'll run let's see
doing pretty well
Strother by it says adult gn1 z1 and
Sergeant Zeta says get that man some
ravioli
Chat Chat is on point today okay so
while that's going on let me take a
couple more of these store orders thank
you again Tyler from us a tear down
shirt and a mod map thank you very much
Tyler we're so happy to see those mod
mats going out we really like the
product I'm super proud of it use it
every day and I'm glad to see that
people are getting to try it out and
also Gerald from the US bought a tear
down shirt okay twenty three four one
seven okay so it's not crashing 600 down
points hmm-hmm-hmm let's tighten the
time in some more and let's try and
increase the frequency to one at a time
I think we're still at 101 BC okay GPS
shouldn't be bottlenecking us cuz it's
just a physics test so it's basically
100% CPU load I could do per core
overclocking and try to push some of the
cores higher but that sounds like a
recipe for taking a lot longer
24:34 let's go to 35 35 and now let me
boot with 28 why not let's see
finally it does feel good to finally
stop crashing a blue screen looking
forward to the 24k Don from Australia
picked up a tear down shirt Thank You
Don going a long way for that one happy
to ship it out there Ian from the US a
lightweight Raglan hoodie stickers and
decals and the GN blue and white
microfiber cloth mousepad two of them
thank you very much sir your again as I
said earlier one of the first few who's
picked those up we've been working we've
been working on that mousepad since we
got the sample and it's still looking
good tracks fine so I'm happy with it
alright let's see how this does
yeah that's the trick with fire strike
convert 24k 24k it's finally making
progress
someone says just turn everything up to
11 if only it were that easy someone's
asking if it's deleted yes it is deleted
and it's got liquid metal on it's got
thermal grisly conduct not that oh that
looked like a crash but it was a loading
screen conductor not on there
yeah thermal is great right now for I
mean for what it's doing 5.3 plus
gigahertz
sergeant Zeta 2 bucks comfy pajama pants
with GN logos all over when Andrew when
are we gonna we gonna get get design in
that one she hadn't pajama pants wait
it's all of a foot yeah good question
they go everywhere
according to Zeta 20 teeth okay so we're
not really improving at this point let's
switch me I mean this kids doing well so
I don't really want to switch it but
yeah yeah let's keep let's keep with
this kit you know I have a better one in
front of me this one's doing well so I'm
just gonna push the frequency until it
fails
okay how reliable is delayed KITT odds
of killing CPU pretty damn reliable I've
never had issues there is inherent risk
there's more risk with the rise in AP
use than there is with the Intel CP is
because the rise in AP is have small
service mount devices SMDs under the IHS
as oppose Intel doesn't have that many
and they're mostly on the underside of
the substrate so that kind of goes into
a hole so they're not at brilliant risk
there's always inherent risk but by like
rocket cool or dare Bauer deal it die
mate either one of those they're they're
pretty damn good at keeping it safe I've
never had a problem with either one
just be careful make sure you use it
correctly that's the big thing that's
take your time with it you know don't
don't rush for no good reason
okay yeah let's push the mesh up alright
I called match cache 50 see how we do
with 50 and 3600 one of those might
cause a crash cloud bigs GN toolkit
would be cool and that would be cool
Gary wolf plus one on the 1z suggestion
I too have a forthcoming child the unit
you have until mid-october or else
grimmy to Buxton a diem new at NOC tool
fans fan reviews when heart you fam
knocked to offends yes so finally got
some progress on the fan fest and stuff
but there's a lot going on
no ETA right now something I'm still
kind of working on I might have to send
out some of our fantastic stuff to an
engineer friend of mine for some
troubleshooting help because one of the
one of the custom PCBs isn't doing
exactly what I want it to so if we can
figure that out then we'll be ready to
go but that's the holdup right now five
bucks Aaron plus 100 PJ's do it it'd be
cool
all right
reading some of the other comments
Maude Matt onesie mesh underwear sounds
pretty nice actually ice put ice in the
water
hashtag GNP J is build a mouse mat
that's something we're looking at
actually seen a lot of out of stock
items in the store I yeah sorry I don't
know if there are a lot of orders today
we just got like actually may ask our
distributor we just got a bunch of the
blue tear downs shirts in like the this
shirt except the older blue 122 for 5c
damn so close what do I have to do for
those last few points I think I need to
push the CPU higher I like the cord
mighty yeah I might need to do that I
don't know how much memory is gonna get
us I don't do some more memory timing
stuff and see how it does
black stickers please I have a white car
I put them on the on the window it's the
only where I put mine if you want a
bumper sticker but we can definitely
look into black stickers it wouldn't be
hard to make them I could certainly do
that thank you for the suggestion
okay DRAM timing so let's see if this
can get us anything builds Roy did you
raise the uncork locket yes I raised it
to fifty tear ass 28 is the lowest
possible for coffee like running fire
struck twice and boost Gore's you can
also bump PCL K by a few decimals let's
try all those things build Zoid here our
settings is 1515 28 that's the lowest we
can do he's saying what did you want
this out earlier like 220 or something
let's try that and okay there's that
let's boost PCL K if we can to like
101.5 that might push a failure to 40 is
what he wanted on that
oops I did T 20 how about a desk fan
that says Gianna it spins
you know there was a that where to go
you know there's anti-static wrist
straps it might make sense to sell some
with GN print encore encore encore yeah
it's at 50 you see okay just messing
with multiplayer yeah
I'm just reading some of the chat
messages reading all the suggestions on
overclocking it might be kind of stuck I
don't know so I think what I'm gonna do
is 51 encore see what that does
go go go go I think it did not like the
101.5 let's do 100 what if we push for a
higher voltage we have the thermal
Headroom let's try that let's try that
with 101.5 assuming it wasn't the memory
that caused the crash oh and ER FC
changed it to 40 from t 20 to 40 okay
and uncor it's kind of breaking the rule
changing a whole bunch of stuff at once
uncor it's 51 okay let's try that
are we on 1t I thought I was onto T I
need to double-check
I switched memory kits that might be
okay so see if it even turns on Felix
from Berlin a limited edition foil shirt
thank you very much Felix looks like it
booted so far yes Jeffrey from Texas
pick the bass shirt thank you very much
Jeff for you from Texas a lot of people
from Texas tonight actually
New York Philip picked up a mod Matt
Thank You Philip
it'll be out there within the next
couple weeks we're getting them in very
soon finally this one this run was a bit
delayed due to a holiday Joseph from the
US Oklahoma picked up a shirt okay let's
run fire strike
see if it does if it's 22400 again I'm
gonna be out of ideas
other than pushing the core higher okay
so it crashed last time I was setting
similar to these I just increased the
voltage a bit and it's gonna run the
physics Zecharia from the US picked up a
mod map thank you very much from Ohio
Austin from California picked up a shirt
I kick it that was a black loading
screen I thought it was a crash it might
go down Nikolas from New York picked up
a shirt and a keychain Thank You
Nicholas Roberts from Bayern Bavaria
Germany picked up a t-shirt and a G on a
blue print shirt and the Heather
material all right so what is it gonna
do 23 7:45 it's so close we actually
made real progress here guys so that's
plus 300 or so points finally making
moves or stuck out 23400 forever
I want 24,000 for like 200 away Dan okay
get them there I probably should have
run that a second time I have 1024
so so damn close we're fine if it's good
it's good like to finally not get stuck
anymore with boot failures took a while
thank you for bearing with us those of
you who are still here all I did was
increase the voltage what was build
annoyed I think it's builds I'd shirt on
historic eat common or his be core or
something
it's basically what we're doing right
now okay so what am I gonna do
frequency let's try frequency there I'm
gonna hit a blue screen at some point
build Zoid any thoughts if you're
handing out still pin them to me on
discord please we're pretty damn close
thirty-three twenty three thousand seven
forty five was the score looks like it's
failing the boot with thirty seven
hundreds memory so we'll go back down to
your 36 and find something else to tune
can swap in the forty six hundred
megahertz of course I remember E or if
memories not gonna help can try and push
frequent the ratio higher I guess we can
push 454
just as more more vcore order from
Carlos from the US picked up a shirt
Thank You Carlos
okay 53i
this is what caused it to fail just now
let's go down a tick let's try this
let's try 54 I think it's gonna crash
I'm gonna push more voltage because it's
within thermal tolerance so whatever and
it's just for benchmarking wouldn't
recommend these voltages for 24/7 use at
all okay what are the chances of frying
this chip and I should be fine
what are the VRM temps looking like
these kinds of voltages ah good question
I mean it's only running for like 30
seconds at a time and as long as to
under like 120 degrees Celsius it's fine
so this board is pretty built out I
think builds I did a video on this one
maybe might be on our channel actually
I'm not sure well it's pretty built up
motherboard big vrm so it's fine it has
kind of a bad heatsink but it's only
running again 30 seconds at a time what
did I just change I went to 52 so it did
not like 52 I'm gonna try more voltage
and I might put a fan on the Viera but
it seems fine
let me try II try higher B CLK drop
multiplier and higher mash we can try
that
that might work let's try that approach
so let's try 102 BC okay
let's try 52 multiplier which will put
our frequency at 50 what do i do 53 what
is that 53 would be 5,400 short 52 for
you TLB bit lower and let's try the
higher mash 52 and let's see if that
boots I don't know if that'll be a lower
score it's 50 megahertz slower
technically but everything else is
faster all right we're trying
we got a couple super chats Alex five
bucks my count was in reference to
someone else oh yeah yeah figured also
any reason you don't do more open-loop
content too time-consuming not have
interest space I don't have enough space
we're kind of maxed out on our benches
open loops take a lot of space cleaning
them takes a lot of space so we do it
but ya need a bit more space which we're
working on that looks like a no-go I'm
gonna leave it alone for a second but it
looks like it's not gonna work Marko
five bucks
loaded edition foil GN logo protection
they'll fly off the shelves that button
not work
okay safe boot once again man so this is
overclocking guys this is what it is
when you get stuck so it's so damn close
dude where are you at
I took an hour and a half of nap and
came back you're still goin welcome back
we are at fifty three fifty megahertz on
the cpu we're at twenty three thousand
seven hundred and forty five points on
the fire strike physics core I want 24k
and I think that brings you up to speed
memory has been a big thing for us I'm
actually considering yeah I'm gonna swap
the memory right now just why not we are
kind of hitting a core limitation but
maybe a bit more frequency would help I
think we're gonna be limited on the IMC
been to some point some extent though
thirty two hundred that's not what I
want
whereas my insane kit 4600 can we show
this label just to let everyone know
what we're working with right now we're
not gonna run this at 4600 for a number
of reasons so it's really small but on
that label you'll see 4600 see 19 19 26
26 46 those are some timings I'm gonna
run this lower like way lower and hope
that the chip quality which is
guaranteed on these is enough that I can
run tight timings with a lower frequency
rather than the high frequency I'm loose
diamonds
okay there we go I want this want this
damn score okay
so that's that core circuit we've talked
about it before huh manual reverse
offset four volts which is better that's
a great question
offsets really good if you want to keep
some of the power saving features
because what offset does is if you tell
it to offset by X 0.1 then whenever it's
doing something the CPU will still pull
whatever amount of voltage it thinks is
appropriate for that task and offset it
by 0.1 as opposed to a manual override
we're just always poles whatever you
type in so if you're like actually using
it daily offset makes a lot of sense
because it will consume less power and
you'll get the same end effect it's just
sometimes it's a bit less stable so
that's the trouble with it I leave all
these alone so we're gonna try 15 even
it's a CL 19 kit we're just not gonna
write that yeah we're gonna run it here
where it was and was it unstable with
this it might have been unstable because
the CPU settings I'll check in a minute
I think BC LK might be unstable on this
one yeah we're at 5.3 5 gigahertz we're
just swapping memory see what we can do
are you going to restock GM load with
key chains are they out of stock if they
are the answer is yes we have a lot of
them actually coming in right now
they're in production so they'll be here
within probably three weeks or so we're
gonna have a whole bunch of them in
stock I'll make sure that everyone know
in a news video or something like that
we're restocking a lot of stuff right
now we sold out of tons of stuff in the
stream
now interesting someone says there's a
known bug be carefully using hardware
info 64 that board to look at your vrm
temperatures doing so it can result in
the bsod I didn't know that but we
haven't been using it for the last year
on so so that's kind of good and bad the
bad is that I don't have an easy
scapegoat alright we're going to drop
the BC LK see the good news here
although this kind of sucks at this
point but it's getting there
good news is that I have clear courses
of action so not totally lost so that's
where you want to be 101.5 and let's
drop this back down to 51 okay try that
okay a couple more Super chats easier
five bucks great now I want a chant one
ze2 and some pajamas pajamas
two dollars from Douglas seems like GN
PJ's are in demand
hahaha you do a Geekbench run on this
thing I don't have it installed I don't
think my me hi Steve 350 - wishbone gave
to us thoughts on Google Yeti console
next-gen or 2025 plus I have no idea
what that is do you know what Google
Yeti is I'm sorry I don't know but I'm
gonna look it up on the stream ends
because I haven't heard of that
there's a lot of Technology every day I
can't can't keep up with it all okay it
food it that's good
all right so ten bucks from David Oh
what does CPU cache ratio actually do
CBO cash ratio so that's like uncorks
everything but the core so that's going
to affect like the interconnects and
stuff like that how fast things can
communicate you have mesh ratios on the
i9 CPUs that are interesting to
overclock as well same reason david 10
bucks question about my 68 50k do you
think 4.5 gigahertz 1.38 5 is too much
honestly I don't remember the 6850 k's
safe voltages imc isn't great because I
can't push uncor past 3.2 is this the
case of the most broad well eat chips I
I wish I had a good answer for you I can
really only like remember the last two
generations or so that's pretty close
but we never worked on the 68 50k it was
a I was buying all my own Intel chips at
that point I still buy a lot of them and
that one at the time it came out it was
too expensive for us so unfortunately I
don't have hands-on experience at that
one overclocked net and overclockers
forums are really good places they have
complete guides if you ever need an OC
guide you have a question what's the
safe hole that you my CPU lookup the CPU
and an overclocked guide and there are
really good forum posts with people who
do that stuff all the time is it gonna
work maybe once it starts running it's
typically okay $2.00 from servant XFX SF
to help with getting more space check
this card I will do that I'm Way behind
on discord messages I see a lot of them
five bucks from Eric who said I wish I
had money for right now for a foil
anniversary sure it looks great thank
you
hope you do something someone again we
will for sure yeah that's a downgrade
okay so why what did I change
oh the ratio is down that's right the
core ratio I reduced when I increase BC
okay which we just reduced and I didn't
increase the core issue Oh try and wrap
this up at some point eventually I guess
okay surprised you guys can do this
without music I mean as much as I'd love
to listen to music right now I also
don't want to be demonetized so kind of
live your life based around that okay 53
let's go that does that we'll pick it
back up a bit
Alan from California purchased a
teardown shirt Thank You Alan Joanna
from New Jersey picked up a teardown
shirt thank you very much and Allison
from New York picked up a teardown shirt
as well
gara taxes how can you explain well the
turbo boost power time window and XTU is
my understanding and I would need to
open X to you to look at the exact
setting the time window is for turbo
boost I think have to do with how
quickly it will boost or exit boost and
how long it'll hold that boost is useful
for like the hideous Canyon knocked over
clock in for example I think that's I
think that's what it is
I'd have to open it and look
hashtag please puck that's an old one
you can listen the stock music yeah
great thanks a lot
can't wait to listen to like elevator
music song 3 and it's a very successful
sequel elevator music song for I can
listen to some toughie what's that guy
his name is like all over YouTube high
chemically odd or whatever his name is
you thought I didn't know whatever
listen saw his music so he is pretty
good technically had for four straight
hours it might be a bit much this is a
good I got two bucks from sweaty small
snack GN shirt Dan twenty three five
four three okay at least it's going up
gym shirt and white please we could
probably do that twenty three five four
three we're going back up
five bucks from sinful Griff if you
didn't have to worry about what you want
if you didn't have to worry about being
demonetised who would you be jamming to
right now
maybe Parkway driver trivia I've been
listening to in flames lately
emergency stuff from the 90s for them
it's old Swedish band I mean old by
nature of like metalcore they're pretty
old all right so that that got us
somewhere I made progress let's do more
on the frequency here see if the CPU IMC
can handle it maybe try fourteen one of
those that's probably gonna fail but
let's give a shot what socket type is
the i7 series you or OC now I ll g xi v
you want anything
so one says great taste I'm going to see
Trivium on July 23rd VIP tickets nice
what are your expectations on 9000 CCP
is worth it or another disappointment uh
not sure I don't know really anything
official about it or unofficial I don't
really follow week so you probably have
seen more than I have Dan okay so that
was the memory
in flames brings me back to my high
school they say they've been around a
while cloud-connected in flames a lot of
people liking the flame is burning in
flames Parkway Drive trivia used to
listen to a lot of made in still do
occasionally where did I was at 36:54 oh
I also did the I did a lot of things at
once so let's leave the frequency where
it is and let's bring this back up to 15
and see what that does
I saw it in flames years ago with the
faceless 3 inches of blood and Between
the Buried and Me BT BAM is good
protests the hero is really good too
Iyer yeah I was really good album okay
so it might boot all I did was go back
up on the time it's 15 Dan yeah new it
inflames is pretty bad someone says I
haven't listened to any new in flames
their founder left in like 2010 so I
would imagine since then they've changed
style a lot alright so we're gonna go
back down on something or up on the
voltage or something like that let's do
this point eight try that more voltage
I don't have much experience the intel
has to deal with AMD is Intel cash ratio
similar to hypertransport you kind of
think of it that way yeah be CLK well
yeah we're like infinity fabric or
something to that extent I guess kind of
it Suncor Google's Project Yeti is an
Ouya for cloud game streaming don't know
what I think of that game stream is kind
of the future of service providers I
think at some point 1.8 volts isn't that
too high no because that was DRAM DRAM
can take it it's a question of whether
the IMC can take it it probably can't
for a long period of time the DRAM can
totally take 1.8 1.5 we've done IMC will
not like it for long-term use but we're
just doing an overclocked session so it
really doesn't matter man yeah I think
we're kinda at the limit here is not
like you know anything at this point so
where's our score 23 745 hmm I don't
think any GPU stuff is gonna help me
what else can I even try we can go back
up on the frequency here and then we can
do
let's try 14 14 again
all right five bucks from hardcore Jason
Danvers Nexus where Tech and metal he
Knight Texas represent okay there we go
booted no it helps overclocking double
bass which Ram slots are using reusing
the ones you should be two and four
do you know when be 450 motherboards are
launching no okay what what do I need to
do at this point what is it on behalf I
guess I'm having about that 14 15 15 and
I think cash ratio 52 it's try that
that's not really gonna do a whole lot
her core let's try this see if that
doesn't anything that might be a that's
that's probably bit aggressive actually
because what does that calculate a to so
if I do
54 calculates out to 54 81 with the
101.5 so let's see 101 and 53 puts us at
yeah so quickly for puts us at what 54
okay so I'm gonna try 100 and I'm going
to try per core and I'ma do 55 no no 54
54 it's a 350 to beat 53 let's try that
so so the CP is actually doing fine
it was the RAM I was having trouble with
I think the CPU is just kind of at its
limit here which is like 50 350
megahertz apparently David five bucks an
ad and hi Steve would you recommend
replacing r9 390 with Vega sixty-four
should I hold off until Navi
I don't know when Navi is going to come
up so same thing I said earlier where if
you are happy with your current system
then keep using it and if you have
points where you like you know that you
have noticeable things you could improve
with a different GPU then just upgrade
now because I now is not around the
horizon immediately if you want AMD
there's no immediate timeline for it
which means it's a little while out
I wouldn't recommend necessarily Vega 64
I like making 56 a lot and it can more
or less become Vega 64 especially if
you're willing to flash BIOS on it and
apply an overclock like it's within
single digit percentages of Vega 64 so I
like that card 56 I like a lot 64 I
never particularly liked at the price
and he kind of killed their own value
yeah I don't know this is uh this is
more or less done I think
to quote to quote kingpin from combi Tex
when he was working on Robo clocker with
the Titan V and I'd been pushing it for
seven straight hours under L&amp;amp;T all day
like running around trying to get a fire
strike score and he was just having
trouble with stability just like we are
here and he was good she's done ski
Steve she's done ski I think she's done
Steve kind of said kept saying it he got
to work though every time he said his
system was was done he got it to clock
up some more we have a video of that we
have a video of the I think I called it
like 5.7 gigahertz overclockers
something memory problem yeah we have
one with with kingpin in it with Mia was
pretty fun though okay apparently a
memory problem wasn't catastrophic
no we're not done
all right so it's running
ten man down great again I don't have a
ton of ideas here this memory is really
good so I don't maybe the IMC might be a
bit limited on the CPU that's where we
get into talking about bending the cores
and the IMC you can only do so much with
what you have
so don't know I've got memory timings to
where I'm pretty happy with them as far
as I know timings by 100 that was at 54
54 okay so maybe that was pushing it a
bit let's just do one point like yeah
sure I'll see 1.5 volts let's do it
don't know if we have a thermal head
room but feels like we are can you pass
me one of those noctua fans right there
either one thanks so I'm just gonna plug
this fan and then stick it on top of the
socket where the vrm is just in case
that's getting issues at this point
because we are demanding a lot of it at
1.5 volts now
I'm just gonna try and sit this kinda on
top of it somewhere there we go
just sitting right on top of the CLC
tubes
so that will help the vrm at least might
cool down the socket marginally my fire
strikes dead
come on
like how fire strike just says dot dot
dot when it can't launch veteran from
Texas picked up a shirt Thank You
Benjamin
Collin from us picked up a shirt as well
Eduardo from California picked up a
shirt and a blue print shirt and the
heather material thank you sir
andrew from arizona picked up a limp
teardown shirt okay let's go back over
here fire strike we're at 1.5 now we
have two cores at fifty four fool man we
have the rest at 53 yeah this is looking
like again the quote can been that it's
done ski
what you say for Vega 56 and 64 would
you say the same 164 is only 7% more I
mean I don't know if it's $20 price
difference I guess maybe 64 I like 56
more but if they're about the same price
the thing that is the performance isn't
really there but like even the matter
20 bucks maybe I might do it you can
tend to overclock with these sticks a
bit higher in frequency because there's
less thermal density after core straight
out but yeah other than that I guess
maybe it's worth 20 bucks or something
not worth 100 though okay I think I
would to do like I got a limited at this
point because we're not making a ton of
progress so let's see I think this
memory is good no point changing that I
am see might not be great so I think
what we're gonna do is back down on the
per cores or changed which chords on
like maybe the 54 on just one of them
and that's just not gonna get us a ton
though
and you probably come down on this a bit
we can go up on s you know si is not
really gonna help us at this point
frequency that can go up maybe 3700 and
that's not really worth it either I'm
looking for stuff to get us like
hundreds of points gains I think we're
gonna be under because we've lowered BC
okay so there we go that'll up that
three I'm gonna try I try 101 54 on a
single core and see what that does
okay
someone says I'm on my second date he
said I okay the first one last in three
days why builds Lloyd suggested running
back-to-back without changes I've done
it the problem is it has to complete the
test and right now it's just crashing so
we were successful for a while but I've
gotten more aggressive with it because
I'm really really trying to close this
out so it's not like in that 54
multiplier so I'm gonna drop that back
to 53 and I think we're gonna stop
touching the multiplier at that point
that's gonna be it
that's just be CLK and memory which I
can't do a lot more with so 53 11.5 okay
okay
all right try that
two bucks from Irish giant what IceCube
are you using none right now tacos for
dinner 442 from a blink and the hue Abe
Lincoln good to have you here I've heard
about you Bruce Lane five bucks
greetings right Lana put in an order for
a foil shirt and can't wait keep up the
awesome work and good luck thank you
very much Bruce for your support okay it
booted
will it survive or is firestrike just
like gone
this happens sometimes fire strike alike
corrupt itself sometimes it comes back
sometimes it needs a reinstall yeah no I
think that's it I can't can't push it
any farther and we're at you know let's
final thing go back to the settings
where I got twenty three seven four five
if they're even still stable as a
different Ram now and run two
consecutive runs and if that doesn't do
it then that's that's gonna be it for
the stream until I have another idea for
how to improve it later and we got to
bring out the Titan view anyway so it's
good to have around - ok so I don't
remember what exact setting Scott just
there previously but I'm gonna drop Nash
or whatever it's called on this platform
uncor 251 we're gonna drop this back to
one point four seven which is
unnecessarily high as well and the
memory should be fine
might need to go 101 on B CLK 53 rz3
yeah let's do that
101 on BC okay and let's give that a
shot that should at least maybe pass
Gerald from Florida picked up a teardown
drew thank you sir Marco from
Switzerland pick the best shirt as well
Thank You Marco Christopher from the US
grabbed a keychain and shirt Mario from
Florida picked up a shirt as well it's
gonna ask me to do a restart on this I
think yep okay so restart pc matthew
picked up a mod matt autographs Thank
You Matthew for grabbing that excited to
get those out and a shirt as well
Mikal from France picked up a shirt
autograph mod mat and shirt for
Sebastian in the u.s. Thank You
Sebastian okay it booted here we go see
see if we can do it
see if three mark even loads might be
dead it's giving me more than dot dot
dot this time at least
is it gonna blue screen as Windows
screwed up like what's going on Dan
no.3 mark might need to reinstall which
I don't really feel like doing right now
yeah okay so I don't know I think we're
stuck think think we gotta call it at
23:00 7:45 everyone remember that I'll
come back and we'll beat it
and our whenever our next stream is so a
couple things mmm really happy with the
stream overall we're stuck at 23:00 7:45
super close to the goal pretty happy
with it I will come back and see what we
can do in the future for another one of
these these are OC streams are a lot of
fun just put a titan feedback underwater
block so I have plans for that once I'm
back I'm gonna be in in Vancouver for
Linus's then LTX this weekend so we're
still getting work done but I'll be up
there probably do a couple videos with
some of the youtubers up there so keep
an eye out for those subscribe of course
and what else is going on we have
content on the pipe surrounding the 8086
Kay tomorrow we'll have a volt frequency
content piece which actually I didn't go
as far as here so we probably recap this
- but big takeaway here again is that at
a given frequency you can run a lower
voltage which is lower heat and power so
we were at like one point three four
five point one gigahertz which is crazy
good and that's just because it's a bend
8700 K so that's what that comes down to
really good chip that performs well up
until 53 50 megahertz and I'm just stuck
and I don't know I don't know what to do
at that point onward so let me read the
last couple chats and things had five
bucks from David hit that 24k and get
some KFC - you like KFC this point I
like any kind of food at all Carl Dennis
and we will get that 24 K in the next
game gives us something to come back for
Carl dentists 10 bucks thanks for the
awesome live stream keep doing what you
all do thank you for the support Carl
and for enjoying and watching the stream
GNP J is hashtag haha shout out is it
sergeant's a shout out to the best
cameraman and 3d modeler Andrew
something that got bend by Intel that's
relatively disappointing I did okay I
guess
can't really that I expect a bike check
on your G on steep channel I can do that
for sure if the cat is present 24 K will
be possible yeah probably how many
unread story emails so I have I don't
know like I can try and shout out
everyone with store purchases there are
a lot of them it'll take a while let me
go through a few I tried do these
quickly so Cody from Pennsylvania picked
up a shirt and Sean from us got a shirt
by the way guys for the next streams
make sure you subscribe and keep an eye
on our Twitter page Twitter commerce
taxes so that's where I will announce
them will try it announced in the news
videos as well this was really fun
streaming we'll definitely do more of
them
subscribe see and catch them I don't
know if I'll stream while I'm at LTX at
all but I'm planning to do like an
on-stage Q&amp;amp;A with Linus where it'll be
fun we'll have like two opposing or
different viewpoints on something so I
think that'll be a lot of fun to talk
about like for example we can provide
the viewpoint of a large you know like
obviously very successful outlet and a
smaller outlet with two different types
of content how we approach things like
YouTube being a problem and how YouTube
changes and stuff like that so that'll
be a lot of fun but anyway I subscribe
if you're not I want to read through
some of these orders now and we'll have
another live stream where I try and hit
24k somewhat soon the next couple weeks
but otherwise thank you very much for
watching if you're gonna tune out I get
it let me read a few of these and well
we'll close out officially so Daniel
from us picked up a shirt so Thank You
Daniel
we got man that was a Mustaine's by Matt
o Grimes I know you from Georgia picked
up a shirt Thank You Grimes
Marc from the US picked up a shirt as
well let me just let me simplify this
it's not a shirt I'll specify Tyler from
Pennsylvania thank you very much for
your purchase on the store Chris from
Florida grabs a couple of things
justin from us grab the shirt Tommy from
Texas picked up a mod Matt thank you
very much Tommy love to see in those
sails cuz they're big can they take a
lot of space or proud of them
why don't we get used but also they take
up a lot of space William take the best
shirts I said I would cut that phrasing
prism from us picked up decals tear down
crystal for Michael in the u.s. there
are a lot more of these but I can do it
I can do it quickly the next five
minutes Jacob from Virginia was just
there not long ago picked off a shirt as
well
Jeffrey from the US thank you sir for
your store purchase and supporting us
during this very long stream William us
picked up a keychain and shirt
we got Sean us picked up a shirt as well
making a Denton though all right I'm
gonna check chat for a second for
however many of you are still here
okay so cut any questions recapping we
did 50 350 megahertz or thereabouts on
the CPU that's what we had it running at
with memory at 36 something 101.5 be CLK
and then we got stuck jacob picked up a
shirt as well a lot of us orders today
nora from yes thank you
Priscilla from the US picked up a
keychain and a shirt thank you very much
Brian from us picked up a keychain I
believe that was shirt for Brandon in
Kentucky nice we're almost through and
thank you very much for the support
Hollis this was this was an insane live
Street last forever lots of fun Jason
from us picked up shirt and who else we
got you have the back button worked on
this mouse would be nice
Stefan from Germany picked up a couple
of shirts will be in Germany at some
point games come limited-edition shirts
to Jose and chilly I think that might be
one of the first chilly orders I've seen
Allen us picked up a graph logo shirt
those are almost out of stock now Austin
from the US grab the shirt couple more I
think it's like maybe 15 Ryan from
Colorado grabbed the shirt Ryan also
from Massachusetts grabbed one thank you
Sami from Finland just reading all this
the store purchases from the stream guys
thank you for your patience Michael from
Ohio grab the shirt got about 10 or some
more ray u.s. grabbed one Peter from
Canada Robert from Kentucky thank you
all of you guys Jeremy us picked up a

Alexander us Thank You Jacob Australia
feel like I should just say every name
possible this point cover all Omar from
Queens New York grabbed a couple of
shirts okay we've got five left see the
end Adrienne from Ireland
nice picked up a mousepad a graph logo
shirt and a limited edition shirt for
more Michael from Plymouth us picked up
a mod mat and a shirt we got Nicola from
us grab the shirt and Gregory us lots of
us orders lightweight hoodie I guess
probably everyone else is asleep right
now us for rob for a limited edition
sure ok that's it any more orders
we got small if it was in there cool
okay so last few things in chat here
just to catch up see if you got lots of
folks watching you out here in Alaska
bro that's awesome I didn't know we had
an audience out there I'm glad to hear
it
glad to hear we can we can provide some
value to you all so a couple things I
saw some questions here do you have a
full cover block on CPU and the V arm no
I had a fan on top of the VR I'm at the
very end but it was actually not a
problem and yeah so it was fine but no I
didn't have a full block on it was your
relationship with the with ZOTAC over
the 980 extreme review I will never
forget that video yes so they haven't
sent us anything since then I got a 1080
CIF extreme from a viewer reviewed it
didn't do it was not well designed
thermally sent them that link and that
was last time I worked with that or
talked to them actually how it worked to
them since the 980ti extreme review last
couple things from super chat to our
Cyrus giant what cameraman and three
modeler are you ice cubing too many
memes Eric Jackson $5 awesome stream
he's definitely take a lot of effort
I've seen a stressful at home hold on
haha maybe a maybe some spare SSDs with
the fresh windows and saw it next time
yeah probably
that'd be good just you know just in
case we have a Windows death I don't
know if windows got screwy here or not
alright so that's it guys thank you so
much for watching it was crazy long hyah
stream August we've ever done 50 350
megahertz anyone skipping to the end
looking for a summary that's it that's
what we hit 50 350 megahertz ram was
okay everything else I'll do a recap
video probably so yeah thank you for
watching subscribe for more store doc
gamers Nexus dotnet remember this shirt
okay last warning as it said of the
whole time this will not be available
ever anymore after this stream ends I'm
going to give it like 10 minutes after
the stream ends you get your order in
you'll get one
after that 10-minute window that's it we
won't allow or like you will not be able
to place an order they'll be gone like
it's a limited edition for a reason so
close unit at the end of the stream
thank you so much to all of you who
picked one up
you look forward to sending them out to
you but we are keeping it limited so
closing it out in about 10 minutes get
your orders in there you were watching
subscribe for more I'll see you all next
