first 1080 aiv partner cards we've
received after the founders edition or
reference card as we are trying to
revert to calling it now so this is the
gaming X this is the middle of MSI stack
above this is the gaming Z and then
they've got some cards below it as well
so this is the middle it is priced at
720 dollars which puts it above the
founders edition cards which are $700
and above several of the other competing
cards including semi referenced cards
from MSI that are priced in the six
hundred dollar range so this is pretty
high up there in terms of price but
we're here to review it today test the
performance thermals noise overclocking
all that stuff and see how it does the
GT X 1080 gaming X operates at three
different clock rates our review model
shipped at a stock clock rate of 1847
megahertz which falls under Emma size OC
mode you might need to install the MSI
software to toggle these modes and see
comparable results but basically there's
a step-down mode which is gaming mode at
1822 megahertz boosted and then silent
mode at 17 33 megahertz boosted which
runs a lower fan speed now there was
some discussion over the last few days
about Asus and MSI cards shipping at
these highest OC settings that they have
and potentially having custom v bios for
reviewers i'm not 100% sure if that was
the case here i do know for 100% certain
that I did ship at that OC mode sort of
preset clock rate but that's something
you could do as well so I'm not going to
not going to go on a rant about that
because there's no need to you can
basically install the a the the suite
for MSI's cards and then set it to OC
mode and you'll have the same clock rate
that we have on this thing for our tests
here so the gaming X has an extra 6 pin
power header and that puts it up to a
total power allowance of 300 watts if
you can actually hit that with the V
bios limitations the voltage or voltage
limitations and in terms of V bios we
were told by MSI
detects that these cards have a custom v
bios with additional over-voltage we'll
test that in the overclocking section
but it should have a custom v bios and
then the card itself is very obviously a
non reference PCB because it's it's
quite large so this part right here the
expansion slot is exceeded in height by
the actual PCB and the cooler and this
is something that just as a brief aside
does really annoy me with these cards
because they are unnecessarily tall and
it's kind of annoying to work with SLI
configurations or just install and some
systems it will not work in a lot of
Mini ITX
cases as a result and the height is
really just unnecessary once you tear
this thing apart and I think that's
maybe a way of reducing PCB thickness or
something going with a higher taller
board instead but that's one small thing
here in terms of the rest of this it
does have a 10 phase powered design so
the V RMS got ten phases significantly
better than the five plus one of the
reference design from Nvidia this is
running the twin frozer six cooler from
MSI which is brand-new for this
generation we talked about in a previous
video but it's got six heat pipes they
are eight millimeters and that's most of
the cooling and the rest is done through
these to push fans which push dissipate
the heat out pretty standard stuff but
it does reduce thermals pretty
significantly over that reference design
so for the benchmarks will start with
thermal performance since that's the
most noteworthy with an AIB partner card
and then we'll dive into noise fps
overclock and all that stuff keep in
mind that we don't publish all our data
in these videos for time reasons but
check the article linked in the
description below to find all the gaming
benchmarks so for thermals MSI's Twin
Frozr 6 as I said has eight millimeter
heat pipes six of them that feed into
the cold plate the aluminum heatsink
has a heat dissipated through the to
push fans and then those are capable of
operating at zero rpm where the
temperatures are below 60 C or when the
watt draw is below a certain number msi
calls this zero frozer and as
of the silence option of the card rather
than the performance option and the
feature can be disabled if you prefer
just run better thermals the aftermarket
cooler pushes the GTX 1080s thermals
down to 45 point 3 Celsius delta T /
ambient and that's running the higher
clock rate as well so we've already put
ourselves in a good position here the
difference is a full 12 Celsius delta T
versus the reference design which is 20
2.75% if you convert it to a percent
difference the idle temperature runs
higher on MSI's card but the increase is
negligible and really not noticeable at
all to a user other than the fact that
the fans are running at zero rpm so it's
got a couple degrees warmer idle for a
much lower load temperature and for
better silence during the low load times
this is a serious improvement over the
reference design which had a thermal
wall of 82 Celsius that's absolute
naught Delta so that would put you in
the 60s or so for the Delta metric but
eighty-two Celsius was the thermal wall
at which point we saw some pretty heavy
throttling on the clock and that's
resolved by these aftermarket coolers
which is something we proved before
these are even out by building a custom
1080 hybrid using the 980ti hybrid
solution from EVGA and then throwing it
onto a 1080 so we already showed how
that works and this is a further proof
of concept where we're not hitting that
endurance limiter here's a look at our
noise at testing chart where we have
decibel levels of this cooler against
the founders Edition cooler and other
products but if you want to read
specific analysis on noise check the
article and we also have test
methodology there for you now note that
while doing this noise testing we did
observe some coil wine when overclocking
but it was nothing that would be
troublesome if the card were installed
inside of a case and an open-air bench
though it was a little bit noticeable
frame rate on the MSI GTX 1080 gaming X
is unsurprisingly improved over the
reference card running the clock rate at
its OC mode which is the default mode
our review sample is running at produces
reasonable gains / reference but we were
expecting a lower price than reference
and that's not the case
so the argument is definitely a little
more difficult to make when the card is
part
tired despite being overall better the
value is muddied patched that's $700
mark anyway let's go to FPS tests so
first of all the tests for FPS are in
the article below but we'll start off
with GTA 5 which shows a minimal FPS
gain with the MSI gaming X flavor of the
GT X 1080 when playing at 4k we're
seeing a gap of 2 FPS or 4.0 2% and at
1080p so driving 4k that translates to a
3.5% Delta which again not very
impressive but still we're already
reasonably ahead of the reference card
in FPS and well ahead of it in thermals
and noise in some ways so not terribly
noticeable but not terrible either black
ops 3 posts the 1080 gaming X at 211 FPS
average for 1080p high settings which is
really only reasonable if you're trying
to hit 200 Hertz for some reason and
that's a 9 FPS gain over the FE card or
4.5% and at 1440p that gain is somewhat
carried with 140 FPS for the gaming X
versus 135 point three for the reference
card or about a three point four percent
delta 4k has us at seventy one point
three fps verses 68 FPS on the reference
card and that's a 4.7 percent delta so
we're in the three to five range overall
for black ops 3 and in the 3 to 4 range
percentages for GTA 5 shadow of mordor
at 1440p puts us at 108 FPS the pre OC
gain and that's a one point eight seven
percent climb over the FE card at 4k
we're seeing a couple FPS gained that
amounts to about a four percent John 10
performing
overall and again as with the previous
ones that none of this is overall
impressive but somewhat expected for
what is effectively at factory
overclocked GT X 1080 the differences
should shine most and thermals and noise
though and theoretically in overclock II
but we'll get to that soon like previous
titles ashes of singularity is showing
more or less identical performance
between the cards the 1080p high test
has the gaming X
are just barely over 1 FPS ahead of the
EFI card for dx12 that is outside of
margin of error but it is pretty close
to margin of error dx11 has us within
0.5 FPS difference not percent FPS at 4k
high with ashes we see a couple FPS
gained with the gaming X but it is again
more or less inconsequential at a 6.0 to
% Delta for K crazy shows a bit more
difference and seems to be hinging on
the clock rate more heavily than the
previous cards is because it's becoming
GP throttled and that posts a delta of
12.6% difference between DX 12 tests on
the F II and the gaming X cards that
Delta is 7.1 2 presents when running DX
11 instead this thing we had a maximum
core clock resting at 20 50 megahertz
all totaled and the memory clock was 54
54 megahertz and that's an effective of
almost 11 gigabits per second the power
target on this card maxes out at 107
percent so it's a lower power target
percentage than the founders Edition
card but the power design is much
different so it's not necessarily a
one-to-one linear comparison in that
regard I mean we've got an extra power
header so that is the limit on power
it's 107 percent of what this board can
provide the vcore stops at one point
zero six two volts and that seems to be
a hard limit because when we hit the
forty percent offset for voltage it was
not any different than when we went 50
60 70 percent of whatever is all 1.06 2
volts so here's a look at our chart
showing the stepping for this video card
and overclocking it you can see the
passes and fails of different endurance
or brief initial tests showing our final
clock rate of 20 50 megahertz and then
here is a look at our GT X 1080
reference or founders edition results
where we settled at about 20 25 to 20 30
megahertz somewhere in that range and
the GN hybrid our custom liquid solution
that uses an EVGA 980ti hybrid cooler
but on the 1080 that we built managed to
pull off 21 64 megahertz
max so keep in mind that these are real
tests we could push these clock rates
way higher if we just ran fur mark or
something and did synthetic tests like
you'll find in some places but the
problem with these synthetic tests is
they often load the GPU in one way very
specifically and maintain that load
throughout the test so you don't have
this fluctuation in the clock rate like
you do with real gaming where the GPU
will throttle back when it's not
necessary or push harder when there is a
really complex geometrically intense
scene or something like that so you
don't see that with synthetic testing
that's why we use these games fire
strike is a good alternative for kind of
live overclocking just figuring stuff
out and these results are what with the
card similar to this one at least given
variances for the the silicon lottery
they are representative of what you will
achieve for a real gaming scenario
basically a 20 50 megahertz output and
then here is the FPS differences in the
charts now overall you'll see a couple
percentage points difference at best
from the OC mode and our manual OC and
that's really about what you would
expect for this type of overclock so
overclocking it wasn't really that
exciting it wasn't bad it was still a
twenty to twenty five megahertz increase
over our founders edition testing but in
no way is that worth another twenty
dollars what is worth another twenty
dollars though is the substantially
improved thermal solution this thing
brings you down twelve Celsius that puts
you way below the eighty-two Celsius
wall where there's throttling and that's
the next important point is that even
though the gaming X doesn't overclock in
its core clock significantly higher than
the founders Edition the endurance
testing is much better and this is
something that we just started doing
recently we will run an endurance test
to see how well a clock rate sustains
over time as he generates so it does
resolve some of that thermally we saw
about a 25 percent improvement in
temperatures noise is reasonable it's
effectively zero DB output when running
below 60 Celsius if you have that
Abell the zero frozer technology that
they've got in here which is really just
a fan throttle that most these cards
have these days and then in terms of
overclocking itself the gaming actually
marginally improves over the founder's
edition this seems to be more of a
limitation with Pascal than with say MSI
so this is really a thin on Pascal slash
Nvidia where there's maybe a V bios or
voltage limitation or some other kind of
wall where it's very difficult to get
these things over 2100 or even at 2100
megahertz of the exception being our
hybrid where we did some special tuning
but in general that seems to be about
the limit I'm not clear yet if that's
because of volatility of the FinFET
process or what's going on there but
that does appear to be about the limit
on these cards FPS 1.8 percent to 12
percent better with overclocking
depending on what game generally about 5
percent average improvement for
overclocking and the card itself
ignoring overclocking so thermals are
good we've said noise is reasonable the
price I am NOT a fan of I don't think
that $700 is a good price for the 1080
in general and 720 I really don't think
is a great price so right now most of
these cards are $1,000 on Amazon I'm
saying this one specifically I'm saying
all GTX 1080s you can find today are 800
to a thousand dollars which is insane do
not pay that amount of money for for the
1080 that's just a supply and demand
thing it will calm down prices will fall
they always do so hopefully the 720 kind
of drops below the reference price as
things normalize but I wouldn't be a
buyer at this price right now I'd want
it to at least be 700 if not slightly
lower next thing this is certainly much
better than the reference design it's
got a better power management setup oops
a better power management setup it's got
two times the phases for the GPU and
although the clock rate is capped around
the same loose stability is better now
one thing I'd really like to see MSI
improve on is the height of the
cards I know they're doing this whole
gamer thing but this is just it's just
too tall I don't know that it needs to
be maybe a thicker PCB would resolve
some of this but the height is an issue
for many ITX builds it's obnoxious for
SLI if you're trying to mix and match
cards which whatever you shouldn't do
but I mean people do it and it's just
unnecessary so that is one thing I like
to see improves but they're not alone
here at gigabyte does the same thing and
it drives me crazy but that that's how
it is it's a very small complaint in
terms of what you should buy I would
suggest waiting right now because the
markets about to flood with 1080s from
all these different vendors and EVGA has
got their hybrid coming out we've heard
rumor that should be 700 dish or below
below this maybe is a possibility if
that is the case be a very serious thing
to consider FTW is also coming from EGA
that's air cooled and then gigabytes got
the g1 gaming which is cheaper than this
I believe from memory that one is in the
650 range and then the extreme gaming
one is in the 680 range so those would
be worth considering as well the issues
Strix will be cheaper than this as well
so depending on what you want it's worth
looking around waiting for more reviews
and honestly none of these are really
available at their advertised prices
right now anyway so it doesn't do harm
for you to just relax take a few weeks
research these things see what's going
on now as far as when they will it be
available at reasonable prices we've
heard through board partners not MSI
specifically but through others to
expect sometime in the next month
that's supply and demand that may
stabilize and that's when you'll see the
prices kind of hit where they should be
so you've got a good month to research
things and figure it out if not
potentially more but that's it that's
what I got for you having trouble
hitting 20 100 megahertz on any of these
liquid notwithstanding in our special
test as always patreon link post roll
