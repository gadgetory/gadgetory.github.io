weekly recap we're going over the last
week of hardware news so if you missed
up is the place to be for this coverage
we're looking at things like new
displays some motherboard announcements
coolers and open and closed loop
varieties also got one peripheral a case
a video card and a power supply so
that's the news for the last week before
that this video is brought to you by
course there's that new Vengeance RGB
LED Ram which ships with custom screens
ICS for better overclocking performance
and stability given that memory is
highly relevant for performance with new
rising CPUs now is a good time to do
research on high performance kits start
with the Vengeance RGB LED kit at the
link in the description below
first up LG's got a new monitor coming
out this one is a production targeted
monitor it has some really cool features
on it like an integrated KVM or keyboard
video mouse switch so that means you
could plug in one set of keyboard video
and mouse and have two computers feeding
into the monitor so that's always a nice
thing to include it is the LG 43 UD 79 -
B and if you're wondering what those
numbers and letters mean the 43 is
rounded up from 42.5 which is the inch
size of the monitor so 42.5 IPS displays
a 4k panel and the 79 I have no idea
what it stands for the B stands for
black so that's all these new monitor
this thing is targeted primarily at
production as stated it's got an 8
millisecond great a great response not
fantastic for gaming and other than that
it does it I mean it technically has a
game mode built-in which is supposed to
help with input latency and things like
that sometimes they help sometimes they
do absolutely nothing it's just
something you have to test on a per
Display basis it has a black stabilizer
it's got precinct so freesync is
integrated now well Vegas coming out
soon unfortunately up until they got
when you have free sync on an expensive
display it's kind of a weird setup
because your choices until very recently
we ran our X 480 to go with your
expensive monitor and those two don't
normally mix but with Vega that will
change so freeze things on there it is a
60 Hertz refresh
and that eight millisecond gray.gray
means not particularly a gaming targeted
device but there are plenty of 4k panels
out there that can do high refresh
coming out very soon
other features include 315 it's a
brightness it's got a 104 pixels per
inch density one DisplayPort port that's
a 1.2 a version 2 HDMI 2.0 two HDMI 1.4
USB 3.0 types C with DP alt mode which
is becoming more common these days and
finally there are two USB 3.0 hubs with
be built-in KVM switch as stated earlier
so this is LG's newest display one final
side interesting note it can display
image from four devices at once so
you've got four picture inputs it will
segment them into quadrants so you've
got four quadrants each 21 by 21.5 1080p
sections so pretty cool stuff
not really gaming torian's but
interesting nonetheless for the
technology next up ACS has their new
Maximus 9 extreme GT 70 board that we've
seen in the past we saw some of these
boards actually one of them at CES in
the Donkey Kong mod build that we did a
video on but the Maximus 9 extreme GT
sunny board hasn't really been available
widely it should be now it's finally
shipping on mass it was debuted in March
and most prominently the board boasts an
integrated mono block in collaboration
with bits power so that's the version
that's seen widespread now and features
a built in flow rate meter water leakage
and in the outlet temperature sensors
that are controllable via UEFI or Asus
if an expert for utility and also
included our 12 fan headers on the board
eight of which are radiator fan headers
and two being water pump headers which
all that means really is labeling on
them and other than that you've got
headers for flow rates temperature and
RGB lighting so this is definitely an
enthusiast class open-loop targeted
board it does not really belong and use
for something with a CPU power cooler on
it other notables include 2 m dot 2
slots
support for Stata PCIe by 4 nbme or
Intel octane now 8 SATA 3 ports 8 USB
3.0 and 4 USB 2.0 ports the
headers and there's also your normal mix
of thunder both Gigabit Ethernet HDMI
all that stuff with of course to
reinforce PCIe x16 slots because you
need metal reinforcement on everything
now apparently overclocking support is
always one of the biggest features of
the rog motherboards that this one has
the voltage check points in a few places
these are not too uncommon these days on
the higher end boards so there's
something you see more prevalently on
stuff like a Maximus class rog board but
they've got q-code LED lm2 mode jumpers
slow mode switches are SPD switches
retry button safefood buttons which by
the way are amazing it's so good to have
a safe boot button now I'm okay DRAM
channel jumpers and rog extension
connectors so lots of cool stuff if
you're wondering what all that closed
stuff costs the answer is 630 dollars so
this is something targeted that more of
the extreme overclocking enthusiast type
of people but certainly worth looking
into just because the technology is kind
of neat deep cool has an updated captain
e^x that's supposed to be coming out in
June it is the RGB version so that's
it's really that's all there is to say
it's the deep cool captain IX now with
RGB that is priced at $100 to the 120 X
version which is obviously 120
milliliters 130 for the 240 X which is
240 millimeter and I have off camera I
have a captain TX that we've been
working on we're in contact with people
now talking about some testing issues
but this is the one that we have pre RGB
the RGB version is the same just with
RGB LEDs this one I believe has a white
LED on the top and that's it so there's
an updated version of that that supposed
to come out in June after Computex TDP
rating is 150 watts on the CPU so it can
handle most of things out there okay
though we'll let you know how to
actually handle concert testing is
complete Corsair this week announced a
new high-end gaming mouse following the
announcement from Razer and rocket the
courser glaive RGB is their new aluminum
frame mouse it is right-handed and you
interchangeable thumb grips of which
three are included the glaive uses a
16,000 dpi sensor provided by pix arts
that could be adjusted from 100 to
16,000 dpi with a polling rate
adjustable for lunch
five 1000 Hertz the mouse buttons are
made up of Omron micro switches rated
for 50 million clicks these are fairly
common in this type of Mouse it's
nothing special and there are six
programmable buttons of the mouse this
is all done through Corsairs cue
software which also allows for backlight
zone adjustment which there are three
zones on this particular Mouse you can
assign macros to buttons they're stored
dpi and lighting settings things like
that the coarser glaive RGB should
already be available I think I'm not
sure if we're going to review that one
it's a $70 Mouse that's sort of where
the g502 sits these days that was a good
Mouse when we reviewed it but we've
actually mostly moved on to the G 900 at
the end and the G 403 for something a
bit lighter so the glaive we haven't
looked at or gotten hands on yet but
that's one to look out for from a
Corsair liquid cooling news there's
stuff from ek this week ek water blocks
now offers users the opportunity to
purchase the CPC quick disconnect
couplings found in their predator line
of AIO coolers the couplings are
intended to be used with soft tubing
with an internal diameter of 10
millimeters and outer diameters of 13 or
16 millimetres clamps are included for
both sizes and prices are set at $33
these can be ordered through ekw B
directly and are new as of this week
there's a new water block for the Asus
1080p is Strix Edition that we're
reviewing later this week and it is the
Pacific 5 at GTX 1080i Strix transparent
water block that's made in collaboration
with thermal take of Pacific didn't give
that away the water block will be
transparent on the front side it's a
full coverage block so that covers vrm
components and vram and the GPU itself
it's got clear acrylic top affixed to a
nickel plated copper base plate and for
those unaware nickel plating it's just
used for the look basically there is
some protection against things like
galvanic corrosion it's not going to
damage your cooling performance in any
way but other than that the water block
does come with an included four
millimeter backplate it's got standard G
quarter inch fittings pricing and
availability currently unknown but that
is the Pacific
5 GTX
atti water blog from thermal taken to
Asus in power supply news silverstone
has added two models to their
entry-level essential series a line of
power supplies these are the ET 5 5 0 -
b and ET 6 5 0 - b so that b 550 and 650
watts those units are 80 plus bronze
certified that's where the - becomes
rung if you're curious and although the
cables are fixed silverstone offers a
unique approach the cables are flat so
they're a bit less visible they are
blackout cables with no color coding for
the voltages and heavy duty protections
are limited just to over power
protection over voltage protection and
short-circuit protection cooling is
handled by 120 millimetres sleeve
bearing fan and both units offer an mtbf
allegedly of 100,000 hours solar sun's
got a 3-year warranty on those
availability is limited to EU with us
availability to be determined in the
case department courser has taken their
spec alpha case and spec oh one and
shifted it to the budget market so there
they basically shrunken it and change
the face a bit but it's obviously the
same ID so this new one is the spec of
four it's a $50 enclosure the original
spec I remember course are telling me
when it first launched actually before
launch we saw it in their facility I
pointed at it and we kind of made jokes
about it but it was targeted for an Asia
only launch because it they knew it
would sell really well there well turns
out it's culturally well in the US as
well so now they've got the spec o4 and
that's targeted at a bit of everyone so
the spec alpha we've shown in the past
and PC build spec up for we have coming
in and we'll be reviewing that will be a
new accompaniment to the $50 line
there's some radiator support I don't
know that many people put 240 ml video
heaters in a $50 case but you could do
that with this one 120 is also supported
and this is more of a clean line with
kind of a bold color statement on it you
can get grey yellow or I believe red for
the colours it looks just kind of like a
distorted version of the spec alpha if
that's your thing then cool they have it
for you it can fit five fans and I mean
other that we'll have a review for you
shortly to talk about how the actual
performances in terms of thermal down
acoustics but keep an eye out for that
make sure to subscribe so you don't miss
it finally new video card for this week
can't go a week without a video card the
MSI 1080 TI now gets a well there's
already a Seahawk edition but now
there's a Seahawk ekx edition this is
similar to the previous Seahawk ekx the
X means that it's pre overclocked and
then Seahawk means is liquid cooled ek
means it uses ek water box so it's an
open-loop card rather than the Seahawk
that existed prior to the ek version
what's the closed-loop card using an ASA
tech cooler and this has a full coverage
block from ek WB as you might expect it
features the msi dragon design as always
and it uses the same PCB as the gaming X
so we reviewed the 1080p I gaming X
already and we have a full PCB analysis
of it done by builds or if you're
curious about what this card is like in
terms of PCB vrm electoral layout all
that stuff you already know you can
watch our 1080i gaming x PCB analysis
that is the same thing so this will be a
liquid-cooled version I don't have a
price for you today but it's certainly
more expensive than the gaming X
standalone version the stock speeds are
1569 megahertz base 1683 boost with a
memory speed of 11 129 so 11.1 kickers
on the memory as always that you can
