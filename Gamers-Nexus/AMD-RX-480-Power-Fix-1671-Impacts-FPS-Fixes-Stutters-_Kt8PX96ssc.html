one drivers before the RX 480 and we
showed that in our four gigabyte versus
eight gigabyte benchmark that was posted
yesterday of the day before and that
update was provided to us strictly to
look at GTA 5 where it resolved
stuttering issues is something we
actually saw the stuttering issues have
kind of receded in GTA 5 with 16.7 dot 1
the release drivers were 16 dot 6.2 but
there's another thing that 16.7 dot one
theoretically resolves in that coincides
and these newest statement on their PCIe
bus power draw for the RX 480 so the
statements pretty long I've got the
whole thing posted at an article you can
hit that in the link below but the
relevant parts of this statement are
addressing the power draw on the PCIe
bus and AMD specifically says we're
pleased to report that this driver
Radeon software 16 7 1 is now undergoing
final testing and will be released to
the public in the next 48 hours and
that's the main part but the thing here
is this is introducing a compatibility
switch so it's a toggle button in Radeon
software and that toggle allows you to
basically enable a throttle for the
power if you're concerned about the PCIe
bus drawing too much power and
potentially damaging components in the
system like the motherboard if if that
is a concern to you it doesn't
necessarily have to be de set de pending
on what sort of components you're using
but it will be a toggle the toggle will
definitely throttle performance to some
extent but it may not be a large amount
we'll see I will validate that as soon
as we've got a final build of the driver
and to that end
AMD actually says we've included an
option to reduce total power with
minimal performance impact users will
find this as the compatibility UI toggle
in global settings and it's off by
default that means that it will be
drawing the amount shown in our initial
review by default and they say finally
we've implemented a collection of
performance improvements that improve
performance in some games at the
three-percent and these optimizations
are designed to improve the performance
of the rx 480 and this is the important
part so
pay attention here these should offset
the performance impact for users who
choose to activate the compatibility
toggle or should substantially offset is
what they actually say so clearly there
is a performance impact with this
compatibility switches off by default so
the card out of box will resemble what
the reviews are showing if you turn it
on just based on this this sort of
obvious wording there will be a
performance reduction that's because
there will be less power going to the
card and the way that will manifest
itself is the clock rate will likely be
sort of down clocking more frequently to
reduce the power draw so you're gonna
get either a less stable clock rate or a
lower overall clock rate but that's how
the power patch will likely work and
then there's the performance
improvements before title so we saw
those in GTA 5 like with stuttering and
the actual fps so it sounds like this
will be resolved in some form we will
still be doing endurance testing on the
PCIe bus with the original card with
that setting turned off it's off by
default anyway so it makes sense to test
that but overall that's kind of what we
got from AMD right now in terms of the
PCIe bus check the content on 4
gigabytes versus 8 gigabytes if you're
interested in more on our X 480 or of
course the full review and if you're not
really sure what this problem is I would
recommend checking the actually Tom's
Hardware had one of the best posts on it
in their review they have power testing
that a lot of sites don't because
equipment costs so that's where you
should start if you want to learn about
what's happening and then check back
here if you want to learn about how it's
resolved if it's resolved and if in the
real world this is a problem because we
have another video coming out with some
cheap from other board parts and things
like that that we bought to see if the
power draw kills anything so as always
thanks for watching patreon commercial
video if you wanna helps out directly I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
