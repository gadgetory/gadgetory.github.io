Ridge AP use and you tried to stick it
into a motherboard that had not been
flashed to support them obviously it
wouldn't have worked you'd get a black
screen and the correct approach would be
to either hopefully you have a board
that supports USB flash or find a Rison
or similar a m4 processor socket it
flash bios and then put your new raven
or cpu in there unfortunately not
everyone has extra CPUs lying around so
AMD can't with a boot kit program which
we've tested by basically going through
the warranty process as a customer would
we've done this in the past with system
integrators where it's more or less a GN
goes undercover and acts like a customer
to see how the warranty and the service
program is so this is a kind of a mini
review slash recap of that process and
if you're stuck on what to do with an
APU we can finally give you some direct
feedback of what to expect from the boot
kit and how to use it before that this
video is brought to you by the new cable
mod pro series cable mods a new pro
cables come with pre-installed closed
combs for clean builds accompanied by a
revamp to color style and vibrance the
cables are now using thicker wires and
they've also added right-angled internal
USB 3 extension and right angled SATA
data cables by the pro series cable kits
at the link below or customize it your
cable set with the configurator also
linked below the AMD boot kit for the AP
use is pretty straightforward it comes
in this box and what they send out is an
APU from last year it is the as6 9500
it's a 56 ish dollar CPU through US
retailers has an AR 5 integrated
graphics processor on it not
particularly impressive but you're not
supposed to keep it either so this goes
back to AMD their service was actually
pretty good
they provide a shipping label and
everything so they make it easy for you
which was I wasn't expecting the
shipping label so that was nice
the cooler they technically allow you to
keep there's not a lot of reason to
actually use it it's not very good but
it's kind of neat they let you keep it I
guess honestly it's probably more of
like a freight or get rid of the
Thane's thing than anything but whatever
you get a cooler out of it maybe you can
use it on something low-end in the
future so that's what we get the process
for getting it is what we're here to
talk about mostly so this would be the
customer service process going through
customer support like a real consumer
and seeing how they treat us
versus how media gets treated for
example and we were honestly pretty
impressed we first reached out to Andy
via their boot kit application website
on February 17th and they replied with
an automated response that just said
your customer your service request has
been received and will be processed
shortly and depending on the nature of
it dictates how quickly they get back to
us that was on Saturday the 17th that we
emailed them we got a response from an
actual person on the 21st so Wednesday
and the response was a form letter that
said dear Steven your service request
ticket number was received and they said
thank you for your request to loan a
boot kit from AMD before approving your
request
I'd like to verify that you've tried to
contact your mother board manufacturer
or their local authorized service
provider and they have established that
your motherboard requires a BIOS update
and we're not able to help you perform
that update please provide a summary or
copy of your communication with the
motherboard manufacturer to indicate why
support from the original design
manufacturer is not suitable MD is in a
position to be able to loan a boot kit
such that you can flash the BIOS
yourself to qualify for the service MD
will require a picture of your Rison
with Radeon at Vega graphics processor
that clearly shows the model number and
serial number plus a copy of your
purchase invoice
once we receive this information we'll
be happy to review your claim to
establish let legibility that's not a
that's not me miss speaking legibility
for a boot kit loan if you no longer
require this service no response is
required we replied to that pretty
quickly and just sent a note that said
we spoke with a motherboard manufacturer
and that the manufacturer didn't provide
any direct support and flash in the BIOS
we didn't say anything about retailer
communication this was me being a dumb
customer basically so I just said we
spoke to someone and they
couldn't help us which wasn't true but
the point was to see do we have to jump
through hoops to prove that we spoke to
someone at which point I'd probably
email Asus for gigabyte and ask them for
some help but so yeah it's just pretty
simple I said yes I talked to them no
they couldn't help me what can you do
for me and they asked for a photo of the
processor so I just took the processor
honestly wasn't motherboard at the time
was socket and had a cooler on it didn't
really feel like hunting it so I took
another APU another the 2200 G and took
a photo of that next to the box for it
where you could clearly see the serial
number on the box I provided them the
serial number the model all that stuff
sent it over and they replied pretty
quickly as well and we get the timeline
on that so we responded on the 21st with
the photo and the communication info and
they responded on the 22nd actually at
4:00 a.m. so pretty quickly thereafter
and they stated thank you for the
response and providing details to
qualify for the service and they will
require a copy of your purchase invoice
once we receive will be happy to
establish your legibility for the boot
kit I can't really knock them too bad
for messing up that word twice I guess
but so that's all we had to do just send
them an invoice basically from Newegg so
sent them an invoice from Newegg and the
photos and we got a boot kit within a
couple days the whole process start to
finish
was from point of contact to receiving
the apu in the mail was about nine days
and that's considering we contacted on a
Saturday not that bad so it's about a
week and I could be up to 10 days or
more depending on how slow your
representative is from what we
understand but not bad honestly so going
into this you should first know that if
you actually end up in this situation
you have an AM four board that doesn't
support Raven Ridge first go to the
retailer if you're lucky enough to have
the Micro Center or similar near you
they should probably flash it for you I
think they're supposed to
so through AMD guidance I'm pretty sure
that the retailers are supposed to offer
some service hopefully without charging
you for it that's my understanding if
the retailer is no good for that then
the next step I think is technically
supposed to be contacting the
motherboard manufacturer at which point
they either cross ship p1 or they flash
it depending on their warranty policy
that could potentially take longer than
getting a boot kit I don't know what
kind of wait times there are for these
things obviously there wasn't much of
one for us and we applied early for it
so honestly in that position personally
I just get the boot kit straight away
because it might be faster than going
through a board vendor where you could
be waiting a couple weeks this was 9 or
10 days so yeah support was pretty good
as far as using it if you actually need
help with that it's time put the CPU in
the socket turn it on boots a BIOS
download the relevant BIOS from the
motherboard manufacturer specifically
for that board - a USB key plug it in go
to their Flash utility and navigate to
that BIOS and hit enter and then that's
it turn it off replace it with APU and
you should be good to go
cpu goes back to AMD they actually did
provide like I said a shipping label so
it's very happy about that as far as
customer service process goes
considering the situation where you just
bought a new CPU you probably bought a
new motherboard and you can't use either
that's pretty frustrating experience if
you if you're not positive why they're
not working you might not know that
there's a BIOS flash saying considering
that's the situation to be able to get
something from support that allows you
to self-correct the issue within 10 days
is certainly not the worst it'd be nice
to be faster but if you're not near a
retailer it's not going to be and the
process overall the support
representative we worked with was very
clear they communicated well they had
very clear instructions when we asked
questions of those instructions they
were acted they're hand-holding
basically for a dumb customer so they do
all the things you'd want so yeah I was
I was pretty impressed with the warranty
process for this we haven't tested
actually like a broken
GP or CP or anything but for a boot kit
or worked out pretty well if this is the
route you want to go we can recommend it
straightforward and easy and if you have
trouble flashing bios tweeted at us
because it should be solvable in a
couple seconds so oh yeah that's it
not really much there other than saying
the boot kit process was was pleasantly
surprising in the support department
because we've gone through support a
couple times with other things we've
done like undercover support stuff with
some s eyes that doesn't always turn out
that well I guess the best example would
be look at how Rockstar Games support
coverage from a few years ago there's a
reason that was popular but that's it
for this one as always subscribe for
more if you like this type of kind of
like GN goes undercover thing let us
know we'll try and do more of it I just
need to break something first so that I
can have a reason to go through a
warranty and subscribe for more
