same couple of companies and today what
we're going to do is show you the
internals of various closed-loop liquid
coolers as they're available on the
market so these are mostly coarse air
coolers we also have an EVGA cooler but
there's one common thread between them
and that's a Sutekh the difference is
that corsair somewhat recently has gone
back to using the other supplier cool it
for its h1 15i Platinum cooler so the
difference is we're gonna take this
apart today see if cool it has any
internal changes from what ASA Tech's
doing and they probably do and then talk
about the differences between really
just the couple of actual cooler
suppliers that exist on the market and
how they relate to the manufacturing
brands that you all know before that
this video is brought to you by EVGA SZ
390 dark motherboard the Z 390 dark is a
flagship motherboard for Intel's
unlocked case cue CPUs with tuning done
by overclocked engineering team
kingpin and 10 to enable higher memory
and CPU frequencies the motherboard uses
a unique rotated socket design to move
EPS 12-volt cables to the right side
making cable management easier and also
sticks to two DIMM slots to improve
memory overclocking stability and
Headroom we previously analyzed the BRM
in full and found it among the best in
class 4 z 390 overclocking and it also
got rid of RGB LEDs learn more at the
link in the description below we've
previously done teardown videos of these
coolers but let's just walk through it
for all of our newer viewers this is an
EVGA c LC 120 and this was a product we
didn't recommend buying the CLC 280 or
240 we're fine but this just didn't make
any sense either way though
the way they're assembled is all the
same and the difference is just radiator
size in the fan and ultimately the
difference really between corsair EVGA
NZXT is mostly going to be Fant ice and
RGB LEDs and the design of the identity
of the cooler but the product itself
doesn't really change from product to
product in terms of the the Pampas so
this is what an ASA tech pump looks like
there are different generations
there's Gen 4 there's Gen 5 is Gen 4.5
and we have some like this old court
aah 1:10 this is what's left of a years
old teardown we did but that's the
impeller for it's the same impeller
design for the ACE attack gen Forge and
four point five into five designs and
it's just sockets in there it's a magnet
and it's got three prongs and it spins
that's all there is to it we'll cut to
some footage of the Gen six pump design
where the impeller is a much larger
piece of metal that sits inside of the
entire interior of the pump housing so
it's a bit higher quality but the real
difference is between generations a
pretty minor and in terms of thermals
the Gen six cooler is actually worse
than the Gen 5 pump from ASA tech and
that's just because Gen six focused more
on permeation so the biggest issue with
liquid coolers is with time there is
permeation the radio rate of permeation
is not as bad with Gen six but it's
still there and what happens is the
liquid permeates into the tubes ASA tech
uses rubberized tubes they're much more
flexible there's no interior housing so
on the Coolermaster tubes there's
actually an interior teflon coating and
that would prevent this kind of Bend I'm
doing right now if you did this on the
coolermaster ones like what's used on
the fury X then what would happen is
you'd crack that teflon lining inside
and the permeation we really bad so
they're less flexible but that teflon
liner does help a lot with permeation is
just the downside is obviously there
this there is going to be permeation
that's why most of them are rated for
five years of use and so the changes to
Gen six for permeation the internals of
the average ASA tech pump go like this
there's the cold plate and it has a
bunch of micro fins in it they are very
dense we have a video showing how liquid
coolers are made where we have some
footage and we'll pop that into of the
skyvan machine that makes these cold
plates so it's copper contact to the CPU
or the device the cold the micro fins
give you a lot more surface area the
water goes through those fins that way
and the only limitation is making sure
there's not too much flow impedance
where if the fins are too close together
the liquid actually can't move through
it so that would be bad so this is what
you end up with there's a set of
channels in here too
you and this gasket goes on top of it so
the gasket goes on top you can see how
it lines up right here so this gasket
just pops down on top of the cooler and
this might not be the exact one for this
cooler but it's there all the same idea
and this still has the plate on it for
this one we pulled this off of but you
can see the inner chamber design it's
got a piece of foam here this is often
for vibration reducing some of that coil
or the pump line so the pump vibration
noise there's the top of the pump
housing which has the outlet and Inlet
for the tubes and the electromagnet as
well that powers the action of the pump
itself and then you'd socket everything
in here so that would be the cold plate
goes in here there's some corrosion but
you get the idea so the cold plate goes
in there water goes in one goes through
the cold plate comes out the other some
assembly elements this isn't on all of
the A's tech coolers but it's another
foam damper that goes into this part and
that's just for vibration reduction once
again if I remember correctly NZXT has
one as well we've teardown videos of
those two when the pumps come in and out
of the housing and that's really about
it
one of the other differences in Gen 5
and Gen 4 is how the pumps are mounted
going into the top versus coming off the
side that the manufacturer could change
this and I'm the PCB designs here so the
PCB this is e BGA's but NZXT made its
own PCB
something that a stack really doesn't
allow but they did for Gen 5 with NZXT
and this has on it a thermocouple which
is right here so that probe is coated in
thermal paste and it sits down into the
liquid chamber so that you can get a
liquid temperature reading if the liquid
temperature goes over 60 degrees Celsius
then you start having some serious well
two problems one of them is serious
permeation issues the other one is you
start damaging the plastic inside of the
pump and so AC Tech's maximum rated
temperature 60 degrees liquid
temperature not CP temperature much big
much much different in what those
numbers means so 60 C internally would
mean your CP is really roasting where
you have high case ambient so that's how
those
this is an older AC tech design coarser
h1 10 you can see the coils for the
motor motor itself the PCB and then the
impeller down there but impeller for
most these designs up until Gen 6 was
the same Gen 4.5 was just a faster
faster pump speed useful for things like
GPU cooling with the EVGA hybrid coolers
or what thermal takes flow so that is
what they typically look like that's an
ASA tech pump more or less that's really
all there is to it even the modern
versions we have here an H 150 i this
was previously disassembled as you can
tell pieces of it aren't put back in
right now and it has some corrosion on
the cold plate but well that we
hopefully have already shown some
footage will pop some more in but the
interior is a bit different otherwise
the disassembly process is about the
same for all the others and then today
we're taking apart the H 115 i Platinum
so this is one we're taking apart today
and the bottom of it is secured with
just Phillips heads that's nice
hopefully they're not as tight as the
a-stack ones they stack ones are really
hard to get out we've historically had
to drill at least one of the screws out
because they just they get stuck and
that's because of how tight they're
screwed and out the factory and then not
quite sure what these things are right
here is three of them one two three it
might just be to help align the plate
onto the block onto the chamber but
we'll see once we take it apart so this
one we're going to take the cold plate
off first that'll drain it and then
we'll go from there
all right Wow okay well much easier
start than the AC tech ones which isn't
necessarily good or bad but these tech
ones we'd already be straining right now
to get these screws out there also
typically torques so we'll speed through
this process and then see what's
underneath
so there's a there's just a small spot
where you could force it open with a
wedge and that was by design so we pop
that off so this liquid is this is just
propylene glycol these mixtures and
liquid coolers are distilled water and
propylene glycol typically it's about 20
percent propylene glycol but they'll go
up to 40 percent depending on the
storage and usage conditions industrial
applications might use a higher percent
distilled water is better for thermal
capacity and transfer but propylene
glycol is used for four reasons like
better cold storage temperatures things
like that it also has a biocide in it to
kill any bacterial growth because water
is a great place for that to grow let's
empty out the rest of this cooler so
here's the cold plate that came out and
once again we have a gasket on top this
is for directing the flow together or
actually it's it's just on the inside of
the cold plate if we peel the gasket off
which is just rubber you'll see the
micro fins so here's the kulit micro
fins and here's the a sec one a lot of
these pump makers and the closed-loop
liquid cooler makers just like anything
else they buy a lot of their stuff from
elsewhere so we don't know if if cool
it's making their own cold plate or if
they're just buying it from someone who
has a skiving machine or a lot of them
but that's what it looks like and same
for every other material like the rubber
gasket is very likely made by a third
party and then just designed by cool it
race attack so cool it's got a square it
off block the real question is just you
know is the contact area any different
is the fin pitch or density any
different and the fins actually are
different so if we get a close-up of
this you'll see that the cool it design
has a it's trapezoidal so the fins are
coming up at an angle over here
flattening and then coming back down
it's not that different for me
Tech is just that ace attacks is flat on
either side but otherwise it is the same
idea we don't have any tools to measure
the thin density unfortunately but but
we can see that the shape has changed a
bit the cool at ones are also actually
they're really not that different
ace attack keeping in mind is a bit more
square but it's text 31 millimeters or
so by roughly 26 millimeters and cool
it's about 30 millimeters by roughly 27
millimeters the difference being that
the last millimeter of cool it's is
shorter but otherwise they're really not
that different the squared off change is
quite different and then the fins the
micro fins themselves are about the same
there's also a difference up here so at
the top end right now you can see how
when it was manufactured it's got this
sweep coming down as opposed to the AC
tech design where the flow is is guided
a bit differently with the chamfered
edge all the way down to the bottom that
first fin instead of the angle going out
to the sides with the flow directed
around the micro fins and coming back in
alright that's just the mounting
mechanism okay alright so there's the
flow liquid comes in one of these comes
out of the other of course and in doing
so this plate is situated here to guide
it so there is a yeah this is my broken
screwdriver so it looks like it comes in
or out here not sure which it hits that
this looks like the impeller yeah the
impellers in there we can get a closer
look at that when we get disassembled
the rest so you can see I can actually
rotate it a little bit so it's hitting
the impeller in there and the liquid is
flowing it looks like
through this channel and and through
here and then through all the micro fins
that would be sandwiched right against
that so the water is going to flow out
of this or or into either way direction
I'm not positive on but water goes
through here and through the micro fins
beneath it and that's your direct path
what we need to do is get the impeller
out though and this is like a fill cap I
think but I'm not sure how to get it off
okay
it's tape okay really sticky tape
holding that in so really sticky tape
holding in the top plate which covers
two more screws all right well that's
one huge screw so that was going into
the LED diffuser plate and then this is
clipped in we've got foam just a pad for
vibration which is consistent with the
ASA tech designs under that fancy white
PCB for all the LEDs oh yeah you can see
the same thing too right here so you can
see those two copper wires there they're
probably going down to the coils
underneath which means as soon as I
remove this PCB those wires are gonna
snap but that's fine we're not
rebuilding this anyway so now we're
gonna break some coils some break some
copper wire off so before I snap it
there's what it looks like so that's
where the PCB connects to the coils and
we're gonna
terminate that connection sadly you can
see the wires are soldered into the PCB
but the PCB is not all that different
from what you'd find in really any other
product this pops up
there's the impeller okay alright so
there's the impeller base and you can
see that there's the copper coils will
be in there let's compare this
so AC tech design that's the same piece
right there and then the impeller goes
on the other side and this one uses it's
got a gasket as you would expect for
being a liquid cooling product and then
the motors in there the impeller is
quite a bit different so here's the
coolant impeller and then here's the old
ACE attack impeller then we'll show once
again briefly the Gen 6 impeller but Gen
6 impeller is pretty similar to cool it
choice here
whereas Gen 4 Gen 5 very different and
this will impact rate of flow and the
noise that you get out of the pump too
then the rest this is a fill port not
sure trying to remove it went wrong so
whatever it's fine we're not rebuilding
it anyway at this point these little
things we're not we didn't figure out
what those - just yet and then the tubes
come into the housing so it's really
pretty simple design but it's not too
dissimilar from ASA tax somehow it
theoretically doesn't interfere with the
patent that ASA tech has on putting a
pump inside of a block deep cool
bypasses this by having a multi chamber
approach other companies bypass it like
UK by having the pump built into the
radiator instead of into the CPU block
but it's it's worse for a lot of other
reasons like radiator size gets kind of
ballooned so anyway this is this is what
the cool it one looks like and you can
see just how the difference is more or
less boiled down to the impeller choice
and some of the flow choices but overall
it's the same basic idea
some differences and for example where
do you put the foam padding to damp the
noise and that's just gonna vary product
product based on where each one has
noise issues there's differences between
kulit and ASA tech we also we have some
old footage we'll go find and put in
here of the an Tek 1250 that used Dino
Tron for their supplier appalled texts
another popular supplier they have been
used by Silverstone in the past for
example and coolermaster makes their own
we've seen their factories and toured
them deep cool mostly makes their own
they're all about the same I mean they a
lot of these companies will assemble it
in-house they might buy an impeller from
over there rubber gasket from their
tubing from another place and then put
it the Killiney of the product but
that's what they look like on the inside
if you've been curious if you've felt
disillusioned that all the liquid
coolers are the same don't worry you
were pretty close to accurate but there
are some important differences so what
the companies actually do like what
courser does what NZXT EDA is what EVGA
does they dictate the design within the
parameters of what the generation of
pump can do or how much it can deviate
from the base spec so what they'll do is
design a PCB like this one Corsair had
in here whether or not they designed it
I'm not sure but typically the
manufacturer will design the PCB go to
the supplier and say we want to use this
PCB and then that will integrate with
whatever softer they want to do it'll
integrate or control the RGB LEDs that's
a huge differentiating factor these days
which is why you see it a lot the pump
speed to some extent can be dictated by
the the manufacturer the brand that puts
the name on it so if they want a faster
pompe slower pump they can somewhat
dictate that within the parameters or
the specs of the base product and then
the fans are the absolute biggest
difference beyond that it's things like
tube length tube color cabling cable
management and how the product comes
together they can also to some extent
dictate things like cold plate size so
Corsair because of course there was the
initial and primary partner for the ASA
tech Gen 6 pump of course her did get to
control a lot of the Gen 6 design as ASA
tech made it and that was a unique
advantage for Corsair so of course her
chose a very slightly smaller cold plate
for their Gen six coolers versus their
Gen 5 coolers and that's something that
courser was was to our knowledge
dictating not ASA tagging that's kind of
where they deviate fin pitch fin density
to some extent can be dictated by the
manufacturer as well so there's a lot of
things they can do but it is ultimately
made by other people as everything is in
this industry for the most part until
you get down to base supplier level even
though these radiators they're bought
from often other companies from
suppliers of radiators not from liquid
cooling companies so yeah that's it we
have another video on how the looking
coolers are made if you want to watch
that but we'll wrap this one here thank
you for watching if you want to pick up
the mod mats I was working on they are
anti-static mod mats they they're a
great build service for protecting the
table you're working on and also very
water resistant as we've learned
regularly from these subscribe for more
you can get a store like Erin's access
net to pick up one of the mats I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
