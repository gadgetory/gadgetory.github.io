hardcore overclocking and today we're
gonna be talking about load line
calibration and I can't write very fast
so this is gonna be very painful
so load line calibration also known as
all C for short is a setting available
on basically all high-end motherboards
and most mid-range as well as I'm not
sure I don't use that many low on board
so I'm not sure if it's most or some but
basically if your motherboard supports
overclocking it should probably have
load line calibration settings now load
line calibration settings are not the
most important thing until you're in a
situation where you can absolutely max
out the core voltage for your CPU pretty
much so you're on a cooling system that
can handle the maximum safe voltage
force for your CPU if you're on a weaker
cooling system you basically don't have
to care about this because v droop is
there to protect you before getting to
that this coverage is brought to you by
EVGA and on video with the destiny to
1080 Ti bundle a 1080i SC to comes with
a synchronous fan control for its dual
fans and nine thermal sensors and again
includes destiny to learn more at the
link in the description below
so let's actually talk about well the
droop doesn't really have any negative
impacts on you unless you're like
starting to push up against the edge of
max safe voltage and we'll go you'll see
why that is very soon before we get into
that we need to define something so
first of all what what on earth is what
is load line calibration well it's made
up of load line and calibration and the
load line is this magical thing which is
actually it like it's not actually like
a physical it's not a physical
phenomenon or anything it's a V Group
specification basically it looks like
like if you have a graph where one line
is current one side is voltage there
would be zero that right here is your
load line that's that's a load line yeah
and you might be wondering what on earth
does that mean well it's a simple way of
defining a V droop sort of adaptive V
core like an adaptive voltage V droop
system very simply because essentially
as your current increases your voltage
decreases so if you're at idle and the
vrm is outputting only 10 amps you might
be at like you know say at this point on
the line and none of this will be on to
scale and that point might be 1.3 volts
right and vid might be 1.35 like here
vid at this point is pretty special
because it's vid equals V core at that
point but then you turn you know you
start doing some intensive rendering or
something and you go to this point over
here that point is at say 60 amps but
that's realistic for full load and your
voltage might drop down to one point to
four volts which these are completely
arbitrary figures but you get the idea
here
well actually it would be more realistic
if it was 1.25 volts and what you're
seeing here is if because I decided that
vid is gonna be like that up there is
gonna be one point three one volts and
essentially this means that you have a
load line of 1 million because for 60
amps you're getting 60 millivolts of
droop so this is a way for Intel to
define how much your voltage core
voltage should be decreased at increased
current levels and you might be
wondering like why on earth would you
want to lower the voltage as the CPU
goes under load well one it makes sure
that the CPU uses less power so you stay
within TDP 2 it puts less strain on the
vrm because the CPU uses less power 3 it
keeps you in voltage tolerance levels
which is actually the main reason why
this is done because as some CPUs and
everything is just like well CPUs got a
finer and finer manufacture
processes they get more and more voltage
sensitive and Intel's also been like
pumping up the you know the efficiency
has been going up as well so load line
load line has been used to basically
make sure that all of that works as well
as possible and the voltage tolerance
thing is basically comes down to this
scenario if you have voltage here and
this lower graph will be current and
we're looking at these over time you
might see something that looks like your
current level might go like that and
you're gonna see a voltage graph that
looks like and we're gonna say we have
like an oscilloscope here so very
accurate measuring tool and then you're
gonna see a big voltage dip and then
you're gonna see increased ripple until
you get to the point where the VR like
the current draw drops off at which
point you're gonna get a voltage spike
some ringing and then returned ripple to
pre you know to this level of ripple and
so load line you know having the load
line allows Intel to basically grab this
entire section right here take all of
that and you know they want that the
core out erm output voltage never
exceeds this level right this is the
voltage you must never exceed so they
can grab this entire chunk here which is
going slow like it's going out a spec
here and they can just drag it down so
that your because if you looked at your
deep like if you had a multimeter on
this right you would see us flatline
because this this would be the average
right so you'd be seeing an average
voltage that's completely flat and then
if but with load line you would see
something that looks like this in terms
of average voltage right and and this
dip down here basically would take this
spike and push it down as well as also
push all of these spikes down so if
actually you know if this
line over here that I drew was lower
these bikes would also go within
tolerance because now your average
voltage is lower and your vrm is trying
to actually is aiming for a lower
voltage output and your ripple is now in
spec and you're not overshooting as hard
so that's why load line exists now we're
going to talk about why it's actually
really annoying and why the load line
calibration setting is so helpful when
overclocking because well is it's rather
simple right imagine this scenario we
have a CPU a I seven we have an i7 for
790 K why I chose that one and now let's
go modern you have an i7 77 and no more
modern 8700 K I like my upgrades and six
cores so you have your i7 8700 K alright
and the maximum voltage recommended for
this is one point four five volts and so
you decide that you're gonna set your
and you have you have the CPU deal it it
you have a giant water cooling loop and
you decide that okay I'm gonna go and
well actually you wouldn't even need a
giant water cooling loop if it's deleted
but it's deleted and you have a good
good cooling system on top of it and you
decide that yeah I'm gonna run one point
four or five volts through the CPU so
you set your voltage setting which on
most motherboards would just be the vid
you set that to one point four or five
volts so you set that to one point four
five and then you get a voltage reading
of you get V core will have actual V
core readings here and I'm sorry that I
didn't prepare tables for this but I
think it makes sense to just draw it out
like that
well I don't know if it makes sense like
this I don't know anything about video
production so deal with it I'm here to
teach you about load line not how to be
a good presenter so you have your vade
you have your idle and you have your
load B core and your idle v core on
stock load line well actually
let's add the LLC right load line
calibration would be stock then you have
your record levels and here you have
idle and here you have load right an
idle you'd be seeing say one point four
four five volts and you wouldn't
actually see one point four five because
remember the only time you would ever
see one point four five is if you're you
know if you're at zero amps current
output since you're not at zero amps
current output there's gonna be a little
bit of droop right so you're drooping a
little bit off of that one point four
five volts target now you go and you
start up the render and your voltage
drops all the way down to one point
three five volts that's atrocious that's
terrible you know that significantly
limits how much you can overclock your
cpu because your voltage that defines
your max overclock is this right this is
what limits your maximum overclock now
if you're on a weaker cooling system
that can't actually cool one point four
five volts this is great this is awesome
because you can idle on one point four
you can idle on just under one point
four or five volts all day and then you
go under full load and you're at one
point three five volts so the heat
output of your CPU isn't high enough to
actually overload your etes overload
your eat sink but and and you know you
might complain about the high idle
voltage but if you just enable C States
and like there's a few automatic power
saving settings if you just leave them
turned on it won't like your idle your
idle voltage won't be that high as well
as your idle clock won't be maxed out
all the time and when you go under like
light load where you need full CPU speed
it will go up to all the way up to this
but it won't be like idle idle
it'll be like mid load or medium load or
lightish loads so this would be
perfectly fine if you know your your
heat sink can't actually cool more than
one point three five volts but we just
established that our cooling system here
is not the issue so we need to go fix
this cuz
this is severely limiting our overclock
to only 4.9 gigahertz which really isn't
that rare most of these chips should be
hitting over that I actually know wait a
minute
4.8 gigahertz it's limiting us 4 to 4
point 8 GHz which this is not high
enough 8700 Kay's should regularly hit 5
gigahertz if you can push 1 point 4 2
volts into them so we're gonna throw
some LLC at it 1 point 4 or 5 volts and
we're gonna set our LLC to flat because
I've not well there's a few motherboards
out there like really good or extreme
overclocking motherboards are starting
to come out with LLC settings I can
actually get you basically completely
flat voltage output but most
motherboards can't do flat but let's say
you get a motherboard that does flat and
now you're getting one point 4 or 5
volts idle one point 4 5 volts load and
you're getting your 5 gigahertz awesome
great so this is why you want your low
you know why you need the load line
calibration setting now the problem is
this right here not realistic
ok I'm like I've tested a lot of
motherboards well okay not that many I'm
not a full-time motherboard reviewer but
I have used a lot of motherboards and
I've not seen a lot of motherboards
where your voltage does this like this
is really rare usually what you actually
see is what you actually see in terms of
actual load lines that you would see
here is just an example graph so if you
looked into a BIOS for for some
motherboard right you would see
something like stock so that would be s
then say low medium and then you know
this is what we'd want this is our flat
this is what we're aiming for and then
you get high
hi LLC gives you just the smallest
amount of boost and then you get very
high gives you even more boost and then
you get extreme and most motherboards
with an extreme LLC setting go way out
of whack and basically the end result is
like if you were to set one point four
or five volts and then put the LLC to
extreme you end up in a situation where
you're idling on say one point four
seven volts because remember you're
never at zero your you might be
somewhere up here on the curve right at
idle and then you go to full load and
you're here on that line and when you go
to full load you suddenly get one point
five seven bolts right
that kills chips that's really bad you
don't want to be running that into your
CPU long-term at all right if this was a
workstation and you configured your and
the funny thing is this would probably
let you run 5.1 gigahertz right it would
actually allow you to run a higher
frequency it might even let you do 5.2
in some cases so you have this 5.1
gigahertz overclock you think you have
it at one point four or five volts but
the reality of the situation is is
you're getting one point four seven
volts at idle and then you're getting
one point five seven volts at under full
load and if this was a you know as I
said a work machine where you know you
render video on it for a couple hours
everyday you can say bye-bye to that CPU
in like six months in six months that
CPU is no longer gonna be able to run
5.1 Giga Hertz at one like it's not
gonna like you're you're gonna lose that
five point one gigahertz overclock
you're probably gonna lose the ability
to do five gigahertz at one point four
five volts completely as well you might
end up in a situation where your CPU
goes from one you know one point four
five load and 5 gigahertz to four point
eight you know so that would cause
degradation if you decided to keep that
like if you just lowered your frequency
and kept the
insane LLC setting overtime it would
probably just straight-up destroy the
CPU to the point where it doesn't run at
all and unfortunately there is no really
good way of knowing uh well some other
boards you'll get lucky and they'll have
a good software voltage readout and then
there's some other boards where the
software voltage readout is completely
idiotic and I don't know what it's doing
okay and that that makes things very
very difficult and overall I would say
if you know if you don't have the
necessary skills and knowledge on how a
motherboard works and how to takes
voltage measurements on a motherboard
don't go above medium LLC just don't
because once you go above medium LLC
things tend to like these days more
modern motherboards I've noticed aren't
that bad even like surprisingly cheap
ones I haven't noticed one where the
extreme LLC was this extreme but in the
past I have run into motherboards where
extreme LLC was well pretty damn extreme
and completely unsafe for normal
operation as a result and I've never
really run into any motherboard where
the medium sighting would be this rich
like this stupid right it wouldn't be
unsafe levels of over voltage under full
load it wouldn't even know and typically
it would droop you a little bit and in
my personal testing and everything if I
am doing any kind of overclocking for
daily usage and I do actually have full
voltage measurements for the motherboard
then I'll still intentionally set up the
system to droop a little bit so you know
I might go for a one point four five
volts medium and then I get one point
four five idle because you know medium
LLC is starting to get to that point
where we're almost at that flat flat
line like that that's not actually a
realistic medium I've seen mediums that
look like that basically though again it
depends on what kind of skin
we have if this was 400 amps here then
the scale is that that extreme is not
extreme enough probably but you know so
medium LLC and then it would just droop
down gently to say one point four three
volts and this is something I would run
daily no problem that this is like this
is pretty much ideal at that point I've
actually lowered the core voltage a
little bit so that we get that you know
one point four two which is where most
8700 case would hit five gigahertz
anyway so you know it's just it's a kind
of a an interesting topic load line
calibration is but generally yeah my
recommendation is if you're overclocking
and your motherboard has load line
calibration settings set it to medium
like set it to the middle level like on
an asrock motherboard you'll have levels
that go one two three four five on as
rocker boards I recommend two and three
this one like it's not as bad as like
what I've drawn out here
I tested one but it does give you a
little bit of overshoot if you are on
ROG boards which I think they go like
one two three four five six seven
I would keep myself around while this
range and actually I think they go up to
eight but yeah you should always stay
around the middle levels gigabyte
motherboards always just stick to medium
extreme LLC on those is a well extreme
let's put it that way and yeah
MSI boards I can't currently remember
what their naming scheme is but
generally just stay around the middle
ground if you do know what you're doing
then you know knock yourself out
configure the LLC to give you completely
flat lap voltage if you can figure out
how to do that but under most scenarios
you should be you know four asrock you
should be looking at around two three
level aces four five gigabyte medium and
as a well MSI I can't like
can't remember right now I think medium
as well for them there's really no need
for the using the higher levels though
if you can find reliable information on
the internet like there are I think
turbo recently did a review of a bunch
of low-end Z 370 motherboards and he
actually went and measured what kind of
voltages the various LLC's will get you
so if you can get that kind of
information then actually just use that
information to figure out what LLC
settings you want to run but if you
don't know stick to the sort of middle
ground because that's the safest because
if you run like you know if you
unknowingly shove 1.5 7 volts into your
Mo's CPU well you're not gonna have a
CPU very long so you know that that is a
that's basically what you need to keep
in mind with LLC if you're not bumping
up against the Mac's safe voltage of
your CPU I would straight-up recommend
against messing with LLC at all because
ultimately you know as long as you're
not going over Mac's safe voltage at
idle you don't have to worry about about
the droop that much right because as
long as it's true because you know if
your cooling system is not capable of
handling over like if your cooling
system wasn't capable of handling over
1.3 5 volts well this this configuration
right here works great for you sure your
idle voltage is a bit high but it's not
like that's gonna kill it like that's
not dangerous this is this is really
really dangerous this is this is
perfectly normal
actually that's why it's called stock
sense how intel configures their CPUs
out of the box pretty much except of
course this voltage would be a lot lower
but you know it's uh it is that kind of
situation now obviously if you had a
cooling system that was good for 1.4 and
not good for 1.4 you know that then
you'd have to set like 1.5 and then it
gets a bit dicey but uh you know I
personally would recommend just
on the safe side and even then just
stick to medium and you might be
wondering like why can't we just use
software readings I've run into
motherboards where like the software
readings are just like a cool like miles
away from reality there are motherboards
where the software voltage readings are
very accurate and you can rely on them
and then there's motherboards out there
where the software might as well be
reading I like I don't know a mile just
pulling numbers out of thin air pretty
much it's really bad on some other
boards and on those boards you know is
like if those have LLC settings and pray
that you you don't that the medium
setting is actually medium and not
extreme because you're like yeah there
there's just no way to to know for sure
that you're not gonna destroy your chip
so yeah that's pretty much that pretty
much covers I think what you need to
know about load line calibration I think
I've actually gone a bit overboard
uh-hum but I think you get the idea
right load line calibration is well the
load line is Intel's way of specifying
adaptive CPU adaptive voltage for their
V RMS it is done to basically help with
will voltage tolerance on V RMS because
you don't get actual flat out line
voltage output you get spikes and ripple
and you want to keep that below your
maximum voltage tolerance and load line
and load line calibration the actual
load line calibration setting allows you
to adjust the load line from the stock
setting to be closer to completely flat
and under ideal and my recommended
setting would be something that droops a
little bit under low don't go up a bit
under load that's just no droop a little
bit always safer it's always safer if
your voltage is going down and going up
if it's going up then you know you might
have a very bad day one day if it's
going down unless your idle voltages
for hi you're gonna be fine so yeah
that's it for load line calibration I
hope you learned something I hope it
made sense no I don't know how
successful I was on that part I hope I
protect your CPU from extreme LLC though
there are some other boards where
extreme LLC doesn't actually work
properly but again it's just not worth
the risk in my opinion so that's it for
