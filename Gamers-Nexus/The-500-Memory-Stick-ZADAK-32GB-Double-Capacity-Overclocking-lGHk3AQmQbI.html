Samsung's reached volume production on
its 32 gigabyte ddr4 you dibs and so the
company instead designed a new double
capacity dim standard this isn't a JEDEC
standard but it is a standard that has
gotten some attention from Zadok and
from g.skill both of whom have made some
of the tallest memory modules the world
has ever seen
these DIMMs are 32 gigabytes per stick
so 2 of them would give us 64 gigabytes
at 3200 megahertz and after an
overclocking average some pretty good
timings 2 of these sticks would cost you
about $1,000 with the 36 hundred
megahertz options at around $1,300 today
we'll be looking into when they can be
used and how well they can overclock
before that this video is brought to you
by coarser and it's void Pro headset the
void Pro headset is available in wired
or Wireless versions with the wireless
option supporting a boosted range
upwards of 30 to 40 feet the headset has
full RGB LEDs on the ear AQAP's has 50
millimeter headphone drivers and lasts
up to 16 hours on battery
it can also be plugged in for Wired at
use and is now lower in price than when
it first launched a noise cancelling
microphone is also included along with
an easy mute indicated by an LED and you
can learn more at the link in the
description below as for what it is this
is a double capacity dim it's not an
official standard it's an Asus designed
standard and only two memory
manufacturers presently supported so
this stick about $500 for just this one
but it's 32 gigabytes so that's a lot 16
gigabytes per side it's difficult to do
this it has to be done by making the PCB
taller which obviously creates all kinds
of clearance concerns also a lot of
signal integrity concerns turns out it's
not so easy to just add more and more
memory to a chip or to a PCB because at
some point you have trace length issues
you have signal integrity issues and
also you have issues with motherboards
supporting it at all in fact we don't
even quite understand how this works
because Asus and Zadok aren't presently
disclosing the deeper details on it as
it presumably Asus thinks it gives them
a competitive advantage although the
market for this is so small that they
might as well really just
is everything because no one's buying
them anyway but there might be some very
very specific use cases for this and
we'll tell you why as we go through but
either way this is not an easy thing to
make and it does allow you to
theoretically max out the memory
controller on the cpu intel has
validated the 9900 Kay it's work without
and 28 gigabytes of memory the challenge
is getting that much memory in four
slots and these only work presently in
motherboards with two slots so that's
where we get some hints as to what's
going on the other downside is that it's
presently an Asus designed memory spec
which nearly guarantee is limited
adoption issues itself only has three
motherboards that presently support the
DC dims we tried using them with our
Maximus 11 hero with four slots for
standardized benchmarking but found that
it won't even boots only the Z 390 I at
Mini ITX gaming board the gene and the
apex which is the one we used support DC
memory the Z 390 IB and Mini ITX is one
of the more meaningful use cases of
populating two slots with higher
capacity dims than would otherwise be
possible the apex and gene are also
limited to only two slots two slot one
DPC designs can be useful for extreme
overclocking by simplifying the memory
traces and allowing higher overclock on
the memory when it's closer to the CPU
but we don't commonly see extreme
overclocking overlapping with high or
ultra-high memory capacities in fact in
a lot of xoc instances max mem is set in
Windows to get better timings this is
already an extremely limited use case
then it's $800 starting for the lowest
frequency of the dims by is a DAC and G
schools around the same starting price
so if you're using a motherboard with
four slots one you can't use these so
rule that out too you could get 64
gigabytes of memory which is what this
is for a thousand bucks
at 3200 megahertz for in the range of
400 to 600 80 dollars depending on the
timings you go for and the memory market
so let's call it 500 it's about half the
price of these DC modules which is
obviously going to really restrict the
market for these because if you really
need memory capacity
main stream platform for some reason
because that's all these work on they
don't work on X 299 then you might as
well buy four sticks 64 gigabytes for
half the price
but there is one restriction to that
which is if you really really want to
use the gene the apex or more reasonably
you want a mini ITX built maybe you're
doing a mini ITX rendering system of
some kind maybe a blender system
whatever that you take for travel and
you really need 64 gigabytes of memory
there's a use case there will concede
there's a use case there it's it's a
very small one but it exists technically
so for sake of pure capacity you would
be better off going with a board that
has more slots and just buying cheaper
memory but in theory if at some point
this could be done and it won't be any
time soon but if this could be done in a
way that you have DC dims in more than
two slots then okay now we can talk more
about where these are useful
unfortunately the way these work as far
as we know is one stick detects as two
sticks so that's going to limit that
possibility of going with four sticks
using the memory on the apex we noticed
in hardware info reports that there are
four sticks populating the board but I
said earlier the board itself only has
two slots available there's some
trickery going on here to spoof the
memory into working in this board and
part of that is done by telling it that
each module is two sticks worth of
memory we're not quite sure exactly
what's happening here and it's not being
disclosed presently taking the memory
apart wasn't difficult but not
particularly easy either there are only
a few screws holding each does a DAC
module together but the thermal pads are
more of a thermal adhesive they're
really stuck on there and removing them
requires some finesse to not rip off the
memory modules underneath we see two
rows of Samsung memory across a couple
of columns one set on each side
this is Samsung's k4a eight g0h 5wb - B
CPB memory solution which is an eight
gigabit module there
eight bits in a byte so we end up with
16 gigabytes of memory per side on these
sticks we ran a few tests on a 99
hundred K at Jeff's 4.9 gigahertz all
core our tests were focused entirely on
determining where the memory gains could
be seen when overclocking these were
mostly with times by extreme physics as
the software is extremely responsive to
memory latency and timing changes this
is something we've seen in our
overclocking streams firsthand where a
single timing can change the results by
hundreds of points of scoring greases we
also ran some Cinebench tests although
the software doesn't care about timings
and so it doesn't really scale and we
did some tasks with maximum which we'll
put in the article in the description
below this table on the screen shows
some of our tuning steps our end results
had us at 34 66 megahertz up from 3200
with 1.5 volts T RFC at 300 then 274 T
RFC to 256 40rc TR f c3
we tried to lower the TRF see settings
further but we ended up with lower
performance and eventually blue screens
or instability we dropped T fr for for
active window 222 for now with primary
timing stable at 14 14 14 34 we maxed
out TR efi for better performance in
3dmark and we set raster ass delays to
for cke to 6 and tuned some of the
tertiary timings manually but leftmost
alone here's a chart for some
visualization of those results our
results with XMP only had us at about 49
20 to 49 30 points for TSE physics with
a 34 66 megahertz overclock and no other
changes to timings Landing us at 51 38
points all the steps in between are also
on this chart as you can see in the
middle clump of the results but the
final results had us at 54 89 to 50 508
points a climb of about 12% in total CPU
score these chips actually overclocked
pretty well they're not extreme
overclocking memory modules so if that's
what you want you should still buy
something else but they do overclock
really not that bad for something that's
so capacity focused so that was nice to
see let's I guess talk through the
conclusions here overclocking is not bad
I guess that's something it only works
on three boards at present apex gene and
then z3 90i gaming which is the more
interesting you
case because at two slots you can
actually kind of start to argue this
this scenario where you're occupying the
only two slots on the board with the
maximum amount of memory possible until
the higher density memory modules become
available to mass-market so that's
really the use case it's super portable
mini ITX rendering machine where you
just you're having trouble getting high
density dims because they don't exist or
something and you have to go with this
and then you also of course have to
build around this because it's gigantic
and so CLC is probably the best choice
in that instance as well just to make
sure everything fits together these let
us get closer to maxing out the memory
controller on the isie 390 main stream
desktop CPUs which intel has validated
up to 128 gigabytes on the 9900 K so
that's kind of cool the X 299 dark would
be an interesting scenario for this as
well these don't work in it
unfortunately but the reason that would
be interesting is because it's 4 slots
and the platform supports 8 so if you
could get four of these in there you
have a super high end overclocking board
plus really high capacity and those are
things that are kind of rare to put
together so that's sort of it doesn't
work so it doesn't work speculating
about how fun it would be but that would
be a scenario as well these are roughly
1.5 X the power consumption of a normal
dim of a normal stick but not a big deal
really at the end of the day and they
are very very small use cases they are
extremely expensive and basically an
interesting project with limited use
cases so most people in our audience
shouldn't buy this but there's probably
a few people out there a few of you who
are excited about this and if you are
one of them please post a comment below
and let everyone know what you would
like to do with these we would imagine
the most common use case would be a z3
90i gaming a mini ITX build something
focused on very system memory intensive
type of processing but you have to
travel with it and that's why it's mini
ITX otherwise you might as well just Big
D go with a bigger
Desktop and then more memory modules so
that's kind of where we see the use case
for this but overclocking is good so job
well done Samsung and Zadok on that the
heat sinks are more than sufficient you
really don't need to worry about
thermals on memory for the most part all
of these get a bit warmer than normally
and it's expensive so that's all for
this one kind of an interesting thing to
play with but that's about where it ends
for us thank you for watching as always
subscribe for more you can go to store
documents access net to pick up one of
our mod mats the large and the medium
version are both being restocks they are
