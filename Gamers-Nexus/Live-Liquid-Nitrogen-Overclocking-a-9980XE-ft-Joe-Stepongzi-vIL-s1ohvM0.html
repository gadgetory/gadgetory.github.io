know let me know for live I think we are
though and it's just gonna take a second
for the window to update for everybody
watching so I'm joined by Joe step on Z
who is with me for the video we just
uploaded and he should open that in a
new tab and cue it up if you haven't
seen it for sure after the stream let me
know if it was good and all that stuff
audio and video are coming through fine
and and then we can kind of start
talking about what we're doing today so
I did see someone say I did see someone
say we're finally gonna see build Zoid
IRL and and Joe had a response for that
yeah I ate him yes yes deltoid is not
here no the previous the previous video
Joe was with me for that and we so we
did a video at the Intel event right yep
and I know it's while people are filling
in to chat I guess give kind of a primer
what's what's your history with
overclocking how long have you been
doing it probably about a decade now ten
years so I mostly do 3d but I've been
kind of expanding I did the 9900 kay
release for Intel up at the World Trade
Center it was pretty badass oh yeah yeah
pretty good stuff yes it was it was
pretty sweet so except they had the blue
light that was shining on him and man we
couldn't white balance for it so yeah so
that was a little difficult something
think about Intel alright so yeah we're
working with a 99 in Exe today and this
is I think we're probably gonna end up
doing like sort of start to finish
lnto overclocking so we'll apply the
Allen to pot we'll walk through like
some of the processes of pouring and
overclocking and then I I think
unfortunately Joe has instructed me that
he is not going to win my battles for me
so you do everything for you so yeah so
I'm gonna be on my own there but we're
gonna go kind of as far as reasonable
today and then I'll take that experience
and we can hopefully do some more of
this stuff in the future - oh would that
about it so to rip their Bower in the
future
although heat era if he actually tries
it might be a little harder nah we gotta
show any American engineering that's
right yes to counter his what is his
trademark slogan German perfected German
engineer you ever see their Bauer at
Gamescom or something make fun of him
for that yeah it's quite a he he also
thinks it's so funny hilarious actually
they roll with it anyway alright so
super chats are open if you want to
support us during the stream you can
send a super chat there you can also go
to store now cameras axis tonight to
pick up some stuff like for example
Archon from you'll mugs which we filled
Jo's got one now two but we filled this
with Allen's who last night and it was
actually pretty sweet do not drink it if
you put Alan two in it but you can put
Alan to in it and you can probably like
laugh the bottom and use it as a like a
65 watt CPU ln2 pot there we should have
tried that we'll have to do that in
future days yeah that would look
definitely cool yeah so you can grab
that on stored I can recycle starting
that and I think we will do some other
stuff to you throughout the stream first
two super chats PRC point let's cut the
blimp APR Captain Planet thank you 750
MT don't noob enough Joe go a team Joe's
mom yeah it's a funny story so I used to
vent to a teammate you all the time and
they came up with team Joe's mom it was
great they all came up with shirts I'm
still waiting for my shirt by the way
still never got one of those
get on it yeah for real John bender $5
get this man a breather so he doesn't
need their Barrett to think I'm kind of
hungry and see one more before we kind
of start out here ads are on ad sauron
$4.99 over watch it needs a mapmaker
okay yeah I can't help you hon sorry
that Blizzard Ron streams with foot
hahaha all right so we've got 1,500
people loaded into chat and I don't know
well let's let's start out with what
Alan to pot yeah they're walking through
the actually let's just walk through
what everything is first yeah so we do
have some Ellen to paws on table this is
this is Romans is the Beast
we're not gonna use this today but I I
intend to use this when I get going on
my own so I'll be using this at some
Iori isn't was drawers t-rex has a
kingpin cool in tier X so that's
kingpins yeah
there we go that's I think you said
that's like an early model yeah this is
like an es model so this is not really
the same so you could look inside but
it's not really what you're gonna get so
right it's kind of my pot so and then
we're not using these today but they are
cool so I'll show these off these are
the what was the model name for the
other the tec-9 fatty by kingpin okay
King been cooling as evidenced by the
tec-9 on the no on the the pot so these
are four GPUs like I said not using
these today we we kind of have enough
going on with just one Allen to pop
since I'm just starting so and we don't
have the Magellan TV there yeah
fun fact everybody I've spoken to I
didn't tell you this yet everyone I've
spoken to when they were like where did
you get the Ellen to people in the
industry
I said air gas and all of them laughed
yes so air guys delivered our Ellen's
who container leaky and Alan to empty a
lot but yeah I think think we lost like
40 liters or something but yes we do
have enough for the stream that's where
okay we are gonna be a bit conservative
but other than that I mean you've got a
lapped 99 80 XE here so I'm very pretty
yeah so I mean laughing process I think
it's pretty obvious why you do this but
you want to walk through yeah usually
what I do is a so I'm these chips
especially since they're soldered it
seems like the the chip itself kind of
gets a little bit of worked so what I do
is send it off so that way I can meet
the pot so that way you can be pretty
perfect when you've set it on the chip
that way we and we don't have any cold
issues or it just works pretty well so
yet it has as flat as possible for a
contact very very very very flat so we
like to kill or not kill nine your name
you're not killing that knock Tilly 99
yes yeah ideal yes yes so let's super
chats any of those come in yes tariffs
Eve two dollars what CPU is it Joe
doesn't know about this meme I don't
think for whatever reason our Chad
decided what CPU is it was gonna be the
thing they do to bother me with during
streams because when we did the 79 80 XE
I think ya stream everybody kept asking
what CPU is it because people kept
joining yeah and they kept asking what's
your name nice you know what if you want
to ask that you're just you're gonna
have to send a super chat it like you're
gonna have to pay me to answer that at
this point it's just advertising for
Intel yeah sure it is not the stuff hits
the 99 80 XE this time
whiskey Omega is 4k came in five dollars
thank you very much whiskey Omega and
good to see here
UK represent nice to do a stream that
that isn't too late here yes we are much
earlier than normally and then dragged
Seoul gaming $5 did you see my email
forwarded by the store support about
g-sync monitors there are a lot of
defective ones that that they won't fix
or replace no but I will look I'll check
I'll check for g-sync monitors and my
inbox after this and see what you're
talking about because I am NOT up to
date on that so thank you for the news
tip that will look into it okay what
what next you've got a torch from
outdoor channel so this the they care
anyway you you were using this yesterday
just to heat up the pot I guess right
well I torched the bought a little bit
to get a better interaction with it
right when you're pouring liquid
nitrogen but I also do it if you need to
heat it up if you had cold bugger right
boot bug or anything like that
yes it was very helpful for when I think
we thought the pace might have cracked
yeah we heated up and it's I sort of
leave reflow the paste or something yeah
basically that cold minus 100 the pace
seemed like it wasn't working too well
so we ended up heating it up to about
plus 20 C and right with the torch so we
got a say we had a some normal chats
Robert D in chat
what gigahertz are you guys aiming for I
don't know if we really have a goal Wow
actually probably five six at least five
six at Leon first restart six and maybe
with a VX about five for mmm-hmm
what about a we might just do normal
times by it to get it a bit higher and
non extreme yeah
or Geekbench or whatever yeah doesn't
okay either way where can we get the
buted hardware shirts I'm still actually
dealing my manufacturers on how to get
them but they will be coming soon
so if you just check out my channel
though yeah let me grab my way over to
your channel - this is you I'm gonna
post a I'm gonna update the description
of the stream with a link to the hit to
his channels while bearded hardware so
Joe is just launching this channel right
yep and well relaunch I want to do it
before but so another fine joe's channel
here alright so that is updated in the
description hopefully that doesn't break
the stream and okay what when I guess I
we got we have the ice bucket pack this
this is my doing haha so Joe came in and
was like what are you doing with all
those paper towel but this is insulation
overkill I guess you could never go but
yeah I mean the concern is I paid for
those oh yeah so we have to tighten our
t axes with they're insulated they have
water blocks on them if you saw the
previous video we sort of set it up
there this runs to the mora 3 radiator
which is a water cool product I don't
remember what this costs but water cool
makes them really high-end liquid
cooling parts like this one so this is
functionally a car radiator in size
though though they'll get them out of me
if I call it a car right yeah cuz it's
all like custom-made and so it they well
it's probably better to be honest yeah
and then we're gonna fill this with ice
in a bit we we use some Allen to to
refreeze the water last night and that
helped when we're being lazy but
slacking
yeah so there's that no pot on the
motherboard right now this is what is
180 liter tank it was supposed to be a
surprise 321
basically we use this transfer hose
which these I learned last night are
very expensive yeah it was like hoses
are usually yes 200 or a similar one to
this 260 bucks when I went to buy one
last night and we just used this to
transfer it into the Dewar the tip you
had for me was kind of keeping a hand on
it while you're filling that first so
that it doesn't like fly up and hit you
in the face yeah fun fact one time I
ended up opening it up and it's almost
hit me in the face man of breaking a big
giant glass door smashing everywhere
it's kind of at a at a hardware
manufacturer cielab that was me so
that's the tank it is it's much lighter
now just to give you an idea for how
heavy liquid nitrogen is because I had
no idea this was difficult for me to do
yesterday and yeah and it's it's so it's
a little heavier than water per gallon
so and then this is 30 liters which Joe
is better equipped to lift than I am
okay you want some oh yeah I think Joe
does that with one hand but pretty much
showoff
yeah I was trying not to make it was bad
didn't work so that's the Dewar do you
want to tell me why like what this is
why it's special I don't know if you
guys have ever seen Yeti cups or
anything but it's an insulated Dewar so
basically you have liquid nitrogen and
sealed inside so that way you get no
condensation on the out outside this
will basically protect it and are not
protected but keep it so it doesn't
evaporate for a long period of time yes
so so what is the kind of a I mean if we
filled this and we just walk away from
it how long till you think it's all gone
this one usually because of the top so
lick liquid nitrogen just builds
pressure naturally so if you have a
decent to bad topic this one can last
probably about two weeks no problem
that's not bad
yeah just with just little evaporate
right but better than nothing
yeah it's got a sticker on it that says
hiss you hear is normal which to some
extent is true because it does need a
pressure release yeah would but not all
day yes yeah we should note that too in
terms of I mean safety Allen's who is is
fairly safe overall that can be a little
dangerous like that if it doesn't have a
pressure yeah good technically smoke
right right which is definitely gonna be
careful for yeah and then pouring so I
learned yesterday that it getting it on
skin actually doesn't hurt all that much
no you can as long as basically the
method I use is about soaking if you if
you don't soak something then it's not
that dangerous right you gotta be kind
of kick you still got to be careful but
as long as you're just like kind of just
rinsing off it's kind of like water so
if you just splash a little bit it's not
gonna do much but as soon as you soak
something that's when you can get
dangerous like clothes like if you get
it here yeah yeah everywhere socks and
you drop a bunch on the ground yeah for
and over yeah that kind of hurts alright
and I burned it the funny thing is it
kind of burns exactly like hot does you
know like if you were to take this torch
and burn yourself mm-hmm
it's very similar yeah yeah so with
these we didn't talk about these at all
these are like it's just sort of
thermoses yeah nothing special with
these I mean you get them at any store
for cab in these ones I think I I got at
Target yeah yeah so one of them has like
a metal handle though and yeah I learned
yesterday when I was transferring that
holding it by the metal part of the
handle if you get Ellen to on there it
hurt it'll stick to your skin it does
not feel great I forgot to tell you that
yes you learned your lesson I learned
yeah not too bad though alright so let's
see what Oh
also you want to talk about so even with
liquid nitrogen in close spots you have
to be careful no basically it sucks out
the oxygen over time so you want to be
careful because you can pass out and
potentially die yeah so one of the ways
we actually test the see if there's
oxygen in the air is go like that if
your torch can't light then you need to
get some air in the room yes just a
little safety thing there if you're
gonna do liquid Nike I don't suspect
many people will be copying this at home
but if you do be aware of the
yes a fee obviously and then build Zoid
when he first was talking about Alan's
he overclocking he just said if you
start to feel dizzy you'll leave the
room - been there done that yeah because
if you pass out you might not get up so
but overall it is pretty safe you just
need to be aware of yeah it's not like I
get people that always ask to say oh is
it gonna blow up or is it gonna
flammable flammable and actually the
best one when people say it's like no I
could probably put a put a fire out with
it so alright so let's check the super
chats and stuff for a second
so we got a couple in we have Jeremy $2
volt Steve you seem super happy today
well I've got the overclocking celebrity
Joe Stefan's e with me so of course my
body Toronto works $5 tell Panasonic
that she is the best camera she's the
best camera sorry Andrew okay they
credit just the camera haha
you're the best camera but bazinga axe
two dollars which cpu that you say it
was joke's on you
you paid me two bucks to answer the head
thank you though for the support of
course it is the 99 80 XE and the one we
have in there presently is actually mine
the sample I have so it is not lapped
and I have some pretty big quarter core
Delta's which will not help us today but
but we're gonna use mine and see how far
it goes
max Samson $5 1080 and thank you very
much back still need to know if you got
snowflake an RCP caller no she does not
have an Archie B collar snowflake is
better than that thank you
and the yeah
I love you guys keep up the great stuff
thank you Scott clue low $5 there's no
message thank you
motorsport nej can see you again $5 I'm
a spare allen to face separator I'll
send an email maybe can save you some
money
okay sure send me an email I'm buying
stuff so that we may be interested
lauric $50 central North Carolina
represent good to see you central North
Carolina I'm sure you're somewhere here
otherwise that would be weird to say
our $5 but the results from today's
overclock apply towards rip J to know so
we are not doing rip J response here
this is just like me learn how to do L&amp;amp;T
overclocking we might not do x y extreme
for all of it either i just going to
kind of walk through the basics yeah
crawl before you walk around right see
how far it goes so we are not not
applying this towards rip J however if
we if we do end up beating Roman at some
point now or in the future most likely
in the future then I will I reserve the
right to apply that towards rip Roman or
rip their Bower I like that idea
yes and then he might actually try
instead of just flying the time line and
having Elmore do it all for us oh yeah
so I mentioned that we just mentioned
this before the stream Paul the the
bearded one downing is like ition like
it says where's the sign posters that
can't fight him on the store so I think
we were just talking about this just for
because this is kind of a special event
I know you want to sign the posters with
me we'll do some yeah some autographed
posters so if you grab them on the store
it's that one right there and you can
get a shot of it me without it we'll see
if the glares in there other guy has
been but it's a it's a video card
Anatomy poster so it's got like all the
components labeled if you want to know
what they are and Joe and I will sign
them I guess if you buy during the
stream and you can pick them up I don't
know write on them yet but the last time
I did this we did a rip ltte poster and
so we did it because I accidentally beat
Linus to score in like ten minutes ten
minutes
I meant to stretch it out for an hour
whoops so like half the posters were
like like hashtag repel DT oops yeah
oops is good
sorry Linus maybe we'll come up with
something good with this one yeah well
we'll see what happens and we'll figure
out what's wrong but if it's just the
normal posters have you just buy the
poster them during the stream has to be
during the stream and will sign them
before Joe goes back and of course
subscribe to his channel bearded
Hardware if you haven't already I linked
it in the description below okay so
let's get started with something
mountain Allen teapot sure
let's see obviously take your nice
ellentube I put it on so you've already
got the threaded rods on there yeah
pretty much actually oh just over that
real quick so I have threaded rods I
have a heater underneath basically just
some paper towels around we have some
foam insulation with Vaseline underneath
it so we're gonna be using Vaseline for
as the insulation
let me see I'm gonna get wrapped up
there and then these the the heater
so the socket heater it's not plugged in
right now I'll be what are you 15
right so what do you typically use that
for well it's to keep the setup nice and
dry mm-hmm so it helps to bench a little
bit longer depending on like what chip
you're using so I find with the bigger
platform especially when you're gonna do
a 3d it helps to keep the CPU benching
longer so right so that's it I usually
put it on about minus 50 and then pop it
off under minus 15 and then we've got a
lot of insulation so this is in the
video that's up if you haven't seen you
know it's on the channel cue it for
after the stream yeah but so
installation you did Vaseline all over
the board right yeah going back to
Vaseline to be honest I used to use
liquid electrical tape but it was just
tired of applying it all the time yeah
well we use the kneadable eraser and it
sucks that one's opinion yeah well to be
honest I think liquid electrical tape is
actually better than the original so but
it's in between I still can't stand
doing it but yeah so vaseline insulates
it I do ever do you bother cleaning it
when you're done or you just let it sit
I'm well you probably should after a
while I feel like you let Vaseline kind
of collects hair and dust right or you
know beard hair yeah yeah but yeah after
a while I want to wash it so you can
either do like what Roman does and throw
it in the dishwasher dishwasher or and
get your your girlfriend to help he
didn't even know what settings to get
they get hurt he is the Oh buddy
embodies our washing machine maybe we
should have done that video so you can
wash it off in there use you found a
ultra sonic yeah so Vince from kingpin
cooling yeah do they have a I don't know
it's kinda ingenious I can't believe we
haven't thought of it earlier to be
honest it's a cool the ultrasonic
cleaner so I think they use it for like
dentists and
a little different so you can actually
literally pop the board in there you and
just watch it and it literally does not
even take off the paste it just cleans
the board like it's brand-new okay
probably even better than the factory
that's what's crazy about it so yeah so
we need to get some of that I think yeah
and then bottom side so you've got some
just foam here I guess right yeah so
underneath the heater there's like a big
thermal pad you can buy oh my king fan
cooling it's the transfer the heat and
then underneath that is just basically
foam insulation so that way the board
sits on and there's obviously a whole
layer of Vaseline underneath there yes
right so yeah I guess most biggest
concern is protecting against water
dripping onto the board well it's not so
much dripping it's more of a pulling
okay if their water starts building up
around it can short stuff and then it
all of a sudden it will the board will
just start acting funky right you know
and it could also kill the board yeah
and you use that at the Intel event - oh
yeah I had a board die yeah yeah it's
bad insulation it was very the humidity
was very high though yeah we were
basically in a cloud also the the
restrictions in that building were not
too helpful yeah I was kind of a pain
they didn't let me do the torch yeah
yeah I have to get it is that how you
tried to convince them yeah we're
basically hiding this starts what do you
mean I can't do it yeah yeah no we're
like kind of like standing in between
like hiding it right and then a guy came
in he didn't like it that much
yeah they said they would shut down the
whole event if we didn't give them the
torches no or get him out of the
building okay I'm crazy but it's also
the World Trade Center so yeah you kind
of expect it yeah you can you can
believe that there's a good reason so
then these are m4 threaded rods and you
just have these in the socket where they
normally go I guess no they're blows
it's in the heater itself they so is it
you know Kay it's kind of so he used to
have like a just a metal plate so now he
just replaced it with a heater I see
okay and then it just screws right in
gotcha um anything else on the board
perhaps I'd that's most of it I think
that's most of it insulation around the
socket we have some of the foam that I
bought from kingpin around those just an
arm oh yeah it's basically armor flex
most people in the industry know what it
is hmm actually I think it's over here
yes
let me show ya it's a bunch of keys here
you can actually get it at Lowe's or
like any of the hardware here's a good
comment usually in a sea eating in chat
I've seen this one before I don't know
how to pronounce name like mich OSIS I'm
still puzzled why you guys don't use
conformal coating spray to exclude
condensation like most of the industry
well here's the thing so it's not that
we don't use it we actually do use it
but the problem is is to prep the board
it's kind of a pain hmm
you basically you want you can't have
conformal coating inside the memory
socket and you got a it's kind of just a
pain to apply it actually takes longer
than because you got to tape up the
board and be meticulous with it and then
if you ever want to resell the board or
anything or maybe put it in a daily
system it's kind of it doesn't work
right we're trying to do something
that's only temporary
that only stays there for a little bit
and not like for the life of the board
we have I I'm trying to find where this
thread started will Dan cop is in chat
Oh Daniel
oh my god and so Dan's in here somewhere
I haven't seen this message that I'm
scrolling off right now there Bauer's in
here actually hardcore overclocked ins
in here build Zoid yes all great people
you should follow them if you don't
builder it says bench meet in Germany to
take down all the 3d marks I don't know
if he's talking with a real mentor or we
should all go I'll go yeah should all do
it I don't think we're invited but I'll
go no we'll go anywhere we don't need an
invite oh yeah we've got a chat log I
can't we'll find out where they're
meeting that's right we'll find it
so hello to the real EXO seers Roman
you'll be sad to know I don't think
we're ripping you today but I'm I would
like to wait until we use URL on to pot
for that yeah we beat you with your own
pot it's better but yes they're bad if
you don't know who he is he's on YouTube
as well I should follow I'm bearded hard
we're here on YouTube build Zoids got a
channel actually hard for overclocking
and Dan cop is I'm sure out there
somewhere I'm not sure if he's on
YouTube where I think it is Facebook I
don't just Facebook yeah another
overclocker that you should follow all
of them okay so we've walked through the
whole board crap I'm sure all the XO see
you guys like
my god I know stop it get to something
interesting but this this I think is
interesting to a lot of our audience
yeah
well they know they've seen it before
many times actually so we're gonna mount
the bat and you have what do you have on
there cry or not yeah where'd you
where'd you gonna test it out so we're
gonna try out a thermal grizzly cry oh
not today for this one so Roman can you
know I figured we can quit crying yeah
well throw Roman a bone on this one I
have a lot of grizzly so might as well
use it it's good ideas good guy that's
really good I'm not some super chats
coming in while you're doing that sure
we got let's see we got Paul to be lucky
Barker $20 1018 no message thank you
lucky Zara's $5 no message thank yous
are us we appreciate it
Rodney law at $50 a novice PC enthusiast
here I really enjoyed Jen's informative
and balanced presentations well I
appreciate that this will be a little
bit I don't know we've got some good
information in here actually so far so
if you're into this kind of stuff then
you might be able to walk away knowing
enough to try it yourself
unlimited power 88 $10 thanks Steve for
the awesome livestream your channel
inspired me to build my 9900 Kay custom
system after a decade of mobile games
and the iPads keep up the great work and
iPads are I am if I have any any
position in doing that than I I'm glad
to take a great if you had welcome to PC
gaming or real enjoy it yeah thank you
for the Super chats guys and as I said
if you want a signed poster from the
street we don't know what will write on
it yet we'll figure it out based on what
goes wrong no go yeah but you can grab
one just sepia tone on posters on store
that gamers Nexus Don that and I'll try
them shout you out if you order one but
no guarantee is if we if we have too
much volume so you've got that mounted
night and now you're gonna insulate it
yeah so usually I just do a little snug
so that way the pot can move most people
ask me how hard do you put it up push it
down right my snug might be a little bit
different than yours just just saying
you
yeah and you also you want to be careful
of too much right yeah pressure when I
first was starting out my hands uh I got
a little carried away sometimes we crush
and Chitina crushing stuff yeah so you
got to be a little careful I think
there's a computer component yeah Jay
had a problem I've we've done this in
the past not for Allen too but for other
coolers where if you over tighten it
yeah it just won't boot and I don't know
if it's like a sensor or if it's just it
depends on the chip like so if you do
like say you take like a 6700 K like
there PCB is so thin it's like a potato
chip with bends you'll basically kill
the chip right ends up going like this
so with other ones it depends on the
board if you're going way too hard on
the board you're probably like
disconnecting some type of bug right
yeah so you have to be careful you don't
want to go to art as I liquid metal
looking I know I always actually nervous
huh it's okay
yeah we're good so we have liquid metal
on the shunts but there's it's this so
little of it it's like kind of dripping
so I wouldn't let me bottom this ball
yeah yes that is that is my fault
I'm fine with that maybe in the future
but we might actually want to reclaim
these for testing yes we've got liquid
metal on there now on the shunts it's at
this point it's been there for a while
and it's they've been moved around so I
thought were getting much more than an
extra like 3% performance out of India
but it's something I guess I've got a
store order from Jonathan and North
Carolina actually thank you Jonathan
won't take too long to get to you picked
up a video a signed poster much
appreciated and then let me read one
more here we got one from Behrend from
Deutschland who picked up a GPU poster
as well I feel like we're gonna be
signing a lot I didn't see any orders
from Roman though yeah I'm gonna
disappoint it I'll send you one for free
yeah there you go but when we actually
do a rip there by our stream later we
can we can sign a giant I do that for
Linus and we're gonna right across the
middle I wrote rip LTT sorry Linus and I
sent it to
did he post it and like show sensitivity
meters high
alright so why not the GPU on cold well
we're just gonna chill it with water for
now
I I mean we've got the Allen teapots
here but I was like you know let's see
how this goes first and then we can ask
my cards
yeah but number one two or not enough LM
- really yeah we don't have we would go
through l into that container probably
in 10 minutes all right
pars of all $2 we will give you 1,000
bucks if you cut your hair $2.00 isn't a
very convincing start and also you can
have to go way high yeah wait higher
right I wouldn't even take a thousand
that cut the beard come on man no way
takes too long yeah for real uh-uh
alright so you've got the pot mounted
what we don't there once do you want
full mis-advice but as well you might
want to do it because I tend to spill it
everywhere I don't know how that works
I'm the pro at a dice único it that part
ha ha
let me grab one I'm gonna do - yeah Oh
careful this one okay oh yeah no I drop
it just to kind of do it and it
basically exploded gosh I seem to have a
problem with ice it's fine something
just something fell down on it
all right so we just had like the cold
water this this stems from people in our
chat bag enough to add one ice cube to a
reservoir when we were overclocking and
tell Hades Canyon not because I was
having trouble getting like an extra 50
megahertz or something I wanted and so
everyone in chat side add an ice cube
what an ice cube yeah I think we
actually ended up doing it later to know
ice is actually it actually helped for
today it's ice but I don't know that
water I know what a nice Kiwis not gonna
wear your bright note
okay there's nothing to try you throw an
AC even anyone
yeah well if you put the AC unit in
submerge it to keep the pole and then
basically go through and do the same
setup but you need a bigger pool right a
lot of the guys used like pull material
and so one of those cool little tricks
we used to do back in the day some
really call the ice yeah
alright you got that pom-pom nope
the pond one Oh actually yeah it should
be on okay I'll check see so we have a
pond pump in here yes it's plugged in
yeah a testicular daughter gets the warm
water a bit away from the radiator
that's actually from Ritchie see he's
another
good idea too they want to add salt
we've done that I did that in the last
one lowers freezing with us all we have
by about 8 degrees maybe and I don't
know that it's really worth it compared
to what we did use not really yeah I
don't think so it's cuz it's hard to
know how much to add to and then the
problem is clean up clean up sucks cuz
then we have like that I don't want to
ruin the radiator and it does start
rusting in some of the steel parts yeah
my girl salt kills stuff when I'm out of
my boat all the time in the Gulf I have
to basically wash it off and cuz
otherwise salt just deteriorates yeah
it's very destructive it's not worth it
for today yeah I agree
okay so we got the ice in there I'm kind
of on a clock for this so that's uh
what's next run it on well we need some
Ellen home to you so we haven't oh yeah
we haven't even that now you got a poor
of Angela the containers to build a
transfer yeah I'll give the plastic one
so you don't hurt yourself okay this is
gonna be funny to watch I've gotten
better at it
actually yeah he's got a way better
headquartered the first time he did it I
think we did but I don't think it made
it into the video I get it pass that up
did you cut that Angie you did write the
first one you might have to do a
highlight so this this what doesn't have
a name I was just a cap with foam in it
and it's a foam cat and it's a
ridiculously expensive I think these
ones were going
like 150 or something like that I was
like for a piece of foam and plastic 450
bucks also this is the official way to
do it you put it on an office chair with
wheels that can't lock well it's easier
to basically try to impor it from a
higher point yeah try to do it from a
lower point and then I've been moving it
back as I tip it because otherwise it'll
fall off the chair yeah we don't want to
waste that one too like that yeah I
think is that we're all around aren't
you it might be that in the air on the
truck on the way over here yeah I think
that's pretty much where whoo yeah
that's where boys there you go give it
up yeah
loser Oh put the cap back on so we don't
lose more liquid nitrogen
yeah they kept actually works pretty
good it's actually well worth 250 bucks
to be honest because this little
container on here stops it uh and
filters out so when it really is
pressured oh yeah some other ones that
just have this and it actually goes
through it and if you're filling these
all the time I can stop my worth the
money because yeah so just so everyone
knows that this tank over here this is
this was always my question when we went
to events I'd always ask what does it
cost and this tank was like greased 350
360 something like that for that for
them let's deliver definitely delivered
yeah yeah
I know it depends on who you go through
air gas tends to be a more of the
pain-in-the-rear you know there do the
others I like I had I have one in my
garage sitting right now I paid about
$200 that's pretty good yeah and I don't
have to go through all their
stipulations all right you just put it
in my garage and with them they won't
deliver to residential yeah so this if
it arrived properly fall I guess would
have lasted us the whole weekend so you
get like two days out of it roughly at
least for the pace we were going so yeah
300 something the tank isn't ours that's
I think there's a deposit on it and then
yeah I think a rattle yeah yeah so if
you ever want to get into it try to stay
away from air gas so if there's another
company you want to try that and then
maybe go to air guys if you have to
right so they're just easy for us so
that's Phil do you want me to fill
another one yeah might as well all right
go through pretty quick and then uh what
are we gonna start with you can start
getting the pot cold yeah so what I'll
do is I'll wait
well I guess I can start off right now
it's kind of fun to watch you bored
thanks cuz I'm at least you're trying to
learn from me right yeah
learn not how to do it so much well I
like watching her JB just kidding
so just so everyone knows in terms of
and this was my biggest question so I
when I started doing this I was a little
scared of you know how much is it gonna
hurt when I missed and it really doesn't
hurt that much like I said if I'm
touching a metal part of the handle and
I got Allen to on it that kind of burned
a little but it goes away like you said
at the beginning of the stream you just
don't want it to so great yeah you'll
see it like so usually when I'm fetching
in like maybe like when I did the
Vantage world record last year you'll
get burns and stuff just from pouring so
quickly so like that's he's doing it
pretty slow but he's still learning yeah
but uh
oh you'll end up getting like slight
burn but there's nothing anything that's
gonna really mess you up
also try not to I try not to lose a
bunch of it to the carpet right now yeah
especially when we were low on Allen's
yes yeah we have about 30 liters I think
to work with yeah so 30 liters is gonna
go pretty quick so we're gonna try to
pace it out a little bit yeah
well what I'm gonna do is bring the
temperature down your own minus 50 we're
at 20-something right now about 20 what
I'm gonna do is just break your start
bringing it down don't worry al I'll
turn the AC on that'll help a lot you
know bringing it down two degrees
compared to compared to that minus one
day yeah
alright so we're gonna kick off the
cards we have two power supplies right
now actually this woman and the pump
should be going as well yeah it is like
in here so water clean pump just kept
kicked up that's the that's an e K dual
DD see they've got a reservoir and then
the two cards for the loop
yeah we're gonna boot up so I'm just
booting up default we don't need to do
something to off and then what I'll do
brow -50 I'll do all my own two voltages
that way we have some cold if you go to
too much voltage too quick when the
temperature is not cold you can kill
your chip which is a $2,000 chip you
don't really want it yes so that one is
mine that I yours I know even better
I love think your baby doing into
Windows is that what you want right now
yeah it's like okay so let me get some
super chats while you're starting that
off we have I got on the MIDI paris
scarlet tagged $4.99 thermal pad testing
still ago like I said waiting on some
icx 20 series cards I think we just got
lucky Barker two dollars thank you lucky
bazinga axe $5 which dual system case
second ITX would you recommend course
1000 table yet what's that 20 now I was
just looking at Tim we're at 20 yeah cuz
I'm showing so that camera can see it
but no yeah yeah yeah there's a
thermocouple reader over there I haven't
tested a lot of them and threw a lead I
can't count the Hana I don't know of
course are 1000 D is huge I don't know
the only one I've used is the evolve X
and we thought it was fine it's a bit I
think over expensive but it's fine
quality it's just it's just way too
expensive but the the Evolve x was
pretty good though Jade on Terra 100 I'm
not sure what currency that is thank you
Tullius at chat all dural of she
represent I'm so sorry for how I said
the name of that place but thank you for
the contribution you butchered Marwan
rhymer $5 greetings from Germany I'm
enjoying your videos feel and doc Johnny
nimble $10 Canadian world's best day
attacking show huh kind of is a cooking
show I guess yeah for real ha we should
have there some ice cream in there you
know yeah we were talking about that one
the
L&amp;amp;T guy showed up and he said well he
said two things to me one was what are
you doing with this and you had a better
response than I did yours yours was drag
racing computers yeah it's pretty much
the typical question like what are you
doing
yeah there's mention when they say it's
not a welding shop yeah well the next
question is like how do you do you guys
ride the computer around that's the best
I think it's quite hilarious actually
then I have to go into the point where
you know it's like it right it's not
right literally yeah cuz I can oh they
look at me and they're like how's your
big ass fit on a computer are the are
they both artsy excitons yes yeah yeah
$5,000 worth him
yes were years worth of reasons to be
careful yes the other thing the guy said
to me was he saw the lights in the
cavity so this looks like a porn studio
oh man and I said well we we film videos
for YouTube and I guess it's like
computer porn for nerds and I said wait
seriously no it's a hardware board you
think you two would learn I should have
changed the channel to that yeah yeah
hardware porn
I think you would kill your search
ranking the best sadly yeah they
probably would not like that haha guy
farts $20 thank you don't cut your hair
is what makes James Nexus wow thanks by
the way what's your preferred they're
all passed for generic air or water use
I use crown off but is there something
you prefer instead fine that's good I
mean for a lot of air it doesn't matter
all that much it's more about the curing
time and cryo doesn't really cure so I
like it the long-term use they have been
a sponsor of us so I'll mention some
others as well I mean kpx is really only
something you want to use for like for
this kind of stuff it's fine but you
know it's not like the mainstream pastes
you could use Arctic is fine but
ultimately they're not too many
differences when you're under
err because you're talking a couple
digit you know single digit degrees max
this however there's a difference on
what pace you use right because it'll
it'll crack I guess yeah well it would
for the temperature there's temperature
range you're at you want to more of like
a silicon-based right so like liquid
metal as day learned you don't use with
liquid nitrogen or I think even dice to
be it's kind of an inverse the colder
liquid metal gets the less effective it
is and once you start going sub-zero it
just doesn't really work anymore
yeah if you want to kill stuff that's
what you do mmm alright so now we're at
minus 50 I just enabled the heater just
plugging in the PCIe it's pretty easy
how expensive is on to you that 180
liter tank we have was for me a little
over three hundred Joe has paid in the
200s for his yeah it all depends on your
local distributor right so if you ever
want to get it you go to a welding
supply place just try to stay away from
where go move the wire in front of the
time sensor they're saying I think
that's just in the college I did only in
the way of the readout yeah I would do
this not too important though these
problems are kind of a pain so I use a
thermal pad instead of thrown paste I
would not recommend it but isn't roaming
coming out with anyone yeah but that's
not even yeah you know he was like this
is not for performance it's for
endurance which is pretty cool that is
he's so straight about it like I mean a
lot of the manufacturers just won't tell
you that yeah that's a good part right
my little bit colder going 4700 on the
stream right now only it's pretty damn
good yeah it's actually really good
hello Jay kicks our ass with viewers on
stage he's like twelve thousand oh we
need to make a bigger yeah - sixteen
getting there
actually when two little ones these are
a lot easier to pour Emma we do we have
to pace ourselves a bit here so we don't
have too much on - you know see trying
to be as efficient as possible
Chris serger $5.00 yes very efficient
someone asked me if you could just
submerge the rig and Alan - since
there's no air to condense water on it
would it just get too cold the function
the problem is is it's not like it's the
other components not just the chip that
could have a problem so usually we want
to try to keep everything else on the
board like memory for instance you don't
want it to have have a too cold about
the Samsung memory just the most of them
don't like cold you have to keep them at
positive temps so you kind of have to
isolate the different components right
actually overclock it would be nice if
we could just do that but unfortunately
it's not that easy now let's see
ice-cream man I need my eyes jack wow
that is a 4k screen yeah
what are you looking for Ilia you eat so
elite as a software utility we're using
for the EVGA x2 90 night dark which is
the platform the motherboard we're using
and unfortunately eleaf is does not
really scale that much with this screen
so yeah so you're not really gonna be
able to see it on camera but yeah it's a
little tough or if you're Joey you're
not gonna be able to see it either
hey I'm bud I'm old my bifocals
not really but seven on I can help with
this all right so what we're gonna do
we'll go right to about 5'4 does this
help
now it's actually universe oh do is we
just do a quick 5 4 what do you want -
what do you want - bitch uh let's start
with geek bat just because it's easier
yeah cuz times it's not that pretty
though like you can only see so much
yeah well let's let's start it just to
see if it works
there you go I got to do some super
chance to let me do this one first
Geoffrey Faris $99.99 thank you very
much we greatly appreciate it that will
help pay for after YouTube's cut like
the fourth of the lm-2 tanks haha much
appreciated
see that quinn star beat 5 Live's any
updates on the viewer sent CPU is also
any preference between a map gas and
butane well you take the map gas goes a
higher temperature so to come you want
to use a map guys basically okay and
will I think it burns higher so it
basically you want to do map PES it did
well when you want to heat up you'll see
in a little bit when I go actually it's
probably around that time OOP breaking
shit already
whoops now I'll show you in a little bit
yeah you definitely want to go map guys
okay I did you teen doesn't burn as high
so are as hot update some viewers some
CPS we've had a video films for like a
month and a half of it we're just kind
of waiting for a lull in the content so
we do have an update and Patrick
recently sort of a rain though the he's
sorted through the ones we can use for
testing they're actually gonna use a lot
of your CPUs from viewers for a retro
testing which will be really fun and
then the rest that were damaged he
pulled aside to make like an art piece
out of like some old sepia originally
pixel art you know I have a ton of dead
hardware from oh I was actually you
should make your own that's what I was
thinking about doing I literally have
boxes of like graphic cards yeah need to
be put to rest well I mean like they're
Bauer said in the comments at the last
video rip their Bower more like rip CPU
and Joey
if your innate if you're an extremely
overclock you've killed stuff haven't
you haven't pushed hard enough plain and
simple so what are we doing right now
I'm waiting for the pot to empty
let's have - like 65 that want to heat
it up and torch it I figured it's like
the leading proof effect so if you torch
it up and it gives like a glaze so that
way you can manage the puppet
alright now it's the more I pour it's
not going as cold so really reacting
this really is a cooking show the
viewers right you know just need to like
glaze on the lm-2 pot we show you feel
like Martha Stewart yet - the jail I was
thinking though what the one lady like
the most famous cooking burger person
can't remember her name
maybe I don't know like a little bit old
that's maybe what it is that makes you
check your phone see one of our mods
there Barrow is watching and is in chat
if you didn't see my girl you know who
Quakerism yeah jay says check your phone
he tweeted it
oh okay I don't see any text from Jay
and I will say I will say where's Jays
message Oh Facebook
he says watch latest video a couple
things one Winston do any CPU overclock
enough me I don't think we oh yeah I
mean when Vince visited I guess right
Wow somehow came up with a score that
was a top of my house honey whatever it
was just whatever you said was a joke
anyway yeah I was just kidding we didn't
even push the 79 80 is that four point
five that was over a year ago so forgot
most of the instruction I don't take
offence though if a random knew that L&amp;amp;T
like me can get OC folks talking then
I'm doing my job
yeah it's actually a good thing yeah I
mean we my guys I like to just bust
we weren't positioning this as like a
rip J you know it's just like hey let's
I didn't like the chat let's do a
cooking show and ah yeah cookie : oh hey
so very good to see when Jake comes up
with next because he hadn't decent CPU
it's pretty impressive
Jason yeah it was actually quite
impressed this Aiden leaves what Jen and
I were talking to like when we started
yeah this has been really educational
for both of us for Jay and I because
it's forced us to be competitive to
learn right we're like more about what
we're doing well as you guys learned to
everybody else gets to learn yeah you
guys get to provide different and just
show up mostly threads why I was they
doing erener yeah well that's a thing to
be honest II you learn from Erica yeah
right that's the whole point so you fail
you pick up go again yeah yeah and it's
a little easier for Jay and I to learn
from error because we most of our stuff
is sponsored so now versus I haven't did
our casting I was X's were not spotted
five thousand reasons I do not the
domani to miss as your Alan to poor all
right let's see if Steve doesn't say
she's done ski Joe once during the
livestream I'll be very very sad she's
done ski that is a quote from kingpin
himself at the the G skill you were
there next to him yes was right thing
and I was doing a video with with KP on
his robe Locker and
like eight hours of starting collect
water and he was having a lot of
difficulty with blue screens it's just
we had that yesterday oh yes
starts acting funny after a while maybe
we had some memory issues yesterday yeah
and another concern is you can get water
in the socket stuff like that oh yeah so
yes yes kingpin said she's dumb skis to
you that's just and that would come back
I got her back Steve she's back that's
great you should copy that and yeah just
use it you have like a button so every
day live streams sound more ski I think
the record I would say oh yeah I'm sure
you do it bitch is a fun guy making all
deserts with Alan to is actually thin
yes yes we were talking on how that
would be an easier answer to what do you
do with this when they arrive with it
yeah if you don't want to talk to him
and you what kind of just want to get
away yeah just make ice cream
all right I must think rather like ice
cream on you so we just rebooted
yesterday
gonna hire recent what was our current
setting it's just a week five four three
seven so five for our encore
37 my man mesh I'm gonna try lower mesh
voltage it seems like meshes giving us a
little bit of a problem actually all
right so here's our settings we haven't
shown these yet 101 be CLK 2.2 CPU then
1.54 vcore
I think people are gonna see 2.2 on VIN
and go isn't that high
well we're cold and we're really cold
and I be honest I might actually jump
that up again right so yes these
settings are not advisable for ya you
don't want to do this when it's I mean
you'll build up so much heat cause
problems
don't do it especially on a $2,000 CPU
yes unless you get them a bunch of free
we got one for free and and I will not
get one for free
ha ha ha hey mate I can give this one no
I killed it
that's not what I mean ha ha ha Thomas
Anderson $20 Steve I had to give up my
hair for a job please don't do the same
hi oh my gosh I I run this job so we're
good yeah that sucks though Frank our
$5.00 should I keep using my deal it's
every ID oh no it's go all the way
should I keep using my deal in at 79 ad
XE or get a 99 a div for Oh seen so my
stance on this in our review was there's
really not that huge of a difference
between the two I once soldered one
isn't and if you're not doing
lnto our recommendation was the 79 ad XE
as kind of a normal overclock or an
enthusiast was easier to work with
because you can deal with it it's pretty
safe to do it there is risk but and then
he do liquid metal and get better
results thermally but I think Joey you
like the 99 8 exe because it's soldered
for Allan - yeah it's much better as far
as uh dealing with liquid nitrogen so
you have to delete this evan he's done
980 and basically you can you have to
worry about paste underneath the IHS and
you have to worry about paste over the
IHS with a sergeant 1 you only have to
worry about on top of that HS so it
makes it a lot easier right because
there's a asking it can be quite
difficult when you're running liquid
nitrogen and paste goes and you don't
know which one it is and then you gotta
clean off the paste underneath and they
do it and rebuild
it's kind of a bamboo but what are our
settings right now I just lowered the
the mesh voltage so what I'm gonna do is
and right minus 84 on the
thermocouple that thermocouple is
between the bottom of the pot in the CPU
I guess right yeah it's like the
standard mount on lower the room
temperature please Jared yeah
follow me let me drop it one more degree
you think that'll help the oh not really
what do you mean Alan to is only net
minus 196 I think the the extra one
degree Fahrenheit Wow it takes forever
to still go nice
although the GPU loop isn't really doing
anything I feel like I'm all the way
over hey Steve you aren't doing any OSI
Joe is doing all the work
yes we can we can trade I can do some
GPU stuff on time aspire or something
yeah why don't you maybe dial the uh
yeah you like it
I did five for about thirty six so okay
she's a little bit lower I think meshes
looks giving us a little bit of the pain
so yeah five four three six right now
okay you want to pause it there and do
try GPU or yeah sure after you my friend
man do you want to so we've got chat on
the right so I read all the super chats
if you want to hit like a couple of them
shorter I have not read this guy's yet
yeah okay so start out wishbone if you
want all right so where we got it we got
wishbone congratulations you have all
the requirements to be able to run n64
beetle Adventure Racing in 4k wow I love
this see the test results oh wow any way
possible
what is beetle Adventure is some meme I
don't I haven't figured it out I haven't
looked they say it every stream though
I'm very curious I don't know if by all
the requirements they mean like this
wait this is this is what you need to
run it oh and make sure you go and let
CPU them -66 right now where they want
it just took - 80 - 80 gamers next -
okay so next one Aaron louder can you
make an in-depth video on overclocking
CPU and RAM I asked cuz every video only
says set X and P program and only
touches on voltage for CPU and nothing
for RAM that's a good question is this
for everyday use so ok
you probably see that my channel
to be honest yes that's kind of what I'm
gonna be going for Pierre did hardware
if you wanna check him out that's right
so I don't know you want to do some what
are some basics what are you for this
guy's question what was this more
interested if ur intime een I'll do a
lot of overclocking but for daily I just
kind of for daily I just do
I wouldn't finish yeah you got to be
very careful though because you don't
want to start causing memory issues
right so you want to really test it
thoroughly okay because otherwise you
can with the memory issues you can
corrupt the bios writer upped the osu my
we did that yesterday yeah we definitely
did that yes yeah so uh my just that the
best thing is just go lightly on it and
test it out and maybe image your OS just
in case in case and you can use a Cronus
or something for that too
yeah I actually am a big fan of Acronis
a lot of guys use toast
Acronis yeah it works very well and a
lot of the problems I had with ghost is
I'd lose images all the time so yeah
they're honest I pretty much every image
I've ever done I have so it's good stuff
so this I just did I'm running this
windowed it's just times my not extreme
right now and I just today what I do 160
for the core 930 offset for the memory
on both cards and then max the power
which is only one 14% of Titans but
they're a bit more powerful than the
2080 I I'm just running a windowed so we
can get an idea what temperature's the
loop at and hopefully it's under 15
degrees it looks pretty good so far yeah
what is it right now it's 7 degrees for
the idol it's not bad that's porcelain
feel real good and where did you who's
question did you last you got the the
next one and so the next one is the best
channel one you need to have a 32 bit
pro $1.99 thank you there is excess you
guys have the best yet on you
- well I appreciate that that is a whole
lot of pressure but thank you participle
$10 okay okay
$2,000 but I'm not cutting my hair on
screen for $2,000 and you're like 200
though yeah you got to pump with a lot
more than that I mean you're talking
years of work this isn't easy all right
twelve degrees for the GPUs right now
which is really not bad considering what
we're on we're at 12 and 13 core o'clock
so we're at about 21 30 megahertz which
is also not bad we can push that a bit I
think memory where it's stable I'm not
seeing on the artifact at 9:30 offset so
we can go up on that oh I need to uh you
want this at minus 80 you said yeah it's
probably gonna take a little bit what
are you at -48 yeah you need two one go
colder easy on the cold though yeah
that's empty yeah I got these two it's
gonna I don't let you do that one right
now I'm scared of that one you can be
the auntie monkey today for a little bit
that's it that's it his new title
actually my LinkedIn profile yeah I want
to monkey 48 hours of experience very
skilled now seeking opportunities when
you come to Computex I'll put you to
work
know for sure I'm down for that yeah
that Steve's hair versus nerds Nuggets
game Ian Steve's hair versus Joe's beard
and a fight to the death who wins beard
wins yes we got the name for one of our
counters tech Odin and tech Jesus that's
right yeah so we're still stable for
just normal times by this is doing
completely fine no issues at all 21 30
megahertz for the GPUs looking good
pretty hot though 14 degrees Celsius on
the GPS what's our seats EP temperatures
here - it's gonna be bugged out though
right yeah it's not worth it
so CPU it thinks it's it's negative five
but in reality it's not it doesn't read
below that no so so we got motorsports
$5 thank you motorsport I get tanks for
80 bucks but I pick up down that's a we
have a which tanks like usually if I
bring my 30 liters and they fill it's
about 60 to 70
oh and so sounds better that's only 30
liters yeah so that's 180 liters right
well supposed to be some diversity yeah
and it was a hundred eighty when I left
the store and honestly it really depends
on your store like a lot of the times
okay we're good yes is progressing to
the next bench yeah a lot of the times
it depends on whatever your local store
is and it's really different by region I
know air guys has set up in different
regions that's why we even when we were
getting it was like I don't know if you
have to do your writing or yeah yeah I
know what I was thinking maybe they knew
there was me and they basically wanted
to give you a hard time they just me
they just have a black flag on here yeah
that's right that's probably why sucks
yeah make it hard for him to buy from us
we don't want his money that's funny
we got a couple store orders so actually
well good amount of store I'll do my
best year to read it out a few out you
said from Dubai that's pretty cool
alright goodbye we got a signed poster
we're sending to do actually to going to
this person in Dubai thank you for
picking that up and one of the mod mats
much appreciate as always on the Mod
mats those will be here in a couple days
I'll be shipping out soon Jason in Texas
the president do autograph on those we
do we have we have an option on the mod
mats okay but it's a huge pain to do and
I have to drive an hour total to do it
so we up charge it yes yes I'm spending
a lot of time doing it alright so we
passed by the way nice so there's just
normal times by I don't even know what
the score is kind of art for that yeah
it's a little bit different just to keep
the screen shot so we can see what you
did
you wanna overview some normal times by
I don't really is but a two-car normal
times by its just for perspective on
this one I'm gonna keep you you want to
all you already push the GPUs a bit just
a bit they can go more once you do mem
on the GPU we can do that that probably
be really good action yeah I can do that
here okay with us did you see what the
score was
I shaved it okay it's alright I didn't
save it Boop oh I ran a custom so with
you I calculated yeah it's not gonna do
an actual say we want to do memory a bit
more and let's let's just do like 10 40
offs and that should probably be stable
so 10 40 offset memory there's something
memory kingpin was teaching me about
Delta clocks and memory straps and so
what I learned from kingpin I don't know
the best way to overclock the memory on
this he's certainly about a million
times better but what I learned from
them is that just getting the highest
offset isn't necessarily the best even
if it's stable yeah it runs no it's true
you might get a lower score it might be
better to step down a bit and that's
because of I guess there's like certain
points for the memory just performs
better yeah it's an amount of clocks you
use so like so if you go up it I think
it's maybe there 25 or 50 you have to
play around so like if you do like say
plus 700 right and that's the max it
will go if you actually go down maybe
plus 695 you might actually get a better
score it's like it can we call it a
delta clock right so and I just always
play around yeah pretty much not on
we've seen this too and I reviews where
overclocked in the memory like on our
2016 Lee I could get it to run at like
plus 900 song that has a lower score but
well not only yeah I was lowering up yes
in games yeah it happens 5% yeah so I
had to drop it down well what the well
people most people do wrong is they
actually go by clocks it's all about
really efficiency and score so you paid
her into score not clocks yeah you could
have one card that does a specific clock
and then another card that does way
better clocks but they had the score
sucks yeah so it's more about efficiency
than going by certain megahertz
right oh thanks someone's reminding us
Alan to lid it doesn't matter too much
but we are really low on it thank you
chat why you need to overclock that much
what's the utility for your desk talking
out of this Joe everything looking at it
everything you do is pointless pretty
dependent I like to slack basically I
mean it's fine right it's it's no
different than any other thing you do
for fun well it's kind of even like drag
racing so why do you have to go from so
fast from here to there it's kind of
pointless right no cuz it's fun that's
the whole point if you're not if you're
not having fun doing this then you
probably shouldn't be doing it no
because it's it's really frustrating it
oh you know if you let it get to you
yeah yeah you gotta have fun while
you're doing it that's the whole point
right
was the Swire they say an F the stream
fall or something stream looks like it's
kid I think was f you know why are they
saying F there's a hey as a stream still
going guys
oh I think this may be because x times y
is loading well they can't see it so is
there ventilation in that whatever when
pressing f what died ventilation in that
room I don't know they're saying why all
the s I haven't seen I'm not me if the
stream still up though but I think it is
whatever is there ventilation in that
room basically you're gonna die from
nitrogen so we were talking about this
thank you stream is fine thank you Sam
great to see you I appreciate it like
regulars like you so I can rely on you
to not give me a BS answer now
everybody's doing it yeah of course cuz
they know that I'm like come on alright
um fuck where's I fuckin so are we gonna
die from from nitrogen from the gas well
here's the question is what I said
before right yeah
he's threatening to kill me ya know so
since that's able to light that means
there's enough oxygen so right and this
torch can apply you know there's no
oxygen in the air right and that's
actually for more experience than
anything if you benching
like smaller rooms there's a good chance
that you can lose oxygen so you need to
make sure there's air but since we're
using torches old
it makes it I don't know it's a good
measure of what to do and you kind of
figure out the kind of if you need to we
have room yeah yeah this is a very large
space yeah there's a good enough amount
of room here I mean we only have one
tank and it's pretty much empty so it's
not even that bad
I remember again at the gigabyte OC that
we had like eight tanks mm probably in
this area yeah Jane just messaged me
again Jay I already read your message a
message me on via text and I said well I
percent honest no one helped me get to
that five nine we learned through trial
and error also learned that past minus
1/10 we get cold bug yeah that's a chimp
dependent usually array he does have a
good question for you
ask him what he's learned regarding cold
boot and how to overcome it
that's a great question from the
homeless dogs and if you don't know J of
course go to jail youtube.com slash jst
sounds friend of a friend of the channel
so what is what's your advice about cold
boot yeah not that money there's not
many options you can do it otherwise use
that heat the pot up yeah you got to
heat the pot up the trick is to really
when your veteran is not hit any cold
bug right good though you're gonna get
better clocks and and better scores when
you don't reboot I know I saw this on
his stream there's a couple times when
he had some issues where it would just
reboot like we did before
yeah we had that causes paste issues so
next time you go you're probably not
gonna be able to have a good clock and
you got a breakdown and we replaced
right we're we running times by extreme
I think I just switched it now okay do
you want time aspiring stream do times
by because I think I don't know this is
a new version of 3dmark it seems like
it's a little buggy
I swear at ten I just increased the
memory offset a bit 1080 megahertz
I'm good times but yes just times by ugh
all right
just letting J know that I read his
message yes so J is two cents of course
check him out if you haven't he got to
Ellen's he before us and had some good
videos on it John Peterson two dollars
shout out from colorado you inspired me
to overclock that is awesome to hear you
should subscribe to this guy link in the
description bearded hardware to get some
more OC stuff brian police and of course
others in chat there Bowers out there
builds oi damn cop all those guys check
them all out
Brian Gleason $5 the temp probe wire is
directing the middle of your display for
the cameras view I think we fix that
already yeah it's old Andy yes you'll
learn quickly that I fall behind on
these and yishun $20 my my sir thank you
Andy Gabriel semen $5 by PC Jesus hair
and steps of beard powers combined we
create captain overclock hashtag group J
that replaced using where this is an RF
j thing it's a this is just just a
cooking show right captain overclock
Jeffery Farias that we got yours but
I'll read it again 9999 thank you very
much poster like that yeah we need
someone to do like some kind of
superhero drawing exactly combined hey
man if someone wants to do the drawing
well like with my beard your hair member
yeah you have one arm let's super ripped
and the other one that can't pick up a
30 liter tank oh man what are they funny
what big arm what's wrong it's just for
the doer I swear just for the only
reason Matt photo car $5 keep up the
good work do you guys offer office tours
unfortunately we do not but I don't know
we're like a video in your channel or
something you want yeah we're gonna have
a video on my channel about doing a
little office tour yeah we'll walk
around it'll be on his challenge to
check it out I scrolled up Xavier was
the last one
Xavier Flores thank you 50 bucks in
your currency I don't know the symbol
Thank You Xavier hi I love your videos I
have it not perfect English but I can
understand almost everything watching
you from Mexico keep up the great job I
love you well thank you your English is
perfectly fine we much appreciate you
watching and greetings that's who it was
Italy a child it's like we're here
reporter come on there you know I
believe that's from her her L&amp;amp;T is
special yeah well yeah I love that one
my voice isn't too bad either yes I
probably from previous years of inhaling
helium herself that could be it yeah
that's another thing - have you ever
done liquid helium to be honest no
because it's it you can't do it all by
yourself
it's crazy at least your wall it's it's
stupid exposed you think that was bad
times that by 10 yeah and that's for the
same amount all right and not only that
you need at least three people and you
need also the proper bend hardware and
they'll also do it for pace or CPU like
you couldn't like doing liquid helium on
this one would be completely used right
because you can only go minus 110 so but
I'm this smaller chip like the
mainstream chips like see three ninety
or ninety nine hundred K it's actually
pretty beneficial right as you can go
prep at that gap of minus 196 I'll
refill you here - what are we at for
settings right now where do you have it
I had to reboot something happen with uh
wasn't my GPU overclocked or was it seek
you know there's someone 3d mark okay so
they're now at 3d mark the system info
just seems to not run I wonder if we
should revert to it but on an older
version uh if you're this is a newer
version I'm gonna have to test it out
Sisson folks you got it yes these are
all no
let's say alright so at five four again
what you do or not
I had a 169 110/80 offset memory 160 on
the core core can go up higher do you
like 180 on it right because I think we
did
I think 190 with gestures 190 was kind
of stable yesterday on the test alright
and do that on that both of them just in
case
yeah I'm testing them both you need help
look at you're having trouble with
precision there I can't see that's the
problem so what were you on the memory
again try 1080 kind of questionable on
that just type 1080 Zoe oh that was
maybe are you doing much easier
I can't barely see that was the plan now
to hinder you yeah let's do 180 on the
GP core Lee is the placebo voltage
slider does a little bit but not much
I'm 180 on the core just make sure the
same and then 1080 offset memory I think
there was just a crash that we don't
know if that was from the GP or like
3dmark bugging out or what or seemed
like a 3d mark because we couldn't even
kick off through your mic let's run just
time spot and see if that works because
I know it's even like J row man and all
them are using an older version this is
the newest version sometimes they
introduce bugs so that's what developers
do yeah I'll meet ago you know that okay
a Scott Scott Khloe would you stop
spilling my onto on the floor we need
that I barely listen how much is on this
floor from you yesterday I heard that
you need certain temperatures for
different voltages and frequencies why
can't you have a super cold low
frequency overclock well again it
depends on chip which chip you're using
so it's a lot of the things with so for
instance this one the 18 chord has a
thing called was it Fabra I forget the
fiber five higher yeah fully integrated
regulator Bela whatever it is yeah but
then that actually causes cold issues on
this trip so no matter what you can do
there's nothing you can do that will
the time spies running make it go good
yeah there's something with time Stratus
tell us why you can see it it doesn't
want us to beat anybody
yeah I'm Titus by extreme pepper times
pi is a different story but no but I'm
the colder one ah you can go pretty much
totally completely cold which is nice
but you have to have certain voltages to
do it you have to really tweak certain
voltages of the chip to allow it to get
colder to be able to have the cold scale
so I don't know if I've had a question
but Peter rusts ER just I think DKK is a
Danish kroner maybe $20 thank you you
two would make a beautiful baby with
your hairs I'm not sure how I feel about
that moving on I've done like signing
posters today I'm in when her mom mats
expected putting in an order today Joe
stop crushing shit stuff that's
counterproductive what did they crush
the ladies I don't know I'm not sure hey
so mod Matz they are on the way to us
and then they'll we go into you so I
think we're probably receiving them this
week I paid all the customs and
everything so they should be in I think
end of this week probably for sure and
that means they'll be going out by the
weekend most likely so if you do want a
mod Master we're not gamers I just done
that we have one on the table and we've
got a we've got those coming in shortly
signing posters today yes Joe and I will
be signing posters if you buy one during
the stream and that'll be the the only
window cuz it's got to go back to
Florida Taiwan basically a MIDI holder
Taiwan we're only 32 percent here which
is great for essentially a lot better
minds usually like a 70 ever yeah and
this isn't just like BS small talk
yeah actually does matter for what we're
doing for the longest time when I was
actually when I first started I would
kill a lot of stuff and I'm like why do
i why can I only bench for 20 minutes
and these guys are been cheating for two
hours right and I started studying
humidity and I learned that where I was
from had one of the highest average
humidities in all of the United States
so that that's pretty much how were you
know that if like Romans watching though
he's gonna be posting about how I was
just he's making an excuse oh yeah
is that Roman never kills anything for
example the 99 80 XE that he deleted
that definitely still works yeah sure
did you see that video no I didn't know
he deleted a 99 8 exe and the results
were not good
hey any killer oh yeah no cuz I ended up
doing a ninety nine hundred K Idol it it
and it sure enough didn't work either
I just popped the top and darkness ours
was okay but I wear that Sofia solder
ripped off you could see like man if
that were a little bit stronger would
have pulled part of the tie off or
something yeah Wow let's see he's got a
picture I'm gonna have to check that out
of his yeah yeah I wanted to see what
the die looks like it probably just
looks like 79 80 because it's not very
different he so I think some of the
small caps and SM DS came off or
something why you should not deal with
your I 999 80 X 8
there you go so it's just missing a
bunch of the SM DS yeah but it looks the
same as the night and I had her K I'm
killed it alright so here's another
score so we're at 19 581 for x by yes
not bad for just kind of hacking around
while yeah yes and so our GPU we're at
180 offset core both I mean they run in
anything so and then uh 1080 offset for
the memory we can push that a bit too
you want to do CP and our GPU so let's
just do the GPU stuff okay so let me
just I kind of keep your settings so
really if you look at the scores for
like even the RIP j and the rift of our
times my extreme is really kind of one
of those things where you need to really
go more on the GPUs than yeah definitely
this that's what you need to be learning
to be able to Vijay GPU I need to learn
like how to get better silicon for my
videos what that didn't push memory a
little bit larger yeah for sure for sure
memory series to see what the memory
will do us so that we might crash on
this I'm doing 190 core and 1124 the
memory 90 worked pretty well actually
okay well I'm a trained pushing harder
so we'll see ya you want me just shy
just run time spy again just Rho times
pi it seems like there's something wrong
with this version cuz every time we run
type I scream he's just making excuse
making excuses slacking we call them he
isn't he's leaving times by extreme for
me to do on my own that's right you're
not gonna win this bath I mean we don't
I don't want to post a score that was
like Joe did it
yeah that's supposed to buy cameras
that's it yeah who wants to do so well
I'll do that I'll get somewhere Ellen to
and try that I did order all the stuff
so now I can be a poser I'll just put it
in the set I'm not gonna use it right
just like look I'm an extreme
overclocking now that'd be kind of funny
and then people watch and do you like
wait that stuff hasn't moved in a year
hello right the same you move it it has
like a big dust around no guys I swear I
use this all the time
it's pretty funny okay so we got some
cons that's running Jason Kristoff
through $9.99 a plan to test the new
fractal mesh fi case keep up the great
work and Jo should check his sub count
why is it being now what you start out
today 300 something yeah I haven't
really been pushing it I get more
Facebook because that anything check it
out let's go check fractal mesh fi case
I am aware of it and a lot of you have
requested so what are you keeping this
out right now negative 85 or something
yeah minus 85 is fine did you tease it's
kind of slow going in between right so
yeah master pricing no current plans
were aware of it once we get through
some of our existing testing
requirements oh do I start working on
that well we went past a thousand work
when was that 1500 oh nice thanks guys
if it crashes it's my fault
well it's always your fault aren't you
learning it well yeah I'm learning
something alright that was a dick is
what I thought that was nice
Reggie oreganata $5 canadian just want
to help with cost balancing well thank
you very much as a super chance for the
stream will be going towards a more L&amp;amp;T
purchases because I I will need to
budget for getting the tank 1/3 empty
have arrived
ridiculous I think you know what I think
happened is KP sent my note and he was
like hey sabotage to my biggest fan yes
I think you said make sure they don't
get all that on til they buy yeah for
real
max Samsa and $5 more money to help both
Allen to you for the next stream thank
you very much of course the super child
a store best way to help more monopoly
money for snowflake so well so cordoned
off this money for simply ultimately she
is a CEO so stuff like dictates my pay
actually I know that I didn't know that
and she's actually she has a scheme
where she buys cat treats and then we
just get whatever's left everything yeah
it's not great big gets paid in cat
trees yeah thank you max Hansen though
you're our captain planets 150 MT that
is that a different empty and TD is the
only NT I now by bad well then I don't
know have a post them no I don't know
yeah wherever Norwegian Norwegian I
don't think it's not region kronor cuz
I'd be at least somebody else knows it
anyway how do you travel 150 or
something I can tell from your your
voice really Julie I think you have to
do it again what that Julia now rapport
the fog it's pretty good
that it's pretty good a bunch of work
did took that to now is Julia Child is
the cooking woman that's right hey
that's a title to have I guess as a Docs
$4.99 which ROG r-tx 20 ATT I would you
grab matrix Poseidon hybrid or Cod for
strict special edition and put in a
custom loop hello the streamers always
well the matrix I wouldn't put in a
custom loop because the whole point of
it is that it's like the gimmick of
having the radiator in have you seen
that card you know it's got the radiator
in the shroud so like I mean it's not
it's not really that effective I don't
think as a cooler but it's kind of cool
as a gimmick yeah it's definitely cool
to see right yeah I would not recommend
that for open-loop beside in hybrid I
haven't looked at Cod for strict special
edition it's just a Strix I think so the
Strix is fine get a blog port you're
good to go
it's got good hardware the cooler needed
work but if you're doing a nope
then you're in good shape already
Patrick when you get a chance can you
add and a PCIe cable to the big system
that we can't talk about yeah the one we
can't talk about you know that plug it
into the 1080i I put in there it's run
tests on that later okay if you need a
cable there's an EVGA power supply box
on the floor right there next one
John ksss $10 I love what you guys are
doing helping with the Allen to you
thank you out here I was getting 60
liters for 35 bucks in California yeah
it depends on where you are and it also
depends on the manufacturer I bet you
that was not air gas if it is where we
need to go to your I guess we're gonna
get us see some the sister Mary gas I
have real riot Johnson five ties didn't
know you were the guest Joe get them
clocks the harbor bot team is watching
in the house I grip the world awesome
very tight ribbon yeah tango to Box
Islands you standard cooling for PCs in
Arizona sorry they hear that scarlet AK
$4.99 Steve give Joe the magnifying
glass that you just really can have the
piece of nails or set the zoom window to
200% we can do that you would've jumped
easy again yes jump up there in the
clocks yeah yeah if you look down there
there's actually a screenshot that I
took that I don't know what the score
was compared to the other one where'd
you put the screenshot okay it's on the
desktop the problem is that that's how
are ya
was it personalized or display settings
these days if you take a screenshot with
that he's gonna ruin the screenshot I
was just your dad like that
yeah alright so let's do it was wasn't
running it was pretty stable right it
passed yeah I passed with flying colors
so let's do 11 6 the offset we're still
at 190 offset on the core and I'm let's
do 1160 on the memory I would like to do
some of my
my trick I learned from builds right
that is very cold and there's some hot
keys but I don't know if we will see if
we even have the LM t left word well
let's Fighting Cocks first before you
men through this yeah it's definitely
gotta find where it crashes yeah we're
still good on ice you're gonna do a
little bit more memory I did yes I
bumped us to eleven sixty so let's let
that run and then we'll jump it maybe
the twelve forty after that twelve forty
I found is normally pretty stable on the
twenty eighty s sounds like playing let
me read some normal chat stuff for a bit
how is it how's it going normal chat
how's it going the the non-super chat
normal chat I see a lot I'm I suggest
removes by our mods I'm not sure what
they were but stratified thank you for
helping out of course Ryan's in there as
well help get Joe's channel to 2k our
mods have picked up at all wheat so yes
Joe's got a channel he's starting out
Joe you're gonna have to do some work I
know now I get it I can't select any
without now you know I am the king of
slack yeah so thank you of course
trousers by always created what's normal
chat saying you need a different monitor
for license yeah we need a few things
for questions yeah pearl shift windows
key s screenshot is nice yeah and we
didn't have to save well actually what
CPU is it it's a ninety nine eight exe
you're doing good guys me and M me AG
started the overclocking war between
Steve Jay Paul Roman and Kyle if you're
a number we made the challenge on stream
I honestly don't think I saw that I
think it was just it was before the
twenty eighty TI's launched I think oh
it was maybe it was I don't know maybe
it was you if you mean on our stream
because I'm this is back to reality
saying this because when I was streaming
and someone posted like hey Paul is
posting scores that are beating yours
right now know that I was like you know
what Paul this is war I think we should
get more Wars going on their YouTube
because to be honest has been
entertaining right now the war is
YouTube versus the Creator so yeah or
yeah that is true thanks YouTube sorry I
don't don't uh don't erase the super
chat rev-share
okay speaking huh
Ian watch eh $5 thank you
the two by Vega 64 heat exchanger 2 by V
62 X B 64 heat exchanger owner says
hello out of a second
16 gigabytes 32 hundred megahertz kit
starting to get in the average hello to
bearded hardware a new sub here no I do
stop from eeeh gonna see it how about
the C again
yeah Michael Scott five bucks Ellen - is
cool and all but let me get some beard
growing tips what are your tips beard
growing tip don't shave it
yeah don't shave when you wanna shave
don't shave what about a picket of shave
don't shave okay so but but what if I
want to shave though don't chafe
okay yeah that in conditioner
conditioners like your best friend like
for your hair yeah I actually for a long
time I use my girls uh conditioner how
much how much do you use / - I use more
on this than I use that I kept there
like a quarter of a bottle oh yeah
it's like very similar yeah I'll
actually have some beard products too
and I've been working on a are you
serious yeah I've been trying to let's
get a skin marketing yeah I've been
trying to do I have liked new shirts
yeah yeah like I got a I'm gonna do
beard products and then just a bunch of
stuff it's just kind of fun I've always
wanted to do it so I love this shirt got
a bomb from the expert right the expert
beard growing that's right alright ii
heard five dollars i finally changed my
name from nasa with the knife so you
don't have to read it anymore
I probably butchered it one last time
for you also I just stopped here patreon
loving the content of the ways well
thank you an asshole with a knife I'd
like to remember arctic nerd so that I
can then remember an asshole with a
knife because that is definitely not how
you say it but I like saying that oh my
gosh we're stable here so we're in the
CPU test now which probably talked about
overclocking a little bit as it is no
see stream yes so what are we running
that for the pot temperature just about
minus eighty right now the real goal
right now is just get the cards going
alright cards make a difference oh
actually we need Ellen to to you only to
poor oh yes I got this course well we
can shut oh you want me fill this up I
just want to see what to score that was
a much better sport
we were at 19,000 before yeah we're at
2390 yeah that's a big jump from the
memory Oh see yeah like yeah that was
kind of one of your things that you
could have yes I expanded on that
probably took on Roman a lot a lot more
so yes and we're saving that for anyone
watching we're saving times by extreme
for when I have to do this on my own
Jose can I actually just be standing
behind the camera in the alley man yeah
it's done ste ste it's done she's done G
all right so for people who are joining
in dropping out whatever you haven't
seen this yet this doer 30 liters later
do it I gotta fill out this is like a
$150 plug funny cuz the tank itself is
probably like 3 to 4 12 News died think
I got that one third for 300 knew they
were probably well about 400 I just
spent like 600 on one yeah it was a nice
new one though right and do you want to
explain the what the doer is what it
does again for people who are just
joined well it's like a Yeti kept it so
insulated racing like a bigger version
of a Yeti comb so it's a sealed metal
container that doesn't condensate and
you need it to store it or to get liquid
nice so if you want to get liquid
nitrogen and start playing around you
need one of these first and where did
you get yours on
yeah eBay seems to be the best place to
buy them the ones on Amazon were little
too expensive and that's of and not oh
yeah what's the point yeah I agree we
should I explain a couple the other
basics I like to go through stuff a few
time sure people join in so let me uh
I'll point to some stuff when you want
to kick off a run first or yeah let's do
that for sure
alright so I'm gonna let you memory up
on it yeah why don't you uh want you
welcome through like what the Ellen
teapot setup is for people who missed it
earlier okay so obviously we only have
one Ellen to pot here we didn't have
enough liquid nitrogen to be able to put
the two cards and it's not necessarily
really worth to put these cards on
liquid nitrogen because they'd have to
be modded that's why you see a lot of
guys that like in the ln2 world through
either bench in the galaxy off of 20
atti or the kingpin you're right or when
it comes out when it comes out yeah but
uh with the titan next
best to pretty much keep it on cold with
when it's not modded and you can
actually gain a lot of clocks from that
just the way how would you PU boost
through going on works so one of the pot
I'm using right now is the kingpin t-rex
it's a fairly large pot I don't know if
you can get any view you want to take a
look at it or not it's cool but uh if
you if you want a slack it's cool I
guess yeah you did
Andrew slacking over there so we gotta
try to get him laid it seems like he's a
little quiet and not doing too much
you're just gonna get dad I know right
doesn't work much more technical
difficulties
no and you I don't know if anybody knows
but Andrews that guy behind the camera
is yes seems pretty much a star over
here so the precision did not like when
I changed the number and click the ply
so radically crashed
that's precision for ya which one was it
just remember you can't cut that if I
was just memory card so let's try that
again
just gonna relaunch it without rebooting
or anything
what's our CPU running right now you
just said some if you said I can crashed
oh you want to restart and it's probably
no I'm not gonna make too much of a
difference let's see if it goes so would
you say jump CPU now oh no what is your
CPU I think my four and then three six
right so this is acting kind of it's
actually near it's more five five than
anything okay cuz at the 101 B clock
right so this is acting a bit slow right
now I think which may be restarted no
it's it was a precision was not happy
with being used that's the biggest
problem with softer right you're really
not supposed to do anything with it
what's the point right how's he gonna be
the king of slack yeah I'll take a job
where you can just say yeah I updated it
it's done go away something familiar if
there's bugs can't reproduce can't
duplicate I don't know what you're
talking about
technically not a bug it's it we have
these things well it's a feature exactly
yeah testing for a while yeah all the
time
oh let's file a six-page bug report and
they're like working as designed these
are features
features it's about we the developers
always sort of wad whereas those
features that don't work Craig from
Kansas picked up one of our tear down
crystals thank you and also a video card
components poster which will be signed
from Joe and I during the stream today
if you buy one during the stream pick up
one of our video card posters like on
the wall we will be signing them after
the stream that way Joe doesn't get any
sleep before he has to go back because I
think we have to sign a lot of them
daddy but you will be able to
commemorate Joe's launch of his channel
and an appearing here teaching us how to
do some Alan to OSC should i over
talking to the GP is well actually you
know fit the cpu first yeah you can do
it worries you were Cindy I just go
overclocking tab every clock in and then
five five yeah I did a bottom on bottom
not the bottom on the second for the
market an yeah yeah I just put it for a
five five so I see it you're booting out
45s right mm 36 for the mesh yeah 35 to
36 times 37 seems to give us a bunch of
issues so what is your order let's
explain for the audience why do you boot
at a at like 45 instead of just 5 5 well
I like to boost lower because you never
know when you're gonna lose paste so a
lot of times when you hear the term
paste cracks I know what what that
really is is the paste freezing and
there's no contact between the pot and
the CPU right so I like to run it a
little bit slower so that way if it does
happen and I need to reboot it was lower
right it doesn't kill the chip that
makes a lot of sense down so other guys
will argue that some like to do it a
little bit hotter you can do it maybe 5
gig it helps with the bonding of the
pace yeah
really depends on the setup work I've
learned that there's like a lot of
voodoo magic and overclocking - oh
that's right should I quit this
application should I quit Ely for the
right I quit did you apply it yes it is
it Wyatt
sometimes it takes a little bit to apply
no quit precision otherwise Joe will
yell at me it's true make me cry again
when you keep those utilities open they
tend to affect your scores so well it
depends if you're using
the hotkeys and stuff right a lot of the
times it can't affect your score for
sure yeah cuz if you're not doing
hotkeys there's no reason all right kick
it up so what was it what do we want to
go over again I just true walking
through the stuff well I mean we went
through some of it so I mean we have a
this is the onto beast bought from their
Bower will use this at some point we're
using ten pins today yeah and that's
just the one Joe brought this is the one
I have from Roman so Roman thank you for
watching everyone should go buy one I'm
sure it's in your price range it's cost
about a computer if you want to but I
mean there's good reason it's like Libya
it's quite beautiful its yeah you almost
don't want it that's it I just want to
drink out of it you know it's that's put
some whiskey in there just be like just
sip it yeah I'll do that in the stream
Roman send me a pot and then I'll do
that okay but and then it's it's
extremely dense so I mean you can't
really tell by Kara but like it's good
good like five sometimes beautiful
insides pretty cool so it's all I don't
know that's like mushy it's kind of like
an art to be honest if he almost did you
see that great to touch it it's pretty
very pretty
yeah so that's we think I guess
basically is just increase the surface
area what the haunt is contact yeah you
basically you increase the surface area
by Perot we provide more surface areas
yeah I guess the theory is that you can
soak easier hmm and then the here's a
que peak pot steel barely uses the
technology very years and you were
saying that so this is all scarred on
here yeah and obviously doesn't come
like but that's from your torch no what
happens is so these these are very uses
they've broken a lots and lots of
records so what happens is when you
torching up so at the end of this I'll
torch it up to a positive temps and what
it happens is the insulation that I have
just kind of I would use a that arm of
like stuff around it and I build my own
like little insulated container but what
that does and it kind of melts on there
and gets stuck so someone in chat says
stratify please don't promote other
channels first warning Don wells Donna's
not a moderator specify it is so the
channel that's being promoted as Jose
and you should subscribe to issues
I'll enjoy watching I didn't know I had
like relinquished my responsibilities
don't know what other channels let's
just not talk about anything
yeah we're just air it that's was that
good they're gonna think you're frozen
everyone's gonna type half and then I'm
gonna say what understand the F comment
it's cuz in cod there was like a scene
where and cod there was a scene where it
said a press f to pay respects to like
some dead end piece to hear something
and so when I were I did homie yeah so
whenever something bad happens or one
type of that which is actually great
because in the chat log after the stream
you see like you it's great because when
I was trying to find b-roll wants from
the stream that was like three hours
long I looked at the chat log and I
could find whatever it crashed like a
hundred messages in a bunch of f yeah
maybe we should put that on the poster
yeah yeah let's see I got energy it's in
five dollars epic hair epic beard I
found the other half of my CPU shall I
send it there half of mice hey how do
you lose the first part yeah
plus stupidly hogs money well thank you
for the donation if you send it I'd be
curious what you mean by the other half
maybe maybe only something like the lid
or the bottom or something for Andre
Olsen Norwegian krone at 200 thank you
very much please hide the facial hair my
pants are getting tight
move on that's a little awkward my
finger bazinga axe yeah you get used to
it two dollars which cpu did you say it
was how I got that one that was his
first they say it again
it scrolled up so I lost it oh you just
donate a few times thank you here it is
this is one I read I think a tax $2 hair
or beard ever caught in a pan comes
close yesterday you were like no I
everytime I go a fan you'll see me I'll
go like this because I just do not want
to do it
no so technically I've never had that
issue yet
actually it's a funny story I almost
burnt my beard I mean I was putting off
a board with our goodness
CRC yeah well never spray anything with
near a candle with this name I needed up
with my both my hands on a fire for
hours oh yeah basically basically I was
pulling my you know mythology
mythological mythological but I
basically had two hands up fire it I
actually lit the beard on fire
yeah so that that passed we were stable
at 12:20 yeah but it looks look at the
score was lower but what was it CPU or
was a GPU the issue I would do a let's
say a reruns I'm well CPU can definitely
improve Pat check oh uh hey we gotta get
you GPUs going first cuz that's what you
needed
yeah extreme let's try 1260 offset we
might be able to push the core a bit
more and see if it just crashes cuz uh
that's been pretty stable so I did 1260
offset now ready for me to run this go
ahead I'm gonna jump up CPU clocks
probably next ok so this runs
successfully build you hired GPU call
sir CPU parsable $5 can you make a wig
out of it and wear it again
wear it again hello did you have a wig
no are you talking about a beard wig I
have no idea I'm gonna sell beard wigs
do the other thing come on I mean I'm so
pissed that I did not give him a beard
way if I have one too and I forgot it
was a package that's dead dude usually a
g.skill when we go in to copy - yeah I
usually have all sorts of toys oh yeah
had a beard we exist when I had my
mustache I'll trade you a shameless
promotion one of our copper mill knives
I already got one taken away I will send
you indefinitely so we we have a photo
of this on our Twitter that was pretty
fun so we pour it onto into the ice
bucket for the GP is really I don't want
to go get another bag guys
yeah report Allen's human which refroze
the water and horribly inefficient
but it looked cool though and then we
put the cup on top of the frozen you
know the ice and then filled it with
Ellen - yeah so there's a photo you can
buy these on stored I carry snacks has
done that if you want to support the
stream your partners check Twitter yeah
you'll probably see a bunch of the
photos on there yeah that's cool it
looks really cool especially was even
looking on the top end of it I don't
know if there was like pictures like
shimmer yeah looked awesome was that
whoa I don't want to waste on you on it
right now just a tiny bit okay sure tiny
bit let's get the camera in closer first
now when we run out it actually looked
pretty cool because we ended up getting
some of them now it's my fault time spot
is a stable though so our GP is looking
good if it crashes it'll crash so just
somehow do something below so some some
education for x by gt2 is very memory
intensive yep and if it crashes at this
point it's because I because the new
memory clock we could do hotkeys to
lower it a bit but that'll chill our
eyes a little bit although like I said
inefficient but you can see there's all
he'll a lot more ice now a second ago
yes this there you go there's a big big
block of it right there they're so happy
to have stabbed it out done it didn't
happen
I was really low I want to Paul the
bearded one five dollars I once shaved
my beard for charity it was like if I
want to quit I raised but never again
I'd rather donate my CS for real it's
kind of weird you ever see like those
channels like where the the guy shaves
but he has like a daughter that's maybe
like two years old and then all of a
sudden they like look at him they're
like definitely afraid like who the hell
is funny my kids I did that one time
so like one of the things too about a
beard just just never cut it because
then you don't mess it up so one time I
need up messing it up and I had to shave
it all off and my daughters are go daddy
don't ever do that again
don't ever do
get it come on really so now I've got
VOAD to never shave again what's what's
chat saying did I act in 33 1933 sons mm
awesome thanks guys appreciate it that
means I can't slack too much anymore
it's damn right I gotta be doing it
stuff left around that's all right
that's a plane anyway so we do a bunch
of live streams to a lot of onto on that
floor yeah I know from you yesterday
all right so chat what's going on chat
we got to wait on a slight delay I have
to pay respects to Joe's beard
previously I guess yeah I just do Ephram
yeah let's see that would be awesome
so what is uh what Steve do you sell GM
branded razors no it doesn't look like
now is that's the half now see we need
to come up with a poster don't get a
haircut and don't shave yeah like I get
it all right your support went down
again I can't get so there's a chat
normal just normal chat question can't
get 30 200 Hertz rated Patriot memory
dual rank to run out speed on my
homicide expert 74 any suggestions well
um a first 70 means right in yes I'm a
tribe well loosen the tie it may be
manual so even a BIOS update make sure
you have BIOS yeah that's cause a lot of
the times with the rise in setups is a
bigger right there is a big improvement
yeah there's a huge improvement so if
you're really good if you've never
updated the BIOS number one rule number
one yes yeah so you're lower so I think
the we might be Delta clocks issue or
something I yeah well you're up a little
bit maybe push it down a tiny bit and
then rerun and see let's go back down to
twelve twenty then because that was I
think a higher score yeah maybe we'll
jump up a hundred megahertz on the GPU
because the CPU seemed to be wrong
yeah and we can push more out tour as
well ready to run you want to increase
CPU open up elite and then just uh just
give it one more CPU core and I'm sorry
for the screen guys it's that 4k so it's
hard to see but I've got the GPM Joe's
kind of mind controlling CPU here I've
been from jelly
you've got gb we just set the 1220
offset cores at 190 what has been stable
1220 it went to 1260 to drop a bit so it
might be a Delta clocks issue and then
you said you want to increase the CPU
what how did you want to go 100 so we're
gonna increase core 256 matches at 36
that okay yeah I just keep it for now
okay so apply ya would technically it's
a little bit higher because we're at 101
D clock so yeah you're actually probably
what she's had 56 yeah if it so you're
probably like 50 650 yeah right go a
little bit colder about minus 90 what's
the max OC we've been able to get with
the 96 RK we got hours - I remember like
5.2 or something they condemned ago but
I think we just kind of stopped there
because there's just a review so let's
see this is Betsy the promo code for
today's live stream and that is amazing
tip craft in 98 $5 hey we met at sea
yeah it's 2019 on the msi booth thanks
for making the whole trip even better
you were super cool and person not sure
which one of us should talk about but I
think we both thank you so yes probably
you I don't think I was that at my side
because I didn't go there yeah well I
had a lot of laptops and Dragons house
they do yeah I heard yeah I know I was
trying to get a dragon and Java story
you wanna have like seven I'll take one
they gave us so many and then I I felt I
didn't want to throw you I'm so bad like
their whole luggage was a bunch of
creepy direct it kind of would be weird
yeah they're cool actually they were
pretty cool - Emma sighs credit doesn't
lie you've had like the big monster he
does I think he said he spent like a
thousand dollars to ship it are you
jealous
like if you had that whole thing it
would take up so much room but it would
be a cool entertaining that's bigger
than the Ellen to container yeah alright
so we're gonna pour out of the Dewar
into the flask it's getting kinda low
we're getting very low I'm gonna have to
start doing some suicide runs
what suicide runs are basically just
pushing the higher clock and you're
hoping that it runs and just again
people just joining in
you might seem you got some of us on my
hands it's it's really not that painful
it's like a sting for a second and like
Joe said you don't want it to soak so
like if you're wearing socks to get on
your socks that would do even shirts and
stuff like jeans not so bad but like if
you have anything that's like a kind so
even your shirt you don't want to get it
all over the shirt I mean you can get it
off your shirt but like anything that's
tight formed if you wear like tight
pants be careful this I think we've got
about one more of those pores in that
yeah so time aspires running I wish we
have an ear
we still have a good amount then oh no
decent enough it is 100 megahertz higher
than previous week and see if there's
anything left in that tank but I think
it's empty no the other ones definitely
empty it was basically but no nothing
Dylan Bundy $10 what programs do you
like to use the test everyday OC
stability for CPUs RAM and GPS I like to
use 3d mark for like a real world gaming
test because the stability in gaming
won't be the same as in prime95 or fir
mark prime95 26.6 is good for non AVX
stability test in twenty nine point
something for a VX testing you got a
reboot maybe you know is that just from
a power well I think it might be decent
okay so we're gonna do is jump up beats
in you want to explain what that is for
everyone oh well that Barbara basically
it's the input voltage driver I'm there
yeah fibre so on going into the CPU
there's one big voltage that goes in and
then there's a voltage regulator inside
that manages all the other so bolta jiz
so if your input voltage is too low it
basically trips almost like an OTP
someone says this one says 2k achieved
for your channel so we'd thanks guys see
someone else says better to do Allen to
naked I'm not sure anything you want to
see this website yeah and then someone
else says
let's see how much is that tank a
volunteer well that was about 300
something back so I am going to Joey now
you say it's empty but I'm gonna go
ahead and try and say go for it will
drops on it there might be so maybe the
magic hair will help I don't think it's
that powerful I'll give you some beard
look I would turn the chair so you can
see it yeah
there you go remember hold on to it
before you go there's are things like a
snake it could would be an head so
there's a transfer hose a little bit to
me you hear that whine
might be a little bit weather usually
that one told me then you're done ski
nothing's coming out of there I don't
think you're done ski helicopter here
yeah you hear that y-yeah yeah done skis
I'm gonna have to start using that old
time though it does come out like a
liquid right I mean like it's so that
gasps is that gasps just from yeah it's
just guessed it inside the Taino get it
figure it's uh there's no pressure loss
because it's probably just building so
the guys just a sand yeah but you always
hear that little wine good like how to
hit your ears there right yeah right
okay we're starting to run it out and do
here yeah so we'll go through we'll talk
settings at the end to yeah what I did
is that bum be said was that a the input
voltage it was basically at 2-2 so we're
gonna jump it up two to three see if
that works
what were you at we're five five four
five six we tried five six yeah it was
five six
so five five was running it's just five
six one and 36 on mash I think yeah so
there's obviously some type of input
voltage issue and like I said throwing
watching if you buy a poster during the
stream while both will sign it
to commemorate Joe launching relaunching
this channel and me trying to do some
Allen see what we're talking I didn't
take your club yeah I'll set the clocks
Matthias from Switzerland picked up a
whole bunch of stuff from the store
Thank You Matthias some shirts decals
poster material and we got Matthew from
Virginia picked up a shirt as well let
me get my clocks I'm glad if you go to
the fourth tab I think you can do some
super chats fourth tab super chance all
right where'd you leave up it uh Dylan
Bundy you know we got the atom is
haven't done Adam okay Adam is done ski
the promo code for today's live stream
or Ellen to monkey I think is a great
idea I think when we got Vince on here
Adam just amazing yeah I don't want to
steal his thunder
I do want to get Vince on he's he's a
funny guy
he's good at this I think doing it
probably I'm only time we're gonna get
him as a feeling tight type a yeah
probably should do it with the five
stream there so what is it getting Glenn
house eighty one under or hash tag are
tewara
some money towards some PI P seven deci
one case review oh I'm familiar with
that case no current plans to review it
although we will thank you for the pie
money for sure
when there's this pie money we speedo
it's mine don't worry about it this you
don't share the pie huh no my feelings
are hurt well this is this is America
okay so it's what's mine is mine what's
yours is mine
yes fine alright so the Irish giant
that's a hot canary you got there I have
no idea but thank you for the two
dollars two dollars my two dollars all
right so we got what five Creator
whatever yes quicker tech good luck guys
hope you get some strong scores what
does Joe think of HW bop Rev eight
enjoying more subs counting also by the
way what superhuman 80 X 99 80 XE r m8 I
don't know I wasn't too crazy about it
especially it was so buggy and I think
it's getting better also have to start
subbing more over there you might have a
lot of subs the finest ad here yeah just
keep it - a right but yeah so I hope
there's a rib 9 basically the summit of
all right so uh Inderjeet Singh Joe I've
used Oh - meters that'd be bat certain
Oh two levels for going and fuel things
would find them beneficial or would I
find them beneficial yeah anything the
actual actually like save yourself is
actually probably a good thing yes you
should probably actually have one in
here we can do that yeah I'm you another
time we'll have like a bunch of tanks
and just go through some Ln two masses
next time we should definitely have like
two tanks yeah I think two things cuz we
can make this me to make one tank out of
that right yeah
Yeah right yeah I think that's a great
idea
okay so bazinga underscore X period
hardware subs almost doubled earnest to
more than that it's actually Depp more
than that I think it was that like 350
or something like yeah it's probably a
2k I really appreciate it guys I'm
remembering a bunching full content new
content thanks to Steve oh yeah
absolutely me on here I really agree we
might do a video together too while he's
here so that'll be on on bearded
automated hardware
yeah so then we got Ryan s oh so that
was 20 whatever seconds SEK or actually
no sorry that was no cheers from Sweden
so Tobias wing which is sec 20 whatever
20 seconds Swedish kronor I guess I
don't know Ryan s donating towards
changing to a 1080p monitor top that's
the probably the best five bucks you'll
ever get yeah I could that see that
thing for anything sorry
quitting bail five dollars I feel like
this is more of a riff der Bauer well it
will become that once I know what the
hell I'm doing yeah and then there Barry
can leverage his multiple years of
experience and the army of chips to beat
me and his German performance
engineering excuse me it's perfect in
German engineering at whatever TM TM and
I'm actually curious to see what Jay
comes up with no one's talking about Jay
I'm kind of excited to see what he does
with that CPU he fits good and James got
my he's gotten pretty good at well we
got CBO now he's gonna get the GPU
saying right once he gets that I think
it might actually be a good he's gonna
pass my score for sure my current score
oh yeah I mean since what to fails
lately and then so probably the next one
yeah but third time's a charm right and
you do have to fail quite a bit to get
anywhere with this stuff so yeah that's
true you to be honest what you guys see
usually from overclocking like if you
see a post or anything like that like
someone with a score there's four
everyone post there's probably like 50
fails that go into that one big post it
really depends on your hardware
yesterday it was like 12 hours of this
yeah like playing around trying to
figure out little nuances yeah
bugging so right now we just passed gt2
which is memory intensive on the GPU GPS
right off set of 12 20 and CPUs at 56
I thought 101 BC was a tube 70 negative
4 minus 70 well just throw it a little
it's probably gonna pull a little bit
okay you know it is probably your gt2 if
it the scores lower is probably
definitely a memory that's empty
you wanna OH switch I highlighted Witter
the fail I don't know if we switched to
slow maybe oh I made it through okay no
it's actually good score the scores
going off for sure don't know like five
or six hundred points let's see oh we
got this one I think ondrea's can't use
a candle to check for oxygen yeah we
were using the torture yeah
the best way to do it if that torch
doesn't light we know there's no oxygen
so we're good and this is a big space
don't worry about us my quarry schroeder
$5 1/2 sec just a cooking show with
Julia Child's and Captain overture five
silver stains one died no Isis thank you
Scott Washington $2 scaling please I
guess in the monitor also what CP is
this 99 80 X 80 and I'm gonna try and
get I don't even from the EP guys one of
the capture cards they use our character
cards don't survive the reboots I don't
know I'm gonna tell touchdown tastic let
me know if you find one that works what
my I don't know if it's my specific
version of the elgato 4k works we can
you like we can try that because I tried
that one that one who actually worked
great just for interfacing and debugging
and showing stuff on life right and then
like my razor the razor I actually used
for just going to my camera to be able
to show right like way basically what
we're doing here caption is it cold in
the room or a lukewarm cool
I don't know I'm here so it's cool yeah
it's like 68 or something fan night yeah
Simon to Britt $5 fun watching you
splash and leave the lid off dangerous
chemicals its I know that every long I
mean the they're only recent leaving it
off with sock is losing out
yeah that's basically I like fall office
ventilation going we're fine
all right I put the could change the
clocks on the cards I just pump the CPU
I'm pretty happy we can go higher let's
try a CPU for try so you point that at a
time yeah yeah I'm just going cuz we're
running on yes that's why I'm trying to
get through a bunch of super chats I
know like you bad Matt McGregor $5
you're not fooling anyone I know you're
Steve from hard when boxed with hair
return to 11 I mean he also must be able
to duplicate himself and teleport I
guess
Phillipa Ram is $3 how much does the mod
mat repel Alan to you it well if we had
extra we'd show you but pretty tan while
J did it actually I think in history
what about Matt yeah it just bounces off
yeah it's not gonna really cuz it
doesn't really soak it's just evaporates
instantly yeah it's kind of like the
carpet very well though see a little G
6,000 $5 what's the biggest worry you
deal it a nice 70 some-odd okay there
isn't much of one if you use a bad tool
or you do it improperly and killed I
yeah they're thin yeah
just don't use too much pressure I mean
right just be careful
use common sense is basically the you
know what I was told was on the screwed
monkey tight not gorilla tight like
don't torque the hell out of it right
here yeah cuz then you can you can cause
damage Center negative 999 this is just
playing good fun well I am glad to hear
that we're having fun as well please
keep this time slot in mind for future
streams we can totally do that I heard
that a lot cuz I used to like to do like
more later yeah me too and one seems to
be pretty well what we hit we hit like
you're up the still awake in awesome
yeah that's the usually the killer right
there everybody usually gets well I want
or we watch your stream or whatever
right Quinton battle $5 can you please
turn on scale and I will do it next time
sorry motorsports to 20 liters dealt
with air gas a lot if you think excess
he uses a lot of n2 older lithium
detectors in TEM needed to be kept under
Ellen to 10k plus if you let them heat
up Oh kept cool for years that's crazy
that's a cool little fun fact yeah I
what I find on the streams is you kind
of find like who actually uses LM too
well alright and it's quite impressive
what they use for it yeah like some of
the things that you just don't think
about I'm kind of thirsty so I'm just
gonna dude just gonna get some ice water
you want me no good you want to actually
use it for overclocking yeah something's
supposed to be furro see here we'll just
put a little bit in there okay taught me
off I want to wait a little bit to drink
that that's aggression so would actually
work as a Ellen teapot for a low TV you
have to do that you can pick these up by
the way store that gamers accessed on
that not afraid to shamelessly plug that
this is getting there definitely bearded
approved to I have to have one of those
also they conduct because it's actually
a copper it's also not stainless steel
so that handle which is brass connected
to copper pretty damn cold right now
with that
yeah stored out gamers ex has done that
if you wanna helps happen in this
chain-link garage next 1i
it's a Russian name I'm sorry 200
Russian rubles I guess Steve what are
your thoughts about cheap Chinese x99
motherboard and used 2011 Zeon's for the
price it looks pretty decent we we've
been working on that but I've 79 and
we're having a lot of problems so yeah
thanks 79 I expect Mary yeah so I would
say just do some research on what CPUs
are compatible because we're having
we're having issues yeah that also be
careful to on some of the chips where
you're getting them from so you never
know on eBay like who's actually pretty
thanks yeah that's that's the big thing
that I'd worry about is more than I
think cuz I've heard a lot of people
I've had people ask me to look like
violin
kind of crazy
I think the lioness got like a fake 56
core or something like that we we have a
little bit more in here than I thought
so should I spill it all on the floor
right now that uh uh we're done what a
crap donkey yeah CPUs the test yeah CP
test what settings now actually so it
looks like that uh the beefs in work the
input voltage okay so actually let me
just do this real quick so reboot was it
called out yeah so we went to two three
I'm probably gonna bump that it's a
clock watchdog timeout which is usually
CPU voltage okay we're at one five so
I'm gonna jump it up to maybe about 1 5
2 okay gotcha yeah yeah it looks like
the input voltage is gonna be our main
problem throughout because the more
voltage you put the more current it goes
through so the more you gotta do to be
some decent is not a setting that's on
the main stream platforms either know
what all right
is it yeah it's basically input voltage
line nothing on which board I have a
torch looks like it so let's explain why
you're doing this we haven't done this
yet so right now it's at minus 85 and
it's not booting properly so usually
it's like some type of CBB so what we
have to do is we got to heat it up until
it is able to come back so torch it up a
couple of super chats - you killed our
$30.00 is there worth getting
360 XP red yeah I was gonna try to find
it
just remember to unmute it after him for
a 2700 X CPU only Lou I mean it's it's
worth it a night it'll work really well
it's you don't need it but it's it for
sure will work well it's just you don't
you could go with a with a cheaper one
if you wanted Jamie shot five dollars
message five dollars thank you very much
Jaden lamb ten dollars hide you can you
hear me now
hi Gianna have you looked at the ek
Phoenix radiator core modules yes I have
one in my office building radiator with
pump built-in would something like that
be good to create a makeshift AO for a
twenty eighty with one of UK's water box
it would absolutely work I did the same
thing it is not a pretty loop but it's
very easy and functional to setup so
andrew cruise to dodge canadian what the
what percent does your score improve on
ellentube versus ice bucket a
significantly a big big improvement got
all your memory channels yeah I chose
one Ernie was beeping a bit yeah yeah oh
that was actually a one five four so
we're gonna go up to about 1 5 6 ok so
one five six for target vcore two point
three then V mesh here at one point
three and so there the core settings in
here in AVX everything look really low
we are increasing those in the OS
instead for anyone who's like oh yeah
yeah for all the clocks yeah so we're
using elite for that it's an EVGA
utility just do this yeah I see a
wondering why I keep I'm taking this
data is that if I take out the state
it's much easier for me to go to the
BIOS so then I plug it in after and boot
that way I'm not going yeah and if you
miss it a kind of sex with all until I
yeah yeah and it's not good for the last
two especially if you have your memory
I'm scalar so yeah if your memory is
unstable you can corrupt your OS alot
easy yeah then where's the script device
it makes a lot of CLE we did yesterday
yeah we had an issue yesterday where we
corrupted the BIOS and had to reflect
there was a lot of like a lot of drama
moments yesterday if we were filming a
reality show whatever works great yeah
for real
it's on that music soon no Manito
schechter 20 oz regards from Brazil also
building a PC up to 10 years thanks to
you well that is awesome to hear I hope
you have fun doing it
that's great to hear yeah absolutely
yeah lots of great parts out there right
now and Bruno says help me here Radeon
bingo 56 red dragon for three hundred
and forty dollars with a reg reg mod or
drop the CPU cooler and go for a stock
cool air bag at 64 Kenna Vega 64 benefit
me as much as amount of 56 yes they
moderate 56 can outperform at 64 for
sure and you can ma the success before
as well but there's kind of diminishing
returns with with AMD once with GC on
once you get the 64 C use so I would say
56 and spend the the difference on
something else and if you want a mod it
do it or just do a power play tables mod
and you'll be better than a 64 or at
worst equivalent because there's not
much scaling and there's C use it's it's
all in the frequency Jamie Shaw tell us
what lengths you're willing to go to in
order to beat J are they as long as
you're there hair well I am willing to
spend money on more parts and I'm sure
Jay is too and he has more money than me
because I feel has a whole lot more need
to work out that you can get more
specific scrubbers I'm just gonna go
sell this car you sell is just gonna
break in and take it to a track and try
to sell it yeah Harshman Zeta 1337
dollars can the best cameraman and 3d
modeler Andrew behind the camera give us
a close-up of the snowflake plush toy
also what central processing units are
you currently operating I don't think
I've actually heard sir you would have
said the GP box yeah sure
99 ATX II forget on the CPU yeah for not
okay I don't remember what I think for
sure 12 2000 Mazda 5 8 basically okay
five eight now yeah 190 increase I'm
trying to push it up a little bit more
just because we're running out out onto
yeah so I'm doing 190 on the core 12 20
offset on the memory still and we've
been pushing the CPU for a bit and so
we're good to go on the GPU side should
I quit this application elite yeah okay
so with the BC okay we're at least
basically 520 figured hurts right now
for the 90s actually pretty damn good
yeah but I think there's some issue we
got to be honest I think our issues are
with any issue of a type of quite
extreme it has to do with that version I
don't know it seems like it barely runs
like stock so yeah like it's yeah
there's something seems wrong I just
need to be oh I'm gonna check it out
maybe a future wife you have any other
excuses you'd like to file that's the
only good one oh and then it's Steve's
fault okay yes of course
guys I wish we had more yelling - yeah
we're gonna have to do two tanks thanks
thanks two tanks like something yeah I
think that's a defectives and then we'll
order an extra because they'll probably
deliver one empty yeah so we get three
oh good I like that
quinton bowel $20 I keep speaking of
YouTube versus creators go hit that
button on PewDiePie's channel so he got
him to 100 million I gotta really he
told he gave me money to say it I'm
sorry
czaja X 199 review planned of the matrix
20 atti to the launch date I don't know
it yes we will work on it I don't think
it's really particularly good to be
honest it's very interesting and fun but
just like though the way the cooler
works you're always gonna be better with
radiator outside of the card outside the
shroud but it's very compact so that's
it's fun and it should be interesting
again so right now let's talk some
overclock and you're at about five eight
megahertz like 20 megahertz
yeah bout 5/8 there about 37 yeah gigger
about 37 on mesh - 100 on the yeah I'm
trying to keep because we don't know
what the cold bug is on this chip so I
know James should about - 110 yeah we
were having this his past - one actually
reminds me the question he asked before
about visa I'm sure when you change the
input voltage I've seen on a lot of
chips it actually extends to hold lug a
little bit hmm
or in the CVV extends and pushes it
farther
well yeah so instead of say you cold bug
at minus 105 you're cold bug might be
extended to a minus 110
I see so you might be able to push a
little bit more colder they're more cold
right
more colder that don't think it's
probably more coldest is actually the
coldest yeah it's more than the
superlative
thank you for years that's what I teach
you in Viking in school
Vikings English I love it Viking school
well yesterday your your we were talking
about testing mythology yeah mythology
not methodology I love it
so how much we got in here I'm still
pissed that like you know that the show
what's shy allowed to talk about that
you know the Viking show yeah because
I'm pissed I should be on that show yeah
it's not right I heard they're canceled
me or something I need to hire me I'll
go on that show I'm gonna do it for free
but I'll go yeah unused Allen too
actually
that's right try to find a way to
incorporate into the show
he used it to refreeze by from he's
getting better and better at that I'm
quite impressed I didn't see like one
drop I'm trying to save it you're
fucking spilling it all over the floor
quick and dirty I'm making them for
yesterday yeah it's kind of funny if you
saw like what he was doing yesterday as
far as pouring and now it's like a huge
improvement have a couple burns on my
fingers from yesterday oh it gets where
he's not doing a lot morning yeah like
around here I usually have all burns oh
yeah and then all right here cuz it's
kind of like when you're throwing it
around cuz you're doing trying to pour
the liquid nitrogen quick right
especially like going into these things
just to get them set up for the next
bench or you might have GT with two
coming up and you gotta get it go in and
run in in between so it gets all over
pleasure you're working alone yeah
Jadzia hacks five dollars thanks for
getting me back in to Ellen 200c yes
even better nice now we can afford
unlocked chips I'm like 10 years ago
more of its about fine-tuning and
squeeze now the last few hurts please
I think we can both do that he's only
better at it couple store orders so I
like I said I'll try and shot him out if
you buy something from store I can't
recycle stopping that we've got thing
that's still really cold really cool I
like this one that Joe topped off with
Alan to earlier and it passed him nice
and that's at about five point eight
gigahertz CPU nine eight four five three
the CBO score is fifteen thousand to
thirty two twenty six I think right
15022 sepia score I think it's so it's
gonna be on me to improve GPU after here
yeah pretty much what it is like but the
thing is is when you're gonna go back to
extreme mm-hmm that AVX I think is
pushing extreme amount onto the CPU so I
think just up way up in the visa is
gonna are the input voltage will get to
now help you dramatically so a store
order from John in Germany got the mod
Matt thank you very much
and one of them you lugs thank you as
well with the thermal conductivity
copper it not it because it is actual
copper Benjamin from Indiana picks up by
copper Mule blog as well Thank You
Benjamin
and like I said there's a couple poster
orders in here if you order a poster
during the stream Joe and I will sign it
and we'll send it out to you before he
goes back so you will get a
commemorative poster video card tear
down poster with Joe's relaunch
overclocking celebrity signature on it
he's a real he's actually a real
celebrity really I'm like me you're
certified right I'm certified Intel
certified Brad from Wilmington actually
not too far I picked up a copper me a
lot couple copper Mule mugs Thank You
Brad yeah you're not gonna be displeased
with those they're pretty bad they are
probably like them friggin hard to make
though yeah that's because it's a nickel
plated on the inside and copper a lot of
these are like stainless steel and
coated and that's trivial but for
whatever reason it's kind of hard I've
seen a lot of cheap imitations to be
honest like even some like places I go I
remember when I saw you put it out I was
like oh my god I need to have and then
to be honest I didn't know how in depth
you went with it that guy was thinking
I'll even if it's a cheap one
okay it's it's I'm happy to know that it
it's not yes sir from the outside
looking in now having done some products
I fully appreciate how hard it is doing
like Caitlyn must go through hell to get
these I was just gonna say that that's
very similar to like cots in a way
because uh just the coding right trying
to get I know Roman went through a whole
lot of trouble to get his direct I
amounts me because the tolerances are so
small that's why that stuff's expensive
oh yeah the your card tear down poster
Alan from New York Thank You Alan we
will get that sign for you and anyone
else who orders during the stream we'll
do that as well I'll try and shout them
out
last one to read for now Michael from
Arizona a video card turned on coaster
as well thank you Michael
alright so how are we doing on the
overclocks before you get another
hundred megahertz or I think we're at
five fifty eight fifty fifty eight fifty
is pretty damn good
yeah and it's if you want to show it the
screen address actually running right
now we're at 12:20 GPU and um well off
sepra memory and then what a moment's
gonna be is when that CPU tesco yes
you're good this one's still fall by the
way yeah we're good for a little bit as
long as it didn't shut down again
yeah which could be a possibility yeah
am I also what I did previously to avoid
that and I don't know if it was just due
to magic or if it actually worked was I
set hotkeys and I dropped the GPU clocks
like nothing in the CPU test well it
seems to be like our major issue is the
input voltage okay with that reboot and
is definitely in the CPU itself hmm okay
it seemed just to be because I think I'm
at two four or five right today we only
tried up to 2.4 and extreme is actually
way more currently about its iris by
3:00 a.m. and I know we gonna we should
call Paul Vincent get him on the street
and otherwise yeah right so he can shit
talk and say she's on ski she's done ski
see happy mutes $2.99 a team bearded
back says thank you thought something
designed for captain overclocked three
dollars that you six sounds from K 3 K 4
alright well I think you got a combine
the be root hair and then I don't know
what else yeah I guys can figure it out
in Twitter yeah we guys someone's gonna
come up with the Droid if you're an
artist tweeted at us they should win
something for that I get the yeah we go
free
your autographs is like what'd you send
us some shirts or something bearded
hardware sure sure that'd be awesome
tweet at gamers Nexus on that a bearded
HW is that your Twitter handle bearded
HD yeah mirrored hardware yeah we are
buried HW black tiger $10 thermos needs
more Allen to you well we've got one
that's for you or me fill up the second
one
I'm trying for now trying to wait yeah I
dig keep on going through there for now
what I'll let you know crowd is sent SEK
66 66 thank you poke Patrick for me on
that oh scope project he hit at Patrick
someone says semi song says poke Patrick
for the Oh scope project you got it
working right it just you needs a
computer so we did get our old analog
ago scope back there which is on right
now Patrick got it to display the GM
logo now it's pretty damn cool but we
need to just find like a small computer
I guess yeah alright something now put
on I just failed dan it's done ski how
far didn't even get like eight second
seconds yeah it's actually not bad it's
not bad but you're talking about 5850
yeah so it's that's pretty damn good I'm
okay I'm happy with that
well I get my me to basically CP dead
sea people ah so I'm gonna basically go
try not that do you have the torch an
hour now yeah the Coleman and some he's
just doing a sniffs oh no it's headed
toward your back right I'll explain if
you wanna meet your hike to my best my
abilities so you're trying to warm up
the pot or the CPU
give me the CPU know about the CPU the
CPU right now what
Oh actually what happened there it just
period okay yeah settings are still
there I do like that the BIOS though if
anyone has been paying attention it says
291 degrees Celsius that is incorrect I
think that is fair to say yeah the temp
sensor bug it's pretty typical see why
dunk radiator and ice and bucket versus
circulating the ice water and the GPU
loop directly well the end result is
about the same and circulating it we'd
probably be the old right benefit wait
so he's saying directly so if you put
the bow like remove the radiator yeah
yeah I mean you could I bet that'd be an
interesting thing to try right he also
might win it through a nice back in
there real quick while we're doing this
I can do that someone says I lower the
voltage and increase the base clock do
you disagree with that assessment yes
because it's actually voltage we're just
trying to get I want to get close to
five nine what's that
sometimes I understand what they're
saying basically what happens is the
cube well usually how you'd like to do
the opposite go base puck more hmm
and just lowered voltage if we can get
it is respectable and by we I mean me
I'm doing all of this yeah it's all you
I will take credit for the GPUs but we
could do more there for sure but our GPU
clock is much better than the last run I
did before see yes yeah actually a lot
better memories much better cores much
better so we were at a like 21 50
megahertz on the GPU I would like to get
it towards 2200 yeah I think just having
the CPU and not in there too
yeah so the biggest thing we've done
here to benefit the GPU as Joe is saying
is remove the CPU from the loop because
like when it's under load just to give
you something idea CPU is pushing about
a thousand watts or more probably more
than that more than that now pushing a
lot of what why did you yes and the
biggest challenge there is using my ice
to cool two times the power as opposed
to just GPS so I'm gonna try a higher
CPU
go down on my shit tiny bit okay
actually I need you to put in the block
size yeah I was gonna pay attention to
what you're doing
let's expect
- given obviously my bike back on ok
actually I turned it off a second ago
alright I'm gonna go over these which
one here you can do I stop them
okay that is ninety two or five dollars
and yes your mic is on you see mags
o-negs there is that yeah so EVGA so
nags 92 5 whatever the earphone is like
quit or whatever EVGA precision or MSI
Afterburner what's your preference had
why say you're up one if you're British
oh yeah yeah precision air afterburner
what's your preference um either you
already have your I actually to be
honest what I do is that when I'm
testing around with cards and stuff is I
actually you try to use both okay you
never know
we sometimes it's software right
software is buggy for sure so all tests
I'll even test Nvidia inspector with it
- you have elite already said on this
can I run it yeah it's or so you're
pretty much at like 58 60 or something
yeah I just have the jukebox
so GPUs still often 190 core 12 20 hi
Marie Potts really nice during our shoot
- guys this has got something it still
yeah yep getting too much too much
voltage or what no I can't do I'm not
enough voltage I or it might just be
maxbox
Andrews five dollars same question why
not circulate the water directly it's
it's fine as is
we can assure you that
whiskey are you meant to be running SLI
it's a low score yeah we should probably
check that but it wasn't a sigh when we
started unless there was a driver issue
we'll check we'll double-check we're
mostly doing a CPU right now anyway yeah
it's trying to get five nine on it half
dead 77 $5 put a water block on my GPU
does that does the thermal pad thickness
matter I use 1.5 millimeter or thermal
grizzly pads it does each block is
manufactured with slightly different
tolerances they might be built for point
5 or 2.0 you can use the wrong size you
don't want to go like too small because
then there's obviously no contact and if
you go too big then you can get some
kind of flex on the PCB that just makes
me uncomfortable yes it matters is the
answer to your question but not I mean
if you're off a little bit it's okay to
be off high I would just not recommend
it really low my mic is off okay no
thoughts this is what you write not now
Joe I'm just testing some settings just
kind of might just jump up input C
before I do that save this profile
go up to 4
what kind of settings you doing I just
want to put the input voltage a little
bit higher okay try and get stability
yeah I think mesh you might be a little
bit I'm an issue I don't think I'm gonna
go I'll jump it up 2 1 3 2 there you go
just trying to play a little bit we
don't really have much liquid nitrogen
so go through and see what's gonna work
it could also be the pot the pasted in
between yeah a lot of the times after
your benching so long you'll see from J
stream where it just stops working after
a while what that is it's basically the
paste the provide a it's providing a
delta basically so what what you see on
the pot versus what you're getting
underneath on the CPU itself is actually
a different temperature yeah yeah so
what you have to do is either heat it up
or you got a rebound every do every yeah
and so your timing yesterday you don't
want to see like positive temperatures
reading out on the motherboard if your
pot set minus negative 100 or so though
right something that happy not booting
let's see Adams Shuman tada thank you
bearded Hardware 2087 subscribers but
that was 30 minutes ago
nice he's linked in the description
below if you want to check them out Eric
$5 just find out that rain tracing in
battlefield 5 who is working on my 1080i
using this command in the game what's up
it's kind of doing whatever want to eat
corrupted BIOS oh yeah well we do have
another bios switch but none of your
settings around there no it's ok I can
copy wouldn't know let's see if there is
regular seems like it's working out so
the command was post processed out
screen space raytrace enable true
definitely understand we'll look into it
invalidate if you can enable it doesn't
necessarily mean it works but I will
trust that you have you have actually
looked at it to see if it's different
and will over to someone starting out
battlefield 5 Rachel I'm Pascal the
interesting right driver you'd be
specific on what drivers you yeah it's a
command line entry to but uh Johnny
nimble $10 has anyone ever done any
pressure regulated L&amp;amp;T loop with active
pumping I'm sure there reasons not to do
it but I don't know if they are Robo
clock are it's kind of like a closed
loop of volunteer it is exactly that
yeah but it's actually instead of you
press on the button it's doing it for
you
Jolyon Vince maybe it was the year
before the year before that he had a one
where it was actually pretty cool where
you can actually bench so you would
basically hit a button and it would
release liquid nitrogen and go into this
just computation like water yeah I was
at Computex we have a sort of video on
it on our channel search the channel for
Robo clocker it's spelled like it sounds
Vince's kingpin he makes these on
teapots
he works for EVGA is basically the top
overclocker and a lot of the charts
right now yeah and so he built Robo
clock because he is basically trying to
replace himself and he knows that he's
getting old yeah they just are just
having trouble lifting like ellentube
pot now they can so he it's a sad story
he doesn't want to be dealing to monkey
anymore
yeah they are so he was we were joking
with him that he need
change his name to destroy a clock or
stop taking credit for it that is true
really cool though it is a closed loop
and he could actually reclaim Allen zoo
after it burns off it's super cool yeah
it's super efficient so you see how like
we it's just burning off you can
actually capture it in another tank so
you get lasts a lot longer
Andrew joy $2 years ago saw overclocking
liquid helium is that a thing yes Roman
did it a commie tax a couple years ago
he was tiny it's extremely expensive
just like you were telling me oh yeah
like it's like 10 times the cost for the
same so you get that I think it's proud
attendant about $3,000 yeah instead of
$300 so it is a thing but expensive PR
Captain Planet 150 NT new content more
like new slacking they're saying about
your channel new slacking yeah who was
that one who captive win it yes he
really he man he donates a lot to you
huh
just to be able to talk about just talk
shit about yellow it just give me a
stupid name five guys why use the doer
at all why not fill the thermos directly
from the main tank and skip the doer
entire my trainer to do so like I am to
turn that loop on you see you got to
hold the thing hmm
and to do it it's just not really
special I think yeah it gets cold it's
hard to work with it's not it you can do
it there's ways to like loop it around
and go mmm but it's just if you have a
bunch of thermoses and like you go like
this and you can go through that's what
vince actually does like way doesn't
right and even like to way you can do it
but it's just it's just not the
sufficient stopping a turn and turn off
dial yeah it's just it's too much work
and you gotta be careful too like I said
before when you turn that dial if
there's too much pressure in the tank
that thing can flip up and smack you in
the face right I could technically
actually kill you right hey though it's
a lot of pressure
yeah dad rocks 199 can you run a quick
Cinebench score even have Cinebench on
there where you okay well I guess we'll
record it I don't know if it's stable or
not we'll see yeah I don't know at this
point
I'll find out how to do bigger I think
is that like almost 5/8 so okay let me
just get the temps a little bit better
anymore oh you've got a full one right
here yeah I just need to so weird it
took taking a request I guess for
Cinebench might as well it's a good time
to do it yeah towards the end steps
harbour numbers $10 I just purchased to
come from you likes to use as an LMG
popular fun please send me like tweet at
us with an update of what you do with it
cuz I'm really curious you might have to
lap the bottom of it but let me kind of
funny to that it really was
Andrew crews $2 in farming we use Alan
to to freedom input vultures too though
in farming views Alan Tina fries for
years
yeah from Owen suit yes yes I knew that
I'm actually surprised this didn't come
up earlier sooner yeah
so that's when I was looking at doors
and I saw used ones yeah and the extra
accessories like came with and you're
like yeah washed it out yeah some of
this stuff the doors are used for is a
little yeah Steven Colver I thought hey
Steve how far do you think I can
overclock 7900 XD let it on custom water
loop with an EVGA x29 a dark is he using
liquid middle number one yes
stealing it liquid metal I find pretty
far you can do like I think you do like
five no no is not like forces worth for
Saturday I do about five depending on
how good the quality is I you check this
cuz I was doing I'm dealin with custom
loop 790 DXE I had about four point
eight four nine and this is only ten
core so I close oh yeah yeah you know
what I always forget the Ted Kord so
yeah you could definitely do at least
five maybe I'm like a super trip maybe
yeah five one but I wouldn't expect any
higher than that
finally it's probably a good point but I
would be happy with yes axe he has
twenty dollars thank you very much hikes
is saw the core memory on the wall in
the earlier video a nicely placed thank
you yes it is right next to the testing
room cracks the two dollars got a poster
and good luck guys thank you we will
both sign it if you buy the posters
during
stream from store Nigeria sexist on that
and and we'll send them out to you all
right so what's has Cinebench nope hmm
alright yeah I think the pot is actually
kind of done do you think it's filled
with water or what no I think the paste
underneath so what I'm gonna do is heat
up real quick yeah we still have some
melon - yeah sure
I'm basically go back down again so just
to go over this to people who haven't
seen us do this yeah and by us I mean me
I'm actually doing this right apart yeah
so Joe I was doing all the work on this
he is going to heat the pot up and it's
is it fair to say it's sort of like
reflow in the thermal paste yeah I've
been trying to get the thermal paste on
so that way you can flow it down so yeah
basically unfreeze the paste is a good
really to explain now are you muted I
was gonna I might need it no now you're
getting a dress I just wanted to make
sure it was down the stock I want to
keep it the running system running so
that way it's heating from the outside
okay
that makes sense and we're using a cry
ona thermal grisly cry oh not on there
right now
hello a beard I'm hell of a man of hair
yes we're waiting on the wooden hunty
have Supergirl guys
seriously I'm excited for that
yes sir bird it's a plane it's super
beard so we got just to catch everyone
up I have the GPS set to about 190
9021 fifty megahertz I'd like to get up
to 2200 next time when I do this again
joke I won't be on that one
Joey you've been doing it all so you had
almost five nine on the CPU I ther and
uh and then mesh 36 something like that
35 37 37 mesh
oh no we're at 291 yeah join a 91
degrees Celsius yeah by that bias I'm
not correct
Oh a lot of stars
Mohammed from Michigan
sign in the store and 2 of the capital I
think we got Pierce from Texas picked up
toasters we had a Jason from Illinois
love for those how's your temperature
your socket temperature good now about
30 feet already see my core what what's
that mean okay
oh whoops it's a cool photorec night
anytime you heat it up and you go yeah
it's pretty cool up in there so I
practiced it got that one white zero
five dollars has Joe ever been burned by
Owens ooh yeah many times actually just
from stupid stuff just rub so if you're
boring a lot of pot to a lot of pots and
you see it like what we do here you take
it to a different level say if you have
three pots and you're doing it by
yourself
I've literally I poured it on I've had
like big burns like blisters Lister's
it's kind of like if you ever got burped
by like fire it's very very similar it
stings but I don't think your skin
doesn't really know the difference yeah
it feels the same it pretty much it
almost feels a little bit worse three of
us it's almost you got a finger in if
it's freezing its but it's basically
like instant yeah was it called uh well
pain-free way it's definitely defensive
pain what I was looking for that was
lash freeze or something know when
people like losing their toes and stuff
when they're not what is that call it
frostbite yeah it's like frost it's
definitely a frost bite and chew it
definitely sucks where do I go sanger
Gupta $40 thank you where do I go to
learn about overclocking well my channel
bearded hardware very hard way subscribe
below I'll give you some other
suggestions we do some like some
overclocking I mostly do it on air which
I find which I mean water just not
exotic well most people think like
that's kind of how you get in
overclocking in general you have to do
it on air and water and I would suggest
you do that before you even use liquid
nitrogen yes cuz otherwise you're just
gonna fail all the time
yeah and it's it's frustrating but as
long as you
you start within reason like on air you
can learn quickly and it's fun and
because you put them into your
increasing coal but you're also
increasing your variables of things that
oh yeah can happen for sure and and then
you can also go to actually hardcore
overclocking built so you know some
contractors great great content maker
dare bower on YouTube ger acht aue are
for hit their Bower
and there's others too but there's
there's would be some of my who's the
main top choices yeah for sure that's
what a mr. Bower at home right now I'm
sitting sitting behind his desk looked
at your ever thought going well is there
a good step on Z over each table is boss
Fester's in Aachen I love it
see now I learned German justice just
just a screw at Roman well that's
basically the only reason I use what I
learned well didn't you take it in high
school yes yeah see that fire trained in
high school semester would devour today
I started earlier yeah I knew it would
happen
we are almost down to here almost yeah
that's get involved we're gonna have to
try some grab - 50 so let's go back and
set the clocks again
oops little profile this one's not
completely fault that I'm gonna ration
us a bit whose chat saying you burn
stuff and you learn Frost and now
someone's ahead see frost enough frost
naw geo no no no I get that a lot
actually people would be like oh not
actually there was some thank you yeah I
always confuse that it's pretty funny I
always get a kick out of it
why not poor Allen towards the GPU if we
are not set up for that is set up for
hum for water right now yeah to be
honest we don't really have enough
liquid nitrogen to be able to do it cuz
you we go through you'll go through
liquid nitrogen with three pots we're
just doing one now and we're almost the
huh yeah and we're pretty much out so if
you had three go through way quicker all
right I love you speaking German this
flat German is cringe out of town thank
you darn good German well we've got
mixed opinions apparently I'm gonna
assume the one saying darn good speak
going to speak about the same level as I
do that oddly we should have a benchmark
in the Midwest apparently it's freezing
right now is that V Mary Fox Mary Fox
shall I called there Bauer and get him
in here call him up
call him up do it tell him to call me
send him the memo I don't know if he has
my number I'm sure he's probably I try
not to give it out to just anybody you
know well your number yeah oh it's not a
special
yeah especially not like not like we're
how important for trolling oh dude I
think we're down a ski dance yeah it's
not that chairman of voice
I'm gonna find out the word for done
seat or the equivalent in German they
know if you said it cuz that Germany
that would be awesome Catan maybe I
don't remember done to market Tom yeah I
think you probably might have water in
the socket okay it's definitely done ski
F for the lid oh yeah thanks
I mean whatever it's empty I don't see
any way of it that's so that's why
they've been saying F is for the lid
yeah this whole time with that yeah I
mean that's you do
welcome it's it's I know you're used to
this from doing what you do all these
years but like if anyone if you ever get
into YouTube there's this curve of like
wow the counts are really great I love
this too like you guys suck that's a man
they're pretty balanced now I'm liking
it too then it's like okay it's time to
to only read like the first hour of
college and then stop Mike stuff a store
order from Ian paired up a component
supposed to be that yeah thank you for
picking that up we'll go through super
chats here as well to close my own
probably don't send too many more in
because I do have to catch up why don't
you want to talk about what how you know
it's it's done how do I know it's done
yeah well every time I go in they always
I blows up I mean that blue screen of
death is that normally why huh is there
no really what what what what I thought
I mean I thought uh I thought
overclocking was about getting the
fastest blue screen that's what kingpin
did when I was with them the fastest
blue screen yeah here's pretty fast it's
like instant oh yeah but the road walk
Locker
Sabitha genome oh man I thought this is
positioned right at my face
well I think torch okay I don't want a
Michael Jackson hair Moe Asch I need a
Red Bull real quick hold on I'll be
right back Paul yeah hit f12 there's
nothing in that I want to pop but I
guess that's intentional right yeah we
don't need to heat it up I have a
feeling there's water in the socket
somehow so you gotta figure we've been
mentioned for a long period of time yes
and also all yesterday a lot of the time
as we know I try not to bench this long
in general I always try to basically
heat it up and make sure because you
don't want to kill your component right
it's to be honest it sucks when you do
it it's like the worst thing you'll have
like what are the best GPUs in the world
and all of a sudden dunsky
it's time that you're basically and I've
probably dropped a few tears all right
let's see that is what Roman said what's
up know that I real rip CPU that's right
when Joe is involved hey don't worry you
know Roman or if Roman touches the CV
with killed three of the Red River
pretty much everybody yeah yeah 99 a DXE
you talking smack about me I see how it
is I remember that
I don't know if anybody knows but he has
a GTR no actually I had a DTR - they're
actually pretty cool cars yes Roman
Roman can kill him because he can go -
case can say bitte bitte I'd smear pizza
newer lines there have you ever been
over there have you ever got the tours I
have not been the canteen it's actually
a pretty cool place I got to meet a lot
of them though they're they're great
people they are definitely great people
they're one of my favorites for sure
so we got some normal chats your ski I
need a beer skier ski great effort guys
post some scores and specs when you
don't well I'll post this patch here
we'll do a recap video and talk about
what we went through here today so there
will be a shorter recap
Joe's channel update and past 2k let me
back into KJ yeah it drops for a second
it was probably YouTube so when you get
a big spike of subs they go through and
double check or something yeah but also
it's just not fully accurate
the real-time counter that's not really
accurate till tomorrow for my prediction
more predict same for for real-time
views it's kind of an accurate O'Dare GT
gar well oh the GTR they're saying oh
the GTR I don't know if I'm supposed to
say it but gotta bring it says profile
pictures it's gonna be his profile pic
this
there's German German yes there's that
German there's a Roman German their
power his name is not German where is he
they're Bauer Roman right there well
invite you guys over to us we I'd be
happy to tour I'm sure you would be too
why I was over there for a little bit I
didn't I was in the winter I want to go
in the summer or do anything it's an
awesome place it's very very very very
cool I don't know if you guys know at
caseking it's like a warehouse or what
well they're like a whole different
place to to uh Romans got a pretty cool
lab over there oh yeah if I got to visit
his lab it was very cool I was uh he's
got a bunch of cool goodies and things
all over I mean most of it that that's
probably the definition of Hardware born
to be honest yeah Sherman does good work
mr. dare Bauer he isn't chat if you guys
don't know who he is subscribed to him
as well so you think it's done ski still
well we'll see I'm just uh I went back
at the vault don't know if it's sitting
where were we so successfully where we
been we've successfully benched like
five point about five eight on the CPU
5860 or something yeah I think it was
like a well I think we we did about 58
and then we pushed it again and then it
fails okay so so got a 101 BCL K and a
57 was a fifty seven o'clock 101 on the
B o'clock I think that one was 36 on
mesh the voltages were about to four on
input about 1 5 6 - 1 5 8 on the CPU
bright voltage and then I think mesh was
about 1.3 - and then I think that's
about it cool yeah I mean it's pretty
solid actually yeah to be honest I think
if you lap that you'd probably do better
yeah it's I mean it's not laughs it's
got like a 40 Delta quarter core I'm
involved so you've educated everyone
that means that it's my father if and
even though I haven't touched up your 15
minutes
chad mccain update on these smaller
medium odd mats yeah the the mediums are
actually on the way to us they're made
how big is the medium is it half the
size of this it's 32 by 16 yeah all
right I must say these are pretty cool
if you want to take home if you want it
yeah 32 by 16 for the new one should I
get an autographed what I think so just
makes fun of me while I say yes come on
we're gonna be exciting stuff so you
might as well yeah might as well
why I'll do it invite the Bauer dammit
he's welcome to come over he's going to
Rowan's gonna be uh over here at some
point for another show or something I'm
sure so that one with that next big PC
show is in PAX East Computex PAX East
our I doubt he's gonna be that smart
like you can't you mean the same as part
of a gaming one right yeah they're
probably copy dicks I think most of us
are gonna be a couple oh yeah we'll do
videos we'll definitely have to meet up
at g-scale or something yeah definitely
cuz I know I do I have to do a lot for
the Juicin competition this year that's
one of the biggest I see events I'll do
it and someone needs you I think you
should probably provide some coverage on
them we do that yeah or we do because I
do a lot of the judging there so it's
gonna be more a lot of work for me right
it's a great event and if you're into
the extreme overclocking it's probably
it's one of the hardest events for
memories got cash prizes right that cash
prize I think you 10k cash like yeah
it's pretty pretty it's a grueling
contest too and we're gonna change up
some things so it's gonna be pretty
awesome so even if you want to you can
actually join it if it there'll be an
online qualifier on HW bot so we're in
the works now probably within the next
month will will provide a bunch of no
that'd be cool you'll see it on my
channel anyway I'll be providing
coverage on it on the online qualifiers
right then the actual live qualifiers
what's the status of this right now yeah
I think it needs to be dried out do you
want to like go through
mounting the pot and show everyone kind
of like that process or you want to
leave it on there um you can i don't
recommend like when you're heating up
and stuff you should always pull up the
pot and dry hmm see we're at minus 23
but what muscle I put it back this not
clocks right
it's probably nothing's really gonna
happen to it just uh when you start
seeing funky things happen so remember
what I said before about like your
overclocking on water it you have a
certain variables well I'm liquid
nitrogen you start you want to kind of
limit your variables so you want to make
sure everything is running on air water
and that way you don't introduce any
more variables so because when you put
liquid nitrogen all of a sudden you
start weirdest things will start
happening you'll have water that may be
creeped into like one of the memories
lots or into the CPU itself and things
like it will run to fall and but as soon
as you start pushing it and it fails and
then you'll start like ripping all the
beard hair oh yeah your hair everywhere
and going crazy so that's a common
symptoms yeah if you see beard hair
everywhere for more than four hours I
failed and saw your dad there Stephen we
already discussed that I will come over
to GN yeah so I think that so we should
get Roman over here we got you up here -
I'm agree okay Roman over here and we'll
do a ribbed or bower stream and he will
host it that would be even better
Oh Mike will make their Bower rip
himself under my account name I love
that because he just has no competition
so yeah it's taking it then came Ben oh
but if I had cards I would yeah we go
here it's pretty hard to beat that you
know yeah
porky not EVGA let's let's go through so
we're gonna cut off the super chats here
357 as the as per the clock on the
computer and I'm just gonna read through
we've got about 30 minutes worth of
messages I don't think it'll take more
than ten minutes to go through okay so
what questions are better tats yeah if
you I'll give you like another
three-minute window if you have a
question
hopefully overclocking related because
Jo's an expert we have them here if you
have an OC question please post it and
if for some reason I miss it we're gonna
do a video after I think and just talk
about some basics yeah so this is a
great opportunity for you to to learn
from someone who's been doing it for
like a decade so too long
No Jana Sodor missed five dollars
greetings from Finland
from a fellow bearded dude keep up the
great work guys love beards thank you
Richard doll in three dollars what's the
best to slot 2084 air-cooling hustle I
built two slots hard but aren't many of
them I can't even think of the names of
them right now I can't think of it
they're like the Strix is 2.8 XE ultras
2.8 oh I think there's an X e to I don't
know if it's out yeah there's like an X
e to or something that's gonna be 2 slot
20s are pretty hot though so it's a
little challenging I'm sorry I don't
have a better answer I haven't memorized
them all and every single one we have is
like three slots yeah so I always water
cool it and then you have to worry about
it then yeah then you can go down to one
slot if you like that faff about 99 have
you guys seen the 2700 Oksana Helen -
got 6 gigahertz any thoughts I'm doing a
29 50 X Allen's who or someone in the
future what are your thoughts on am the
Alan T overclocking um well they slack
really bad right now but the new ones
that are probably coming is gonna be
obviously there's supposed to be better
from what I hear do you think for
overclocking as well not just for stock
what is still I mean it's cheap
overclocking hmm I mean you're getting
budget overclocking if you ever want to
get into learning cuz you know when I
just go by an idea maybe X for 2 grand
and then kill the chip you're gonna
learn a know see that things die and you
gotta get used to it pretty quick so
rising with overclocking it's gonna be
you're gonna do less than on an Intel
chip but it for the budget it's actually
pretty much killer and now that
supposedly the newer ones are coming out
I've only expected to get better usually
as the process matures they usually get
better for sure yeah I I don't think
it's a bad thing at all I think it's
kind of an exciting time specially for
overclocking it's gonna be a Andy I
think we'll we'll kind of own the show
at Computex but we'll see those right
that's what everybody's kind of thinking
as far as what's gonna be the big big
bonus right compu decks are Clifton Ward
$3 thoughts on stevie ray vaughan love
the stream Stevie Ray Vaughan's good are
so velocity V $5 good personal friend of
yours Stevie Ray Vaughn yeah I just look
good I swallow hair item
I don't know what that means I swallow
now okay this stop don't read the rest
of them yeah I understand that
yeah finish front seat racing SEK 20
thank you bastard
five dollars well either of you be
interested in seeing how the rise in
three thousand trees I think we just
answered that OSI is on Alan tirana
corner we can try it out I mean I'll
have them so if you don't have you come
up or I'm sure yeah I know I'd come up
and put yeah we'll get them Daniel
Cassie two dollars grab the poster thank
you also not gladly rip competition it
will continue
techno creeper $4.99 how is the Mod map
Mini going any reason my red devil gets
2/5 85 degree Celsius other than the
fact that it needs some cryo not medium
on Matt is on its way here and I haven't
pretty listed it for a pre-orders or
anything and we're gonna quality check I
might look through personally a whole
bunch of um and then we'll list it Red
Devil 85 degrees I mean Vega gets is
kind of hot and you could maybe tune the
fan trip a bit well water yeah there's
the thing so we even with cheap any GPU
you buy I highly recommend ripping the
cooler off and replacing pace I've seen
some of the crappiest from the
manufactures the crappiest pace jobs so
but like my de facto standard when I go
through a video card the first thing I
do even most of time before it usually
what you should do is test it make sure
it works first and then pull off the
cover and replace base just just do it
you'll see dramatic results from it yeah
and we had a red dragon card that was a
red devil that when I pulled the cooler
off the past was not contacting the hpm
like it there was zero contact the HBM
no I don't know what the manufacturers
do but I've seen I've seen them pretty
much from every man event the paste
application is just terrible so I've
been done even when I had some like
Titan B's I took them off a lot of
people don't know that those cards are
assembled by hand to a lot of videos
almost all of it is Dante armor armor
O's tacked to Dodge bearded barbarian
and Tech Jesus Allen
disaster Oh your hair gasps was the L&amp;amp;T
disaster this time for real riding five
times do you see Nvidia dropping a GTX
eighteen eighty TI non twenty 80 TI that
is actually affordable for the 99% I
don't think so I think we'll see 16 and
I think it's gonna stop there I think
for the rest you have 20 70 80 and 80 TI
because the stack is already so dense
yeah I don't I don't see that reason
like but you never do I mean maybe if
the 27 sells horribly but because if
they do a 20 an 18 80 TI would have to
be the price of a 20 80 and then that
kills the 20 80 so like yeah I don't I
don't I don't know because even with the
what aim these new stuff that came out I
don't I I just don't see some they're
not under a ton of pressure rather than
from themselves right now yeah it's it's
all about that's pretty much a
beautifully fast means it well Jensen's
not really helping things either yeah
ister it just works asteroid I see K
that sounds like a 45 hour times during
the glorious stream it just works it
does not just work asteroid SEK 20 is
there seen for OC and older and cheaper
hardware hell yeah no seriously actually
this is a huge thing specially on HW
bought when as far as further to be
honest if you want to get into
overclocking there's nothing better than
buying old hardware because you'll feel
way better about yourself
if they able to sleep at night cuz you
only spend a certain amount of money and
stuff so to be honest a lot of people do
it it's kind of uh I don't know what the
word it's like its own depository
division yeah people are like really
sick into it like you got guys and even
though to be honest it's actually not
needed on some specific components it
can actually be even more expensive than
newer components because they're so
highly limited on what you can get but
the trick is to really find kind of the
niche of what's cheap like the extra 79
CPUs and stuff like that I'm not so sure
on that I think there's definitely a bit
cheaper than yeah there for sure than
the modern stuff but yeah that's a great
great question
yes definitely yeah and I mean it it's
you don't have to start here either you
guys have seen me the others without any
onto and then we
water and then to ice and it's a lot of
fun you can step through gradually JP
stone five daughters have either of you
XO seed risin if not would you love
gianni of the best merge thank you
I don't know how I built pcs without I'm
hot fat while you're plugging it form a
store that gamers Nexus dotnet if you
wanna pick them up they'll ship next
week or end of this week have you XO see
dries I haven't even touched Verizon to
be honest okay I don't mean I won't
though right yeah it's not a not a
comment against right no no I haven't
done it well the Intel stuff Cox very
well and I have certain amount of
budgeted time that I can donate to it so
but that I'm definitely not you already
you already know it Terry it's a bit
different there overclocked right yeah
it's not it's since I'm I been July
intel has been the leader for a while
now so a lot of the overclockers are
more used to it than before we can see
guys really upset about that we're just
talking overclocking we're not saying
like yeah rise and obviously has
tremendous value in the the places well
the value is killer if yeah yeah
definitely definitely not it gives it
but we can look into extra seen rise and
maybe with the new generation Kyle
Knight $5 what cpu are you running today
99 80 XE person even $4.99 we're almost
to the end here trying to set up an MT
raid zero on my Amazon x-29 board since
TR uses two dies do I have to do
anything specific to make it work I
don't think so but and I'm trying to set
up an m2 raid zero on my board
yeah since TR uses two dies do I have to
do anything why would you have to make
anything work I understand well like
that I guess I owe is split off a bit
versus a monolithic die but I don't know
I have to read that button so Mady so
huh yeah I mean I don't do anything with
storage so I don't know but I don't
think so chat I'm sure chat please jump
in and let lets question I'm gonna
probably looking at my own time queue
Romans done a video on that too Kyle
only eight five dollars could you review
the Corsair 450d you'll have to see what
stacks up on the airflow focus PC cases
no current plans especially if it's not
brand new but we have a lot of cases on
there you can probably kind of figure it
out based on what it's similar to Jim
early $10 no massive thank you we only
have a few more here and then we'll kind
of start closing out I'm CP 199 how far
can
700k with a CSD 390 prime in h1 15 I go
I think the banana chip quality gets
like 5 1 or something for sure it's 180
millimeter CLC would say H 1 1 5
probably yeah I would say it depends
because within 90 say 9700 K is no
hyper-threading so you're gonna be
cooler yeah it's gonna you're talking
soldered so 5 1 it depends on the
quality a chip but 5 gig would
definitely do and a better chip anywhere
from five one two five two and we had a
280 CLC on ours I have five one five two
no issues and that's daily that's not
just overclocking maybe if you want to
bench like r15 you could probably hit
five three or five four you're right
even ninety nine hundred case it will
hit that wishbone two dollars please buy
the obsessive underwear for Jay and
Derek's the obsessive underwear do I
even one another in our news video we
had a scrolling shot of a website when
the ads was like men are obsessed with
this underwear everybody looked at while
it scrolled by yeah there's some creepy
ones I see them all over no you know DC
500 I don't know if that's the N thanks
for keeping me company while I pull an
all-nighter well thank you for joining
us we pull basically an all-nighter
because we were up all night last night
and then trying to get it to work if it
was very challenging to get this system
working sergeant Zeta we only have two
left here five dollars
I was 78 hundred oxen azeroth cozy
formula someone offered to trade me
their extra dark is it worth tearing up
loop apart for the dark both they're
good boards I think it really depends on
what you want to do I think dark has
some features for daily that's a little
bit better but the OC formula is
actually I've broken or a bunch of
records on that put that board so I
can't really say anything bad about it's
a great boy really capable it's one of
my favorite boards to be honest didn't
so is the dark so to be honest you
you're good with both home yeah so I
guess depends on do you wanna put the
effort in yeah I think that when it
comes down to is maybe like I think this
is the dark come with Wi-Fi or anything
like that I don't remember so it's got a
spot for it I don't know if a hell yeah
I think certain features I think it's
really gonna be if the if one board has
better features that's pretty much right
now last one day make five dollars I
want to start water cooling do you have
a brand recommendation for nine
okay closed loops easy they're all
pretty much the same by heyse attack
there are a couple new ones like cool
it's made some for course here the the
Platinum Series I think it's called and
so that's easy by what you think looks
good check our charts see what performs
best and buy that one but open loop I
mean I know I don't want to speak for
Jay but Jay has a lot of recommendations
he's the definitive expert in YouTube
space on water clean open loop do you
have any thoughts I mean do you work
with water cooling at all regularly um
well I do work it a lot yeah I mean
there's just like throw a loop together
for paltrow a loop but I usually take
one part from here one part here so I'll
take a pump from here I'm gonna actually
be getting into a lot of that going
through different vendors and doing some
of that too so you'll see some info on
that but at this moment I don't have too
much to say to him I know that I did a
video with Jay on the channel search for
Jays two cents
like his name full one word and find our
videos we have a great video with him
outside of LTX Linus's expo i spoke with
him for like 20 minutes about that exact
question what are your recommendations
what kind of issues don't run into with
these and really good content for that
and he's the expert i use so for
open-loop we we kind of use whatever
we're given for the most part but i have
not had any issues with like EK is
double d DC is a great pump it's noisy
but it's good for pushing long just I'm
feeling pretty good yeah and then it's
amazing yes well that's pushing water
through a gigantic radiator yeah up a
hill all that stuff yeah it's quite
impressive pump actually water cool the
company makes some really good stuff
like the Mora but it is expensive
everybody you pay for what you get on
that thing thing is very impressive when
I throw it on a turbo car yeah do a
water dare set up yeah a turbocharger so
what's the often what's chat saying here
anything
Roman says I remember Steve saying the
comments will downgrade the counts will
downgrade at a certain point I think
when I heard underwear it was the time
he's right yeah I think so okay um well
yeah so like
said if you buy a poster during the
stream we're about to end here but if
you buy one during the stream before it
ends will sign it both of us send it out
I don't know how many throw to sign
we'll find out um I'm scared thank you
for for the store purchases with super
chats and everything kick-starting
bearded hardware much appreciated here
and obviously you'll see me a bearded
hardware and link below to subscribe to
him will do more you're only in Florida
it's not too far so we'll do it together
definitely and I appreciate you having
me on
absolutely thank you for joining and
then then you told you can pick stuff up
I don't know if you have more questions
we'll do like a stream recap maybe we
might do a short video Joe might do a
video for his channel yeah so you'll
learn more to watch yeah that's the view
so thank you all for watching let's
let's just for anybody to skip to the
very end let's recap what we got on the
CPU so about 5 8 gigahertz be different
died about five eight and the CPU is
still functional but the overclock died
because I think the pots got water in it
or something I think the CPU probably
has a little bit of water in it yeah so
we're it's we'll do it again later but
about five eight memory we never talked
about it's at like 300 and 600 Co 1212
which is really good doing that to 40
odd T RFC write some basic time in so I
think the art eels are like 53 53 mmm
and then tighten our TX is I had it
offset 190 cores there's about 2015 21
50 megahertz and memory goes offset by
12 20 and I have some more work to do
there so yeah so a great stream thank
you all for watching we appreciate it we
had a lot of fun and check out Joe in
the description we'll see you all next
