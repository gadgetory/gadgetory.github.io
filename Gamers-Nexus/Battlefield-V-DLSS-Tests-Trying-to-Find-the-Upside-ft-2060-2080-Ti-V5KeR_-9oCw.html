with we're going through another game
test now it's been several days of these
we're looking at battlefield 5d LSS we
actually started this several days ago
and we push the content back a couple
extra days to look deeper and try and
find something positive with DL SS we're
sure you've seen the criticism online we
were working on our content at about the
same time as everyone else working on it
and after seeing the sort of global
response the DL SS basically being
Vaseline on the screen we decided to
just do anything to try and find a more
just something that made it well look
better so we tested our TX 2060s 2080
eyes we did a couple of different game
graphics settings we did multiplayer
single-player stuff like that trying to
find the good in DL SS and well we're
not completely empty-handed but let's
just talk about it in this one and do
qualitative and quantitative tests with
DL SS in bfv before that this video is
brought to you by the gigabyte Z 390 ARS
master motherboard which comes equipped
with one of the more powerful Z 390 VRMs
for heavier overclocks on the new 9th
gen intel cpus the ARS master is also
one of the few motherboards with a real
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented cover blocks oh and it's also
got updated our DV illumination
learn more at the link below in working
with DL SS which requires DX r to be
enabled and does not have an off option
for ray-tracing
we've noticed that there seems to be
some sort of gradual memory leak in
battlefield 5 with DXR enabled we
haven't been able to confirm this with
100% consistency or confidence but it
happens enough that we're at least
somewhat confident and talking about it
as an issue over a period of time
related to the GPU memory available the
game seems to eventually slow to a bit
of a crawl we noticed this most
prominently on the maps devastation and
Rotterdam the RT X 2060 had even just
1080p with lo DX our settings would
bottom out at 0 FPS for long intervals
sometimes completely crashing this seems
to coincide with memory filling up but
it wasn't just that the 2060 was doing
it because of a 6
might limit or something our twenty atti
with the XR on the higher two options
also begins to encounter hard stutters
occasionally in testing we have not been
able to reproduce this issue with DX R
and D LSS both disabled but we have
reproduced it on two systems with two
different RT X GPUs with some
consistency but not 100% consistency the
memory seems to be fully allocated on
each device when this happens so our
speculation and it is pure speculation
mind you so we may be wrong on this is
that it's a memory leak of some kind
within the game code the 2080 TI will
sometimes take 20 minutes to start
encountering these occasional stutters
so we don't see it in our brief test
passes and then as a side note with DX R
in Unreal Engine we've noticed that
there is a similar sort of slow down
over time so this may just be a DXR
issue within Windows that would be
Microsoft's domain and they actually
make a DX R and then Nvidia plugs into
that so it may be a wider issue with the
XR but either way we wanted to point out
that there are occasional memory leak
issues in battlefield 5 with DX r
enabled and that would also go with DL
SS being enabled we're going to put some
DL SS on and off comparisons on the
screen now but we won't reveal which is
which and what the resolution settings
are until the end you should look at
this and personally determine which you
think looks best
then we'll reveal which is which later
will keep the left and the right
consistently one setting so that they
remain the same as we change footage of
screenshots you just pick which side you
think is the best looking at DL SS from
the perspective of quality our very
first impression was that the
differences it were difficult to see an
actual gameplay like DX r ray tracing
when you're actually playing the game
battlefield 5 these things sort of get
overlooked in favor of while playing the
game as we use D LSS more across more
maps and began to really scrutinize it
sometimes with the face is one inch away
from the monitor we noticed that it
almost seems to remove a sharpening
filter and then as you sort of sit back
and look at it wider you don't need to
be that close to the monitor to notice
the lack of the sharpening because once
movement slows down once you stop
running around and you just camp
somewhere for a second which is real
gameplay you'll notice that it looks
sort of blurry
and this effect this blurry or blurring
or lack of sharpening becomes more
noticeable as you look for it or as you
become aware of it so this is not
something that we noticed immediately
but of course noticed within well a
couple of minutes of actually playing
around and looking at it so we're not
sure if there's a literal transaction
going on where there's a sharpening
filter or a post processed sharpening
effect that's being applied and then
removed with the LSS but in before and
after comparisons we have of rotterdam
devastation the shooting range and
single player we noticed that DL SS off
shots always look like they're
significantly sharper than the LS s on
this is not good or bad really it's sort
of subjective but in general most people
do tend to like the contrast or the
sharpness based on comments online about
this issue so you can look at this two
ways either there's some sort of
sharpening post process that happens
with DL SS off and that's removed with
TLS is on or that isn't true at all
and DL SS just does this and that's
probably the worse of the two options
given those two let's reveal which side
has been using which settings now if you
chose one and now disagree with your
choice that may be a bias if you
couldn't tell the difference between
them that's also noteworthy because then
you should clearly just use whichever is
better and so far as performance
benchmarks and that's always going to be
the lower resolution with DL SS off
giving you better performance and really
in a lot of instances either
indistinguishable or better visual
quality depending on your preferences
and of course YouTube compression might
also kill any minor differences so
that's of course a consideration as well
back to it though the idea is that DL SS
should make it easier to run DXR we've
already seen that this is objectively
true NVIDIA has done well with
delivering on that promise but it's
still even easier suggest E is the next
resolution class down when speaking
strictly to performance and the looks as
we've shown are either not that
different or are maybe a little bit
better with that lower resolution
although you might not like the
sharpness there's some instances where
we can see DL SS being better and we'll
talk about those in a bit we already
showed some charts for that stuff what
we need more of is qualitative versions
of this discussion so here's your point
of consideration the lower resolution
and DL SS off tests like 1440p instead
of 4k d LSS still show sharper objects
than with DL SS enabled and 4k
resolution after Nvidia's blog post we
also decided to test the r-tx 2064 this
with 1080p and 1440p we thought maybe
maybe this one would be better would
have either better quality or make more
sense because it's a lower end car this
set of tests also however showed us that
the D LSS images were less sharp they
were in some instances just plain blurry
almost like there's a constant layer of
motion blur applied even when the
camera's not in motion we saw something
similar in the initial execution in
Metro where we it looks sort of like
with our TX GI on there's that layer of
motion blur DLS s also impacts the
object render distance where some
objects get completely cold with TLS s
on this is something we noticed in the
single-player French campaign level in
the mud distant trees for example we're
getting cold with TLS s but remains
present with the LS s off there were
only a few objects where this happened
but it did happen and of course the more
you play the game than where you'll find
of those in the same vein DLS s impact
LOD scaling and object detail and
distant objects visible plainly and some
of the neighboring trees in those clips
earlier we can see that the branches
sort of pop in and out you lose some of
the height or the depth of the trees
depending on the LOD scaling we wanted
to wrap our content here originally but
figured that there had to be a benefit
somewhere so we looked and we looked and
we searched on multiple GPUs and after
suffering some memory leak issues we
eventually found an area of debatable
improvement in the multiplayer map on
rotterdam shot from the spectator view
in the clouds we noticed that the thin
geometric detail on ships like the masts
and on the train would alias heavily
with DL SS off and running 1080p
remember this is an RT X 2060 so it's
realistic you would run that resolution
this was aliasing to the point where
there's almost a marching ants effect as
you move around it could be considered
annoying maybe if you're really looking
at that with DL SS on in 1440p those
objects either get sampled out and
omitted maybe not the best or get
smoothed out depending on which object
it is and how much data there is for the
LSS to work with this is not necessarily
good or bad in an objective form but it
is something for you to determine the
value of in general if you have to look
that hard for a positive difference it's
probably worth just leaving it off in
our previous DL SS benchmark with Final
Fantasy 15 we found that 1440p
resolution always produced better
performance than 1440p with DL SS faking
4k and super sampling which we can show
again on the screen now in that video we
also talked about the pros and cons of
each configuration sometimes like with
the license-plate text that we showed in
the Final Fantasy benchmark DL SS was
arguably better for legibility than just
straight 1440p but of course 4k was
better than both unsurprisingly it was
worse always than real for cable that's
because DL SS is meant to sort of fake
4k and improve your framerate at the
same time which is what we're looking at
today in other instances the LSS was
significantly worse than 1440p like
where we had flickering and fences and
light fixtures
whereas 1440p looked normal and without
those anomalies we talked about much of
this and chalked it up to a semi random
seed being generated to alternate where
on the screen the LSS was sampling this
we assumed was true because even when
paused the menu screens would still show
flickering and objects that have really
thin geometry or are just maybe using
alpha textures or something like that
both of which can describe the fences
where we saw a flickering so the example
of flickering when paused does coincide
with maybe some sort of semi
randomization in the sampling pattern or
something like that since it's not fixed
but when in movement it makes more sense
that it is flickering as it is because
you're starting to sample around these
really thin pieces of geometry or really
thin elements like in the fences in a
way that it might just slightly miss the
actual piece of metal hit some of the
background and then you get a super
sampling of that which is no longer
accurate so that explains the flickering
in that game we didn't see it quite the
same as we talked about earlier for
Battlefield 5 but for Battlefield 5 our
first benchmark sequence will look at
one of the more intensive single-player
levels and ultra presets for the 2080 ti
but with our TX only set too low we'll
look at our TX ultra next for this one
1440p with TLS has often our TX at low
once again chart tops but that isn't
really surprising at all the question as
we answered earlier is more about what
looks better this is the other half of
that equation though with DL SS off
we're at 82 FPS average with lows
reasonably x at 59 FPS 1% 55 FPS 0.1%
using again our 1440p setting where you
actually can't enabled ELSS if you
wanted it our standard deviation is
minimal in these tests as you can see
the bars on the graph so these numbers
are a fairly consistent run to run the
82 FPS average puts us at 9 present
faster than 4k with DL SS off but with
RT X completely disabled if you want it
to play at true 4k at a reasonable frame
rate clearly it's possible by completely
disabling RT X and just using normal in
quotes their game graphics settings
enabling RT X but keeping DLS s off
drops us to 52 FPS average so
like-for-like
we dropped from 75 to 52 FPS and lose
30% of our performance instantly with RT
x set to low this isn't a scene that
doesn't have much actual ray-traced
reflections there's not really a lot
going on for ray-traced reflections it's
constantly processing but that doesn't
mean it's really showing you anything
and that's not to mention some of the
visual artifacts that we can show as
well like fire shimmering and the camera
despite no fire being actually nearby or
relevant to our viewport the comeback
story is with DL SS sort of where we
instantly gain 27% performance to 66 FPS
average from 52 FPS average even still
this is worse than 1440p with TLS s off
and RT x low unsurprisingly and worse
than just disabling RT x and playing
with 4k instead it all comes down to
image quality and we'll put one of those
comparisons back on the screen now if
1440p with TLS s off looks worse than 4k
with the LS s on and it's noticeable and
frequently worse then TLS s is worth it
if not it's clearly not worth it we've
given you the tools to decide for
yourself what you think but we'll loop
back on this more on the conclusion
let's look at the next test and it's in
the same area except it's now with our
TX set to ultra from low so all this is
the same except our TX 75 FPS average is
the high set by 4 KD LSS off and our TX
completely disabled this now surpasses
1440p and this particular test as
opposed to the previous one and that's
because the 1440p tests are now working
with our TX set two altra instead of low
the end results is that we lose 20% of
our performance from the previous charts
82 FPS average high now ranking below 4k
with the LSS often our TX completely
disabled big important note there if you
wanted to keep our TX on you could
either take 1440p and our TX ultra or 4k
with the LS s on and to some extent our
TX ultra which lands us at 54 FAS
average this is still worse than 1440p
baseline which had us at a 21% higher
frame rate if you wanted a more like for
like comparison going from 4k with the
LSS off at 37 FPS average to 4k with the
LSS on did provide a noteworthy
improvement to 45% that's a damn good
jump it's just that 1440p is probably
still better or functionally equivalent
for most people so at that point we
question whether the gain matters in
this particular game that said as a
technology clearly there's an op lift
and performance here it's not really
that new of a technology the
implementation is new but the idea isn't
so there is a gain it's a big gain -
it's just that it's not you're losing
some image quality there so maybe this
is promising for other applications we
just need to see if those ever come to
fruition and be convinced from an image
quality standpoint the performance
standpoint there's a good argument we
really need to see that image quality
standpoint though finally just for one
more charted area we also tested the
practice range for the opposite load
level of the previous single player
level the practice range is probably the
lightest weight area of the game it's
not really that representative of actual
play but it's still useful for just kind
of the opposite end of things so this
almost never uses RTS reflections we
thought we'd look at it as a performance
trial 1440p leads once again although
FPS scales higher in all tests as a
result of the simpler environment we're
at 103 FPS average with well time to
load
versus DL SS off RTX off and 4k at 90
FPS average with 4k DLS s off
we are applauding about 56 FPS average
still a steep decline from the 78 FPS
average with DL SS on let's instead look
at frame time performance as always
frame time plots are useful for their
more accurate representation of frame to
frame performance rather than
potentially averaging out any important
data points lower is better for frame to
frame interval shown as frame times on
the Left axis but more consistent is
better still than lower for this one we
can first plot 4k with DL SS off and RT
X on showing frame x between 22
milliseconds and about 37 milliseconds
the frame to frame variants which is
what we actually care about isn't all
that bad here there are a few spikes
greater than the desirable sub 8
millisecond variants but overall the
so-called smoothness is fine it's not
high frame rate so that's not great but
the consistency is acceptable for
reference sixteen point six 67
milliseconds is about 60 fps for the 4k
DLS s on test drawing that line now we
see performance significantly improve
over DL SS off and those a few larger
frame time spikes also now vanish with
this run reducing the workload on the
GPU overall helps to ensure more
consistency frame to frame which is also
significantly advantageous vs. 4k with
the LS s off so it appears that DL SS is
working it's doing well for performance
it's just that there's those other
problems so again this option does not
exist in a vacuum and 1440p posts better
frame rates with similar frame to frame
intervals resulting in the best overall
experience in fact the frames of frame
intervals are better on average by at
least a couple of milliseconds the
longer the line the higher the FPS here
and of course the shorter the line is on
the Left axis the lower the frame time
also a good thing so we see that the
1440p line ends up with the most frames
drawn it has the best frame rate it's
also the most consistent so really it's
just objectively the best and so far as
performance so going back to the image
quality scenario is the only fallback
for DL SS and this illustrates well why
for
40p remains the best option in this use
case from at least an objective
standpoint that's what we have for you
then so we had I guess memory issues
notwithstanding which do seem like they
might be just related to DXR and Windows
in general because we're having those
issues in Unreal Engine 2 so those
things notwithstanding DL SS it's just
at a point where it's like even editing
back the video Andrew was saying he
could barely tell the difference and
when we were playing the game we could
barely tell the difference until you
have to stop and look and then yes you
can see it but like when when we first
started playing the game and you're
actually playing it like for real not
just walking around aimlessly trying to
find differences you're actually playing
the game the differences are very
difficult to spot because a lot of the
time it amounts to some blurring of the
textures some loss of detail some of the
sharpening is gone but a lot of the time
those elements aren't things you're
really paying attention to when you're
trying to shoot people in the game so so
the difference is overall in action are
not that noticeable and that's not
really a good thing it might sound like
a good thing
in some ways because we're not saying
it's worse or well noticeably worse when
you're really playing but it's really
not a good thing because again you can
drop the resolution you can get better
performance uplift as a result of it
because it's just it's straight 1440
instead of 1440 super sampled which is
what DL SS is and so because it's
straight 1440 performances up and then
it's a bit sharper things like that now
sharpness is sort of up to debate to
some extent whether you'd like it or not
we showed footage earlier but for the
most part you really do have to just
like kind of pause and look really close
to the monitor to try and see those
differences when you're first trying to
spot them but when do you see them and
it is really obvious like once you start
noticing the differences suddenly you
can't not see them so definitely
DL SS is overall lower image quality we
would say to some extent objectively on
the subjective side there are some
debatable areas of improvement
like maybe for example in the masts in
the ships in some of the train prefab
elements stuff like that small mesh
details things where it's it's really
thin geometry there's not much geometric
complexity there or maybe an alpha
texture or something like that you start
seeing some debatable improvement and
that's mostly and just either either it
misses when it samples and it doesn't
hit the small piece of geometry it
samples everywhere around it and then
you lose that contact so it doesn't get
drawn in the super sampled version or
you hit it and it gets almost like
emboldened in which at which point the
the aliasing issues go away with the
marching ants effect on those masts and
other thin geometric elements or alpha
textures or whatever so that's kind of
what we're dealing with it's it comes
back to the same philosophical thing
that some of the other stuff we've
looked at with our TX where if there is
some sort of improvement but you have to
look really hard to fight you have to do
what we're doing for a job to find it
then does it matter and if there's a
performance uplift and there's an
arguable maybe sometimes improvement
sure turn it on but if there is not a
performance out there's actually
detriment and the benefit is exceedingly
rare or completely subjective that's
where it gets either easy to say turn it
off and just drop the resolution or if
it's subjective then I'll have easily
look at it figure it out if you like one
more now overall reading the comments
online
it looks like the verdict is more or
less that people don't like DL SS in
battlefield 5 we don't really have a
extremely firm stance on this one it's
not it is not impressive it is not
necessarily adding meaning it's well
let's rephrase that it is not adding
meaningfully to performance that's very
firm so then it just comes down to does
it add to the look and really overall
the answer's no not really because the
only way by and large for most scenarios
in the game that it benefits the visuals
is if you don't like the sharpness if
you maybe you feel like the sharpness
and
battlefield is unrealistic and maybe you
feel like it should be a bit blurrier or
at least less defined and that's
potentially a valid criticism
so in that case sure turned it on but
it's kind of the wrong reason to turn it
on so that's really where the the
problem is is it's that's not that's not
what's supposed to that's how the
benefit that's intended so so if there's
benefit there absolutely feel free to
use it we're not telling you not to but
it's just it does not seem to be quite
what we were expecting and NVIDIA
interestingly has painted itself into a
corner because it promised the world
when it brought this technology on to
display in Germany and people are now
expecting Nvidia to do what they said
you know would happen and it's just not
it's not there yet so maybe the OSS will
get there some of this stuff is just
it's a matter of like not losing some of
the detail this is a technology that's
supposed to improve over time it has fed
more ground truth images and improved in
that way but it is still it remains to
be seen how good the LSS can be if we
can get to really where it needs to be
final fantasy we showed previously
trophy clips in this video and it just
was not on average a very good
experience to enable because you start
getting flickering and dissipating
objects and thin mesh materials
disappearing LOD scaling changes
sometimes unfavorably when you could
just drop resolution call it a day
so not particularly impressed it's not
the worst thing in the world but it's
just either there's you don't notice the
difference or you don't like it and
neither of those is a great option
because performance is down regardless
so that's it for this one thank you for
