next to stop Matt I'm here to play we
are here to play grapple today Wow all
of those words came out in one huge
jumbled and grapple was covered in one
of our first green light spotlight
episodes i can't remember it's it's a 3d
platformer i don't remember which
episode we covered it in but it is a
pretty sweet 3d platformer you plays a
glob in space and you have to grapple
the things to not die so that's your
objective you not die as your objective
i will show you one of the levels i
played it a little bit ago so as we see
here by our trusty stick guy who i cant
gravel to consequently you have to
grapple from one platform to another in
this level so this is of course a
tutorial level or at least just one of
the very early one so it is a bit easier
not that that's going to matter with me
cuz i have a spectacular ability to die
but as you see here you just grew apple
from one to the other you can grab those
green things if you can do it without
dying and these little white things are
checkpoints so if i fall down oh i
didn't actually notice that planet
before that's pretty cool I fall down I
will respawn at the white thing yep and
now as long i'm not okay good i am going
forward i missed the green thing that's
okay this is your objective to get into
the what I assume is a wormhole this is
still very early in the game right now
so of course it is going to be a bit
easier because they don't want to scare
people away because everyone's a noob so
this is actually pretty sweet as well
you can see it is a wall to wall jumping
sort of in classic Mario style I'm going
to try to get this yep there we go got
the green thing and don't do that
do that okay I couldn't reach I over
predicted my reach on that one so let's
try that again and I'll of the the
physics feels correct when you're
swinging if that makes sense it's it's
pretty easy to predict is what I'm
trying to say which day good thing
because you want to be able to predict
that element that mechanic of the game
oh that was pretty easy now this game is
not unless they made it available with
this build the game is not available in
full yet and it is on Steam greenlight
so go vote for it i will provide a link
in the in the description if i can speak
properly today I'll provided a link in
the description to vote for it on green
light so if I hate a new planet I was as
actually just going on an exploratory
mission there the link will be full o to
vote for it if you like it I'm gonna try
to swing in a circle and grab onto
something what do I want to go out to
you preferably a platform but there we
go I'm never gonna get up there yet am i
oh so close so close BAM skills ah no no
hello Tuesday society is doing a good
job with this game actually it's a it's
just a lot of fun and I've always
enjoyed these bulb light bulb based wow
I am having a really hard time with
words ball based platformer although
this one is a bit more gooey than your
traditional baldies platformer and a
spectral ball is actually one of my
favorite involved platformers of all
time but that was mostly because the
music although it did have some really
cool shortcuts in the game like
that you felt pretty awesome for finding
when you did find them because you could
suddenly come up on top of the
leaderboards and no one knew how you
beat the level in three seconds when
they did it in 30 and it was because of
secrets this game I have not found any
secrets like that yet but again full
development and all that that was close
I do feel like the mechanics will make
for some really cool time trial based
runs though so we will see how that
progresses whoa oh that was cool oh look
at that i'm fancy over here see if we
can make this jump i remember having a
lot of fun with this one actually there
we go you got to grab it and swing under
it and then grab the bottom of it which
I clearly did entirely intentionally
that was not and it's also intentional
so we were jumping to the frequency
board as I've named it and then up here
and grab grab like to workout program
and grab and grab and drop I'm never
gonna make it up there because again I
don't think there's a way to ascend the
grapple and there's no I don't have
controls here so we're just gonna drop
goodbye world or hello world I suppose
print hello world all right no grub grub
BAM into the wormhole okay so we have a
wall moving up in level I think this is
yes I have not completed this level yet
because I kept dying okay so we're gonna
have to drop keep that in mind keep that
in mind youtube so you can tell me what
I'm not sure what the heck to do ah oh
oh alright we have to run up the wall
that's right I've already forgotten what
the what the goal is onto the wall we're
gonna run under it yup there we go and
there's some red stuff and on to the
next one checkpoint let's drop jump
starting to starting to come together
now now that I'm understanding the flow
of the game a little better there's a
red one there so let's jump over and
jump up
gotta say it's uh for being in such an
early state that it is the mechanics do
feel pretty satisfying when you're
playing it's all very predictable which
again is a good thing oops see like that
I could have predicted that if I wanted
to but I wanted to see if you guys have
gotten it yet okay now what no now what
I want to get over there how do I do
that do I want to get over there is that
worries i do want to get over there well
this is a thing I'm pretty much stuck
here yeah I'm not gonna get any higher
that's for sure see what happens well I
got the green thing makes it all worth
it do I want to go down there I think I
want to hit between these well that was
cool i love it when when you feel smart
for figuring stuff out Lee games I think
that's probably the best player reward
there is like not just obviously in RPGs
or something you feel kind of ripped off
if you don't get items you're like oh
yeah great now I can't do anything but
in games like this and platformers or
puzzle games especially I think the best
reward is making the player feel like
they
have some someone's of intelligence or
figuring stuff out right except i'm
gonna eat my words right now because
because i'm pretty sure i'm in fact the
opposite of intelligent i think i just
jumped down to an old checkpoint but i'm
not sure let's see what uh I pretty sure
had jumped out to an old Jack wine so I
take everything i just said back uh-huh
although it was a good point i was
making it just doesn't apply here so i
guess i will continue at the point when
it is applicable one of the best rewards
is making the player feel smart for
solving the challenge because then it's
just it's incentive to keep playing and
to keep solving those challenges I
however am an idiot because I jumped to
an old checkpoint so don't take my word
for it I guess is what I'm saying I
think I might like I might have to jump
on that and then crawl no that's gonna
go to the old checkpoint again isn't it
hey I don't want to go down there
BAM oh that was awesome that was cool
true grappling as as you would think is
expected so we got some true grappling
there oh oh so close so close so I'm
gonna jump and then grab it at like the
up last second what Why Why What BAM did
it again Oh shouldn't should not have
jumped while upside down this is a
pretty sweet level actually oh that was
way fast holy crap grab I'm gonna fall a
little bit the grab and then swing into
this oh did she oh I'm supposed to fall
okay no wait okay there we go sort of
like a last one is sort of like just
cause grabbing it and grappling into the
ground because that makes sense and just
cause we're you're not going to take
damage if you grapple into the ground
where do I have to go
my copy on Spence that's that's uh oh oh
that I bet I have to grab that sweet ah
not feeling so sure about this jump oh
man that was close BAM pretty sweet game
I must say I am looking forward to the
full release that's for sure or even uh
I'm guessing if this isn't a beta I'm
guessing they'll do some kind of beta
build which I will definitely be playing
on YouTube again so look forward to
those I think oh gosh Oh Dane skills
right there oh-ho that was sweet I could
this is gonna be sweet for speedrunning
I can see that level being awesome on
speed runs okay I'm doing what the guy
is saying to do Seether make he's either
mocking me yeah he's mocking me look at
all that red stuff he is mocking me like
crazy right now
do I have to grab these or is that a bad
idea might be a bad idea despite this
you know this has better mechanics than
any of the spiderman games I've ever
played I don't know if that's good or
not i think that's that's not good for
spider-man I can tell you that much
pretty sure it's okay for this game
though well that was cool Oh noticing a
trend here where whenever I compliment
the game I die so maybe some
disincentive there well that was I was
about to say that was cool again but
we're not gonna do that because I'm
gonna die if I do okay okay got it just
remain calm remember bird is the word
and wormhole
think there were like 20 levels or
something right now I'm not sure oh yes
i agree with that guy what the heck am I
looking at here do I go under I got to
go under oh man under it is and I have
to swing around it now look so bad oh
man way better Oh see I was about to
count on it again I said way better you
don't know what I was gonna say was way
better than he has heard of spider-man
but I died as soon as I complement of
the game typical for me Harvard the
course oh I know I'm doing this part
right I don't know if I'm doing the next
part right i would say comment below but
by then I will have died another hundred
times sweet oh this looks challenging
I wonder if I can like swing under it
that would be pretty cool but I think
it's totally unnecessary it would be
cool to swing around the edge like that
I love you see what I'm saying oh man
made it hey I found a green thing sweet
hahaha as an awesome graphic and so good
at conveying what it's saying okay again
not even though just just know I'm going
to try to finish up this level and we
are going to wrap this video up I may do
more videos in the future I would
definitely do more videos in the future
of this game it's just a matter of when
I will do them and if I wait for another
release or not but keep your eyes open
on the bit on the channel of course for
more videos please like comment and
subscribe as always if you comment
please tell me which of my failures you
think was the most spectacular so I can
be sure to try to replicate it in the
feature for you because that is all
you're really here for is to see how it
miserably I hail man that would have
been 12 I survived alright one last go
and then we'll wrap it up BAM that well
that's as good Alaska as any I suppose
so I will sign off for now thanks for
watching and let me know what games
you'd like to see me play next I will be
playing ravaged on Tuesday and uploading
probably tuesday night i will be playing
what's that other i will be 0 dungeon
dashers yes I can't wait to play dungeon
dashers he just sent me a new build of
his game so that'll be pretty sweet keep
your eyes open and I will see you guys
next time peace ah how did I make it
through that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
