our bench for thermals and noise testing
with the conclusion being let it served
as a competitive option when matched
against the NZXT X 62 and coarser H 150
and I the CLC to 80 and 120 both try to
land between their major competitors
offering comparable cool and a noise
performance the NZXT that rivals crack
in mind but with simplified lighting
effects to help reduce cost today we're
reviewing the CLC 120 from EVGA s new
series we've already posted a tear down
of the cooler if you're curious about
more but before getting to that this
covered is brought to you by catalyst
energy mint so 3-pack of catalyst
contains the equivalent energy to over
21 energy drinks and at just 20 dollars
it works out to be a much more
affordable and portable option use code
gamers Nexus in the link below for 5%
off the EVGA CLC 120 is pretty
straightforward this is it versus the
280 it's all the same others on the side
so basically if you saw our 280 review
the CLC 280
the feature set in terms of the RGB LEDs
the pump plate the inside of it the a
subject gen 5 pump all of that is
identical the difference is that this
radiator on this one is 120 millimeters
and the other one is 280 and of course
the fans are different as a result this
is a 120 millimeter fan its range maxes
out at about 2500 rpm whereas the 140
millimeter fan maxed out somewhere
around 2200 rpm give or take the usual
percentage for manufacturing variance
and tolerance so we're really just
looking at a smaller version of it and
that means that we're in the 120 140
millimeter range for looking at
competition NZXT is kraken x 42 is a 140
millimeter competitor to this that is
actually quite expensive it's about $40
more so the EVGA CLC 120 is probably set
$90 the X 42 which is 140 millimeter
cooler with way more RGB functionality
is priced at 130 dollars and then
Corsair has some flanking options
there's plenty of air coolers as well
that compete with these smaller
radiators so keep that in mind but for
today we're primarily focusing on the
120 and how it compares against it's a
larger alternatives rather than looking
at the air coolers that'll come in a
future video so 120 versus the 242 8
140s all of those will be the main
content for today testing methodology as
always is a link in the description
below and the full article and written
review of this we've also already torn
the sound as stated and you can find
some photos of that there for the
testing the very basics you can find the
test system and its specs in that
article but we're still doing the same
ii ii ambient login using thermocouple
readers and then averaging out six cores
of temperature data over about a
thousand cells get the average numbers
we have over time numbers we do Delta
values for most of the computations and
that's pretty much the basics of it and
you can find the rest again in the
article as was last time let's first
start with just the EVGA CLC coolers
that be the one twenty and two 80s for
temperature readouts and then we'll add
the others we're seeing the EVGA 280 C
LC at ten fifty rpm outperform the EVGA
120 c LC at is maximum fan rpm of twenty
five hundred and that's about a one
point two Celsius difference between
them keep in mind that our variance is
about 0.5 C so we're outside of the
margin of test variance dropping down to
a more reasonable fan speeds the EVGA
120 c LC at 1500 rpm post the load
temperature of 59 to Celsius delta T now
about 10 Â°c warmer than the 39.5 C
delta T to 80 millimeter temperatures
when at ten fifty rpm fan speed finally
the 1050 RPM EVGA 120 unit operates with
an idle temperature of 11.4 C delta T
and a load about 57 or somewhere nearing
80 Celsius if we were to add ambient
back in pretty damn warm at that point
if you're curious we also tested the
cowling depth with the two eighty
millimeter cooler to see if the fan
casing made any real difference and the
short answer is no it didn't but you can
find that in our two eighty millimeter
written review which will throw down
below as well and just like last time
let's now add NZXT back into the results
and the XPS closes competition in terms
of size of the X 42 but the price is so
much higher that they're not really
head-to-head in terms of target market
the X 42 at ten fifty rpm outperforms
EVGA CLC 120 at 1500 rpm by four Celsius
give or take showing a clear advantage
in
the performance from the extra radiator
size and of course different and larger
fan design the x52 uses the same 120
millimeter sized fans but has two of
them on it's 240 millimeter radiator so
that matters we're able to run the x52
at 800 RPM and achieve a slightly better
performance a noise profile than EVGA
SPLC 120 at 10:50 rpm but again you're
dealing with a major price hike to the X
52 here's the chart with everything
added in the EVGA CLC 280 is still at
the top and is still exceptionally loud
it's not until way down the list that we
get to the smaller 120 millimeter
radiator which makes its first
appearance right around these 1700 rpm X
42 and the XT cooler where the EVGA 120
CLC operates at about $40 7/8 Celsius at
delta T the more reasonable 1500 rpm up
version of our test places the EVGA 120
CLC at 59 to Celsius delta T only
marginally better than the one air
cooler presently on our bench we'll have
to add more of those soon but again
future content piece for that finally
looking to the noise table we see the
EVGA CLC 120 landing between the X 42
and h100 iv2 both at 10:50 rpm when the
EVGA PLC is running as the same fan
speed this makes sense since the H 100 I
has similar 120 milliliters and strictly
from a noise perspective the performance
the volume is better with the larger
radiators and by volume I mean noise of
not size but your cost also increases
substantially moving to the EVGA CLC 120
at 1500 rpm this is also words most
likely to be used we're resting right at
around 40.7 DBA comparable to the dark
rock 3 at 2,000 rpm and ek predator 280
at 1,400 rpm the 2500 rpm EVGA CLC 120
is unbearably loud with its 53.9 DBA
output just like its neighboring 50 +
DBA coolers like again the EVGA 280 at
2200 rpm EVGA CLC 280 makes a lot of
sense in terms of the price and
performance positioning of that cooler
which is again cheaper than MDF these
options it's about $130 and a bit more
than Corsair is competing option but has
some more led functionality but
the CLC 120 is a much tougher sell and
it's for a few reasons one of them it's
$90 and it's performing really not that
great it's about where a good air cooler
would be and those will generally be
cheaper depends on what you're picking
up but the price compared to 140
millimeter options from Corsair and mdft
coolers although pretty competitive and
cheaper in some ways especially versus
mdft it's just not a great position
you'd be better off taking up either a
good one forty cooler or maybe something
that make more sense if you could fit it
would be a 240 millimeter cooler because
if we look to the coarser h100 I v2
which has been a strong competitors
throughout the last year or so even
against the kraken line and cheaper by
the way the coarser h100 i v2 is priced
at around $100 it's $10 more than this
and it performs better and it's got a
better price better noise performance
profile all that stuff for 10 bucks more
so if you can fit the 240 that would be
the way I would go rather than one of
these and a 120 variants unless you
really like the look of that pump plate
and you also can't afford or can't fit
the two 80 millimeter alternative of
this that EVGA makes so they put
themselves in an interesting position
you really should either go with a 140
millimeter or larger cooler with the
better performance noise profile or you
go with an air cooler if it can fit in
the case which so many exceptions can be
small form-factor
and if the looks are what you want so
that's really all this one comes down to
not nearly as exciting as the EVGA CLC
280 performance isn't fantastic but it's
still overall a pretty good entrance to
a new market for EVGA the 280 is
absolutely the one that they should push
up their flagship and just kind of push
that one off into a corner somewhere
because the 280 makes them look damn
confident it's their first venture into
a iOS and it's very competitive with the
X 52 the X 62 and the Corsair H 100 IV 2
and H sorry H 115 IV 2 as well
competitive with all of those and it's
price competitive so let's just forget
about this one if you are interested in
