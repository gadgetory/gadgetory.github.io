probably final part of our Radeon 7 the
quad cooling mod and we did a bit more
than just the liquid cooling so first of
all you may have noticed a few things
changed we get to that and secondly we
install the power plate tables mod so
we're able to overdo the power by a
couple hundred watts beyond what it was
doing stock so today we're going through
the results of that thermal power gaming
and anything else related to those
mostly overclocking in general before
that this video is brought to you by the
power color red dragon rx 588 gigabyte
card the RX 580 red dragon is a good fit
for 1080p and 1440p gaming priced very
competitively at $170 and including two
free games from AMD like the division 2
or Resident Evil 2
the red dragon series got a big name on
our channel when we pushed the Vega 56
red dragon to the limits but it's now
available at lower prices with the RX
588 gigabyte and rx 574 gigabyte the
latter of which is presently $130 while
the promo lasts learn more at the links
below before getting to the first round
of charts then the the main change was
all of it so the liquid cooler has been
replaced originally it was an alpha cool
GPX kit of some kind
and unfortunately that kit improved the
the GPU edge temperatures by a lot but
the GPU Junction temperatures were worse
they were throttling pretty much
constantly and so the reason for that is
because the edge temperature is
literally the edge of the die and the
contact there was good so no issues
there the junction temperatures it's the
hottest of the 64 sensors and somewhere
in the middle there wasn't good contact
and it was bad enough that even paste
wasn't filling the gaps and so we took
the cooler off looked at the cold plate
a bit closer and if you run your hand
across it you see that there are
actually some very noticeable bumps in
the finish of the cold plate on that
particular cooler so unfortunately
because of the imperfections on the
surface on that cold plate it just was
not usable maybe a like a Hitachi HMO 3
thermal pad might have worked but then
you're kind of defeating half of the
purpose of the mod so replaced it with
just an ace attack see I'll see you
might remember a clip from our Vega
frontier edition mod where we had my
neighbor drill some holes through the AC
tech mounting bracket and we dug that
back out stuck it on the thermaltake
flow 360 closed-loop liquid cooler to
Gen 4.5 pumps so it has a faster rpm
which is useful here through three
random fans on it that were lying around
and we ended up with this so it works
and the temperatures are actually quite
good so there's a lot to go over here
we're gonna go through thermals
frequency and the difference in
frequency stock for stock with the
original cooler be talking about power
consumption overclocking at the end I'm
going to go through some of the very
important peculiar behaviors with wot
man still so the absolute biggest thing
before we get into the charts that you
need to know is that the number you type
in for frequency with Radeon settings is
not the number you get out at least not
with this card and so if you type in
2030 megahertz and it says it's running
you need to check the actual frequency
because it's potty running more like
1952 maybe 2000 is what 2030 means and
then separately everything must be
validated with performance because as an
example we were able to get the card up
to let's call it 20 to 50 megahertz and
big air quotes there because you can
type in 20 to 50 in watt man and
provided you have the other settings
presumably in a buggy enough state where
it'll accept the number the the tool
will tell you that it's accepted 20 to
50 or whatever but in reality once you
run the performance numbers you'll see
that performance I actually decays this
is a bug that was in Radian settings
when Vega first came out so you line up
with the score of 1,800 instead of 5,000
or whatever and so the most important
thing is score must be used to validate
the overclocking success you can't just
go based on input in a number then does
it crash or not there needs to be a
score there which makes it take a lot
longer but let's get through the numbers
and then I'll talk you through some of
the rest at the end of the video at
quick sidenote here we might do some
extra testing on this we really want to
but we're going on a trip to Taiwan and
then China and we'll be there for a
while so if we do a part
three no guarantees it won't be till we
get back so anyway let's get into it
we'll get to the gaming benchmarks
posthaste but power consumption is too
fun to put off any longer
let's start with plotting total system
power consumption of the Radeon seven
stock card unmodified in any way for our
ashes of the singularity 4k benchmark
total system power consumption of the
stock card is at about 420 to 430 watts
peak with the average closer to 390 to
400 remember that's total system power
consumption but we do control the system
carefully to ensure only the GPU causes
power fluctuations next is to plot the
water cooling mod but still with stock
settings this line would potentially
reveal any power drop from reducing
power leakage something we've seen in
previous liquid cooling mods where every
10 degree Celsius drop will occasionally
get you about a 4% reduction power
consumption in this instance
unfortunately there's no meaningful
change in power consumption but there's
a reason for that and we'll talk about
that after the game benchmarks we don't
get the drop we sometimes see from power
leakage reduction our next line plot is
the overclocks water cooled card which
doesn't use any power play table mods
yet and only overclocks using the normal
watt Mann procedure our settings were
technically set to 2030 megahertz core
and twelve hundred megahertz memory but
the actual operating frequency is much
lower than this due to miss reporting or
inaccuracies in watt man realistically
we're more in the range of highly
variable 19 50 megahertz the 2009 Hertz
depending the result of this
configuration is a total system power
consumption though peaking at 520 watts
and averaging about 455 to 460 watts the
last line is the most impressive for
this one we're running a 100 percent
power target offset and pushing the card
draw towards the 500 watt marker total
system power consumption maxes out at
about 620 watts
an increase of around 200 watts over the
stock Radeon 70s that we first plotted
performance doesn't scale linearly with
this naturally but that doesn't matter
for what we're doing today we're just
trying to figure out how far we can
reasonably get Radeon 7 and it starts
with this 620 watt peak total system
power consumption for performance
benchmarks we'll start with x by extreme
just because it's a synthetic workload
that heavily loads the GPU and memory
independently so we get a fuller
understanding of the maximum theoretical
performance differences these
differences don't necessarily scale the
actual
gameplay but they're typically good
indicators just of whether the overclock
is even working
remember with Vega the biggest challenge
is that wot man might look like it's
accepting frequency over clocks but the
actual stability is worse and
performance will be worse as a result so
you can't trust the number that you set
the frequency to you have to validate
with performance otherwise it doesn't
count with time spy extreme we placed a
baseline score of 40 to 78 points under
complete auto with a full stock cooler
for the coolant solution our
overclocking test with the first driver
revision also failed often causing
performance regressions even with small
overclock so you can see in some of the
results that we have here we placed at
about 1,800 points to 1900 which is a
massive regression in performance this
issue has been pretty much resolved with
the newest driver which is why
revisiting today there's still
performance regressions with unstable
overclocked settings and there's no way
to validate that other than performance
testing for the first overclocked
attempt with the new drivers we scored
45 62 points by operating with a 200
megahertz offset on our liquid cooled
mod again 200 Hertz offset doesn't mean
it's just straight 200 or it's higher
because it's variable using that a 120
percent power target 1.125 GPU voltage
we ended up at that 45 62 score with the
clock set to 20 megahertz offset and a
one-point 162 volt GPU core voltage
still using a 1,000 megahertz stock
memory frequency and 120 power target
120 percent we scored 46 17 points this
is an increase over stock of about 8%
which gives you an idea for the upper
limits of our liquid cooled Radeon 7
before using any other mods like Power
Plate able registry mods to increase the
power target beyond stock the final
result was 48 97 points sparing everyone
the slow increases in between where we
set the frequency to a 250 mega Hertz
offset voltage to 1.2 37 volts which is
over the stock spec and uses power plate
table mods and the power target was set
to 100 percent or technically 99 percent
offset for a total system power of well
two hundred percent if you added up that
way the memory was twelve hundred
megahertz this result is at fifteen
percent over the stock performance
number moving to another times by
extreme chart next we can look at the
individualized GT wanted you to do
scores presented as FPS which helps us
better visualize these specific areas of
performance uplift gt2 traditionally
gets the
just gains from memory overclocking
whereas GT Wan gains the most from core
over clocks as it better supports the
specific workloads the final overclock
allowed for GT scores of 25.8 5 for gt2
and 35 point three eight for GT one
better than FPS and showing individual
gains of 13.5 percent over the stock 31
point one eight FPS for GT one and
fifteen point two percent improvement
over the stock GT to score from the
original Radeon seven tests although the
Delta isn't massive between GT one and
two it is common that we see and these
gt2 performance drag more of the weight
upward as memory frequencies increase
and he needs that memory bandwidth on a
tire and GPUs and it does benefit from
memory overclocking sometimes it more
than from core overclocking depending on
the application on the workload before
plotting thermals and talking about our
overclock stepping and challenges in
overclocking it'd be good to get some
gaming results presented for those most
curious about performance gains and
linearity of the overclock first up is
apex Legends which is already
demonstrated in an uncounted performance
advantage to the Radeon seven rich the
RDX 20/80 competitor we're starting here
because it's sort of a best-case
scenario for a DM 7 so keep in mind that
these results won't extrapolate to all
their games equally at 4k with all
settings configured a high using our
river village benchmark the Radeon seven
card placed at 56 FPS average with lows
at 43 and 44 fps performance was overall
good functionally tie in with the gtx
980ti
there was no meaningful difference
between the 1080i and Radeon 7 cards so
our TX 2080 tree i/o stretched its
compute targeted legs with a 65 FPS
average leading the stock Radeon 7 by
about 16% with the base overclocked and
a water cooling mod noting again that
the 2030 megahertz in quotes there is
just the setting not the actual output
frequency we see a frame rate of 62 FPS
average that's not polluted 10.5% over
the stock Radeon 7 performance and
encroaches on stock RDS 2080 territory
granted you could overclock the 2080 as
well and power would be lower but this
is closing in and an impressive way at
least on the stock card 3d on 7 power
play tables mod puts it at 65 FPS
average giving us a disappointing
improvement over the overclocked
average performance of 4.2% in plain
terms and more straightforward and non
stat mathy terms it's 2 to 3 FPS which
is an invisible improvement in other
words so the percentage sounds a bit
better than the reality it's an
improvement on the last the end result
is that we tie with the RT x 2080 trio
which isn't a bad result just not as big
of an improvement as you'd expect given
a power increase
let's show a frame time performance plot
to better illustrate the frames of frame
interval differences in this test the
lower frame times are better but
consistence is better than lower testing
is repeated in the same area and test
variance is under one FPS average per
run so this is very consistent and
accurate as a test pattern 3d im7 stock
card ends up averaging closer to 19 to
20 milliseconds per frame with frame to
frame an interval deviation never
greater than two milliseconds on average
plus or minus this is excellent
consistency despite slower than 60 FPS
average frame rates and the power mod in
liquid cooling get our frame times down
to 14 to 17 milliseconds on average
depending frames of frame interval
variance does not meaningfully widen so
our overclock is considered stable for
this testing at 1440p for Apex legends
the gradient 7 stock card ran a baseline
frame rate of 106 FPS average which was
significantly outdone by the overclocked
variants 120 FPS average just like last
time we see about a 13% increase in
performance over baseline with the
water-cooled overclocked tests and also
like last time we see very little
difference with a power-play mod
actually it's worse this time
unfortunately with this test the
difference was within test variants it's
really no different at all
there was zero benefit from increased
power consumption to the core we believe
this to be a limitation of the core
frequency as opposed to the 4k results
where more of the memory bandwidth is
utilized so the differences don't come
out as strongly with a more core limited
scenario at least that's our hypothesis
for this one time spy extremes earlier
GT 2 results reinforced this belief the
end result is that the Radeon 7 / clock
ends up leading the r-tx 2080 by about
14% and is nearly tie in the RT x 28 ETI
again you cannot extrapolate this across
all games but it's still good
information for this game unfortunately
some people will see this and tell
everyone that Radeon 7 is almost as good
as a stock 28 ETI but that's not always
true
that said let's try another best-case
scenario let's look at Sniper Elite 4
and see how close the Radeon 7 can get
to the 2080 Ti and that one although we
do need to keep everyone's expectations
in check by looking at some DX 11 games
after that so I'm currently at 4 with
high settings and DX 12 gave us stock
Radeon 7 performance of about 85 FPS
average with low as well spaced behind
this positions Radeon seven is about
tied with the RDX 20 ATF II and just
behind the gtx 980ti overclocking and
water cooling gave a significant uplift
to 97 FPS average or 14 4.4 percent
increase in performance allowing the
radium 7 to outpace the stock 1080i and
20 ATF II though overclocked results
obviously reshuffle things a bit again
the power mod only gives us another
couple percent increase in performance
disappointingly so the real story is in
the uplift from cooling and a more basic
overclock either way the power mod does
start to approach 20 atti stock
performance but doesn't quite make it
there and is still led by the stock 28
ET i by 9 percent we've looked at more
compute intensive games the apex
although using dx11 and sniper is in the
x12
so now it's time to balance with a more
traditionally devolved game GTA 5 at 4k
and very high ultra settings produces
the Radeon sevens FPS at 51 FPS average
with lows at 41 and 39 FPS this ranked
it as just ahead of the RT X 2070 only
about 7% while still being $200 more
expensive than our tested 2070 the
water-cooling mod and overclocked
improves the Radeon 7 performance 256
FPS average an increase of about 9% and
allowing it to get closer to the 61 FPS
average of these stock RT X 2080 on our
charts overclocked in the 2080 didn't
get it much in this game and it only
created a few percent gap versus the
stock 2080 the powerplay tables mod
allowed the Radeon seven card to get 257
FPS average showing an improvement
consistent with the previous results of
about two to three percent uplift then
that change is 11% versus the stock
Radeon 7 with performance just under the
stock RT X 28 EF II when the 7 is pushed
to our power flameout limits it's a very
far distance from the 28 ET I stock card
which leads the Radeon 7 power play mod
by 55% that's a pretty hard counter to
our previous two charts and gives us
another perspective of how a game might
perform at 1440p GTA 5 shows the stock
Radeon 7 at 99 FPS average leading the
1080 FTW by about 6.6 percent the
overclocked and water-cooled Radeon 7
places at 107 point 6 FPS average
improving over stock performance by 9
percent again with a power-play mod then
showing some similarly poor gains as
seen in the apex legend 1440p benchmark
we think that most of the performance
gains may be once again more resultant
of the memory increase than the flimsy
and unpredictable core increases for f1
2018 at 4k the Radeon seven card
performs at 73 FPS average when stocked
which is the 20 eighties 81 FPS average
although we previously Illustrated that
the Radeon 7 does post stronger frames
I'm performance in this particular title
overclocking and water cooling the
Radeon 7 gets it up to 70 9.6 FPS
average posting an increase of 9% once
again with a very plain mod putting it
284 FPS average and improving at an
additional 5 percent over the previous
overclock this is one of the bigger
jumps we've seen from just the power
play tables the net gain versus stock is
14.5% Landing it close to an overclocked
1080i but not quite passing at an
average frame rate although the low
frame time performance is superior as we
discussed in our previous review far cry
5 is the last one at 4k the Radeon 7
stock card ran at 60fps average with the
water-cooled overclocked at 67 point 5
FPS average which is functionally tied
with a 20 ATT I tested back on for 17.3
5 we've not looked at far cry again on
the 28 TI since 417 YT 5 but so far the
two are about equal with the overclock
and water cooling on the Radeon 7 card
adding the power mod only gives us a
couple of percentage points of
improvement hitting 69 FPS average and
improving 15% over baseline stock and
adding water and an overclock to the 28
ET I gives it 282 FPS average
leading the more power-hungry Radeon 7
by 18.6%
and this is without any BIOS flashes so
it can't go to higher power targets like
the Radeon 7 is doing in our original
baseline testing ignoring vrm thermals
for a moment we placed the Radeon 7 and
its Itachi graphite thermal pad at a
junction temperature of 108 degrees
Celsius under load as a reminder
Junction temperature is the hottest of
the 64 thermal sensors across the
package
whereas GPU temperature is the edge
temperature literally the temperature at
a cooler edge of the GPU die it is
therefore less useful but it's the more
traditional measurement that you're used
to seeing the junction temperature has a
t.j.maxx of 110 degrees when stock so
108 is technically under t.j.maxx GPU
edge temperature was about
80 degrees when tested stock and the
clocks will boost based on the junction
temperature so that's the really the
more relevant one here our water-cooled
mod under the same stock clock and
voltage conditions ran a junction
temperature approximately 39 degrees
cooler than the stock temperatures at
about 68 to 70 degrees Celsius Junction
the GPU edge temperature also ended up
about 40 degrees below a stock as you
would expect and that ended up at a firm
40 degrees Celsius
note that the ambient temperature was
controlled at 22 degrees Celsius for
both tests and was logged every second
of the test of the thermocouple reader
we are not doing a delta T over ambient
here so this is just the straight
temperature readout and our Delta would
be well subtract 22 or so and that's
your Delta moving on to the frequency
overtime test for the same test case we
see that critically performance is
actually up versus the stock air cooled
card and this is without any overclock
settings applied that means that
boosting is utilizing the extra thermal
Headroom which may also explain why we
didn't see reduce power consumption from
leakage earlier if it's boosting clocks
and voltages meet the thermal headroom
until a hitting a power target power
consumption would remain the same our
average frequency for the water-cooled
mod is about 1720 to 1750 megahertz
with some spikes although rare up to
1800 megahertz the stock card averages
closer to 16 50 megahertz allowing us a
70 megahertz to 100 megahertz average
increase just from liquid cooling the
card there are no changes in watt man or
any other overclocking software and
there are no mods beyond the water cool
that's a very good result and is
essentially a pre overclock achieved
just by using a better cooling solution
which illustrates that the boost
parameters on this card are functioning
as they should it is sort of comparable
to the NVIDIA GPU boost routine where
it'll boost based on thermals voltage
things like that still the water mod is
more variable and frequency likely due
to the power limits but it a verge is a
higher result and is overall better
finally the newest gpu-z rendition has
given us softer monitoring of the
sensors inside of the power components
Rhian Radeon 7 bill joins video on our
channel talks about these parts in more
depth but we can show the thermals of
our mod here in a more practical fashion
just to prove that you don't need a base
plate on the vrm and
be validated this with hardware k-type
thermocouple as well the hottest
component was a GPU vrm MOSFET which
plotted at about 50 degrees Celsius
that's not over ambient or anything
that's just straight 50 C in a 22 °c
ambient environment so our Delta is
about 30 degrees that's damn good
particularly considering we have no base
plate no direct contact cooling and we
only positioned a knock to a fan to blow
over the VR at air is enough here we can
even run this passively without the
knock to a fan although that wouldn't be
advisable once you actually start
overclocking with power mods you
probably want the cooling that either
way Radeon 7vr M is efficient enough
that it doesn't run too hot the GPU
memory temperature plotted at about 47
to 48 degrees Celsius will just
complicate the chart now and throw the
rest of the measurements up there all at
once the memory vrm and SRC v RM
temperatures ended up in the range of 35
to 44 degrees Celsius ensuring that this
card ran well within spec and better
than stock even without the direct
contact heatsink on the VXR so closing
out then as we prepare to get on the
plane to go to taiwan i would i keep
this a cut a few charts out that i did
want to include but i'll just present
the numbers verbally instead so the
junction temperature with the card using
its power mod and the liquid cooling
mods that's the one thermal chart we did
not show the junction temperature there
is about 99 degrees celsius it goes up
quite a bit but it's still not hitting
t.j.maxx which is 110 stock or 120
degrees by Andy's own configuration when
you start playing out with overclocking
setting so we were still 20 degrees off
of t.j.maxx which means we have a bit
more Headroom but we're starting to hit
some limits here where the power offset
just seems like it stops working at some
point so you keep increasing increasing
increasing and eventually you look at
the power draw it like a current clamp
look at a wall meter look at gpu-z and
they're all showing the same sort of
maximum power at like 470 to 500 watts I
think there's a way to get around this I
have seen successful users and forums
who are able to get beyond 500 watts of
power pushed into the GPU which is what
we'd like to do as well unfortunately
like it said leaving town so didn't dig
into it any further than that I will
leave that for later if you know of
someone who is successfully act
fully validated that their card is
accepting more than 500 watts please let
us know and with a link to maybe their
thread form thread below and I'll look
into it as soon as we're back and see if
we can get a little further because I
feel like there's still more in this
card but the scaling obviously falls off
a cliff even if there's more power we
can push into it once we got to well
once we did the power play mod the gains
start really dropping fast and there
might be I think there's more we can do
in memory too we stopped at 1200
megahertz
it kind of started artifacting in some
applications and stopping there but I
think in some gaming or benchmark
applications we might be able to push a
bit higher so that's something to
revisit now overall the power offsets a
bit buggy sometimes you do occasionally
have to DD you reinstall remodel Phi the
registry depending on we use the power
play table so if you have one power play
table modification installed and you try
to do another one sometimes it doesn't
take and you have to wipe everything and
do it again we did some basic under
voltage I have data on that we'll talk
about that later again it's gonna be a
while because we're gonna be in Asia but
we got it successfully to about like
point 9 something 0.94 maybe and then
below that it just wasn't really holding
and also quick note on under volting
doesn't count as under volt in if you
under volt it and then you increase the
power offset to achieve this is the same
power consumption with the same clocks
so there are something there's some
really important caveats to discuss
there we talked about someone with
builds right as well but we'll do that
later so is it worth it the answer is
well if you're buying radeon 7ne way it
might be worth trying to liquid cool it
whether that's with a proper block and
those are probably coming out or
something else but it might be worth it
because the performance uplift just from
liquid cooling it and doing a basic
overclock with the I should have
mentioned this earlier with AMD driver
version nineteen point two point three
it's it's the newest absolute newest
version I think it's called an optional
version as of today which is March 1st
so a 90 point two point three I think is
the newest one eyes of today so with
that driver version
overclocking does sort of work now which
is good actually it does work I mean if
you're if you're not playing around with
power play tables it pretty much just
works properly out of the box took
Jensen's quote there by accident but it
is it is more or less functional at this
point so you can overclock now good news
there and the kind of told us that you
it wasn't a software issue earlier and
they thought it was just the limit of
the card but the card actually can do
more so that's good news and can
overclock you do a water cooling mod you
get a pretty far up the charts first as
the stock configuration it's outpacing
our RT X xx 80s in some cases where it
wasn't before it's approaching RT X xx
ATT is in some cases that are really
compute heavy so specific application
workloads like compute intensive stuff
very bandwidth intensive stuff you can
see some pretty noteworthy gains with
the basic overclock by which I mean no
power mods even registry mods and a
liquid cooler and so we think that's
worth doing if you get one of these of
course you know you start exiting spec
so if that's not your thing then don't
do it I guess but for anyone who's into
modding we're just getting more out of a
kind of fun card to hack around with and
it's worth doing the power ploy tables
kind of work just be careful
once you start doing that stuff you can
push more power into it then as it's
meant for and you know if we ran it with
our power play mod for a year I have no
idea if the card would even still work
it's just that that's probably not
something we would recommend for daily
use so keep that in mind but anyway
nineteen point two point three is the
important bit and then power play mods
be careful with them is important as
well don't use them for 24/7 if you're
pushing not 500 watts into the GPU I
know it might be ok not an expert there
but it's just going past spec
significantly enough that we're
uncomfortable recommending it to anyone
who spends this much money on a card and
then intends to use it 24/7 as opposed
to just for fun for overclocking you can
of course step it down do like a 50% off
set you're probably fine but no
guarantees so that's it for this one
thank you for watching please leave any
any questions if you think we sort of
skipped over something because we're in
a rush to get the door please leave your
questions in the comment section below
and what we'll do is revisit the topic
as soon as we are back in the studio and
can do some additional testing it
a really fun project we liked working on
it a lot and I look forward to working
on it some more so big is always pretty
fun to overclock and play around with
and and there's more room yet for us to
do that so give us some time we'll do
more hope you like the content though
