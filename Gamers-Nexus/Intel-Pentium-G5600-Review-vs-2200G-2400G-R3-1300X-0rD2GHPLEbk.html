managed to hold on as one of the better
buys of the past few years there's a
brief period where the g3 two five eight
made a lot of sense for ultra budget
mind buyers and then the g 4560 recently
particularly at the actually good price
of $60 and now intel has its pentium @g
5000 series rebranded as pentium gold
the g forty five sixty had stunted
growth from limited stock and steep
hikes on MSRP forcing people to consider
i threes instead up until our threes
from AMD shipped the forty five sixty
remains a good buy as it dropped toward
$60 fully capable of gaming on the cheap
but is now being replaced by the units
we're reviewing this month before that
this video is brought to you by thermal
takes view thirty seven case the vo
thirty seven focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 we're starting with our
gaming benchmarks of the g 5600 this is
the most expensive of the intel pentium
gold series the gold doesn't really mean
anything it's basically the version of
the Pentium line that we would buy as
DIY PC builders but the G 5600 is what
we're looking at that's ninety five
dollars that makes it forty dollars more
than the modern-day price t forty five
sixty which is just under sixty bucks
and it's about ten dollars more than the
fifty five hundred twenty dollars more
than the 5400 and the are three thirteen
hundred X is roughly 10 ish dollars more
at one hundred five dollars on average
with the RO three twelve hundred at
ninety five dollars so it's a really
dense class to compete in and at one
point the intel pentium lines were
pretty much uncontested here other than
when the athlon x4 CP is shipped but
those have been few and far between now
there's a lot more competition for the g
5600 we're looking at a dual-core quad
thread cpu at 3.9 gigahertz no boost and
with four megabytes of l3 cache maximum
memory support is officially listed at
24
Hertz and using that an appropriate
motherboard would further limit that to
twenty four hundred megahertz the CPU is
make the most sense to pair with non
z-series motherboards as you really
won't gain any of the benefit from a z
series port the 5500 is mostly the same
thing except 100 megahertz lower the
5400 is 200 Hertz slower at 3.7
gigahertz with maximum graphics
frequency also slowed down by about 95
megahertz if you use the IGP
so then just outright d GPU coupled
performance and gaming the only major
difference between the Pentiums and
there are three CPUs and architectural e
is the existence of an integrated
graphics processor on the Intel Pentium
processors so if you're gonna use that
for some reason maybe you're not really
doing any gaming or at least not
anything serious or even you sports like
then I guess maybe that's something to
note but for our testing purposes we're
looking at these as products you would
pair with a cheap d GPU like a GT 1030
which we did in some tests and then
repair it with a 1080 Ti and others
obviously just to eliminate GP
bottlenecks because that's how you test
processor differences let's go the test
bench up on the screen we're focusing on
gaming benchmarks only today with a
couple of power benchmarks at the end
these aren't really CPU as you'd use
with blender or anything like that so
we're not even gonna bother looking at
those results the test bench is
sponsored by Corsair is using an ax 1600
eye power supply and a kit of 32 hundred
megahertz memory however we dropped that
memory down to 24 hundred megahertz for
purposes of testing the pentium line
cpus because that's the frequency you
would use with them sure you can put it
with a Z series board sure you could get
better memory support but why would you
do that so we're testing with it in the
configuration that we assume most users
would use the processor and we also have
data for I 3s and G 4560 thing like that
with the lower memory speeds as well
so this exits are standardized 30 200
megahertz memory testing with CPU
reviews but again it this is a scenario
where real world makes more sense to
focus on so let's get into the numbers
for this we're using H series
motherboards it rather than Z series and
more information as always will be in
the article link the description below
if you have questions about the
testing platform we're starting with
civilization 6 turn time benchmarks
first as it's a unique metric that
reflects specifically on CPU performance
we run a benchmark that has five turns
until our next turn and for the G 5600
each turn averages sixteen point three
seconds with a twenty four hundred
megahertz kit of memory that's among the
worst three numbers we've seen Zin
civilizations update which means that
you're looking at about one minute and
twenty seconds between each turn for
perspective the fastest performer the
overclocked 8700 K sees turn time drops
to about 51 seconds when multiplied by
five turns in other words to be very
simple about this with civilization six
if we click end to turn with the 5600 we
wait about a minute and a half for our
next turn with the stark contrast 8700 K
we wait just under a minute for the next
turn meaning our next play compared to
more reasonably to its predecessor
Pentium G 4560 with twenty four hundred
megahertz memory the 5600 operates at a
time reduction of 7.2% B 5600 also
operated at roughly equivalence with our
r3 1300 X stock CPU overclocking it
would place it ahead of the G 5600
naturally the i3 7300 operated just
slightly faster at fifteen point nine to
sixteen seconds and would be similar to
the 8300 that we haven't yet retested
GTA v isn't particularly friendly to the
Pentium CPUs although it's still plenty
playable we're clearly running into GPU
bottlenecking
at this point operating at 82 FPS
average with the 5600 versus a maximum
possible 152 FPS average with our GPU
bottlenecked 8700 K and 8600 K 5
gigahertz results so the 5600 is a
limiting our GPU here it is the
bottleneck the G 5600 still manages to
outperform the 45 60 by 17% a remarkable
uplift and is roughly matched with the
i3 7300 an average 1% and 0.1% lows the
r3 1300 X operates 8.5% faster in
average FPS with no meaningful
difference in frame time performance
that's about 1% per dollar extra spent
on the 1300 X
not about uplift if considering the
Rison alternative at 1440p it's about
the same results the only thing that
changes is the top-end performance
because we've been completely
bottlenecks on the CPU at the low-end
and remain bottlenecks at the high-end
by the GPU just because it's already
high on CPU the more intensive GPUs and
areas of 1440p just don't matter for
something like a G 5600 where we're
limited anyway to around 80 FPS average
assassin's creed origins is an intensive
game for these CPUs to sustain and is
our next one we finally get some values
dipping below 60 FPS average for the
Pentium CPU we're down to 55 FPS average
for the G 5600 outpacing the 45 60 by
11.7%
with these 7300 ahead by 3% the r3 1,300
x gains in a big way outperforming the
5600 by 16% an average FPS and our
performing it significantly in 1% low
frame time performance performance is
similar at 1440p as shown here we have
some differences that are within
variants but that's about it
let's move on to watch dogs to watch
dogs - at 1080p has us at 50 FPS average
with low as reasonably behind at 39 and
33 FPS 0.1% lows the G 5600 runs about
30% faster than the 45 60 is 44 FPS
average again a somewhat remarkable gain
since 7300 is at rough equivalence with
the 5600 and the r3 1300 X Paul's ahead
by 14% with its 56 FPS average lows
aren't improved in a meaningful way with
the rise in CPU but the average FPS
certainly improves significantly and
that's for about a 10 to 15 dollar price
bump not bad
as expected 1440p results post the same
values for the low-end nothing changes
in the chart here we'll just skip along
to the next chart ashes of the benchmark
is next and remains one of the most
thread intensive games put air quotes
around that word and this one we're
treating like a synthetic test the GV
600 at 1080p watch 21 FPS average
marking at a bit ahead of the 45 60 and
a bit behind the 7,300 the r3 1300 X
operated at 23.6 FPS average for a lead
of about 10% projects cars should favour
the Pentium CPUs a bit more than Ash's
did for this game G 5600 lands at 70
FPS average and plays reasonably well
it's doing fine
the 7300 outperforms it by about two
percent and the G 45 60s 69 FPS average
is outperformed by the 5600 by 13%
although not appreciable the G 5600 also
does better lows than the G 45 6d the
ARMA 3 1300 x manages 85 FPS average
with lows also advantaged but again not
particularly user appreciable the lead
is about 9 percent for the R 3 in this
one finally for low-end games we're
mostly comparing versus the likes of the
and the AP use when using a GT 1030 for
the Pentium processors this puts pricing
as similar to the RFI 2400 G or close
enough to be comparative with a GT 1030
the G 5600 plays rocket League at high
settings at 1080p with an average FPS of
64 we're becoming bound by the hardware
clearly because you can look at other
results and see higher performance the
result ties us with the G 45 60 roughly
the overclocked r3 1200 and the AP use
dota 2 shows similar CPU limitations the
G 5600 leads everyone else even though
overclock to r3 that's partly because
dota 2 shows drawn favor toward Intel
its frequency and IPC intensive finally
for some perspective it's only fair that
we look at power consumption numbers at
the EPS 12-volt rails and for Cinebench
multi-threaded the G 5600 is the lowest
power consumption device we've tested
lately for cpus anyway its operating at
about 26 watts on the hd7 motherboard
with the next lowest device at 40 watts
for the r3 1300 x stock CPU the 82 50k
stock CPU operated at 46 watt
single-threaded power consumption in
Cinebench is up against the limitations
of our test resolution at about 15 watts
for the g4 the 600 single-threaded
3dmark physics testing is our gaming
standin and shows a 21 watt consumption
at the EPS 12-volt rails that's
significantly lower than the 38 watt
1300 X and the 34 watt 8250 K given the
average a difference in game performance
it seems fair that the G 5600 operates
behind the 1300 X when we see these
power consumption metrics recapping all
that then at 40 dollars more than the G
45 60 it makes
that we're seeing the performance
differences we are the differences
between a 45 60 and a 5600 are
significant in some cases double-digit
percentages and that's a lot
so the $40 makes sense and in a vacuum
where we're just comparing previous into
all the current Intel it's not a bad
jump it is a big jump in price but the
performance gain is actually there it's
not a vacuum though Intel has other
products and Andy now has products that
are actually very competitive in this
space including AP use as we showed in
the low end gaming test where the AP is
do exceptionally well very well you end
up bottlenecked by other components in a
cheap d GPU system anyway so an AP you
might make more sense depend on what
you're trying to build the RO 320 200 G
all costs tallied is a really affordable
processor for gaming and can do some
graphics as well it's good enough for
all the eSports titles we test it's good
enough for csgo dota 2 rocket League
overwatch all those kinds of games at
reasonably high settings so if that's
the kind of game you're playing just by
the AR 322 energy don't worry about the
2400 G don't worry about a Pentium in a
cheap D GPU the 2200 G is exceptional
for what it does at its price it is
pretty cheap though so if you do have
the budget for something better we
encourage you to spend it because you
will get at this price class you get
significantly bigger gains for every
extra 10 or 20 dollars you spend it
scales that rapidly at the low end so if
you can afford more do it but consider
that the r3 1300 X or I guess the 1200
if you overclock it are very competitive
with the 5600 when you consider the
price what's really going to be the
question is how do the 50 450 500 per
forum which we also will be testing soon
because these are the ones where they're
ten or twenty dollars cheaper than the
5600 the 56 hundreds biggest weak spot
is being ten bucks away or even
equivalent from the are three serious
CPUs and those actually are very
competitive at gaming at the price point
it's no longer the case where Intel's
just flat out the best at gaming sure at
the high end
absolutely the 8700 K pretty much
uncontested
especially considering overclocking but
these CPUs
the frequencies low enough on them being
sub 4 gigahertz and pretty much all
cases here that yeah they run really
close to our 3s and our threes have
potentially advantages and some of the
performance metrics as we saw low double
digits for some of them high single
digit percentages for other games so our
3 is looking really compelling right now
and previously we like the G 45 60 so
much because at $60 which is what it
sold that today and what it always
should have been sold at but wasn't at
$60 the 45 60 is so far away from our
three CPUs and ApS that if you're trying
to build the cheapest possible thing a
45 60 with an appropriately non-mining
world price GT 10 30 yet say 70 bucks
which is what it should be would be a
crazy good build for an ultra budget
gaming PC but if you're looking higher
classes of price than that
and with the GPU market the way it is
the 5600 just looks kind of like it's an
unconvincing by it's hard to recommend
it so here's what we'll do for now if
you have a really strict budget still
consider a 45 60 with a cheap d GPU
that's still a good combo or consider
the are 320 200 G we have charts for all
of them go look at our 2200 G and 2400 G
gaming benchmarks to get details on the
performance there and make your decision
on which one you want if you're trying
to spend more than that we would say for
now pass on the 5600 unless you really
want that IGP which is valid and get an
r3 instead or wait for our 5400 5500
benchmarks and see if those offer better
value for the 10 or $20 - that you get
from the 5600 at which point you're
creating enough of a price gap between
the r threes that there might be a price
reason you would buy the lower end
Pentiums but the 5600 is just far too
close to price with the our threes and
we're seeing enough of an advantage with
the our threes and some of these games
that is we just don't recommend it right
now
so it's interesting it's very
interesting because Intel
for a while now much to their own
chagrin has had a really good product
for low-end Pentium the forty five sixty
three to five eight although limited in
its use cases for that one
they were good products for ultra budget
PC build but Intel sort of stunted the
growth of the forty five sixty by not
making enough of them prices were too
high and now they come out with a new
line and it's just not as impressive as
it used to be so far we still have seen
where to look at so that's it's sort of
disappointing but it does show that Andy
is making gains in the market for budget
CPUs for gain and that's a very good
thing to have that competition there so
