dotnet and we are here at pax east 2013
i am joined by nick Pinkerton and
patrick stone and we were just going to
do a quick video / cast talking about
the event today and i wanted to open up
with Rose will we met with Rose well
there's a video online already so check
the description below for the link to
that the computer you're looking at
right now uses a intel i7 3970 X so a
pretty expensive processor and x79 SR
motherboard I'm not sure which brand
right now three gtx 680 s in sli 60 64
gigabytes excuse me of Kingston's beast
memory because it is pretty beastly at
1600 watts of power from their hercules
power supply which was also custom
modded by BS mods so if you look at the
the power supply in the video you can
see that it was custom matched the whole
case actually has custom meshed and it
even has I believe seven or so 12,000
rpm industrial server fans so we were
advised to not stick our hands in them
and and with that i'm going to two lead
off to Patrick actually to talk a little
bit more about the hardware industry at
PAX East yeah it's really good to see a
good showing from the hardware vendors
pretty much all the big names were there
minus one important one AMD still
wondering why they're not showing up
here I'm sure there's a good reason
somewhere not an AMD hater just letting
you guys know but yeah it's you know
haven't haven't packs being a gaming
focused con it's certainly important
that the gaming industry's hardware
suppliers are there and once again like
in the past few years the hardware
industry showed up and true like natural
all out force and one of the things that
I thought was really kind of a sad thing
this year is that there's not a lot of
new stuff Intel calls it a talk in their
language is more of a refinement year at
this point in time it's more of a hey
there's hardware out there it's got the
capabilities
one of the developers going to do and so
one of the one of the tiles that came
out that Nick Pickard and got to look at
was daylight and I'll let him talk about
that a little bit right so as you might
have heard daylight is the first or one
of the first games to showcase the
Unreal Engine 4 and it's the first game
that has been playable for 10 days and
obviously it's a very impressive game
the the lighting when when you could
actually see during the game because it
it is a survival horror was very it's
all dynamic lighting so it's one of the
few games out there that has the
capability of doing that and I'm sure
that that's something that the Unreal
Engine 4 is you know capable of
delivering their the audio was actually
something that I thought was equally as
impressive this is from the studio that
developed the blacklight retribution
game and they've also had they have
people who've worked on fear and
condemned so they really know a lot
about about survival horror right there
Unreal Engine 4 just looks amazing when
you think about the longevity of unreal
3 and and you know where that started
even on console with games like Gears of
War I mean we are seeing that for that
full generation jump now with Yui for so
it's cool to have that first hands-on
experience even before you actually get
to the announcement of some of the the
upcoming consoles I also liked how the
game offers what we call a procedural
generation they're yeah they're yeah
obviously I was going to revert back to
my other term right so basically the
game isn't is not going to be the same
experience every time you play through
it so all the objects and the instances
that come up with in the game are
generated randomly so you can play this
game all the way through be scared and
whatnot but when you go but when you
load it back in to try it out again it's
going to be a different experience the
next time around so you can't just you
know sprint through it and expect
everything to happen just like the first
time so it's definitely something to
look forward to and it looked beautiful
obviously was run on a gtx 680 so they
wanted to show it off as best as they
could but i imagine that even with some
of the kind of like mid-range graphics
card
out there you can still have a
pretty-looking daylight that's called
and uh Unreal Engine 4 is also supposed
to be showcasing real-time ray tracing
at some point in the future from what
Nvidia told us previously real-time ray
tracing is ray tracing is just the
game's ability to realistically
interpret lighting effects on reflective
or metallic surfaces and other services
of that sort like transparent services
as well so real time ray tracing is the
ability to render all that in real time
without pre-rendered graphics that
without pre-baked lighting or anything
like that so if it does make an
appearance in Unreal Engine 4 as it did
in the trailer released a couple years
ago for the engine I think I think we'll
have a pretty big jump in gaming
graphics of course a lot of that will
hinge on the consoles and how they
interpret all that the only other thing
I wanted to cover was grid to really
quickly while we're on gaming I played a
little bit of grid 2 while i was there
unfortunately I couldn't get many
questions answered because the reps were
we're pretty busy with other goings on
in the booth but grid 2 plays very well
it's fairly different from grid 1 there
on a effectively a 1.5 version of the
ego engine I believe is what they're
using and the game the controls are
smooth the graphics even though they're
not finalized are pretty good looking
unfortunately there is no more cockpit
mode view and there is no more or I can
get any details on car tweaking like
downforce and ride height and stuff like
that so i'm not sure if they're moving
away from the simulation aspect or not
but i think that about wraps it up for
our first PAX East or first day at pax
east 2013 we will try and do another one
the next at least one night sunday we're
all leaving pretty early so check that
out on the YouTube channel or on the
website and check the links in the
description below for more details on
the stuff we talked about see you all
next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
