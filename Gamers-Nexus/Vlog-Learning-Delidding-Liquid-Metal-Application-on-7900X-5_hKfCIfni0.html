vlog style video I've had to take the
camera and show you some stuff in the
other room and you're still out which
means I'm shooting this myself
hence the vlog style so we got a lot of
stuff in front of me here like nail
polish has purpose for that liquid metal
and D lid kit couple other things CPUs
in various states of lidded nests and
yeah it was it was a long night of
trying to get the D letting stuff and
liquid metal working properly on the
CPUs I'm working on so we're gonna walk
through some of that before getting to
that this video is brought to you by
synergy the software that lets you share
a keyboard and mouse between multiple
systems if you have limited desk space
and multiple computers to command
synergy removes the need for separate
peripherals or a KVM and where it's as
over the network software use our link
below to get 50% off the home or pro
version with ssl okay so first of all I
have some footage of the process of
deleting I used their Bauer's new kit I
think it is called the D lid dime 8x I
believe is the sky like X version and
shot the process of deleting using this
2d lid is actually trivial
it took me minutes to get it done I used
this previously at copy text it's had
some revisions this thing was not
present at Computex and the whole
process was easy we didn't lose any
components it went well what didn't go
well was my first attempt at applying
liquid metal so I'm sure some of you
have used liquid metal before we
actually haven't used it on something
like a CPU service before nothing like
that so this was new to me and that
meant making some mistakes on the way
now fortunately my mistakes were not
that big of a deal and that they were
all correctable but maybe some of you
can learn from this so first of all this
thing this is the thermal grizzly stuff
that they're Bauer kindly sent to me and
it comes out pretty fast so I got way
too much on the die basically and then
the trouble was figuring out what to do
with it so more or less the process
became spreading it around the surface
of the die taking some of that put
the IHS where it should be and ending up
with way too much
having spillover and and then with the
spillover I had a shorted capacitor so
basically it spilled off of the dye and
because this is a sky like X CPU its
7900 X were working with today there's a
reason we're starting with that one
because it is the cheapest CPU that I
will be working with so a $1,000 risk
was a substantially lower risk than some
of the other stuff I'm looking at doing
but basically we had some spillover
skylake X has some capacitors and
resistors and things on the upper
substrate very close to the die which is
a bit different from KB Lake and that
means if it spills over which I had too
much way too much liquid metal on there
so it did it will short stuff now
fortunately for me I only shorted a
capacitor and so I was able to clean it
up basically use some of these black
q-tips that Devourer sent over and
cleaned it up got it off the capacitor
booted and it worked so there's
definitely a scare there that's a big
scare for a moment of like to the point
where I pull dope I open up new egg I
looked at 7,900 X I was like how much do
I want to finish this test because I'd
already done half the test in three days
of work and I'm looking at it like man
I'm not gonna make ROI if I just spend a
thousand dollars but I really want to
finish the test so I had to add into the
cart after some some frustration some
cleaning it up things like that to
realize that one of the capacitors did
come off of the substrate now
fortunately it's just a capacitor so
it's not a critical component everything
boots all the scores are the same in
Cinebench everything validates just fine
and gaming and production workloads all
the scores are identical to previously
and the overclock is about the same so I
think this may have just been some sort
of something that contributed to voltage
ripple suppression or or something like
that I'm speaking with their Bower he
and his team have run into that several
times before where you lose a capacitor
generally the CPU always still works
afterwards so ideally you don't lose
components but this one wasn't a big
deal so we didn't kill anything critical
that was good that was I mean basically
you have to understand my process here
so over the period of the night it was
basically starting at like 12:00 a.m. or
somewhere around there 11:00 p.m. I
deleted the thing there was a it was
pretty easy and obviously I was
uncertain of how that would go but I
mean this is it's really well built and
it's it's pretty hard to screw up you
just you tighten it down until you get
one to two millimeters movement on the
IHS once you get one to two millimeters
movement referencing the RFID chip just
to kind of get a point of reference of
one the dials moves you stop you back it
off and then pull the heatsink straight
up don't don't like push it but pull it
straight up and everything's good
then you proceed with cleaning things
and part of the cleaning process remove
all the Tim and then the other part so
der Bauer had suggested to me to keep it
easy leave the silicone adhesive on the
on the actual substrate rather than just
removing it all and his idea there was
to give me a guy the reference point of
where the I adjust goes back when I'm
ready
and so I scraped down to just a small
black layer for an outline but what I
misunderstood him with was he
specifically said leave it on the
substrate he did not say leave it on my
HS so I left telling IHS as well and the
process here was a lot of things that
could have been done better at once
which is why we started with the cheap
CPU so thing number one too much liquid
metal spilled over shorted a capacitor
is able to clean that up and fix it no
big deal fortunately but it was very
scary because you're looking at a
thousand dollar purchase the next thing
number two that could have been improved
was once I cleaned up the liquid metal I
put the I adjust back on this time with
a lot less liquid metal but still
ultimately too much and so it looked
kind of like a pool of
metal that was reflective rather than a
thin film which is what it should have
been and eventually I got towards that
direction but basically this just it
squirted out a lot more than it expected
and that meant I didn't really I wasn't
sure how much I needed it how to get rid
of it so yeah so that was thing number
two was it was basically after getting
the IHS back on there the second time
and getting it to boot this time without
the smell of smoke without the like oh
it's not posting what happened fear got
it to boot but the temperatures were
twenty Sol's he's higher so obviously
something went wrong spokes at their
bower spoke to VSG from thermal bench
he's got a great website you should
check it out thank you to both of them
for the help and basically after talking
with them finally Durbar pointed out
like send me a picture so it did and I
had too much silicone adhesive around
the IHS still so went through removed it
all reapplied it and booted and actually
I'll take you over to the other room and
show you the where we stand right now
with the thermals you know I should
start with his uh here's a graveyard of
of paper towels from all the thermal
paste and liquid metal I went through so
much thermal paste alright so we have
it's gonna be dark for a second sorry we
have two of these and all of them is
almost completely empty now and that's
thanks to all of the skylight CP is
being so damn big so we went through two
damn fins well not two we went through
almost this entire thermal compound
container anyway I've got it all running
now and it's finally working so this is
my automated test that I scripted we are
was that 400 seconds left out of like
1400
pretty far in running prime95 28.5 and
it is in fact using basically all the
CPU here's the cool bit
so there's our current numbers ignore
that max column that's from something
else
here out the left column so we're down
in the 40s and 50s and I'll have the
full numbers for you in a separate video
so we're gonna do like a full thermal
and power video we've promised this for
a while now with sky like X now that we
have all the parts it's time to execute
and do that
alright so we're back in the set room so
there's a lot more to do and I am going
to have to run a lot of tests on this
deleted and then compare them to the
original test results so so far
everything validates the same scores
outside of thermal limitation scenarios
we are roughly very roughly ok let me
just very roughly normally we do charts
right you all know that what I showed
you was a screen we don't normally do
that but I'm excited about this process
it took me all frickin night to get it
right it should not have so I'm hoping
that this helps some of you who want to
do this in the future so you don't go
through all the stupid things I went
through like really just too much liquid
metal it should be a really thin film
and then it's all good to go smooth
sailing from there so we will have
charts I'm gonna do a whole separate
video on it we might start with 7900 X
and then move laterally from there and
it's it's looking good so far so very
roughly 15 to 20 Celsius decrease but
don't go running to the hills at that
number yet so we've got a lot more to do
that was with a 1.1 5v ID 3.6 gigahertz
locked on a 700 X neither of those
settings are required but they restrict
everything so that we get the same
testing when it had Tim on it as we do
with liquid metal you don't want the
voltage to be auto control they'll jump
all over the place so yeah it's looking
good I'm pretty excited about it
I mean seriously like this is a big move
for us to finally get somewhere with the
skylake power and thermal stuff we were
waiting for the
current clap got that in so we can
finally take measurements at the rails
we've been doing that for maybe a month
or two now probably two months now and
then waiting for one of these got this
in and then we were waiting on really
just the schedule to clear up from Vega
this came in when Vega came in so it got
buried but yeah pretty exciting this
will be just in time for some other
stuff so I guess that's it really
um yeah thank you for watching I know
it's informal I know there's not a lot
of data in here but I'm not trying to
present it as a lot of data it's just
like here was my experience a very quick
recap just for anyone who wants to do
this in the final video I'll talk
through the process more or maybe we'll
do a separate video we might do a
separate like do you a tutorial video
it's trivial to use but it's also a very
expensive mistake to make if you miss
one of those trivial steps so we might
do a video but either way just to recap
this is easy you put the CPU in there
clamp it down with this thing and slowly
tighten to the point where you'll hear a
pop and see very slight movement and
just immediately stop back it out it's
always easier to apply more force later
than it is to to undo the application of
excess force so just stop pull the CPU
out you basically kind of like rock the
IHS and then it should come straight up
like don't push it you'll rip rip caps
and resistors and things so that's easy
liquid metal trying to use a small dot
when I use this and just it way too much
came out and I just wasn't really
positive how much I needed on there so
learn from that if there is a an issue
with boot and oh actually another so
another tip before I get to that
VSG and they're bauer both suggested to
me using either nail polish or basically
like not a captain tape but you could
use an electrical tape that's rated for
like 105 Celsius or something
the nail polish worked well
so you basically put that coat that on
the pastures and things surrounding the
the dye resistors capacitors other SMD
parts and then that will propel the
it'll repel the liquid metal so they'll
keep it out of there so I learned that a
bit later after the first short and it
prevented a second short so that's
pretty cool trick to use very easy to do
cost a few bucks to get one so that's
that's most of it from there you end up
with a thin film on both the dye and the
IHS that's important don't forget the
IHS because you will have worse thermals
without it and if it shorts if if you
can't boot don't panic stop trying to
boot just turn the thing off remove the
processor I know it sucks to redo if
they don't pay is to remove it all and
look under the hood if you've had
spillage clean it up very carefully you
can use q-tips you can use rubbing
alcohol you can use nail polish remover
just make sure it doesn't have too much
acetone in it you can dilute it with
water if you if you're uncomfortable and
try again that should get you there you
just want to be very careful when you're
cleaning the thing not to rip off
components like if you're trying to
scrub with your nail or something else
that's kind of harder and won't conform
to services be careful because you can
rip off tiny component if it's a
capacitor you might very well be okay
you might leave some voltage ripple
suppression or might lose something but
probably not performance if it's
something else
not a capacitor you might be in trouble
so just be really careful but yeah
that's it for this one thank you for
watching kind of different but we'll
have more for you in the near future
