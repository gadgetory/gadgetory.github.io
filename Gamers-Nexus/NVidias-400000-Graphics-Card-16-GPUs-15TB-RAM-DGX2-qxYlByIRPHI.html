now I'm in front of a $400,000 basically
supercomputer most of that cost of
course comes from system memory 1.5
terabytes of that so we just wanted to
show this off and talk through it can't
really get into too much of pulling it
apart or anything like that but we have
an exploded version here with the cover
removed it's got 16 V 100's in it and
then you can see the cooling apparatus
we'll call it on top which is just a
bunch of aluminum fans if you have a
couple copper blocks up front and then
16 of these aluminum fin stacks or on
top of the V 100's underneath so that's
the core specs before that this video is
brought to you by Corsairs new dark core
RGB se Mouse the dark poor RGB se is a
wireless gaming mouse rated for up to 24
hours of continuous wireless gaming with
the LEDs enabled and can be coupled with
a Qi charging mouse pad for easy battery
charging it has both wireless and
Bluetooth antenna so the mouse can be
used easily on two systems and switched
between them learn more at the link in
the description below in terms of power
consumption memory things like that and
video just announced their v 100 has
moved from 16 gigabytes HP m2 to 32
gigabytes of HP m2 which is what's in
each one of these totaling for 512
gigabytes of total HP m2 between all the
GPUs in the system obviously not a
gaming device therefore no gaming
announcements but this is still kind of
interesting technology so one of the
other items to talk about would be power
consumption as noted a CPU server system
as we understand it skylake or something
like that
would consume about I think it's a 180
kilowatts was the numbers cited and this
is at 10 kilowatts which considering
what it does is significantly lower than
the CPU equivalent system in terms of
other specs at the major announcement
from Nvidia in terms of hardware was not
a new GPU architecture but the expansion
of 32 gigabytes on volta or on the V 100
and then also the NV switch which is in
here we have an article on it on the
website if you want to learn more about
+ V switch you can click the article
link to the description below but there
are 12 MB switches in here they are
basically interconnect they connect to
all of these 16 GPUs and they function
both ways so each GPU can communicate
individually
with each other GPU out of the total 16
in the system and that's done through
envy switch which enables the bandwidth
required to push that data it's just
under 1 terabyte per second of bandwidth
at 50 gigabytes per second per port and
I believe there are I want to say 18
ports on Envy switch other specs for the
system - Xeon Platinum's in it as noted
1.5 terabytes of system memory and then
30 terabytes of nvme SSD storage as well
for local processing this is all
supposed to be network attached to the
rest of it happens over the network as
expected with any type of data center
type of device so I think I think that
pretty much walks you through it if you
want to buy one it's $400,000 I'd put an
affiliate link in the description so I
can pick up 10,000 of commission if I
could but I don't think anyone's gonna
buy one either way though
that's the new Nvidia stuff we'll talk
about more and other coverage subscribe
for that as always click the link in the
description below for the envy switch
article thank you for watching I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
