brief disclaimer before we start this
video this is some kind of gameplay
footage of when we were actually did
really well with a surprise bomb plant
and almost recovered the game on the
loss we were not expecting to be
recording this so the audio levels may
be a little bit wacky but I did my best
to equalize them just enjoy the gameplay
but we did a cool job so check it out
left side
I'm going to try to run over to where
the parties
this guy just walked right by
I was hiding behind my medikit
real i have a ticket yeah I try to plant
probably if you can find it I can see it
come out on an island in the water all
right it's planted
