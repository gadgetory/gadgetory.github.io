for at least a month we are back to
catch up on some news so the first thing
of course was until opt in for the week
that was announced on sunday the P 4800
xdrive that's covered in a separate
video not going over that again here
today we're focusing on rise and updates
that would be efi changes on the asus
and gigabyte boards also be talking
about 10 a TTI launches from different
vendors for their AIB partner cards and
then we have some news on a mini Polaris
GPU speaking of 1080i launched as though
this video is brought to you by EVGA GTX
1080 ti FTW 3 card using the new ITX
temperature monitoring solution for vrm
and vram thermals the cara de should
become available within the next few
weeks link in the description below for
more information on that let's start off
with some rising news since that's
gotten the most buzz lately asus has
been pushing efi updates almost non-stop
since rise in the r7 chips launched and
their newest one is for the crosshair
six boards the one that we've been using
them our testing this newest efi update
improves the auto overclocking
functionality and overall over Calculon
memory higher speed frequency stability
with the rising platform more than the
previous updates would allow in terms of
at least two auto OC and auto voltage
and things like that acs noted that
version 5704 was still talking higher
for them with manual tuning but this is
a seven right direction for the complete
update the efi this screenshots i was
sent to us by asus demonstrates
improvements in the new efi revs auto OC
settings which allowed the company to
hit 3.9 gigahertz on an r 7 1700 while
running a 1.3 95b core memory is a bit
more interesting here acs was able to
achieve a 3200 megahertz frequency with
manual eat into timings on a g.skill kit
this kit was with bside dies so this is
a samsung the b-side dye kit these do
better with overclocking better with
higher frequencies on the rising
platform then the hynix kids currently
do asus will launch a final march efi
update with all the AMD generic
capsulated that software architecture
code changes so we're waiting for that
final push before updating our own test
platform and that's the update that will
contain all the recent changes from this
month hopefully in one build gigabyte
also has an update to its X 370 gaming 5
board which comes in the form of an f5 d
efi Rev that's in beta currently
previously it was at 5c which was also
beta Rev so they are working toward a
stable f5 raveh efi and generally the
story is the same here as it is for all
the other motherboard vendors right now
which is memory support is improved with
that 5d just like memory supporters
improves with most other efi updates on
the X 370 mp3 fizzy platforms today the
next segment of product launch is to
talk about are the 1080p is we're going
to breeze through a few of these we
don't have any of these in hand yet
though are expecting a few of them it's
not all of them at some point and
basically we're looking at the Asus
gigabytes and msi variants of the 1080i
EVGA as we've previously spoken about
which was the 1080 TI FTW 3 that's a 3
fan cooler gigabyte has a new rs3 fan
cooler ACS has a 3 fan cooler so that
seems to be a bit of a trend for this
generation of TI cards gigabytes 1080i
or extreme edition will host 3 fans it
takes three full slots with its thicker
cooler and we're still waiting on review
samples for the card but we know so far
that it will host a DVI connector where
the fe card did not the founders edition
card and the most notable changes just
again the thickness of the card this
card with its three fans looks to be
using about 90 millimeter fan diameters
the center fan rest below the top two
fans and a tan inverse orientation that
will have to wait till we get hands-on
to see how it actually performs and how
the noise levels are a significant
portion of the heat sink is covered by
the shroud which is something we hope to
look more into if we receive that sample
and alongside Gigwise RS cards there's
the new msi 1080 TI gaming x which
sports the usual twin frozer dual fan
cooler design that we've detailed
several times in the past the MSI card
that looks to be using a mix of the old
r9 390
X heat sync with the newer twin frozr
fans and shroud this card also appears
that fatter than previous 10 series
gaming x coolers which is made more
noticeable by its back plate and the
fake baseplate flanking the PCB there
are two 8-pin power connectors present
on the card it will have a pre overclock
and that's about all we know about it
right now finally the new asus 1080i rog
Strix and acs 1080i turbo cards have
also been showcased recently the naming
scheme is the same as previous aces
cards the turbo is a blower style cooler
with a plastic shroud the DB low-end
market we're not sure if asus is
targeting a lower price on the fe card
maybe with the help of rebates seeing as
the reference card actually has a good
PCB this time it'll be a bit of a
challenge for the AV partners to compete
with Nvidia's own reference model the
strict card is a different story this
one uses yet another three fan cooling
design you don't know a ton about this
one yet other than yes it will have a
pre OC one is on the way for review and
it will support the aura sink RGB
lighting that 80's has been pushing
lately that's about all we know for
today this borders more on rumours than
news but it's close enough at this point
that it might as well be news there was
a leak on compy bench which is a website
that contains some compute benchmarks
and things like that of an alleged RX
500 series card it's not really named it
doesn't really have a GPU identifier yet
but it is a polaris card it looks like
our x 500 assuming the leak is to be
believed and in theory that card will be
hosting pensee used with 640 stream
processors so at that sort of size for
the GPU it would theoretically ship
below the RS 4 60 in price and target
market because it's going to be less
powerful than an RX for 60 but that's
really all we know right now so that is
a bit of a leak the arch 500 series
theoretically will exist at some point
it's rumored to be a polaris refresh not
a complete brand new series with Vega
taking on its architecture name vega as
the video card branding in other brief
news the thermaltake Korpi 1tg that we
saw CES is finally shipping and ended up
being priced at around a hundred dollars
we like the unit
where it's wall mount capabilities and
smaller form factors of the nature of
being accessible like a test bench is
also appealing aside from this course is
that now shipping the K 6310 keyless
keyboard which is a plastic shell rather
than the company's usual aluminum focus
the k63 will use a cherry MX red
switches perky LED backlighting the
color red only on this one and dedicated
media keys the price tag for the K 63
looks to be about eighty dollars though
you could buy the slightly older k 65
aluminum-bodied keyboard for seventy
dollars if you prefer that and if RGB is
a necessity obviously step up into 100
120 dollar range for other course their
offerings so that's all for this news
