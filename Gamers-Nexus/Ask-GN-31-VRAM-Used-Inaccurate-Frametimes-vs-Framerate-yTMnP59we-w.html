episode of ask gee Enron 31 now so as
always if you have questions post them
in the comment section below we'll try
and address them I've got a couple good
ones here this time testing methodology
and otherwise before getting to the SPN
questions this content is brought to you
by Andy freesync products including this
algae monitor I've got next to me this
is a 34 inch monitor 34 40 by 1440 and
it is a an affordable one at eight
hundred twenty seven dollars so we've
talked about these before the Acer
predator the g-sync monitor I have that
we've tested with for 30 for 40 by 1440
that one we've talked about before it's
the most expensive one I've worked with
it's north of a thousand dollars so that
monitor is the one that we basically
published some data on said hey 34 40 by
1440 is really not that hard of a
resolution to sustain if you've got
these newer video cards the $300 plus
cards especially even though our X 480
does okay with them gtx 1060 does okay
with them just depends on how much
you're willing to sacrifice for your
settings to play on an ultra wide
resolution but we've got some content on
that and I really do think if you've got
an issue where like in some of our use
cases where you're out of physical real
estate on the desk it's sometimes easier
to fit in ultra wide whether it's this
one or the predator it doesn't matter if
it's a sponsor or not it is just easier
to fit an ultra wide in some spaces and
from production standpoint I do prefer
working with them so that is the the
plug I guess we extended a bit there and
talked about a stirs product as well but
that's kind of what we do edge yeah so
first question this week is from dr.
noob arias who says why is it that one
using a frame rate higher than the
refresh rate the game's a look and feel
smoother this is a really good question
I've talked about this in the past and a
couple different content pieces I'll do
a flyby here for more depth we have a
convey do from probably CES 2014 or
something where I spoke with Nvidia on
camera about g-sync
in that video we explained how how
missing or hitting refresh cycles on a
display can impact your fluidity of
framerate and same thing we talked with
AMD at CES I think last year about free
sync or maybe I just talked so low on
that one but same idea so to recap it
quickly there are a few variables here
one of them the question for those who
maybe don't follow it's as simple as if
I've got say 130 fps pushing out of my
video card but my monitors 60 Hertz why
does it feel smoother the answer the
main part of the answer I think anyway
is because of the latency between the
frames so when we talk about the 1% and
point 1% lows that many of you are
familiar with in the in the review
content
those numbers are extrapolated by or
extracted I should say by taking a
variable called on present so there's a
couple different variables when you
measure a framerate it's not just you
measure the framerate of a game and its
output strictly as FPS depending on your
tool our tools including presentment and
I guess for apps to some degree will
output rather the frame number so say we
record 3000 frames in a 30-second
sequence or something like that then it
would be from one frame to frame 354 and
then the other number that's plotted
against that is the frame time the
milliseconds so milliseconds between
frames some do a delta and some do
cumulative so depending on that you may
have frame 1 happened at 0 milliseconds
frame to having at 13 milliseconds 3
happened at 26 milliseconds so that's
how the the date is recorded then from
there you can pull the FPS number by
just doing some calculations pretty
simple stuff can be done on a
spreadsheet you just need a formula to
do it and determine how many frames per
second you're getting so that's how the
data is created in the charts that we
use where you get an average of 1% of
point understand as for how it impacts
the fluidity the reason we use these
numbers is because when you're testing
frame times the important thing is not
just how quickly the frames come out
with the FPS number but also how
consistent the frames are from one to
the next so if you've got a hundred plus
frames coming out of your video card
through on present which
more of an engine level measurement and
you're measuring say a frame time
consists of a consistent frame time
output one frames the next of a couple
milliseconds five eight milliseconds
something like that that basically
guarantees you're never gonna miss a
refresh on the monitor depending on your
vsync or adaptive sync settings I'm not
going to go into every single of the
combinations permutations here but
depending on your settings there it
means you'll never miss a sync on the
monitor so that happens at if you've got
a 60 Hertz monitor it would be I think
16 milliseconds every 16 milliseconds it
should refresh 60 Hertz so that's that
seems about right it's eight
milliseconds I believe for a 120 Hertz
so you never miss one of those that's
one thing the next thing regardless of
sync settings even if you've got vsync
disabled and you have no adaptive sync
like free sync this thing would have
orgy sync the competition to this thing
if you've got no adaptive sync no vsync
the next thing to look at are going to
be dips so the dips in frame rate
throughput are probably going to be less
and bad you're less likely to fall below
the refresh on the display if let's I
don't know what this refresh is off the
top of my head but let's just pretend
this monitors a 60 Hertz refresh and we
have no free sink enabled so if it's 60
Hertz refresh and we start dipping to 20
30 FPS and our low values not only is
that visible anyway because the it'll
just look like a stutter in gameplay you
start entering into territory of either
tearing or stuttering depending on again
you're seeing setting the vsync will
eliminate tearing but can introduce
stuttering if you fall below the refresh
rate of the display and no vsync means
that you get a lot of tearing but
depending on if your what your frame
rate is but you eliminate stuttering so
normally when you talked something like
an eSports player they will almost
always favor tearing to stuttering
because in one event with a tear it's
basically you imagine a frame being
drawn and then a new frame starts
getting drawn on top of it when a
monitor paints a frame it does it from
the top left to the bottom right so
actually if you if you took a super
high-speed camera or just even a screen
capture solution and he measured as it
drew frames you would see it painting
pixels from the top left to the top
right and all the way down till you got
to the bottom right that obviously
happens exceptionally fast but that is
part of the sort of what you're looking
at when when there's a tear so if
there's a tear
it'll be an instance where you might
have a tree vertical object that you can
see is no longer aligned because one
frame has drawn on top of another and
there's a runt frame there we call it or
if there's stuttering it's the opposite
issue where the frames come out just
fine and they're complete frames no real
tearing in your graphics and your
textures but instead it'll kind of feel
like there's a repeat so it'll take the
previous frame and effectively reproject
it that's more of a VR term but you get
the idea we protect the previous frame
and then you have sort of missing data
for the the one frame you're on
currently until the next one draws that
happens when you've missed a refresh
like on the monitor so if your monitor
is expecting a frame every eight or 16
milliseconds it doesn't draw on time it
misses that refresh and then reproject
the previous frame then the next eight
or 16 milliseconds cycle you'll get a
new frame so that's 8 to 16 milliseconds
in there where you have no frame that's
perceived to the user as a stutter so I
think that starts to answer the question
that's if you have a higher frame rate
these things are less of a concern
you're gonna be above thresholds where
it's more visible to the user higher
frame rate generally not always if you
look at our battlefield 1 results
generally a higher frame rate does
coincide with better frame times not
always the case again but if you have
better frame times you're less likely to
have those noticeable dips and the
inconsistency is what kills it so you
could have a 100 FPS output but if you
have frame times that are 10 10 10
milliseconds 10 milliseconds 10
milliseconds then you have one that's 18
or
for doesn't have to be multiple that
something like that then you'll notice
it that does tend to happen more often
with a lower end device or with lower
frame rate than not so I said I wasn't
gonna explain the whole thing but I
think that basically explains the whole
thing that was in the previous content
you can still find more if you're
curious about it we've written about it
before on the website click on specs
dictionary and click on you can read
about screen tearing screens hurry and
I've got information there next question
is Adrian cavity who says why are games
most Triple A games don't utilize the
extra power of hyper-threading doesn't
make any sense that most modern games
require four cores and not utilizing
CPUs with more than four cores or with
hyper-threading thanks for answering
this is a good place to go and look at
our interview with Sean Tracy from the
star citizen team specifically the
interview where we talk about CPU thread
management and if someone wants to dig
that up and post it in the comments
below that'd be great cuz I'm gonna keep
listing things to go to and forget to
link them in the description but we
talked about job management there that's
part of it basically this is on a
development side engine side more than
anything the engines need to be all
modernized to support more threads
CryEngine they made a big deal out of
this maybe two and a half years ago when
CryEngine started supporting eight
threads that was a big deal and the way
they did it then is different from now
back then an engine would basically say
we have a game render thread that's
generally core 1 or thread one that
starts really get abused and we have a
an audio thread of physics thread and AI
thread and so on I don't have all of
them I've thought my head but that's
that's there's the core ones so
generally with engines you will see most
the abuse on the first court regardless
of whether you have hyper threading and
a lot of these engines really only
efficiently utilize two cores even
though they might ask for four as a
requirement the other two might just be
juggling AI which sometimes is
non-existent or very low load Japan what
you're playing and then of course audio
is generally the other one so that is
that is
largely an engine factor now as for
hyper-threading specifically there are a
few games where you can see a
hyper-threading benefit one of them as
I've mentioned before is Metro last
light it's more of a benchmark than a
game at this point but it proves the
concept that in the averages with Metro
last light with hyper-threading without
hyper-threading you'll see that they
look pretty much the same but when
looking at the low performance mister
apparently a 1% lower values that we
test those can be gapped as much as 2x
depending on what video card is being
tested and that's because of hyper
threading being disabled you get a big
reduction point 1% in that game so
that's potentially more stutters visible
sometimes we would see I don't know the
specific card but this was during the
900 series where I was very confused for
about a week because my results were
testing the same way as previously but
they looked different in the low numbers
and that was because hyper threading was
disabled so it is largely game sight
issue though and an engine side issue I
will probably see more SMT which is the
sort of base technology that hyper
threading is Intel's version we'll see
more SMT support I think going forward
because then we'll also be using SMT now
so maybe developers will have more
reason to actually explicitly support a
lot of threads but still end of the day
it's still a lot of thread 1 and thread
2 occupation lower-level api's made it
assist with that in the future because
rendered tasks are getting moved off of
thread 1 which is bottleneck and
everything in the in the sequence
because the sequential processor next
question is Teemo for life he's
definitely posted before says
overclocking my monitor safe will it
reduce the lifespan I clocked - 66 Hertz
is it worth it
66 Hertz I don't know if that's worth it
it's a you got a 10% overclock it's not
really a big deal can you really
perceive an extra 6 FPS basically is the
question maybe you can but we've done
articles on this Michael Kern's one of
our writers is more of an expert on this
than I am he's done a lot of monitor
overclocking the the quick answer is
that we're talking safe know it is never
say
if it's it's sort of safe with GPUs
these days they do have things to stop
you from really damaging something but
if you really start playing around with
things following guides that are more
advanced and using tools that maybe you
shouldn't then know it's it's not safe
you can always damage something like
unlocking voltage or whatever flashing
bios in the case of video cards as four
monitors specifically you can pretty
safely adjust within a reasonable range
10 percent is normally fine we've gotten
up to 80 Hertz I think on 60 Hertz
displays and normally the Korean
displays will support this better the
ones without scalars but those tend to
be the ones to play around with because
you get them cheap you can overclock
them I've read stories about people
heading 100 Hertz or hundred twenty
Hertz I've never done that myself or
seen it in person
so that would certainly be worth it if
you could hit that but you are going to
burn out the display faster potentially
as for a few reasons one that wasn't
built to handle that and to these things
especially like the predator that I'm
dealing with do generate a good amount
of heat it's a lot of power to drive a
display and you got to think about it
like there's I'm looking at the back of
this one there's really no ventilation
there's a little bit of ventilation in
the bottom it feels like but that's
really all you get for displays a lot of
heat radiates out of the front but there
is he inside where all of the logic and
the PCB any power components would be
and when you're overclocking anything
you're generally increasing the power to
the device the whatever's doing the
oscillating cycle it's an overclock it
and increasing the power increases the
temperature there's no active cooling in
there generally not in any of the
monitors I use anyway so that yeah you
could probably shorten the lifespan if
you're not too careful but read our
overclocking guide though for monitors
specifically that will address the
question very directly for for anyone
who's interested in doing it we have a
how-to as well in there one of the next
questions is
foreign gaming text says damn Steve you
always look so tired yes my question
would be as far as I've heard most of
the monitoring applications show
requested via Ram not actually used VRAM
so it shows how much the game wants not
how much it uses how true is that are
there ways to measure occupied V RAM
instead of requested that is true and
that is accurate if you're using GPUs II
and it says this game is using four
gigabytes of video memory and you have a
four gigabyte card it doesn't mean that
you're cashing out of your memory are
you exceeding your memory limitation
what it probably means is that the game
said I want four gigabytes of video RAM
available and so that's it allocated it
doesn't mean it's getting used now you
can test this theory if you plug in
something like a twelve gigabyte Titan X
and it starts black ops starts
requesting twelve gigabytes of memory
then we know there's really no way this
game is using twelve gigabytes of video
memory actually you could put an eight
gigabyte card or six gigabyte card and
it probably it performs the same clock
for clock spectra spec but it's
requesting all of us yes that is true
measuring accurately can be done with
low-level api's the ISPs are generally
doing it I think years of war actually
taps into its real vram consumption but
I'm not positive on that so that's
that's maybe the feature but no software
exists that I am aware of that would
accurately tell you how much video RAM
is actually used
I'm sure someone like coarser would be
able to build something like that
because they work with memory as a
business but we don't have anything and
as far as I'm aware there's no good
public tool that is accurate for that
next question fd1 you mentioned in the
previous video that Intel's PR has
changed the point where you would rather
buy it that would be the CPU than
request one for review could you
elaborate on that
what has changed specifically if he
could walk us through the process of
acquiring tech review I'll keep this
short
elaborate on Intel's PR changing I mean
just this happens all the time in
history PR people move around a lot
everyone in the distri moves all around
pyaare especially though on one end it
can be good if they move to another
company we can get connection with the
company we may not have talked to before
because there's PR there that we're
familiar with the other had it could be
bad because you might not have a way to
get back in touch with the company that
they left in Intel's case it was an
internal shuffling and I just I've
probably been put in contact with four
or five people in the last two years I
can't keep track of them have them don't
reply because their job titles change
without me knowing of course why would
me if they don't make a public
announcement about it so it's too much
work to try and keep in touch with
people at Intel they're a large company
it's easier to buy the product or get it
through an SI and use it as a loner and
then send it back later so that's the
the short of that and then as for what's
the process of getting a product to
review its is basically eight years of
establishing a brand and demanding
respect for in-depth work which there's
not a whole lot of these days a non tech
tech report P Z perspective legit
reviews certainly but not a whole lot of
it now and I think that kind of
generally does actually get respect so
it's basically just email and ask for it
we have to turn away a lot of products
there's plenty more that are not
finished being tested yet because it's
too much comes in so we actually a lot
of the time these days they reach out to
us ask if we want it and I have to turn
away a lot of stuff because I don't want
to accept it if we can't actually review
it so that's kind of process pretty
simple
last question Curie Gio Taku has gonna
be good I'm sure dear Steve can we get a
sexy hair flip at the end of the video
