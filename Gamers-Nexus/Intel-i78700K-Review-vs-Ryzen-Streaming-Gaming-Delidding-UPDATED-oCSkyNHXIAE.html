CPUs have undoubtedly been planned since
before aizen's launched it appears that
AMD woke the sleeping giant this year
after some prods from risin and from
thread ripper intel's i7 8700 k launches
today it's a 6 quart 12 thread part that
targets high frequencies and that launch
is accompanied by a target MSRP of $360
about a 10 to 20 dollar price increase
over kb lake this is the competition
part of the market intel moved up the X
299 launched to compete with thread
Ripper but what we'll never know is
whether Intel adjusted its target price
to compete with risin at least on the
coffee leg CPUs
either way the i7 8700 K is here now and
we've got a densely packed review
covering most aspects of the new CPU
lineup this video is brought to you by
the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900 white
Edition the DBP 900 marks a return to
full tower cases equipped with ample
harddrive support effective noise
damping foam high performance fans and
the option to be inverted into an
alternative layout the tinted tempered
glass window and Qi charger at a high
untouched to an already well-built case
learn more at the link in the
description below so lots of things to
know for this review first of all we got
the worst-possible 8700 K sample that
could be made the overclocking head room
on ours was much worse in terms of
voltage versus frequency than what many
of our peers got so while I am envious
of the other CPU samples out there it at
least gave us an excuse to step through
a couple hours worth of trying every
trick in the book to get the thing the
clock a little bit higher we ended up
stuck at about 4.9 gigahertz but kind to
hit 5.0 and the thing is I've got a
screenshot from their Bower I can share
on the screen he is giddy at the CPU he
got I mean der bauer he has a couple of
them and that one in particular does 5.2
gigahertz it's something like one point
three seven five volts or somewhere
around there the guy is lucky that's a
crazy overclock ours shows just how the
Silicon lottery works
why companies and websites like Silicon
lottery are in existence our CPU does
four point nine to 5.0 at about one
point four to one point four to volts
depending on the test and at 5.0 we
can't pass blender even with one point
forty volts so a little disappointed
there but we still did the deal eighteen
fainted liquid metal all that stuff
plenty of stuff to do
still it overclocked to four point nine
or 5.0 where it held and we haven't
tried overclocking since applying liquid
metal so there might be more room in
there now because we've got more thermal
Headroom to increase the voltage further
we've reduced power leakage things like
that doing everything that we can to
push the thing further and we'll do that
in the follow-up content piece along
with tomorrow's content piece for the
next day which will be the i-5 review
from Coffey Lake today we're focusing on
the 8700 K these tests will be a mixture
of legacy tests from our test suite so
we've got a couple old ones that were
slowly phasing out and we have new tests
coming in the reason we have both is
because we ran them both in parallel so
8700 k went through the old test and
then the new tests and that's because
the new tests don't have ten years worth
of CPUs on them in terms of I mean over
the past year we've tested CPUs going
back ten years and so those are not
present on the new benchmarks but they
are on the old one so we ran both and
parallel that way you get a sense for
scaling so we're gonna pop up the
timestamps for this video the table of
contents whatever you want to call it
and that's because this is densely
packed and all the disclaimers aside now
we'll have thermals and elating
overclocking blender premiere gaming all
that stuff and you can jump around if
you want to though we'd obviously
encourage you to watch all of it because
it all comes together in the end and
paints a pretty clear picture of how
this cpu performs but it is dense in
terms of charts and we'll have all of
those in the article linked in the
description below if you wanted all on
one page for easier reference in the
future we'll start this one with
thermals and D lidding since that's been
a popular topic for us lately running
these tests with fixed frequencies and
voltages as that's the only way to
properly control for fluctuations and
behavior we used rocket cools @d LED kit
to remove the IHS which will link below
this proves trivial to use and works
flawlessly which for a forty dollar kit
is pretty damn good we can recommend
this one for coffee like dee lids the
previous model for KB Lake also works
here and D letting the 8700 K is easier
than the sky like xcp use as it lacks
the dual substrate layout deleting the
CPU was it matched with removing the
silicon adhesive from only the IHS we
left it on the substrate for now and
then we applied a thermal grizzly
conduct or not liquid metal will link
that in the description as well if
you're interested in it and you can
check some of our previous d-league
content for more information on
performance with skylight gags let's
start with the more exaggerated results
when testing blender with a four point
nine gigahertz frequency and one point
four core voltage our 8700 K with Intel
Tim and an end exp X 62 landed at 76
degrees Celsius average core temperature
with a 10-second peak of seventy six
point six C and a liquid temperature of
40 point six five C the liquid metal
version at the same frequency and
voltage measured at 52 point five nine
degrees Celsius that's a reduction in
average core temperature of nearly 24 C
liquid temperature measured about the
same as before at thirty nine point
eight to see looking into this further
we realized that measured at the current
clamp on the EPS 12-volt rails the 8700
K with Tim was drawing about 10 to 20
watts more power at the same voltage and
frequency we're not yet positive but our
present theory is that this outcome as a
result of reduced power leakage on the
CPU as a result of energy transfer
efficiency improvement from the die to
the IHS by way of using the conductor
not liquid metal which is about 73 watts
per meter Kelvin thermal conductivity
versus something like three so that
would explain part of the power leakage
reduction testing with prime95 28.5 on
the cpu lock to 4.7 gigahertz core 1.3
5v core
we found the delta much closer than in
the earlier over volted tests the Tim
test plants us at sixty two point six
degrees Celsius average core temperature
with a 10 second high at 63 point eight
two
liquid temperatures effectively matched
to the liquid metal version at thirty
nine point six verses thirty nine point
HC and that's within our test error and
resolution so we can just call them
effectively equal using tinactin aught
we're at fifty two point five nine C for
a 10 degree reduction in average core
temperature which is a pretty reasonable
gain though the previous gain was much
more impressive this isn't as big of a
deal as with the sky like act CP is when
we were constrained by thermal limits
with overclocking the coffee lake CP is
run much cooler we think I've consulted
with some folks about this we think that
there's potentially better Tim on the
coffee like CPUs which would coincide
with some hints that Intel's given but
we have no way to really properly
validate that we can't scrape and test
the thermal conductivity of the Tim it's
just not feasible for us so that said
coffee like actually does run reasonably
cool all things considered it starts
getting a little warm once you have four
point nine gigahertz and one point four
volts but up until that point it's
really not bad but the thermal scaling
at the higher voltages and frequencies
does ramp pretty aggressively it's not a
linear increase so keep that in mind a
10 to 20 degree reduction though is no
small feat and does mean you can
potentially reduce the rpm on your
coolers lower noise things like that and
it's good for anyone pushing higher over
clocks as well where you're gonna run
into potential thermal limits with the
lower end or smaller coolers so for the
kits we used I'm gonna go ahead and give
a shout again to rock it cool because
they sent us that kit a while ago for KB
Lake we finally used it and it worked
well so if you're interested check them
out
conduct an artwork has worked well for
us also and then if this stuff is scary
to you gonna give a quick shout to
Silicon Lottery calm because I've heard
they're going to have been two CPUs
within one to two weeks of launch and we
worked with them previously on a KB Lake
CPU so those services are all options if
you want to either deal it yourself deal
it yourself
probably don't do that but if you want
to deal with the CPU yourself and apply
liquid metal it's a 10
20 degrees pretty damn good so consider
it whether its DIY or not but it's
definitely not necessary unlike skylake
acts you will not be thermally
constrained on the overclocks
with coffee lake on a reasonably sized
cooler as opposed to the 79 60 X where
we were actually 200 megahertz higher by
adding liquid metal so that isn't as big
a change as sky acts but still a pretty
good change next set of tests we have to
streaming and recording tests prior to
the game in workloads for the first test
we're benchmarking that live streaming
capabilities as encoded on the CPU using
OBS and x264 with the faster preset
outputting to YouTube at 10 megabits per
second 1080p 60 the second test is done
with local recording captured at 15
megabits per second so Internet's not an
issue and using x264 fast for the preset
so it is a better encoding option for
higher quality the second test is far
more intensive versus the two and is
more likely to stress the CPU into a
point of dropping frames even if
somewhat of a synthetic test we'll start
with the easier workload streaming dirt
rally to YouTube at 10 megabits per
second and with the faster preset we end
up encoding 100% of the frames out of
both the 8700 K and the r7 1700 with
effectively no dropped frames on either
we didn't overclock either because it
just wasn't necessary we are at or below
0.1% drop frames on the r7 1700 but
that's within test variance and margins
so effectively zero at this quality
setting the to produce the same viewer
experience for the stream the 7700 K
drops 44 percent of its frames prior to
the process prioritization tweak that we
did with the overclocked variant
dropping about 30% of its frames
manually assigning processed priority
allowed the 7700 K to deliver 100% of
its frames dropping zero but did require
manual tuning and had another hit to
performance that we'll see in a moment
the 8700 K the coffee lake CPU and the
r7 1700 both avoid this prioritization
requirement for this particular test and
they were perfectly fine at delivering
the full experience to the viewer so
they both pass
this one the next side of the coin is
player experience shown in FPS the 8700
K delivers a baseline performance of 136
FPS average with no stream the output
with 1% frame times measured at 109 or
98 FPS for 0.1% lows streaming drops us
down to 122 FPS average really not a bad
drop with 1% lows at 87 which is also
not bad 0.1% lows however have fallen
down to 37 FPS which seems a trend for
all of our streams outputs thus far
there are seven 1,700 places at 108 FPS
average base line with its streaming
output at 91 or 65 FPS for the one
percent lows and 37 for 0.1% lows this
comes down to threads versus frequency
as an argument
Rison has more threads at a lower
frequency and the game wants frequency
but the stream wants threads it's able
to keep up with both reasonably but has
a hit to game performance whereas the
Intel alternative 8700 K but again it's
got the extra couple thread so give and
take as needed but that's the last
generation the 8700 K adds two more
cores and four more threads while
keeping a similar frequency this
significantly improves on the 7700 k's
former position and manages to keep up
with these 1,700 of these settings when
streaming with a faster frame rate when
gaming this is more of a worst-case
scenario meant to stress CPUs to a point
of showing differences we're recording
locally at 15 megabits per second and
using the fast preset done for both dirt
and dota 2 with dirt we deliver 54.6% of
frames to the recording dropping 45.4%
the r7 1700 however manages to deliver
57.8% of its frames dropping 42.2% extra
threads are helping in the encoding
process here and managed to push the r7
1,700 stock CPU into lead over the 8700
k stock cpu where the r7 outperforms by
a few percentage points and delivered
frames to the stream it does technically
deliver them with more variable latency
the 8700 K delivers its 54.6% of frames
with at ninety point eight percent of
them averaging the desired
16 point six six seven milliseconds so
that
be your 60fps refresh roughly 4.6
percent of these are above these 16.7
millisecond range and about 4.6 below
that rain the r7 1700 cpu delivers its
percentage of frames 57.8 so higher with
seventy five point six percent of those
frames averaging 16 points seven
milliseconds just under 11 percent are
faster than sixteen point seven and just
under 14% are slower than sixteen point
seven milliseconds as for fps the 8700 k
average is 136 fps baseline without any
capture interference and the r7 average
is 108 FPS average baseline neither CPU
drops very far in its captured
performance we fall to 126 FPS average
on the 8700 K and 92 FPS average on the
r7 1700 which amount to a seven point
four percent reduction and fourteen
point eight percent reduction from
baseline respectively both CPUs have
room in player side FPS to improve
capture side delivery there's not much
point in spending all of those CPU
resources on fps for the player to get
above 100 FPS when considering that the
recording just can't keep up the 8700 K
has more room to play with in this
particular title in this manner and has
greater consistency despite a slight
deficit in total frame delivery with
dota 2 under the same conditions the
story changes a bit the r7 1700 captures
85 percent of its frame successfully
driving 14.9% in this torture workload
the i7 8700 K captures 68 percent of its
frames successfully playing these files
back side-by-side the result is obvious
in this particular title the r7 1700
does provide a better capture output
than the 8700 K though neither is ideal
for our torture workload you'd want to
drop settings a little bit on the 1700
to recoup those 15 percent of dropped
frames but you'd have to drop
significantly on the 87 Hart K or start
tuning with priorities here's a look at
the frame rate chart this give us a
better idea as to where the 8700 K is
power is going baseline performance is
158 FPS average for the 8700 K or 80 FPS
for 1 percent load this is significantly
bolstered over the 110 FPS average m56
fps 1% lows of the
seven 1700 which is already known to
drag a bit in dota 2 beginning the game
capture the 8700 K drops 36% of its
frame throughput to 101 FPS average with
these 1,700 dropping a similar 35% of
its frame throughput but delivers more
of its frames to the stream or the
recording capture where the 8700 K
significantly now performs the r7 1700
in player side frame rate it is
significantly underperforming and
capture frame rate for this particular
title giving process priority to OBS
would solve this problem largely as
would an overclock that's exiting out of
box territory and just because these
sort of synthetic torture workloads make
it so that people often lose sight of
the original real world scenario both of
these CPUs are perfectly fine for
streaming and capture at 1080p 62
YouTube at 10 megabits per second you
can even go a bit higher than that
especially if you start tuning the x264
preset and you're really not gonna have
to do much with priorities unless you're
trying to do something like a fast or a
medium preset then you might need to
give it will be as process priority
let's move on to power testing and we'll
have more power tests in the article
linked below but we can start with just
a few for now starting with blender the
i7 8700 K pulls about 96 watts down the
EPS 12-volt cables this is not power
draw from the wall it's measured with
the current clamp this is the stock
configuration and permits the CPU to
complete the render in twenty six point
six minutes our seven 1700 poles about
80 watts in this configuration
completing the render in around 29
minutes more on that later
overclocking the 8700 k puts us up to
130 watts when at 4.9 gigahertz and one
point 4 volts on our magically awful
chip this is right around where our
overclocked r7 17-hundred lands for
power the i7 77 100k stock CPU measures
74 watts for this test marking at about
20 watts lower than the 8700 K a lot of
this has to do with motherboard and BIOS
as well as always so these numbers would
change based on which board you're using
and how much voltage it pushes for the
fire strike physics test - the 87 100k a
plots at 68 watts under its stock
configuration or one
six overclocked for comparison the 1700
draws about 55 watt stock 95 overclock
and the 7700 case it's around 50 watts
with our gaming 7 motherboard on the
latest efi this is the important part
for the gaming tests going forward so
for these we're starting with our legacy
benchmarks first these are conducted
completely differently from the rest of
the game test that we're using moving
forward and will stand as a long-term
support option that allows you to
compare against a lot of CPUs but it's
being phased out because it's becoming
less accurate with time that's because
the legacy tests that we have done for
the past year now are now outdated in a
few ways video card drivers windows
version and the graphics card we're
starting to bump into GPU limits in some
games going forward we're using a 1080
Ti FTW three for the GPU rather than a
1080 FTW one non TI and we've updated
our memory time in timings we've updated
our Windows version we've updated our
graphics drivers so the tests are not
comparable between them just to make
that clear starting with two legacy
charts in battlefield one the 8700
k-chart tops at 151 FPS average placing
it a few percent ahead of the 7700 K as
for scalability it goes like this the
Intel i7 930 Nehalem CPU runs at 96 FPS
average and is about 10 years old with
the overclocked variant at 118 FPS
average the i7 2618 FPS average would be
4.7 gigahertz version performing at 132
FPS average that's roughly a 23% climb
in stock to stock performance we skip
Ivy Bridge here and jump to Devil's
Canyon 4790k for the i7 operating at 140
FPS average the i7 6700 K is at 141 FPS
average and the 7700 K is at 146 FPS
average part of the reason for our new
tests is this one we're bumping into
other limits here clearly so we'll soon
be moving on to the new GPU and new
games in our legacy watchdogs to test
the 8700 K performed nearly the same as
the 7700 K held back in some ways by the
more limited boost clock we noticed that
our gigabyte
or too often only turbos to 4.4
gigahertz on the Z 370 board for all
core turbo during gaming scenarios this
is 100 megahertz lower than the 7700 k's
all core turbo and is sometimes
reflected in games by a slight frame
deficit that said this is a legacy test
and we'll see if that changes for the
new one
despite the increased core count Intel
here is facing a similar scenario to AMD
with Rison they have heavily
multi-threaded capable CPUs but they're
facing adoption challenges on the gaming
front in the future now that both
vendors are pushing for higher thread
count it'll happen but four games out
today some will benefit from threads and
somewhat better benefit from speed we've
been told that some of the Asus boards
boost to 4.7 gigahertz all core in stock
settings which would net a higher fps
let's move on to the new game tests
which use all the new testing
methodology that we've kind of already
pointed out but is also in the article
linked in description below along with
extra charts for games that won't be
shown here starting with Civilization
six we used the AI benchmark to test a
different metric time required to
compute AI turns as FPS is rather
useless here the turn time is about the
same at 1440p as it is at 1080p that we
did test both average FPS actually goes
up for worse CPUs because the time spent
idling on the screen is longer so just
to reiterate that and make sure it gets
through the reason we're not using FPS
as a metric for the AI benchmark is
because as you plot it with worse and
worse CPUs FPS goes up why does that
happen it happens because in an AI
benchmark where you're testing turn time
a longer turn means more time spent
staring at these same non moving
elements on the screen whereas a faster
CPU is going to jump around two points
on the map
a lot more frequently and will fit in
the times benchmark more so that means
the FPS will be worse on those hence
we're not including FPS benchmarks
because there's no point sims not really
a game where you do that so back to the
x then the 5 gigahertz overclocked to i7
8700 k holds the fastest average turn
time at about fifteen point four to
fifteen point five seconds
per turn to give an idea for range this
is a twenty six point six percent
reduction from the slowest time although
a five second average turn time is not
huge keep in mind that this is per turn
so a five player game would benefit from
a 25 second reduction in total time per
total turn to get to your next turn
across the lawn play periods this can
add up but the relevance of it is really
up to you
anyway the 8,700 case stocks CPU
completes its turns in about 16.1
seconds or about 4% slower than the
overclock the 7700 case the oxy View
completes its turns in sixteen point
five seconds with the four point one
Giga at 1600 X not far behind as you can
tell by looking at the 1600 X stock and
OC numbers B 1700 stock and OC numbers
and the 8700 ka stock ANOVA see numbers
frequency matters in this game to a
point that's perhaps greater than thread
the 7700 cavers is 87 100k it also
indicates that frequency is of at least
slightly more important than the thread
count for total Wars a new benchmark we
measured the 8700 K is a chart topper at
1080p with 176 FPS average and lows at
110 and 95 fps we experienced a
bottleneck at 1080p with the overclocked
not providing any additional performance
versus stocks or stuck at the GPU here
the 7700 K is 7.4 percent slower at 163
FPS average with the r5 1600 X at 4.1
gigahertz running a 147 FPS average and
is 16% slower than the 8700 K Total War
favors the frequency advantage of the
1600 x over the stock 1700 clearly at
1440p we equalize some of the distance
with GP limitations but still see
differences I 780 700 K is clearly still
bottleneck on the GPU operating a now
reduced 153 FPS average for each skew
this is 7700 K runs at 143 or 7% behind
and the stock r7 1600 X runs 20% behind
the 8700 K as shown here project cars at
1080p has the 5 gigahertz 8700 K at 127
FPS average benefiting from the
frequency focus of the game the 4.4
gigahertz all core operating frequency
condemns the 8700 K to perform about the
same as the 4.5 gigahertz 7
100 K and our testing both that around
108 to 110 F he has average are 7 1700
further demonstrates the frequency focus
of this game plays in at 78 point 5 fps
stock but 87 FPS at 4 gigahertz
the result is a staggering 45%
difference for the 5 gigahertz 8700 K
versus the 4 gigahertz 1700 or 43%
versus the 4.1 Giga at 1600 X stock to
stock the different strengths to 27%
versus the higher clock 1600 X at 1440p
the 8700 K manages 118 FPS average
overclocked 106 fps stock and with our
all core 100 megahertz deficit to the
7700 K producing the expected favored 4
KB lake Rison performance remains more
or less exactly where it was for the
1080p results as a result of being CPU
bottlenecked we have a few more game
benchmarks in the article linked below
if you want GTA 5 and some others it'll
be there but this video is getting
pretty long at this point so we'll leave
them to the article get into some
production workloads now we'll start
with our legacy blender test using two
point seven eight a then move to the
updated renders on two point seven nine
like the game in section we're doing
this to give an idea for scaling against
a year's worth of CPUs but also to
provide important modernized information
with a more limited data set with
version 2.7 8 a and our in-house monkey
heads render the 8,700 case stock CPU
takes twenty three point seven minutes
to complete the render which is about a
44% time reduction from the 7700 K a
stock CPUs 42-minute under time compared
to r7 CPU is the 8700 K takes about 11
to 13 percent less time to render them
the 3.9 gigahertz overclocked r7 cpus
including the 1700 x @ 3.9 gigahertz and
3466 maegor's memory speed the 8700 k
takes 28% less time to render than the
r7 1700 and that's thanks to its high
frequency and core account combination
for the performance turns out intel also
has version 2.7 8a to thank for version
2.7 9 we're using the test shown on the
screen now the monkeyhead render takes
twenty six point six minutes to render
on the 8700 k compared to twenty eight
point eight minutes on the 1700 both
with 32 hundred megahertz CL 16 memory
8700 k completes the monkeyhead render
seven point six percent faster than the
r7 17
and that closes the gap in this case
overclocking both produces a twenty four
point one five-minute render on the 8700
k or twenty four point seven minutes on
these 1704 Adobe Premiere and other
benchmarks not shown here check the
article linked in the description below
I'm gonna leave it there you've got
enough data to really piece together
your own conclusion at this point I
don't need to spend five more minutes
talking about it
the only commentary I have to offer
right now is pricing and availability we
know that Hamas RP is we don't know what
it's gonna cost when it launches because
we film this before it's available on
retail so if the price is MSRP the 8700
K definitely has a place in the
environment for the right users
apparently there are power delivery
optimizations on Z 370 it would still be
nice to see the CPU work on Z 270 but it
might not be that simple
and until frankly we won't tell us
anything further than what we already
know as for Z 390 that is supposed to
carry a performance improvements Z 370
is somewhat of a stopgap between now and
Z 390 and Intel clearly move this launch
a little bit forward to better compete
because they just launched cable a
commit 7700 K in January so if you
already own something like a 77 heart k
unless you have a very specific reason
for this 80 a 700 K I'd say don't
upgrade but for older CPUs obviously
there are reasons to upgrade to either
Rison we're Intel at this point you've
got a whole list of data pick through it
find your use case and decide from there
because it's very use case dependent at
this point I'm not going to put a
blanket statement on it if you should
buy it or not availability in some
regions will allegedly be low but we're
just not sure yet those are still rumors
so if it's low I'm sure I'll be
complaining about it in an episode soon
enough so subscribe for that if it
happens otherwise the i-5 review comes
shortly this was enough for now
patreon.com/scishow us before this is
what we do so help us out if you like it
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
