our new CPU testing methodology for this
year we already shared some of the
workstation benchmarks which are
actually getting further updating after
that and now we're looking at the gaming
benchmarks for what we're working with
into 2019 and the upcoming rise in 3,000
CPU launch so this is our first round of
tests for this testing method and it
includes a good range an eclectic mix of
CPUs if you will before that this video
is brought to you by thermal grizzly and
their high end thermal compounds thermal
grizzly makes cryo not paste for high
thermal performance and conductivity
without being electrically conductive so
you don't have to worry about shorting
components cryo knot is particularly
good for replacing stock GPU pastes as
cryo knot is a non curing compound learn
more at the link in the description
below so a couple things here first of
all the article below will have some
additional testing methodology
information if you are curious about the
specific game settings used versions of
various software solutions things like
that and the workstation benchmark was
already published if you're curious
about Adobe Premiere Photoshop
WinZip things like or 7-zip rather
software solutions like that
we're tested previously we are as a note
adding an additional compile test and
we're working with some of our community
members on figuring out the best type of
tests to do for this so we did GCC with
cygwin and that showed AMD doing really
well but there are other types of
compiling where Intel does really well
and they're both valid they're just
looking at different aspects of the
processor so our next step is to iterate
on that and add another program compile
test and then we'll have one showing the
use case where AMD excels in one show in
the use case we're Intel excels and then
the programmers a money you can pick
which one is most applicable to your use
case so that should be pretty cool but
that's getting worked on separately
today we're looking at games and we've
added several games we aside from
increasing the count of games we also
are now doing across all of them except
for mostly one to resolution so 1080 and
1440 across the whole stack which
obviously doubles the testing load but
allows us to see at what point the GP
bottleneck becomes a limiter and how
relevant the different gaps between CPUs
are at ten
P if you're planning to do a
higher-resolution that might become GPU
about so that's part of we're looking at
and then we have the test bench in the
description below and the methodology in
the description below as well in that
article finally as for the CPUs chosen
we just we kind of picked a bunch of
ones that would allow us to validate the
methods so the goal was to get a wide
range on the stack where we have some
common ones twenty-seven hundred ninety
nine hundred K things like that that a
couple that were a bit more sprawled out
in terms of the performance differences
so that we could determine if the
testing was a good valid and reliable
and repeatable method going forward so
we will be adding more CPUs of course
but this is just the first preview of
what we're doing for testing with games
for 2019 so let's get straight into the
data little talk conclusions at the end
the total war Warhammer to battle
benchmark is basically the same thing as
the total war Warhammer one test we ran
in our previous methodology just using a
different scene and with different
armies the same problems with
inconsistent 1% and 0.1% low is it from
the first total Warhammer game effects
this one as well but the overall FPS
averages are still reliable the high
preset is also still used as with the
other games coming up the overclocked in
9900 K is the stuff the top scorer with
slightly lower clocked at 9,700 K
benchmarks trailing by an insignificant
margin average FPS of the 5.1 gigahertz
overclocked 9700 K is only 3 FPS beyond
that only 5 gigahertz overclocked 6 core
6 thread 8600 k implying that here again
as a game that doesn't much benefit from
more than 6 threads and instead becomes
more focused on higher frequencies this
is a game that strongly benefits from
the 2990 W X's game mode which brings
the FPS average up from nineteen point
five to 121 that's still worse than the
other CPUs we've tested but at least
it's not broken Corp Ryo appears to
slightly raise performance as well but
nowhere near as much as simply turning
off cores with game mode here's where it
gets interesting if you're looking at
the stock r5 2600 9x results of 133 FPS
average versus the stock r7 2700 results
of 123 FPS average you might wonder
about why that happened we'd already
know that
scam likes frequency more than threads
so we can take a look at the frequency
over time when this benchmark is running
in this chart we ran the test on the
2600 versus the 2700 both stock and
logged the frequency on each core during
the test as illustrated by the chart the
r5 2600 maintains a much higher
frequency of 38 16 megahertz to 38 50
megahertz all core something that we can
see plotted against all six core clocks
in this chart the r7 2700 runs it closer
to the 3467 megahertz all core range
although we like recommending the r7
2700 9x it's normally under the
stipulation of a user applied overclock
and this is part of why there's still a
lot of all core Headroom to gain here
but this illustrates exactly why the our
727-100 gets outmatched by the cheaper
r5 2600 in frequency bound titles fps it
lowered for every CPU tested when the
resolution was raised to 1440p so we're
starting to encounter GP bottlenecking
at this new resolution this is sort of
the point with the 1440p test though as
it's a degree of realism that can
sometimes be lost at 1080p if you were
to run these graphics settings on a 20
atti with this game the choice between
an 8700 k 9700 k 9900 k or really
anything above the 2600 at 4.2 gigahertz
would be largely irrelevant they're all
about the same the top half of the
results that be the I 580 600 K through
the i7 8700 K are all within margin of
error if you're confused why the 8700 K
is quote-unquote better than the 9900 K
don't be it's not it's just that the
results are within error margins and
test variance and so we can either
distinguish nor realize the actual
differences between these processors
there are some differences in point one
percent one percent low values
Illustrated primarily in the overclocked
stat 9900 K 9700 8600 K but that's about
the only difference these are all beyond
the cutoff for GPU bottlenecking
but below that level there's still some
differentiation between the CPUs the 4.2
gigahertz 2700 and stock 2700 X are neck
and neck again proving the value of
AMD's non X CPU and overclocked
the stock twenty six hundred and twenty
six hundred
but the 2600 X does have slightly better
one percent lows the 1440
test doesn't provide much value beyond
reminding us that GPA limitations can
limit cpu differentiation when playing
at higher settings the baked in total
war Warhammer to campaign benchmark is
much more CPU bound than the battle
benchmark which is a good thing given
the obvious GPU limitations of the 1440p
battle benchmark the overclocked to 9900
K and 97 hard K lead in the 1080p test
as well which makes sense the results
should and do line up nearly the same as
they do in the battle benchmark but with
more differentiation at the high end
overclocked in the 9900 K to 5 point 2
gigahertz gives a boost of about 6% over
the Sox 9900 K with the 9700 K
overclocked receiving a boost of 7%
frame times are reasonable across most
of the chart although there's still some
natural run to run variance that builds
a bigger error bar in the 0.1% lo
category as for other rankings the 8600
KF 5 gigahertz surpasses the stock 97 RK
and stock 87 RK which is a clear
illustration that total war Warhammer is
still heavily dependent upon frequency
of each part this is further illustrated
with the differentiation between the r7
2,700 x stock CPU plotting 135 FPS
average and the r5 2600 xcp you plot a
note 135 FPS average as well when stock
the extra cores don't matter much here
but the frequency ties things up the
2990 WX does terribly here predictably
as the game doesn't quite understand
what to do with the threads and
scheduling get screwy and memory latency
causes delays Corp Ryo doesn't fix
anything either but restarting it's a
game mode to disable half the cores does
boost the 2990 W XOR seven 2700 levels
of performance unlike the battle
benchmarks the campaign benchmark at
1440p shows some scaling right up to the
overclocked 9900 K and 9700 K where we
do start to see some clipping off of the
high end the higher scoring CPUs do have
lower averages than they did at 1080p
though so they are approaching a GPU
limit a lot of rise and results are
within margin of error like B 2600 at
4.2 gigahertz the 2700 X stock and the
2600 X stock f1 2018 is another
returning title with the methodology
unchanged for the last round except for
newer drivers and a newer version of
Windows both of which impacts the
results the frame rates at 1080p and
1440p are high they're far beyond 144
Hertz monitors if you're trying to
achieve that but there still see be
limited so it's a good test of relative
performance
the overclocked to 9900 k97 Hut ceilidh
at over 300 FPS average with their stock
scores following it right behind the
9900 case stock in 9700 KOC results are
roughly within margin of error of each
other and our outside of our test
resolution as it is now the chart has a
clean intel AMD split with the typically
higher frequency intel parts at the top
and the typically higher thread count
and d parts at the bottom there are 720
700 X runs at about 236 FPS average
ranking it as functionally equals the
overclocked 2700 at 4.2 gigahertz a
surprise as they're about the same
frequency here the r5 2600 X oxy vo ends
up at 224 FPS average allowing the
overclocks 2700 elite of about 5% it's
clear that Intel is enabling higher
overall framerate here with its high in
two parts I'll be it more expensive on
average but we are entering into
territory where the question of
practical versus theoretical differences
emerges the relatively low frequency
2990 WX performed worst of all behind
the stock 2,600 2,700 but this is
expected for threader for parts in
gaming scenarios the 2600 and 2700 end
up in the same order as total war
Warhammer which is the result of higher
frequency on the stock 2600 when under
all core workloads let's look at a frame
time plot to better illustrate the
differences as a reminder frame time
plots given up close look to frame to
frame creation time showing how many
milliseconds it takes to draw each
frames of the screen this is an
important metric that can get obfuscated
with average frame rates even 1% lows
and helps illustrate consistency of
frame delivery so 9700 K and 2,700 X
both encounter occasional hiccups beyond
12 milliseconds but these are rare and
unnoticeable in single frame doses the
user would not notice these because
they're not a big enough excursion to
really be seen the 23 millisecond spike
is getting more noticeable but the
excursions to 9 to 12 milliseconds don't
become particularly visible to the user
unless several spikes happen in sequence
which they don't hear overall both of
these CPUs handle the game with fluidity
going to 1440p the increased resolution
knocks the Peaks off of the frame rates
with some GPU limitation but only the
9700 K 9900 K and overclocked 8600 K
have reached the level where noticeable
CPU scaling stops so r7 2700 at 4.2
gigahertz and 2,700 X are within margin
of error of each other and are also not
too distant from the stock 8700 K which
otherwise leading the pack of CPUs that
are only occasionally hitting GPU
limitations the r7 2700 stock CPU
doesn't look great here comparatively
but keep in mind that we're still at
about 200 FPS in this title the point
though is that it is limiting a 20 atti
at 1440p although this bottleneck should
further diminish as resolution increases
the 2700 deserves an overclock as we've
always said as its performance climbs
notably to 220 FPS average when pushed
to 4.2 gigahertz all core Assassin's
Creed origins is next this is our most
troublesome benchmark because of
occasional stuttering that we have to
correct for with extra bench passes but
it's a good example of a game that
respond strongly to overclocking similar
in behavior to hitman 2 settings remain
at the medium preset unchanged from
previous testing the top 4 CPUs are
nearly tied at 1080p approaching a
definite GPU bottleneck and making this
one of the games that will need to
replace a revamp for our next round of
testing still the overclocked to 9900 K
and 9700 K hold a slight performance
lead over stock the 8700 K stock is tied
with 8600 K when clock to 5 gigahertz so
we can say that origins that seems to
benefit from higher thread counts
interestingly the 2990 WX results
confirm this
even though the game suffered from
hitching to the point of being
unplayable average frame rate was
slightly higher at stock than it was in
game mode even though game mode didn't
have stuttering and pulling the average
down this is also a study in why we test
with 1% lowest part one protect lures
and frame time plots because these
deficits in thread refers creator mode
would not be shown if only looking at
average FPS and last place was the stock
R 5 2600 which performed up much better
with a 4.2 gigahertz overclock and again
further confirms that threads are
helping here otherwise it'd be faster
than the stock r7 2700 raising the
resolution makes the GPU bottleneck more
prevalent but there's enough fluctuation
in framerate during the test at 1440p
that it's still really only the top 4
CPUs that have hit the wall the 9700 K
and 9900 K have a 1 FPS range between
them which is well within test variants
for this title the 87 arcade overclocked
280 600 K you have swap the leads but
remain nearly tied as I have the 2700
stock and overclocked 2600 and the rest
of the stack is ordered the same as it
was at 1080 the same itching issues
plagued the 2990 WX unless game mode is
enabled which again slightly lowers the
average FPS GTA 5 returns with almost
identical settings to our previous tests
but with high detail streaming while
flying is enabled an extended distance
scaling maxed out the segments of the
built in benchmark that we logged for
testing was too often hitting the 180
7.5 FPS engine limit on modern CPUs and
these tweaks are intended to make it
more stressful by increasing draw calls
that the CPU has to juggle for increased
geometry drawing GTA 5 is the oldest
game we use receive you testing by a
longshot and at some point it will need
to be phased out at 1080p that
overclocked 5.2 gigahertz 9900 Kay
predictably leads the way trailed just
slightly by the 5.1 gigahertz 9700 K
again there's no tangible benefit from
having more than eight threads in this
title in fact given how close the stock
8600 K and 8700 K scores are it's
unlikely that there's much benefit from
having more than six as we fill out the
chart with older four and six thread
CPUs the answer will become more clear
although that said we've seen in the
past that having four threads or six
threads can be detrimental if you're
trying to hit that maximum frame rate
limit because once you start hitting 180
7.5 and GTA 5 something like an i5 CPU
without hyper threading will begin to
hitch in a very noticeable fashion
something we've published in the past
the 2700 trails at roughly the same
level as the 2990 WX which doesn't
significantly benefit from game mode or
Corp ryo outside of potentially more
stable as your one-percent lows other
than that i'm dolls law applies and GTA
v favors frequency with threads
preferred only to a point
there's a clear division in this chart
between Intel and AMD with and the
falling universally below 100 FPS
average which we saw in our last round
of GTA 5 tests as well despite light
lighter settings and so we can
illustrate gaming advantages and Intel
CPUs for this benchmark sometimes to the
tune of 20% uplift as for the 9700 stock
in 9,900 case stock will again remind
you that these results are within margin
of error at 1440p GPU limitations keep
results at the high end of the chart
squished closer together note that for
the lower performance CPUs the scores
are practically unchanged at either
resolution while the 9900 KOC drops
fully ten fps
the partial GP bottleneck the stock 1900
km 97 or k have technically swapped
places on the charge but the two stock
CPUs perform essentially identically to
each other at both 1080p and 1440p and
remain within error margins the 2600 K
and 2600 are also close to each other
and the 0.1% lows of the 2990 WX are
again slightly worse at stock than they
were are with Corp Rio shadow of the
Tomb Raider gives us a DirectX 12
representation the medium preset is used
for this one the 1080p result shows a
decent balance between thread count and
frequency being the deciding factor of
performance the overclocked to 9900 K
still tops the chart but the stock and
Corp Ryo enabled 2990 WX results are
significantly higher than the game mode
results and for once the 2990 WX exceeds
both e stock 2700 and stock 2600 in
performance the six core six thread 8600
k place is fairly high but the 4.2
gigahertz 2,700 plays better than the
4.2 gigahertz 2600 again confirming that
Shadow the Tomb Raider is actually
benefiting from thread count at least as
high as 16 the 97 hardcase stock CPU
ends up about 24% hired frame rate than
the r7 2700 X 4 point of reference as
1440p we cut that test from this batch
we discovered that it was GPU bound
almost all the way down the stack and so
there's no value in illustrating the
same number of 15 different times
civilization 6 updated and replaced its
AI benchmark in the middle of redoing
our tests again so we have fewer results
for this title as of right now the new
test is still 4 passes with 5 turns per
pass but each turn is significantly
longer and should magnify the
differences between CPUs as CPU
intensive as it is the AI benchmark
doesn't make great use of higher thread
counts this game like many others likes
frequency the stock 2990 WX resolves
turns faster than it did in game mode
but not by much the only overclocked CPU
we've run in civilization so far is the
80 600 K since we had to throw out our
original set of data and the increase in
frequency allowed it to surpass the
other 12 16 and 64 thread CPUs at 30
seconds to complete a turn a full pass
with 5 players would take 2.5 minutes
that starts getting noticeable
the slowdown from the 8600 k2 the 2700 X
36 second time when you're comparing to
risky overclocked 8600 k is is pretty
big that's another 30 seconds you'd be
waiting for your next turn we'll revisit
this test and add more CPUs as we go as
six updates enough that it wipes all of
our data out at least once a year we use
the Miami bench scene for hitman to our
next game the important settings for CPU
testing our max LOD and Max simulation
quality even with relatively high GP
related settings CPUs have remained the
bottleneck in our testing so far the
overclocks 5.1 gigahertz 9700 k leads
the pack although we need to run the
9900 KOC through here it's clear from
the other results like the 2600 OC
versus the 2700 OC that this title
doesn't benefit much from thread counts
greater than 8 the lowest scoring game
CPU or sort of mainstream CPU was the r7
2700 thanks to its lower all core
frequency than the r5 2600 wily 2990 WX
scored lowest of all with no significant
difference from either switching to game
mode or running Corp Ryo for the
services the results stack is exactly
the same at 1080p or 1440p testing the
8700 K overclocked to a comparable
frequency and seeing if it scores lower
than the 9700 K as well as next on our
to-do list
the 2990 WX chugs Alon in last place
again at 1440p with no uplift from game
mode this would indicate again that it's
because of just too many cores and
threads and not enough frequency so
that's it for this one as you can see
we've added a few games and we're pretty
happy with the games we have so far sip
6 frustratingly changed in a very
substantial way in the middle of our
testing so we had a full suite of test
run with sub 6 and then it updated and
the turn time changed again so the good
news is that the update extended the
turn duration for the benchmark so we
end up with something that can better
show the differences between CPUs where
previously you might see a 1 second
difference and that's kind of like ok
whatever but what do you see a
six-second difference or 10 second
difference multiplied across however
many AI players you have that starts to
become significant and as many of you
turn based
strategy game players know the more AI
you add the more that wait time really
starts to pile on as you uncover more of
the map and it get further in the game
so that's changed and we've adopted the
newest version of Civ 6-4 for the
benchmark we think it's more accurate
we've added more to total war so anyway
there's a lot more we can do here and
we're working on it so keep keep your
eyes peeled for future content including
especially the upcoming modified version
of our compiler benchmark where we'll
have the one that we already ran plus a
new one showing when Intel pulls ahead
in theory anyway so that's all coming up
stay subscribed for that or get
subscribed if you're not you can go to
store like here in Texas net to pick up
a mod mat they are now back in stock
finally so we have the medium mod mats
as on the table here and the large mod
mat as under it both on store documents
Nexus dotnet if you order them they'll
go out right away
so thank you for watching I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
