GN and this is the series where if you
have questions about hardware technology
news whatever post them below will try
to get to it for the next video this one
we're doing in the middle of a
thunderstorm so i apologize if there's
some background noise while i'm talking
here but let's get into the first
question is from Lucretia's 22 much for
that name disgusts me or not is there
any point to changing the core clock of
a modern GPU for overclocking as opposed
to just increasing the power target and
or temperature limit since with GPU
boost the card will overclock as far as
it can anyway the short answer to this
is yes depends on what you're doing so
for the RX 480 as an example we tested
this where because the if you just
increase the power target it still got a
range so it's saying I'm going to stay
between X megahertz and why megahertz
where x and y might be something like of
top of my head out I think 12 1100 1200
to 1300 almost depend on what kind of
offset you configure but it's got a
range and so we just increase the power
target and don't touch anything else on
something like the RX 480 what will
happen is it'll push as high as it can
when it can and then when it feels as if
some sort of thermal threshold is being
hit it'll throttle back and so you lose
some frames there you potentially
introduce some low one percent or point
one percent low frame rates which
impacts your frame times which creates
stuttering so the way to avoid that
would be to go in there and also
configure a higher fan speed or fan
speed curve or manually configure the
clock rate and set it to be something
more stable and consistent or restrict
the range of that clock rate so that's
one reason on nvidia cards like the gtx
1080 it's a similar answer they had that
voltage frequency curve these days that
was new with boost through point O boost
through point O and and these newest
version of boosts are both pretty
complex in the way they function versus
previously but increase in the power
target certainly will do a bit for you
it'll sustain the high end of the
configured clock rate
we're longer depending on because it
also increases the temperature limited
step so it increases the two together so
by increasing the temperature limit in
the power target limit you're moving or
reducing some mitigating factors two
variables that could throttle back the
clock rate so you'll sustain a higher
overall clock but you'll get a bit just
from doing the percentage offset I would
recommend manually overclocking in
general just as good practice because
you'll get more out of it and you can
kind of fine tune where the limits are
next question is from at CBU Sybil you
four days ago who says not sure if you
will know much about this but here's a
question with doing a more budget system
for cad type software ptc creo
specifically would you recommend buying
the cheaper geforce card or with the
cheaper geforce card be fine compared to
getting a quadro card the projects right
now our small mechanical parts so
something like CAD computer-aided design
or drafting I'm not an expert in but I
can give you some advice based on
personal experience with it to some
extent with CAD software and with render
software like premier or if you're
working with solidworks blender anything
like that one thing you'll want to check
is first of all is the software khuda
aur opencl accelerated to open CL and
and it's supported well then AMD cards
can work pretty well with it if it's
CUDA accelerated then obviously you go
nvidia and you fir for professional or
production use cases you really want to
buy your card based on what your
software will support in terms of
acceleration on the GPU on the hardware
side so you don't want to push all that
on the cpu so by your card based on that
if it's good at let's say it's cuda
accelerated i don't know if that's the
case for ptc creo specifically but if
it's cuda accelerated you're buying an
nvidia card if it's opencl maybe
consider am diva nvidia card quadro may
quadro will work but it's always going
to be more expensive than geforce car
which i guess is where the passion comes
from so as an example for adobe premiere
we use geforce cards
and even though quadra would kind of
work a bit better the price offset isn't
worth it to us so we just use g4s you
can even use multiple of them if you
want if the software supports multi-gpu
it doesn't need to be at over an SLI
bridge just multi-gpu MDA so GeForce can
be as good or comparable to quadro but
you'll want to check will the software
specifically support g-force and then
look around for benchmarks online
unfortunately mountain expert in that
area one thing i will say for adobe
software in the past we've had to go
into txt files and configuration files
and add the card that we're using so for
example in cs5 you have to go into a txt
file add in geforce gtx 980 or 780 or
whatever and at that point it will use
that card for acceleration up until that
point it would only detect and use
certain quadro cards so you may have to
change your software's configuration
files to specifically detect and call a
GTX card and obviously the psalter needs
to support that at some level as well so
basically the answer is the unfortunate
you're gonna have to do some more
research but GTX can work as well or
close enough to a quadro card and
performance where it may be worth buying
just because it's cheaper especially if
it supports multi-gpu next question is
from Miguel Felix who says so I'm
curious how much of an improvement can
you expect from each release of drivers
from nvidia or Andy would it be
noticeable in terms of FPS yes it would
be noticeable in terms of FPS we have
tested some of this a good example that
we tested recently as published was when
doom came out before Vulcan doom came
out with OpenGL only and the AMD r9 390
X we tested had pretty bad performance I
think it was comparable to a gtx 960
which should never be the case and so
Andy push drivers that improved
performance so much i think it was
twenty-five or thirty percent
performance increase in FPS so it
improved it so much that it outpaced the
960 and i think going from memory was
tied close to whatever with the nine
70 so you can definitely expect bigger
improvements than a zero FPS noticeable
gain depends on the driver update
depends on the game so a driver update
doesn't just do a blanket to increase in
performance for all games it will
specifically target certain games target
elements of that game whether it's post
FX processing or texture or batch
processing or whatever whatever the game
is doing in both AMD and NVIDIA will
tune for that that game specifically and
then you get a performance improvement
there's no real general you can expect X
percent but I've seen as much as thirty
percent and I've seen as low as one
percent so definitely arrange next
question is Alice star says about these
aio GPUs that's all in one for those who
don't know with liquid cooler about
these aio GPS I've experienced issues
with an aio cpu cooler which need topped
up after only six months due to air
bubbles getting caught in the pump what
is the end causing noise what is the
situation if this needs to be done with
one of these aio GPUs that don't have a
fill port so that's correct these
generally an aio by a sort of nature of
what it is an all-in-one it will not
have a fill port it's not meant really
to be an open loop system that you're
filling and maintaining its supposed to
be easily deployable you use it for like
five years and then you throw it out and
get something else with your new
computer so they are not meant to be
refilled that does mean that they have
some advantages over open loops one is
time to is price there's a big ones but
they also have a biocide in them which I
figure what it is on top of my head but
they would biocide in them and that that
helps make sure there's no bacteria
buildup which you will sometimes get in
open loops if you don't also put some of
that chemical n would you can buy from
Lowe's or something but so that's those
are the advantages now in terms of
topping them off you can't do that with
these a iOS but you shouldn't need to
the only reason you get air bubbles with
noise that I can think of as on a
consistent basis would be if you install
the
radiator upside down so the recommended
installation for almost all radiators
I've ever worked with let's say you're
you've got a case here and I've actually
got one here so we just built this for
that video that was countering the
motherboard article and if you mount
your radiator in the back of the case
and the rear fan spot what's going on
then basically you get what's in this
case here so you see I have the tubes
down here that's where you want them if
you install this with the tubes at the
top of a rear-mounted or vertical
radiator front-mounted tubes at the top
can it makes the pump work harder the
pump is not pulling the the liquid down
and that can cause air to enter the sort
of the system and we talked to rob
teller from a stack about this but it's
real problem causes air bubbles and that
can create the noise you're talking
about so just install it correctly and
it shouldn't really be a problem next
question is from Ramos arena skin of
Rome who says serious question i'm
hearing the I've heard that before i'm
hearing the 490 might be 24 80s and one
card is that possible if so it doesn't
really fix the crossfire issue of old
games not using multiple GPUs so what's
the point so the first question is it
possible yes you can definitely put two
gps on one card and it's been done
several times some of the old nvidia 90
series so i think the 690 maybe was one
of them recently 590 those were two GPU
cards as two GPUs on one PCB and then
they share the ram or they have two
separate i should say separate stacks of
ram so it might be labeled as for
example and they did this and they did
this with the fire pro might be label
that's like 12 or 16 gigabytes of erm
but it's still independent effectively
banks for each GPU but yeah it's
possible and then the next question was
doesn't fix the crossfire issue
the issues you have with crossfire or
sli you will pretty much also have with
a dual GPU single card because it's
still going to behave the same that
needs to be tasked independently or
correctly by the developers of the game
anything that's got interdependent
frames like post effects and things like
that will be more difficult for sli and
crossfire configurations to resolve and
that includes multi-gpu single cards as
for the 490 specifically I honestly
haven't looked at any rumors I don't
know anything about what it's supposed
to be but if it is to RX for 80s then
that would basically just be two of the
Al's matter chips on a single card which
andy has done in the past and it's
normally been in the 90 series so that
seems like a reasonable potential
assumption and it would be more powerful
you would get the same performance if
you look at our our X 480 crossfire
benchmark it would be almost the same
performance with one potential change to
that a potential change would be you're
forcing a lot more data potentially
through the PCIe slot so when you're
pushing all this extra base because your
dual processing you're doing AFR so it's
one frame per GPU so that's more in
theory double the the frame output from
a single card not necessarily how it
works in real life but that's the idea
so when you increase the bandwidth and
push it all through one port there is a
chance that you lose some performance as
opposed to two RX for 80s that have the
exact same clock right and everything in
crossfire so keep that in mind but with
a dual GPU single card normally there's
either a price benefits or you can just
get two of them and now you have four
cards that only take two slots so that's
okay i guess the pen what you're trying
to do hopefully that answers that but
