nexus tonight and i am joined by Nick
Pinkerton we just finished our first day
at pax prime 2013 where we were on the
show floor all day and I spoke to a
couple of hardware companies Nick spoke
to a couple game companies so nick is
going to be starting us off with the
wolf among us then we're going into
Wolfenstein a little bit of lords of the
fallen and then I'll follow it up with
intel SSD overclocking which is a brand
new thing and cooler master's half
stacker so Nick what can you tell us
about the wolf among us well the wolf
among this is from Telltale Games the
same developers that made the walking
dead and there are actually a couple
elements that they borrowed over from
the walking dead like the dialogue there
are multiple options in the dialogue
wheel you can even choose silence as an
option and there are a lot of reactions
that that these characters will have
during that series and and the variety
in those interactions is pretty crazy so
they've basically just taken that to the
next level they also let you act out
combat situations or combat scenes by
choosing different objects in the
environment to interact with and so
basically there's a lot more variety in
those scenes so it's really taking the
walking dead bring it to a new level and
really putting it in a noir setting that
kind of reminds me of sin city the the
comic book or the film and just putting
this beautiful like neon coat of paint
on top of that so that's going to be a
lot of fun to play it comes out later
this fall and then I also went by the
Bethesda booth to talk with some people
about Wolfenstein the new order so
that's a Wolfenstein shooter where
you're running around and kinda like
post World War two europe and really i
didn't think that the the World War 2
setting was was anything that we hadn't
seen before but it was really cool to
see that on a more current gen engine if
maybe played the games like like rage or
the fallout game so you're familiar with
what Bethesda can do from like a visual
standpoint so I mean that's definitely
still worth checking out and there are a
lot of new like mex and technologies
that kind of come later in the game as
you get later into
the stages and lastly Lords of the
Fallen if you like Dark Souls that's
definitely a game to keep on your radar
the executive producer he was the one
doing the demo presentation the guys
worked on The Witcher 2 he's worked on
Skyrim and kingdoms of amalur so i'm
pretty sure that this is going to be a
game that we want to follow in the
future very cool and as far as the
hardware front for the hardware
enthusiast out there intel SSD
overclocking is a sort of new thing they
have a utility coming out it's all
software driven you can overclock the
asic you can overclock the the actual
frequency of the bus and that improves
the speed from what we saw at least a
couple you know like fifteen percent or
twenty percent in the least and that's
ideally useful for when you're writing a
large video files because that's that's
hammer in your eye oh so that's your
biggest bottleneck we're actually doing
a full video on that tomorrow so check
the site for our interview with Intel's
SSD engineers and the overclocking lab
where we'll show you how it works and
how you can do it the cooler master half
stacker is the other item I wanted to
talk about there's two full videos on
that and an article already on the site
the half stacker is actually a fully
modular enclosure so it is a it's a full
tower enthusiast solution that can
actually stack multiple mini cases on
top of each other and that's an endless
until you hit a weight limit obviously
so you just stack the rails it comes
with comes with one of their module
boxes if you pay 170 dollars you get the
module box and the full half 925 mid
tower solution and then you can purchase
additional mini-itx form factor boxes
each one of those can either fit another
machine or it can fit two three sixty
millimeter radiators each so if you
bought two of them you could put four
and that's obviously ideal for
enthusiasts building a custom liquid
loop and check the full article for that
if it interests you you're looking at
video footage of it right now so that's
it for the first day of pax prime for us
check back again tomorrow for our Intel
footage for more of our lords of the
fallen we'll be up by then and then
we're also checking out a game called
shadow warrior shadow warrior yes with
lo with lo Wang
move in so check that out and we'll see
you guys next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
