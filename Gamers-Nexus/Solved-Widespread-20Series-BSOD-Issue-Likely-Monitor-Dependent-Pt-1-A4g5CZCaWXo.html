involves several monitors we've had more
in here and a stack of video cards we
have an update on the first round of
dead
in quotes RT x 28 ET is the reason
that's in quotes is because some of them
are legitimately experiencing some kind
of hardware level issue and then some
are BS or these software issues CTD
scratches desktop things like that so
this is the first half or so of the
cards that we actually not even that
that we have coming in these the ones
that got in today ran some validation on
a few of them already some have definite
either BIOS or hardware level issues
talk about those separately and some
that are just BSO DS really bad ones
though we've been able to reproduce but
it's very difficult to do so so we're me
talking about specifically the Nvidia
BSOD issue the blue screen of death on
the twenty series cards for today before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal grizzly and their high-end
thermal compounds thermal grizzly makes
cryo not paste for high thermal
performance and conductivity without
being electrically conductive so you
don't have to worry about shorting
components
Crona is particularly good for replacing
stock GPU pastes as cryo not is a non
curing compound learn more at the link
in the description below so this one is
really pretty simple the blue screen of
death if you're not seeing artifact and
you're not seeing frequency locks like
the 1300 megahertz which we do see on
one card and all you're seeing is a blue
screen of death that happens seemingly
sporadically it happens almost
definitely when you play games maybe
within the first hour it is typically
associated with high refresh monitors or
with g-sync this one we've been able to
reproduce like once or twice and that's
kind of it it's really difficult to
recreate the issue without everyone's
exact hardware configuration but in
reproducing the issue a couple of times
and talking with people who have
experienced the issue on the cards
they've sent in we've collected enough
data to more or less pinpoint this one
so the blue screen of death
the main one you're likely seen as irq
not less or equal and if that's the one
you're seeing that seems to be
associated with displays and so we were
able to reproduce this issue once and
shadow of the Tomb Raider with a g-sync
display specifically at 60 Hertz so it's
not high refresh but it is GZ and it's
an
oh geez display we were not able to get
that issue to occur on our 144 Hertz
freesync monitor with obviously adapted
sync not doing anything and we're not
able to get it working on our 100 Hertz
g-sync monitor so or not working in this
isn't where the bsod was only happening
to us with that specific display so in
talking with other people who have high
refresh displays that is exactly the
issue they're seeing where it's irq not
lesser equal with a high refresh display
often with g-sync enabled so if you have
high refresh any of g-sync that might be
the issue it might be display dependent
you can validate this by getting another
display that you might have in your
house already connect it and see if you
if the issue goes away and if it doesn't
I'm not sure if lowering the Refresh and
disabling g-sync will fix it but one of
the users who sent in a car did report
that that helped them with their
problems so I keep that in mind and
videos aware of this issue we actually
managed to get an Nvidia driver update
from one of the customers who's going
through the RMA process and they were
talking to support who provided them
with a an Nvidia driver update and also
one of the other users with a different
board got the Nvidia driver update and
so from one of those two people we got
the new head driver and what that does
is it should fix a number of issues and
one of them I believe from what we've
been told is supposed to be that irq not
less or equal because we have so much
difficulty reproducing that bsod in
general because we don't have the exact
displays causing the issues it's hard to
validate because like I said we've seen
it watch it twice
we saw it actually I remembered back in
our review of the 20 80 and the 20 atti
we did see a bsod also wants or twice on
the same 60 Hertz g-sync display but the
problem there was when you're reviewing
a product there's so many things that
could be wrong it could be the OS it
could be a CPU it could be an
overclocked issue it could be a software
level it could be a driver and without
the ability to consistently get it to
happen we can't pinpoint anything and
call it an Nvidia fault so we moved on
because it didn't happen anymore but
this is actually the exact same issue
that you all are seeing so apparently it
was a much greater deal than we knew it
was at the time but anybody's got a
driver update that's supposed to fix a
lot of that and our understanding from
Nvidia directly is that it's supposed to
come out this week
so we confirm that with them likely from
what others from from the fact that the
customers are getting the driver already
that should be true so if you're having
a bsod issue wait for the driver that
might fix it there are definitely other
problems like there are hardware level
issues some people have different VSO
D's we got a really specific CTD that's
been consistent a hundred percent
reproducible and I'm going to read you
what that message is so 100%
reproducible specifically on a one on a
secondary monitor so multi monitor is
another problem with these twenty series
cards if you're running multi monitor
that might be part of your issue try
disconnecting one of them so
specifically and only when we run multi
monitor with the 144 Hertz
no any sync no g-sync display we are
getting this error in some games like
GTA 5 specifically it's e e RR
underscore GFX underscore D 3 D
underscored in ini T so error graphics
direct3d initialization failed the
initialization please reboot and restart
the game try reinstalling the game of
this persists and if anyone actually did
that I'm so sorry because that's not
gonna help yeah that's that's completely
separate issue that's a multi-monitor
issue we can reproduce that 100% of the
time with a multi monitor configuration
with any 20 series card like all of them
so and the BSOD is also not limited to
specific cards it's also all of them it
is a display dependent issue and
potentially sometimes game dependent
given that we can most reliably
reproduce it in shadow the Tomb Raider
but when that game came out it was so
new that again we just assumed there was
probably a game level issue apparently
that was not the case though because a
lot of you are seeing this happen in
things like Dishonored for example so
that's what we got for you for now we
are also working on hardware level
issues the artifacting is the big one
clocks being locked to like 1,300
megahertz or in some cases even lower is
another big one so we're working on
diagnosing those trying to see if
there's a hardware difference see if the
serial numbers are in a certain batch
anything like that stay tuned for that
we're working hard on it we have a lot
more cards coming in if you have already
thank you we'll get it back to you soon
if you were sending one in please
continue to go through and send it in if
you are seeing any kind of artifacting
any kind of clock issues frequency fan
issues anything that's potentially
hardware-level
send it along to us you can email us at
dead twenty atti at gamers nexus net and
we're getting a lot of emails there so
I'm gonna try and respond to all of them
and please only email if you actually
have one you want to send in or if you
have a serial number for a card that is
working or no not working if you can't
send it in but you can send a serial
number and tell us if it's good or not
that would also help narrow down the
range and also describe the issue you're
seeing if you're seeing one so well of
updates for you soon but the first major
issue the BS or DS are very widespread
because it's all cards
it's just display and maybe game
dependent sometimes and we just got a
driver update for that so let's let's
see that's the news for you keep an eye
out on Nvidia's website this week and
hopefully you'll see a fix for your
problems if you not keep us posted
that's all for this one subscribe for
more as always go to store like aaron's
axis dot net if you want to support this
type of content specifically there's a
lot of extra and different work for us
you can grab this shirt while it's still
there I think we have maybe like two
dozen left or something so grab it from
the store if you want to pick it up
otherwise we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
