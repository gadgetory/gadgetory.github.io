down at Vega 56 the cheapest current
version of Vega at $400 this is the
reference card from AMD I need to put
thermocouples on it for thermal testing
so we're going to take this apart and
see if there's any difference between
this Vega feee and Vega 64 for which we
already have board shots and as a note
I'm shooting this one alone because I
gave Andrew the weekend off so we'll see
how it goes before that this coverage is
brought to you by cable mod already
well-known for their work in custom
sleeved power supply cables cable mod is
now venturing into liquid cooler tubes
leaving with their new AIO sleeping kits
compatible with corsair and NZXT as of
now check the link in the description
below for more information
alright so here's what we're going to
add to this thing a bunch of
thermocouples and probes and we need to
get the backplate off first which looks
like it's attached plus with Phillips
this time so this is a departure from
the Torx screws we saw on Vega Frontier
Edition which used TR 6 and TR 5 instead
this one is just using standard larger
size 2 Phillips screws and there are one
two three four six of these for the
backplate they are actually kind of
longer screws as you can see and then we
have four more to get out of there for
the retention kit the cooler look at the
cooler on the other side see if it's
another vapor chamber and aside from
that they're going to be selling the
shroud on the outside I'm not sure if
there's torts or not they were torques
on Fe we'll see if it torques here okay
there's the backplate it is actually a
fairly solid backplate in terms of just
construction it's not plastic it's metal
now does that matter
well depends on what's connected to and
this one is I mean it's just it this may
be more for looks than anything like a
lot of the backplate some of them
actually do have a thermal benefit but
not all of them do anyway that's off so
worried about that more once we're doing
thermal test
we can do some a beyond it next thing I
want to do
actually before gif going there is
removing the shroud so this is going to
be done by taking out one two three four
five six screws here and then I think we
also take some out of the i/o covers
towards the back of the card separate
these on our project Matt is that Radeon
logo we've got two eight pins on here
they go 56 and we'll be testing power
draw in the review obviously haven't
done it yet if you are curious about
power draw be sure to check that review
okay now that we're getting into the
more sensitive parts of the card I am
going to put it on an anti-static wrist
strap just because all the ways to
damage a review component static
electricity is one of the stupider ones
and although it is less common of a
problem with all the protection these
things have these days it's still not
something you want to do backside
alright so here we've got a couple of
screws on the back we have one two three
four five six so two over here are the
ones that secure the back plate - I
believe the base plate or at least the
shroud and on the other ones are just
for the i/o I'm going to start with the
two up here these are all Phillips still
don't paste on my hands or sharpie we
know how much you all like dry erase
markers so this is what happens when
you're working alone there's less
pressure to to perform I suppose so
just start throwing stains everywhere
and we do like to leave those kind of
silly mistakes and just anyone it's
entertaining and - it's just realistic
it's no point in trying to make
everything look like it's completely
flawless because the reality is it
probably won't be for most people taking
these things apart before anyone gets
confused these things here these smaller
screws we'll call them in the corners
those aren't real you don't have to take
those out they are plastic they're for
show only so don't try and hostess they
won't go anywhere I need to pull this
off first of all before before doing
that right here there's a little switch
there and that switch as many of you
know is a toggle for BIOS so they have
dual BIOS on here which is actually a
really nice feature for a reference card
that means if you wanted to flash it
you've got a backup never flash both
let's don't do that do not yeah
so looking the same as epi in terms of
that we got to get in further to figure
out the rest let's say warranty void
warranty void if removed you know I wish
these companies would would just stop
with those stickers for philosophical
reasons a lot of them do it not all of
them do it it is becoming less common
fortunately with some of the vendors
they're kind of learning but we're not
going to does it say remove too tampered
remove that well fortunately we're not
removing it are we
here going through it I don't know why
there's a screwdriver shaped hole on the
sticker it came that way I would never
open one I don't I wouldn't even know
where to begin with opening the video
card that's what you tell them right all
right so there's the all the retention
stuff off now we can pull the shroud
separate yet or do we need to remove the
get the base plate loosened there are no
more screws in the shroud and we're not
separating so I think we are actually oh
wait there's the screw on the top side
is now haha a sneaky screw right there
up here in the corner okay I don't think
that's going to really change anything
we still need to take the other screws
out these are for the base plate there
are one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten ten of these Plus that
one hidden on each side so 12 that we
have to remove I think okay that's the
fan we've just taken out these three
right here
those are for the fan which on FPU or
the Delta fan and it looks the same here
that one right there
it's obviously loose now so let's get
that the rest of the way out that is all
the screws so we need to separate throne
pads like that this is starting to look
pretty familiar to cables one for an LED
one for I think in Italy one for the the
fan okay so let's start looking this
board over on the back side we have
right here the voltage controller and
that controller is the same as Fe IR 30
five to 17 that is the exact same as
happy so they're using the same voltage
controller on here and I'll bet they
using the same vrm as well okay so
here's the PCB it looks pretty familiar
and there's a reason for that if you saw
our Vega frontier Edition coverage and
PCB analysis looks like it's pretty much
going to apply here we have the same
voltage controller these are the same
MOSFETs it's the same count of them
let's see one two three four five six
seven eight nine ten eleven twelve yes
so our still twelve phase these right
here it's an l-shaped vrm which helps
with propagation delays and we're able
to do that because there's no DDR
surrounding the chip it's all just HBM
so that means you can get this closer
but anyway it's still twelve days is the
same vrm as the frontier Edition if you
saw our front two your addition analysis
you can apply that here this is Vega 56
the fact that this has the same vrm
which is a pretty damn good vrm will
it's absolutely one of the better
reference cards we've seen especially
the dual BIOS which the fact this is on
here means this is a very expensive card
for Andy to make considering it's got HB
m to a high-end vrm and they're using it
in EFI you it should pretty much show
where it stands so that's probably the
well this absolutely is in 64 as well
we've seen it so same BRM 64-56 and EFI
which may come out cheaper for them if
they're just printing a mass quantity of
this board and putting the same stuff on
them all but anyways nothing not
exciting here what about the fan we look
at the fan the cooler and this I'll go
ahead and clean off that surface anyway
they don't know we print anything on
theirs though so we don't really have a
great way of knowing what revision it is
there's nothing on there maybe we can
just add something to it nope nope no
resist resist we look at the cooler next
so this is the cooler Malcolm and you
can see the text from the chokes
in the throne pads that's kind of cool
anyway let's skip this apart so what do
we need to take out at this point you
just pull okay so just pull right here
and it'll separate that makes it easy I
think we're still held on up here by
something if there's screw I'm Esther
what now we didn't miss any screws okay
all right cool so just kind of on there
tight so there's the shroud obviously
nothing nothing pretty here yeah I mean
there's there's nothing to look at here
so that's the shroud here's the Team
Rocket fan and let's look at this so
this is a vapor chamber cooler it's the
same one on the front to your addition
and it's a copper cold plate you can see
where the contact is clearly we're
contacting both HBM and the GPU here
there's no VRAM outside to be concerned
about and that's really all there is to
it I mean it's the same thin density
it's the same thin pitch it's the same
cooler as frontier addition so that's
very familiar to us and then the next
thing it's going to be the fan which
let's just go ahead and see if it's
Delta still yeah yeah so this is a it's
a recognizable logo most people know
that logo I think so the Delta where's
the there we go 2.4 amps for the fan 12
volt fan as usual 2.4 amps so does that
like 28 watts or something you got to
and this is powered through just before
anyone asks powered through the PCIe
slot not through the 8 pins at the top
so if you're monitoring the power
consumption of the board by the 8 pins
which is what we do you won't capture
the power that this consumes so you
basically add on another 28 watts if
it's moving at full
BeeZee 12 volts is what that would add
the same goes from pretty much all the
other fans as well so that's the fan
this is actually I mean it's not a bad
fan it's just the coolers not good in
general but that's that's pretty much
always the case with these reference
coolers Nvidia or AMD and I think that
mostly wraps up the card okay so that's
Vega 56 torn down
it is the frontier Edition that's what
it is a frontier Edition PCB its
frontier Edition vrm frontier Edition
cooler than heatsink everything on a
fifty six $400 card and then 64 same
thing so until we see a different PCB
design there's not a lot more to say we
won't be doing a separate 64 video
probably almost well unless there's a
special project but otherwise be on the
lookout for our AI v partner coverage
because that's where we'll start seeing
unique vrm designed since I am these
using the same board and vrm for all
three of their models which could go
either way I'm not a manufacturing
expert but I would imagine that one
option is it's cheaper because you're
buying a whole lot of the thin and if
you have a really low volume part like
epi which is a really low volume part
then buying a lot of that board and vrm
so that you can apply the 64 at least
would get your helping meet moq in the
very least the other end of it is you're
putting an expensive board and vrm on a
56 which i don't know if it needs it or
not we'll find out in power testing so
either way but in the very least the 56
has a good VR on it the reference 1 so
if you're going to liquid cool something
is probably not a lot of reason to buy a
partner model when you can buy one of
these liquid cool it and have a good vrm
already but otherwise if you're not
liquid cooling it as usual we suggest
buying partner models instead because on
nvidia and AMD parts these coolers not
so good but we already talked about that
in the frontier edition review and we'll
talk about it again in this review so
