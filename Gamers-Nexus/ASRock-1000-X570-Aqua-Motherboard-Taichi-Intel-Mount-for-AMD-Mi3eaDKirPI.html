copy tax 2019 as rocks got a bunch of
Acts five seventy boards the main one is
not on the wall right now but we have a
bunch of b-roll of it it's the Aqua
board and then we also took one of the
board's apart for builds ready to do a
PCB analysis and PRM analysis while
we're at the show so definitely check
back for his BRM analysis but we're
hopefully gonna take apart one other
board italy to be the ITX board or the
tai chi not sure which if we haven't
done it by the time this video goes up
then let us know what you care about
more before that this video is brought
to you by Corsairs iron claw RGB
wireless gaming mouse the corsair iron
claw focuses first on comfort with its
palm grip approach and also uses a sub 1
millisecond wireless connection for the
pc you can toggle between wireless and
Bluetooth connectivity making it easy to
control multiple pcs with one mouse like
a stream and PC and a gaming PC the
mouse has 10 programmable buttons the
pmw 30 391 18000 DPI sensor 3 zone RGB
LEDs and fifty million click lifespan
for left and right mouse buttons learn
more at the link in the description
below so first off the pricing we don't
have pricing on anything just yet
release day it's gonna be July 7th when
the horizon 3000 stuff comes out but we
can't talk about the specs so a lot of
these boards have a similar or the same
piece of erm design and the for example
gaming acts which is up there the
phantom gave me an axe at the top of the
wall and the Taichi share of erm so they
use a 12 plus 2 design they have 50 amp
power stages not 100% clear on the brand
we've heard IR for this but I know
they're also using a lot of TR moss and
inter-cell stuff and then it's got an
inner sill controller on it the ITX
board obviously has a different vrm
that's a 6 + 2 don't know the spec on
the power stages but what I can tell you
is that it's got TB 3 in the name
because it supports Intel Thunderbolt 3
which was as rocks primary marketing
point it was something you care about it
is on the board and it's one of the
first or only boards in its form factor
that supports Thunderbolt 3 speaking of
form factor no micro ATX boards sorry
MSI and gigabyte did not have any either
we'll keep an eye out but for micro ATX
fans we haven't seen any yet of the show
ITX does appear to be a bit more popular
this year than last time the Aqua is
worth talking about specifically that
one's going to be a limited edition
design so they're making 999 of them
they are going to cost 999 dollars
probably 99 cents but they I don't think
they're making point 99 board's either
so the aqua is a it's kind of like the
extreme water forest where it's just a
water block on the card it's a mono
block but it also cools the chipset and
the chipset cooling is a bigger
challenge with X 570 because it runs at
11 watts average or 15 watts peak and it
doesn't really down clock or slow down
for a thermal reason so you'll need a
fan on just about every board some of
them can sink it passively but not many
and then the hawk will just do water
equally it's a it's a halo product I
mean that's like same people who buy the
extreme water for us will buy that board
not meant for everyone but we do have
info on that one so the aqua has a
unique design it's using a different PCB
from the others on the wall here 12 + 2
inner cell it's got 50 amp power stages
60 amp chokes and then also Thunderbolt
3 the Creator we have a separate video
going up on with the PCB analysis that's
the one that we disassembled here it's
using a 3/5 201 controller and then
we've got some close-up photos of the
power stages as well as for the Tai Chi
Tai Chi is probably gonna be the one
that is more interesting for the
overclocking part of the audience
although it's not the the highest of the
high end that asrock has it is I'm on
the higher end boards along with the
gaming axe
so Tai Chi is primarily just going to be
another higher-end X 570 board they're
all pretty expensive this time because
the chipset cost is so high and also Gen
4 not easy it turns out the PCB quality
has had to go up on these boards some of
them to deal with the signal integrity
challenges that come with PCIe Gen 4 so
that is a cost driver is the PCB quality
along with the chipset cost I think
that's most of the info I have for you
on the asrock boards hopefully the
b-roll has suited you well and will help
you see some of the smaller features
because we are getting crowded out of
the booth one last they know what I
mentioned the ITX board does something
really cool which is it uses an Intel
mount so it's an AMD board but
an Intel set of mounting holes for the
CPU cooler which is very interesting the
reason is so that asrock can push in the
the mounting point and avoid the keep
out zone restrictions that AMD mounts
have so that's something that's just
kind of unique it'll be a bit confusing
I'm sure when you're buying the boards
but you know now thanks for watching
check back subscribe for more x5 70
coverage let us know if there's anything
specific you want here at the show we'll
go find it and a store doc gave us
access on that that was that directly
thank you for watching I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
