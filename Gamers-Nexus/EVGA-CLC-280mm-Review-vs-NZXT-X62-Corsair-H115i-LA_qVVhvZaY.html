was shown at CES last month marking the
company's first foray into the erupting
AIO market the new EVGA CLC 280
milliliter and 120 millimeter coolers
and yes the name is literally
closed-loop cooler will be competing in
the same market as the NZXT kraken x 62
and corsair h 115 i EVGA has taken a
more balanced stance between course and
NZXT offering some tone down LED
functionality while also lowering price
and keeping performance a focus before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by Thermaltake and their core p3
chassis which can serve as an ad hoc
test bench or you can wall mount it
which makes it pretty unique and
otherwise is built of pretty simple and
high-quality materials you can learn
more at the link in the description
below starting with the basics EVGA sa
i/o units are pretty straightforward
there are two models there's a two
eighty millimeter right here and then a
120 millimeter both of which use EVGA s
backs webspam design the pumps are a
stock Gen 5 pumps which we figured out
pretty easily by one asking and two
taking it apart you can see that
tomorrow from posting today the teardown
will go up one day later and we'll link
that in the description below once
that's been posted and the teardown
reveals that the insides are what you
would expect as a general a cynic Gen 5
comp there's not a bunch of
customization other than for the LED
plate in the top of the cooler and the
PCB is pretty comparable to Corsairs h
115 i but vastly different from NZXT is
kraken x 62 which has two really heavily
customized well one very heavily
customized custom-made PCB and that is
entirely for the RGB functionality and
then the normal ASA tech pump PCB
pricing is one hundred and thirty
dollars for the 280 milliliter unit and
$90 for the 120 millimeter unit which
places EVGA right between Corsair and
NZXT in terms of price for the size of
the cooler and the FDA's reminder there
Kraken X 62 direct competitor to this is
160 dollars pretty steep and of course
there's a CH 115 I is priced at about
120 dollars EVGA is cooler comes with
the usual Intel and AMD bruh
packets and they'll also be offering
free and for brackets for those who
purchase a units prior to the risin
launch they are planning for
compatibility nothing is new with regard
to mounting it's the same a trivial to
install a tech cap screws and standoffs
as always and we've come to appreciate
those and if you know installation for
any other AIO it's basically the same
especially if it's a stack a mini USB
cable runs to a USB 2.0 header on the
board to provide RGB LED control via
software the software unfortunately
wasn't ready for us to fully dig through
prior to the reviews publication thanks
to Chinese New Year we weren't able to
get that tool in time but we've worked
with the basics and can go through a few
features that are noteworthy one EVGA
plans to offer user serviceable firmware
on the pumps which is actually a
substantial point of interest and that
means that you can update your firmware
as you go or save profiles to it in
addition to user serviceable firmware
they're also planning to synchronize GPU
and cooler LEDs through the software and
we think it'd be interesting if EVGA
also explores this option for their
motherboards in the future the software
offers the usual fan speed control
options and they also have liquid
temperatures displayed there which is
based on a thermocouple that's placed
inside of the pump block reading the
liquid temperature and we show that in
the teardown if you're curious and then
of course there's your cold place at the
very bottom of the whole thing and
that's got the really densely packed
micro fins that we've come to expect at
this point from this type of a i/o so
everything looks like it should it's an
assemblage of plastic can copper more or
less with some liquid going through it
but the fans are quite a bit different
it's got the backs of fan blades design
with an open chassis that's going to be
pretty interesting for future testing
and then the pomp plate and block itself
allows for user customizable RGB LEDs
not to the extent of entities but still
customizable more than courses and the
profiles that can be saved to the pump
itself to the firmware means that you
can disconnect the cable later if you
wanted to ditch it and just save a
profile and let it run let's move on to
testing and thermals the methodology as
always is defined fully in the article
in the description below and we also
just posted about
20 minute long video talking to justice
evil has the complications of thermal
testing that you should think about if
you are thinking of doing your own
testing what we do is measure ambient
seconds a second we measure the core
temperatures second a second and then do
a delta value between them to account
for ambient fluctuations we're running
the RPMs at ten fifty fifteen hundred
and max rpm which in the case of the two
hundred eighty millimeter unit this 2200
rpm we'll be testing the 120 millimeter
unit later when this video goes live
I'll be on a plane to California for an
event so that review will go live after
but for now 280 is the thing we're
looking at versus the X 62 and H 100 or
H 115 and h100 I really to keep things
simple let's start with the EVGA only
results then add other 280 coolers and
then everything else averaged across
more than a thousand cells of data we're
seeing a load temperature of 39 point 5
Celsius delta T while at the lowest fan
rpm matched with a 7.3 C idle
temperature again delta T the 1500 rpm
temperatures that land at five point
four sells his idol and 34.7 load with
the unbearably loud 2200 rpm fan speed
getting us an extra two degrees Celsius
reduction in load temperatures it's
absolutely not worth the noise trade-off
in this scenario but the output does
show what's capable if you wanted to
live in a room where you've got a server
level stand noise look at decimal
numbers last for folks who are curious
about noise output let's add the NZXT
crack in X 62 competing 280 cooler and
the Corsair H 115 IV two numbers to this
chart matching first against NZXT EES
crack in X 62 the EVGA 280 milliliters
CLC which needs a new name we're
performing about 0.75 Celsius better
than the X 62 for the most part this is
a shallow victory we've got a variance
of approximately 0.5 Celsius in our
results after accounting for calibration
even so these two coolers are
functionally identical NZXT is running
at 35 point four nine tiles here's delta
T with EVGA at thirty four point seven
five Celsius delta T at the top and EVGA
has more rpm Headroom on its fans so it
supports a higher speed and therefore
tops the charts with a thirty two point
eight six Celsius delta T and that's
pretty damn good but again very loud
these highest rpm also loud is 1700 and
that lands it at 34.6 three soldiers LT
moving down now to 1050 rpm we see EVGA
start to lose some ground against mgi's
X 62 units our hypothesis currently for
this is that the two Celsius deficit
against MDX is cooler is likely because
the EVGA loses power in its fan towards
the low end of the PQ curve which is
strictly a function of fan design in
this case let's start course there now
of course there is a competing h1 15i is
priced at 120 dollars making it 10
cheaper than eega s and forty dollars
cheaper than mdx these coolers on this
benchmark looking at the performance we
see Corsairs h1 15 i at 1500 rpm is
functionally identical to the crack in X
62 and falls within our test to test
variant the Corsair and NZXT units are
equal strictly in terms of cooling at
this rpm making corsair the obvious
choice if you don't care for the leds
EVGA CLC to 80 millimeter cooler
outperforms corsair by about one celsius
one at 1500 rpm when we look at max RPMs
Corsair is cooler has fans I can hit
2,300 rpm with its SP series fans and
that lands of that 33.4 Celsius load
still EVGA is new CLP 280 cooler lands
at 32 86 and is a bit advantaged even
with the 100 rpm lower fancies but of
course design matters too and finally
here's a charge with all of the
temperature results this has a couple
other coolers present if you're curious
you can dig through those but they're
all going to be in the article in the
description below if you need more time
for the chart the most direct comparable
units are still the 280 millimeter
coolers that we've mostly run through
today and for the final charts we're
looking at the noise levels noise levels
are measured at 20 inches away with a DB
meter mounted to a tripod and we're
seeing the EVGA 280 and NZXT 280 course
both landing around 37 DBA with a 1050
rpm so keep in mind that EVGA was too
salty as warmer at this speed so ng XE
is advantaged in temperature at 1500 rpm
where EVGA it was advantaged in
temperature about 0.75 salties cooler
the EVGA unit runs at 45 out to DBA with
the NZXT x 52 at 46.4 DBA
so bit of a gain there but not too bad
overall
we saw the test accord
a 2015 i-4 noise levels but you can see
the rest of the noise tests on this
chart from previous benchmark EVGA is
first attempts at an AI o is remarkably
strong they've come out swinging and
have already beaten NZXT in terms of
noise levels if just barely and in terms
of temperature levels at the mid-range
again just barely kind of a shallow
victory because it doesn't gain you a
lot in terms of performance but they've
done well for first iteration design the
only place EVGA falls behind is in the
low end of the fan speed curve where at
ten fifty rpm there to Celsius warmer
than NZXT X 62 when it's at a similar or
actually equal rpm ultimately the
product stack now pretty much looks like
NZXT at the top in terms of price not
necessarily value but price there at the
top and EVGA and then Corsair for the
main three we'd be looking at for this
type of 280 millimeter liquid cooler
EVGA again is that $130 Corsair 120 and
exp 160 NZXT Zechs well really their
entire lines the kraken x2 series but
the X 52 between the three products were
mainly talking out here is a pretty
tough sell unless you really really like
the RGB LEDs that is it's only seriously
marketable point when compared against
these two more functions focused coolers
like the EVGA and the Corsair h 115
units so if you really like the pump
place and the Infinity design on on GX
is unit and they do have far and away
superior RGB LED control and quality in
terms of color and functionality has a
halt to anything on the table and the
Exige is better in that department right
now then clearly you should buy an tht
that's what matters if you don't care
about that
evie das got white Corsair has lights
EVGA is are a little bit more intense
and customizable than coursers I suppose
so if that kind of matters to you even
change the Victor if you just care about
price Corsair is still in a good
position but EVGA is actually out
matching Corsair for the most part and
is only $10 more does the extra dozen
temperature difference matter no not
really because we're at a temperature at
this point even with the non Delta
values we're not gaining any performance
out
CPU because you have an extra one degree
cooler core on the CPU doesn't gain you
a whole lot if you just want to be
better EVGA is just better and that's
really all there is to it at 1500 rpm
you're really at a tolerable noise level
that's probably where you want to stick
2100 rpm is a server room noise level
intolerable and I wouldn't recommend it
so you should really take heed of those
results I suppose that makes them look
great on the charts but noise matters
too so that's all for this review as
always subscribe for more will have the
120 units one toward torn down tomorrow
and to the full review will be online
once returned from the trip and then
we've got reviews of the Kraken series
all ready to check the channel to that
page shelling of the post roll video
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus to help
us out directly or go to the website
gamers Nexus net where we've got the
written review of this with a couple of
extra tests including one that I'm
really interested in where I'm going to
be blocking off the sides of the fan
where it's been cut out to see if that
matters now hopefully that goes up in
time for today's review but if not check
back thanks for watching I'll see you
all next time
