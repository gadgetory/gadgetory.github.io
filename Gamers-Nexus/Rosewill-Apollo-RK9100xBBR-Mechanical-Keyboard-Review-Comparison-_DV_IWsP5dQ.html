Nexus dotnet and today we're looking at
rose wills Apollo arcade 90-100 xbb are
a mechanical keyboard consequently
saying that name has been the bane of my
existence for the last two takes of his
audio this mechanical keyboard is priced
at $150 it's branded by Rosewill and
ships in brown and blue cherry switches
with blue or red backlighting the full
written review is linked in the
description below you'll find links to
alternative keyboards also in that
article so if you're looking for more
check on that let's go through the
features before we hit on opinions so
the keyboard uses cherry switches it's
feel will be exactly the same as any
other Cherry MX brown or blue switch
you've ever encountered the Apollo has a
full 10 key numpad a function key right
of the spacebar alternative functions on
f1 through f12 and alternative functions
on numpad 8 and numpad2 the numpad keys
will adjust backlight brightness between
four levels including off or three
brightness levels f1 through F six with
a function key serve as media control
options so played volume change mute
stuff like that and F seven through F 11
serve as gaming macro profiles with f12
toggling gaming mode on and off which is
basically just disabling the Windows key
other than that the keyboards got a sort
of rubberized texture everywhere except
for the keys which are just normal caps
just plastic caps the apollo ships with
alternative orange key caps for
directional keys and WASD keys and
honestly they feel a lot better than the
stock key caps they've got a bit more
grip to them as a result of the paint
and that's something I'd really would
prefer to see all over the keyboard
because the current one is just kind of
I don't know if they just feel kind of
normal and uninteresting to me in the
top right of the keyboard the Apollo has
two USB ports and two 3.5 milimeter
jacks which is always a nice feature on
a keyboard it has a thick braided cable
running to your system that splits into
USB and 3.5 milimeter which then carry
the signal to those ports or to the
keyboard itself
wrist rest is also included for those
who like it that is pretty much
everything in terms of specs as for
opinions well the the brown switches
feel like they always do the overall
click eNOS and tactility feels good it's
not really anything unique to board
manufacturers it's unique to switch
manufacturers so if you know the MX
brown switches and like them and you'll
like these I've had some issues with the
keys sticking or the switches sticking
on occasion maybe four or five times
since I've had the keyboard I've had a
key stick meaning if I hit E it just
keeps hitting me over and over until I
hit it again to release that and that's
out of probably a couple of hundred
thousand keystrokes because I've been
doing all the article right it's a bit
annoying but it's not dismal because
again four or five times out of hundreds
of thousands of keystrokes is not a
terrible track record but it is worse
than the g7 ten plus which I'll talk
about in a moment I do question if
that'll get worse with use though so I
caution you if you do a lot of typing
the software is sort of clumsy but it
gets the job done the only purpose of
Rosewell software is to map key keys to
functions so you can assign macros core
window functions things like that pretty
standard stuff really if you've used any
other mouse or keyboard mapping software
in the past you've with these you have
to sacrifice the base functionality of
that key or mapping so it's important to
find one you won't be using in game or
for text chat in the game switching
between profiles is very easily done if
you need to reclaim that key though I
would never recommend that for serious
gaming if you're already in the game and
you can just hit function f12 to disable
gaming mode altogether which will give
you all of your stock abilities back so
realistically I don't I'd never used the
profiles because remapping keys was kind
of not something I wanted to do when I
might use them for normal things I
remapped six through zero in
counter-strike that proved to be pretty
annoying because you need those keys
when you're buying stuff but I tried
mapping a couple other keys like insert
home page up page down and stuff like
that
and those work a little bit better but
again I don't know that you really gain
a whole lot of that out of that other
than maybe for MMOs or something like
that but that's that's what you have to
do to map stuff so the great thing about
the mechanical keyboard market is that
there's a huge amount of competition
which poses a problem for manufacturers
trying to get a foothold with new
products but it's a great problem for
consumers so as I note in the written
review there are a lot of great
alternatives at similar or lower prices
Logitech's g7 10 plus is a good one at
120 bucks Corsair k70
another good one at 120 bucks and pretty
high-quality components Das Keyboard is
is one of the premier mechanical
keyboard manufacturers and they have
stuff available in the same price range
ducky is a supplier and a manufacturer
they have their shine 3 in the same
price range
cooler masters got a 80 or 90 dollar
quickfire which is pretty good if you
don't need all the other functionality
so there are lots of options and there's
not much differentiating them some have
extra keys some don't some have USB and
3.5 jacks some don't so you'll
ultimately have to decide what features
are worth the extra money for your uses
for me at $150 I'd rather spend third
dollars less and get the K 70 or g7 10
Plus which has basically the same
feature set and even better in some
cases like the volume scroll wheel if
you're trying to spend less than $100
cooller masters quick-fire is pretty
good and Corsairs k70 does occasionally
go on sale for 80 to 100 dollars
depending on where you're buying I like
I like rose wills Apollo I just don't
think I could justify 150 bucks for for
something that is basically available at
120 elsewhere at 100 to 120 dollars I
would be much more likely to recommend
buying this keyboard as I said in the
written review the rubberized finish is
very nice and not something that you'll
find on most the other keyboards but
it's not $30 nice so that's all for this
time at please like comment and
subscribe as always check out the link
in the description below for the full
review and links to all of the
alternative keyboard options and I will
see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
