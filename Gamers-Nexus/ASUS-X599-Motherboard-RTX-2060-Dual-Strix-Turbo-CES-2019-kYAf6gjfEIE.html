2019 and we already have a tear down of
the matrix card which is behind me but
now we're gonna be giving you a
walkthrough of the three new 2060 cards
and also you've seen it before but it's
more or less than a finalized state now
the dominus the board that is for the
upcoming 28 core Intel CPUs that you you
may have seen at Computex and we did a
video on that before that this video is
brought to you by thermaltake score p3
case the core p3 is one of the most
unique cases on the market it can serve
as an open-air standing chassis a test
bench in vertical or horizontal
orientation or as a wall-mounted
showcase PC the core p3 now comes with a
5 millimeter thick tempered glass panel
for its slide but keeps the front top
and back open for air the core p3
versatility as a display piece test
bench or standard desktop is reinforced
by its price of roughly 110 dollars on
Amazon you can learn more at the link in
the description below so let's walk
through these today we'll start with the
2060s
the r-tx 2060s from acs come in three
different SKUs right now that we know of
there's the turbo there's the dual and
there's the Strix in terms of pricing
and availability the answer is I don't
know so we'll get that out of the way
right now the turbo probably is gonna be
at the low end it is a blower card it's
not the reference PCB that Nvidia used
though because if you look at the PCB it
is longer obviously than the 2060
founders Edition which is why they don't
have a solder to PCI Express cable to it
like Nvidia did so in that aspect a bit
better but the cooler is obviously
significantly different it is a blower
cooler the next card so we'll talk about
the dual or actually let's talk about
the Strix the Strix uses the same PCB as
the 2070 Strix so if you know the 2070
strict specs you know the Strix specs
for the 2060 here and otherwise it's a
Strix card just for the 2060 GPU on it
and then there is the dual which should
be kinda in between the two that I just
showed right here so it's a dual GPU
dual fan cooler instead and they're all
axial fans other than the blower card so
I mean that's all there is to the 2060 s
right now that we know if pricing will
really be the big thing here the rest of
it for VR I'm quality for PCB quality it
doesn't
matter quite as much as with a 20 atti
because it is a lower power part so
we'll talk about those later as we get
more info but Asus does have 20 60 s
coming up if you had any question the
more interesting thing is the Dominus
extreme and this is for the the 28 core
CPUs coming out to the 36 47 intel
socket we saw a version of this
previously but now the vrm cooling is
more or less finalized so we have some
shots of that I think of the massive
heatsink it is it is I don't know maybe
like 16 inches do we have dimensions we
do have dimensions so 14 by 14 board and
the vrm heatsink is 100% of that length
so that's the vrm heatsink under it we
haven't taken it apart looked at it but
they are ir35 for the MOSFETs and then
for let's just do a boardwalk through
EPS power connectors I think there are
44 or 40 it's 44 pins
total so they're for 8 pins and 2 6 pins
in there there's 2 24 pin connectors
near the 2 24 pin connectors Asus just
decided they had a surplus of pins from
their pin Factory and they also mounted
I'm counting 6 4 pin fan headers next to
the 2 24 pin headers next to that it
looks like some RGB pin out of different
varieties bonus points for that from a 4
a 6
actually that's quite a few connectors
on here normal 7 segment display start
reset best button in the world which is
the safe boot button and it looks like a
retry button as well so that's all
pretty standard stuff bottom side more
pin factory over supplies so there's 1 2
3 4 5 6 for pin connectors down there
there are I will just show a shot of the
board and you can count all the pins if
you would like to do that otherwise
though there is a small fan for the
chipset I don't know we don't know how
hot these will get for the new 3647
stock of CPUs typically though chips
that's really don't get that hot they
don't really need the cooling but I
think what's going on here is first of
all lots of i/o on this type of CPU
because it is a
effectively a server see it's a Xeon
class CPU 31 75 X or something like that
which Intel has shown previously so
you're dealing with more i/o maybe I'll
get hot enough to require a fan
so for nvme slots there are two dim dot
twos which HP's has had on boards before
those are flanking the memory slot
memory slots six on each sides you've
got total of 12 and I mean for the CPU
we'll talk more about that once we have
it in hand if we do end up with that one
I guess one more note that's worth
pointed out is on the i/o cover over
where there's another massive heatsink
there is an LCD so we saw this with a
god-like MSI board Asus is doing their
own version of a of an LCD on the board
it's on top of the i/o we'll see how it
looks when we hopefully get one to test
but I'll leave that one there for now we
we don't have pricing or availability
exactly on that but we'll have more info
for you soon on the 3175 x product and
it all fits motherboards going with it
so thank you for watching check the
matrix teardown if you haven't seen it
or check back if it's not up yet and I
will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
