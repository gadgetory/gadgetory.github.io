thought net and today we're talking
about bio stars h17 tz3 motherboard the
hi-fi series boards and this board as
the name indicates uses the h 170
chipset so it's not the same as the z170
chipsets we've looked at but many of you
probably already know the differences
from our previous video on chipset
differences I'll post the table here if
you need a reminder of what those are so
the H 170 board is more mainstream
targeted it is not the performance
market that z170 targets and to that end
there's no overclocking on H 170 but
that's fine if you're not an overclocker
if you're just trying to find a
mainstream or business board this would
be something that falls within your
search filtering the bio star hi-fi H
173 board uses a very unique feature
it's got two types of memory supported
on board because these skylake CPU
actually supports both ddr3l and ddr4
for memory types it's pretty important
to note here that ddr3l is not the same
as ddr3 it's low voltage as indicated by
the L and you could technically try and
make ddr3 work in a ddr3l slot like on
this motherboard but there's no
guarantee it'll work it's probably gonna
be unstable if the voltage isn't
natively low and you're better off using
either ddr3l
or ddr4 and nothing else this feature
means that the motherboard is targeting
a pretty specific niche it's primarily
aimed at users who want to move to
skylake but already have ddr3l memory
and don't want to buy ddr4 so that's
very specific
especially because ddr4 Ram is priced at
about 50 bucks right now for two sticks
of 4 gigabytes or 8 gigabytes in terms
of the specs supported by the bio star
board you can use up to 16 gigabytes of
ddr3 L at 1600 megahertz or you can use
up to 32 gigabytes of ddr4 at 21 33
megahertz so no high-speed memory here
and that is a limitation of the chipset
more than anything other than this the
memory of course is a big thing the
chipsets another big thing though with H
170 you get 22 HS io lands
so with z170 you get 26 HS IO lanes
this means that there are fewer high
speed io lanes available through the
chipset to the motherboard and that
means fewer high speed i/o devices can
be supported for a quick reminder H s
i/o devices include Gigabit Ethernet
they include PCIe devices video or
otherwise and they include SATA SATA
Express and things of that nature m dot
two certainly is included as well so for
the features on this motherboard there
are two SATA Express ports which can
double as SATA three ports so you can
use them as SATA 3 if you don't have
Express devices there are 4 SATA 3 ports
one m dot 2 gum stick port which
consumes four of the PCIe lanes on the H
170 a chip set so for the features on
this board the i/o includes a Gigabit
Ethernet port with surge protection
actually a nice feature on bio stars
part and that basically helps if you
have unstable power it'll assist in
managing the data transfer during those
up and down times so for the devices on
the board in terms of i/o a high-speed
i/o and all of that there is one PCI
Express by 16 port that is wired for by
16 so that's your video card slot
obviously and then there's a PCIe by one
slot which is usable for expansion cards
video capture things like that that are
lower lane requirement devices and then
for SSDs storage hard drives there's an
MDOT 2x4 LAN consuming gum stick port so
it is a gum stick SSD slot that uses
four HS i/o lanes from the chipset for
PCIe transfer of SSD data and then
you've got two SATA Express ports which
can double si a three and four SATA 3
ports which are the usual SATA device
ports at six a Giga bits per second
front panel setup has two USB 2.0
options one USB 3.0 to the front of the
case and the FPC the front panel control
plug in area has an annoying wall around
it with no labeling whatsoever for the
pin out so I would really appreciate it
if there were labeling on there instead
and if that wall were removed but that's
just sort of a weird older school design
that biased
opted for on the FPC and speaking to
older school designs there's oddly still
calm and parallel ports which are not
really useful for US markets but are
potentially useful for global or Asian
markets things like that
moving into UEFI and the interface we're
gonna show a bunch of screenshots of
UEFI now Biostar uses a dip chip for its
bios rather than an SMD and the XIII's
firmware visualizes Hardware monitoring
on the left side somewhat normal here
and that includes CPU fan rpm CPU
temperatures and mem and CPU specs which
include frequency and voltages for each
of those devices UEFI options are also
fairly bare-bones compared to a z170
chipset somewhat expected though and
that's particularly noticeable when it
comes to the lock to overclocking
functionality biostar has a one menu oh
and E as they call it and that allows
CPU multiplier up ticking - the turbo
clock so that users can force an always
active turbo boost setting but no
further overclocking is permitted so if
yours
turbos your CB turbos to 3.9 gigahertz
it will allow a multiplier of 39 even
though the reference base multiplier
might be something like 32 or 34 again
this is a limitation of the chipset over
volting is available should the force
turbo require a voltage increase and
this is extended to DRAM over voltage as
well for offsetting unstable but the
limited frequencies that are permissible
through the board CPU see states can be
disabled or enabled coinciding with
standards and the power limiters can be
lightly tuned through the OE menu this
is about the extent of the overclocking
tab though and we can look to Hardware
monitoring for something a little bit
more interesting on the Hardware
monitoring tab CPU fan speeds can be set
to smart which is dependent upon load
and PWM controlled and the system fans
are configurable to custom fan curves
mapped versus temperature so that's
always a welcomed feature as well
speaking briefly to the power and fan
headers on the board we were actually
very fond of bio stars decision to use
all four pen fan headers so you can use
all PWM fans with no three pin headers
present UEFI on the h1 70s
tria has a big focus on security
features which we can we've been showing
and will continue to show in these
screenshots and those security features
include things like secure boot platform
key management authorized signatures and
time stamps and things of that nature
which are potentially useful in small
business applications but pretty useless
for the average enthusiast gamer or
mainstream system user from other boards
we currently only do two objective tests
and those are boot times to get into
Windows 10 and then a power consumption
test measuring the total system wattage
so the chart we're going to show you for
power consumption shows full load on the
system using fire strike extreme which
is a 3d mark tool and that's run on the
combined test so the CPU and the GPU are
both stressed we use an identical bench
for all tests on all motherboards other
than the board itself of course and you
can check the specs on that bench in the
link in the description below at the
article jumping right into it it's no
surprise that the stripped-down Mini ITX
board from EVGA runs at a lower power
consumption than the other on bench
boards that's largely because it's
smaller it's got fewer devices on it a
lot less i/o and simpler chip logic
overall other than the chipset itself
full system load shows the micro ATX h1
70 z3 operating at 300 18.8 4 watt
compared against the Mini ITX EVGA board
which was operating at 300 4.4 eight
watts and the full ATX MSI be 150 a pro
we've yet to review operating at 3 25.8
5 watts boot times show by oh stars h1
70 z3 motherboard as the fastest booting
board currently on our bench beating out
the MSI be 150 a pro by 0.9 3 seconds
and the EVGA stainer by about 2.9 3
seconds the h1 70 z3 jumps to the
desktop
that's Windows 10 so from off to Windows
10 usable and around 19 seconds after
pressing the power button without any
special features enabled and BIOS to
make it boot faster by oh stars h1 70 SZ
3 motherboard has every feature you'd
want in a mainstream board it's security
features are complete and very usable
for small businesses
that don't have ultra complex
requirements but still want some
security and platform key management
it's mainstream user issues are what
you'd expect you can do one PCIe video
card you can do one PCIe X 1 divided by
n other ly unused especially because the
video card covers one of them so those
are just kind of pointless and only
there to satisfy a dated standard at
this point so the board overall there's
not a lot we have to complain about the
only thing to complain about is its
biggest feature which is ddr3l and ddr4
support this feature alone makes it kind
of tough to justify the board because if
you look at the market you can get a
gigabyte as rock or Asus board in the
same price range from ninety dollars to
one hundred and five dollars at the high
end with this board falling at the
hundred five dollar price point so then
what's what's making the purchase worth
it if you have a need for ddr3 L is
strictly the fact that you don't want to
spend an extra $50 on ddr4 memory so at
that point when you're looking at I
really need to save $50 so I'm gonna buy
the specific board that limits my
upgrade potential by limiting the amount
of memory slots you can saturate well
that's that's a tricky situation I would
probably advise that you just save off a
bit longer and buy the memory instead
and do a full upgrade if you want to
split the upgrade certainly that's your
prerogative the board is good otherwise
so I have no major complaints about the
board in general but from a value
standpoint you might get a little bit
more mileage out of a board like the
Asus or gigabyte options where you have
a full four sticks available through
four slots that are one type of memory
so you can expand to a higher capacity
and you might get higher frequencies if
you opt for a hundred ish dollar z170
board instead that's all ddr4 so that's
the general thought on this board
no major complaints other than its main
selling point so if you want that
selling point it's not a bad board but
that's just a small market so you should
know who you are if you are one of those
people that's all over the time if you
like this type of cover
