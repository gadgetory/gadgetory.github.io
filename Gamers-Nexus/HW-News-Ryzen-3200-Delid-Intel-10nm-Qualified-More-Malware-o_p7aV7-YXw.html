heartburn news recap for the last week
our leading story Intel qualifying ten
nanometer CPUs that's actually a big one
rise in three and the thirty two hundred
G allegedly deleted and shown shadow
hammer the is involved malware hammering
at least six more victims of note and
50th anniversary AMD product
announcements continue along with
several other news items before that
this video is brought to you by MSI's RT
x 2070 gaming z 8 gigabyte card the RT x
27 t gaming z uses MSI's dual fan design
with large blades which we've previously
tested to have them on the best noise
normalised thermal results in the class
MSI is 27 t gaming Z has a fat heatsink
furthering the focus on reduced noise
levels by allowing the fans to spend
slower RGB LEDs naturally are abundant
on the card but can be blacked out to
match the carbon and blackout shroud
learn more at the link in the
description below
quick GN note first this shirt the one
I'm wearing has been restocked on the
store not not literally this one it's
gross I've been working all day but the
blueprint shirt is back on story I came
from Texas Donna if you've wanted one we
have finally restocked them thank you
for your patience you can pick them up
there and they'll ship immediately Intel
qualifying 10 nanometer CPUs or intel
has acknowledged that is 10 nanometer
process is going through qualification
it did this in its earnings call that
was just held as of filming yesterday
and it indicates that the year-end
release for ice Lake you CPUs should
actually be realized these 10 nanometer
chips will land in portable devices like
notebooks and debut the long-awaited
launch of ten nanometer products by
Intel technically there's been one kind
of on the market but no one talks about
it until I anticipates sale and shipment
of 10 nanometer CPUs for notebooks in
third quarter of 2019 with market
availability for consumers at B us in
fourth quarter of 2019 so in theory just
in time for the important holiday
consumerism season we previously spoke
about sunny Cove with David Cantor the
expert analyst who has joined us several
times and if you'd like to see
what sunny Co kind of is at the top
level it was presented well it wasn't
that time it was an architecture
discussion at the level it was presented
to us and around December of last year
we do have that video on the channel of
course will link it up there somewhere
and this will feature Intel's more
powerful I GP critically it will also
have in silicon mitigations respecter
and meltdown so that's another important
point and power consumption improvements
along with process changes in general so
all of that is coming to the ten
nanometer parts that are finally getting
qualified and presumably shipping it's
just that it's not the desktop part that
all of us want to see the Vizia space
that will presumably follow the notebook
part though so we'll keep an eye out for
that on all of this Intel CEO Bob Swann
stated the following in an earnings call
on the ten nanometer process technology
fronts our teams executed well in
quarter one and our velocity is
increasing we remain on track to have
volume clients systems on shelves for
the holiday selling season and over the
past four months the organization drove
a nearly 2x improvement in the rate at
which ten nanometer products move
through our factories so there's your
update on Intel ten nanometer I just
really want it to come to desktop at
some point so we have something new to
play with but rise in three or well rise
in 3000 series will be coming out soon
so we'll get something there and the
Rison 330 200 G D lid shows solder Tim
or a solder interface and more
overclocking Headroom in theory so this
was done on chip Hal and a couple of
other sites in the West picked it up
like Tom's hardware and AMD news is the
company is at forthcoming 3000 series AP
use the report via chip Hal shows that a
prominent forum member has managed to
deal it arise in three 3200 G the D LED
process was evidently pretty surprising
as the user purportedly found the
horizon 330 200 G APU now uses solder
Tim between the die and the IHS after
dissecting both the 3200 G and last
generations 2200 G the user noted die
sizes are the same as is the core count
and Cashel almond what appears to be
different aside from a soldered IHS is
the overclocking prowess of the new
chips we actually did D lid the 2200 and
the 2400 G previously in fact we did an
additional test on it and ran an IHS
that was just copper with new nickel
plating it was from rocket cool ran some
thermal tests with that so and liquid
metal by the way so there were
improvements there's just there's such
low-power parts they've not needed
solder and the thermal pace is just fine
but we're not going to complain about
the addition of solder if it improves
the product so according to the users
overclocking tests and keeping in mind
this product doesn't officially exist
yet the horizon 3 3200 G and rise in 530
400 G allegedly yielded 300 megahertz
and 320 megahertz overclocks
respectively at the stock one point
three eight volts at least the stock one
point three eight volts that was running
on that motherboard what's more of the
chips didn't run any hotter than their
2000 series counterparts hitting 76
degrees Celsius at full load but we have
no idea what the tests and conditions
were we don't know how will they control
the environment things like that so that
number is of limited usefulness because
temperature is not a 3dmark score but
it's promising or at least makes logical
sense anyway given what we know so it's
hard to draw any meaningful conclusions
here from such a small sample size but
and these refined silicon and optimized
Zen plasters and two architectures the
3000 series ApS are rumored presently to
use both should certainly yield some
Headroom so no word on when the chips
are supposed to launch but Kombi tax is
around the corner and he is hosting a
keynote there and that would probably
make sense as a launch time it's as good
a place as any to make an announcement
moving on shadow hammer hit at least six
more victims as it turns out asus was
not the only company affected by
operation shadow hammer as the Kaspersky
security team found in one of our
previous news videos we talked about
this the asus software was vulnerable to
this attack it's since been patched it's
mostly for notebooks but ever since this
security researchers have come across
multiple malware samples leveraging both
the similar algorithms and legitimate
digital
tickets akin to the ACS attack all told
there are six additional companies that
appear to have been attacked in a
similar fashion to issues of those six
researchers only divulged three
electronics extreme innovative
extremists that's kind of a rough name
and Zepeda the other three companies
compromised but not yet identified our
quote another video game company quote a
conglomerate holding company and a
pharmaceutical company all in South
Korea and presumably these have a wider
reach and might be getting some private
contact before it's publicly disclosed
for sake of securing the issue before it
can be exploited in the case of the
video game companies that were disclosed
that be electronics extreme ends a pedo
hackers are able to inject malicious
code and payloads aimed at infecting
systems and then the trojan eyes games
can begin gathering information like
user names IP addresses MAC addresses
computer settings operating system
information and whatever else they have
access to shadow hammer and shadow pad
are becoming a very high-profile supply
chain attack and it may not be over yet
researchers noted that quote how many
more companies are compromised out there
is not known what is known is that
shadow pad succeeded in backdooring
developer tools and one way or another
injected malicious code and to digitally
sign the binaries subverting trust in
this powerful defense mechanism so far
the count is at seven last week we
reported on and these special edition
Rison 720 700 X processor to be unveiled
for its 50th anniversary coming up along
with some partner launches like
sapphires card and gigabytes motherboard
for the 50th edition or 50th anniversary
launches and while the chip is all but
officially confirmed new leaks suggest
that there may not be any special
bidding or cherry-picking that would
lead to higher frequencies our
overclocking and if that's true I
sincerely hope that the rumors are not
true then we won't have a whole lot of
reason to buy one but hopefully
hopefully there's some special bending
or overclocking Headroom because we'd
really like to get our our risin systems
to work doing some overclocking
livestreams but either way there is
something special the dr. Lisa sue them
or at least it'll be laser etched into
the IHS for whatever that's worth in
addition to a black and gold
commemorative packaging so hopefully
there's more to it than that but that
said it's possible AMD may still have a
surprise left to announce for this
upcoming 50th anniversary and the risin
7 2700 X presumably will be made
publicly known on April 29th
the next one in laptop mags annual tech
support showdown the site gauges the
tech support offerings of top laptop
vendors by posing as average consumers
via phone live chat and social media
they then compile the results and assign
each company a score for 2019 laptop
Magda finds that Apple continues its
streak at the top followed closely by
razor razor second place spot is notable
as it was ranked second to worst last
year so razors improving here MSI on the
other hand fountain finds itself now in
last place a place it was familiar with
on these charts according to laptop bag
previously MSI most recently showed its
customer support in aptitude by way of a
customer support agent informing a
customer incorrectly on the 300 series
and its support for upcoming rise in
CPUs which you are all likely familiar
from our last week's news episode
Microsoft changing the tune on the Intel
CPU shortage if you recall previously in
one of our Hardware news episodes
Microsoft had and earnings call where
I'd stated that shortages in the Seaview
market although it did not name its
partner that it was accusing it was
Intel we're hurting Windows 10 adoption
and now Microsoft has sort of changed
this the company stated quote we feel
good about the supply in the commercial
segment and the premium consumer segment
which is where the vast majority of our
revenue is an OEM and so I think in
those segments we feel fine for quarter
four this is from Microsoft CFO ami hood
Microsoft's recent earnings and some
part have been supported by consumers
who are migrating to newer at
of Windows probably finally off of seven
or new machines with recent Windows
versions Microsoft is ending support for
Windows 7 it's ending sequel server 2008
support and that's a trend that
Microsoft expects to continue into
quarter 4 as well for growth of adoption
and Microsoft could also be less
concerned about Intel as more OEMs and
consumers alike turn to AMD it's
doubtful that Microsoft has any special
interest in which CPUs are in Windows
machines so long as their Windows
machines Sampson announced a 12 year
plan to invest one hundred and fifteen
billion dollars in both its Samsung LSI
and Samsung foundry businesses the plan
will see Samson inject roughly at nine
point five one billion per year through
2030 into its businesses the sixty three
point four billion investment will be
into R&amp;amp;D in South Korea while another
fifty two point 1 billion will be spent
on facilities expansion and
infrastructure by 2030 Samsung aims to
be not only a leader in memory but also
logic chips Sam some notes that between
now and 2030 the investments that will
come with increasing its workforce by
some 15,000 jobs and finally Intel
finally announced the rest of its coffee
lake refresh lineup if you've forgotten
coffee lake it's back and it hasn't
really gone away
this is alongside the eight series of
mobile chips rounding out the
long-awaited
ninth generation family being another
rewarmed iteration of skylake there are
not too many notable new features or ibc
increases or things like that to discuss
but the chips do bring higher
frequencies within the same TDP profile
Intel adding turbo boost support to the
entry-level I three models is perhaps
the most radical change and one that is
no doubt a response to and these rise
and three models that are aggressively
priced versus Intel's pricing for its
own i3 models the full 9th gen lineup
offers the traditional non-case SKU
variants of the high-end 9900 K the 9700
K the 9600 K so you've got the non K
versions of those also quick aside 9th
gen not particularly fair naming it's
9000 series it's it's 8 generation which
is kind of refreshes from before that
but
not really a new generation of itself
additionally Intel is debuting the not
traditional K F and F suffix skews which
indicates chips with stripped iGPS the
lineup is punctuated by the new six core
and eight core mobile parts such as the
99 a th K and the 98 50 H which will be
making their way into laptops soon so 99
a th k might actually be pretty fun to
work with we'll try and get one we might
actually just buy a laptop with one of
those if we can't get one because that
should be an overclocking part in a
laptop and hopefully it's fun to work
with so even if it's not super practical
buy so we'll try and get one but that's
it for the news for this week thank you
for watching as always subscribe for
more go to store die cameras nexus net
