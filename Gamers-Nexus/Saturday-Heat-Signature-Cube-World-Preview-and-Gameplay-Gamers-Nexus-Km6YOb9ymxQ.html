Nexus Donna I know it's been a while but
we are actually working on a brand new
video series I'm gonna put one online
every single Saturday called heat
signature heat signature is basically a
video series that will look at the games
that are lesser known like the one I'm
talking about today cube world and try
to bring them to your attention try to
give him a little bit of hype and drum
up some interest there so cube world is
the one we're talking about today it's a
really cool game I just discovered it a
couple days ago thanks to my friend
legendary cake from the gamers Nexus
forums and basically it's a combination
as stated by the developer himself of
diablo minecraft zelda and a little bit
of MMOs in there he didn't specifically
mention EverQuest he mentioned Wow
actually but I really see a ton of
EverQuest elements in here when i watch
the videos and that has be stoked and
what's the I don't even know where to
start with cube world to be honest it's
so cool it's just it's a massive open
world it's a voxel-based game ok so it's
cubes and you know generating cubes just
like kind of like minecraft does and it
is a very big open world generator you
can do some building it's not as as
creativity focus that minecraft is it is
more adventure focused and more
exploration focused which honestly is
cooler to me because it has a little bit
more longevity creativity it's great if
you're really creative person if you
have a lot of time on your hands if you
have a lot of people to share with but
adventuring is really where the bulk of
the fun comes in for a lot of us I think
and in this game the reason that
venturing is so cool is because there
are tons of different types of monsters
and they will appear based on the biomes
the game is focused heavily on combat
exploration on quests on seeing cool
things I'm looking at biomes with
different creatures in them and so I
mean they're dragons or lizard folk orcs
trolls all kinds of stuff you can even
have pets like you can get a pet dog pet
horse so I don't know if you call it a
pet more of a mount but you get what I'm
saying and the game is combat focused
more than minecraft which is really just
kind of its
you know what I'm talking about if you
played it's a really clunky combat like
minecraft you just really want to focus
on building and mining once you get into
combat it sort of ruins the immersion of
the game cuz so simplistic and so basic
you just hold down left click and back
away and hold it again but this game
actually I mean you you have real health
you have levels you have an iron
minecraft has added some level stuff but
this is much more focused and really
adventure game based so from the get-go
their levels experience you can get
quests from NPCs you encounter NPCs can
have shops you can build buildings wall
to wall instead of block by block and a
while by well building really just means
it's templated to some extent their
blueprints in this game so you for
example to get like a 10 by 10 blueprint
of a wall and then you put it next to
another one and then you eventually
build a house or a store or a lighthouse
or something to that extent and
certainly it's it's a little bit more
limited than mine craft but there's
still a lot of room for creativity in
there especially if a mod API is
developed in the future getting down
more into the game it is currently
called Q world but the developer
recently announced in a tweet to one of
his fans that he does have a new name
for it he will be changing the name when
alpha comes out there's currently no
alpha or beta just a lot of videos and
speculation and screenshots but he will
be changing the name we don't know what
it's called yet but I will be sure to
let you know as soon as it changes and
he said he's planning to launch alpha
within the first quarter and I don't
know if that's entirely realistic but
you know it's a pretty complete looking
game as you can see here playing in the
background so if it happens then that's
excellent I can't wait to play it
regarding items there will be no custom
item creation like in Minecraft you
can't create it from scratch so far you
might add it later but so far not really
you do get upgrades you can add cubes to
your weapons your armor and you can
actually shape the way your weapon looks
so you can make it jagged on the left
side or alternative alternating jagged
spikes off the sides of
left and right you can wear helmets you
can customize them and make them out of
different will not make them but you can
upgrade them out of different materials
and you can enchant them with spirits
they're called you get them from spirit
stones the enemies drop all this really
cool stuff and it always comes down to
exploring and to adventuring and that's
where Zelda really shines and where
minecraft sort of stops and gets super
boring is the adventuring so when I say
adventuring I mean combat I mean
discovering dungeons and cool items
really cool places and fighting your way
through the world and and you know all
that kind of stuff you know what I'm
talking about if I didn't say it already
there will be dragons in this game the
dungeons which have only recently
started leaking out private developer
will have traps they will have levers
their true dungeons I mean they're the
kind of stuff there that you might find
in Diablo and might find in any other
game they're not like not super complex
but they are cool and I've seen
screenshots where their traps that shoot
fire out of the walls there's levers
that you need to find and pull to open a
gate and stuff like this skeleton
zombies all that good stuff I'm sure
their treasure chests in there and it's
really kind of it's a fun dungeon
delving experience from the looks of it
of course the above the overworld
exploration is really where the game was
currently focused but he's adding
dungeons as we speak or as i speak i
should say unless you're talking with me
which is kind of weird because I talk
kinda fast so you don't really get a
chance to speak but looking at some of
the other stuff I'm just looking through
a list right now there's so much cool
stuff this game and it's like it's
growing every day
and it's entirely focused on on that
experience that I've been talking about
it's focused on that building that
growing that ever growing universe
experience totally voxel-based the
graphics as a technology aren't anything
extremely impressive but the aesthetics
are really a really great looking
aesthetics versus graphics if you don't
know there's an old penny arcade
discussion panel where where they say
aesthetics are how a game cohesively
appears with everything together so all
the colors all the textures versus
graphics which are technology oriented
but that's another discussion looking at
gameplay there will be different races
and they will have an effect on gameplay
so if you play a frog person you might
jump higher if you play an orphan I have
more stamina kind of that kind of stuff
and and you know it's it's what you
might find in an MMO but it's really not
super common in these in these builder
based games builder as in the gamer
personality and so that's kind of cool
to see magic and spells and skill trees
and stuff like that a game that's really
based around just seeing things and and
I think that's what's going to make this
game explode in popularity over the next
couple months so keep your eye on it
you'll definitely want to look pre-order
it while it's cheap if this is your kind
of game you can plant a home anywhere
you can build your villages I'm sure
there will be mods of all types if he
has an API or if he has a way to plug
into the game he hasn't yet announced
one but it is built on directx 9 he says
you will need about 2 gig of ram which
i'm sure almost everyone here has if you
don't then go to gamers nexus dotnet and
look at one of our custom pc builds we
help you put them together for dirt
cheap so if you need help with that
we're here he says you only need a
directx 9 compatible GPU so nothing
fancy and then it is I'm just looking at
the screenshots here this game is
beautiful again it is so cool there's
already a couple fan sites out there
I'll put those links in the description
below but anyway I'll be doing more
posts on this as I get more news and
updates and more videos of course so
