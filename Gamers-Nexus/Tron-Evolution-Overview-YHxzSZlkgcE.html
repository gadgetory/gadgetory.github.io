the the whole Tron law and knowing full
well that you have the sort of the
watching world looking or what you're
gonna do to such a seminal piece of work
the reaction we'll get from people when
they see drawn it's it's heartwarming
really it's the effect okay I wasn't
alone there just a dream project from
the standpoint of a you know
ten-year-old kid who got to go and see a
theater on opening day when you play the
game you see the movie you'll see the
world of Toronto as you knew it but
you'll also see the advancements and how
it's growing into an actual world
I think they did a really good job of
creating this kind of seamless line
between the video game and the film so
that people can feel their experience
extended we're gonna be telling people a
story that's really gonna build up to
the movie in a way that I like to think
you haven't really seen much in video
games at the moment they came up and
started principal filming we sat down
with the guys were literally allowed on
set free reign over what was there for
the assets as soon as we found out the
sets were open the Copts in the cab went
over there and just drink it in we
talked story
we bought visuals we shared assets back
and forth between the movie in the game
we've given them our designs that given
us some of theirs we're really trying to
create a world and a story that feels
like it's one big piece while we were
making the film we had the video game
very much in mind in fact you'd be
shooting very important scenes we would
think at this point the gamers are
really gonna be able to key into this
point and understand that they were the
ones I was actually referencing they fed
us to put us in the right direction so
that our story would end up in the right
place to kick off legacy the video game
is giving people a chance to really
explore areas of the world that you
don't see in the film get the sense
what's down that Street or in those
mountains or behind that door this was
thought through these two things were
intended to look better together that
has separate folks the real trick is
standing apart yet still meshing really
nicely with the movie
