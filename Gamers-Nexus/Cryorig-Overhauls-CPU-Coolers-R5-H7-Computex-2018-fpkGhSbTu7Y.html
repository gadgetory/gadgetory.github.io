cryo rig booth now they have a couple of
updates for this year the main one I
think that you all will be interested in
is the r5 cooler so r5 was shown
probably about a year ago never really
came out it's finally coming out and
they have a reason for it it's new
mounting system so we talking about that
for the show and then also they have a
new fan design that we'll be talking
about and the frost bit MDOT - that's
his D cooler that I mentioned at a news
video recently before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the vo 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 so for the r5 cooler
this basically it's the same thing you
saw previously except they've changed
the mounting system so now it's sockets
into a motherboard just you here's how
it goes you install a mounting plate
with four screws in it no cooler and
then the click mount system with a Q
sockets in sort of I'd an angle and then
it just clicks and then you go in
through the top of the screwdriver
tighten down the single screw so
technically it's about the same amount
of screws maybe one more but because you
attach the mounting plate before getting
the cooler on top of it it's a bit more
convenient because you're not gonna have
to like try and get your fingers under
the side of a sharp heat sink and cut
your hands up so that's the idea so yes
more screws but way easier to install
and remove is the the approach for this
one so that's our five it's supposed to
be about $70 quarter three ish for the
launch on that one probably and
otherwise two fans on it and I think the
big thing here is the click mount
mounting system we'll show you footage
of it it'll make complete sense when you
see it other than that they're supposed
to be moving that mounting system to
most the products going forward
especially the tower coolers in speaking
of tower coolers the h7 very popular
cooler from cryo reg has now been
upgraded so it has one more heat pipe
it's got four now instead of three and
they're coming up based on ultra don't
really know the price impact yeah it
shouldn't be more than five six dollars
to get that extra heat pipe and
obviously we haven't thermally tested
anything here at the show but it would
do a little bit just not sure how much
other product updates really quickly
they've got a fan here at 1600 rpm fan
it's an RGB fan the only thing that's
really noteworthy with this is that
they've replaced the entire chassis so
the fan shall the square normally is
gone and instead they've gone a sort of
a perforated panel similar to the n7
motherboard that's on the wall right
here so it's a perforated panel and all
it does is just bring out the RGB circle
on top a bit a bit more that's really
the kind of start in the end of the fan
nothing too special with it just killing
the chassis for RGB purposes
finally the frost bit cooler we talked
about this previously so it's got a
pivotable basically heatsink on top to
get out of the way of GPUs and you sit
it on top of an m2 device it's got a one
millimeter thick thermal pad in there
heatsink and sinks the SSDs now couple
things here we talked about it before
SSDs don't generally need to be heat
synced you probably won't need that
extra performance thermally it'll be
fine in some cases yes you might be
thermal throttling with an m2 SSD
primarily with raid but pretty rare and
also in terms of these products you
actually don't want to cool the flash
you want to cool the controller but
they're not gonna go below ambient
anyway so it's really kind of hard to
say how much of an issue that actually
is in reality in theory your endurance
is improved for an operating piece of
flash as the temperature is higher and
also reduced for increased temperature
if it's inoperative so kind of inverse
there where the controlling needs to be
called flash doesn't but because they're
not going below ambient flying out a
huge deal and if you do have an issue
with your controller overheating then I
guess you can look into an MDOT to
cooler ultimately if I give you my
opinion on these types of products I
think it's more of an accessory thing
it's kind of a higher margin type of
thing this is what I'm interested in so
that's the r5 cooler it's got the click
mount system from what I'm told it
should have about the same mounting
pressure as going with the traditional
four screws because what happens is as
you screw down into that black plate at
the bottom which has a screw in it it
will pull the plate up so it's just
pressure pulling it up from getting
tightened that'll apply all the down
pressure on the IHS
or the CV on the socket so that's
Craig's booth thanks Washington as
always subscribe for more copy tax
coverage go to patreon.com/scishow and
Zach's it stops out directly and stored
on cameras nexus net to pick up one of
our mod mats or one of the award
crystals that we'll be giving out here
at the show
hopefully the vendors don't buy them if
they don't win it instead I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
