net and we're here at Corsairs sweet in
the Palazzo at CES 2016 i'm joined by
george matrice and all of this coverage
is brought to you by iWay powers revolt
2 small form-factor gaming pc today
we're going to be talking about the
tooling of cases it's sort of an
interesting topic so can you give people
a brief overview of what exactly is tool
and what do you mean when you say
tooling for a case yeah ok so basically
when you manufacture a chassis like this
there's you know steel components and
the majority of structure of steel or
aluminum most the time we use steel
because it's a little bit more rigid and
it's a lot less costly and it's no
benefit to make the chassis out of
aluminum except for weight savings which
isn't really that big a difference when
you talk about chassis so when we talk
about tooling what happens is they have
these giant stamping machines and
various other machines that they take a
flat roll of steel in a certain
thickness whether it be 0.6 or 0.8 or
1.0 millimeters whatever and they take
that and they run it through and they
stamp out and cut the shape of the parts
right and then those parts get stamped
and sometimes it's multiple stages so
they'll take one to cut the outline and
then the next one will bend a frame and
the next part will do this in this and
so there's multi stage tooling and those
tools that though the presses are a big
machine of the factory but the the
insert that goes in the press to cut out
the right shape that's called a tool and
that tool has to be manufactured
specifically for each piece you want to
make so for a typical case you're
looking at what could be in dozens or
even like a hundred plus different tools
they have to be assembled and
manufacture sometimes to get this done
that doesn't even count the plastic
injection molds and all that stuff so
for a steel it's it's really complex and
how many parts get made so if you look
at something like a 600 q like this one
this side panel is a big flat sheet of
steel now it looks like it might be
really easy to do but if you take it off
you'll realize it's bent over itself a
couple times now for structural
integrity and make it the lip so it fits
in there there's screw holes in the back
so you can fit the thumb screws in all
that stuff has to be done in a stamping
and the machining set and so this is
probably like a two or three stage tool
for just that side panel something more
complex like a motherboard
or the rear fan mounts with a PCI
Express slots and all that stuff that
might be a six or seven step tool stage
so as this is the cooling process when
you're actually stamping it out is that
automated are there operators
it's a mix depending on which factories
you go to some of them are more
automated than others
most of them have some level of operator
whether it's an operator they're running
the stamp machine or the touring machine
depending on which you know which
factory you're talking about most of
them are mostly manual but there are a
lot of automation things happening more
and more and one of the big things that
you can tell just by looking at case is
a sort of thickness or rigidity of the
steel how does that impact when you're
assembling the final product how does
that impact the users perception or
experience or quality you know when
you're getting yeah so I think that you
know a lot of people will take a case
off and buy it out and you take into the
box you say wow this thing feels really
sturdy and most the time that's based on
weight they pick it up and it's heavy
they go oh this is very expensive and if
it's light they go oh this is the
opposite the opposite is actually kind
of true which is that like it's not so
much weight is it about the the rigidity
so the torsional rigidity like if you
take a case like this and you try and
twist it like then you actually see how
well it's manufactured and how strong it
is right and that's basically cuz it's
basically a big cube with a motherboard
tray that acts as the support so the
motherboard tray is actually a really
critical support element in most modern
chassis cuz it's fastened to the top the
back in the bottom and sometimes even
the front of the case so it acts as kind
of the main frame that everything
connects to and then the corners have
you know rivets or screws to hold
everything together right and then the
side panels once they're on act as kind
of another way to keep the thing
torsionally structurally sound
so if you have for example a really
really thin steel case some of the
really really cheap stuff you can find
like these $20 cases or with like point
4 or 5 or 0.5 millimeter steel which is
really really flexible like you could
easily bend it with your hands those
cases even with the side panels on
they're not very structurally sound if
you go up to 0.6 0.8 1.0 you'll see that
structural rigidity improve a lot and
especially if things you want to do
put on this case for example we have a
steel front over this plastic frame that
then snaps onto another steel chassis
part so it's actually like a multi-layer
it's like steel plastic steel and this
one has sound and being in the middle of
that too so that multi-layer has a lot
of structural rigidity makes it feel
really solid for like the spec alpha we
have that big plastic mold on the front
and top or like something like an NZXT
phantom case with a big plastic anything
with a lot of plastic on it it's really
important to make sure that the
structural of the structure of the case
is solid underneath so you don't have
huge panel gaps and things like that
which is like you know here in this case
this consistent panel gap across here
this is really important too for a level
of quality and consistency right so you
know this level of panel gap here is
really critical any case where you have
a lot of different pieces meeting
together especially in here with a front
door for example where that door has to
open and close and you still want that
same panel gap top and bottom assuming
with cars
you know the panel gaps in the the hood
and the doors and the whole line should
be consistent throughout the case and
through the car so we kind of look at it
that way so that's all largely affected
by tooling then yeah so it's it's not
just tooling but also manufacturing and
tolerance gaps so there's a thing it's
called a kind of a taunt stack right so
if the base level which is your chassis
steel top something like at s340 has one
standard stamped three stamped piece of
steel on top that's it it's stamped
piece of steel and it's painted right
and that's a very easy thing because
it's once is one piece of steel it's
cheap it's easy to do and you're done if
you add something on top of that like
for let's say this thing right this has
a stamped steel piece on top but it also
has this dust filter here right so it's
important because we wanted to have this
magnetic dust filter this has to fit in
an inlay so we had to stamp that in way
into that we had to make sure that when
we cut this and we we have the magnets
in here they fit onto a point in there
where it sits flush and then we had to
make sure that the it's consistent so
that when we make this in six months
it's the same as if we make it today and
the tool has to be made to a certain
level of quality so the tool doesn't
wear down over time and
and everyone will wear down at some
point the higher end tools will last for
years the cheaper ones could last a
couple months and so depending on how
well this is all done you could have
cases that launch really well and then
end up with craft quality six months
later or cases that you know much really
well and there's still the same quality
years later so and then that's all very
expensive to do so if you're gonna
custom tool a chassis from the ground up
where you take every piece completely
and tool it up like these two cases were
done completely custom that can be
literally hundreds of thousands or a
million dollars you know to tool up
something so I mean for example I don't
know for a fact but I was told that the
HP Blackbird case that HP had a couple
years back that case I heard was like
almost three million dollars in tooling
the foot alone is like a $200,000 cast
aluminum part you know so it's like just
a tool that part it's not cheap we don't
have that kind of a three million dollar
tooling budget or anything but these are
definitely hundreds of thousands to you
know up to a million bucks of tooling
like a 900 d is a very expensive case to
tool there's a lot of parts the primary
cost of the tooling is part counts so
how many parts are in the case is kind
of how much this ruling will cost and
then how come Plex the tooling is how
many stages of stamps and things like
that the next and so the the goal is to
reduce the number and so do what you
need to do in as few steps as possible
so simplify and make things easier and
basic so that we don't have to spend you
know six hundred thousand dollars to
make every new case you know and so
that's why we use the same chassis for a
lot of different cases so once we 12 a
good custom chassis like the 400 C and
400 Q share the same exact case but in
the next three four years you might see
five or six different cases based off
this skeleton so we use this kind of
called a mannequin approach when we
build a mannequin and we dress it up
with different things right the spec
awful is a good example we use the spec
Oh two no three chassis and took out the
optical drive base tweaked a little bit
of the tooling so we spent a little bit
of money the tools some parts of the
inside and completely new plastic front
and side panels and feet that was a lot
cheaper than doing the whole thing from
scratch very cool so that's an inside
look at tulane manufacturing more than
you ever wanted to know
about really boring stuff that I spent
the last six years of my life working on
but very cool and perfect fit for the
channel as always thank you for watching
