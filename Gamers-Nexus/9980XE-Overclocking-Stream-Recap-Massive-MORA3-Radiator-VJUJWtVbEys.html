night Exe featured this which is a
gigantic radiator that has for 200
millimeter fans on one side we could
have done four on the other but we
didn't have a mounting bracket for
another four fans so we put four 140 s
on the back for 200 on the front so
we're doing here today is walking you
through the bench if you missed the
stream where you need to recap walk
through the final results of our
overclocking efforts with the 90 DXE
because of course the ultimate goal the
question we asked at the beginning of
the stream was compared to the 79 80 DXE
which you can deal it and get decent
thermals and overclocks with can you
achieve a similar clock to the 70 80
actually deleted with a 90 90 DXE with
solder with a reasonable cooling
solution not something crazy like dry
ice or liquid nitrogen so we went with
something that you can fit inside of a
computer case provided you remove all
other components in the case before that
this video is brought to you by
iBUYPOWER and the rush delivery to you
program the fresh rdy approach gets
high-end gaming pcs shipped the same day
you order them and it's also one of the
only places you can get a ninety nine
hundred k for a reasonable price right
now systems include the rdy enthusiast
level gaming pc with a 20 80 TI 900k and
16 gigabytes of 32 hundred megahertz
memory available with same-day shipping
or pick up locally these systems are
built by people who are experienced
builders and component choice that makes
sense
learn more at the link in the
description below what we ended up with
then this is the obviously the showpiece
here even ignoring the $2000 CPU behind
it this is more interesting right now
and that's because we've never worked
with this before so this radiator we
showed it at a pax event previously I
think and the company is called water
cool they largely work in Europe but I
think they're expanding their US
presence and so what irk will makes this
this is called the Mora mo - are a I
guess mo radiator or something and this
is the more of 420 it is big enough to
fit nine 140 millimeter fans on each
side you can do 18 if you wanted or four
144 to hundreds on each side with an
adapter which is what we did just just
because it's kind of interesting so this
is less air pressure than we would get
with 18 140 s but it's better for a live
stream it's bit quieter and honestly the
thermals were completely fine anyway so
on our max overclock result we ended up
with let's see we were in about the 80s
4 5 gigahertz on six cores at one point
three eight volts that's really good
said to be not deleted where liquid
metal is superior here just because it's
a thinner interface but solder is easier
to work with especially we start doing
things like dry ice because with dry ice
start going sub-zero that much you need
their own place you can't use liquid
metal liquid metal is really it gets
better as the heat increases so as you
reduce temperature it gets worse so
solder should be superior as we reduce
the temperature and drive it down really
far but for this thing we're about 80
degrees for 5.06 core with one point
three eight volts which is crazy good
and all of that is thanks to the cooling
solution so other than this thing which
is just fun to work with it is also I
don't know how thick is this the whole
thing there we go in millimeters is
sixty five millimeters or so that's
counting the frame it's a bit smaller
for the actual tubing as for surface
area so it's obviously fairly thick the
surface area though it's about 33 square
feet and that's because all the fins of
course in here have surface area so if
you took out every single piece of metal
all the fins and all the pipes and you
just laid it out in a square on the
floor it'd be about six by six five five
point seven by five point seven square
root of 33 so very large radiator is the
point I'm getting at it's also really
heavy and for that reason we're not
really concerned about it going anywhere
cuz it's I mean you would have to try to
push it over it we did mounted on some
feet here I think it has a wall mounting
kit I don't know how far it spaces it
from the wall but I think it's got a
wall mounting kit I think dare bauer was
working on like one case at Gamescom
that he showed that might accommodate
this but realistically you're probably
using it externally and interestingly
you can use this for passive cooling of
about 200 watts so we'll be looking at
that later but anyway this is hooked up
to something that is much more than 200
watts we're doing over 500 watts for our
99 ATX e last night for the rest of the
system other than the really interesting
radiator we have the EK water blocks
dual d DC pump we've used this in the
past we use this for the rip J stream
where we had
the ice bucket and so that's got two
pumps in it in and out hooked up I
labeled those so outs going into the
radiator at the bottom and then it comes
out of the radiator at the top over
there and then it comes into the block
comes out of the block goes into into
the reservoir and then into the pump
again an ek reservoir as well I don't
know how big that is but so that's our
setup for liquid cooling we have some QD
C's connected these are quick
disconnects these are used for just if
we want to dunk it an isolator it'll
make it easier to extend the tubing
length for that and then for the rest of
the system what we have is an EVGA X 299
dark motherboard that we've we've been
using this for 100% of our X 299
overclocking livestreams because it's
just it's it's one of the easiest boards
to work with for overclocking at this
level not great for stock usage as we
found out because it doesn't really run
things at stock but very good for
overclocking and so that's got on it a
kit of g.skill Trident II black memory
thirty-six hundred megahertz the memory
we've been using this memory since
repeal TT with a Titan B we use it again
with rip J we've used it for all the
high overclock streams and if for sure
does 4000 megahertz but we couldn't get
it there last night just stability
issues part of its on the platform side
the motherboard part of it is on maybe
the IMC but more likely the issues on
the motherboard side we're looking into
it a bit even though it's held those
clocks before because the issue is
really at 4000 megahertz the tertiary
timings and so the unsurfaced timings
just get all crazy and screwy
and if you don't manually tune them or
you can't in the case of the unsurfaced
ones then you basically just have to
keep retrying boot until it rains and it
works and we didn't have the patience
for that last night because it was a
stream so and I put 38 hundred megahertz
on this CL 15 and then had a 264 refresh
cycle which is pretty good maxed out the
Refresh interval as always and then also
pushed Tifa F aw for active window we
had at 38 we can't get it lower
unfortunately and then we had several
other timings
most of the small tertiary timings and
unimportant secondary times right like
four or six so that gives you an idea
for the memory settings the block we
should show this off to we will have
some b-roll of this so the block
heat killer for Seaview block which is
just it's really it's got a lot of mass
of copper in one spot and that has a
dense array of micro fins and it's that
helped with keeping our temperatures low
last night vrm is cooled by the EVGA
dark fans that are built in and then
we've got the yellow and black cables
hooked up so I could run a current clamp
on this during the live stream which is
how we to get live feeds of the power
consumption about 500 plus watts for
video card the video card is running
really hot idle which I guess is just
what RT X does but the video card is an
RT X xx atti FTW three that got
basically zero use we've got one of the
best video cards you can get right now
it didn't get used at all because we
were just doing times by CPU
overclocking and our objective was about
twelve thousand four hundred points
because that was what we got with an
ice-cold 79-80 XC with liquid metal and
we ended up at a bit over twelve
thousand we're at 12,000 138 which is
extremely good because this wasn't on
ice is just on air it's on as I said a
completely reasonable cooling solution
that anybody could use a set of 4 200
millimeter fans so didn't use ice on
this one not quite something you'd put
in your case to be realistic but pretty
damn good and for the clocks what you
were all wondering about 12-thousand 138
how does that 5.0 on six cores which is
really good
1.3 eight volts we have room for more if
we want to do it and our memory already
went ran through those settings we had
one point eight five which turned out to
be one point eight four so on this
motherboard for the memory we ran SI at
one point one eight five IO at one point
three of you at one point two we had
mesh at 32x and that can go probably to
30 through maybe thirty four and I think
that runs through most of the settings
we had so the rest of the cores were at
four point nine for clarity on that
so really fun set up to work with power
supply should go through just because
the power consumptive so I a X 1600 I
for that and then we had a that's a
corsair power supply we had a coarser
fan controller in there as well
commander pro and not really a fan
of the fan control software but it is it
is necessary to use this device and we
just used it because I mean that's a lot
of fans and they're kind of far away
from the system so we just routed them
all into one controller essentially I
think you control the speeds for this
stream so it wasn't too loud for anyone
during the stream because if we max it
out it gets gets quite loud as I can
show off
so
as I was saying if you max it out it
gets pretty loud most of that noise is
from the 3000 rpm knocked to a fan it's
it's a server grade fan basically so
yeah lots of fun in the stream thank you
for joining in if you joined and here's
your recap I mean it's 5.06 core much
better than what we got in the review we
were stuck at 4.4 ish in the review we
could kind of do four point six but it
required so much voltage 1.25 volts to
stay stable that it was just it was
overheating and her getting clock drops
which put it as worse than the 78 exe
with liquid metal so that was our big
hand up in the review is it's just it's
not as good as dee-lighted 79 AD XE from
purely a thermal standpoint that said we
think this CP is probably a better bin
so if that turns out to be true we just
need to get a colder to get theirs to
really stretch the clocks and with the
current set up we can do that pretty
well it's it's about where ours was the
difference in points here at this point
is primarily going to be the memory
settings because we were faced with
tertiary timing issues so very good CPU
once it's under almost ice technically
we put an ice cube in the reservoir by
popular demand and yeah it'll be it'll
be good once we put it under literal ice
but still recommending the 790 DX e
deleted if you're going for enthusiast
overclocking and and you're looking at
these two chips obviously we're ignoring
like everything else in the market which
are probably more sensible purchases in
a lot of cases but if you need to high
frequency and high core count you can
get it with a 90 90 d XP of the semi 980
X II it's just a question of what are
you going to do with it physically if
you're gonna mod it and get the 790 to
exceed and if not then this one's better
stock I guess check the review for more
on that but thank you for watching
stored out gamers exit sign out to help
us out directly and big shout out to all
of you who bought stuff during the
