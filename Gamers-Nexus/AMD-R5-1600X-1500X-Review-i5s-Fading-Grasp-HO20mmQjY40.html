since the initial are seven reviews note
that we ran a risin revisit series which
found game updates had improved gaming
performance in some titles we'll be
including that data in our new tests
alongside Intel retests for the same
game also in case you missed it our VR
benchmark for the r7 versus Ison prize
our first in-depth virtual reality test
of the rift and vibe will be performing
similar tests for the r5 CPUs this week
for now though we're reviewing the r5
1600 X and 1500 X CPUs in the risin
family it priced at 250 and $190
respectively before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by the 1080
FC which has a new MSRP that is it
lowered with the launch of the 1080 TI
series at 1080 and 10 tick the SC cards
come with for honor or Ghost Recon
wildlands which you can choose that
check out learn more at the link in the
description below
just to recap everyone on the horizon at
7:00 revisit content we tested a few
things there standalone EFI updates
which yielded no performance benefit
without taking advantage of the higher
memory frequency permitted by those EFI
updates we tested the higher memory
frequencies up to 30 466 at the time
that we can now hit 3,600 on some
platforms more on that later and then we
also tested Windows updates standalone
which yielded no performance benefit
going from be 693 to be 970 didn't
magically fix things in fact it was the
game updates which happened to coincide
with the windows update that actually
improves performance and for total war
Warhammer that was noteworthy for
battlefield 1 there was a performance
uplift these performance uplifts also
applied to Intel which we have now
partially retested well note in the
charts which ones haven't been retested
yet so we've got that we retested Rison
7 for this benchmark of our fives just
as a note so these are not recycled
numbers from the original review and we
have the EFI update on the crosshair 6
along with 3200 megahertz
memory at 4 risin 5 for the horizon 7
retest in gaming but for these
synthetics and blender we're still on 29
33 megahertz for the RS 7s we're on 3200
for the our five and then Intel has
remained
the frequency is defined in the article
link in the description below which
contains all the test notes and some
additional tests in the synthetic and
gaming categories we've got the CPU
specs on the screen now at least the
basics these 1600 X is a 6 chord 12
thread part with a 3.6 gigahertz at base
frequency and 95 watt TDP at $250 the r5
1500 X our other review part is a four
core eight thread unit at 2.5 gigahertz
base we don't yet have the r5 1400 on
this chart or r5 1600 cpus and because
of these new our 5 CPS are still using 2
CC X's just with some of the core is
disabled that means memory frequency
will still matter here when the Infinity
fabric as the AMD calls it lags behind
in cross CCX transactions so memory
speed will still matter quite a lot for
our 5 CPUs it's not just in our seventh
in because we're not looking at a single
CCX for these units it's two of them for
the most part with cores disabled that
noted the methodology as always we
linked in the description below in the
article we have updated that with our
rise and revisit info the VR stuff is
coming shortly a bit later from this
because it needs to be a completely
standalone video it's very in-depth
stuff and then a final note here we are
adding error bars to some of the charts
here it was added for our VR tests
people liked them a lot so we're going
to go ahead and continue a pilot run of
adding the error bars they are
calculated over multiple passes so we
take all of the data we've collected
over the past year or two really and
calculate the error calculate margin of
error calculate the standard deviation
all that stuff look at it statistically
and determine what is the variance test
to test either from a game from the OS
or whatever other variables are involved
in the system thermal testing on the r5
1600 X shows that using our crack in X
62 cooler we're not in danger of
encountering a clock throttle under
torture workloads at any point during
this test this was not true
for some of the previous rise in CPUs
like the 1800 X and our 7 1700 X units
which had high V core out of the box and
a higher temperature as a result the 70
100 M 1600 X however are able to keep a
flat clock when under thermal torture
test including the 1500 X by the way the
sporadic lines at the front of the chart
illustrate X F hour prior to test
execution if you're curious we're still
working on running separate thermal
tests for Rison and we'll be publishing
a complete standalone piece that
completely defines thermals we've worked
with AMD on this as well as others and
that will hopefully put forward a
complete picture of what Rison looks
like for temperatures because it's been
very confusing thus far as for voltages
and power the 1600 x drives about the
same power from the wall as all the
other rising ships expectedly as of the
1500 x under a blender multi-threaded
workload the 1600 x stock cpu clock set
2.7 gigahertz across all cores when
working concurrently on all those
threads and that runs the core voltage
of that 1.17 to 1.2 power draw is 145
watts constant with this workload
compared to the 123 watts constant on
the r5 1500 X same workload with its 2.6
gigahertz speed and 1.2 to 1.2 for V
core Auto controlled compared to levy
1800 X to about 185 watts in the same
test with a 1700 X drawing 168 and 1700
stock CPU trying to 133 pre overclock
now if you overclocked it it'd be a bit
more and it would also equal the
performance of the 1700 X and 1800 X
CPUs let's move on the competitive
benchmarks starting with blender premier
and then move on to gaming we're running
our blender tests using release
candidate ready settings with 400
samples per pixel and 16 by 16 tiles
this is the optimal use case for blender
with CPU rendering and one with which
we're familiar from our own animations
that we rendered in-house for the
channel as is known a blender cares the
most about threads and so there should
be significant differences between the
are 512 thread and 8 thread chips here
despite likely minimal differences a
clock for clock in game we're seeing the
r5 1500 X stock renders the 4k scene and
fifty five and a half minutes faster
than the overclocked I 570 600 K by
about seven minutes that's an 11 percent
reduction in total render time the next
closest CPU is the i7 2604 points having
gigahertz which completes the render in
fifty four and a half minutes really
showing Sandy Bridge is proud
us here in overclocking the 1500 X 2 4
gigahertz leapfrogs the 2600 k OC
landing at 50 points seven minutes at
which point we're in Devil's Canyon i7
territory
these 1600 x stock leverages its extra 4
threads here completing the render in
thirty six point eight minutes compared
to the 1500 x stock that's a render time
reduction of 33.6% note here that our r7
CTS haven't yet been rerun at 3200
megahertz
though you can see the memory benefit
between the 29:33 1700 x OC and the 1700
x OC 134 66 megahertz that should allow
some extrapolation it's not as important
and this type of test as in some of the
others price the performance intel's I 5
CPUs don't stand up here the i5 7600 K
overclocked to 4.7 gigahertz finishes
its render in 62 and a half minute the
r5 1600 X overclocked to 4 gigahertz
finishes in 32.7 minutes
that's a render time reduction of 46
percent for roughly the same price if
you actually do plan to do some CP bound
rendering the r5 and our 7 chips remain
as we have said from the get-go achieve
consideration at the price let's look to
Adobe Premiere video rendering
benchmarks now we've included cuda
accelerated benchmarks as well just to
provide perspective for users who prefer
cuda accelerated rendering to software
rendering we are rendering an EVGA icx
review from the 1080 ftw2 that we
uploaded on the channel so that includes
some features like color correction some
warp stabilization things like that in
there we're running with a GPU for the
1600 X 5900 k8 hundred and seventy six
hundred K all of which land within a few
minutes of each other when using the GPU
to render so the extra threads on the
CPU don't help a whole lot in fact
generally having a higher frequency
helps keep the CPU up with the GPU but
overall we are no more than a few
minutes apart
even from the 7600 K to the 6900 K
looking instead the CPU rendering the r5
1500 X finishes the render in 114 to 126
minutes depending on the overclock which
is 22.7% behind the 12 thread r5 1600 X
at 84 minutes compared to an r7 1700
overclocked which we still think is the
best buy of the r7 family the
overclocked r5 at 1600
is about 28% slower if you want to see
more benchmarks we have pov-ray
Cinebench time spy and fire strike on
the website link for the description
below and those contain additional
synthetic tests battlefield 1 is one of
the games where we saw performance to
uplift following the recent patch 1.08
which improves performance on both
Verizon and Intel CPUs by the way our
eyes and revisit showed r7 uplift but
did not revisit the Intel CPUs at that
time for this review we've read
benchmarks the i7 7700 case ah can
overclock somebody sick kind of case
tockman overclock and the i5 2500 cpu
other Intel CPUs have not been retested
in this title and will so place a few
percentage points lower on the charts
than if they were retested this is just
a matter of time limitations at this
point all AMD chips and the most
relevant Intel chips have been retested
on the 1.08 build of them in the FX
series the AMD r5 1500 X places on the
chart at 126 FPS average with low is at
81% low and 63 0.1% lows surrounding the
1500 X the Intel i5 4690k runs at 132
FPS average with 83 fps 1% low and 72
0.1% lows this plants at the 4690k about
4.3 percent ahead of the 1500 X when
both are stock the 1500 X outperforms
the i5 35 70k Ivy Bridge CPU which runs
around 125 FPS average and the i5 2500
k1 overclocked around 124 FPS average
the i5 7500 CPUs and these closer price
competition from this generation for the
1500 X and that operates at around 138
FPS average 87 and 77 fps lows that
lands the i5 7500 about 9% ahead of the
1500 x with a $10 increase in available
price the i3 72 50k further reinforces
our initial reviews point that although
the unlocked I 3 CPU is really cool from
the perspective of being an unlocked i3
CPU $180 price point doesn't make much
sense and that holds true when looking
at both these 7500 and the r5 1500 X the
7500 or 1500 X both make way better suns
in this price gap looking at the r5 1600
X now the CPU plays
at 135 FPS average with lows at 98 and
86 just behind the r7 1700 stock CPU
this proves that games don't much care
for the extra cores in fact you'd most
often be better off losing some threads
and just overclock in a cheaper chip if
gaming is the desire overclocking the
1600 X gets the CPU up to 136 FPS
average at 4.0 8 gigahertz I was clocked
quite high which was right around where
the 1700 X up 2.9 gigahertz 3466 my
cards memory landed given a $150 price
disparity between the two if gaming is
your thing the 1600 X effectively
invalidates the 1700 X and 1800 X in
this title we'll have to look at others
for a better understanding though now
the update didn't only benefit AMD Intel
vy5 7600 K also saw uplift now placing
at 144 FPS stock with 146 FPS
overclocked battlefield 1 doesn't seem
to care too much with our settings that
lands the i5 7600 K stock around 7%
ahead of the 1600 X stock with lows
effectively equal the overclocked 7600 K
is also roughly 7% ahead of the
overclocked 1600 X moving the total war
Warhammer this is another game where
game updates not Windows updates as some
people seem to think originally provided
improvement for AMD CPUs upon running
retest we also saw performance uplift on
loads Intel CPUs and we've designated
the CTS that re tested with an asterisk
CP is lacking the asterisk word
potentially see some performance uplift
if retested by 770 700 K is running into
an external constraint as indicated by
the lack of the overclock scaling this
is a limitation elsewhere in the bench
and you can see that by looking at the
positive scaling in between the 7600 K
and its overclocked Experion this means
that a rough 190 FPS is our performance
ceiling in this bench course with our
config our 5 1500 X stock averages 142
FPS with lows at 85 and 73 this place is
the r5 1500 X ahead of the overclocked
i7 2604 point 7 gigahertz running an
average of 130 F guess with lows at 95
and 89 and markedly ahead of the i3 72
50k in frame time performance by
comparison the stock I 5 7500 a locked
CPU performs at around 150
FPS average with lows at 94 and 85
thanks to Lee's update before the update
the CPU struggled with low-end phantom
performance the 7500 leads of the 1500 X
an average frame rate by roughly 11% the
7500 also leads an average at
milliseconds between frames but as this
frame time chart shows the difference is
imperceptible to the end-user we're
talking 85 versus 73 for the one percent
slowest frames here not a huge
difference at that point overclocking
the 1500 X gets the CPU to 151 FPS
average closing ground on the 7500 the
1500 X outperforms of stock 1,700 X and
1700 at once overclocked and is
effectively equivalent in average frame
rate to the 1600 X despite a slight
frame time disparity the r5 1600 X stock
performs equivalent to the 1800 X stock
aiding the overclocked 1700 and further
challenging the existence of the 1800 X
for our audience to 1600 X overclocked
to 4.08 gigahertz outperforms the stock
r7 CPUs all of them and is effectively
equal in averages to the i5 7500 though
outperforms the 7500 significantly in
low values by way of comparison the
overclocked i5 7600 K is about 15.6
percent ahead of the r5 1600 X
overclocked and averages with low is
more or less equal the non overclocked I
570 600 K does worse in lows at than the
r5 1600 X stock but the average is
maintained at 174 versus 151 fps
favoring Intel watchdogs 2 has proven
itself to be more reliance on thread
counts than other games on the bench to
some extent but does still care about
clock speeds it's just that the i7 CPU
is post a distinct advantage over the i5
CPUs and so we should expect to see the
same scaling or similar with Rison the
r5 1500 X stock Seaview performs
effectively equally to the i5 4690k
Devil's Canyon CPU and outperforms the
i3 7350 KF 5 gigahertz this again
further proves that the i3 73 50k at its
price is really not a good deal in just
the same way that the more affordable
Rison chips are effectively invalidating
the 1800 x in gaming
considering overclocks the 1800 X $500
doesn't make sense for gaming when you
can buy an r5 overclock it and get the
same or very similar performance versus
the price Comparative i5 7500 we're
looking at a frame rate of 80 FPS
average on the 7500 9k CPU with the
overclocked 1500 X at 3,200 megahertz
Ram landing at 75 FPS average
considering the price difference and
production advantage assuming your on
mixed workloads this closing distance
places the r5 chip in the best price to
performance brackets of AMD's current
offerings moving to the r5 1600 X this
CPU lands at 84 FPS average or about 15%
ahead of the stock 1500 X overclocked in
the 1600 x gets it beyond 1800 x stock
levels just below the overclocked I 720
609 the i5 7600 K 4.7 gigahertz tests a
93 FPS average the 7600 K overclocked
holds the lead of about 5% over the
overclocked 1500 X stock to stock we're
looking at a performance lead of
effectively zero percent the 72nd K and
1600 X are equal when they are both
stock and moving now to Metro last light
useful as it hasn't been updated in
years which is nice we see an
interesting scenario that resembles the
total war Warhammer
game scenario is just a few weeks ago by
5 CPS have trouble in frame time
consistency with this game they always
have and we've shown that for years at
this point and disabling hyper threading
on i7 CPUs reinforces that though they
do okay and averages r5 1500 Xbox TV
performs are 113 FPS average with loads
at 78 and 63 this is similar to the
stock i7 2670 Bridge CPU in both frame
times and averages overclocking the 1500
X 2 4 gigahertz lands its performance
right around where the stock r7 1706 by
5 7500 CPU operates an average of 114
FPS with sporadic enough frame times to
result in 30fps 0.1% low values the r5
1600 X meanwhile is effectively equal to
an R 7 1700 ax and performance showing
that for games where thread count isn't
as relevant which is most of them
there's not much tangible gain from an
extra 4 threads on Rison the i5 7600 k
overclocked and that's an
FPS that is higher but reflects the same
sporadic frame time performance as the
other chips discuss Intel Core i7 chips
meanwhile maintain a healthy lead in
Metro last light including the i7 2604
point 7 gigahertz let's just take them
out and point that chip out again we did
it revisit recently and it's holding on
very well the r5 chips look good in this
benchmark when compared to the price
equivalent I 5 chips from Intel
this first Ash's benchmark shows the old
version of the game the next chart will
show the escalation updates which has
fewer data points but it has been tested
to some extent ashes of the singularity
with high settings plants the r5 1500 x
stock at about 26 point 6 FPS average 19
1% was in 1801 percent blows this is
effectively identical to the i7 2670
performance overclocking the r5 1500 x2
4 gigahertz doesn't really gain much
ground moving 228 FPS average and we
proved in our previous rise and revisit
piece that Ash's cares a whole lot more
about memory overclocked than core
overclocked if you wanted a high mark in
this game if you better off investing
your time in memory than core we've left
our 34 66 megahertz r7 1700 X overclocks
on this chart to illustrate that that
you should check the rise and revisit
content for a better understanding
compared to modern CPUs the Intel i5
7500 performs at 26.4 FPS average with
lows from 18 to 20 this is again
effectively identical to the 1500 X
stock CPU the r5 1600 X is a little more
interesting performing within 1.4 FPS of
the i5 7600 k stock overclocking both be
7600 K and 1600 X maintains a similar
gap the i5 7600 K is now at around 32
point 6 FPS average with the r5 1600 X
around 33 point 4 FPS average more
interestingly the r5 1600 X overclocked
performs it roughly equally to an r7 18
or deck stock even with the same memory
speed again this further emphasizes our
point that the r7 1800 X is a bad buy
for gaming at the price if you are
building a pure gaming machine as stated
previously you're best off with either
Intel the r7 1700 or now one of the r5
chips we'll talk about this more in the
conclusion though the 1700 and 1800 X
as shown in this game and so the others
don't offer very good value for game
performance particularly when it
considering overclocking the r5
we haven't retested everything in Ash's
escalation at this point it's more AMD
heavy than Intel heavy right now since
we just started running these tests with
the r5 CPUs the 1500 X is now around 29
FPS average with lows in the 19 to 21
range this is effectively equal to the
i5 7500 again the r7 cpus were iran here
but we haven't put the 1600 x3 just yet
there's no argument here that for the
price Rison is the best competitor for
render workloads on the cpu so GPU
accelerated rendering does still serve
as somewhat of an equalizer when looking
at even i5 r 5 sr 7s and i7 as we show
with the cuda accelerated premier
benchmarks so if you use compatible
benchmarks with GT rendering keep that
in mind if CPU rendering is you're thin
then Rison 5 is well ahead of same price
I 5 CPUs from Intel for gaming Intel
ties in some games like watchdogs 2 or
rather an D ties Intel as it is the
Challenger here and Intel is about seven
to 15 percent ahead in other games
averaging about seven to ten anything
more than that is less common but does
happen and Andy in this way has closed
the gap significantly compared to its r7
vs. i7 launch that we already looked at
so to that end it looks like r5 offers
an even stronger argument for users who
legitimately plan to do some sort of
mixed production workloads and when I
say that what we're talking about is
looking at things like someone who might
do some content creation for YouTube
maybe twitch or whatever animation in
addition to doing some gaming if you're
not doing any animation any production
on your pure gaming we have some notes
for you later in this conclusion now
with regard to frame times and these are
five at CPU is that worst roughly equal
to Intel i5 CPU and at best a good deal
ahead in games like Metro last light or
pre update total war Warhammer though
the update has shown that yes game
updates can significantly improve frames
on consistency on CPUs even when it's
two different vendors and Intel in this
case extra threads help over the i5 CPU
is but don't really do a whole lot for
you over the
70 PS so the extra four or so threads in
our seven really not a whole lot of gain
versus the r5 if you're looking at
similar clock scenarios or overclocking
over i-5 it is relevant
just like the i7 over i-5 is relevant it
seems that 18 sweep out where it matters
and also seems to be about where it
stops in terms of relevance for the
extra or high thread count CPUs if
you're purely gaming and not looking in
three hundred plus dollar territory it's
looking like are five CPUs are close
enough to i-5 to really justify a
purchase if only because the frame times
are either equal to competitive i-5
chips in price or at least slightly
ahead if not a good deal ahead depending
on the game now the citizens are always
visible as we've mentioned a few times
now if you're looking at 70 versus 85
when you're talking up the slowest 1% of
frames that's not necessarily visible or
perceptible to the user but it's a
significant enough difference that it
can matter ensures that it does matter
in some game if you are looking at
something like an r5 1600 X overclocking
it would more or less invalidate a lot
of the r7 purchases for pure gaming that
does not hold true if you're doing
something like blender alongside gaming
but if you're pure gaming the r7 CPUs
even the 1700 which we've liked do not
really make a whole lot of sense when
you can get a competitive or comparable
r56 core 12 thread or something like
that and overclock it those games won't
really leverage the extra threads for
the most part though render tasks will
so it just depends on what you're doing
the 1600 X / the 1700 would save you
some money and we would strongly
recommend taking that money and putting
it toward better Ram because as we've
shown in our rise and revisit getting
something like 34 60 or six megahertz
memory or 3600 and I don't just mean the
kits that you can buy you have to
actually put in a lot of work to get
there and make sure it's Samsung B die
there are a lot of requirements here so
it's not just biotin it works but if you
can get it working it makes more sense
to put the money towards the memory
because faster memory with your 70 or
$80 savings from an r5 over an hour
seven CPU would put you further ahead
than just getting an r7 CPU with lower
price for the memory now that said you
have to be careful not to venture into
AI 777 hunt a territory with your price
as soon as you're putting so much money
into the r5 platform memory and all of
that that you're rivaling i7 territory
and you're only gaming it's looking like
the i7 7700 K is still the best gaming
chip out of the ones we've tested and
that is done with thirty-two hundred
megahertz memory quite easily so yes I
5cq still provide a decent experience
for gaming especially but even for
gaming it's starting to look like you're
either buying a 7700 K now because it is
significantly ahead of the r5 CPUs and
it's pretty well ahead of the r7 CPU or
if you're not buying the 7700 kctu
you're buying an r5 CPU we don't see
much argument for our 7s in gaming at
this point although there is an argument
in some cases and we also see a fading
arguments for i5 CPU s the current
juggernauts are interestingly the i7
7700 K at the top end and the r5 1600 ex
particularly with an overclock which is
quite easy to do if you're not pushing
memory very hard if you're already
settling for an i-5 from an i7 it's not
much of a jump to go to an r5 and ensure
better frame times going forward and the
average deficit is not that large 7 to
10 percent on average but you're still
in good range for playable frame rates
and the frame times hold on quite well
by 5 is still good CPU don't get us
wrong it's just not compelling enough
it's not as strong as the i7 is against
the r7 i7 poses a very strong defense to
the r7 in gaming going beyond 8 threads
doesn't do a whole lot for your gaming
experience but as we've shown numerous
times and i-5 reviews going beyond 4
threads does help in consistent frame
time delivery it's not required you can
still have a good experience without 8
threads in most games but this is
actually becoming a noticeable thing in
some titles that we test 16 threads
don't matter as much and won't anytime
soon but again it does and if you buy an
r5 overclocked it by decent memory it'll
be competitive with Intel just ganna be
wary of entering into seven
700k territory because at that point
you'd be better off buying the i7 one
final reminder here it's not just Coors
doing this if Coors were the only thing
that mattered the FX series would have
been a whole lot more competitive and
less of a blunder overall looking at
Coors is kind of a difficult thing to do
if you're just looking at the number a
core does not necessarily equal a core
when you're looking across architecture
that is troopers n this trooper
bulldozer that's true for Intel so when
we're looking at the core count people
always talk about having a lot of
threads available having eight threads
sixteen thread that's not all it is it's
having the threads available with an
architecture that supports them for the
task you are performing Verizon it's
looking like these extra threads eight
and onward are a whole lot more valuable
than they were on FX and that's because
of the architectural differences it's
because of extra floating-point focus
it's because of better AVX improvements
as we talked about in the r7 eighteen
hundred extra view in the article so
that's just kind of a thing it's not
just a core argument frequency matters
two threads matter but all of it comes
down to the architecture and how it
works together and then we have some
weird things like the Infinity fabric
and memory permitting some faster
transactions when looking across you see
X so every architecture has its own
quirks that's all for this one though
hopefully that really sums it up for
everyone check back soon for our

that will be on the channel shortly
