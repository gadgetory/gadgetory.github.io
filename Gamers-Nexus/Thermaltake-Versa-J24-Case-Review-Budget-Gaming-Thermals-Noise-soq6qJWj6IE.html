this is the Thermaltake verse at j24 it
comes in at about $70 plus or minus a
bit because you can get the a RGB
version which we don't have for an extra
couple bucks extra ten plus dollars but
we have the non a RGB version so it's
bit cheaper and that is generally a good
thing on our bench because we're looking
more at the value in this price range
for how well does it cool how well does
do acoustically versus nearby
competitors and then of course to some
extent how is the exterior and how is
the build quality so today we're looking
at thermal takes at J 24 and this is one
of the cases that was tucked away hidden
at a recent trade show so we'll see if
it was hidden for good reason or not
before that this video is brought to you
by the gigabyte ARS ad 27 QD gaming
monitor the ad 27 QT is a 27-inch 1440p
gaming display with 95% of dcpip 3 color
saturation for high color accuracy
accompanied by a 1 millisecond response
time 10 bit IPS panel and display HDR
visa certification
additional features include fluid
adjustment and slide RGB LEDs for
personal Flair and firmware features
like cooldown counters at reticles and
adaptive noise reduction
learn more at the link below so j24 a
RGB not this one we have RGB there's
this one last letter the a RGB version
and also a whole bunch of other new
commander series products we're at CES
this year and a lot of them were tucked
away in a back room which we were
fortunate enough to find because the
main product showcased was
water-cooled memory which is just let's
move on so the cases were hidden in the
back and it was actually it caught us by
surprise because the case is that
Thermaltake had hidden in the back we're
pretty damn good they're competitive and
a lot of them did have mesh fronts this
is one of the ones that has a bit of a
denser panel on the front but it is
still perforated for airflow more than a
lot of cases on the market so this
obviously caught our attention and we
spoke to thorough I'll take about it and
said you know you should you shouldn't
feel ashamed about trying to do things
with airflow and fans so anyway
hopefully we've talked some sense into
them and they'll show these things more
MORE
or proudly in the future but the j24
does have a couple of things that as you
dig into it you go well maybe it's not
quite as open air as we thought but
we'll see how it does in the thermal
section later in this video
for example this one has effectively two
filters there's the outer mesh which
isn't much of a filter it is a you know
two mesh and it's probably about 50%
metal still and then the intersection
got the honeycomb design just for
structural support and then there's a
really fine filter in there so when we
saw this with the g20 one another
thermal take case that we'll talk about
today what we found was that the g20 one
tripled up on filters and as a result
really hindered its ability to cool well
and then as he removes those filters one
by one the thermal performance improved
to a point where it became rather
competitive so this because it's
something that you can mostly achieve on
your own by pulling a few tabs and
pulling the filter out it's not such a
bad thing you just need to be aware of
the difference it makes thermally and
maybe spend some more time cleaning your
your case internally once you remove the
filter so we're gonna take that out
today and test and see how it does but
beyond that it does have three fans in
the front these are not particularly
high static pressure which will come
into play with the double filters here
later but three fans nonetheless and
they are RGB in this model there's an a
RGB one as I said elsewhere if you want
it there's one fan in the back it is
about the cheapest fan that Thermaltake
could possibly buy but it's still a fan
so you end up with four kind of lowish
and two maybe medium on the front and
fans can't have a medium end but you get
what I'm saying and that's not so bad
for $70 it starts to compete with the
likes of the RL 0-6 which has long been
a chart topper on our bench from
Silverstone and other cases in that
price category the fact all mesh by C is
another case that sells around this
price point fewer fans included but
still set up in a way that you can
really get it going for airflow if you
wanted to so it's it's $70 case it is
RGB folks that comes with the fans that
have RGB built in it's got a lot of
things that are popular right now and a
relatively low price now we just need to
talk about if it's actually any good so
where do you go through Patrick's build
notes and then we'll go through the
thermal section
there are I will note as just just a
prequel or precursor here Patrick is
fairly critical in the build section and
we are actually overall leaning slightly
positive on this case but there's a lot
of critical points to go through so
let's let's go through those now the
verse of Jay 2040 G RGB edition is a
budget case from thermaltake our
understanding is that the je 22 23 24
and 25 are basically the same chassis
with the same number of fans and
different front panels but trying to
remember thermal takes case Q's is a
great way to go crazy the sample they
send us for review specifically is the
RGB edition and not the newer a RGB
edition which may or may not have been a
mistake on thermal takes part but saving
$10 over an extra vowel is a win in our
book the case interior is just big
enough to fit an ATX motherboard with
little room to spare on any side but
there are adequate cutouts along the
front edge to route all the cables the
case is about as small as it can be
without entering Q 500l territory almost
exactly the same dimension as the Mesha
phi c but slightly longer cable
management room is understandably
restricted as a result of this there is
space under the power supply shroud but
users with one or more at 3.5 inch
drives will struggle to find place for
power cables the hard drive cage can be
removed or shifted 2.5 centimeters back
toward the rear of the case welcome
change from budget cases that usually
Ridge at the hard drive cage in place
the top of the power supplied shroud is
fully ventilated and includes two
mounting points for two and a half inch
drive sleds which can be placed behind
the motherboard as well that's where we
installed hours because the mounts on
the power supply shroud don't line up
with any cable cutouts to be usable at
all the SATA cables wouldn't need to be
plugged directly into the motherboard
instead of being routed neatly under the
shroud which is a minor deign against
the case the only major fit and finish
issue with the case was that it only had
7 motherboard standoffs installed and no
espares included will give Thermaltake
the benefit of the doubt and assume this
was a QC oversight and problem but the
manual confirms that there aren't any
extra standoffs included in the parts
kit in this case this happens but it
really
and it should have backups in case it
does the scene two of nine standoffs
with a full sized ATX board means that
some of the board is going to flex
unavoidably when components are
installed we have a dozens of extra
standoffs lying around so not really a
big deal but it could be an
inconvenience for first-time system
builders especially those with a bit
more OCD or need to do it the right way
than those who can get by without a
couple of extra screws the steel side
panel is held on with metal tabs a
mechanism as annoying as it is old it's
the kind with it loops instead of the
fragile little hooks at least so that's
one good side of it the glass side panel
however is much better it's got a couple
of metal strips glued to the edges that
hook over the chassis and are secured
with thumb screws at the back this is
probably cheaper than drilling holes in
the glass panel for the thumb screws the
process we showed in our tempered glass
factory tour and although relying on
glue is less secure technically it's
easier to use for the user and it's
unlikely to fail we haven't had one fail
yet the front panel is covered with the
same pill-shaped ventilation holes as on
the core g21
but backs with a sheet of foam to filter
out dust the effectiveness of the filter
is slightly undercut by a cutout under
the front panel which allows air
directly into the fans but since the
fans are mounted nearly flush with the
front panel most of the air is still
pulled through the front of the case the
resemblance of the front panel to the
g-20 one is ominous we criticized that
case we're using multiple redundant
filters that choked off the airflow the
j-20 fours approach makes a lot more
sense but it also blocks off a lot of
the incoming air as we'll discuss the
thermal section later the top of the
front panel is decoratively narrowed in
a way that seems like it would prevent
mounting 140-mile new fans but the panel
is still 140 millimeters wide at its
narrowest point although the 140
millimeter fan mounts don't extend all
the way to the top of the case the fan
LEDs are controlled externally by a
button on the front of the case labeled
are originally for reset but now for RGB
the power and RGB switches are under
either side of a single plastic button
which is sort of a bad choice and one
that can't be saving Thermaltake much
money or time it's not as bad as having
the power and reset switches under the
same button
as was the original intent but it's
still going to be annoying to hit the
wrong switch in the dark the fans use
the same five pin connector that we've
seen and complained about in the past
with Lian Li cases since they can't
connect to anything except the hub that
shifts the case thermal takes fan hub is
extremely simple to the extent that it
doesn't have any way to actually control
the speed of the fans which therefore
run at full rpm with no way to control
their speed short of soldering together
a four pin adapter the connections on
the hub are tailored exactly to the fans
that ship with the case and there are no
spare plugs the j-20 for ships with four
fans a massive improvement over the g20
ones a single fan despite our hang-ups
about how they're connected and
controlled the three intake fans are RGB
not a RGB on this case that's a
different skew but it does exist and
they can accept lighting input directly
from the fan hub or pass-through from a
compatible motherboard the foam filter
does have an interesting softening
effect on the lighting compared to a
more typical mesh front filter but the
metal and plastic elements on the front
panel also obscure the fans a good bit
the front of the case theoretically
supports up to three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiators but only tubes up
and there may be clearance issues with
the hard drive cage unless it's moved
back or taken out ignore any marketing
photos with a radiator mounted at the
top of the case Thermaltake doesn't even
try to claim that the top mount supports
radiators in their spec sheet since
there's only about three centimeters of
space between the motherboard and the
case there's room for one 120 millimeter
rear radiator and one 240 in the front
without any crowding though we followed
the standard test suite for the j24 was
just a couple of exceptions we gave up
almost immediately on trying to noise
normalize this system since the rear fan
is the only one that can be controlled
and is the quietest of the four the
front fans are not cross compatible with
the Lian Li at five pin fan controller
either despite using the exact same
connector and if users can't practically
lower the fan speed there's no point in
us trying to force that scenario for
testing we also added a test with a foam
filter layer removed see how much it
restricted the airflow and one final
test with the rear exhaust fan
controlled via the motherboard header
instead of the fan controller we won't
discuss that one too much because it's
within a half at the
for thermal results thermal testing will
start with just the Versa j24 case
results then will expand the charts
the CPU torture average temperature is
fifty seven point one degrees Celsius
over ambient which lowered massively
down to forty four point four degrees
delta T over ambient with the front
panel removed for a reduction of about
13 degrees Celsius the intake fans don't
deal well at all with the task of
drawing air through a foam filter and
through the front panel but if they're
unrestricted they do an excellent job of
pushing enough air through the case to
get it towards the top of the results
leaving the front panel on and remove
adjust the foam filter confirmed this
with the CPU temperature of forty eight
point eight degrees Celsius over ambient
almost as good as with no panel at all
users who aren't averse to cleaning
their cases should definitely consider
removing the dust filter in the front as
these fans aren't particularly good with
static pressure performance
comparatively fifty-seven point one
degrees stock isn't a completely
terrible score to begin with it's close
to the define as two levels of
performance but it's definitely on the
warm end of the scale and is especially
warm for the fan count it's certainly
not as good as we'd expect for a mesh
fronted case with four stock fans for
its placement the g twenty one with two
one forty millimeter intake fans added
in addition to the stock 120mm exhaust
fan and placed fifty one point eight
degrees delta t in this test and the j
twenty four would be read along sided if
it had either a less restrictive filter
or fans with higher static pressure if
you're willing to remove the front
filter performance improves
significantly and scales toward the very
top end of the chart GPU thermals for
the j 24 or next GP temperature was
fifty six point two degrees on average
in the torture test and it ii got much
cooler with the front panel removed
averaging forty eight point five degrees
over ambient this also gives us an
additional clock increase in boosting
behavior which is maybe notable in some
instances the ventilated power supply
shroud matters more here than it
typically does since the incoming air
from the lowest intake fan is directed
into the power supply shroud and has no
place to exit other than upwards
straight into the GPU cooler removing
the front filter and keeping the front
panel landed at the midpoint between the
two results at 52 degrees average again
removing the foam filter layer is a
valid option for users who don't mind
cleaning their GPU fans more than usual
fifty six point two degrees over
Amiens is comparatively worse than the
cpu temperatures were on the level of
the stock define r6 and definitely
hotter than it could be suggest in terms
of the stack versus other cases it's on
the warm side once again the g20 one
with two added fans also did nearly the
same here he's all teen and fifty six
point nine degrees over ambient but we'd
like to see the j-20 for closer to
something like the silverstone rlo six
or something similar 52 degrees without
the filter does put it on the level of
the stock age five hundred p mesh which
isn't bad but you do have to remove that
filter the fire strike extreme test
raise GPU temperature slightly above the
torture test results to fifty eight
point six degrees celsius over ambiens
putting it among the results of cases
where the GPU hits 82 to 83 degrees and
down clocks to maintain its temperature
it's not the worst GV temperature we've
seen with this bench but it absolutely
qualifies as hot because if we're
hitting 82 to 83 degrees it's really
sort of getting into unacceptable levels
it would be better if the filter weren't
so restrictive or if you just remove it
but then you do lose some of the dust
filtration this is a similar issue to
what we talked about with the g20 one
just not quite as bad we can't make our
usual comments about adding a fans
better cool the GPU either since
Thermaltake already has as many fans as
possible in the front of the case so you
just be replacing fans at this point
which is a valid option as seen in our
earlier test results with just the CPU
and just the GPU versus only the Versa
j24 results adding or changing the fans
the better ones doesn't prove
performance significantly blender
rendering on the CPU averaged thirty
eight point seven degrees Celsius over
ambient still in the middle of the chart
and next to the defined s to vision and
stock NZXT aged 500 if a case is going
to be running three to four fans at full
speed at all times no matter what it
should at least be cooling exceptionally
well it's not that the case performs
poorly stock it's that it should be
doing better and it can be rendered on
the GPU average twenty seven point eight
degrees Celsius over ambience equivalent
to the land cold one which is a case
that we haven't really mentioned in
months the bottom of the case is about
as good as it can be for GPU cooling
with the constraints of the case and
having a power slash shroud and a hard
drive cage but it's let down by the
front panel for noise up next we
measured the J twenty four thirty nine
point five DBA again there's no
way to control three of the four fans in
the case and the fourth one can't be
controlled either unless it's plugs into
the motherboard that means 39.5 DBA is
going to be the limiting noise level for
our test bench and this will change
based on your system but when you can't
control the fans there's definitely a
floor to how low your noise it can go
per Patrick's wording then and his
written review that's linked in the
description below I'll just quote him
directly it might not sound like it but
we actually like this case and the
reason that Patrick like this is because
it's it's 80 to 90 dollars supposed to
be a bit cheaper sometimes but currently
at current prices at the time of
recording this review it is 90 on new
egg which is overpriced it's 80 on most
other outlets and we've heard 70 is a
possibility as well so the a RGB version
is on sale on new egg for about $10 over
what they've got what this is supposed
to be price that's that $90 on new egg
typically a bit more 80 is a pretty good
price we'd like to see it again as it
falls closer to 1770 that's good but 80
it's not bad
for a case with four fans it's just that
the fans aren't particularly powerful
they they look kind of good if you're
into the RGB thing so there's some value
there for a lot of people and they
perform well enough but the case really
starts to push high towards the top of
the charts when you strip down the front
a bit so if you take that filter out it
is one of the better cases in its price
category it's up there not distant from
the RL 0/6 and some of our tests and
that's a good thing so if if you're
willing to sacrifice some of the dust
filtration in favour of performance the
case sets you up well for that it
separately the case is really small so
it's got that potentially going for it
as well it's not too far from the Q 500
LSI's it's bit bigger and it's very very
similar to the fractal master by C size
and this is a good category to target
because it's largely underserved other
than the size of the enclosure there is
there's one downside with that which is
that there's not particularly good
liquid cooling support but if you're
leaning towards spending glass out of
case you might be spending less on
cooling and probably getting air more
likely an example of where it's limited
is the top so Thermaltake does not
advertise top rated or support although
in some of their marketing photos
there's a radiator in there but it looks
like it surrender so don't don't go into
this planning to put it right on the top
you can get one in the front so it's got
some minimal level of liquid coin
support you do a small like 120 in the
back depending make sure you double
check but depend of the radiator so it's
not particularly good in that regard but
it's small and that's the upside the the
counter to it so here's where we land
with this then the next step up in build
quality would be something like the mesh
of I see it's not far in price it's
around the same price actually but you
would want to buy an additional one to
two fans to really get that performance
out of Metro I see that it deserves to
have so that is a bit of a hidden cost
there this case if you buy extra fans we
replaced four with three good fans and
it perform better by a couple degrees
actually and that's in the earlier
results in the CPU and GPU only charts
so you can improve it but once you start
stacking up fan cost you get rid of the
RGB stuff you're kind of getting a bit a
bit bad on the value because there's
more expensive cases that come out the
same with the fan cost added that will
match performance but it's something you
could do so
yeah the the main competitors here the
case is actually overall not bad there's
clearly some downsides it's cheaper case
there's some static pressure issues with
these fans versus the front panel the
front panel is better than the g-20 one
there don't think has improved on that
point they've gone down from three
filters by one reduction of one so
that's that's an improvement in thermals
- there were some QC issues we found
that we discussed earlier but not major
ones so the existence of seven standoffs
instead of nine with no spares just kind
of stupid hopefully it only happens on
hours but we'll see let us know you have
primary competitors if you wanted to
look around for other things maybe you
want to widen your options and consider
stuff in addition to this one you look
at the Fraxel master by c add in the
cost of one to two fans and it's pretty
good you can look at
now pretty aging silver sonar l06
getting harder to find these days but
still a very good case if you want to
get a bit more spendy you can go up
towards the h 509 P from Coolermaster
just to be clear there's a lot aged 500
and that one is about a hundred bucks on
average very competitive case the NZXT h
500 has a much different approach to all
of these it's more closed off but
depending on your configuration if it's
like this one not terrible in
performance because of the way the
negative pressure setup is configured so
that H 500 also not bad to look at and
that should set you up for overall
pretty good options the Corsair 400 see
if it's still available is another good
one in the ninety two hundred dollar
range so that'll give you a full list to
kind of start with and then you can
expand from there thank you for watching
