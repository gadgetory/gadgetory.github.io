this episode we have a special guest
answer from Johnny guru from the famous
power slide review website he also works
at coarser these days on the power
supply team so we get into that in a
moment and also leave your questions in
the comment section below if you have
questions for the next week's two
episodes we're shooting three today two
of them will be on the main channel one
will go to the patreon backers at
patreon.com slash gamers Naxos if you'd
like to get access to the bonus episode
and then finally got a couple of
community questions that are really good
as well and our second episode that
we're filming for this one will have one
of the overclockers either dare bower or
build Zoid join in for an answer but
we'll get to that in the next video
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal takes view 37 case the view
37 focuses on highlighting custom PC
builds with its full panoramic window
and tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
so just before the first question to
point out again we have new posters in
these are pretty sweet they are video
card component basically a GPU or video
card anatomy posters it shows things
like where the inductors are MOSFETs
memory all that stuff so if you're into
posters we have them on stored on
cameras nexus net you can pick them up
now they're shipping now as orders come
in and they're brown brand new so thank
you for the interest for those of you
who picked up the first ones a quick
aside on that I signed the first ten of
them that I came across when we were
quality checking they are going to go
out at random in the first round of
shipment so the order one you might get
one of the signed ones they're signed
and numbered one out of ten so first
question this is going back to the
previous week's to episodes where one of
our viewers asked about Japanese
capacitors basically what's the deal
with Japanese capacitors you see our
motherboard boxes video card boxes
basically where the vendors are saying
it has Japanese caps and that's supposed
to be enough to get you interested in
buying it so clearly there is this idea
that Japanese capacitors are just
inherently better quality but one would
assume
like most things it's possible for any
country to house companies that are
capable of making bad things too so we
pitched this question we asked builds
write about it last week and he
basically came to the conclusion of well
I don't know of any bad Japanese
capacitors offhand on motherboards that
I work with is sort of what builds what
is getting that and so as far as he was
concerned it's reasonable marketing we
asked Johnny guru as well who is very
particular about his capacitors Johnny
guru from Johnny guru.com formerly and
now at Corsair these days it's probably
one of the most qualified people to talk
to this question on the power supply
front so he said quote they're not
always better per se that just gives you
a sense of security because so far there
are currently no bad Japanese capacitors
there are lots of Chinese and Taiwanese
brand caps that are just as good but
who's going to tour you through a
factory and hold your hand through a
datasheet to explain how when you can
just buy a Japanese brand and I
interjected here in the conversation and
basically said I get you so it's just
easier to market Japanese brand
capacitors because the Taiwan or China
brand capacitors are potentially having
lower floor of quality than Japanese
capacitors so that is what I took away
from that and Johnny agreed that's what
he was trying to convey further said and
he's got a couple of analogies here it's
like if someone says we're going to see
a flick directed by Christopher Nolan
you know it's probably going to be a
great movie no matter what Japanese
capacitors whereas someone says let's
see a John Carpenter flick and you end
up with ghosts of Mars instead of the
thing yes it's a fair marketing bullet
point but it doesn't automatically make
a product better you can't take a crappy
product and make it better with Japanese
capacitors likewise if you use the wrong
cap in the wrong application you still
end up with trouble waiting to happen
like a set of Brembo brakes isn't going
to suddenly make a chevy aveo a great
car or a vo if you prefer so there's
your analogies hopefully one of those
two works for you to expand on this what
what mr. Guru is getting at is
the marketing overall Japanese
capacitors presently as they're made
today
they grew sort of in popularity as many
of you pointed out in the last episode
from a capacitor plague that affected a
lot of the caps back I don't know if was
the late 90s early 2000s and so Japanese
capacitors grew to great popularity
after that and during that event because
they dodged this capacitor plate where
caps would just up and die and actually
a few of you noted that you worked on
boards during that cap leg and made a
lot of money from replacing capacitors
so it's that is that was a particular
piece of knowledge I didn't have before
I appreciate your comments on that but
expanding on what Johnny was saying here
John grow from Corsair these days it's
it's fair marketing it's just that if
the vrm on the motherboard itself is not
a good view around if it has bad MOSFETs
or if it's kind of cheating the phase
design like we've talked about in recent
videos with some motherboards the
Japanese capacitors won't just fix that
problem so there could still be
underlying problems and you still altom
utley have to pick a capacitor that
works for the application it's a great
answer from Johnny guru and he's at
coarser these days if you're curious
what he's been up to it's also helping
us figure out some power supply testing
that we'll be doing more of in the near
future as we move into our office that
we've briefly mentioned the past next
question
tech professor says with the expected
launch of new hardware later in August
and traditional annual Hardware
generation updates each fall when would
you consider the sweet spot to start a
new build so yeah there should be
obviously product updates in quarter
three and four there always are so it's
kind of hard to answer that we don't
know how they're going to perform right
now the way I always answer this
question of should I buy or wait is
pretty straightforward with the system
you have today are you happy with it is
it holding you back in any ways that are
if it's a production system is it
costing you money in terms of time if
it's a gaming system are you just not
enjoying it if you're happy with how it
is just keep using it because new
hardware is always a couple months away
if you don't need something today then
just just wait
if you are unhappy with it if it's
holding you back especially if it's a
work system that it's costing you money
then probably just start upgrading but
keep in mind that there are a lot of
rumors about new GPUs we don't actually
know anything about them yet we don't
know when they're launching if they're
launching and eventually there will be
some but don't know the specs of them
don't know how they're supposed to
perform some of the leaks that are out
there I can tell you with certainty are
incorrect so it's it's really hard to
say how long you should wait or if he
should at all because it we could be
looking at weeks to months GPUs is often
sell out too when they first launched so
if there is a launch there's no
guarantee you're gonna get one
also pricing we don't know what kind of
position they have in the performance
stack we don't know CPUs we don't know
how to % know when Intel's launching
their next stuff we know that the eight
cores are supposed to come out probably
by quarter four it's just we don't have
pricing so if you're thinking I'm going
to buy six core 8700 K or just wait for
an eight core there's no guarantee that
eight core is the same price as a six
core so waiting for it might not matter
if it ends up out of your budget because
it costs more than a six core anyway so
to answer your question you know if you
wait maybe two or three months that's
when we should know everything there is
to know about what's launching in the
last half the year if you can't wait
that long because your systems holding
you back then just just by now because
it doesn't matter what you do it's
always going to be obsolete within a
couple of months because that's how
quickly the industry turns over so
there's always something new around the
corner there's no reason feeling buyer's
remorse or anything like that if
something new comes out within a couple
months of you buying because that's
almost 100 percent of the time going to
happen so you just buy based on how
you're feeling right now about your
system and that's all there is to it
don't don't try and like min/max your
performance $2.00 if it's if it's making
you suffer today but if you can hold off
then I guess hold off it's pretty basic
answer really so Allah says do GBS have
some kind of casual proof OSI protection
I thought someone maxed out the GPU and
memory frequencies in my palette OSI
software because I was curious my PC
just restarted and frequencies were back
to normal it works fine for another two
days but suddenly
would start and regular it wouldn't
start in regular mode then in safe mode
it showed blue and pink vertical lines
distorted colors I guess I fried it was
this my fault
or did I just accelerate the end of the
product life times 465 see a 100 percent
load and I didn't mess with the voltages
there was a 780 super Jetstream couple
things here
do they have casual proof OC protection
yes it's maybe not as much for your
protection as much as his days just
making sure you can't overclock it too
high and invalidate the next product
category up but it's effectively a
protection so the 780 and everything
after it and on the Nvidia side you
can't really change voltage that much
and it's typically voltage that starts
to kill things either either indirectly
from increasing the heat or directly
from just being too much voltage the 780
Maxwell Pascal and even Volta on the
Titan VIII they have extremely limited
voltage overall team Headroom so you
really can't do a lot of damage unless
you start doing things like shut mods
incorrectly if you do a shunt mod on a
shunt resistor like one of these and
dump liquid metal all over the solder
joints that's a problem just quick side
note I know there's been some discussion
about that lately if you're careful with
your liquid metal application and not an
idiot ie you don't just like smear it
all over the solder joints it won't fall
off the board I know some people have
seen that happening but just be careful
about your liquid metal application that
will be fine so unless you're doing that
and you are also just not cautious while
applying the liquid metal it's pretty
hard to kill a video card from
overclocking just increase in
frequencies not enough unless you're
also running way over temperature so at
65 degrees you're perfectly with an
operating range you didn't touch the
voltage now that you can really do it
anyway don't do any BIOS mods it doesn't
sound like so unless you're doing one of
those things it's pretty hard to kill it
it could be complete coincidence it
could be the drivers got screwy
sometimes when you're overclocking and
stuff crashes during the course of an
overclock you can sort of a corrupt the
drivers or corrupt 3dmark installations
I've
all the time so I would recommend go to
Wagner software and download DD you
display driver on installer it's free go
boot it's a safe mode with DD you it has
an option and it's do that do the clean
uninstall of the Nvidia drivers and then
reboot install the Nvidia drivers clean
reboot and hopefully it's fixed you
might have just corrupted the drivers
it's possible that you're talking about
distorted colors often that means some
kind of memory issue either memory over
temperature or if you like bend a PCB
too much you can sort of crack or
disengage the traces to the memory and
that'll cause the distorted colors so if
if you haven't messed with the card
physically it's clearly not that but
it's possible that as it is a couple
years old now maybe there's dust in
between the thermal pads and the memory
modules
maybe thermal paste is drying up so do
the driver thing first if that doesn't
work restart or shutdown actually pull
the card and just take it apart it's
really easy anyone can do it be careful
when you remove the fan headers as long
as you're careful with those not to rip
the cables out of the header you'll be
fine clean off the throttle paste
reapply it and check the thermal pads it
may be apply new ones try and get
something that's the same height as the
ones you have measure it with a width
like digital calipers and you'll be fine
so that's what I would do if you have to
reapply and paste and checking the
thermal pads making sure everything's
making contact thermally if it's still
having problems let us know again I'll
keep an eye out for your name but those
would be the two troubleshooting steps I
would suspect would help as for as far
as overclocked resetting they typically
do that when restarting especially if
they were unsuccessful anyway so I
wouldn't panic just yet it sounds like a
coincidence or it sounds like it was the
catalyst to just something that was
gonna overheat at some point anyway
finally overheating but hopefully it's
just a matter of getting that whatever
that component is back into good contact
so those are my thoughts on that yes
they are a casual proof in general you
can't really overclock even AMD cards
neither neither vendor allows you to
overclock in ways that are extreme
enough to seriously damage them unless
you're also way over
temperature and you were next one proto
amp says this might be a stupid question
but why does fan reporting software have
often have different rpm than what you
would expect if the max rpm of a fan is
1500 as per the spec sheet I'm somehow
able to get 16 100 when it's set to 100%
similarly if I set to 50% speed and I'm
getting 1,100 rpm which isn't the 750 or
800 rpm I would expect maybe it takes
into account minimum rpm so where am I
missing something it's actually
definitely not as stupid questions it's
a very good question there are a lot of
things that cause rpm variants the first
one to point out and this is separate
from what you're talking about is a
hardware level so the motors and just
the fan itself but especially the motors
have a natural variance so every I have
like 15 of the same fans my left on the
floor and every one of those is going to
have a slightly different maximum and
minimum rpm it typically varies by about
plus or minus 10% of the advertised back
on the website if they claim it'll be a
thousand rpm you might get one that's
1,100 you might get one that's something
like 900 and that's just from
manufacturing tolerances so that's the
first thing to keep in mind the
advertised number might be plus or minus
10% of what you get in reality and we
actually talked about that in our course
our H 100 I pro review that one live a
couple days ago where the h1 high Pro
has two fans where one of them was
spending like 5200 rpm lower than the
other one the other part of this is
you're talking about setting to 50%
speeds and not getting exactly 50% of
the max speed a lot of this is PWM range
keep in mind fans often have a minimum
floor for what they can spin at first of
all so the scale isn't necessarily 0 to
1600 it might actually be more like 500
to 1,600 and below that signal strength
of whatever 500 rpm is it'll just be off
so that's a consideration spinning with
PWM versus DC so going DC voltage is
going to affect the fan speed in a
different way than PWM the PWM to rpm
signal response will create a different
rpm readout in your software than just
DC voltage
so as pulse width modulation works
differently than DC where with DC are
just changing from like 12 volts to 7 or
10 it depends on kind of if the
controller is is linear stepping or if
it's like hard points sometimes
controllers are three hard points where
it's like 12 volts seven volts and 5
volts or something like that and that
would control the RPM instead
so that's consideration software is a
consideration they all kind of read it
slightly differently depending on what
softer EEZ me find a hardware info to be
the most accurate so I'd recommend that
and I think that covers most of it I'm
sure I'm overlooking something fence
trains have a lot of reasons for
variants but those are the main ones
it's an you FAC shirring hardware level
tolerances and then whether you're using
pulse width modulation versus DC voltage
control and you can check that in BIOS
if you're not sure your FiOS fan speed
settings will give you the option switch
between them then the third thing being
that the scale isn't 0 to X it's
actually minimum to X and minimum being
often above 400 in most cases next one
is from krill 89 do you ever do you ever
take vacation like go away on a two-week
vacation and not make videos that entire
time know the only reason I really
wanted to include this is to note that
we've got the G on seaside channel where
I uploaded a few things recently from
Whistler Bike Park including talking
about the GPU market while riding down a
mountain at Whistler so I try to get
work involved whenever I can we can't
really take breaks from making videos
especially not for two weeks the most
I'll do is like well kind of before the
LTX trip the line is tech Expo trip we
did six videos in one day and that
covered us for the next six days so that
gives time to travel still working
during that time but it allows me to
work maybe only like four to eight hours
a day instead of whatever we normally do
a lot and and also have videos like
backed up ready to go so a lot of the
time when you see videos sort of a
surrounding conventions there's a good
chance we filmed it like a week ago but
yeah G on steep side channel has some
extra extra videos if you're interested
in that kind of stuff mostly biking at
this point some of its biking I'll talk
about hardware
just for something different it gets the
work involved everywhere I go next one
we've got two left
Vlad Nick who says would it be a good
idea to put little a little Tim between
a component and a thermal pad to improve
heat transfer like putting the thermal
paste on BRM just put it there on pad on
top or put a cooler on top of something
else so or is it a waste of paste the
only reason to really do that is if
you're having trouble with stuff
sticking it's like if you're trying if
you're trying to seep a video card
cooler and the thermal pads are falling
off you're not holding on whatever you
can't get it to line up perfectly you
could put just a dab of thermal paste on
maybe three components just thought
it'll on it it's not going to improve
the thermal transfer will actually worse
but if you just do a small bit for
basically acting as glue but not
literally thermal adhesive don't do that
if you do adjust to act as a bit of
adhesive that will will not inhibit the
thermal transfer too much and it'll help
the pad stick that's the only reason I
would do it anytime you're adding
thermal interfaces between the component
and the cooling device you're going to
worsen the ability to cool you're adding
more layers for it to go through you
basically you want the copper or
whatever aluminium to be as close to the
silicon as possible and adding
interfaces worsens that increases that
distance so it's going to add more
thermal resistance only use it if you
need something that is not a literal
thermal adhesive but it's still kind of
sticky to hold that there all that in
place that's the only reason I would do
that last one Noorie says what has been
the most outrageous proposition towards
snowflake that any vendor has done so
some vendors in your case manufacturers
are probably the worst about this case
manufacturers send with their cases zip
ties can you believe they're trying to
bribe us by giving snowflake toys and
frankly I think it has to stop and I
know that you all don't get zip ties
when you buy cases so it's just I I find
it really troubling that the big case
manufacturing industry is shipping zip
ties just with our cases to try and
bribe our
and the analyst and sometimes CEO
there's gonna be a weird cut just like a
second ago so we got done filming this
this is a few days later now and I
realized I had one more special question
from LTX there was a kid there a comic
kid but he's in sixth grade his name is
Thomas and he came up to me at LTX and
this is why I really admired that kid he
said to me that he basically moved on
from Linus's content to ours because it
was more technical and then he moved on
from hours to build Zoids because we
weren't acting calling out for him so I
holy crap that kid's gonna be like a
chief architect at Intel er and video
someday hey so the kid's name
he is Thomas and he was at LTX with his
dad I talked to them both about career
options and what he was interested in
tried to explain so the YouTube space to
his dad it was a lot of fun it really
inspiring to see that kind of interest
in someone who's got so long to figure
things out still so Thomas asked me and
this again I'm cutting it in oddly
because we forgot and then it'll cut
back to the rest of the video oddly but
Thomas asked me this he said after
explaining to me that we're not good
enough for him any asked to watch builds
right now he said what's the best video
you've ever made I have two answers here
I have the professional answer and I
have the personal answer so let me start
with the professional answer on the
professional side my favorite videos
have been probably the Coolermaster
feature in the it was Coolermaster Intel
and Andy so we got three of the big
companies that we criticized last year
and the video was disappointment built
so it's one of our more popular ones but
we actually we have a lot of unaired
footage from that we went out to an
abandoned mall parking lot at like 2:00
a.m.
Andrews car battery died and everything
and because we were using it as a light
and we filmed a an unaired clip of me
pretending to run over the age 500 P
having second guess is picking it up
putting in the car saving it and then
basically we cut to the Iron Man scene
which is what made it into the final cut
oh this for the H 500 you match
- so it was basically that was
disappointment filled like inspiration
that all got shelved we went with the
attic scene that you saw later and then
we revived that idea for the H 500 PS
ditched the car scene ditched the
abandoned mall and just went with the
Iron Man scene where I'm like forging
and aged 500 Pete mash in the garage
basically so that was a lot of fun
second answer for the professional side
I really enjoyed the EVGA ACX versus icx
testing and that's just because it kind
of put us on the map for a lot of people
it was really interesting from a
methodological point of view to devise
the testing methodology figure out how
do we abuse these vrm components so that
was a lot of fun - and also that's
something that Thomas our asker of this
question is interested in it's VRMs and
things like that on the personal side of
things I'd have to say and this is a
weird answer but 3d vision of all things
3d vision wasn't particularly popular
but it's one of the few aspects of as we
grew it as I started to get review
Hardware in for the first time ever this
was one of the first things I got to
review after a few cases and SSDs and I
got 3d vision in and it's like the the
first review product that I got to show
my dad one of the only things like he
got to see that I worked on because well
yeah so he he looked at 3d vision really
thought it was interesting and and so
that was just fun for me and something
that I hang on to because I don't get
that opportunity now so that those are
the two those are the three videos that
I enjoyed the most I don't know if we
did a video for 3d vision but I did an
article and I despite looking back
despite kind of seen it as really not
the best technology I found it very
impressive at the time and kind of like
VR where I found it like super
impressive when I first tried it really
liked it and then after that it's like I
know that's kind of a lot of work to set
it up and use it so I'm not gonna bother
but I liked it at a time so those are
