Nexus now now we are here at a very loud
Nvidia events called game 24 where they
have just unveiled the GTX 980 and 970
I'm standing here with one of the board
partner GPUs by MSI this is the new MSI
twin frozer 970 GPU or video card I
should say and it is equipped it is
called the 4G that is equipped with the
base specs for the 970 but it's
overclocked and it actually has a 6 pin
and an a pin connector whereas if the
stock GPU only has 2 6 pins
well that means for you is that you've
got more overclocking Headroom because
you can drive more power each 6 pin is
about 150 watts a pin gives you some
more room to play so that is sort of the
idea behind the extra pin out here and
the GPU is using the Twin Frozr setup
that MSI is known for they have a what
looks like a 102 or
hundred-and-something
not quite 90 not quite 120 but it's 100
millimeter fan right here we have 2 of
those and those are push fans they're
pushing the air straight down on to the
aluminum heatsink which is of course
covering the BRM and all that so again
that is the MSI Twin Frozr 4G 970 video
card check out our channel for coverage
of as oh tax new GPS as well and of the
reference model and this is Steve from
game 24 I will see you all next time
