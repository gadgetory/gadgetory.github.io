next in style now we are here at a very
loud nvidia events called game 24 where
they have just unveiled the gtx 980 and
970 i'm standing here with one of the
board partner GPUs by msi this is the
new msi twin browser 97 d GPU or video
card i should say and it is equipped it
is called the 4g it is equipped with the
base specs for the 970 but it's over
clock and it actually has a 6-pin and an
a pin connector whereas if the stock GPU
only has 26 pins what that means for you
is that you've got more overclocking
Headroom because you can drive more
power each 6 pin is about 150 watts a
pin gives you some more room to play so
that is sort of the idea behind the
extra pin out here and the GPU is using
the twin frozr set up that msi is known
for they have a what looks like a 102 or
hundred something not quite 90 not quite
120 but about a hundred millimeter fan
right here we have two of those and
those are push fans they're pushing the
air straight down on to the aluminum
heatsink which is of course covering the
vrm and all that so again that is the
msi twin frozr 4g 970 video card check
out our channel for coverage of as Oh
tax new GPS as well and of the reference
model and this is steve from game 24 i
will see you all next time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
