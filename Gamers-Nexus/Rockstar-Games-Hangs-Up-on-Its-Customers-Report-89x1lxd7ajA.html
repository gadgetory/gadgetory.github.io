dotnet and today we're doing a consumer
report on rockstar games and GTA 5 this
story came about when a few of our
readers emailed us telling us that they
had been hung up on it by rockstar game
support when they called seeking
assistance for hacked accounts and I
wasn't too sure I believed them at first
so I decided to investigate this myself
and call but before getting into that I
want to play you a clip from one of our
readers Rob who called Rockstar support
after being hung up on to inquire as to
why he was hung up on and what course of
action he could take as a consumer to
remedy his hacked account thank you for
coming dr. sport my name's Peter man
Henry first name please hi Peter my name
is Robert Robert Hawking happy nature I
just called and I was hung up on by a
previous person after they continued to
tell me that I'd be contacted by email
on my account my account had been hacked
and I just want to know what the time
frame is that I'll get it back um you
know we're not at liberty to guarantee a
time frame oh and though I can
understand that but can you put me can
you provide me a phone number to contact
this fraud department that I'm being
told about because I just dished out $50
for a game that I have absolutely no
access to no one seems to be able to
tell me when I'll be able to have access
to or the Department that's handling it
it's worth noting that the ticket for
Rob's account has been open for several
days now and has not yet received a
noteworthy update and if you look online
this is actually a common issue so after
hearing this I decided to call with my
own hacked account issue and see if I
would be hung up on by support agents
here's what happened I'll take it out
before Hey yeah I have a ticket number
okay when can I get the ticket number
sir so it is okay sir can I put you can
I put you on hold for a minute sure and
you said and you're correct the ticket
number is wrecked right okay thank you
bro thank you for holding sure oh can I
put you on hold sir yeah go for it okay
thank you okay third thank you for
holding yep
your case has been logged for further
review our understanding is that there
is no further help we can provide at
this time and we will need to end this
call thank you again
hey hang on hang on don't hang up on me
uh so what so the status is is what I'm
sorry could you repeat the status ha ha
as you can see before I even had a
chance to reply from the script that was
read to me the the phone call was
disconnected and I didn't have a chance
to ask if I should be emailing someone
if I had a fraud department I could call
her even if I could get a refund for my
inability to play the game so I decided
to call a second time for parody maybe
this was a one-off instance hello thank
you for calling rossport my name is crow
caws but this issue before yeah I have a
ticket number okay but will she take
Allah with her it is it would be three
issue today I was just calling calling
to follow up and see if there's been any
update to this ticket my GTA social
account was compromised recently and I'm
trying to reattach yeah we are very
sorry for the fact that you are unhappy
with our product service your case has
been logged in our system and will be
rude infer it further okay so is there
any update right now or boy able to just
invite sorry
no sir okay so but is there anything
else we can do for you the helping
troubleshoot I actually was just hung up
on by one of your other support agents
uh so I'm trying to get a very clear
answer you know when I can play the game
that I paid $60 for you
your case will be transferred follow-up
will be via email if we can get you you
know dress you who still have access to
your ticket to monitor for updates as
well okay um is there a supervisor I can
talk to your case has been low for
further review understand is that there
is no further help we can't provide at
this time we need to end this call thank
you for calling us okay so you're
hanging up on me too the sad thing is
that we have even more recordings of
being hung up on but I've removed them
from this video for brevity so at this
point I'm getting fairly annoyed as any
reasonable consumer would be I haven't
yet been given a course of action I
haven't been told what to do when I'll
be contacted or if I can get my money
back so I decided to call one final time
and take a different approach I wanted
to ask the agent directly whether they
were told to hang up on me yeah I
actually I have a ticket number I just
called car minutes ago and I was I was
hung up on so um all right
okay pick it up over here yeah it's are
you over here I'm just trying to get a
clear answer here my account was
actually compromised and so I'm trying
to get access to it again and I'm having
trouble getting a clear answer from the
phone support folks you know what I
should be doing next when I should
expect it to be back in my control well
your case has been logged for you for
the review our understanding is that
there is no further help we can provide
at this time okay um so yeah so is this
like is it standard for support agents
to hang up after saying that line
because I've heard it three or four
times yeah it is it's standard
we we have to okay all right I
understand so that's how rock stars
phone support staff handle their
customers and this is policy pushed down
the chain by rock star and Rob's
original call that he sent me it was
stated by the support representative
that if Rob had purchased the game
through Rockstar warehouse rather than
Green Man gaming or steam or whatever
service then Rockstar would offer a
warranty policy that would cover this
scenario we did you buy the game from
Rockstar warehouse the game was
purchased through Green Man gaming which
was a code for the Rockstar social club
right so if you wanted a a refund you'd
have to go to that despite the fact that
it's Rockstar that's failing to provide
the service so out of desperation I call
back one final time this time I provide
no identifying information they
effectively see me as a new caller and I
decided to ask if the warranty policy
would cover this scenario I'll let you
listen to the somewhat unclear answer
and determine for yourself what you
think I just was wondering if I could go
through the the warranty policy well for
that particular issue we have to
escalate this up because it's a the
account you know we need to get it
straightened out right um yeah I would
this particular situation I'm not sure
if that would cover it because you're
trying to what return it yes so I guess
in an ideal situation the way I kind of
see it being the easiest for everyone is
is terminating the existing account and
then refund me and then I'll just I'll
buy the game and do it that way through
a different email that way it's it's a
hundred percent secure yeah II don't
have a way to really generate the codes
for that the this is the for that
particular scenario that's happening
this is what's been outlined that we
have to do is if we have to escalate the
account up so at the end of the day it
is inexcusable for any support staff to
hand up on their customers before the
customer is even given a chance to
further discuss the issue before the
customer is even given a chance to fully
comprehend what was just read to them
you're still sitting there processing
okay how do I respond to this in a nice
way they hand up on you before you even
have to worry about that in my opinion
that is not an acceptable fashion to
treat your customers who have just spent
fifty or sixty dollars on your game that
they can't play because you had a
security issue it should be noted that
one of these hacked accounts we called
about uses a unique password that is not
used on any other service meaning that
it is not stored in rainbow tables that
we are aware of it is designed in a
fashion which is effectively impossible
to brute-force within the time frame
that it was hacked and perhaps Rockstar
was compromised or something similar to
that the account I was calling about has
been inaccessible for a few days it was
hacked when the email was changed the
account holder received an email
notifying them of the change but not
requesting confirmation which is poor
security further it appears that from
research conducted through forums there
is an issue with sessions remaining
active through Rockstar service for
instance some Xbox users were reporting
that they were still logged into their
accounts even after they were
compromised and their emails and or
passwords had been changed so that is
rockstars policy that is how they treat
their customers when it comes to a
hacked account I have reached out to
Rockstar for official comment and have
not yet received a reply if you dislike
the way we were treated in these phone
calls by Rockstar I would advise you to
share this video reach out to them
perhaps via email maybe not clog the
phone lines as those people really do
have no control from our investigation
and see if maybe we can enact some
change just by reaching out via email
Twitter things like that and get in
touch with the company responsible for
this that is all for this video I will
see you all next time thank you for
calling Rockstar Games technical support
please note this call may be monitored
or recorded for Quality Assurance
