three fan cooler on the bench today but
it's also the most expensive of the 1080
t eyes we've reviewed thus far this card
is seven hundred and eighty dollars
right now
thirty dollars more than the new price
of the sp2 and thirty dollars more than
the MSRP of the gaming axe and extreme
horas card our review of the PCB and vrm
for the FTW three gave the card high
marks for insane over engineering on all
accounts now it's up to the testing to
determine if that over engineering
offers any functional value for the
extra thirty dollars spent before
getting to that this in-depth coverage
is brought to you by our patreon
supporters you can go to
patreon.com/scishow nexus if you'd like
to help us out directly as that is one
of our driving sources of revenue or if
you prefer a one-time purchase store
that gamers nexus net for one of our
shirts our new graph shirts now come in
try blends which are very comfortable
we've already got a fold PCB and vrm
analysis of the FTW three on the channel
it's pretty in-depth twenty six minutes
long done by residents over conquered
build Zoid but three caps on the basics
of the cooler and the PCB this is a two
slot 1080 TI for some reason that most
of the manufacturers this generation are
doing two point five or three slot cards
for the 1080p is that includes the
gaming x and the extreme horas which is
the biggest one we've looked at thus far
there are very few two slot cards this
is one of them as you can see so it is a
bit smaller than some of the others
we've tested that means it's limited in
some ways like the fan size and the
cooler depth which will impact
performance overall but it's smaller so
that's your trade-off now the card is
also way over built in the cooling dept
this is something that EVGA absolutely
lost their minds after ACX and made
apparently a resolution to one put
thermal pads on everything including the
fan controllers and inductors and
components that don't need the cooling
and to really beef up their cooling
design in general so the heatsink alone
we kind of detailed in our initial ICS
review in February when the icx mine but
to recap some of it again they've it's
it looks like a standard
thin stack so they've got normal kind of
thin density and spacing for the fins
it's just aluminum fins copper heat
pipes throughout the whole thing it's
segmented into two partitions for the
GPU and the vrm components so that's all
pretty normal
they've also gone and drilled holes
through the cooler through the heatsink
so that gives you some more surface area
and potentially room for the air to pass
through and they've added thin
cylindrical fins to the base plate which
is different how much does it help as
we've said in the past it's kind of hard
to say we did a B testing of a CX versus
IC x with the IC X review in February
and that you should check that out
because that has really the the best
coverage we've done to date in terms of
testing one cooler versus another
so that will answer that how much does a
health question for this card
specifically though you're paying a lot
of money for over engineering basically
and most of that comes in the form of
the PCB rather than just the cooling as
always it does kind of start to become a
question of how much does this really
help you because with Pascal you can
over engineer all you want or you can
just throw as many fats on as you want
you can use this high-quality components
as you want pascal still limits you at
the end of the day particularly in the
voltage budget Department that is an
Nvidia limitation so they've gone in and
set BIOS limitations to voltage
throughput it's something like 1.09
three volts is about your max if you're
lucky so at the end of the day you're
always going to be limited with these
cards but let's recap some of the PCB
and BRM stuff and then get into the
testing so build Zoids got the full
analysis of this on our channel but the
basic EVGA is using NCP eight one one
five eight DS for the drivers on semi
ntp eight one one six two s for the
doublers and Alpha Omega semiconductor
69 30s for the memory and core vrm
MOSFETs these are dual end sets so you
get high side low side and diodes all in
one package they are dense the design is
a 10 phase vrm but it's doubled so there
are five phases doubled because there's
no such thing as a 10 phase voltage
controller at least not in
a side of the industry which helps
spread the heat load and power load with
a copper vrm place conducting heat to
the cooler directly further helping with
the heat sinking and dissipation that is
part of the over design on the cooler
that copper plate is in there it touches
through thermal pads to the vrm
components the MOSFETs on the doublers
directly you can see the imprints on the
pad and it's not necessarily needed but
it certainly helps drive down the
temperatures the review today is going
to focus almost entirely on thermals and
noise we do have game tests but just to
make a point here testing gaming
performance with multiple 1080p eyes is
going to yield a very boring result we
run the test for validation but the
differences are going to be limited
because it's a 1080 Ti it's the same GPU
between all of them and more importantly
there are manufacturing variants issues
between cards so you could we actually
have two of these and they perform
slightly differently we have to have a
lot of the cards and they perform
slightly differently that's because not
all chips are created equal
particularly with boost 3.0 designs
under Nvidia so there's not a whole lot
of point to testing gaming on every
single 1080i that comes through we do it
for validation but this will focus on
thermals so keep that in mind
so diving into things testing
methodology will be linked in the
description below as always that's the
full article it has all the charts in
written format if you prefer the first
chart is our clock versus temperature
plot which is used under a power virus
scenario to draw maximum power through
the card and test its clock stability
note that this type of test does not
enumerate the clock in the same way that
a game in workload would the frequency
is that lower here than it would be in
games but power draw is significantly
higher particularly with heavier load on
the BRM components the FT w3 is able to
leverage it's cooler to maintain a
stable clock similar to what we've seen
with most 1080 TI cards we've tested
thus far other than the F II card a
clock has a range and fluctuations of
about 50 megahertz one held at 66 C
indicating relatively consistent
frequency throughout the test that's
what we want to see the flatter the
better for this line ramping into other
thermal tests let's first start with a
reminder this is a refresher from our s
see to coverage this chart shows the sc2
temperatures of with and without the
holes covered in the shroud indicating
that the holes in the face plate of EVGA
a new design are more for looks and for
functionality these are not functionally
better for cooling the same holds true
with St w3 they're really just there if
it looks let's move it to a test we're
just out of pure curiosity we unplugged
the third fan and ran the other two at
fixed speeds this test was conducted
with all fans at the same speed the only
difference was disabling the power fan
on the second test just because we
figured the over-engineering on the BRM
and the cooler would be enough to keep
the power components within spec without
that third fan the result is mostly what
you'd expect running two fans that
results in higher temperatures but
despite being somewhat expected this
data is still really interesting we
don't normally have this level of access
to temperature sensors without placing
them on the board ourselves and often
them of that to two to three
thermocouples because there are nine
diodes on the IC X cards we're able to
fully understand the impact of a2 fan
versus three fan cooler across the PCB
not just from the GPU and our own
thermocouples so using EVGA NTC
thermistors as far as power component
temperatures are concerned it's really
not that much of a loss to move to to
fence the overbuilt vrm and the heatsink
through their job keeping the vrm
components within spec in our tests even
that 87 c number for power 4 isn't
terrible but power 4 isn't a MOSFET on
this card it's actually the back of the
PCB behind one of the RAM components of
the GPU but still not that bad what's
more interesting is that the third fan
which EVGA has positioned over those
components seen it's the most heavily
impact the GPU temperature itself
GPUs diode temperatures increased by
roughly 10 C without the third fan
spinning despite the fact that the GPU
and memory fans the left-most two fans
are spinning at the same speed as with
three fans this indicates that the heat
pipes and right side of the sink are
dissipating a significant amount of heat
from the GPU silicon and that the third
band is necessary to dump that heat from
the fins we can validate these numbers
by looking at GPU backside temperatures
which have risen about 60 also the
memory components really don't seem to
care either way they are certainly
benefitted by the third band
the difference is about six or seven
Celsius and those memory modules are
rated for well over the heat that
they're experiencing in both tests so
although that's not something you're
likely to do disabling the third fan it
does help us understand how the cooler
functions the third fan is not really
all that important for power
temperatures because they're still way
within spec which means you can build a
fan profile to spin that fan slower and
not have to worry about your vrm
components like the feds heating up too
much so that helps with noise when
you're profiling the fan but GPU
temperature does go up a bit because
you're losing some of the dissipation
potential over this entire half of the
heatsink which obviously touches a bit
of everything on the car not just power
components this next chart shows
temperatures versus the sc2 card
unfortunately half of this chart is
useless here's why EVGA positions its
sc2 and FTW three thermistors in
different locations on the board which
we can show on the screen now this means
that despite really wanting to compare
the two directly we really can't power
reading for for instance is really warm
on the FTW three a much warmer than on
the sc2 in the side-by-side comparison
but it's also on the back of the PCB
with FTW three located behind a VRAM
module and above the GPU backside that's
going to be a really hot spot of the
board and the sc2 positions its power
for module on the front side and within
the mosfet region so it's measuring a
completely different location on the
board and even a different side going
back to our thermal chart between the
two you can see how this difference
plays out power 4 on the sc2 it looks
significantly lower but it's also
measuring a different component these
are therefore not directly comparable
aside from the to GPU temperatures and
some of the memory temperatures
fortunately we also position our own
thermocouples on all the cards and put
those in the same spot each time so we
can directly compare these readings
let's look at the s TW 3 components we
measured with thermocouples as opposed
to the IC x NTC thermistors then compare
those against MSI gigabyte and the
NVIDIA F II cards we're still expanding
on this chart this is brand new and
we're excited with more detail for it in
the future including V RAM and a fixed
40 DBA output test for now this is where
it's starting with auto settings for the
coolers all cards running out of box
clocks we see the EVGA 1080
w3 keeps lower-powered temperatures than
everyone else meaning that they could
sacrifice some of the cooling department
for lower noise this is a common trend
with EVGA where the auto fan is
aggressively profiled compared to the
competition at 63 up 7 Celsius for the
power measurement on the middle of the
Fed's EVGA runs at nearly 20 see cooler
power components in gigabytes whoo-whee
remarks ran warm in our extreme RS
review and about 7c coolers on the
gaming X so far the EVGA FTW 3 is the
coolest 1080 Ti that we've tested to
date for both the GPU diode and power
component temperatures but there's
another component to a cooler and that's
noise until we add our 40 DB a fixed
temperature testing let's look at the
normal noise charts under idle
conditions the fans spin down to 0 rpm
just like other cards do right now
outside we've noticed that the fan does
like to spend up to 700 somewhat
regularly on the GPU but you could shut
that functionality down with the custom
curve Auto conditions place the EVGA FTW
3 at 42 to DBA whereas the msi gaming
addict operates about 36.5 DBA and the
gigabyte extreme horas is about 38.8 DBA
considering both of these cards running
warmer than the FTW 3 which is the
coolest of the 1080i is thus far it
makes sense that the quieter cards would
run a bit warmer the really interesting
test will be our fixed DBA temperature
tests which are still underway and we
posted separately regardless for now the
EVGA FTW 3 sits perceptively louder than
the extreme orison gaming XO the gaming
X deserves praise for its significantly
lower noise levels which are made
possible by the fact cooler and taller
high defend EB J's FTW 3 fans are about
90 millimeters across whereas the gaming
ICS is about 100 millimeter fans let's
move on to some brief game tests our
overclocked stepping charges on the
screen now we weren't able to push our
FTW 3 is too high but that's been true
for basically every 1080 I would come
across thus far these cards are already
up against frequency limits on Pascal
and aren't particularly impressive
overclockers with thanks to voltage
limitations imposed by Nvidia's bios
running ghost recon at 4k the 1080i FTW
3 is the fastest of the non overclocked
1080 TI cards running an average FPS
only marginally higher than sc2 and this
is within test variance by the way so we
can fairly state as the SC 2 and have TW
3 are functional
equal in average FPS gaming X is next
down the line of 58 average with the
extreme or s at about 57 average there's
no meaningful difference between any of
these cards when it comes to pure FPS
which makes sense in a world where boost
3.0 it largely equalizes cards at the
same chip anyway overclocking that tw3
isn't particularly exciting either
despite the PCBs higher quality will
highlight those numbers anyway but again
it doesn't really matter how much you
engineer these boards without power mods
and hard mods you're not going to be
able to overcome the voltage and power
limits established by Nvidia and Nvidia
establishes those they say for safety
because the 400 series and 600 series
had a lot of people over volt in beyond
where they should have at 1440p Ghost
Recon performance is largely the same
stack FTW three runs an average of 95
with 1% loads at 82 and 0.1% loads at 80
comparatively the gaming X operates at
92.7 average with the extreme Oris also
at 93.7 FPS average and the sc2 at about
95 FPS average overclocking helps out
marginally once again but we don't quite
break 100 FPS running doom with woken at
4k that uga 1080i FTW three is once
again the fastest stock card on the
bench even versus the Titan XP in this
case and it outperforms the our gaming X
by about 1.2 percent that's certainly
not jaw-dropping gains and can be
partially accounted for with chip to
chip manufacturing variants but it is a
lead nonetheless the FTW three also
outranks our gigabyte extreme card by
4.5 percent as the extreme Oris is
running into power limits under stock
conditions without pushing the power
budget further overclocking moves ranks
around a bit but again games are limited
overall for the 1080i class cards Sniper
Elite 4 with DX 12 and a sync compute
lands at the 1080i FTW 3 again at the
top of the stacks of 1080i listings just
barely ahead of the Amazon X in fact
these two are effectively identical as
they're within test as variants where to
F gets ahead of the extreme card or
about 2.8 percent which does fall out of
variance but it is not really that
exciting if you really want more game
benchmarks they will be in the article
links in the description below
it's just that we're looking at
something where thermals and noise
matter a whole lot more than gaming
performance because once you've
established a baseline for gaming
between the AIB partner cards it doesn't
change a whole lot it's not like they
make the actual Jeep
you that's making the cooler and the
bored so if you can run into limits no
matter what so the gaming axes and
extremes can swap places between
reviewers just because you might have
different quality chips and the same is
true here this is on our bench the
highest performing stock card but at
times that's a difference of 1% or less
in some cases so it's not FPS thing
we're talking out here in terms of
thermals and noise which is what
actually matters
this runs a more aggressive fan profile
than some of the other cards the gaming
acts included so that means it's a bit
louder but it's also cooler just one of
those trade-offs you could build a
custom fan profile with this and
probably should if you buy one because
that power fan doesn't need to run as
fast really none of them need to run as
fast as they do you could run a higher
temperatures with a lower noise level
probably get around or under 40 DBA and
still be just fine in the temperature
Department unless you're in a really hot
ambient environment so that stated just
like the SE 2 you should tune fans if
you buy this card but this is a $780
card so it's a tough sell the others are
750 the FC 2 is originally something
like 720 which was a really good buy now
at 750 I think there was a pre-order
thing but at 780 we're 30 over every
other card we've reviewed the PCB is
fantastic engineering it's really well
done and builds or breaks it all down in
our video the cooler is good engineering
the icx stuff is pretty cool but it does
not make the gaming experience better
that's just it's how these things work
so what you're looking at is short of
doing shunt mods and hard mods you're
stuck in a power limit and a voltage
limit that means you can overclock more
than the competition in fact most of the
overclocking limits are going to be more
chip the chip variance from the PCB
itself unless you buy a really really
bad PCB so it's it's just a question of
what is what do you get for an extra $30
over and I see two answers a fan so what
do you do with that okay you can run
them at slower speeds and get lower
noise output maybe decibel or two so
maybe that's valuable to you but the FC
2 is already pretty good it's $30
cheaper it does all the same gaming
overclock and everything really
a bit quieter and is reasonable in every
aspect as well
extreme Morris is okay it's the warmest
and it's louder than the gaming acts not
really
I'd be looking at the gaming acts sp2 or
the FCW three and only the FTW three if
you really really want it for some
specific reason
otherwise the sc2 is a better buy at the
price both of them are two slot coolers
which is perhaps the primary difference
an advantage over something like the
gaming X otherwise back to what we were
saying on the previous reviews at $750
there are a lot of cards that are 720
and 730 from EVGA included that would
probably suit you just as well but have
slightly less flashy coolers and
components and still perform more or
less the same noise levels on these
seven $50 cards though are pretty good
especially if you're going to custom
tune them so that's it
great PCB good cooler it's a little
louder than the competition a little
cooler as well so just comes down to how
much you value those things but I'm
having a hard time seeing why to buy
this over an SC to considering for 99%
of people they are functionally the same
so if you know a reason great buy it for
that reason but I don't have one for you
