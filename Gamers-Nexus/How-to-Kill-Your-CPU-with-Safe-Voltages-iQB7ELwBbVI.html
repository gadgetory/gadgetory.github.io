overclock a CPU to death so basically
what we're going to be looking at here
is how increasing SOC voltages or
graphics voltages as it's called with ap
use can result in voltages that are
deadly or at least could degrade the
integrated memory controller or other
components on the CPU this is something
that's very easy to do we talk often
about how overclocking is of course at
your own risk well there's a reason for
that and even with guidance posted
online by overclockers by media outlets
like us by AMD or Intel official
companies even with that guidance it's
still possible to end up in a scenario
where you input a voltage number that
was suggested in one place but on your
particular BIOS on your particular
motherboard whatever it could end up
being damaging without you even knowing
it so we're gonna talk about that today
two things we're focusing on are showing
how the SOC voltage through the socket
through the back of the motherboard is
actually often different from what's
measured in software like hard R and fo
and of course if you were at the max of
what's safe and hardware info but this
is higher reading it off the real board
that's where problems could arise before
that this video is brought to you by
thermal grizzly makers of the conductor
hot liquid metal that we recently used
to drop 20 degrees off of our
temperatures thermal grizzly also makes
traditional thermal compounds we use on
top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydronaut pastes learn more at the link
below let's start with a basic example
one of the first things that anyone asks
including us with overclocking is what's
a safe voltage so for most consumers you
might go to Andy Intel Nvidia or come to
us we go to people like their Bower or
build Zoid or any of them and then
hopefully between them and between the
companies we can figure something out
but at the end of the day it's all kind
of just you're relying on hoping that
the number is correct because without
really testing it you don't necessarily
know where things die and of course you
know if you pump 1.5 volts into a CPU it
will be bad but the question is more of
is one
point two five okay is one point three
too far because these are only 0.05
apart but there could be degradation
over a period of six months for example
which is of course very bad and you
don't want that so with the Raven Ridge
ap use as an example
conventional wisdom with Rison suggests
that a safe SOC voltage is one point two
here's where the question comes in is
that one point two as in the number that
I type into the interface rise in master
bios or is it one point two actually
going through SOC on the board and
through the SOC vrm with Raven Ridge a
new suggested safe SOC voltage depending
on which company you asked could be as
high as 1 point three volts but again if
we're talking one point three typed into
the interface versus one point three in
reality those numbers can be very
different to give you a quick example we
have three tables that we built took
about 16 hours we'll put them on the
screen briefly and then we'll go back
through them very specifically later and
in these three tables one thing we did
was check the different input voltages
SOC and APU graphics voltage versus
what's measured on the back of the
socket which you can measure with a
simple digital multimeter and in some
instances putting in a number of 1.3
which is a new supposed potentially safe
SOC voltage again depend on what company
you asked putting that number in in some
cases can equal about 1.3 in other cases
it could equal 1.4 if it's 1.4 and
especially if it's sustained you've just
condemned your integrated memory
controller to death or more likely
degradation it's not like it's gonna up
and die at 1.4 but what might happen is
over a span of six months or it could be
10 months over a period of time there
will be degradation in what frequency be
in this case and integrated graphics
chip can sustain at its current voltage
as it degrades you might have to
increase voltage to a point that it is
no longer safe or even less safe or you
decrease the frequency and these are
things we don't want so go through a
couple more notes here before starting
I'm going to show you how the
discrepancy appears between the back of
the socket and software hardware info
arising master and then we're going to
talk about some of the tables that we
spent a whole day creating with just
three motherboards only three and how
much they differ one to the next in
terms of V droop or over voltage or
under voltage or whatever so some very
quick things your V group can require
higher LLC or load line calibration
levels to stabilize the input voltage
closer to the configured number this is
one of the easiest ways to ensure the
number you type in is what you're
getting as opposed to maybe some auto
LLC's will actually really under deliver
on that voltage we've had this problem
to pass you type in 1.4 and reality are
getting 1.3 so load line calibration can
help with this if you're not sure what
that is and you want to know more than
what I've just told you we have an
entire video on that done by a hardcore
overclocker if you use this allen tears
names build Zoid so we'll link that
below and that's that's one of the
things we need to know LLC tables on
boards can differ so one board to the
next it's not gonna be the same that
means if you follow a guide for a board
you don't have you could kill something
damage it or you might just end up in
the best case with it unstable overclock
because voltage isn't high enough to
things specifically to Raven Ridge here
before we start apu graphics voltage is
a number that you'll see rise and master
has it for example so rise and match
recalls it AP graphics voltage they also
have an SRC voltage these are more or
less the same thing so ultimately AP
graphics voltage and SRC voltage are
going to the same place they're
controlled by the same vrm it's the SOC
BRM it's typically the well it's always
the more limited phase count v RM on the
board of the two main V RMS for AMD
boards so when you adjust graphics
voltage you are adjusting SOC voltage
the same rules of safety apply to each
even though for example you could type
in a very high number it doesn't mean
it's same so that those two numbers are
basically the same now we have a kind of
a hypothesis on what the difference is
why there would be two different inputs
for them and based on some limited
testing on a couple of motherboards
our current theory is that AP graphics
voltage on some boards is instantiated
specifically when 3d clocks are called
whereas the soc voltage is instantiated
when 2d clocks are called
so if you have numbers of 1.14 SOC and
1.2 for graphics then you launch 3d mark
1.2 is what should be being referenced
however if you're doing something
without 3d clocks then it should be that
as I see voltage however this theory
only really worked on one line of
motherboards from one vendor because
graphics voltage actually doesn't work
at all
on one of the other boards we test it it
does nothing and then on the third board
it seems to stack with the SRC voltage
so you would do 1.2 SOC 1.2 graphics and
you'd end up with one point 4 volts SOC
measured at the back of the board so it
all depended on the vendor but let's get
into the testing now this is going to
start with a demonstration on a gigabyte
board this is the gigabyte gaming k5
it's one of the board's we tend to
prefer for rise and overclocking however
it does have some limitations and one of
the things that gigabyte commonly does
is they tend to push a bit more voltage
through everything than what you've
asked for now that's not necessarily a
bad thing other vendors push too little
so at the end of the day all that
matters is that you were aware of the
behavior of the particular board so the
fact that it pushes more isn't
inherently bad unless you're not aware
of it then it could be very bad so I'm
gonna do first
we just have everything set up auto
right now I'm gonna launch 3d mark on
the host system so for this first
demonstration on the gaming k5 we're
gonna use the auto voltage settings in
BIOS and just these rise in master for
sake of ease and demonstration and all
we're gonna do is set a super achievable
1,300 megahertz clock so we're not
really overclocking it right now but
that's not the point
so we'll go 1,300 it does in increments
of 50 and we're going to set a 1.1 SOC
and 1.1 graphics voltage so both of
those are 1.1 and we just need to put it
under some load so for SOC voltage right
now and hardware in 464 we're reading
about 1.0 volts
point-9 to 1.01 volts and this is with a
one point one configuration and risin
master for both SOC and the APO graphics
but what we need to do is check the real
voltage at the back of the socket so we
can do that with a multimeter pretty
easily and all I'm going to do is stab a
a molex ground which if you don't know
where those are our mod mats have handy
diagrams that show where they are and
then I'm going to just hit the correct
corresponding SOC cap which we've
already determined 1.2 so we are at 1.2
volts going into the socket as opposed
to on hardware info 1.0 ish 11.0
basically so in this instance you might
think that you're only pushing about a
volt into there and at max 1.01 which is
quite a bit different from 1.2 that is a
massive difference so we're getting a
bit of over voltage versus what's being
reported here a part of that is some of
the resistance between the pin and the
pads and the socket as we discussed
elsewhere in this video but part of its
just gigabyte behaving a bit differently
from the other boards so if we want to
further this maybe you didn't check the
back of the socket you're a normal
end-user you're just looking at hardware
info and rise master you think your
voltage is still pretty low so at this
point you might go ok I'm gonna push the
1500 megahertz and you know what just
maybe I had some stability issues at
this voltage so let's go all the way up
to 1.25 and this specific number is
really meant to just illustrate a large
change we wouldn't expect you to and
wouldn't recommend that you do
increments that large but the point is
to demonstrate something not to provide
a guide of how to overclock so this
number specifically some vendors have
recommended 1.25 as a safe SOC voltage
in the past some have a very hard
recommendation of 1.2 as a max SOC
voltage and then AMD has apparently also
mentioned day 1.3 SOC voltage or APU
graphics all digits same exact
Thayne these two things they go through
the same VRM so let's just apply 1.25
and see what happens so now we're seeing
in hardware info one point one five one
point one four so we're we're under one
point two and over one point three it
looks like one point one three excuse me
so yeah one point one five is about
where we are now versus one point two
five for the configuration so it still
looks pretty good you might just kind of
leave it here you can even push it a
little higher if you're assuming one
point three is safe you can push it
higher if you're assuming one point two
safe doesn't really matter if you listen
to one vendor or the other if one says
one point two one says one point three
either way we're below both 1.2 and 1.3
right now so let's check the socket side
for its voltage one point three for
quite high getting dangerously high in
fact so with the folks we've spoken to
about this one over 1.3 likes a
sustained one point three six volts is
getting kind of rough for an APU for the
SOC specifically you could start
damaging it degrading it or burning it
out with a sustained over 1.3 volt input
to the CPU but of course rise master and
hardware are giving us completely
different much lower numbers and this
isn't necessarily a fault of one board
or the other or even a fault of hardware
info it's that they are technically we
were reading two different things one
we're reading at the back of the socket
you can't get much more direct than that
and the other one is through sensors
through the CPU after resistance and
aggregate data and all that other stuff
so that's what we've got for basics now
we could do one more example here and
let's say that you know one point three
five certainly is inadvisable however
you might still be able to argue it
let's say you ended up pushing out I was
sixteen hundred sixteen fifty something
like that and in the process of doing so
you went with maybe a really high well
comparatively high voltage of something
like one point two eight seven five
let's go with that because if you're
listening to guidance from the board
vendors or from AMD where sometimes they
say one point three is say if once again
there's difference between typing in 1.3
here and getting 1.3 into the CPU and we
need to determine which one they're
talking about when they say that you
need to understand what they mean when
they say 1.25 or 1.3 or whatever is safe
because they're different things so
right now we're getting one point one
seven five we're not quite at one point
two yet and you could see this as
potentially an LLC issue because higher
LLC if we could set it with this board
would potentially stabilize out of it
but either way we're almost at one point
two sometimes let's do one more
measurement back the socket so one point
two sometimes for hardware info versus
one point three seven to one point three
eight that's bad that will degrade the
integrated memory controller over time
it is definitely not a good voltage to
push into there so one last number
something we've determined is pretty
stable on our sample is sixteen fifty
megahertz on this motherboard at only
one point one eight I think one point
one eight one two five so we determined
this to be stable that number is pretty
damn low compared to the guidance of 1.2
to 1.3 as a safety but again it's
because there's a difference versus load
line calibration V group stuff like that
where the number we're reading out
versus putting in our two different
things so one point one for hardware
info looks pretty good we're stable at
sixteen fifty megahertz one point one
eight for AP graphics which is SOC
voltage and then at the socket one point
two eight perfectly well it's hard to
say exactly but some vendors have told
us this is perfectly acceptable and then
guidance for rise in speaking with some
of the XO c guys the extreme
overclockers we've heard one point two
is the safety guidance and some other
board vendors as well however Raven
Ridge is a different products than Rison
so it's possible it's changed but either
way compared to one point three seven
one point two seven is significantly
lower that's a big deal so that's what
we're talking about and make sure you
know which voltage people are when I say
people which voltage menu
actuaries or overclockers are talking
about when they say the number 1.2 is
safe for the number 1 point 3 is safe
because the difference in point 1 there
is enough to seriously degrade or damage
or destroy an SOC over time because a
point 1 difference is one point three
two one point four one point four
definitely starts to create your IMC one
point three I'm a bit nebulous on I've
heard from multiple different people
that one point three is fine I've heard
from more people that one point two to
one point two five is that they
suggested the most reliable source that
I've spoken with so far has suggested
that peaking at one point three is
perfectly acceptable for the Raven Ridge
SOC and the same source has suggested
that peaking at something like one point
three six and holding there is bad so
that's kind of your your margin for
error if we go with that specific source
but again this is all practical hands-on
stuff so until things start dying it's
hard to say precisely what's acceptable
if you want my recommendation for a very
safe guidance 1.2 is a good place to sit
for the actual voltage going into the
CPU not necessarily what you type in
1.25 I would also feel somewhat
comfortable with with Raven Ridge and
one point three is where you're just
you're you're just kind of betting on
who said what because again some people
have told us one point three is fine
some have said the opposite so it all
depends Raven Ridge as I understand it
should be fine
at one point three sustained but
obviously lower is better so maybe shoot
for one point to one point two five
let's quickly recap some of our findings
on the three boards we tested we
observed to the following what's the MSI
motherboard the be 350 tomahawk we
noticed that APU graphics voltage the
option and rise and Master did not seem
to do anything that's broken we ended up
using SOC voltage via bios instead to
adjust the stability of it all and LLC
options also didn't seem to do very much
on this particular be 350 tomahawk board
level six LLC resulted in lower voltage
than auto and level eight is apparently
somewhat equal to auto or slightly lower
depending
you're looking at and this seems to have
V group issues and under-voltage vs.
target at times as well so that's the
MSI Board's characteristics again we're
not necessarily saying what's bad or not
all we're saying is be aware of those
things
the Asus Board behaves a bit differently
first of all we tested an Asus at B 350
M - E this is not an overclocking
motherboard for from it and I mean you
could tell that by looking at the lack
of heat sinks on the DRAM so that said
we wanted to test it for a specific
reason which will be our second video
and we'll talk about that later
but either way the MOSFETs can easily
breach 120 degrees Celsius if you're
pushing high voltages because it's
really not meant to handle that kind of
voltage however we did find that we
could reasonably hit 15 50 megahertz
with a 1.1 volt SOC input and 1.2 volt
graphics input the result was 1.25 volts
via multimeter which seems acceptable
MOSFETs still run pretty hot but not bad
considering what a cheap board it is and
conversely from that with Auto LLC 1.2
volts SOC and 1 point 3 volts graphics
which are settings that might actually
be okay on some boards but not this one
what you end up with is 1.3 7 volt to be
a multimeter it was capable of 1650
megahertz but you'd be roasting the
MOSFETs and at one point three seven
volts you'll be damaging the SOC as well
gigabytes board we couldn't find any SOC
LLC options for now users will need to
be aware that while the msi board is
often biased under volting the targets
the gigabyte board is often biased over
volt in it a 1.1 to 5 volt input is
sufficient to stabilize at 1550
megahertz and hardware info and the
gaming k5 seems under report voltage
somewhat notably versus reality to the
effect that hardware info will show 1.0
seven volts SOC but the multimeter will
show one point two three seven which
could lead to users killing the IMC if
they are just applying some blanket one
point two number and assuming it works
because one point two can equal one
point three two one point three four or
higher in reality so now we're gonna get
into some SOC and LC tables that we put
together from hands-on testing with
everything that was rude anyway I was
saying with the
tables what we're gonna be showing you
is just some hands-on testing and we've
got that for the same three board so
let's go through those now here's a
table of our issues SOC checks the color
coding is based on frequencies when we
changed frequency we changed row color
at one point one volts SOC and one point
one volts apu graphics input we were
measuring one point one two to one point
one three volts with a multimeter or
1.05 vi 1.08 one with hardware info this
was with a low frequency of 13 or
megahertz going to fifteen fifty
megahertz had a one point one volt SOC
and one point two volt graphics reading
out as one point two to three via
digital multimeter or one point one five
to one point one eight one via hardware
info that's with high LLC which was
required for stability here's the
dangerous one at 1600 megahertz and with
extreme LLC we configured 1.2 volts SOC
at 1.2 volts graphics and read out one
point three five volts SOC via DMM if
you're relying on hardware info you'd
think that you were only at one point
two nine to one point three which again
depend on who you ask are sort of
acceptable though pushing it and not
really acceptable on this motherboard
mind you given the heatsink limitations
but conventional wisdom would suggest
that 1.25 volts is ok for most ap use
according to some of our contacts this
board isn't really meant to push this
high but that's beside the point the
point is that these voltage is 1.2 on
each to grade the IMC over time that was
with extreme LLC though let's dial back
to Otto since that's what most people
use even with Auto LLC a 1650 megahertz
clock was held with a 1.2 bolt as our CN
1 point 3 volt graphics voltage in
reality these numbers equaled one point
three seven volts and up in other words
hope you don't need a memory controller
for very long the msi be 350 tomahawk is
next this one sometimes had V droop but
not always and we also noticed the APU
graphics voltage didn't really seem to
do anything on this board it was all
driven by normal SOC voltage going for
1600 megahertz with a 1.2 volt SOC and
1.2 bolt graphics allowed the frequency
to hold using Auto LLC and the DMM
output was one point two four five volts
while hardware info reported one point
one eight to one point two volts
increasing graphics voltage to one point
three did nothing here and did not
change the voltage readings at all going
to 1650 megahertz
1.3 volts SOC had us reading 1 point 3 5
volts via DMM but hardware info was
reading one point to 7 to 1 point 3
volts
finally the gigabyte gaming k5 seems to
push voltage more heavily than other
boards this isn't inherently a fault
with gigabytes of motherboard it's just
that users need to be aware of the
behavior on this board and how it's
different from MSI and Asus which means
that following a guide for a different
motherboard could easily have you
inputting unsafe or unstable voltages at
1500 megahertz with a 1.1 volt SOC one
fights evil graphics we have BIOS we
measured a 1.3 volt output via digital
multimeter harder info read 1 point 1 go
into 1 point one volts SOC and 1 point 3
volts graphics gave us at one point
three nine one point four volts SOC
which is dangerous to the health of IMC
this is where we realized that gigabyte
was being more aggressive than MSI again
not a fault of either just the behavior
we dropped to one point one five volts
graphics input voltage which resulted in
a 1.25 volt DMM reading as you can see
in this table 16 50 megahertz was held
with an input number of one point one
volts SOC and one point one eight one
two five graphics resulting in a one
point two eight ball SOC voltage as
measured at the socket but one point one
volts via Hardware info the takeaway
here is that the gig white board only
required us to input one point 1 8 volts
for graphics to get 1 point 3 out
whereas the msi board would require 1.3
volts input to get roughly the same out
the Asus board would require 1.2 to 1.25
to get 1.3 out and these are behaviors
that you need to be aware of on the
motherboards and they are somewhat
unique to each board as for why the
numbers are different between a physical
measurement and software some of it is
of course that software is relying on
what the CPU tells it what it's gauges
are telling it internally and going from
the back of the board to the socket or
to the CPU die level we enter an area
where the resistance of the connection
of pins to pads could be throwing off
those numbers and it is quite clearly so
ideally the board vendors get things to
a point where LLC isn't crazy aggressive
when Auto and that voltages are close to
what you put in as an input but as long
as you're just kind of aware of
everything and read what you can on the
boards you should be fine
the biggest thing is that typing in a
number if MD says or gigabyte or ace use
anyone if anyone says something like
1.25 is safe
1.3 is safe you have to know what their
what they're talking about because if
you're saying 1.25 is safe
is that 1.25 read at the back of the
board in reality or is it 1.25 as in the
number that you type in to get things
stable because depend on what their
perspective is they might mean the
number you type in or they might mean in
reality and they're talking reality but
you type in a high number you could end
up far over what they consider to be
safe and that just comes down to
communicating with the manufacturers
some of them have websites dedicated to
overclocking so check those but all this
kind of made sense to do now just
because Raven Ridge and Verizon in
general but Raven Ridge is pretty easy
to overclock and D although we don't
like software overclocking at all Andy's
done well to make rise and master at
least kind of work for end users to some
extent most the time so it's not great
BIOS is better if you can do it but in
terms of accessibility to the end user
Rhys masters pretty accessible and it
lets you change things that would be
potentially bad for you to change if you
don't know what you're doing whereas a
lot of software solutions don't give you
that control it tends to be in bios so
yeah so worth talking about because
Raven Ridge is pretty easy to overclock
and most this information applies
generally as knowledge to everything
else so if you like this type of
coverage as always you can subscribe to

kill your motherboard next this was sort
of how to kill your CPU and that'll be
