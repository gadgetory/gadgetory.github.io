office in part one of our moving vlog
series we showed you what we were
working with and it was pretty it was
pretty bad we don't have a whole lot of
space there so we're moving into this
space I don't want anyone to worry and
think that like because we have a rent
obligation now that the content quality
will go down or anything like that this
is very within our budget and the big
thing here is that I have been
completely unable to build out more test
benches the reason the fan tests are
delayed power supply tests are delayed
all of that is because we're out of
space there's no more space where we are
now so this will enable us in a lot of
ways to expand our technical content you
may have seen Patrick's workstation in
part one of this it's not even a
permanent workstation so he brings his
laptop in and sets it up there's a test
bench there sometimes you can even work
there so we're gonna solve all those
problems with this space and the plan
here today it's just while it's empty
show you what it looks like now so we
can transition to what it will look like
once the moving series is all over
before that this video is brought to you
by Corsairs HS 70 wireless gaming
headset which focuses on comfort with
memory foam adjustable ear cups and a
padded headband the headset has a 40
foot low latency range over wireless
lasts for up to 16 hours of gaming use
and as extra focus on build quality to
ensure it lasts a long time
learn more at the link in the
description below alright so first thing
to do is show you where you're gonna
actually see me standing most of the
time which will be the video set so what
I need you to do is work with me here
use your imagination
basically we're thinking a roll set
right behind me here and here's the big
thing permanent live streaming set up
next to it so this is cool in a lot of
ways one livestreams have been really
popular everyone seems to have loved
them thank you very much for watching
them we enjoy doing them a lot too and
right now it takes about two hours of
setup and teardown just to get the live
stream going because we have to move
multiple monitors on top of the table
the wobbly table which will probably be
replaced and then we have to move
multiple systems in streaming system
testbench system and that's problem so
what we're going to do is have basically
like a divider somewhere he
probably not a physical divider but
there'll be a space here and there'll be
the normal a roll set with the blue tool
tool wall and some kind of table in
front of me for where I'm working and
then over here we're gonna do what I'm
thinking is workbench against the wall
probably thirty inch deep workbench here
and then another work table in front of
me and maybe like a rolling cart and the
rolling cart will be so that I can grab
the test batch from one of the other
rooms and wheel it over and we can do
our live streaming setup that way so be
really easy to transport stuff but yeah
table here basically bench there and
maybe a shelf somewhere and then if I
need tools I just walk over to a roll
set and grab them and whoever's Manning
the camera can pan over and catch that
instead of what we normally do where I
literally have to duck under he the
lights I have to duck under cables for
the lights sometimes will crawl under
the table if there's not stuff under it
going into different rooms or downstairs
in the house to grab tools and stuff
like that's problem - you can't do that
during live streams so this will solve
all of that and basically we'll be able
to do live streams more frequently
without eating into the normal content
because right now to do a live stream
take so much setup and teardown time
that's just not feasible to do it all
the time so this will actually be a net
positive and our time available even
though we'll be doing more live streams
that's really cool so yeah permanent
live stream a will set in front of me
here I'll just be lights tripod stuff
like that but like I said right now we
can't navigate the lights without like
like docking and weaving around them so
there'll be enough space here to
actually do that without tripping and
knocking things over and also we can
upgrade eventually not immediately but
eventually upgrade our lighting setup if
we want it to like add an extra light
somewhere or something like that to make
the shops look better so we have a lot
of options there so that's the main
studio area is kind of this just between
me and the camera right now is where the
studio is gonna be and I'll talk a
little bit about some of the other stuff
so over here we have
the obviously kitchen slash break room
whatever some tables that we brought in
but I ignore those for now so basics
here the part that's relevant to you all
is probably about where I'm standing but
not positive yet we might do some kind
of interview table thinking like bar
height bar stool height tables so the
goal isn't necessarily to make it look
like a literal bar it's just that that
setup will be really nice for camera so
we're thinking aside from obviously
being able to use the table to eat and
take a break is when we bring out guests
like I've spoken to you build Zoid about
potentially getting him out here for
some Alan to overclocking spoken with
some vendors and manufacturers who have
expert Alan to overclockers engineers
stuff like that so we want to bring
people out and do videos with that mom's
site and do interviews with experts
basically to expand the technical depth
of the channel and part of that will be
getting a set up here I can just sit
down with them and a somewhat casual set
up I don't know maybe camera back here
somewhere and film out this way and
that'll show the normal a role and
livestream sets in the background
pretty nice background good depth of
field and to have a somewhat informal
area to speak with guests and expand our
technical reach and the content and I'm
still going to be working the really
long hours like whenever we have a major
launch it's definitely possible that
I'll be in here for 24 hours plus at a
time so to accommodate that I need a
couch and we don't have the budget for a
massive beanbag room like some some
people in the space but we're gonna do a
couch by just right here and I don't
know need fridge obviously food stuff so
that's all pretty basic I'll show you
the other rooms briefly I'm not going to
talk about what's in them yet we'll kind
of look at that stuff as we're going
through the moving part of the vlog
either at the end of this video and the
next one will show you kind of the
move-in process and what's going in
there but we have this one so this room
is one of the bigger ones and there's
obviously a bit of echo right now in all
these rooms but as we fill everything in
the cool thing with sound is that the
waves sound waves will break apart as we
put stuff into
intercept them so we'll be filled with
stuff all of these rooms yeah they're
gonna have just like cases whatever in
them so that'll that'll deal with the
echo we have right now this is one of
the rooms show you what's in it later we
can go into one of the other two right
now
and check that out as well so this is
one of the other rooms that we we're
gonna be working with it is it's not
huge but it's a very good size just to
give perspective right now this room
alone is even though it's not even a big
room it's slightly bigger than the main
production we work at right now where
it's not uncommon that three of us will
be working in there at a time and I mean
the other day Patrick's chair was
hitting my chair while we were working
so gives you an idea for space so this
room alone is bigger than our main
production right now and again we're not
going crazy not spending an
irresponsible amount of money on space
but anything is a huge upgrade and this
is a huge upgrade so anyway it's got a
just a server rack except it's only the
front of it so it's got old rack mat
this is all old stuff from the previous
tenants so this will be replaced but I
don't know if we'll put in a real server
rack or not I don't know if we're going
full Lynas with the server or if we're
just gonna keep working out of NASA's or
custom builds whatever you'll hear about
it as we go through all of that but
anyway yeah that came with the space
might not use it it's bolted into the
floor which is kind of cool they
actually installed it properly they have
an ESD mat down there that's grounded
but we'll do whatever we want with the
space eventually so that may go but
that's kind of gives you an idea of
what's already in here so this is the
last room this room comes with a
pre-installed whiteboard which when we
were talking out where stuff goes
everyone seems to come back to the fact
that this room had a whiteboard in it
even though we can install one wherever
we want it's a nice whiteboard though I
don't hopefully is it but this is a it's
a decent sized room again just like the
previous two it's about the same size or
slightly bigger than our existing
production room and so that'll give us a
give us plenty of options for working
with the space but those are the main
three rooms there's one more thing I
want to show in the kitchen area that I
just remembered that's worth pulling out
from the previous tenants so the last
thing I think Patrick maybe Patrick and
Keegan discovered when we
here the other day this is left over
from the previous occupants from who
knows how long ago but it's a Windows XP
professional installation guide for
compact pcs and I think this will
actually come in in great use for us
it's also old old like telecom stuff in
here so we're not gonna be using any of
the switchboards that you saw in the
other room with the server rack of
course but I guess someone did at one
point so anyway give you some provenance
for the office and I guess how long the
previous tenants were in here or
something like that I don't know I don't
really know what to make of it but
that's the whole space let us know what
you think we have a pretty good idea of
where stuff's gonna go there's still
room to change things if you have an
idea that you think is amazing and you
want us to look in to post it below so
that we can look into it before we start
moving everything and that's it for now
as always store document access net to
pick up one of our shirts like this blue
print shirt we have a black version of
it as well now that we're calling
chalkboard you patreon.com slash gamers
Nexus tops that directly really looking
forward to the new content push with all
the technical stuff because we'll have
space for it so that you were sticking
with us subscribe for more as always
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
