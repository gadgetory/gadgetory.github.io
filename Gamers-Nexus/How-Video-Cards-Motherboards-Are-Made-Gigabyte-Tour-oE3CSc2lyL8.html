right now in Taiwan and what we're
looking at is a couple of SMT line
machines so the surface mount technology
this is where motherboards are built and
assembled by gigabyte before getting to
that all this coverage is brought to you
by Roseville and their new case lineup
that we saw at Computex just moments ago
so what we've got here first of all this
is the first machine in the line that
we've looked at this one is applying
some of the paste to the board so it's
preparing the board for the next part of
the line and as you can see in the
b-roll it's basically just laying it on
thick and then the board rolls through
here it's pulled through automatically
by effectively robotic arms conveyed
down the line and the next machines in
the series apply all the different
components so the next machines will
pick up and walk over there and these
ones are for the service mount
components so this machine ax is used
for applying the different resistors and
the BIOS chip the actual physical black
square the firmware chip chipset all
those individual parts I sees all that
stuff is just planted down firmly right
here onto the board after the previous
line which was applying the paste and
compound or things like that so this is
the second part of the line it gets the
board moving through and eventually hits
the third part which we'll look at next
so the third machine of the line is
effectively a giant oven this one you
can see the motherboard is rolling out
behind me and they're going straight
that way into the next set of machines
the oven is reflowing for the solder so
you may have heard the term reflow for
solder with regards to laptops or
repairing GPUs that have been warmed to
a point that the solder has effectively
melted this gets the solder prepared set
in place reflow as they say and the
boards are coming through now I can
actually see on the board it's got the
chipset on it it's got the socket
protector all of the contact points are
there for the mounting of things like
the pin out for the 24 pin header all
that stuff is on there now but we don't
actually have the plastic on there yet
so that's coming up very soon so the
next machine in the line is this one it
looks like a machine gun you can see the
whole belt of capacitors feeding in and
they're being punched onto the
motherboard by this moving head back
here behind me so pretty cool stuff is
actually just
pounds all these capacitors into the
board it moves around seeks on the board
and plants them where they belong based
on the designs that are put into the
computer here behind me and then this
moves further down the line where
technicians and operators will manually
place other board components you can see
that in the b-roll things like headers
and pieces of plastic that are required
for power and stuff like that so that is
further down the line so at this point
up until this machine all the components
have been more or less added to the
board but they're not actually secured
on the board just yet and that's done
with solder so the parts roll up here at
a slight incline and on this ramp
there's just you can see the solder sort
of pouring off the the bottom here so
that's applying all the components more
firmly to the board and it runs just for
an idea at two hundred and sixty seven
Celsius are pretty hot the upward motion
here is just applying basic gravity to
keep the parts sort of down on the board
they're checked again down this way and
they were checked previously over here
by technicians who make sure
everything's secure once it is noted as
secure rolls to the machine keeps going
down the line all right so this pretty
much brings us to the conclusion of the
gigabyte factory tour for now we'll be
back with more depth in the future
probably but for this quick overview of
how the factory works this is pretty
much the end it's the packing line so
the whole line includes technicians and
machines the machine behind me is
actually coming down and punching a box
so these boxes are provided in this flat
sheets flat sheet of cardboard it's got
all the art already applied to it that's
already been done and at this point it
rolls in arm comes out and punches it
and it folds into the correct shape and
then that is rolled onto the line as a
box that's open and prepared at which
point the technicians will begin adding
the motherboards to the conveyor belts
they roll down the line as a unit next
technician applies the foam the
anti-static foam they'll put the board
into the ESD bag or the Faraday cage and
that's all done by hand it's not done by
machines so it is a pretty steady pace
moving on the conveyor belt and all done
manually from here at the very end of
the line is a packing machine
basically check the box is added into
another box for shipping and that rolls
through a machine that applies packing
tape straight down the top of the box
down the center as we saw in our ages
old Kingston factory tour so that more
or less wraps up the gigabyte factory as
always more information on the channel
and on the website gamers nexus net
thanks for watching patreon link the
postal video if you want helps out with
our next efforts I'll see you all next
