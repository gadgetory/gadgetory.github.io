access dotnet and today we're looking at
Zuma tags ZBOX en 760 I really have to
sneeze
it is not working I'm looking at the
light and it's not working so we're just
gonna roll with this and see what
happens this is the em7 60d box the Z
box looks like this if you're curious
where the Z box is it is basically an
HTP see a home theater PC also known as
a mini PC Enzo tags branding they've
been making these for a few years now
I've seen them at PAX East for at least
three years and thus far they haven't
really made a gaming grade one this is a
gaming grade one so I am told the Z box
is a custom form factor mini PC it's a
little bit smaller than many ITX it's
got a CPU on board it's got a GPU
soldered on board you install your own
RAM and hard drive they also saw one
with those pre-installed but let's let's
run through all the specs of this and
then talk about why I have not yet
benchmarked this and what you can expect
when I do benchmark it so for the specs
this like I said has a mobile GPU it is
using an nvidia 860 m which is one of
their maxwell GPUs they actually have
two 860 m as one is based on Kepler and
one is based on Maxwell this to my
knowledge is the Maxwell GPU and that is
also why we're having issues with the
drivers right now the CPU is an i5 its
Intel Core i5 4200 u which is another
laptop component it operates natively at
1.6 gigahertz and turbo boost up to two
point 60 gigahertz if you are wondering
if that is slow the answer is yes one
point six is pretty slow but if turbo
boost works like it should and and jumps
up to two point six when gaming then
will be an okay shape because the GPU
will make up for the rest for the most
part for most games obviously there are
some games that will be more CPU bound
than others but the Z box right now does
not function with n videos three 3078
drivers so unfortunately I can't
benchmark II yet I do have benchmarks
coming but I'm just waiting on ZOTAC to
get back to me with the updated driver
compatibility so the main issue here is
that right now it's running on three
20.6 I want to say which is it's a
little bit old at this point
and unfortunately if I benchmark on
three 20.6 with the 860m against all of
our other video cards you're gonna see a
huge disparity that doesn't actually
exist in hardware it's entirely on the
driver side because all the other cards
I benchmarked on three 37.8 and you I
want to use watchdogs for the bench but
it's not going to work without the
newest drivers because of a million
reasons I've discussed if you have seen
my diatribe on watch times so we are
waiting for the benchmarks on that but
we can at least look at the internals
today and get an overview of what the Z
box is so this is targeted as a gaming
unit in terms of i/o let me just read
off the back here we have four USB 3.0
ports there are two on the back one on
the side slash top however you look at
it and then one on the opposite side
from the back which I suppose would be
the front so that's what we have for the
USB IO there's no USB 2 it's all three
there are two 3.5 milimeter jacks for
out and input there's a four and one
card reader so that includes your SD
SDHC SDXC all of those things and then
we have Wi-Fi antennas included with the
Z box so it actually has its own
wireless card internally you don't need
to buy a USB stick for wireless which is
good because we only have 4 USB ports
and then we have a like I said wired
wireless receiver there's a power button
antenna connector for more antennas
there's an optical spoof which is one of
my favorite words to say so that is an
optical reader for audio of course if
you want to use it in a proper HTPC
setup where you would have high quality
speakers 2 rj45 Ethernet ports and then
we've got a DVI port and HDMI port
another antenna connector for the second
wireless antenna and DC power input so
it actually connects to an adapter that
connects to the wall so it doesn't have
an internal power supply it's actually
external that's how you can make this so
small and the unit that I have here is
the I believe it is
in 760 whereas the more expensive unit
is the en 760 plus so the difference
between them is the 760 does not come
with RAM or a harddrive pre-installed
the 760 plus does and the pre-installed
Graham is one stick of eight gigabytes
at 1600 megahertz the hard drive
pre-installed is a one terabyte drive at
5400 rpm so I would advise you strongly
to buy this model which has nothing
pre-installed why your own RAM by your
own SSD and go from there this unit
chips at $550 should be available later
this month and the pro model with the
RAM and drive ships have 700 I yeah it
strips at 700 so not the best value if
you're capable of installing your own
Drive and Ram and I'm gonna show you how
to do that right now because it's pretty
darn easy and and then we'll get to the
benchmarks as soon as the drivers are
compatible with this device but for
today we're just gonna install
everything things are pretty simple here
looking internally we have of course the
board there's a giant heatsink with a
small what looks to be perhaps a maybe I
don't know if that's 60 or 80
milliliters but it's a small fan on the
GPU and then next to that we have of
course the wireless adapter and you've
got a port for your drive and underneath
that you can remove that one screw
holding in the drive drive sled we'll
call it underneath that is where the RAM
is installed this is actually laptop Ram
it is so dim Ram and you can basically
take it out of any laptop if you have
one or of course just buy new Ram and it
will take two slots so for maximum
efficacy you can fill both of those
slots right now I've got some some
pretty mediocre Kingston laptop RAM in
here just for testing purposes pop your
RAM in just like a laptop pop the SD
into the sled install it it will connect
to the port's very cleanly do not force
anything because you'll break it
and then just close it off and that's
that's really all there is to it so at
this point
we install an OS we install some games
we hope that the drivers are updated and
then play and and I'll have a benchmark
for you shortly so subscribe to the
YouTube channel for that and of course
check the website for full information
on this product as well as the other
ZOTAC ones and I will see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
