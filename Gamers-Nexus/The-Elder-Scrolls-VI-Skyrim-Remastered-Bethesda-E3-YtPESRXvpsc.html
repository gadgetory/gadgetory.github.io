so far not unexpected and the major one
we're focusing on here today is Beth des
des announcements for e3 going into the
immediate future and there are three
items that Bethesda brought up worth
note the first one Skyrim remastered the
second one the fact that the Elder
Scrolls 6 does and will exist and the
third one is there are two quote major
projects that Beth has is working on but
we don't know what they are so let's
jump into this with Skyrim remastered
the new release comes to PlayStation
Xbox and PC primarily updating visuals
and marking a major progression point
for Bethesda and that's for one main
reason this is the first time at least
that I can remember that the company has
done a full proper refresh of an Elder
Scrolls games look showing this shows
promise that they understand just how
much stained power Skyrim has held and
update also enables mods on consoles and
on PC through a more user-friendly and
in-game interface so no scattering
remastered does not in any way
invalidate Ahmad's it doesn't break
existing mods in theory anyway those
Skyrim script extender may need some
updates and the update is largely visual
so the visual updates that they've noted
explicitly include quote remastered art
and effects we're not one hundred
percent sure what that means just yet
but we do know what volumetric cadres
means that's probably what you saw and
fall out through the Nvidia game works
though it is not confirmed or stated
anywhere whether these volumetric god
rays and volumetric lighting effects are
using game works but that is what was
utilized and fallout it does look pretty
good though dynamic depth of field is
also added that has of course existed in
Dinah vision and other mods forever now
but it is coming officially to Skyrim
screen space reflections are coming to
Skyrim and then there are new snow and
water shaders in a burst year form of
the rest of the Bethesda news game
director Todd Howard spoke on youtubes
live III coverage and said this of the
Elder Scrolls 6 really not surprising
but he did say that's the kind
of elephant in the room I think it's
good to tell our fans in these moments
yes of course we are making the Elder
Scrolls 6 and he went on to say that the
game can't really be described right now
it has no real technology finalized and
things are still in flux so that's all
we got is basically yes Bethesda's
working on it can't tell you anything
else so we do know that it exists it's
been quite a long time since the skyrim
release that was two thousand eleven 11
11 11 that marked us at about five years
now and that is around what it takes by
that is to make it game normally but
they're taking longer this time
apparently and maybe that's part of why
we're seeing this remastered release now
other news just very briefly in that
same interview todd howard did say that
they're working on two other major
projects and indicated that we will be
privy to those projects before the Elder
Scrolls 6 is officially shown and
announced none of thats really didn't
really seem super official when he was
saying it kind of off the cuff but it
does sound like will know about two
other major Bethesda projects pretty
soon so that's what we got for you for
bethesda at e3 be sure to subscribe
patriotic special video and we'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
