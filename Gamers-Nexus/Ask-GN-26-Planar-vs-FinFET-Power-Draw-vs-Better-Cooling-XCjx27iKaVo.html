ask G and today we've got some questions
on process manufacturing process CPUs
and their impact on 120 Hertz 1 40 Hertz
displays when you're looking at FPS
talking about beat bending for CPUs and
GPUs stuff like that so as always
questions below in the comments if you
have questions we're joined obviously by
senior AMD analyst snowflake so now
would be a good time to post your
questions relevant to that but questions
below GPU other components all welcome
cases CPUs all that stuff Ram this
content is brought to you by I way power
and their new element gaming PC with arc
LED fans underglow and a large tempered
glass side window so first question this
verse sparse of d I don't know how to
say your name sorry ask what is the
difference between a 14 nanometer
planner and 40 nanometer FinFET to go
into that in depth would would be a
whole separate video but just to really
briefly go over things the first part of
that question 14 nanometers that is the
size of the process so the manufacturing
process basically the tools used to make
the components make the all the stuff
that goes into your CPU your GPU so when
you're looking at 14 nanometer that's
what that's referring to its referring
to how physically large the manufacturer
number refers to a size of the process
and the next part planar versus FinFET
refers to sort of the the type of design
for the gates and the transistors so
when you're looking at FinFET the the
fin part you can think of it like a
literal thin from an animal so the gates
basically surrounding the gate there's
raised thin on the sides like that and
we have images of them so raise fin
around the gate and that helps trap
basically your power so there's less
power leakage this way other benefits
too but power leakage is one of the big
ones that and the N Nvidia are harping
on for this generation so that reduction
of power leakage is because it is
trapped by effectively a wall
found the gates and that's something we
talked about in the gp100 architecture
deep dive if you're curious about that
and that isn't a video forum as well
next question I by the way that's super
top level but I hope that answers the
basics a planar by the way all planar
means is flat so just like planner and
any other instance planner means flat
versus FinFET where it's kind of 3d not
the same as a 3d transistor from Intel
but we can use the words 3d and 2d to
give a basic understanding the next
question is from ikea dune he says can
you talk about if it's true that 120
Hertz and 144 hurts are actually CPU
intensive that's it's kind of a vague
question the very basics of it by nature
of drawing more frames you are going to
be hitting the CPU more frequently every
time the CPU gets hit or every every
time I frame is drawn to the screen
there's work done by the GPU and the CPU
so the CPU has to do work on every
single frame just like the GPU does and
that's especially cool true if it's if
it's something like the x11 or something
opengl where draw calls are hitting the
cpu more noticeably so in that instance
the answer would be yes 120 Hertz and
144 hurts insofar as drawing frames at
that speed would actually certainly be
more intensive when you're looking at
games and that's that's true for CPU and
GPU but CPU more probably than people
think that's the top level next question
very very simple from t-mo for life says
what's Bend I think we talked up bend
chips in the last episode so when I
asked about does asus been there strict
chips for use so the answer what's bend
bending is a process of selecting
it's a selective process for going
through the silicon that's output from a
factory given to manufacturers from the
supplier so bending happens at a couple
levels one is at the initial creation of
the chip it's kind of tested and
validated canvas should perform to spec
does it have anything needs to be
disabled if there are things that need
to be disabled you end up with stuff
like the g3 258 where
igp is disabled or the athlon x4 series
where the APU the graphics part of the
APU is disabled so those things come
about as a result of failing validation
or just needing to fill a gap in the
market the other part of bending is when
you look at a manufacturer board partner
in the case of GPUs EVGA AC set aside
gigabyte all of them have more or less
the same process so just choosing a high
end card like a cane pen or something of
that nature that those kind of super
high-end cards will be selectively
chosen because the chip quality is not
the same from product to product so if
we have two 1080s I don't know what this
is actually 1080 very convenient so we
have two 1080s from the same manufacture
the same make and model say we have two
of these exact cards they will not
overclocked the same and the chip
quality will be different almost
certainly between the two that's because
there's imperfections of the
manufacturing process like any other
silicon is very very selective in its in
its function so when you have
differences in manufacturing process you
have differences in overclock potential
and things like that stability at
different clock rates if there's failed
validation that might get down steps to
a lower end product which we've seen in
the past when you can kind of unlock a
GPU from a low NGP to a higher NGP
that's normally because something in
there is not performing the spec of the
high end so that's why that happens so
binning is the process of selecting
components by someone in the line
selling it to you it's not something
that consumer does some of the lines
selling it to you is selecting
components to perform based on a speck
normally its associated with high end
meaning that they bend it to be a better
overclocking next question is from
Jordan cave jordan says hi Steve my
question is does water cooling reduce
CPU or GPU power consumption for the
same sustained clocks when compared the
standard air cooling no so reducing your
thermals all your it's it's still
outputting the same amount of heat still
drawing the same amount of power when
you put a higher end
or on a component like when we put
liquid on these things actually right
there there's your example so when we
put liquid on one of these things the
GPU is still drawing other than the
added power for the pump which we can
ignore the GPU itself is still drawing
the same amount of power so it does not
reduce power consumption does not reduce
the heat that the component is capable
of generating but what changes is the
dissipation ability of the cooler so
with a better cooler on there because in
this case we're using a copper cold
plate very conductive it's about 400
watts per meter Kelvin at 25c copper
cold plate sinks heat away from the GPU
from the silicon into a chamber through
which liquid runs and dissipates it babe
yeah carries it up to the radiator and
all that stuff that we've talked about
before so the dissipation potential is
far greater on one of these that means
all that really all that means is that
your GPU itself will perform at a lower
temperature which does impact a lot can
impact life it can impact the overclock
potential depending on how hot it's
getting before the better coolers
applied and generally just changes kind
of stability of the clock so if you look
at clock rate versus time charts you'll
see that the clock rate does dip a bit
when it hits throttle points like 83
Celsius on the 1080 silicon so that's
the main thing that that better coolers
change as far as power consumption if
you kind of build an all liquid system
versus all air let's just ignore the
power required for the fans the pumps
ignoring that the components will draw
the same amount of power so that's
that's more or less how it works there
may be some efficiency differences in
there but it's going to be really small
so we'll ignore that next question is
from Chris sue who says I was a long
question the short of it how long do you
test your a iOS if viendo CP cooler
bench when we do we haven't done it in a
while for publication but I'm actually
working on some of that now so how do we
test the all-in-ones further says a oh
hi yes so basically saying that a iOS
can take a bit longer to heat up then
something like an air cooler which is
true because you have a coolant in here
as well
so the coolant does take time to heat up
it's not going to be the same
temperature as the cold plates or
anything they're all kind of different
temperatures within a range of each
other some cooler manufacturers have
specs for TC 60 CE whatever they've got
the specification where they won't allow
their coolant to exceed that temperature
or well I should say not won't allow
because I could certainly happen if you
really tried but within normal use
scenarios they won't allow it to exceed
a certain temperature that's for many
reasons mostly longevity permeation of
the tubes things like that evaporation
but answering the question how long do
we test them for cooler ties that we do
two types of tests so when looking at
most things like GPUs CPUs whatever the
first test is an endurance test that
runs for two hours it runs with metro
last light on loop basically infinitely
until we conclude the test it's all
scripted starts and stops shuts down on
all its own starts off the logging on
its own that two-hour period is looked
at that generates the overtime charts
temperature versus time temperature and
frequency for is a time of the CP and
the GPU it's all important metrics to
know because if the cooler is not
performing adequately you could be
hitting thermal throttle points or your
temperature could be varied enough that
the CPU kind of freaks out in down
clocks temporarily GPU also so that's
part of it the second part is a shorter
test runs 25 minutes we've found through
a lot of testing over the last year's 25
minutes is basically perfect for case
cooler any GPU fan all that testing
basically perfect it's enough time to
saturate whatever is whatever the cooler
is liquid or otherwise and from there we
pull data averaged from a point in the
spreadsheet on word for the load and
then from an earlier point to the
beginning of this house for idle so
that's the basics of it next question is
icebergs hi Jan I have a soundblaster
audigy two zs platinum on an 8320 i'm a
sigh 970 motherboard is it every day and
it's better than my onboard and he's
saying I want to upgrade I still want to
use these
sound card for the audio card the sound
blaster audio card what can I do to keep
it upgraded so icebergs here is looking
at a PCI Express x1 2 dual pci riser and
asking if there's going to be
degradation and audio quality generally
no because the the sound card is not
going to saturate the throughput
potential of that interface it's not
fast enough if you buy a really crappy
quality pci riser then you probably
might have some loss but most that loss
will be from poorly insulated cabling or
something like that so just by something
that that's decent don't spend too
little on it because you don't want to
lose either lose performance through
they wired it poorly and the electricals
bad and there's not enough throughput
which I've seen or it's just again wired
poorly or there's EMI or some kind of
crosstalk and so you're losing
performance audibly just through
introducing crosstalk and basically
static those the only two things to look
out for you all need to worry about
cable like a performance degradation
over cable length if you're not running
a really long cable anything that within
reason if it's if it's something you can
fit in your case without winding the
cable several times then you'll be fine
so I wouldn't really worry about it
sound maybe if you did that for a video
card then you can have some performance
degradation if you're doing it for and
even then even we've shown like one
percent difference in some cases you'd
have to do it for like multiple SLI
setup 4-way SLI or something so I
wouldn't worry about it that's all for
this video oh wait now we got one more
last one was from himanshu got a guy
concur Oh parenthetically the Iron Man
excellent ok so the iran in parenthesis
says hey gamer nexus i guess i guess
that's me how can i get long hair like
yours don't cut it so that's all for
this time eh on like the postural video
subscribe for more content all that
stuff leave your questions below I opens
everything for GPU CPUs k
is all this stuff I'm only saying that
because we've had several episodes like
GPU only so feel free to post about any
components not just GPUs but I'll see
you all next time
you
