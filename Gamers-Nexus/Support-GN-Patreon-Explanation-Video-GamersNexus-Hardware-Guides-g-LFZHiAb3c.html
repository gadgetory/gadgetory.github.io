Nexus dotnet and this is the video for
our new patreon page I've got about
$1,500 worth of hardware behind me right
now and what we want to do is produce
several in-depth videos talking about
components and I don't just mean the
motherboard I mean the capacitors the
BRM the MOSFETs and talking about what
it means to you as a consumer these
videos aren't easy and the conventions
we go to are expensive patreon makes our
ability to deliver content more feasible
patreon is sort of like Kickstarter
except it's inverse to your increments
for people who produce content more
frequently with Kickstarter you might
give $20 or $50 at a time for a project
but with patreon you can tip one dollar
at a time for five dollars at a time or
whatever amount you want
and we usually release a few hardware
guide videos per month so you'd be
tipping offering each of those videos we
release you can also set a maximum
amount you're willing to tip per month
so if we release a lot of videos you
won't go over them out
supporters help keep us going but I want
to make sure you're rewarded for being
involved with GM so I'll keep a
subscribers only patreon blog where you
can see what I'm working on as I'm
working on it or if you're working on a
PC project and need an expert advice I
can connect you with industry experts or
get answers for you as an extra bonus if
you need advice on getting into the
games industry or hardware industry I
can help with that too so I hope you're
all as excited as I am to learn more
about computer hardware and I will see
you all next time
peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
