the AC suite now and this was probably
in terms of technology one of the most
trivial products we've covered however
for whatever reason a lot of you wanted
us to cover this further because we
posted a short news story and there was
a surprising amount of interest in it
before that this video is brought to you
by Leon Lee and their 550 X and 330
cases the 550 X is a $180 mid-tower case
with tempered glass on all panels it's
got three RGB LED fans positioned in the
front each of which has a metal frame
housing and an open interior design if
you prefer a cheaper option the 330 is
$100 and comes without fans and is what
we recommended it most heavily in one of
our recent case reviews learn more at
the link in the description below so
this is what they're calling a bezel
free kit it's pretty straightforward
from the top level and actually the
level it's it's just straightforward
three monitors and you've got basically
an acrylic glass so this is officially
it's a PMMA plastic so it's a poly
methyl acrylic basic methacrylate so
it's an acrylic glass and it's a 130
degree angle for each of these displays
that is the only angle these will work
at they have a mount on the top and the
bottom that specifically fits that
viewing angle so you won't be able to
sort of widen it out if you wanted but
at this angle it works pretty well and
we have before-and-after shots if you
want to see a comparison for yourself
the camera shows it pretty well so it's
it's pretty basic we don't know the
price yet it should be reasonably
affordable it's acrylic and plastic
mounts they come off pretty easily
basically just pull and that's that's it
reasonably flexible or reasonably sturdy
and 130 degree viewing angles so they
they have discussed the option of adding
this to larger monitors than this one I
think it fits officially 25 inch it
should fit 24 27 and 32 as well but for
now it sits on these PG 25 8q monitors
so price TBD and launch quarter 2
sometime so that's what we know about
the bezel freak it just kind of a neat
thing I want to know what you all think
though so leave a comment below on this
one and then we're gonna move over to a
species B FGD which we already looked at
the BFG DS but there's a reason I'm
revisiting it so we'll go over to that
one next
so the BFG D we showed this already once
at the Nvidia suite but it was a
different model was the HP model the
reason I'm showing it again is because
that did not have a framerate counter on
it and we've heard rumors so I want to
check out the one Asus has here and Asus
because of some rules with Nvidia we
weren't allowed to change any settings
resolution or anything like that
however testing games you learn a few
tricks like the skybox being basically
infinite framerate for most the most
part so we tested this one and it does
actually go over hundred FPS so it's at
least it's hitting 101 102 at that point
you're basically there we're just
limited by 4k at this point so it was
not constrained to 98 on the Asus model
which is the only real reason I wanted
to look at this again because I mean
even just right here we're hitting over
85 and then once we have the b-roll of
looking at the skybox directly it's
going over 100 so the very least we have
that it is functional on the higher
refresh side if anyone was curious
because the Nvidia demo was pretty
restricted and had no framerate counter
and they didn't let us touch the monitor
or touch the OSD or anything else we
also were allowed to get some shots of
the back side of the Asus display so
this is the PG 65 for anyone curious and
on the back side it's actually got two
active cooling fans I don't think that
noise should really be a concern because
maybe sitting far away it's on the back
and yes but there's two active cooling
fans back there right now
it's got a couple of i/o ports USB three
I think it's two of them at least and
then there's another USB 3 type
support as well so pretty standard stuff
from the connection standpoint but we
can't show you the OSD right now and all
I can really say is that it's actually
properly running at 4k 120 because for
this demo we were allowed to do a little
bit more with newer with the Nvidia demo
so if you had any skepticism 25% of it
should be quelled now but the rest we'll
look at later when the time comes as
always you can subscribe for more go to

directly and thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
