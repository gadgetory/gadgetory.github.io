gone with with their new md's mcp uses a
first one out of the gate that's really
been detailed under the Sun architecture
risin is a combination we're told of
horizon and Zen which at least there's a
reason for the naming but it's not
really what's important here what's
important here so we have some
preliminary information on the caching
the speed and the core count things like
that some of its already really been
discussed for a long time now so it's
even been confirmed but we'll go over
what was shown at the horizon event
before getting to that this content is
brought to you by Corsair and they're
270 our case which is about a
sixty-dollar mid tower ATX form factor
enclosure that has really easy to use
these of installation features and makes
first time building it pretty straight
forward link in the description below
for more information on that so back to
rise n here's the thing we're looking at
today first of all this is all coming
out of the horizon event that was live
streamed via YouTube by Andy officially
and recapping the most important stuff
we already know that Zen is using a
victim cache it was sort of discussed
again briefly and it's fully associative
so this means that you're really only
losing one cycle of performance if you
have a cache miss and that's important
but this has been at least loosely known
on the perimeter for some time now some
Zen architectural details have already
been published officially by the way not
just leaks so that's kind of known but
it is victim cache that was confirmed
here 20 megabytes l2 plus l3 this
improves latency and that's kind of a
big thing that Andy's pushing forward
with this architecture the latency
reductions made are across three
different things so cash is one of them
and then just in the switching frequency
switching boosting and down clocking and
stuff as necessary to better work with
whatever the current workload on the CPU
is so those are main things improving
latency is also being done through
better prefetching and through better
predictions branch prediction things
like this that are really buzzwords for
most major CPU architectures in the
modern era but are coming up in full
force with Zen because again if we look
kind of back in time with AMD cpus they
haven't had any really major
architectures and quite
some time now the APU chips were really
the main area we've seen innovation FX
although it has received refreshes and
updates the architecture has really not
been that different since bulldozer
piledriver steam roller at all had some
changes but Zen is the first really
truly major step for AMD since many
years to cut at this point so to that
end prefetching is a big thing that they
were talking about and branch prediction
this reduces hopefully reduces the
requirement of shuffling data around is
shuffling your whatever you're working
with at the time between the cash on the
CPU package and the system memory so
with better prediction that's hopefully
lessened movement of the data and
therefore improve the latency because if
you're transacting everything locally on
the chip and you don't have to reach
outward to get it or you're not ditching
things in cash that could actually be
useful in a moment then obviously you
improve your processing time and this
for those of you who have followed our
GPU coverage when we talk about the
architectures of both Polaris and Pascal
it's a similar trend there now two very
different things in terms of what you're
actually designing it to do but the
steps and improvement are pretty much in
the same area so we've got reduced
latency and you've got better boost
functionality that's the next major
point talk about with Zen and
specifically with the rise in CPU that
we saw briefly at the event so the
improved frequency boosting or
management you can call it similar to
what GPUs do reisen will basically look
at the current workload and then add a
1000 to Hertz interval it so a thousand
times per second it can modulate the
frequency to match the workload now this
is important because really other than
sort of benchmarking and overclocking
scenarios things like that you don't
want to blast your CPU at one hundred
percent of its complete maximum clock
capabilities all the time because it's
just not power efficient there's no real
point to do that if you're doing basic
tasks and this isn't new to the industry
because CPUs have been boosting for a
long time now but the improve
movements are new so risin you're
getting the 1000 Hertz change rate
basically maximum potential change rate
of the frequency from the marketing
materials we have now anyway and it's
got the the base clocks kind of
obfuscated it either it's got a lower
bcl cave and normally or it can change
it basically said 25 megahertz
increments so I don't know if that's a
lower be clk all together and a higher
multiplier or if it's something else
just in terms of the granularity with
which the clock can fluctuate based on
load that I'm not clear on right now and
we won't be for a little while yet but
we are supposed to be briefed on Zen
pretty soon theoretically CES is
generally a time frame where more of
this information would come out so we
might have more of that in very early
January but that's what I got for now so
I'm not sure if it's a lower bc okay and
a higher multiplier or what's going on
there but 25 megahertz intervals is the
the key phrase that they used when
discussing boosting on risin now
boosting the reason i said it's sort of
similar to GPUs is really just because
the parameters under which zen is going
to boost are comparable and that's
because then the risin chip I should say
is equipped with according to md
hundreds of sensors and those sensors do
things that you would expect them to do
their sensors for temperature sensor
voltage down to the millivolt incentive
sensors for wattage down to the mill of
wat and these things look at current
workload current parameters working
conditions of the CPU is it too hot is
it too low that is it low enough voltage
that you could boost the voltage and
increase the clock rate or what's going
on so that's in there that helps with
abuse functionality and with regard to
thermal sensors specifically I suppose
the theory would be that just like the
way both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs will boost
rise n will sort of in some distant
similarity be able to boost if it's got
enough thermal headroom if it says ok I
clearly have plenty of temperature range
here to grow so it can boost its
performance and then does so until hit
some other limitation that's detected by
those on chip sensors is whether that's
voltage or power
or maybe thermal at a later time when
it's boosted higher so that's what
you're looking at there this sort of
ties into dvfs so the dynamic voltage
and frequency scaling the curve dvfs
curve normally is again just because
it's we it's been non-stop GPUs for six
months so you'll excuse me hopefully for
for drawing on that recent memory and
knowledge but again with dbfs the
frequents the curve basically your
voltage and frequency is somewhat tied
together and with risin we're looking at
a lower dvfs where in theory you're
going to get higher clock rates with a
lower voltage or in the very least maybe
not that's a direct higher clock rates
too low voltage but in the very least
you get higher performance per watt and
the the boosting and down clocking
functionality will just hopefully very
aggressively switch depending on the
context so you're not burning power
where it doesn't need to be burned and
that tells us that Andy is taking this
time power consumption a lot more
seriously than the older generation CPUs
that have largely been dying out on the
market so that's a that's a bigger deal
this time that's a good thing because
power consumption is a major deal I mean
even just in mobile that's the only
thing really that matters for a lot of
mobile devices so that is good to see
well we'll have to test it in house and
see how it actually performs
functionality we've kind of gone over
everything that I actually know so far
everything else is either going to be
it's just going to have to wait till
unbreached and we can do a more in-depth
article on the architecture how it works
without speculation release dates and
prices obviously that's the big thing so
reisen quarter won 20-17 still target
launch and then Naples which is the
server variant is still targeted for
quarter two prices i do not have I they
were not announced in the demonstration
md compared their reisen chip which is
eight cores 16 threads at 3.4 gigahertz
against a broad well Egypt the i760 900k
somewhat comparable in clock rate they
compared them head-to-head that's an
expensive Intel chip it's also eight
core 16 threads and the performance with
reisen was effectively identical in some
tasks
were shown to the i760 900k and those
tasks include the handbrake CLI
transcoding functions where they were
more or less tied if not slightly better
on verizon and then a render task with
basically shading and rendering sort of
a 3d modeling program where reisen and
Intel through the broad well each ship
were tied in terms of the time required
to complete the task so it's good news
we have to see again how it performs in
house gaming we were not given any FPS
metrics it was just basically like look
it's a indeterminate how different that
you can't see actually difference
between the two that's not really useful
because if you've locked the frequency
to the display doesn't really tell us
anything other than they can both do 60
Hertz which big deal no 11 surprised
about that so we'll have to wait for
gaming but we do have a baseline for the
rest now I was always wait for our
review and further discussion before
making any purchasing decisions would
say that every time but just worth
putting out there patreon link official
video gonna help us out directly link in
the description below for more
information subscribe for more comment
with your thoughts I'll see you all next
time
