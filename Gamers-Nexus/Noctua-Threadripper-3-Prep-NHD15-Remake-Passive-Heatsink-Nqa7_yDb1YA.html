at Computex 2019 and NOx was always got
some pretty cool stuff at the show last
year we gave them the award for the
least amount of RGB shit at a booth and
so we've returned and once again it
looks like knocked Oh we'll be receiving
that award because I've seen nary an LED
while here so the things at the show
that are of most interest to probably
run into the passive cooler which I've
got in front of me there's an NHD
fifteen sort of I mean I don't want to
say refresh cuz that downplays up but
there's a new NHD 15 that's got that and
that's the big cooler that's probably
iconic and you likely recognize the a a
series fan now in 140 millimeters has
gotten some updates so we have a
prototype on that to talk through and
then there's just some cool testing
setups behind me that I'll mention as
well before that this video is brought
to you by the gigabyte z3 90 ARS master
motherboard which comes equipped with
one of the more powerful z3 90 V RMS for
heavier overclocks on the new 9th Gen
Intel CPUs the ARS master is also one of
the few motherboards with a really
heatsink this generation featuring a mix
of high surface area fins and looks
oriented hover blocks oh and it's also
got updated RDV illumination learn more
at the link below let's start with the
passive cooler so in front of me this
passive cooler set up in the system next
to me there are actually no fans in this
right now in fact they've even gotten a
bit cheeky with it and it says caution
service may be hot because there's zero
fans this can be set up obviously with a
fan if you wanted to there's another
test they did with a finit Wow that
actually is genuinely pretty hot
it is radiating quite a bit at the top
but the cooler so there's no name for it
yet it's just fan li's cooler right now
we'll have a name later the target for
release dates pretty far out so this is
an early prototype and knocked was still
doing a lot of tweaking on it but you'll
notice in b-roll that the fins are
actually spaced pretty far apart this is
intentional when you don't have a fan
with some sort of static pressure to
force air through it through the fin
stack that is you do end up with a worse
scenario for passive cooling so what you
want is a bit of space between each of
the fins and the fin stack the fin
density is lower and that's so that
natural convection can take its course
and you rely on just physics at that
point so pretty simple rather than for
we're seeing all the air through with a
fan and doing it sort of semi manually
so this one right now it's set up
running about 120 watt load with a 9900
K and could run higher with a fan in the
back so I think we heard about 180 watts
with a fan just like a top mounted
exhaust fan or something but 120 watt 99
100 K is really not bad for a passive
cooling solution for the prototype in
front of me this one has 1.5 millimeter
thick aluminum fins so one aluminum
because weight and heavy and you don't
want to rip the socket out of the board
and to that copper at some point doesn't
really do a whole lot for you in in ways
that are meaningful versus the price but
there is still copper coal blades nickel
plated copper heat pipes nickel plated
those are centered and it is using a
pretty widely spaced pin stack what
might change is all of these specs so
it's a prototype first half of 2020
means that anything I've just said is is
subject to change based on naktu as
in-house testing for example the fin
thickness could end up coming down to
something like 0.5 millimeters rather
than 1.5 or you can make me go up to one
it's really up in the air at present but
one of the biggest issues is with the
press so the manufacturing process the
press that a lot of the companies use
like we've seen in our factory tours
recently there there there's big giant
ones that weigh like 150 tons they come
down and smash and stamp the fins and
then sometimes they also contain a setup
that can fold the fins into themselves
to assemble the whole stack in an
automated fashion so now I've to express
stops at 0.5 millimeter thin thickness
which means that going up to 1.5
millimeters poses a production challenge
so Knox we're still trying to figure out
what to do to overcome that because it's
a multi-million dollar investment to
just buy a press that can do 1.5 to 2
millimeter thin thickness those start
well I mean yeah it's it's millions of
dollars so they have to figure out our
solution to that for example they could
end up cutting out the automated
automatic interlocking of the fins and
go with a manual assembly approach that
would do it but that's still all up in
the air and I think that covers
most it so the price target is totally
TBD and Knox would like to see it below
$100 but we're not gonna hold them to
that until we see you know how they
overcome the manufacturing difficulties
for size it's about the same size as an
HD 15 so it's a 165 millimeter tall
cooler from the socket and then the rest
is roughly the same as the D 15 I think
that covers the passive one beyond the
passive cooler which is just a cool tech
demo
I guess we'll talk with the NHD 15
updates next there's a couple and behind
me but this one is the tr4 version which
you can tell by looking at the cold
plate so it's got the wider cold plate
in previous testing when cr4 came out
first gen we found with a 1950 X that
increasing from a same color so like for
like test everything identical just
changing the cold plate size it did
actually have a significant impact and
that's because you've got a larger IHS
and it's spreading the heat so I mean if
you're not contacting the Hawaii chest
you're kind of throwing away some of the
benefit of having a larger IHS the
differences for this one versus
previously the fin density is the same
fan pitch is the same heat pipes have
gone up to seven from six so size is a
bit different it's bit wider and then
for the tr4 version the the spacing for
PCIe was a obviously a major
consideration so to make sure there's
clearance for PCIe the heat pipes have
been moved a little bit versus the
standard models which you can see over
there so it's an asymmetrical heat pipe
layout instead of a symmetrical one it
should be pretty clear on camera TBD on
pricing maybe 20-ish more than the
current units that are out there but
don't hold them to that and then there's
some production level improvements as
well so improvements the heat pipe that
weren't really specified they're still
centered though and then I think there's
a demo behind me running a tr4 system
with the 2990 WX 32 core CPU it's at 440
watch all that really matters is the
amount of heat that's generated not the
frequency cuz it's the goal is cooling
it so for the demo for 40 Watts it is
still running so it's at about an 87
degree TDI right now and just running
prime95 torturously on end and
poor test conditions because I mean it's
against a wall and Convention Center
that's kind of warm so not bad but
that's the TR force the cooler anywhere
the energy 15 and I think the last
there's a couple fans I'll just point
out quickly will show b-roll of this is
gonna be some white fans coming the
black fans are getting finalized for the
a series 120 millimeter cooler and then
the black heat sinks that NOx was shown
a few times now are getting finalized as
well apparently there's some production
challenges with cleaning the solder off
the residue of the solder and then
getting the powder coating on so that's
being finalized still then this fan is
the updated a sit well it's the 140
millimeter a series we talked about this
at Computex last year one year ago and
the difference is that when we talk to
well the difference is everything in the
fan but when we talk to Noctua they were
saying well it's not really so easy as
just scaling it up in CAD and then
making a new fan so there's some
markings on here that indicate that it's
gone through a couple of revisions
different changes things can change like
how many blades you have the thickness
of the blades the sweep of the blade
where the blade starts to sweep down the
hub how close the blade is to the outer
side of it the design on the top of the
blades lots lots and lots of things can
change so that's in prototyping they're
just kind of showing it off to tell you
that it is eventually going to happen
and Knox we could probably make it today
but does want to push a bit more on the
performance side to get a meaningful
improvement so we'll keep you updated on
when that happens I think that covers
the Noctua booth thank you for watching
as always you can subscribe for more
writing at a store now cameras excess
net to help us out directly and
patreon.com/scishow sexist to help us
out there as well I don't have any
awards with me this time unfortunately
cuz they're too heavy but if I had one I
would give one to Noctua for still
having the least amount of RGB shit at a
booth I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
