dotnet and i am joined by scott watson
former tax report and now AMD scott how
long have you been with AMD so far it
just since the beginning of the year so
about 3 39 points yeah very cool and
we're at this capsaicin event here at
GDC before getting into that though all
this coverage from GDC 2016 is brought
to you by raw furious platformer game
goner which you see on screen now so
what's what's sort of the main thing
with the displays we saw this LG display
your time you about can you tell me more
about that and tell people why anyone
should care about it display right now
oh yeah well the coolest demo we have
here in for me and I you know I'm just
into this stuff I'm just geeking out
about this is we have a LG OLED TV it's
a 55 inch TV and it's an HDR capable TV
and what we're showing is a particular
video that finally shows off we've had
some demos of HDR but this one finally
comes together all the elements to show
off what we can do with the next
generation of displays so this thing is
an HDR content video it's 4k resolution
it is high dynamic range it is high
color gamut wide color gamut so it's
more colors you haven't seen on to
display before it is 60 frames per
second so it's super fluid the pans and
stuff and it doesn't do you know and
it's it's tone mapped for the particular
TV that is being shown on so its color
correct and and range correct for that
display and so what you'll see when you
look at it it's something we can't put
on camera because all your equipment
doesn't isn't as good right but but it
is just the best thing I've ever seen on
an electronic display and we're able to
show it running on one of our Polaris
GPUs a little one that we demoed in
Sonoma being decoded videos being
decoded in real time and then sent to
the TV over an HDMI to point out port so
it's sort of the latest of everything
and in this one case this little video
loop shows you the potential for
something that we've been talking about
in terms of color gamut maps and math
and all that but it's here on display so
I'm happy to have it
and this is different from the one that
we saw at CES that right it's it's
really progress on the same front there
wasn't a video this good match to a
display that was high frame rate that we
had to show there and so this is just
better so do the on the gaming side the
developers have to do anything to accent
you know to make use of the displays
yeah so the interesting thing about the
gaming site and we don't have it we have
a demo now but we don't have any games
yet running in HDR but the interesting
thing about that is that because directx
11 is a high-precision API internally
that requires lots of bits of precision
per color channel that really what game
developers need to do is simply tone map
to the higher dynamic range displays all
their lighting engines there's goodness
in them right now and you're not seeing
it because your display isn't capable so
as this stuff moves along I expect that
we'll see games that can tone mapped to
HDR displays and give us more range and
more color and not be like that annoying
bloom that we had in the past that
didn't really work out because the
displays aren't capable enough I think
now we're finally going to have that
promise I you know realized and seeing
just seeing the first video that does it
you get excited about what's coming
what's that what's the resolution of
that display out there it's 4k so i
believe it's 3840 x 2160 ok yeah I was
curious because I almost when I saw them
at CES or the the sort of earlier
version at CES one thing we were talking
about between our staff was I'd almost
rather have the color than 4k if it's
strictly between 4k or 1080 with the
higher oh yeah Holly Collin I totally
agree this is me personally but I would
much rather have high dynamic range high
frame rate wide color gamut then just
more resolution right I think those
things are more impactful and
unfortunately there aren't a lot of
examples of that in a while which is why
I'm happy to show it here but when you
see it you start thinking about your
next TV purchase regardless i just
bought a TV and I saw it a couple days
ago in the lab for the first time and I
was like oh like I don't know man like
this summer new TV that's
that's the problem with working in
attack industry it is but but it's a
beautiful thing let's let's roll over to
frame times for a second so a completely
different topic yeah but you are one of
the you and maybe ryan trout are among
the pioneers for frame time testing our
viewers have seen us do these what we
call 1% low and 0.1 percent low metrics
I've kind of explained some of it but
would you give a top level overview of
why you especially now at AMD vs tech
report think that frame time testing is
important right well the work I did at
the tech report was basically the basis
for its why I'm here right Roger kudo e
who runs the Radeon technologies group
saw that liked what I was doing and
asked me to come and help at AMD so I
think there's a pretty strong
endorsement there right and the idea
behind it was a simple one we tested
games for years and there were times
when you play two games in the average
FPS number or the low FPS number between
sorry play one game with two GPUs those
numbers the FPS numbers look the same
but the experience was not the same you
realize that and I I one point started
looking into that and realized it's a
very simple thing you have to deliver
every frame on time to deliver smooth
animation and an average conducted over
a period of time masks variants that
happens from frame to frame and so you
need have a better metric you need to
look at the entire distribution of frame
times and ask the question you know was
was I getting the frame on time every
time as consistently as possible and so
we built some metrics around that and I
think one of them you guys are using is
based on a kind of a percentile thing
you know where that came from I was
doing database benchmarking for servers
and in service for databases you got to
get every query back quickly well it
turns out that like you can take some
cheap little Zeon's and you can get a
really good rate in a database benchmark
but there are some queries that will
take a long time to get back and so
you're saying the ATM machine it takes a
long time you're mad you get the big big
Zeon's with the cash and everything and
and okay it turns out that in that case
even if your rate is lower
you eliminate those long latency
transactions I started thinking about
that in the context of graphics it turns
out that what you want to do is deliver
every frame consistently just like you
want to do low latency transactions and
a database so we just brought over this
percentile thing and asked the question
it's kind of like the percentile is okay
99 percentile frame time is ninety-nine
percent of all frames came back in this
amount of time or less and you can kind
of summarize general performance by
picking a smart cutoff point and doing
you know measuring that and so you get a
summary of this entire distribution of
frame times of super complex and one
number that i think is superior to an
FPS average right so and that's what you
guys are doing and you've converted him
back the frame time back into FPS I
think in some of those guys right yeah
that's right and then just play it along
with the average and what you see is
that your your 99 percentile is always
lower than your average which tells you
that the average is not really
summarizing everything you you know it's
nice to kind of get toward where things
get hairy and get a sense of that right
right yeah that's one of the things
we've seen a very recent specific
instance was with the g3 to 58 and GTA 5
Shoji 3258 with some settings really
struggles with GTA 5 more than maybe a
77 60k or something like that and the
reason was because even though the
average was higher the one the lower
percent the 99 99.1 percentiles were or
point nine were so low that it was
effectively unplayable right and yeah
that's a small cache cpu with only two
threads two cords right and so you have
some constraints there and when when
hits when the rubber hits the road when
you have the hardest frames to generate
then that relatively weak hardware kind
of penalized you even though it has a
high rate because it's you know I pc is
okay and I'll get completed here but but
it's really not the only performance
property that you want is a high rate
you need to be tolerant of difficult
situations and if you can do that then
you deliver smooth perform
right so I think well we'll wrap up here
Scott it sounds like a lot of the work
you're planning to do at Andy is just
now beginning only been here a couple
months yeah so we certainly look forward
to it I've enjoyed reading tech report
you know all the years you worked on it
and hopefully you guys found this
