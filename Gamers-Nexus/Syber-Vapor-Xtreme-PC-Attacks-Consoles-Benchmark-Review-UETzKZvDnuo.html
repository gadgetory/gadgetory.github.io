access tonight and today we're reviewing
this this is a home theater PC that is
capable of playing basically every game
out on max settings and ultra settings
at 1080p resolutions in my benchmark in
which you will see later in this video
first note that this is part of a full
review a very detailed written review
links in the description below and this
is basically a the first in a wave of
home theater pcs that are meant to
replace consoles this is sort of in line
with the Alienware alpha ZOTAC CN 760
and gigabytes Brix Pro all these things
that were at one point billed as steam
machines but have sort of slowly become
mini pcs or home consoles as they're
called in this instance this is a much
higher end version of the models I just
listed this is called a cyber vapor
extreme and it is equipped with a gtx
980 and that is the highest performing
video card i've ever been charged for a
single GPU at 1080p gaming solutions
it's also got a 4790k in there pretty
powerful cpu definitely not even for
most games but in the very least it
pairs well with the GTX 980 which is not
always something you see in pre-built
pcs so cyber is a brand of cyber power
which is a system integrator or an SI
and they build computers they're sort of
like high power or digital storm or
Origen all those guys and this cyber
vapor extreme is one of three different
models of the cyber PC which is a PC
console they call it and the first one
this one uses the 980 the 4790k it's got
2 by 4 gigabytes of RAM so 8 gig of ram
using a data value memory in this
instance 1600 megahertz and it's got no
SSD a one terabyte 7200 rpm hard drive
and a small form-factor 450 watt which
is plenty for this 80 plus gold
Silverstone SFX power supply so that's
actually a very good power supply it's
really to be honest the part that I'm
most excited about being in the system
because the rest you kind of expect as
for the motherboard it's using a z97
I am ITX board that's equipped with AC
wireless and Bluetooth 4.0 so this is a
board that's available on the market as
are all these other parts you could
build this system yourself and if you're
curious what that would cost I priced it
out it would cost about $100 less to DIY
versus this and yes it's $100 less but
being honest with ourselves $100 is not
a lot of money to have someone build a
computer for you and then you get the
peace of mind that if something goes
wrong you can theoretically call
warranty department and get a
replacement theoretically that said
people turn for everyone our channel is
dedicated and advocates regularly the
idea of building your own system it's
it's pretty fun you learn a lot and you
get all the upgrade ability and things
like that sometimes pre-built are nice
especially in the instance where you're
gifting them to people or just don't
really have the time to build it
yourself which is definitely a thing
believe me so it's got its market and if
that market isn't you that's okay but in
terms of performance we benchmark this
it does very well in most games it plays
pretty much everything at Ultra or max
settings and for something that cost
fifteen hundred dollars it's about what
you'd expect the GTX 980 performs as it
always performs whether it's not it's in
one of these and the 4790k ensures that
there's basically no bottleneck on the
GPU when you're playing these more
modern games that are multi-threaded and
will take advantage of hyper threading
which is not a lot of them but
battlefield 4 is among the few that will
other than the internal specs this
system ships with a logitech f7 10
wireless controller which is actually a
pretty high-end controller it's it's
very satisfying to use it's similar to
the Xbox 360 wireless controller
definitely the best PC controller I've
ever used but this is a very close
competitor and it ships with the Box
another peripheral you get is this cyber
branded little remote control and this
is something you can buy separately on
Newegg but I wouldn't recommend it it's
sort of it's a nice gesture that they
have included it but to be honest it's
totally unusable because the buttons are
just way too small and it's sort of
infuriating to use I would recommend
buying something like a Logitech
k400 or they're better keyboard instead
which it's an extra $20 but it's a
full-sized keyboard so you can actually
type on it with like home row and stuff
unlike this where you're stuck using
fingers alternatively you could use a
mobile application plug into the
Bluetooth on the motherboard and use
your phone as a controller and that's
something that I really think is
potentially an oversight by cyber they
should have included some kind of
instructions on how to do something like
that or linked or plugged into an
existing application to use a phone as a
controller because this is ultimately
meant to replace things like DVRs and
consoles and in those instances you want
to make things as easy for the user as
possible to replace those items the
build quality internally it's built very
well this is a small form-factor case so
it's about 14 by 14 by 4 give or take
half an inch and that means there's very
limited space to manage the cables but
it's a modular PSU so there are no
unnecessary cables they don't ship the
extra cables with this box so if you
wanted to upgrade in the future and you
needed more power cables for pje you'd
have to buy this separately but that's
not a lot of money and not a big deal I
do wish that CyberPower built this with
an aftermarket cooler even if it drove
cost up an extra $30 because the stock
cooler in here for Intel's
4790k is just not enough it's not
cutting it it's fine if you're just
gaming and you're not beating the CPU up
to to directly with applications that
are more CPU intensive and games like
Photoshop encoding and things like that
and this machine is fully capable of
doing everything most users would want
in an application like Photoshop or
Premiere which is why it's a shame to
see it struggle from thermals when it's
really being stressed that can be
resolved with investing about 30 bucks
on your own and an aftermarket cooler
and really at that point you'd be buying
it if you built it yourself anyway so
it's not making a price difference on
either end of the the PC building versus
these system integrated options in
prime95 l fft benchmarking the 4790k was
hitting a hundred Celsius that's
t.j.maxx within 40 seconds of starting
the bench
so it's really not adequately cooled
fine for gaming still you're hitting 40
to 60 Celsius after subtracting ambient
and gaming applications so it's
definitely warm but it's not killing it
like like it would be in a more CPU
intensive task the GPA was running about
60 Celsius after subtracting ambient and
that's more reasonable that's that's
survival for the GTX 980 but still a bit
warm and the reason it's warm is because
this case does not have any case fans in
it it's just got this vent right here
this is exposing the CPU fan on one side
and on the on the opposite side it's
actually exposing the GPU fan so they've
used coming out of the PCIe slot on the
Mini ITX motherboard they've used a an
extension and mounted the video card
separately in the case which one allows
this small form-factor
and two it allows them to face the fan
at different direction so that they can
use intake from both sides of the box
and cool the GPU from one side the CPU
from outside and then the power supply
sucks air in from its fan as well so
there's only three fans in the system
and they're not case fans that means
that the system is fairly hungry for
cool air and you should upgrade the app
from the CPU cooler to be an aftermarket
cooler instead of this crappy Intel box
cooler that's in here but that's more
I'm really Intel than anyone although of
course case fans would help tremendously
but they just won't fit in this box
system integrators get sort of a bad rap
in the PC building sector because they
are regularly at odds with what PC
builders individually would select for
components in the instance of the
extreme version of the cyber box I agree
with pretty much all of the component
selection other than what I just listed
I do wish that the RAM had actual heat
sinks on it instead of value memory and
the only reason I say that is because
it's so hot anyway that the RAM would
actually benefit from heat sinks
assuming it had a way to wick the the
heat away from the sinks but this it
does make sense the components in here
it's $1,500 if you build it yourself I
was running about $1400 including the
operating system and the controller
because this includes both of those I
did not include this keypad thing I
don't know what
cost but you shouldn't buy it and it's
not a bad price I don't feel the same
way about cybers other option the cyber
vapor eye and the cyber vapor a and
those basically the cyber vapor I use an
i3 CPU I'm not sure which one but it's
an i3 and it uses a gtx 750ti and it
costs $700 at $700
the DIY approach you can easily get an
i-5 or even honestly an 860 K might make
more sense for multi-threaded
applications at this point and you'd
probably want to get a different GPU
that 760 is kind of on sale sometimes
but in r9 270 if you're not afraid of
AMD which it's okay if you are that
would be available as well at a
reasonable price so you can build a
better system at 700 or even 600 than
the one that cyber is offering I really
don't agree with their CPU and the GPU
combination the cyber vapor a the IMA
our intel and AMD and my understanding
that a ships within x4 8 40 and the
Athlon cpu and it's using an a 78
chipset so it's a bit limited on
overclocking things like that and it's
got an r9 270 video card and that one
costs $100 less it's $600 I don't think
those two systems are as great value as
this one this is pretty damn good value
and it's hard to beat that
in terms of performance this runs as you
can see in the bench it runs over 100
FPS and some games like grid it runs
basically in line with what we expect
from a GTX 980 you know surprise there
and it's it's easily pushing 50 FPS even
in Assassin's Creed unity and Far Cry 4
which are two of the most intensive
titles I've tested lately because they
are poorly optimized and the fact that
it runs those well means that it will
run pretty much everything pretty well
at 1080p at 1440p you'll still be ok you
will not be gaming at 4k on this machine
for most modern games some games smaller
indie titles or less intensive or very
well optimized titles you
push for K or DSR but most people are on
1080 anyway and 1440 so in those
instances this is capable plane
everything I've tested that maximum or
near maximum settings depending on your
AAA and AF settings so it's very high
performing cost $1500 it's 100 dollars
more than if you built it yourself
really not bad value if we're honest
with ourselves it's in a small
form-factor case a pretty tiny case and
you could build something similar to
this with like an as a Z mini z case but
this is this is a fairly custom one it's
about the size of an Xbox it's 14 by 14
by 4 so pretty small and being that it
is a proper PC it's fully upgradable as
one would expect from a full PC as
opposed to a console as for whether you
should buy this machine it really
depends on if you want a home theater
console in your living room because
that's what this is built to do if
you're buying something for an office or
another room then you really could
probably build a bigger system as I'm
physically larger and it'll run a bit
cheaper because that's just how many ITX
works and definitely run cooler in the
very least if not cheaper if you want
something you can hide away in a corner
or under a TV behind a TV this is
something that should be on your short
list you should look at other items like
the en 760 from ZOTAC the Alienware
alpha the gigabyte bricks and things
along those lines because those are
going to be the closest low-end
competitors to the vapor a and I and and
then of course there are some
competitors in the higher end as well
which is what this would be all in all
it performs very well this the build
quality is good I wish they chose a
better CPU cooler that is quieter and
cools better the RAM should probably
have heat sinks it's sorely lacking an
SSD which i think is strange because SSD
is severely impact boot up time and that
is a big deal in a home theater
environment where you want to boot
quickly so you can watch or play games
on demand and it's it's just one less
reason for you to walk away and go to
your main desktop as someone who uses a
home theater PC so those are weird
things you can upgrade all three of
those items at that point you need to
sort of look at the prices in question
what's worth it the performance is
pretty amazing it's built well the
components make sense the price is good
value so all those things considered
this is something I could get behind but
not necessarily something I would buy
for myself that makes sense if you are
into buying a pre-built machine and
don't want to build it yourself and you
have a $1,500 budget I would send you
this way because it is the best value
small form-factor pre-built machine I
have found on the market if you know of
other ones please link them below if you
want to build it yourself we have guides
for that and you're always welcome to
come to our forums for support so please
