have an absolute bargain octopus oh
she's like Great Scott am I going
fucking we have this game if you want to
make up for Bioshock game skyline's you
feel like part of the city so we do we
talk about this when we start
automatically if you have a city when
you're basically floating island how
people get around it how they sprayed
around and how they transfer things
around it I think you know phone will
find our aims that one you know we go
rapture as ridiculous as it is you know
Big Daddy's an old sisters walking
around with a splice which I don't wanna
be like a place that was believable in
its own confidence and the rules that we
have and so we start talking about why
we don't want to be silent if I say I my
school how they work in the city so you
start doing it's like whoa the imply
bring track the car transport you know
Carlo private listings I'm starting
putting lawns or you can see these these
cargo containers
for them why don't we alike there's
places that people are actually using
the signal in the city because there's
sometimes no other way to get around in
the city that's structured like this and
so it's really important to us i did not
feel like a rational clang clang which
is you know any service perfect like
that you see some acts very cool from
the gameplay per second means specially
the possibilities of fighting on those
things jumping off and shooting things
but we then have to make sure it heals
part of columbia i needa great he's so
sorry why are they there they're not
disease designer drawing lines if that
either be their participation or
therefore you know the harbor lincoln
says do we have a video of the straight
line i use we have that I think that
look this is a good evolution of shows
but Justin comes to us with that now and
it's pure design is cure jumping around
and advocating then he comes to the our
team and we have to think about like
well how do we make this fun and how do
we need with this world and believe me
and believe you only how do you make me
feel like when you're honest and
dangerous you're holding on by to see
you and so this this screen is coming up
purses ended showing that
shopping earlier this week so anyways I
think about it so much about it's like
it's the same thing like it too static
and a sound effect of what we were
telling this is like being on a roller
coaster playing or hanging there you've
got a fucking gun</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
