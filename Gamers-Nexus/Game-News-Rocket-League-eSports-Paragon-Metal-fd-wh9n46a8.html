and a metal band but we begin with Epic
Games epics most recent announcement
concerns their upcoming title Paragon
and like most MOBAs Paragon has put the
heroes in the forefront of the game's
image but has done so to the extent that
even the earliest released content from
the game was just simple animations of a
few characters the latest from epic is
that all of Paragons heroes will be
available to anyone with the game
meaning that you won't have to pay to
play with the hero that you like and
while there will still be
microtransactions in the game it is the
modern era after all they will be purely
for cosmetic items we've all heard that
a thousand times now so we'll be
interesting to see how epic one defines
cosmetic items and to how they handle
that approach and try and make it a
commercially viable solution while
sustaining a good game speaking of
commercializing entry to early access
for Paragon is at least twenty dollars
and this puts Paragon on a similar path
to dota 2 which is really not a bad path
to follow dota 2 has had the pay-to-play
beta periods before and that was before
it became free to play which it is now
and as Paragon is planning to do all of
dota 2 heroes have been available to
everyone another interesting point in
the parallels while epic has not
announced any plans for Paragon eSports
events specifically twitch TV and
psionics have esports news of their own
this week and that pertains to rocket
League the rocket league developers and
Amazon owned live streaming gurus have
teamed up to form the rocket league
championship series beginning March 25th
teams of three will be able to register
to participate and the first season will
have a prize pool of 75,000 dollars with
55 grand alone going to first place the
initial qualifiers are open to anyone
but only the pc and ps4 versions of the
game are immediately supported this will
be the biggest prize pool to date that
rocket League has put forward from
rocket cars to rocket ships we now move
to no man's sky hello games a space
exploration project ambitiously promises
to give players 18 quintillion planets
to explore that's 18 with 18 0
after it by the way this week pre-orders
for no man's sky have finally started
its price is sixty dollars right now and
that's the same as generally any triple
a title except this one is still
considered an indie game that begs the
question of course how much game is
there in 18 quintillion planets we know
they're supposed to be at least
partially if not largely or entirely
procedurally generated and I'm kind of
curious where that 18 can tell you a
number comes from maybe a floating point
limit or something like that but the
scope of another on the way space game
star citizen is bigger broader and then
again so is its production funding
development and perpetually moving
module release dates regardless there
are lots of promising space Sims and
space games on the horizon with updates
still coming to existing titles like
elite dangerous and it's a good time to
be a space sim fan no man's sky is
definitely worth keeping on the radar of
course stay tuned to our own coverage as
we look into the game and post our own
reviews and things of that nature the
final news item for this week features
seminal prog rockers a dream theater
don't worry this is still video game
news to follow up the release of their
13th album the band has announced a
collaboration with developers turbo tape
games their album the astonishing is set
in a dystopian version of the United
States and follows a group of rebels
against the great northern empire of the
Americas that's some 1984 stuff right
there the game will follow the same
conflict and takes the form of a board
game style strategy game there are a few
details out other than these but we do
know that it will launch in the second
quarter of 2016 somewhat related Iron
Maiden's also got its own mobile game
coming out under the guidance of
founding member Steve Harris starring
band icon Eddie the zombie that's all
