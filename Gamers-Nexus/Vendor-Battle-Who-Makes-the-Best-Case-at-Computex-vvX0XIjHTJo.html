we're doing another vendor battle video
that we did at PAX East I think there's
a lot of shows so what we're doing here
George everyone has one minute and you
have to defend has to get ready you have
to defend why someone should buy your
case why is your case the best in the
industry if they're a new system builder
so before getting to that all this
coverage is brought to you by msi and
the new x99 motherboards for broad well
II so with that one minute George may
Chris from corsair George I'm building a
new pc why should i buy your case from
the beginning every one of our cases has
been designed for building a case easily
so it's easy to build it's really easy
to assemble a lot of tool free features
things like that also we got into cases
a little bit late compared to a lot of
our competitors so we didn't start until
about two thousand nine which means that
we started at the same time we started
liquid cooling so every single case
we've ever shipped has liquid cooling
compatibility in it we were also some of
the guys refers to innovative features
like having a steel front panel on a
case of the c70 having built on carry
handles having full side panel windows
like on the 400 °c or 600 °c or 760 t
we have a lot of cool innovations and
features and things like that and we
have a great alignment of cases from
fifty to three hundred and fifty dollars
depending on what kind of features
materials and designs you want from
obsidian aluminum stuff down to kind of
the standard plastic gamers stuff like
spec alpha and spectra one very cool so
that is Corsairs bit on why you should
buy theirs keep watching we'll move on
to the next vendor oh I forgot one one
more thing I am incredibly handsome
that's a really good reason not like
these other guys who are this video wow
it's true so now we're at the
thermaltake booth at combi text 2016 i'm
joined by shannon rob wrapping
thermaltake here shannon same question
to you as everyone else i'm building a
new system why should i buy your case
and not someone elses try and wrap it
for me in about 60 seconds well as you
can see behind you we work a lot with
modders we work a lot with enthusiasts
we not only take unique designs good
quality we try to learn from everyone in
the community we try to take all your
feedback if you buy a case and you go to
me and say hey you know what irie don't
like this or I think you should have
this those are serious considerations we
give from
to our case designers and say no hey is
this something we can realistically make
and we try to make it even better not to
mention we started life as a thermal
company so part of our core competence
is keeping things cool so we design our
child sees around the whole idea of
massive air flow liquid cooling fitment
and overall options to the user and we
take our halo products throw as many
options as we can into them as many as
we can make it to make an awesome case
then we take the cases below it and we
tear it down and we try to trickle we
try the trickle-down effect and fit as
many of those features as possible into
them we try to take everything from the
ground up to build it to be just the
best case possible very cool so that's
what thermaltake Scott you know George
had something to say about you guys he
said he is the most handsome
manufacturer out of all the ones here
the first was handsome representative
you got anything to say about that well
I just got to say George you're wrong I
mean when you're talking about this this
hair this hair it's like a match made in
heaven baby so states here we'll check
out be quiet next hey everyone now we're
at the be quiet booth i'm joined by
christophe cats are from be quiet and
chris all the same question to you as
everyone else I'm building a new system
why should i buy your cases and not one
of the other guys i think is very simple
you know be quiet is all about the
quality and the biggest factor would be
quite as the silence as the name already
said so when you build silent components
you need to really will take care about
the good quality of the components it
some themselves so with our cases I
think we do this really well with like
really good quality of materials with
the manufacturing process and you know
the biggest factor is the silence part
so we want to have your system really
silent so how we are going to accomplish
that we have dampening materials we have
like certain air flows in the system
that the noise cannot go out of the
system and so on so I think in that part
the biggest factor of our cases is the
silence factor as is with our other
products so I am if you are going for a
silent build because you just don't want
to hear your case all night you know
then that is definitely the best way
quality and
Islands there will be it yep so that's
two be quiet mantra quality and silence
so that's all for our computex vendor
battle tune in next show when we put
more vendors head-to-head with trust me
you're seeing the video you can tell
George has turned into a YouTube
commenter yeah yeah exactly look at the
youtube comments people that's I love
you people youtube comments best you to
come don't we love our YouTube
