accessed on that and we're here at GDC
2016 now we're talking about CryEngine
specifically the new CryEngine 5
cleverly named CryEngine vr which was
just announced today before we get to
that all this coverage is brought to you
by raw Furies new goner game which is an
indie platformer and you can see that
plane on the screen now CryEngine 5 it
does something similar to what they did
last year but almost a bit more extreme
so here are the last two years now unity
Epic Games Unreal Engine and Crytek's
CryEngine have been going back and forth
in this pricing battle and epics Unreal
Engine is now free unity is pretty
accessible to mostly everyone at this
point and as big an indie development
and cry engine was ten dollars a month
epics Unreal Engine used to be twenty
dollars a month but now CryEngine is
using a pay-what-you-want model so that
is brand new for them you can pay as
little as you want and if you're
wondering how they make money that's
something we ask them immediately and it
sounds like the current plan is sort of
a mix between the previous licensing
fees for big companies and the
accessibility for smaller debs so now
the way it works is if you want to go
download CryEngine you can do that you
can pay what you want again effectively
zero dollars if you want it to and then
they're monetizing through a marketplace
which has assets created by curated
users and that's on a rev share platform
and they also monetize through
connections with developers that like
star citizen's cloud imperium games so
for larger developers like that the
provision that Crytek creates is access
to engineering so low level engineering
support and developers who can provide
tech support for perhaps conversion to
64-bit and star citizen specific case
now on the technical side the part
that's interesting to us as a gamer is
not as developers of course because I'm
certainly not I know a lot of you aren't
as a gamer is the interesting aspect
here is the new CryEngine 5 build has
low level Direct X 12 support it's fully
optimized and integrated so that will of
course move games forward into the DX 12
momentum that we've got going right now
and it's also got a new particle effect
system which you'll see coming out in
games that are in development
today but they might be coming out a
year or more from now and on top of the
particle effects system there's
additional visual effects promising all
move to the GPU for the most part that
of course hugely improves framerate so
the can it run crysis question mostly
goes away as the GPU takes over all this
intensive processing visual FX and then
finally there's a new cloud system so
there's an advanced cloud system that
makes clouds look a lot more dynamic and
real rather than just sort of big
two-dimensional textures floating in the
sky so that's the update for CryEngine
with CryEngine 5 and if you're
interested as developed right you could
certainly download it if you want to
play around with it but as gamers that's
what we have to look forward to so links
