hardware news recap for the last week
we'll be talking about a couple of items
including and the partner cards and the
BIOS revisions and the driver revisions
and then we'll also be going through
some of the Intel security features and
updates then we've got news on this EVGA
motherboard the ex 299 dark which I
think we saw at Computex is finally
coming out so it's been a while but
we've got some notes on this one we'll
be testing it shortly before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly makers of the conductor hot
liquid metal that we recently used to
drop 20 degrees off of our coffee leak
temperatures thermal grizzly also makes
traditional thermal compounds we use on
top of the IHS like cryo not and
hydronaut pastes learn more at the link
below so starting out with more of an
ad-lib thing just about testing I've
done the last few days we've been
working on the easiest tricks and the
power color rx Vegas 64 cards finally
and we're getting places a couple notes
here driver version 17 dot 11.3 is
bugged and he knows about the issue and
I think by the time this video goes live
they will have released 17 dot 11.4
which fixes most of the issues that
we've encountered so on 17 11 3 the
clocks don't seem like they two things
they don't seem like they work properly
they don't seem like they report
properly so testing on 17 11 3 both
partner cards were working on perform
the same as the reference cards and also
don't report the clocks correctly at all
so that's one problem rolling back to 17
10.1 fixed some of the performance
issues but then it's an older driver
version so you get into territory where
it's like it's not really representative
test anymore because when people buy the
card they're not going to use a weeks
old version so yeah 17 11.4 should fix
it we will be testing as soon as we have
that should be sometime today as of
filming and that should pretty much fix
all the problems so three views are
coming we're just we've been waiting we
were waiting on v bios from the partners
then we were waiting on
clearance from them to review and then
we were waiting on drivers to work with
the partner cards so it's been a long
story
but hopefully we'll have actual reviews
for you soon I know that some outlets
have post some already
17:11 for I think was shared a little
ahead of time with some people but we're
waiting for the final official release
version to consumers because too much
has changed lately
it makes no sense to publish a review
with data that could potentially at this
point be invalid when we've already
waited like two months to post one so
that's what we're doing we're waiting we
have the Red Devil and we have the asus
strix both of which have tear downs on
the channel already thermals have
already been done for a while now on
both cards that all works just fine the
problem is when you start getting into
gaming you either sacrifice the clocks
or you sacrifice the performance
optimizations done for the games with 17
out 10.1 you lose some of those 17 11.3
you lose the clock reporting but thermal
testing is just fine so that's good real
topic here at gigabyte has an RX Vega 64
gaming OC windforce 2x I think is the
name of the card this is their wind
force dual fan cooler applied to Vega
including Vega 56 and thus far we've
only worked with and seen Vega 64
partner cards so gigabytes venture with
Vega 56 stands as far more interesting
seeing as it's the better buy of the two
arcs Vega units the wind force card
claims to be using a custom PCB with a
12 plus one phase of erm but if you look
at it it looks like it's basically
reference just taller and we can
actually probably show some of our power
color footage where it's the same thing
there either way though the reference
PCB and vrm are crazy over built so
that's not a bad thing gigabyte has a
copper plate at the back of the GPU
which we previously found did nothing
for thermals when we stuck probes all
over the extreme 1080 Ti version with a
bigger plate that said this time they've
also got a copper heat pipe running
through the backplate so it's more
likely to impact temperature now but
remember it's not going to change the
core temperature that much so if you're
trying to measure a core temperature
differences
you're not really gonna find them they
will not be within there'll be a
basically outside of test resolution for
the most part so what you're more likely
to see we think sort of hypothesizing is
a difference in the vrm temperatures
because if you look at the heat pipe it
follows the vrm component placement on
the opposite side there's a chance that
it might actually work this time and do
something other than that it's an
aluminum and copper heat sink with two
100 millimeter fans the clocks are
targeted at 15 60 megahertz boost so not
much of an OC but there's potential that
the board power allowance is higher than
reference we'll just have to see the
next one XFX also has their 56 and 64
double edition cards coming out photos
of these have surfaced before but XFX
has now more formally shown it's double
edition cards and it's well it's
something it's a it's something that
resembles a fish and it has carbon fiber
finish on it but truth be told you're
not sure what XFX is doing with the
design the comedy is using a short PCB
so it's smaller that you could make a
Vega mini with it but they've stuck a
giant cooler on it so you lose that
option but yeah at least the back plate
logo will be right side up when you
install the card though that's good but
well we'll see see if anything comes
with that one MSI so MSI has followed
gigabyte here with a BIOS update for
some of their all-in-one computers and
motherboards this doesn't apply to every
motherboard just yet but keep checking
basically this is for the intel TX II
security issue where there was a concern
of security exploits and vulnerabilities
on Intel platforms dating back to I
believe skylake that we know of and this
is from the men X OS so MINIX is an OS
that was built by an educator Andrew
Tannenbaum and that was used by Intel
legally under the license it was
released under to create basically a
low-level OS on a negative rein on the
CPU that you have no access to to catch
everyone up so now Intel has released
the tool which will link below that
allows you to tell if you are affected
and if you need to be concerned about
this
and if you are then the next step is go
to the motherboard manufacturers
download a BIOS update and install it
MSI is starting to release there as
gigabyte has one out and I believe
asrock might also have one out already
at this point next news item ek water
blocks so ek recently received an award
from us for the best noise levels or
best silence with their ek predator XL c
that we tested late last year early this
year and that cooler unfortunately as
great as it was in other ways was
discontinued for catastrophic failures
70% of the user reviews on Newegg are
one star basically hopefully the new
version is better the Phoenix takes the
same or similar QDC valves which we
actually like those valves a lot the
quick disconnect and it takes the same
semi-custom loop layout where you
disconnect the valves you can connect a
video card block or a CB radiator it's a
semi modular design cost isn't great
they did reduce the cost immediately
though after a launch but prices for the
units are 190 euros for the 280 rad core
60 to 70 for the CPU blocks 125 to 135
for the GPU blocks it's getting towards
a real open-loop but the idea I guess is
that it's easier to implement for
someone who doesn't want to do that but
still has the the funds to get one so
that's the Fenix it will be they've also
got 360s I think and it looks like they
come with the Vardar fans if you buy
that combo pack next news item EVGA SX
299 dark board is finally in that's what
this one right here so this we just got
in today and it's a board that we saw at
Computex so the reason it's interesting
and we're doing thermal tests on this we
already did them on the asus board it's
interesting because not only does it
have a real heat sink that's finned like
a heat sink should be all the way across
pretty good fin density - they also went
and put little crowns or dunce caps or
whatever on top with these tiny fans
like
like 30 millimeter 40 millimeter fan
something like it maybe smaller I was
measure it for the review but two tiny
fans on there they blow straight down
obviously it's pretty cool excellently
we'll have to test and see how the noise
is if they're whiny and a couple other
things too like if they're even
necessary because a heat sink that's
pinned properly like this should do a
lot of the job for you already
it also has a sort of I mean this is
just a retention plate for the vrm
heatsink but it's finned as well it will
dissipate a bit of heat though with they
don't pad that thick not a whole lot
will get there
and otherwise heat pipes in there
there's another heat sink under the IO
shield there's built-in IO cover
it's got exposed gold on the edges which
will help expose the ground layer and
it's built for overclocking so for
people who are asking why does only have
four dims it's because it makes things a
lot easier for overclocking and it
shortens the trace length from the dim
slot to the CPU so if you're doing
memory overclocking you should
theoretically all other things equal be
able to achieve a higher memory clock on
something that has DIMM slots closer to
the CPU than one that does not so that's
the theory behind it other than that
it's also got a fan of the chipset which
I think might blow air into the SSD I'm
not too cooler that's what we were told
at Computex I have to take it apart and
see if they ended up doing that or not
but that's the that's the board it
actually looks pretty interesting I'm
excited to look at it it's it's
unfortunate that X 299 has had slowed
option because this board is actually
pretty cool but you know X 399 is giving
it a hell of a hard time to compete so
that's pretty serious competition from
AMD silverstone has a PM 0 - this is a
quick news item we'll just put some
pictures up
we like the primary 0 1 the primary 0 -
looks like it gets rid of the best
feature of it which is the heavily
ventilated pure metal mesh front that
breathes excellently they've replaced it
with a semi mesh semi artistic design
for the front not going to be nearly as
well
better than cases with a flat metal
front Silverstone tena talking with them
it almost sounds like they're a little
discouraged I guess by the market not
adopting the cases with actually good
airflow which I can I can hear that but
so they're trying something out by
deviating a bit from their more function
focused approach and going for some form
to try and capture market share but let
them know in the comments below if you
actually like that move or not finally
there's a couple sales we're gonna be
including sales at the ends of of these
videos through the holidays at least and
will include links below to the products
that we're talking about each time
so Andy rising CP is once again are
marked down more than they were
previously in the US on Amazon at time
of filming we saw them for 171 dollars
for an r5 1600 which won our best value
award for good reason at 190 now is 20
dollars cheaper so we can strongly
recommend that if you need a cpu the r7
seventeen hundred's down to 240 ish
which is also pretty crazy good 10 bucks
gets you 1700 X not worth it just get
the 1700 and overclocked it and then the
1080i Duke which we put on our best
value for a 1080i as far as 1080 eyes go
is down to 710 with a rebate right now
and the fractal meza Phi which we gave
the best overall award for a case is
currently $70 so we picked some of the
items here that actually received
different words and accolades from us
and we'll link them below because
they're on sale and they're good deals
that's all for this one thank you for

this is the GN Graff logo which is I
think on sale at least most the other
shirts are and sort of the stickers so
thank you for watching I'll see you all
