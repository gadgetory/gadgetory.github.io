director of gaslamp games I'm David palm
guard I'm the art director and gasps I'm
games and here to show you a little bit
about clockwork empires which is our
upcoming sandbar steampunk colony
builder with occult influences and this
is a hotel room we're doing it in so
without further ado David is going to
play and we're just going to talk about
what's basically happening all right the
player is settling the frontier for a
sort of a weird world steampunk version
of the British Empire at the height of
its Imperial hubris and power so you're
sent out into the wilderness to extract
resources and spread civilization and
new cover the land and progress that
kind of a thing chopped down all the
trees Sarah pollute the rivers of our
beloved scarlet effluvia so we're jump
we jumped right in and we're thrown into
the darkness of the unknown we have a 20
starting colonists a whole whisky and
handguns whisky and handguns all the
tools and bricks and planks modules you
need you to survive and start a colony
if we unpause the characters will sort
of wander around and just chat to one
another drink whisky as they're inclined
all of our characters have memories they
all have personally traits they remember
the conversations they had to people
about various topics how they feel about
each other based on those conversations
and reactions and as they go they will
form relationships remember who they
like and who they don't and turn into
friends and get married or we have
bitter rivals and enemies and kill each
other if we just leave them to their own
devices they'll still wander around
they'll chat but eventually it'll get
hungry and they'll eat all the food that
we have with we brought with us and then
at some point someone's going to die of
starvation and then they'll eat a I'm
really hungry chopped up their body and
eat them so yes we do have cannibalism
so now that we've covered the important
stuff let's tell you a little bit about
we don't want cannibalism in our colony
so let's go click OK you don't actually
mind control characters it's not like
you know don't worry about your APM you
uh you're sort of the invisible hand of
the bureaucracy what you do is you
create tasks and jobs and then a work
crew what will claim that and just
carried out for you as they're able so
I'm going to go collect some of this
weird black fungus on the ground
go there so now we have something to eat
and there lots of trees around so might
as well chop that it's down because you
have to collect logs and planes and
stuff but you know build progress
absolutely progress so because we're
trying to get away from micromanagement
we use the Empire class system to our
advantage you have upper class middle
class and lower class characters and
typically what happens is you have a
middle class work party which is managed
by one middle class overseer or
artisinal worker and they have a bunch
of lower-class laborers of various sorts
working for them so here we have an
overseer directing tree chopping also
i'm feeling very hungry and somewhere
else another overseers off directing
funnel picking operations we have these
lovely baskets of black fungus that they
will eat I guess because that's
delicious looking they're hungry they're
hungry a honey you should build a farm
maybe similar it's important that we
don't have to eat too much strange
mushrooms and found in the woods so
let's grow up here instead maybe not
opium I don't think come on do do do
some grubby opium Brody opium and maybe
some cabbage so you just young yes like
a farm click and drag you know I'm a
building grid really straightforward so
here we'll grow some opium Nicholas
thank you and another one I'll treat
cabbage this cabbage is great I don't
care of you think k you smoke it alright
so we should probably also get some
shelter up because it's absolutely
nowhere to sleep so you know I just
pulled the Billy menu and how about a
lower class house so it's a somewhat
miserable bunkhouse but you know it'll
do this is the frontier charming
accommodations so again you just the
Polka building grid dragged out to your
designate where the building codes we
have nice blueprints yeah you can
specify the shape of your building
unlike other other games you can specify
how many doors you want on it where you
would like the doors the modules yeah
all of the objects in a building are we
call the modules to just like doors cots
work benches lamps fabulous paintings
Adelaide paintings I'm gonna put a
lovely painting yeah somebody's uncle
something and having some cots so they
could sleep with them I did get them
though okay let's put a cheaper painting
next to its that have you know contrast
there we go so like the other jobs this
will be taken on by a work crew beds are
available you don't have to micromanage
all that they'll pick up building
materials look some at the site to build
a building for you the way you laid it
out and then they will start installing
the labs of things so let's get a
carpentry workshop going oh yeah it was
about carpentry and here we have our
farmers furiously farming cabbage and
opium oh the opium and perfect
combination all right so I'll need a cup
sure workshop so i can start processing
these trees that are chopping down the
loading bay brother so loading bay doors
help you get people into the building
and faster and supplies in and out
faster you know put on a workbench they
can work and a standing desk so that the
overseer can do paperwork it's very
important to do paperwork your oxy is
very important in the Empire all hail
the bureaucracy invisible hand that
keeps us going in our darkest hours
through their hearts and lose our to a
pen and ink all right so we have not
written any fish people yet I could sing
a song about the bureaucracy while we
wait for fish people we don't have to
wait ok let's + ok so I say we didn't
farm cabbage and only OPM and people got
terribly upset and hungry they'll start
you know becoming upset and straying
from the path of the Empire they'll
start getting dark thoughts and
eventually but he's trying to say is
cults let's talk about cults I'll start
forming cult I mean in other way this
may happen is you know we could send an
explorer out perhaps he find an artifact
out in the woods your office in cinemas
throw out the artifact in the woods find
the artifact like the job system I just
say you know it's floor over here and
then the free naturalist will go out
there explore poke around and things are
not meant to poke around it you can see
we've built the lower-class bunkhouse
and people are installing costs and
things figured a great number bring it
to the construction site and then hammer
window there we go wonderful okay
there's our Explorer and there's some of
those W of those trying to start a cult
others there we are and no not having it
we are we are not happy about cults if
you look at her personnel
he trades we may find out why that is
okay cuz everyone has a randomly
generated personality traits for example
she has pictures patriotic which means
that you know culture a culture not
patriotic and be the sort of thing you
do stiff upper lip but all that she is
strange she is strange they would like
cults later on if she was more upset but
she's also xenophobic so she doesn't
like outsiders or anything really yes
albertine patch what a great name
alright has especially crying into some
mushrooms right so no fish people are
forthcoming but say you know you went to
the beach you start over fishing or
ruining the excellent sand if this is a
fish inhabited by fish people is a biome
inhabited by fish people if there are
fish people fishing going about their
daily lives they will not like this you
know your construction projects going on
there so say say we pissed them off
somehow we're growing cabbage by the
beach fake cabbage I will use my magic
developer tool to spawn fish people
pissed them off is not vocabulary
approved by the Empire and ha fish
people ah in the cabbage we're in the
Quran everyone's leaving good running
off again they're all somebody's got
into the house they're busy killing oh
that's just bad oh no no no no as fine
Irish by a fish fight so fistfight with
this people oh and they're having
terrified parts because uh they'll
actually create memories of this yes
people will remember being harassed by
fish people and the gaucho by their
slimy hands and they'll be driven to
drink and and morbid thoughts fish
people will attempt to kidnap your
characters and take them back to the sea
to change them into fish people so you
may find you know your colonists were
dragged off and then returned they may
have you know a couple of fin sticking
out of their kind of thing little green
around that look about charming you
gills you know oh there's attacking our
buried collectors no and that's terrible
yes everything is people again they'll
treat memories about this and if their
memories are sad or it affects their
overall mood and may dropping the train
then our military is automatically
responded that they go the grabbing were
guns so
one fish person dead though they're
dancing because they've noticed the
other fish people clear her better yet
it's probably terrible oh just what we
get from making opium first but but we
sort of reveled in the things going
wrong like their consequences so for
example this guy has just cut up the
fish person's body to make enormous fish
steaks so it gets hungry and it doesn't
like cabbage well he eat the fish fig
more migrants so now they arrive because
they're apparently enthusiastic it is
still better the life at home or
actually maybe they're criminals the the
Empire Wilson do a lot of criminals how
are we doing everybody is dying and
their dead bodies everywhere there's a
dead body in the pond over this place
and a collection of Oh mmm yeah that is
a dead body in the bunkhouse and people
are now going out of the bunkhouse and
in tonight with access I'm not too sure
what's going on here at this point one
of the nice things about emergent
behavior is you don't know what will
emerge and we are still young people
turn the harvest cabbage and opium I
know it's in the opium crying and there
we go I think our mother just died there
we are so in conclusion we now have
opium we have a poet everybody is dying
clockwork empires where things going
terribly wrong is terribly amusing our
website is triple w gaslamp gamescom
clockwork empires com or clockwork
empires calm we have a weekly mailing
