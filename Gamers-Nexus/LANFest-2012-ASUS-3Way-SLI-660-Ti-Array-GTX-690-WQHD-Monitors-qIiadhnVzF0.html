they're the ones who run the republic of
gamers and i'm here with the console of
the Republic patty patty from Asus she's
going to talk it talk to us about some
of the stuff that they're showing off
here including a rad display to read
displays actually and this build right
here all right how do you go ahead and
take us through this right here we have
this Cosmo is a refuge for extremes are
running at 79 20 lemons socket okay as
well as 3-way SLI geforce gtx 660ti
along with our rog xonar phoebus sound
card so this is isolated almost the
ultimate gaming system that you can go
and just really flushed out and then we
have this paired up with three VG 27 8h
monitors so these are three and media
team vision capable monitor what we are
slightly different from our usual set up
versus reading 3s around as we actually
have two monitors are clones running
create on doing Street Fighter as well
as the center console we got to monitor
what's going on you that's pretty mean
so like what are some of the tweaks that
you can make with this interface here
well we kind of just wanted to do that's
to let people kind of shy out through
hands-on just taking a step away from
sure around all the time on so the
different tweets you can do with ticking
troopers are over cotton monitor your
exact chart as well as on you know the
edge also the monitor the different
fantasies as well as we were you slob
speed so it kind of gives you a good
overview about what people will work is
to software as well as you know what is
it powers
emphasis as you do 3d surround but we
wanted to do something different for
that shower we're going to bring a
little bit of a bowl game awesome do you
want tickets over by the surround yeah
what's up check it out over here so on
this one these are actually our new PB
27 8q monitors on these are our WK w
cute HD monitors so they're running each
of the monitor are 256 5 1443 money oh
my gosh yeah so it's crazy insane and
I'm gonna have all these three monitor
biting off the Roll nine boxes like
probably like the most powerful system
you can build in such as long yeah this
line box we have p8z77-i deluxe mother
works without the c77 I do bridge
motherboard as well as gtx 690 so it's a
really powerful system have to dry three
hi res super high-res a monitor and just
you know how about India's game this we
have running Borderlands here so you can
really also see all the pieces
definitely a high demand very physics
rich game right there you see how just
smooth frame rate is yeah looks looks
pretty awesome I really need to get one
