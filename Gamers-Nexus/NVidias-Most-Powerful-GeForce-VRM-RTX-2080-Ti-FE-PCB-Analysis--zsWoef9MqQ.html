going to be taking a look at the RT X xx
atti founders edition PCB from Nvidia
and we're just gonna dive right into it
because there's no point in talking
about sort of stuff ahead of time that
I'm gonna address anyway so then let's
start off with the V RMS starting with
the largest and most important one first
the V Corps vrm which is actually split
into two separate parts before that this
video is brought to you by thermaltake
and the view 71 enclosure the view 71 is
a full tower case that's capable of
fitting three video cards and most
configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench lineup the view 71 has
hinged a tempered glass doors on either
side that make it easy to open and show
off and it comes with at least one rain
fan though you can get the RGB version
if you prefer learn more at the link in
the description below so you have one
half well it's not really a half because
they're not the same size but you have
sort of one group of v core phases over
there and you have the other group of
ecore phases over here above that above
the larger v course the core vrm you
have the memory VR m so v mm or v GD DDR
or whatever you want to call it that
powers the GDD r6 memory chips scatter
around the die up here you have what is
probably the 1.8 volts rail this rail is
necessary for the GDD r6 memory chips as
well as Nvidia's BIOS chips they they
run off of 1.8 volts as well down here I
assume this is for USB C power because
there is a USB type-c port in the i/o
section of the GPU over in this area
there should be a PEX rail though the
pecs rail might also be here I'm not
sure it's it's hard to say without the
card in hand so the pecs rail is going
to be located in this area and there's
also going to be a 5 volts v RM in that
area as well and the 5 volts is for
powering the actual power stages because
those will not run off of 12 volts or
3.3 volts
and the PCIe slot only provides 12 and
3.3 volts to the GPU so it's necessary
for the GPU to generate its own 5 volts
rail and that's gonna be happening
somewhere over there again I have a
pictures of the card not the actual card
in hand so hard to say which regulator
exactly is doing that now then let's get
into the details on the V curve erm
starting with the funky layout well it's
not really that funky but it is a bit
special we've you know there's the Titan
v has a similar layout but most cards
generally you just have one strip of
phases and they don't do this kind of to
separate lines layout and there's
actually kind of two major benefits to
doing this layout so first of all it
spreads the thermal thermal load of the
vrm across a much larger area so instead
of having you know all 13 phases crammed
into one line or into let's say a
rectangle of that size on this side of
the card and having all of the heat
concentrated in sort of this area you
have the heat of the VRMs sort of you
know spreading out over those sort of
areas and so thermal that makes this
slightly easier to cool
so that's that's one benefit and
electrically you get the benefit that
with your standard vrm layout when you
have a vrm entirely located on like one
side of the card like if we just ignored
this one's existence
issue with most cards that use that
normal layout is that you actually get
voltage drop at the very high currents
just from the power planes electrical
resistance and that is so that that like
at the really high currents you're gonna
be looking at voltage drops where
basically if you measure the capacitor
on the back of the GPU core so if we go
here right so on a lot of cards if you
measure the voltage onlet's i'm not sure
that this capacitor is v core but I
assume it's v core so assuming this
one's v core if you measured the voltage
on this one and then measured the
voltage on say this one you would
actually see a difference where this one
would measure a couple millivolt slower
and depending on how much current you're
pushing that difference might be say
twenty twenty millivolts or or even more
in some cases
so there's definitely so with the layout
that in V
that's actually not as much of an issue
because they're basically shoving
voltage into the GPU core from both
sides and so the area of the GPU core
where your voltage will be lower should
be this line of capacitors right down
the middle and so in theory that gives
you a slightly more even supply of power
to the GPU core and could lead to a
better overclocking results compared to
the RM layouts where you just have one
strip of phases on one side another
reason why this may be done is just
because of routing the power planes
through the PCB necessitates this layout
to not well there there have definitely
been cards where you've seen like two
rows of vrm phases but that just like
massively exaggerated that voltage drop
issue over over distance
so this layout definitely has some
benefits and in that you basically get
the voltage regulator as close to the
GPU core as possible
for all of the phases so that covers
that look the oddball layout is actually
like that that's a really cool thing to
see and I think going forward for really
large GPUs we're gonna see this kind of
layout more and more often just because
you need so much current and so many
phases that this is the most reasonable
layout to power them you can sort of see
Vega doing the same kind of thing with
the l-shaped vrm that it has that's
similar reasoning there they wanted 12
phases and there's no and if you put the
phases in a line then the power delivery
from the phases to the actual GPU core
well you you take some power losses over
the distance that you need to push the
current so yeah that's it's a pretty
neat vrm layout we have here now in
terms of actual phase count this thing
is an absolute like this is a mess as
far as I'm concerned because this has
one two okay let's not count the chokes
one two three four five six seven eight
nine ten eleven twelve thirteen power
stages and thirteen chokes for them and
the problem with this is the voltage
controller on this card which is
for the vcore VRM is this chip right
over here and that is a monolithic power
systems MP 2888 and that's a ten phase
so I don't actually and the thing is so
right off the bat you might be like okay
so it might be like a six phase getting
doubled but there's no doublers on here
and nvidia like the the thing is they
have a lot of very fancy 12 volt power
rail balancing circuitry on here so I'm
actually so I have the sneaking
suspicion that they do actually have all
ten phases hooked up I just have no idea
how and there's like three and I'm
assuming that there's like three option
phases that are being used for changing
power balance situations for the the
eight pins making sure that both eight
pins are pulling an equal amount of
power is taken care of by the sort of
extra three phases and I'm not sure how
that's hooked up
what's definitely certain is this card
can't have 13 phases interleaving the
voltage controller definitely does not
support that it's it only goes up to ten
phase output but still that is a very
like that is a very high end voltage
controller right there from monolithic
power systems it supports up to five
megahertz switching frequency the power
stages in video is using only go really
or specs like you can run them beyond
that but it's not recommended because
their efficiency will go down the drain
generally that you wouldn't want to run
them above one megahertz so this is a
very high-end you know voltage
controller and actually recently and up
until recently really getting a ten
phase voltage controller wasn't really
possible whatsoever I think around 2000
wellnot around the five 5870 HD Radeon
series UPI semiconductor was actually
making a 12 phase controller but those
all stopped being like nobody that thing
Goll like that's things stopped being
produced and since then it's basically
been only eight phase voltage
controllers for high-end applications
and more recently with basically between
Intel skylake Zeon's which pull an
insane amount of power
and in India Nvidia's ginormous new GPUs
on 12 nanometer we like the 10 phase
voltage controller seems to me coming
back because this is not the only one
that I'm aware of there's also one from
Infineon that also exists so yeah this
this is a this is a high-end part that's
nice to see has a nice square see
interfaces uses PWM vid as all NVIDIA
voltage controllers in recent history
have I am there's no public datasheet
for the chip unfortunately so modifying
this thing is going to be a pain but
anyway so that's the voltage controller
and the end result is that I actually
don't know how the phase phases are set
up I think there's ten phases being
interleaved and then there's like three
phases that come and go depending on
what kind of power balancing situation
you're in also they're probably going to
be dropping in and out of being run just
based on how much for for like for power
capability reasons as well but I am
really like it's really hard to like I
can't give you specifics because it's
just like this is a really oddball vrm
layout now then for the actual power
stages where we're looking at and videos
favorite new power stage the Fairchild
Semiconductor FDM f31
70 power stage this is a 70 amp part
there's actually a bunch of these new 70
amp power stages coming out right now
this is the Fairchild Semiconductor one
and it's actually a smart power stage so
it integrates things like thermal
protections over current protection
current monitoring temperature
monitoring all of that's integrated
directly into the power stage and that
is then you know read back by the by
compatible voltage controllers that's
that's like the special thing is like
all of these extra features actually
need support from the voltage controller
itself and yeah these things are
incredibly powerful the only issue with
them is that the entire datasheet
inspected at 1.8 volts output so for
however so for actual vrm efficiency
figures I'm gonna list both what they
would produce like heat what they
produce at 1.8 volts output as well as
1.2 volt and then for 1.2 volts output
which is still above what Nvidia is
gonna be running these cards on stock
voltage is going to be around 1 volt
well for 1.2 volts output I'm gonna be
scaling them down based on the
International rectifier 3575 power stage
just because most power stages scale
them very similarly with lower voltages
in terms of efficiency so the it like
the the lower voltage efficiency figures
are like they're very rough estimates so
yeah keep that in mind anyway so power
efficiency for the GPU core 1.8 volts
1.2 volts and worth noting is that the
vrm like these power strategies also
aren't specs for switching frequency
lower than 500 kilohertz they are very
efficient actually even at 500 kilohertz
so these are these are really awesome
power stages and I hope we get to see
them used in more and more applications
and there's already some motherboards
using these hopefully they start gaining
popularity especially since Nvidia is
like probably requiring the use of 7tm
power stages for all of their for some
of their twenty series cards it might be
possible that any board part like any
adding board partners for Nvidia that
also make motherboards might start using
these on motherboards just because
they're already gonna be buying them
just to produce NVIDIA GPUs so then
let's start at what I assume stock
current is gonna be stock we're gonna
probably be looking at around something
around 200 amps at 1.8 volts that would
translate to about 20 watt so he output
at 1.2 volts you'd be looking at more
like 16 watts of e heat output so that
is very efficient
yeah that is yeah I mean what did you
expect it's 13 phases worth of 70 M
power stages assuming NVIDIA actually
has the efficiency shaping stuff set up
correctly these things are going to be
absolutely great
thermal results across basically the
entire voltage range then for
overclocking I'm not sure that end video
is gonna give you enough power limit to
go this high but 300 amps you're gonna
be looking at about 34 watts at 1.8
volts and probably about 27 watts at 1.2
volts so this is where I think air
cooled and probably water-cooled
overclocking will also top out then 400
amps this is ice I'd say starting to get
into a sort of dry ice overclocking
territory for these cards which would
also go up to say 500 amps water cooling
may actually overlap somewhat into the
400 amp range I'm not sure really
depends on how much power limit Nvidia
gives these cards so 400 amps you'd be
looking at about 50 watts of heat at 1.8
volts output and about 50 wait no
reading the wrong page 40 watts of heat
at 1.2 volts output so that's only like
you know that's only like 18 watts of
heat on like this VR I'm at 1.2 volts
and 22 watts on this VR M so that should
be like more than kula bewitch just
already tells you how ridiculous this VR
M is like 400 amps and you know 40 watts
and spread across this much surface area
this thing should run ice-cold even if
you didn't have heat like as long as it
gets airflow this thing should run an
ice cold it wouldn't really even need
heat sinks and it's stock settings this
is massive overkill so yeah very very
impressive but it in theory this should
go higher so for 500 amps which would I
think be around we're dry ice
overclocking would top out you'd be
looking at about 68 watts of heat on 1.8
volts and 55 watts of heat on 1.2 volts
now then for ln2 overclocking I must I
might the the current estimates here are
guesswork based on how 1080 tea eyes
behave and then how much larger the 2080
TI is than a 1080 TI and the reason why
I'm estimating like this off of the 1080
Ti is because the 12 nano meter man
factoring process from TSMC doesn't
really make much difference compared to
the 60 nanometers manufacturing process
from TSM see it's the same density it's
slightly more efficient it might have
more leakage I not really you know it
might have more leakage it might have
slightly less leakage it's probably very
very similar to the the 60 nanometer
process because it doesn't have a really
really doesn't have a density increase
it does seem to have slightly better
slightly better voltage frequency curves
but it's not a huge jump so I'm assuming
that an estimate based off of a 10 80 TI
should be pretty accurate so for ln2
you'd be looking at maybe like 600 amps
and I'm assuming around 1.5 volts it
might not scale that high at 600 amps
this vrm would produce about 93 watts of
heat so at this point we're really kind
of getting out of the optimum range for
the efficiency curve as you can see the
current draw jumps are getting bigger
and bigger and 1.2 volts you'd be
looking more at like 75 watts of heat so
you know still should be very hand
manageable if you have enough air flow
over the VRMs and then 700 amps again on
ln2 and this should actually be possible
to hit if this behaves like a 1080 TI
you'd be looking at about a hundred 25
watts at 1.8 volts and about a hundred
watts at 1.2 volts so since on ln2 you'd
actually be sort of around 1.5 volts
maybe one point four volts it would
actually be somewhere in between the
these two figures for the vrm heat
output and that would get very very hot
but if you had like a you know high
enough RPM delta fan and maybe some kind
of heatsink sitting on top of the vrm it
on top of the MOSFETs it should still be
manageable
so especially since you're just gonna be
like it's just gonna need to take that
amount of a current for the duration of
a benchmark it's not like you're gonna
be running back current into it for
hours and hours and hours which would
mean you'd need a much more substantial
cooling system
so yeah this VRM is incredibly it's
really impressive that is for sure and
it is definitely in fact this is the
most powerful vrm nvidia has ever put on
any consumer GPU this vrm here is more
powerful than the VRA than the 2v core
VRMs on a GTX 590 this is more powerful
than the the two VR at V curvy arms of a
GTX Titan Z the only the arm that Nvidia
makes that is more powerful than this is
the one used on there like volta 100
series cards and I think the Pascal 100
cards as well because those are like
compute accelerators and those are
absolutely massive and those are the
only cards that I can think of that I
think how well no the Titan V is the own
load that I know for sure hasn't more
powerful er the RM and the Tesla's based
the Tesla's use the same PCB as the
Titan V but as far as consumer cards go
NVIDIA hasn't made one with a more
powerful vrm than this and honestly like
I welcome this because this is a
founders Edition where it's like you you
know this would actually be the bit this
is one of those cards where like the
number of power connectors is actually a
bigger problem than the the vrm itself
so yeah this this is a very very
impressive vrm and in fact if I was
taking this on Alan to I'd definitely be
hooking up more power connectors because
this in this is a huge die if it scales
to the same voltages and clock speeds
that you know the 10 series did this
thing is gonna pull an insane amount of
power but at least this time around like
the the the vrm is definitely ready for
that so yeah very very impressive PCB
from Nvidia and this is this is one of
the few I don't have anything to
complain about on well actually already
with the 10 series and video really
stepped up their PCV quality and this is
just like at this point it's like the
board partners are gonna have a hard
time designing anything significantly
better than the reference cards and
honestly if you're like considering
water cooling or something then I would
just get a founders Edition I wouldn't
worried about getting a custom card
whatsoever because I the there's nothing
I can really see here that it be like
yeah there's gonna be a significant
upgrade if you got a non founders
edition that's just that's just not
gonna happen
the this is already so freakin up there
in terms of erm build quality that you
know we might like we will be seeing a
custom board point like custom cards
from board partners with 16 phase of
ecore VRMs but it's like about it's not
really gonna make a difference for your
regular overclocking and it might have
some improvement on ln2 but even there
it really might not because this this
this is a 10 phase in terms of
interleaving and it is crazy powerful
crazy powerful so yeah I'm very
impressed with this very very nice vrm
from Nvidia right here now then moving
on to the memory of erm this is just
more of the same same power stages again
the FDM f31 70s from Fairchild
Semiconductor and so these are massive
overkill and this is a three-phase and
it is controlled by this chip over here
which is yet another and monolithic
power systems MP 2888 which in my
opinion this is well that's an older
choice because NVIDIA has other voltage
controllers that they could have used
right there but yeah it's you know
there's nothing wrong with using the
most high end voltage controller
compatible with your cards for basically
everything so the memory BRM is
absolutely massive overkill and from
reading some micron GD dr six product
briefs and just information from micron
on genie dr six the memory system on a
twenty eight ET i should hold around
well the the memory chips themselves
should pull around 30 watts of power
which really isn't that much especially
considering that you have like you know
210 amps of peak output
maximum output capability on the memory
of erm so the memory of Yoram is
ridiculous overkill really this this vrm
should stay in the single digit heat
output because at 20 amps output you're
gonna be looking at around 2 watts of
heat and at 40 amps output you're gonna
be looking at about 3.5 and the gddr5
and you know the GDD r6 is not actually
going to pull 40 amps though it might
scale with voltage if it behaves like
gddr5 x like gddr5 x scaled all the way
up to like 1.5 volts on if you had it on
liquid nitrogen on air cooling you could
reasonably push it to like 1.4 to ish
without too much risk in theory and it
would scale to that but is still memory
system memory chips don't tend to
massively increase in power consumption
even as you raise the voltage and
operating frequency which is kind of
weird about them but it's like I've
checked it and it really doesn't like
you you can crank up the memory
frequency on a lot of say gddr5 by say
50 percent and it only makes like a 20
percent difference in power consumption
so memory is kind of weird like that and
the end result is that the memory of
your arm here is ridiculous overkill and
at stock these chips will be running at
one point three five volts so yeah
that's you know but more nice vrm right
there and now we get to the sort of the
cool stuff while interesting things that
NVIDIA has done around the card to try
help with overclocking so there's these
two buck converter looking circuits
they're not actual buck converters
they're actually power balancing systems
and these are these are what I think is
Nvidia fixing a problem that Nvidia very
much created so the problem that well
I'm not sure how much of a problem it is
I never really tested attended like a
stock 10 Series card that much but
Nvidia runs a per power connector power
limit system and if we think about this
the 1020 atti has a TDP from Nvidia of
250 watts
and in videos TDP very much means that
because of how Nvidia monitors their
GPUs power consumption when NVIDIA says
TDP is 250 watts that means the card
will not pull more than 250 watts and
the reason for that is they have shunt
resistors monitoring power going into
the card on every single input and so I
assume this one right here is for one of
the eight pins I think if I had the card
in hand I could verify that but from the
pictures it just kind of looks like that
one probably is an 8 pin power connector
a pin monitoring shunt and this one I'm
gonna assume is also for an 8 pin and
this one I think is for the PCIe slot so
they basically monitor the power power
going from you know every single 12 volt
source on the card so the 2 8 pins as
well as the PCIe slot and the thing is
in video when they impose their power
limits they might do something like you
know 40 Watts on the slot and then a
hundred and twenty now that's too much
40 okay you know what let's just
simplify this they might go like slot 50
Watts and then the eight pins would be a
hundred watts each and then when you
raise the power limit which in theory
like I'm not sure that they'll even let
you set it to 375 Watts that would be
like a lot normally the Nvidia power
slider goes to like what plus ten
percent maybe but let's say they did let
you go to 375 Watts so then you'd be
looking at like 75 watts on the slot and
then 150 watts for each of the power
connectors and the thing is since you
have this power limit Kerr connector it
is actually possible for the GPU to be
pulling 375 watts in a scenario where
it's pulling 375 watts and it's trying
to pull say 200 Watts from one of the
power connectors and on a 10 series card
that would actually be something that
could happen because of the more basic
power balancing system that they had and
basically when that would happen the
card were throttled because it would
bounce off the power limit for the eight
pin that it's over drawing so to negate
some of that Nvidia has per you
has a new power 12 volt balancing system
which looks like that and that and
there's some other MOSFETs scattered
around the card that I assume also have
something to do with it because there's
a lot of these 12 volt balancing control
chips actually on the card so the idea
behind the 12 volt balance is basically
if they if the card starts going out of
spec on one of the power connectors the
circuitry here can actually switch which
power connector is providing power
switch some of the phases from one of
the eight pins to the other eight pin in
order to get them back into balance and
that would prevent the card from
bouncing off of the per connector power
limit before it hits the total GPU power
limit so you basically kind of get a
more and basically get more power more
usable power limit than on a 10 series
card the thing is if Nvidia just at
least from my perspective is an extreme
overclocker see this 8 pin can perfectly
fine handle 300 watts and this one can
too and so as far as I'm concerned the
power limit for this GPU should be more
like 600 Watts when overclocking and the
per connector power limit it should be
like you know well let's say 650 none of
the phases should be hacked like the
vcore phrases should just not be hang
off hanging off of the PCIe slot and so
50 watts would be for the PCIe slot and
then 300 Watts for each of the power
connectors and NVIDIA as far as I know
has never done this just because they
technically you're violating the PCIe
spec but if you actually look up the
specification for these 8 pin power
connectors they can take 300 Watts just
fine that's not a problem the only issue
that would you could run into is if
somebody's running like a daisy chain
power connector yeah they might overlook
they would overload that daisy chain
because you'd be pulling like 600 Watts
through it but I think honestly Nvidia
could just have a disclaimer like hey if
you want to raise the power limit this
much you need to rewire your GPU or you
run
the risk of melting your power connect
melting your actual cables which would
then potentially lead to a fire if you
have a crappy power supply without
working over current protection and they
do make those so yeah it's just like
it's cool that Nvidia you know is
freeing up more of the power limit by
making sure that you don't bounce off of
the per connector power limit as much as
you used to be as much as it used to
happen on the 10 series I'm still not
like I still think they should have just
given you a higher power limit anyway
for the 12 volt balancing they're
actually using a UPC I semiconductors
you p7 6 v 1q and the other complaint I
have for this and chip is that it
doesn't have a public data sheet but the
description very clearly says that this
thing has over current protection so in
theory you might run into a situation
where like you say you modify the the
shunt the shunt resistors by either
stacking of more shunts on top of them
or just completely replacing them and
then you'd still hit the power limit of
the 12 volt balancing circuits instead
of the the shunts so yeah and also
speaking of the shunts Nvidia has
changed the chips it uses for the
monitoring those they are now instead of
using the Texas Instruments ia32 to one
they have the current monitoring done by
NCP 45 for nine ones and these are
actually for shunt for shunt monitoring
like they can monitor for shunts each
and these don't actually output a nice
square so these don't have a nice Gracey
interface or anything like that they
spit out a differential signal that then
goes into a analog digital controller of
some kind that you know Nvidia basically
chooses it might be fed right back into
the GPU core I'm not sure but basically
this converts the high voltage the high
voltages it measures across the shunts
into low voltages that can be read back
by you know low voltage analog digital
converters like what you would have say
on the GPU core or on some other chip
sitting somewhere on the PCB and these
are much faster than the eye on a 3-2 to
1 and those are also part of the
you know rebalance like the upgrade to
the balancing circuitry and the power
monitoring circuitry from Nvidia because
on the previous cards you know you would
just basically have like a % TDP
indicator now you're gonna have an
actual power draw in indication because
of the the changes they've made to the
power monitoring system and also the 12
volt balancing is now faster thanks to
these the problem I have with these is
that these have a bunch of tiny little
SMDs so modifying these is a bigger pain
than modifying the ia32 2 ones for
higher power limits so on these cards I
would honestly recommend that if you
want to lift the power limit and you're
gonna be using a soldering iron to do it
you're gonna want to put like a 1 if you
want to really blow up the power limit
you're gonna want to like you put a 5
milli ohm shunt on here so that's 0.005
ohms on top of the existing tion you're
gonna get at Wyatt you're gonna get
twice as much power limit so instead of
like the 150 watts you would get 300
watts on the 8 pin assuming that you can
even set it to 150 to start with I'm not
sure and if you wanted to really blow
out the power limit like say if you were
taking the card on in liquid nitrogen or
dry ice you would actually like I would
go all the way down to like a 0.015 ohm
shunt and the reason for that is is if
you actually put that in parallel with a
5 milli ohm shunt you're gonna get like
it was a resistance of like 0.01 1 the
and so then you're gonna get a roughly 5
times increase in power limit at which
point even if you were at stalk you know
which is 250 watts while 250 watts times
5 is what 12 hundred and 50 watts power
limit total for the card so then you
shouldn't have a power limit though you
would have to probably add some extra
power connectors because the 8 pins
they're good to 300 watts they can even
if you have as a power supply with 16
gauge cabling you can even actually push
as much as 468 Watts through each of
these but the thing is you know a
thousand watts is actually even more
than that so you would really want to
add some extra power connectors and it
you were doing that you'd have to add
two of them because I'm not sure how the
12-volt power planes are actually
internally wired on the card and like
you know in theory you could get away
with three powers three power connectors
total but since there's only two to
start with it's gonna be hard to wire up
a third one so you'd have to wire up to
two just keep it even
yeah so that is the twenty atti founders
edition you know really solid PCB on
Elland like vrm is in my like similar to
the 1080 TI this vrm is actually
adequate even for like ln2 overclocking
so if you're on water cooling or air
cooling you have nothing to worry about
except how high is the software power
limit and if you want to modify that you
can just solder you know shunts in
parallel on top of the existing shunts
and that solves that issue it's like the
12 volt balancing stuff like I know I
complained about it but it's still from
an engineering perspective that's a
really cool thing to do because it does
mean that you know they close or follow
the specifications for the eight pin
power connectors though I think you know
you could just ignore those up to a
certain point you can kind of ignore
that but yeah very very solid you know
PCB from Nvidia and as I said you know
it's like it's gonna be really hard like
in my opinion pieces like the there's
not much room for the Adhan board
partners to make a much better PCB for
extreme overclocking I would actually
value the addition of like a third eight
pin power connector which I think I've
seen some cards that might be doing that
getting us extra eight pin power
connector for ln2 that would make sense
but for like daily usage you can just
buy a Founders edition knock yourself
out like that there's not much to
improve on here right like you've got a
really really solid v core vrm massive
overkill on the memory VR I'm the the
new 12 volt balancing stuff which I
don't really care about and yeah there's
I mean what's not to like
this is a really really really sold
card so yeah that's it for the video and
