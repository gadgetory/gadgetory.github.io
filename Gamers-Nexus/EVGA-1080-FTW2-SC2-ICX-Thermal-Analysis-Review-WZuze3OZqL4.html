directly measure vram and vrm component
temperatures which is a direct response
to the thermal pad to moles that we
exhaustively tested a few months ago at
this point the icx cooler theoretically
addresses the fact that GP diode
temperature is no longer is the most
important point of thermals on a video
card and that other components run
hotter due to the now lower fan speeds
as a result of the GPU governed PWM we
have some parts custom-made to validate
individual component temperatures of IC
X and AC x coolers since the EVGA makes
big claims without each individual
addition to the new IC x cooling block
for example the aluminum fins they call
the pin fin the backplate and the holes
in the heatsink itself we validated
these claims individually rather than
just testing the cooler as a whole
versus the old cooler and have sc2 and
ftw2 cards on the table before getting
to that this content is brought to you
by our patreon supporters who helped
fund in-depth and unique testing like
this this type of depth and custom
tooling is made easier by supporting at
patreon.com slash gamers nexus EVGA Zhai
CX and a CX cards will coexist with one
another they are gapped by about $30 in
price who is a $30 price of Delta
between IC x and AC x and that extra
cost is basically split between the
addition of thermistors across the board
and then the cooler overhaul alongside
some other additions like to emcee use
for processing the data from the
thermistors of course the thermistors
use our negative type they are NTC
thermistors and that means that they
respond to higher temperatures with
lower resistance that's how the
temperature measurement is it created in
the various components that we're
testing so for these IC x cards they've
got placements near the BRM components
the memory components and it's placed
adjacent not directly atop the casing
for each of these devices the services
are used to allow individual control of
these ii v RM fans but i'd be the fan on
the right so the BRM temperature can be
independent it's no longer bound to GPU
pwm signals which is somewhat flawed at
this point because GPUs have become a
power efficient enough that they don't
require as high of a fan rpm to keep
cool but the
are still burning because it's not
feasible to place these thermistors
directly below a vga device like a VRAM
module EVGA places the thermistors
closeby with some sensors landing on the
backside of the PCB we actually acquired
some PCB diagrams that show the
placement of each thermistor shown on
the screen now the top side of the ftw2
PCB has three thermistor is located near
but not atop the vram modules there are
four more thermistors that located
topside for the power component
coincidentally EVGA is measuring the
same power components we used in our
huge EVGA vrm thermal benchmark a few
months back and that's been MOSFET
number two counting from the bottom up
MOSFET number seven and MOSFET number
ten and they're also measuring the
memory vrm temperature we generally
agree with EB J's placement and specific
positioning of the thermistors because
the number to the second from the bottom
that set specifically gets a little warm
because it is closest to the motherboard
so depending on the airflow and the case
use that can get pretty highs flanked by
two other power stages and phases on
either side so it's going to get warmer
the seventh one is in the middle of the
board it's going to be the warmest there
because it's got components all around
it and then the tenth one we didn't
really use an hour testing but EB J's
added it to their IC x cooler this
bottom side diagram shows the rest of
the thermistor locations one of which is
an additional GPU diode backside
measurement the other is the one volt
PLL minor rail which is used for non
compute functions and can mostly be
ignored as for the component level
analysis this board is largely the same
as the previous EVGA FTW 1080 vrm we
previously worked with build Zoid to
analyze that board and his analysis
remains accurate we'll put a link in the
cards for that video EVGA has switched
one main stain for the vrm instead of
using the NCP eight one three eight to
fetes that they reason previously
they've now switched to fairchild at
thirty thirty five sets the previous
fest used on the FTW boards were rated
for thirty five amps continuous the new
ones are rated for 50 amps continuous
and continues EVGA is way overkill
designed to the vrm on these cards the
NCP FET if you recall our PCB analysis
of that is a combination of the high
side the lows
and the driver I see so moving to
Fairchild really we're just getting a
higher-quality fetch so 30 35 that's
used but in terms of your usability for
overclocking you probably won't see a
huge difference and the vrm it truly is
overkill EVGA is still using a five
phase that's doubled with the NCP eight
one one six to doublers that builds a
detailed in that vrm analysis the same
voltage controllers also used with the
same four hundred chillers pwm into the
doubler which then splits into two 200
kilohertz signals for the phases this
means that your power quality is the
same as a five phase so the 10 faves
design is almost entirely a marketing
stunt and not really all that relevant
to overclocking quality that said going
for 10 phase does mean EVGA can spread
the heat out over a wider area which is
probably the main thing they're going
for here as for the memory vrm that's
still the same on semi 4c 805 and a high
and low side faites if the thermistor
and power design interests you further
please check the link in the description
below for the full article where we've
got a lot of depth on the IC x cooler
and the ACX cooler and that mostly
covers the basics there are a ton of
small changes made to the cooler itself
like EB J's newfound obsession with
thermal pads wonder what triggers that
but we'll test each of those
individually in the thermal benchmarking
for the records those pads are rated at
1.2 watts per meter Kelvin before
getting to the testing to clarify a few
things the cards themselves the SC 2 and
F TW two cards are largely the same as
the AC X 3.0 versions the only
difference again that one set change for
the VR M is different and then the
cooler is different the cooler in
addition to the thermistors is really
the only thing here that's the main
focus point because even the clock rate
is the same between an f TW which I have
over here at ftw2 the clock rate is the
same so the only thing that you're going
to see that will cause any variance at
all on fps between these two devices is
going to be GPU boost 3.0 which is
Nvidia's boost functionality there's
different boost variants one GPU to the
next so unless you had a massive sample
size you really can't firmly state that
one is better than the other and it
doesn't matter anyway because the GPUs
are
going to boost to whatever o'clock rate
they want and performance other than
that will remain the same you might see
one FPS variance so we're not doing FPS
benchmarking with these cards there may
be some in the article but not in this
video we're focusing entirely on the
things that matter here which again is
just going to be thermals for this
benchmark in terms of the ACS 3.0 cards
if you are an owner of SC or FTW before
getting some tests you should know that
you can upgrade for 100 dollars we'll
talk about whether or not that's
actually worth it in the conclusion I
have that you should probably stick
around for if you're thinking of
upgrading but the plan is basically $100
step up you can send them there your FTW
or your SC and then you get the
equivalent IC X version back let's get
into the test in our complete thermal
testing methodology is defined in great
detail in the article includes
description below this one is a really
detailed article so be sure to check it
out if you don't normally with regard to
basic testing we use it logging software
to monitor the NPC's on EVGA ACX card
and we use our own calibrated
thermocouples mounted to power
components individually which we can
also use the further validate EVGA zone
thermistor placement and accuracy our
thermocouples use an adhesive pad that
is 1/100 of an inch thick and does not
interfere in any meaningful way with
thermal transfer the pad is a
combination of polyamide and poly methyl
phenyl siloxane and the thermocouple is
a K type hooked up to a login meter we
also had a custom plate made to allow us
to individually test the components of
icx cooler as stated previously note
that we are using the same SC 2 card for
these side-by-side
ACH versus icx comparisons that is
critical because the GPU for each test
again can have some very intim that's
also why there's not much fps difference
between one to the next
other than GP boost as for the ftw2
testing we're comparing that against the
straight a CF 2.0 FTW card strictly
because of the vrm issues we talked up
previously and we're using the same
methodology for our vram and so don't
pad towards your testing that we used
previously let's start with that one
this chart shows temperature versus time
for our thermocouples that we mounted
all over the AC X and
FTW cards yellow orange and red
represent temperatures for the ACX cards
that be the warmer colors not to do that
intentionally but warmer colors for
those and then maybe Andrew can
highlight those on the screen green teal
and blue which is buried by the lighter
blue represent the icx card white
represents the ambient temperature which
is a modifier that we applied to
equalized room temperature as it relates
to performance as it's done by
collecting ambient for each test pass
note that getting these numbers is only
possible using our trusted thermocouple
method that we've tested previously
since the ATX FTW did not have EVGA
these new sensors with our testing we're
seeing MOSFET number seven and number
two are mostly equal on the ftw2
represented by the blue colors with both
maxing out around seventy to seventy two
point five Celsius comparatively the FTW
ACX cooler posts fat number seven and
number two at around 76 to 79 tells us
and that's a temperature improvement of
between four and nine C on the MOSFET
the back side of the PCB also shows
tremendous improvement with the green
line indicating we've now mostly
achieved parity with the front side set
temperatures this is largely
attributable to the new backplate and
reduced vrm temperatures overall because
those do bleed through the PCB although
it's not the most efficient transfer now
we're moving into the SC two AC x versus
IC x comparison which is where things
get interesting we're using our custom
plates to test the performance on the
same a card and GPU with a controlled
fan speed of 1700 rpm on both fans even
the vrm fan we're testing with
combustors per mark again to burnin
power stages we're also using EB J's new
thermistor readings and first we're
looking at the difference of just the
back plates this first test was done
using the IC X cooler its entirety with
only the back plate swapped we ran this
test specifically because the EVGA
suggested that the new back plate had a
big impact on thermals as shown here the
temperature difference is roughly within
one Celsius for power five power for
power one and memory one and also GN zat
MOSFET number two thermocouple and even
the GPU diode we see a much larger
difference in power to and memory 3
which is more of a factor of where those
thermistors are located than anything
let's look now how the entire cooler
performs versus AC x3
no adding in those numbers of the same
rpm between the coolers we see that GPU
temperature is effectively identical
with unusual test variants and our
thermocouple on set number two shows an
improvement of approximately 6000 versus
a CX if we highlight power you'll see
that this holds it true there as well
we're seeing that several degrees
improvement on the second set no matter
how its measured the difference between
these measurements is that UGA is using
a thermistor placed adjacent to the FET
while we're using a thermocouple mounted
atop effect casing neither is perfect as
for other temperatures memory temps on
the left side are down in
consequentially with performance
improving drastically as we approach the
inductors and capacitors Bank toward the
right that the memory number 3 which
needs an improvement of about 14 salties
in our testing just to throw in a
comparative charge versus other vendors
this benchmark shows all cards set to
their auto settings and adjusted for the
delta T value that we measured during
testing EVGA is icx FTW to Land's at
around 48 celsius delta T load with it
almost eight degrees Celsius delta T
idle temperature the latter temperature
is seemingly high as a result of the
idle fans when it's not actually doing
anything of course you can have a higher
temperature idle so former doesn't look
impressive because the EVGA is opted to
allow for an excessively warm GPU in
exchange for improved noise levels while
leveraging their new independently
controlled BRM fan to keep power under
control this is how the icx card is
meant to be used and is why the GPU
temperature is no longer the full story
speaking of noise well we'll take a look
at those with Auto fan speed and stress
testing workloads we generally saw the
FTW too icx cooler opting to run at CPU
fan 1900 rpm and via ramp an at 2100 rpm
with these configured and with all
passive cooling on the CPU power supply
and everything else in the bench we're
seeing a noise output of 46.2 DBA
this is the only components in the
system making noise when we moved to a
fixed 1,700 1,700 fan speed we're seeing
a noise output of about 40 1.8 1400 by
1600 which is where we were operating
when averaged over low load gaming puts
us at 38.2 DBA and 1700 by 1800 is where
we operated during most gaming workloads
of sort of triple-a titles that's what
you should expect for the most part and
that configuration had us just over 42
da we also have before and after V BIOS
update numbers for the original AC fftw
card which uses fans that are physically
identical other than the MCU control
those are on here as well
EVGA is decision to launch IC acts at
this point is a little interesting
Pascal is not new and there are new
cards theoretically around the corner so
why would they do it well it's really
just because they've got this big AC X
thing looming over them you search for
any of their cards on Google you'll
probably run into thermal testing maybe
our vrm testing maybe their forums and
it's enough to cause concern for new
buyers now just to kind of recap what we
said previously with the updated VIII
bios which is not necessary if you have
the thermal pad and the thermal pads the
AC x cards are fine there well with an
operating temperature the V RMS can
handle a lot more temperature than the
cards are putting out especially with
those updates so if you're on one of
those you're fine but from EVGA is
perspective their strategy is to get out
from under this by putting out a new
card with a new name so it's not going
to bring up all this controversy from a
few months ago so that's the reasoning
for launching icx now the next thing is
if you own an AC X card you could trade
it in with a hundred dollar bill in the
envelope and get an ICS card is it worth
it well not really the only main reason
to do that is if you want new toys to
play with because again if you have an
AC X card and you've done the thermal
pad mod which is free for most countries
anyway it's fine those temperatures are
operating just fine the only reason
you'd really need to do the trade in
would be for resale value because that
will probably go up on my CX cards the
AC X ones are again painted by that
image even though it is largely a
non-issue at this point as we've stated
in a very detailed long video but resale
is really the main reason to upgrade
because clock rates the same fps is
basically going to be the same
temperature is yes are really improved
in a lot of places on the board not all
of them but everywhere that we would
like to see the improvement EVGA has
improved temperatures but that's not
necessarily the reason to upgrade a card
not for 100 bucks anyway if you're a new
buyer though and you don't own an AC X
this should absolutely be on your raid
icx has made excellently informed
engineering decisions and from a testing
standpoint these cards are going to be
much easier to work with from an
enthusiast standpoint you have a lot
more sliders and toys to play with which
is always a cool thing folks who don't
yet only ten series cards should be
seriously considering icx and that's
really mainly for the finer tune control
over temperature noise and these fans
are exceptionally rare these days
generally for a heatsink
for a video card which is all these are
heat sinks and coolers you don't see
much improvement the innovation is in
different thin design and this has gone
a bit further than that so we hope EVGA
licenses its patents that are relevant
to this to other vendors so they can
begin adding thermistors to critical non
GP components as well for another point
if you're curious about EVGA thermistor
accuracy we validated them with our own
thermocouples by being basically
adjacent and the thermistors are
perfectly precise from one task to the
next showing almost no variance under
controlled conditions it's a good thing
that means you can run the tests and
trust the numbers which was the first
question we had we also found EVGA
temperatures to closely match our own
thermocouple temperatures despite be in
place technically off the package from
the components they're measuring and
another point still EVGA has added a 10
amp fuse to the icx cards that will blow
before any major power issues occur so
the chance of this happening should
really be indefinitely small to begin
with but you'll now have a fuse
protecting the rest of your computer in
the event something does go wrong that
alone is a major critical move and
hopefully other vendors adopt this if
they haven't already so with the $30
price difference value is good for folks
who don't yet own a video card of this
class but again we say skip it if you're
on a CX with the thermal pad mod and if
you don't have a CX or anything else get
a CX and get I see a and a final
reminder again FPS performance is the
same so look up FTW or SC for more
benchmarks on that we've tested both of
them Pascale still has a hard stop
around 2100 megahertz or thereabout so
you're not going to get much more
overclocking out of the new cards either
despite having a different vrm overall
job well done by EVGA with this
improvement and iteration the $100
upgrade is a nice way to try and help
people who might feel burned by
the previous purchase but it's not
necessary either for you to actually
upgrade so defuse the cooling apparatus
the thermistors all good additions
hopefully these get carried onward into
new cards if you like this coverage is
