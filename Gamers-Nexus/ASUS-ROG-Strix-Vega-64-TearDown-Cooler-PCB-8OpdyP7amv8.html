was over it was past and behind us Vegas
back so yeah we just did coffee like
that's kind of cool but also Vegas still
a thing and it will remain a thing for a
while because these cards the partner
cards are taking forever to ship so we
got one of the first Asus ones one of
the first partner models at all off the
line and we're gonna tear it down today
it's not quite ready for benchmarking
yet waiting for a few more driver tweaks
and things like that and someone out
there is supremely lucky because they
got our stolen or lost first shipment of
this card so congratulations I hope you
enjoy having one of the only Vega units
out there that's an AI V partner model
but I wish that we had it earlier so
yeah we're gonna tear this apart today
I'll be looking at the VR I'm a bit but
the plan it's a forward all the
information to build Zoid he's gonna do
a video for us analyzing the vrm and
then I'll be analyzing the cooler in
this teardown we'll get to the cooling
benchmarks and all that stuff sometime
next week probably after we're done with
coffee like before we get into that this
content is brought to you by the thermal
take flow RGB closed-loop liquid cooler
which is a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator plus three 120 fans
that are RGB illuminated if they're on
we'll take it ring fans at that this is
a 4.5 done a stack pump which is one of
the faster pumps you can learn more at
the link in the description below
alright so the basics of this one pretty
straightforward
this looks pretty similar to the other
Strix coolers like the 1080i one just a
bit smaller and the 1080i cooler just to
remind everyone the Strix ROG 1080i be
reviewed remains one of the best in
terms of noise normalized performance
that we've tested by which I mean at 40
DBA
it has the best cooling performance of
all the air-cooled cards we've
benchmarked and we've tested like 10 or
11 1080 t eyes so it's got some serious
critical acclaim there at the 1080i
Strix rog is a good card
we'll see if Asus is able to transfer
that design to this Vega 64 card now our
opinions on Vega 64 are pretty well
known generally speak
you should just buy 56 if Vega at all
but the cooler it's gonna be worth
testing for sure to see how ACS has
improved over the reference blower
design with its 60 to 70 DB a fan and
unlimitedly bad cooling potential so I'm
sure they've improved on it but let's
take it apart so this thing I don't know
if Asus is gonna ship a 56 model of this
exact cooler because I don't know if
that'll fit their price targets I don't
even know what this is gonna cost to be
honest with you but we can at least take
it apart look at the cooler see what
Asus has done we already kind of know
what Andy's done with these cards quite
well at this point so you got a tamper
seal it doesn't say warranty void if
removed that doesn't mean they won't
void your warranty but some of these
companies like EVGA and even so attack
actually although you do need to open
though tax cards to fix the thermal so
it makes sense they would allow it but
some of these companies do allow the
user to access the back side of the card
or even the inside the card without
voiding the warranty they just put the
seal on there so that they know you've
done it that way they can see a little
more diligent when checking what you've
done and I haven't taken this apart yet
so I'm not positive what all needs to
come off but clearly that's gotten the
bulk of it okay so I think we're gonna
have to go through all these or actually
it's just - isn't it so for for the
cooler mounting to the PCB through the
backside - over here any other screws on
this side that's gonna be the shortest
teardown ever there's a yellow thermal
pad that's a bit different anyway so
base plate clearly if you're not
familiar with these there's no gddr5 the
HBM is right there on top of the
substrate and this is oh that's kind of
cool this is a bit different this is a
non molded version I'm gonna need I will
test contact pressure with this I have I
have contact paper to test with so
notice how next to the HBM right here
notice how that is actually like a
different height so this this interposer
that's what that is
is a different height from the HBM the
dye that's because there's a difference
in how the package is put together and
some of them have a sort of mold over
them where this actually interposer has
a layer on top of it that comes up to
meet the HBM and some of them don't this
one clearly doesn't want to valorize
others does and that's part of one of
the earlier concerns when talking with
AV partners about Vega where that was a
difference you know you lose some of the
potential support there and then also
I'll check this as well but the height
of the HBM on some devices is different
than the height of the GPU by like 40 I
don't know micrometers or something very
very tiny like that not gonna be able to
see it with my eyes almost certainly but
we can measure it I have I bought tools
for all that stuff when I heard about it
so we'll be able to do all that that'll
be kind of cool but the review will wait
till after the rest of the coffee lake
stuff so anyway to get this apart we are
once you're under the shroud you just go
through and remove screws going through
to the back plate I will let us get the
back plate off also little pin fin thing
not really pin fins I guess but a little
heatsink that looks like it's on the
memory of erm actually what's how is our
house our core VR and being cooled so
first of all they put a lot of thermal
paste on there which is great some
companies cheap out on it core vrm is
being cooled through what's that that's
seriously packing materials in here
I don't know about a one millimeter
they're all pad into a solid base plate
looks like an aluminum base plate and
then that is just going into the fin
stack as you would expect right here at
which point the air is taking care of
the rest from the three fan cooler as
for heat heat pipes we have a total of
one two three four five five coming
through to this side which is the vrm
side and then we've got a couple extras
one two over here three I think that
covers all of them I think that's all
and then what else was of note okay so
of note now as we showed with the
reference PCB the reverends PCB is
really damn good it's gonna be hard for
these companies to do a better job than
AMD already did and part of what AMD did
was they had an l-shaped vrm that
actually flanked the GPU like this which
helps in a few ways it's an ideal vrm
setup it gets all components as close to
the GPU as possible rather than over
here where they are where it's obviously
some of its a bit further than others so
you get some propagation delays at this
layout how relevant is that I'm not
really sure but speaking ideally when
you get rid of gddr5 memory you do free
up space on the PCB
that allows for more optimized BRM
layout into the shape of an L where you
minimize things like propagation delays
so is this loose yet it's one more no
one more again
not one more again at some point it
stops being one more all right get out
of there so as you can see clearly it's
just it's a normal vrm so it is synced
into a thermal pad that goes into an
aluminum base plate this aluminum yes
that's gonna be right here on the PCB
this thing is pretty uninteresting it's
basically a retention kit more than a
base plate at this point so for the
other components and check the voltage
controller over here we have an IR three
five two one seven that's a film
familiar apart and for the rest of the
pin outs we had what one that was power
for RGB one that's a emerged fan header
which I believe is right is this RGB
element or what is this that is RGB
actually you can see that like a light
tube in there that's kind of neat so
light pipe in there that's that clear
pipe that looks like hot glue glue stick
that pipes down and that's on both sides
that's how they're doing their RGB LEDs
which connect through this PCB in here
so you got a four pin that plugs into
the board this is a PCB that connects to
the LED light pipes which again are kind
of hard to see on the camera but they're
down there near the screw driver and
those pipe down the sides the fans come
through this header so this has got
power and everything for the fans
that's merging three different fan
cables from the three fans into one and
that one cable plugs into the PCB where
we also have two four pin fan headers so
you could get some case fans to slave or
work with the GPU so you plug those in
there and under that is an RGB header
that's what that is you can plug that
into compatible RGB kits if you want to
synchronize the video card with
everything else at the expense of adding
more cables oh and then we've also got a
dual BIOS up here that's what that
switches
note to self it defaults to the forward
position but it does have two positions
so it's already pretty nice card I'll
leave to build Zoid whether the vrm is
better than am DS I'm not actually sure
that's his domain but the things I want
to point out here dual BIOS is great
good to see that they continue that
trend from AMD despite having a custom
PCB as evidenced by the fact that it's
taller and has different vrm the silicon
down here this difference as I was
saying where the inner poseur is that a
different it's got different molding on
it than other models that's not an Asus
thing that's an AMD thin it depends on
where which factory comes out of when
it's packaged and then let's go ahead
and just take out the backplate just in
case there's anything special back there
but I don't think there is it's worth
looking like I said IR 217 which are 35
to 17 the voltage controller 35:55 for
the FETs of which there are I think I
said 13 of them on two three four yeah
13 13 bets okay cool
that's an LED plate on the back got some
caps but that's really about it it looks
like there's your back LED plate with
the digital LED and all we have back
here is just some caps so nothing
special there so ever the cooler setup
this is a nickel plated copper cold
plate contacting GPU and the HBM synched
into a multi six millimeter heat pipe
solution I think
I think I said six of them and synced
into two radiators which is what these
fin stacks are and then we've got over
here direct contact to the MOSFETs and
then not direct contact I don't think -
yeah - the inductors so the inductors
aren't directly touching this heatsink
they're close to it but they're gonna be
more cooled by air than by metal and the
inductors can handle it these things
right here the chokes as they're called
so these chokes are inductors it inside
of this if you were to break one apart
it's a copper coil wrapped around in
circles
it can take 120 well more than that take
150 C in a lot of cases and be just fine
125 150 C so those don't need the direct
cooling but I mean sometimes companies
like EVGA will do it anyway out of
paranoia
we are not cooling the cap line over
here the capacitor bank and then the
rest is just kind of hanging over so all
this stuff just hangs over the card here
there's no nothing really hot there to
speak of the voltage controller is not
gonna get that hot so all the core
actually hot stuff right here and right
here is all taken care of and then we'll
test that how effective it is in the
review so I think that wraps us up that
is the Asus Strix gaming ROG card I
don't know what it's gonna cost I don't
know if they're gonna have a Vega 56
model there are a lot of things I don't
know about this card right now but we
know about the cooler and we know a bit
about the vrm so check back for build
Zoids full vrm analysis where he'll be
talking about if it's actually good and
if it actually beats the one Andy has on
the reference design and then also if
it's worth the money by then we should
know a price subscribe for more as
