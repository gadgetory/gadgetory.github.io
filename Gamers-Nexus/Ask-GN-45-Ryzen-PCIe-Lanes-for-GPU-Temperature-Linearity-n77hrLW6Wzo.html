ask GN coming out of the AMD risin event
from earlier this week and we've got
another one coming up so a lot of travel
in about a six day period and we've got
benchmarking of course for rising going
on in between check back for the review
once that's live don't jump up there so
the risin question that I've seen a few
places is about PCIe lanes people keep
asking how many PCIe gen3 does lanes
does I have for the GPU we've answered
this several times now but I guess just
to do it one more time and maybe we'll
put this in the title this time so it's
more it's easier for people to find
we've got a block diagram that we made
earlier this month or actually last one
that just after CES that diagram shows
everything put that on the screen I
suppose so you can see in the diagram
again that we made its sixteen a PCIe at
3.0 lanes off of the CPU going to the D
GPU and then those can be MUX t' which
is not special there's just some boards
have markers on them or pax chips
through px and we've seen that with
amasai boards at CES and a couple of the
other am4 motherboards but it's 16 lanes
out of the CPU for the GPU then there
are another 4 PCIe lanes going to the
chipset that's X 370 P 350 etc and then
that splits into your PCIe gen 2
general-purpose or a USB 3 lanes and
there are also PCIe gen3 lanes that act
as i/o and those go into other devices
which again we've got in this block
diagram you can see the three choices
it's a pic 1 scenario so a B or C in pic
those that is the PCIe lanes set up on
Rison it's nothing crazy
as far as strictly GPU again 16 lanes
out of the CPU itself which is sort of
an SOC at this point and then the rest
is just the usual IO Lane assignments if
you want to run em about 2 devices via
PCIe rather than SATA so that hopefully
answers the question it's very simple if
you wanted to run one x16 card you could
if you wanted to run 2 by 8 you could or
you could start muxing and go down as as
desired depending on the
motherboard and the support for the
board next question is from Sir Papa who
says question for next Sen our delta
temperature is affected by room
temperature more than just subtraction
for example the air is 20 degrees on the
cpu's at 50 the deltas at 30 as usual
but if the air is 30 with the CPU then
run at 60 or would it be hotter this is
a really good question this is basically
asking is temperature when you're using
delta T going to be a linear scale and
the answer is it depends now we use
delta T for a few reasons one of them is
because the fluctuation is normally so
small that a nonlinear scaling is kind
of irrelevant it tends to be within a
degree or so with a lot of our tests if
that depending on kind of which room
they were running and what coolers were
used in things like that but as for the
answering the question I actually I
ended up reaching out to VSG from
thermal bench and VSG I've worked with
for a while now on kind of validating
externally some of our thoughts and our
test methods
he runs thermal bench he as I understand
it is some form of post doctorate
researcher does a ton of work with
thermal equipment that plenty of folks
don't have access to so the guy is
definitely credentialed to answer so I
asked and the answer was more about
read-through here if the thermal
resistivity of the die or package is a
linear function also then sure it would
be linear with older CPUs and he says
the even up to 22 nanometers it was
mostly fine meaning mostly a linear
scaling between ambient and the IHS or
whatever might be measured VSG then said
I did a test of my 4770k with no heat
load in my hot box and just buried the
hot box ambient temperature from 25 to
80 Celsius in increments of 2 Celsius at
a time he then it mapped the average CPU
core temperature and the increase in the
average core temperature was nearly the
same as the increase in the ambient
temperature after steady-state was
reached which admittedly took a few
hours at times and then VSG also says I
had a thermistor in contact with the IHS
and the increase in IHS
was not the same even with study state
accounted for the slope of increase was
higher for the IHS than the CPU cores
but the IHS slope of increase was but
the IHS varied between 1.4 Celsius
increase to 2.2 or 2.4 Celsius increase
due to the lower temperature increase of
previous cycles so he's saying that the
results was slightly off one point four
to two point something Celsius between
ambient which was controlled in a hot
box and the IHS and says that was a
result of the thermal resistivity of the
IHS alloy having a quote hyperbolic
function with temperature so it started
off slow and then picked up as such once
it picked up with heat transfer to the
CPU cores also changed so it's basically
for the particular chip you test in the
4770k and potentially onward it was a
nonlinear function increase from the
ambient temperature of the hot box and
the IHS temperature or the core
temperature as it may be
so they forty on one did not equal 40 on
the other they were offset by one point
four to two point four cell Z's in this
particular example he later told me that
with the more densely packed 40
nanometer chips this might be
exacerbated so that's something to
certainly keep in keep in mind and we
have a lot of challenges to look into
with rise and thermal benchmarking and
previously FX had some similar
challenges so this is something we're
researching for Rison most of the
benchmarks I've done with CPU
temperature thus far meaning non cooler
temperature but the CPU reviews those
thermal benchmarks I tend to do within
generation or within chip so just 7700 K
benchmarked at different voltages things
like that so then you're looking at just
a delta one bench to the next rather
than looking across architecture because
for a lot of reasons that's not always
easy especially if you're relying on
software measurements for the
temperatures because again as previously
Andy at least with FX and we'll talk
about rise and shortly
does not use the same temperature scale
as Intel so they're not linearly
comparable but back to the ambient stuff
VSU kind of concluded by saying what
started off as a nice trend of CPU core
temps increasing linearly with ambient
temps suddenly went all over the place I
imagined tighter packed eyes and with
end 14 editor process on Andy and Intel
will be worse in this regard so
basically he was seeing something like a
40 Celsius for ambient and an IHS
temperature of maybe thirty five point
four or forty two thousand ambient and
37.7 IHS something like that so no it's
not perfectly linear we had a pretty
long conversation about it but there's
plenty more but that's the basics check
out thermal bench for more of that type
of stuff next question is from ramos
studios who says hey Steve I was
wondering if I were to remove the fan
from an air cooler such as the 212 Evo
or dark rock pro 3 could the cooler
still provides a sufficient cooling to
the chip relying just on the airflow
generated by the case fans ask because
some of the newer air coolers are big
and chunky and look like they can
dissipate a lot of heat but the fans are
loud or ruin the aesthetic of the cooler
the 212 Evo I absolutely would not
remove the fan from that is not an
impressive cooler by any stretch it's
okay and there's a reason it's like 30
bucks or less so now I would not remove
the fan from the 212 Evo depending on
your CPU of course that is worse or
better because of the lower TDP chips
it's not going to be such a problem when
you're running something like maybe 40
watt chip under the the cooler but I
still wouldn't take the fan off because
you could always just run it out of
lower rpm
it doesn't have to be allowed that
doesn't fix your aesthetics problem but
you could run a lower rpm and at least
just get some airflow through there
because the the fins will sink the heat
and they'll sit there waiting to be
dissipated so if it's not dissipating
the heat you kind of run out of room to
to soak the heat from the CPU there are
passive coolers though and they are
massive Zalman made one years ago is it
some Zalman cube cooler it looked like a
Borg cube
and that I believe had no fan it was a
passive cooler and I don't know if it
was even anywhere remotely within spec
for the socket because it was a heavy
thing so possible yes but you generally
don't use them with overclocking ksq
type CPUs don't use them with higher TDP
CPUs and they need to be huge if they're
gonna be passive so I would not
recommend taking the fan off and just
rely on the case airflow because it's
not gonna be as directed and the air
pressure by the time that air gets to
the CPU cooler the air pressure is not
gonna be that high so you it's off it
might as well be passive really next
question Laura's passage says hey Steve
got a question while we all eagerly
await the launch of bikers Nexus I've
heard a surprising number of people say
that there are inherent compatibility
issues when mixing and matching AMD
Intel and NVIDIA components when
building a PC for example some say that
you should only go with an AMD GPU if
you're going with an AMD CPU as well are
there compatibility problems between and
the GPUs and Intel CPUs do NVIDIA GPUs
have compatibility issues with Andy CPUs
it goes on to ask more about that is it
safe to mix and match components I know
everyone pretty much knows the answer to
this I think on our channel but I wanted
to point out just as a more basic
question no it doesn't really matter
there's not gonna be performance
compatible there should be compatibility
issues between those platforms listed
what would matter is if you are trying
to go with something like the dual GPU
setup that AMD can do between some of
their ap use and some of their lower end
graphics cards that would require of
course and I am the APU and an AMD GPU
to work you can't use that otherwise and
that's because there's some memory
unification there and whenever you do
any kind of unifying of memory you want
direct access to the memory controller
on whatever CPU or APU it is and if
you're going across architecture it's
not it's there's normally some latency
because you can't get direct access
among other things but that would be the
only instance where it really matters
there are other things in sort of
enterprise environments where and videos
got there special interface for their
high end tesla class accelerators
but that's not something will ever
encounter when we're using PCIe so now
does not really there's no no inherent
compatibility Intel and AMD can't work
together if you wanted to name the GPU
on an Intel motherboard or something
next question Justin vishton says any
chance you guys will test the heat pipes
on motherboard v arms actually how cool
anything or are they just there for show
yeah I'm interested in it so to sort of
reiterate what I've said in the past a
lot of these better VRMs that have
enough surface area I mean enough phases
are just good enough components in the
vrm don't necessarily need that heatsink
to begin with because VRMs again can
sustain 125 150 Celsius something like
that so a lot of the time the heatsink
is for show it's hopefully still helped
sink the heat if it's got fins and
contact and it's aluminum or copper or
something you're still soaking heat and
hopefully still spreading it
anticipating it and heat spread is
always a good thing well for the most
part but that doesn't mean that they
need to be cooled by passive heat sinks
it just means that it's not a bad idea
now you could take them off in a lot of
instances if you wanted to again so
these overclockers like I was talking
about with build Zoids comment
previously some of these overclockers
just ripped the heat sinks off anyway
and they don't need them on there but as
for the heat pipes and things like that
you'd assume for the most part that they
work unless it's there are a couple
examples where on motherboards I've seen
bad heat sink designs like the MSI gain
Pro carbon which big surprise
the vrm heatsink there is just a giant
block of aluminum and solid all the way
through and there's no fins so it just
like if you put a a 2 inch cubed block
of copper or aluminum on a CPU it would
be a lot worse in that state cooling or
a sinking heat then if you finned it so
if you dice it into fins and you remove
some of the mass so it's it's actually
less copper or aluminum ash but it has
more surface area because you've diced
it and there
that will cool a whole lot better than
just a solid block of aluminum on top of
VRM a bunch of MOSFETs so there are
definitely bad designs but it should
still sync keep better than nothing and
you still probably don't need it overall
but no I haven't tested any specifically
it is something we have the capability
and the tools to do and I'm interested
in it but we've got plenty to deal with
them to shield and all the other thermal
stuff with Rison and everything else
right now
next question Josh Orenburg has been a
supporter for a long time asks question
for the next stn what's the difference
between the advertised endurance as in
the warranty and raw NAND endurance for
an SSD should the SSD last significantly
longer as indicated by Ron and endurance
or should it only last as much as
indicated in the warranty my samsung eep
850 Evo is seventy five terabytes on the
warranty where it's 500 Ron and
endurance for this one this is one I'm
only bringing up not because I know the
best answer off the top of my head but
because I know the best place to get the
answer and it's it's I would prefer to
point use a it's a tech report for this
one so tech report back when Scott was
still there running the show and when
his I forget the guys name one of his
staffers at the time I think the guy has
since left was doing a bunch of SSD nan
tests and so they set up test benches
with SSDs running non-stop for a really
long time I think it was at least a year
or at least approaching a year so they
had several disks on there I think they
had Intel they had Samsung absolutely
this one may have been included and they
just burned them tons of reads and
writes so they're going through the p/e
cycles non-stop for this whole period to
see which SSDs died when do they die and
who hangs on the longest almost like a
survivor reality show of SSDs as that
was actually a really cool feature to
follow they did several updates on it
throughout the test period and
eventually wrote the conclusion of
course which you could check out but I
would recommend going through the whole
series because I actually kind of fun to
read and see which of these SSDs dies
off and how to say
degrade and performance how do they
start showing flaws and faults when do
the testers think that it's kind of
nearing an end of life for a particular
SSD I think they did a couple petabytes
of write and read read and write cycles
on one of them but I should say write
any race cycles programming race so that
would be where I'd go for that question
I I don't have the best answer but they
have a really cool content piece that I
wanted to highlight because there's
there's no point trying to compete with
that it's probably the best one out
there for endurance testing that was
done by a third-party media outlet next
question
bad dragon 5 says hey Steve I've always
wondered how a rain is rendered in
modern games like GTA 5 or battlefield 1
is it just green space like outside of
the players viewpoint it's only raining
in your guy's face or is it world space
like it's raining in the world if the
former has any game ever tried the
latter and what kind of impact on the
game might we see between the two if you
do something like world space it would
be a bigger impact this is something
that we want to look into for a separate
series actually so thank you for the
idea we'll be working on rain and
weather effects and games coming up but
the short of it is that no it's not
gonna be world space it's probably
rendered kind of in the frustum that
your your whatever your viewpoint is but
I don't have off top my head examples of
games where they've tried to do world
space specifically but we will look
around for the upcoming series so
subscribe for that as always or the last
two questions here ml North says you're
passing comment about radiators being
mounted with tubes at the bottom made my
one week old H 100 IV to pump absolutely
silent
whereas before on performance setting I
could hear noise why is this information
not more widely known or accepted I
don't know if you look around at a lot
of YouTube videos you'll see that very
frequently the youtubers mount with the
tubes at the top maybe doing a short
build whatever I guess doesn't matter a
whole lot but for best silence and
performance and endurance mostly silence
though yeah mount mount tubes at the
bottom I'm glad it helped you hopefully
some other folks will pick that up as
well does matter a little bit based on
manufacturer but in general that's kind
of the rule
tubes on the bottom because you want the
pressure to be forcing the water down
not with a big air gap above the tank
last question
greasy pommel says steve is the wooden
wall behind you real or is it a green
screen it is real we built that wall
maybe over a year ago now maybe two
years ago might be two years old at this
point
built it out of adhesive aged wood so
this is wood is real and very expensive
unfortunately it's like sticker wood so
we stuck it on and built a folding
wooden panel box so this is actually two
halves I think the split the splits may
be right here or it's right here
actually so if we were to pull this off
it just mounts onto the wall there's an
angled piece of wood at the top that
this sockets into so the wall itself is
not screwed into the wall its screwed
into sort of a mounting mechanism and
then that's got an angle in it so if a
cat claws on the thing that's not gonna
fall down and then the cool thing is we
can pull it off the wall and fold it so
it can fit through the door frames and
be moved if we move studios or something
so now it's actually real we have a
video on making it you can search the
channel I think for video set or GN set
another two videos on it and it's
progressed a lot since then so thanks
for all the questions as always if you
have more for next week post them in the
comments below and as kind of an aside a
side note I was on the awesome hardware
show with Paul and tile a couple days
ago they had some audio issues at the
beginning let's get the first three
minutes but after that it was pretty
good we had a good time that was at the
am the event which I can say now because
obviously we were all there for the
Rison thing and we'll have more news on
rising shortly so subscribe as always
