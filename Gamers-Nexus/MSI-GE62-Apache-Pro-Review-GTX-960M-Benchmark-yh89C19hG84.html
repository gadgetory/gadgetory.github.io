cinder blocks but going with smaller
form factors like this one does pose a
risk for thermals and that's one of the
things we're going to be looking at
today with Emma sized ge62 Apache pro
gaming laptop this is the 6 QD model of
those it's got an i7 6700 HQ @ a gtx
960m we've got all the specs on the
screen now this particular model is
$1,300 there's a 970m version of this
with slight changes to the storage
capacity and memory capacity for $1,500
first off check our full in-depth
article links in the description below
for more information on charts that
might not be here this benchmark looks
at gaming performance battery life
thermals and overall build quality of
the laptop we've recently done
overclocking with laptops actually with
the CyberPower fame book for running the
newest Intel unlocked laptop CPUs to
case cube for laptops we also reviewed
MSI's gt72 Dominator Pro G a stark
difference from this one and that had a
GTX 980 desktop GPU and it believe it or
not and that was an interesting test
because it was the first fully unlocked
desktop GPU in a laptop the Apache Pro
the one we're looking at today takes on
a more reasonable and genuinely portable
form factor running 15.6 inches for the
screen at 1080p with an IPS panel and a
total unit size of 15 by 10 point 2 4 by
1.1 4 inches the IPS panel affords
excellent viewing angles for a laptop
though use cases for that are generally
limited to times when you might have
more than one person looking at the
screen otherwise it's a fairly standard
1080p display with vibrant colors and
brightness the most overlooked aspect of
laptops and reviews is the ability to
effortlessly maintain the components
within the laptop and for our enthusiast
audience that's a pretty important
feature for the laptops just ease of
access because we're the type of people
the viewers and of course staff who
would rather fix the laptops problems
maybe add new thermal paste or whatever
then set it in for warranty repair or
buy a new laptop so one of the things
we're looking at here is that ease of
access with the back panel and component
accessibility to the user without having
to pull apart the entire
I see and keyboard and display and
everything like you do in a lot of
laptops removing the back panel of the
ge62
reveals an ideal layout everything's
there under one panel know if I've seen
with the keyboard and chassis to get
into secret compartments for RAM or GPU
access the gum stick SSD HDD Ram CPU GPU
and cooling fans are also all here under
one panel and if for some reason you had
to apply new thermal compound to the
laptops heat sinks it be less than
thirty minutes of work which of course
it's something that generally does have
to happen at some point with these long
service lives for the laptops speaking
as someone who's once held a job that
required 40 to 50 hours a week of laptop
testing and disassembling for thermal
analysis this one is about as good as it
gets the ge62 is it very easy to
disassemble put back together and access
all the core components the thermal
design is also pretty straightforward a
couple of large copper heat sinks meet
at alloy heat sinks that cover the GPU
and CPU so the copper heat pipes are
used for they've actually got liquid
inside of them as you may know from our
previous videos that liquid just moves
from one end to the other does a phase
change into gas at one point and that's
what does all the thermal conductivity
and dissipation from the silicon so
these terminate in standard cooling fans
at the ends with an alloy heatsink in
the center ventilation is present in the
front of the chassis as intake rears
exhaust and bottom for general
breathability and there are two axial
fans in the system at opposite corners
audio is a big thing for laptops too
it's one of those things that you can't
really fix once you've bought it so
personally speaking I've got an old ACS
B al series laptop and that has speakers
that are so bad I've basically got a
plug peripherals headset or speakers
into it in order to actually hear the
sound coming out of the system because
the speakers are that bad so it's always
important to us to look at how powerful
the audio is in a laptop when we're
reviewing it and with these newer ones
the trend and that's included with this
laptop there are actually subwoofers on
the bottom of these things so there is a
subwoofer right here you can see the
little speaker cover and that is
supposed to help with bass of course but
we'll see how it works in the real world
the patchy ge62 has a subwoofer in the
bottom and speakers on the top near the
display audio
is allowed but not necessarily powerful
for things like music the bass
despite MSI's use of a subwoofer is weak
and outperformed by the flat EQ of the
overall sound system everything sort of
emits the same volume level so highest
things like high hats will often drown
out mid tones for a laptop that we're
pretty happy with the raw noise output
overall before diving into benchmarks
I've got two core points of criticism
for this laptop software bloats a big
problem for the ge62 and it's sort of
disappointing because I haven't had
software bloat issues for years now most
of the sis or system integrators and
manufacturers like MSI have improved
with time I have really gone a long way
to remove the bloat in their preach
pre-built systems and laptops with the
ge62 it comes with one a really
obnoxious MSI warranty registration
program it basically just pops up and
tells you to register the warranty
constantly as really hard to get rid of
so that's one thing but then it's also
got the killer networking software which
I really frankly do not like at all so
it's got killer it's got the MSI
warranty thing it has an RGB LED control
for the keyboard which of course you
need otherwise why would you have the
RGB LED keyboard it's got controls for
the touchpad and all the gestures and
inputs and things like that separate
controls for more keyboard functions and
then some Intel software that is also
useless so there's a lot of stuff on
there oh and Norton how could I forget
Norton the plague upon PC gamers
everywhere because even though it is a
solid AV in some aspects especially
corporate it's really not necessary for
gamers and it does pretty massively slow
down boot times and things like that at
least with the version that's on here so
that is something I would rather not
have pre-installed and just sort of
leave it up to the user of do you want
to install something like ms e or Avast
or something lighter weight and this is
maybe something that laptop
manufacturers and sis could listen to
for the future I think maybe looking
into some sort of service like my
Knights or similar basically pops up
when they turn on the laptop and says
what things do you want they check it
and then it installs it that would be a
better solution if you want to enable
users who are maybe less savvy to get
the software but also not way everyone
down with garbage
that is the main complaint here is just
bloatware you can install uninstall at
all of course but why would you want to
do that if you're just trying to buy a
good gaming laptop out of the gate
there also were issues with the embedded
controller firmware and bios which have
the fans operating at low speeds that
allowed massive heat accumulation we
have the CPU running at 41 C delta T
over ambient idle again which is about
61 Celsius in our environments absolute
that is completely unacceptable and the
surface of the laptop the part that you
actually touch with your wrist is about
105 Fahrenheit under these conditions
definitely uncomfortable as a user
fortunately we were able to work with
MSI to resolve this problem with the EC
and BIOS updates and that's something we
explained in another video on the
channel that's already live let's look
at the gaming benchmarks and see how
this thing actually performs for video
games all of our test methodology and
system specs are detailed in the article
linked below or on gamers nexus net
battery life testing will also be
available in more depth on the site
thermals first the ge62 had severe
issues when we first got it thermally so
these results were collected after
fixing the EC and BIOS with those
updates thermal results are on screen
we've currently changed and updated our
testing methodology so all these laptops
on the chart have been rechecked and
updated as necessary it's not fully
comparable to our previous tests because
of methodology changes after the EC and
BIOS flash the ge62 Apache performs
reasonably well out 34.5 C delta T over
ambient for the GPU and 28.1 C delta T
for the CPU both are definitely
accessible temperatures and generally
cooler than most the other laptops we've
tested the PC H runs a bit warm at
roughly 35 Celsius delta T but is still
acceptable before updates our
temperatures were nearing about 60
Celsius delta T when under load for just
the CPU so that is quite a hike and it's
a worth while EC and BIOS update if you
end up buying one of these the GE 62
runs pretty cool post update given its
portable form factor and rough 1 inch
thickness here's a quick look at the
battery life chart for our laptop so we
run grid Autosport
non-stop using the high-performance
windows profile no AC adapter connected
of course to
this time and we check the event log for
the inevitable shutdown and then
extrapolate a time in that fashion most
gaming laptops lasts between 45 minutes
and a little over an hour depending on
how powerful the GPU component is and
how hot the CPU runs time for gaming
stuff competitively the gtx 960m is
obviously significantly underpowered
versus the 970 m and 980 units on this
bench it's also a $1,300 laptop so that
makes it much more affordable than the
other stuff we've reviewed which tends
to be in the 2,000 to 3,000 dollar range
nothing's really all that playable at
Ultra settings with 1080p resolution on
the 960m GTA 5 is the first example
where we see about 33 FPS average and
the lows are actually times pretty
tightly so that is a good thing despite
the low averages overall unfortunately
that low overall average does mean it's
too low to properly enjoy the game at
these settings and the 970m is much more
reasonable especially when overclocked
but the 980m is where you'd have to be
for 60fps if that matters to you with
dirt rally we saw about 32 FPS average
with tightly time to lows on the 960m
the 970m laptop is a huge step up
running almost 60 FPS average and is
totally playable on ultra shadow of
mordor pushes the ge62 Apache Pro beyond
its limits as it falls below 30 FPS
hitting just 29 FPS average the same is
true for Metro last light generally a
gtx 970m gets you a fairly playable
framerate at Ultra with tweaks anyway on
all of these games but it's not until
the witcher 3 that everything that
suffers on ultra and that's fair since
the game is so intensive here's a quick
chart showing medium settings on only
the 960m as you can see here it's
suddenly significantly more playable on
all of these titles we're hitting 50
plus FPS in a lot of cases and that's
just fine for a $1,300 laptop if you're
on a budget and a bit over a grand is
your sort of target to spend and you're
willing to sacrifice down to medium
settings then the ge62 does have good
performance
the ge62 is the kind of laptop you would
be buying if you travel a lot or haul it
back and forth on a day to day basis
maybe to school or work and that is
something that it's good at it's
generally small it's got a 960 M which
is powerful enough but not so powerful
forces the laptop into a larger chassis
sort of format and the GTX 980 and 970
laptops that are above this one are 970
m and 980 m laptops do definitely have a
lot more output in terms of power or
performance you're able to hit those 50
fps sort of averages at a minimum with
most of these games or at least
something like 48 so that does make them
a lot more playable on ultra if you're
willing to drop down to something like
medium and you're on a budget of around
$1,300 then this is actually good laptop
for those things the really only key
points that we had about the labs that
were bad we're the bloatware so that's
one thing but you can fix that by
sitting there and uninstalling stuff for
half an hour and the other point was the
high thermals stock and that's resolved
with an EC and a BIOS update assuming
MSI doesn't just start shipping the
laptops with those things pre-installed
the next thing here this does have a
970m cousin it's the same laptop with a
970m in it slightly different storage
spec but pretty similar overall and that
is $200 more that's $1500 and for the
$200 price jump it really it sort of is
worth it if you are the type of person
who just can't stand looking at medium
settings now 1080 medium with these
games even though we always talk about
ultra it still looks pretty damn good
especially for the price but if you
really need high or maybe pushing the
ultra settings in some cases obviously
you got to be connected to AC when
you're doing that then the $200 would be
worthwhile so that's the ge62 6qd
