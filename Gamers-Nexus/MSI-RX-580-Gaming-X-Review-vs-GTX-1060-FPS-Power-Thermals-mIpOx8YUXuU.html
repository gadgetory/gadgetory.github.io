Gatling gun the last month or so and
their latest round includes the
ammunition in the GPU Department the
Polaris lines heated second deployment
in the rx 500 GPUs including the 580 and
570 that launch today
these are refinements over the initial
Polaris launched by architecture remains
entirely unchanged the rx 500 series
ships with tire stock clocks from the
400 cards effectively serving as a pre
overclock with some additional OC
headroom on top of that this includes an
extra 25 millivolts over voltage that
board partners can opt into like a
messiah has done for the rx 580 gaming X
that we're reviewing today we'll post
our rx 570 review tomorrow before that
this coverage is brought to you by the
Computex conference which runs from May
30th to June 3rd in Taipei Taiwan this
year Computex is the biggest event of
the year for PC hardware and technology
where we preview the newest prototypes
before they come to market
we highly recommend attending or
following this event online for industry
professionals and enthusiasts learn more
at the link in the description below as
stated our rx 570 review goes live
tomorrow we also have the XFX 580 that
we'll be looking at shortly this week
sometime this one's pretty cool actually
for a few reasons but we'll get to that
soon enough first thing to do here
though is to clear up some
misconceptions and confusion that we saw
online pertaining to the rx 500 launch
there were some photos going out or
slides that showed what looked like a
new reference cooler it doesn't exist
that's not a thing so the slides that
were going around we saw them Scott
Watson came by and did some videos with
us and he presented us a slideshow at
that time it included the slide that you
all likely saw and many people were
speculating consisted of plans for a new
reference cooler that was not a blower
cooler in fact that was just a slide
saying that this is going to be a
partner launch so what does that mean
that means that people like MSI XFX
gigabyte the AIB partners basically
dictate everything within reason on the
polaris refresh more or less so these
cards the 580 s our partner only models
there is no reference rx 580 there will
be no reference rx 570 as far as
are we're currently and that means that
the coolers reference coolers don't
exist in the capacity that was being
rumored on the internet so this is what
you get you get the AIB partner coolers
and that's it that means that we'll be
testing these individually and doing
reviews individually of the cards as
they come out rather than just a blanket
580 review using the reference model
with updates later the clocks will be
dictated by the partners this time
around so overall what we're seeing is
basically a pre OC on something like an
Rx for a tea the frequency out of the
box for these cards versus the previous
cards is higher than both the reference
and most of the partner models for the
MSI card that we have it's got the Twin
Frozr cooler that you see pretty much on
all of their cards at this point the
stock clock out of box is about 1367
megahertz peak so it tends to average
around 13 40 1350 somewhere in there and
then if you maxed out the power slider
without touching anything else to 150%
of power that gets us up to 13 93
megahertz fixed just constant so we're
looking at it just under 1,400 megahertz
for out-of-box performance when the
power target is maxed and then for
overclocking things of note would be the
extra 25 millivolts that we can get at
least on this card AMD permits it it is
up to the board partners to actually
leverage that so in watt man the utility
this one will go up to 1200 millivolts
in reality that translates to about one
point two six or one point two five six
volts and stock without the power target
offset at some around one point to two
volts so you have some room there to
play with overclocking we'll get into
our OC stepping charts in a minute and
the rest of the 580 series in terms of
clocks is going to be more or less
around the 1360 mark 213 90 mark without
any over clocks by the user other than
that there aren't any real differences
to speak of here it still Polaris 10
it's more refined and mature as a
process but the gains are entirely from
increases in clock rate and idle power
management granted load power is still
higher than the our X 480 because the
clock is higher as for prices the
cheapest rx 588 gigabyte card will be
two hundred and twenty dollars and that
is an
our X 580 gaming made by gigabyte there
are 4 gigabytes as an 4gb not the brand
4 GB models nearing the $190 mark and
then there are a couple of the RX 570
models around 170 to 180 for price our
review today will be looking at one of
the better rx 580 is the gaming X priced
at $245 and then our XFX model that
we're reviewing later this week is about
$250 for our primary comparison we're
looking at a GTX 960 SSC this is an EVGA
card priced at 250 so it's a pretty
head-to-head match with the gaming X 245
250 then there you have some kind of
deal it's basically the same price we
also in maybe two of the charts have at
some data from the gaming x10 60 model
that one tends to be bit more expensive
clocked a bit higher its gaming actually
gaming X so we left it in for those
charts and that's really it so there's
no big architecture discussion here like
we normally have with a new video card
launch if you are curious about the
Polaris architecture watch our initial
our X 480 review or read the article
because it's the same nothing has
changed no point in rehashing all that
the content was already refined and good
when we put it out there and there's no
changes so this is a refresh there are
faster clocks that means we can expect
an increase in benchmark performance and
let's start off with power before
getting into the power stuff we do have
an OCD stepping chart to clarify what
the clocks were when we went into the
power testing and game testing put that
on the screen now that shows the process
of failure and success on different
clocks for the 580 gaming X specifically
if you want to see the other numbers you
can go to the article and then for the
rest of the testing methodology again
article links in the description below
will contain all of that so we've got
the thermal testing there we have the
outline for power testing gaming
benchmarks all that stuff to find in the
article power has a direct correlation
with thermals and so it's important to
establish a baseline power measurement
in some real use cases our power testing
is done at the wall which means that
this is a measurement of total system
power draw not individual GPU draw by
the rails and that means we
firstly care about the card to card
Delta's for power test we're using two
games configure two very high or extreme
graphics settings 3dmark fire strike
extreme and idle for desktop draw idle
the RX 580 gaming next system consumes
about 76 to watch which is a reduction
of a few watts from the RS 40 stock
configuration this is expected and these
tuning on it's 40 nanometer process has
brought down power consumption
specifically when idle and when viewing
things like movies or other low load GPU
tasks the RX 580 system draws about 8.6
percent more power idle than the 70
watts 1060 system moving on the 3d mark
fire strike we see that the synthetic
benchmark post the RX 580 gaming Xbox
system at 281 watch with the overclocked
experience at one point two six volts
now drawing 301 watts for an increase in
power consumption of seven percent the
RX for 80 gaming X system draws 248
watts with its overclocked counterpart
at 270 watts when running eight 1375 ish
megahertz on the core the RX 580 gaming
ex consumes approximately 13% more power
than the our X 480 gaming X when both
are stock that's obviously not true for
idle different story there the EVGA gtx
1060 SSC runs the same workload with a
total system draw in 3d mark of 202
watts stock or 219 overclocked the RX
580 consumes approximately 39% more
power than the GTX 960 SSC for honor is
one of our more load intensive games at
landing the 580 systems at 310 watt
stock or 334 Watts overclocked for an
increase in power consumption of about
12% over the RX 480
the 1060 SSE runs around 218 watt stock
and 234 OC resulting in the RX 580
consuming about 42% more power when both
our stock Ghost Recon in so it shows
more of the same we've got that on the
chart as well if you want to see how
that game consumes power it's a bit
different from for honor but the scaling
is more or less linear we're going to
get straight into game testing now if
you want to see the other charts for
things like frequency overtime and
temperatures you can check the content
below let's start off with Mass Effect
Andromeda at 1080p the RX 580 gaming ex
stock card run
in average frame rate of about 79 FPS
with 1% loaded at 62 and 0.1% loads at
57 frame tennis here are relatively
consistent and in line with other
results versus the stock are X 480
gaming X this is an improvement of about
5.4 percent stock to stock or about 6.8%
when looking at the overclocked 580
versus the overclocked 480 and
overclocked 580 is basically then
overclocked overclocked 480 it's it's
the same architecture the frequency is
the only difference here the overclocked
rx 580 outperforms the fury X in this
particular test and performs about 2.4
percent behind the gtx 970 or about 7%
behind the gtx 960 SSC which operates
frame rates of 89 68 and 64 overclocking
the 1060 SSE gets at 295 FPS average
just ahead of the 1060 gaming x from msi
overclock to RX 580 performs about 13%
behind at the gtx 960 SSC would be stock
rx 580 performing about 11% behind the
stock gtx 960 SSC strictly for point of
reference the RX 470 runs at around 63
FPS in this test the r9 390x at about 70
and the gtx 1070 SC at about 119 FPS
will have 570 numbers for you shortly
here's a look at the stock clock frame
times of the rx 580 versus the gtx 960
SSC just to help give an idea of latency
between frames but moving on swiftly to
1440p the RX 580 gaming x stock is now
running at 51 FPS average with the same
inconsistent frame times as most the
other results of the stack the stock rx
580 is evenly matched with our
overclocked to 480 gaming X or about 4%
ahead of the stock our X 480 the RX 580
OC operates about 5.2 percent faster
than the stock version now at 54 FPS
average which leaves the 580 cards
flanking the 970 looking to the direct
competitors in the gtx 1060 class the
SOC stock runs at 57 FPS average putting
at about 16% ahead of the stock rx 580
with the overclocked SSE card running
about 13.6% ahead of the overclocked rx
580 card just for perspective we'll
quickly highlight the r9 390
the r9 fury acts and the gtx 1070 cards
on the chart to give an idea of where
things fall Pentagon - Ghost Recon
wildlands and then we'll get to doom
with Vulcan at 1080p the rx 580 gaming X
lens at 58 FPS average roughly the same
as the RX for 80 game NEX with just some
difference in the frame times as for the
gtx 960 SSC the pascal card lands at 67
FPS average stock marking it in a lead
of about 15.5% overclocked in the 1060
SSE gives it some trouble in the point
one percent department but we see a
boost to 72 FPS average and the 580
gaming X moves to 61 FPS average moving
on to 1440p the RX 580 gaming X runs
around 46 FPS average with the GTX 1060
at 48 fps average and increasing the
resolution has shrunk in the gap between
the two devices with the tanzic the SSE
primarily pulling away when overclocking
moving now to doom at 4k the RX 580
gaming X lands at around 44 FPS average
alongside the R X 480 gaming X just
behind the 980 TI and just ahead of the
gtx 960 SSC the RX 580 stock leads the
EVGA 1060 SOC stock by about 8.3 percent
with the overclocked SSC showing some
stability issues in its frame time
consistency the rx 580 overclocked gets
up to 50 fps and improvement over the
stock 580 of about eleven point seven
percent let's move on to a more
realistic resolution of 1440 P the rx
580 game next card runs around 91 FPS
average again posting an uninteresting
1.5% climb from the Rx for a DS position
the 580 stock outperforms of the 1060
SSC by about 12% with the 1060 SSE
running at 81 FPS average and with
similar frame times and lows to the 580
game next overclocking the SSC gets it
to 87 FPS average while the overclocked
rx 580 gaming X it's about 100 FPS
average at 1440p the 580 OC leads the
1060 OC by about 15% here I'm looking
now at 1080p the RX 580 gaming X runs at
140 FPS average with 1% low at 106 and
0.1% at 104 the 1060 SSE stock runs on
23 average with lows at 92 and 90's the
RX 580 stock and a lead of about
fourteen point three percent with the
overclocked 580 leading the overclock as
a C by about fourteen point four percent
playing for honor at 1080p with extreme
settings the RX 580 game in Ex places
around 93 FPS average with frame times
tightly timed the GTX 960 SSC performed
similarly running an average FPS of 94
with lows at 83 and 77 to the 580 77 and
73 overclocked into this game always it
goes over poorly unless we really
minimize the OSI to get anything stable
or resembling stable on the gtx 980ti or
as card for example we have to set the
offset to just 20 megahertz not that
impressive
ignore the overclocked numbers here as
the game is unplayable and abnormally
sensitive to overclock we're only
putting them here in this first chart so
that it's understood so that you can see
both the 1050 and 580 are basically
unplayable with their respective
overseas i'm leslie really really drop
them down to near stock back to the
focus of the chart the 580 gaming acts
without performed by the 1060 SSE by
about 1.7 percent with the 580 game
index running about 8 percent faster
than the 480 Gaming Act at 1440p the RX
580 gaming ex runs a frame rate of about
60 FPS average making it 4.7 percent
faster than the RX for use 57 FPS
average the GTX 1060 SOC operates at 61
FPS average leading the 580 by about 2.1
percent
nothing significant or exciting between
either device they are both good
performers when operating at stock
frequencies and for honor and they are
imperceptibly different Sniper Elite is
our final game for the video version of
this review we only currently have 40
numbers for this one but it does give a
good look at an intensive dx12 scenario
the RX 580 gaming X runs at 40 FPS
average here with the overclocked
experience at 44 average that puts the
580 GX about 13 to 14 percent ahead of
the 1060 SFC but with our overclocked
and stock for that number 13 to 14
percent applies in each case we're
trading blows between titles it appears
and the synthetics in the form of 3d
mark ashes to some extent and other
tests can be found linked in the article
below
this isn't really a deep review because
it's not a new architecture so it's a
bit weird this is a mid
cycle refresh between now and Vega and
aims to pull the 400 series off the
shelves and replace it with 500 series
cards that are roughly the same price or
slightly less in some cases so that's a
good thing overall it's just the launch
from what we've seen thus far is kind of
met there's something really special
about it but it's not bad either if you
just bought an Rx for 80 for example and
you're feeling a bit salty take solace
in the fact that overall we're looking
at percent gains of about 5% if you kind
of average all the titles together
sometimes it's a little more but
overclocking the 480 basically gets you
to a stock 580 in at least some of the
games we've tested though you can see it
in the synthetics as well in the article
so overall it's a couple percent gain
over the 480 not bad it's just it's not
Vega and of course people have been
waiting for that for a long time so it's
not going to nothing will excite people
in the GPU department until vehicle
launches I think it's fair to say for
the most part so this is not targeted at
people who already have systems built
and who don't need something unless it's
a major launch this is not an upgrade it
is a new GPU purchase if you haven't
built a system for a while and you're
looking for something that would be a
480 but now those are basically going to
be killed and replaces the 5 Hades
that's what we're looking at in terms of
the 1060 versus the 580 debate the best
thing I can say is look at the numbers
and figure out what matches for the
games that you play because they do
trade in a couple of titles the x11
titles the 1060 tends to be a bit ahead
that's really not news for NVIDIA the
Vulcan title doom being the seminal
example allows the 580 to lead the 1060
by a good bit and then in some of the
extra 12 titles we see trading so images
of the singularity they're roughly the
same in Sniper Elite and D tends to lead
by a bit at least over the 1060 SOC from
EVGA so that's what looking at power is
another big thing to look at if that's
something you care about the 1060 is
quite a bit more power efficient if you
don't care at all about it then whatever
I guess the testing was for nothing but
if you care about power which you should
because it correlates directly with
other thing
like Heath check the numbers see if they
match with your build budget and things
like that and your needs in terms of
ambient heat output and all that stuff
so this is a scenario with 1062 580 past
the trophy back and forth there's
nothing exciting here to say for that I
apologize I suppose but it's not a bad
launch it's just not exciting you can
learn more at the link in the
description below for the article which
has some additional testing and other
than that thank you for watching you can
subscribe for more as always check us
out in other videos coming out this week
including the review of this card which
is a 570 this one I'm a bit more
interested in from a market stack
standpoint
thank you for watching I'll see you all
