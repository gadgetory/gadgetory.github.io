component to test and it's not because
of the work that goes into it it's
because of all of the insanity that
follows with comments and things on the
internet and it's not just our
benchmarks this is normal discourse when
talking out and en nvidia and i think
it's time to at least put some ideas out
there with regard to how humans can
better communicate with one another so
it means for this to be patronizing but
seriously our platform is not something
that i want to be used to bash people
and abuse them over which video card for
playing video games they would prefer to
buy that's insane and i mean just you
look at the language used things like of
well inflammatory things that i won't
repeat two things that are just kind of
stupid like the word Nvidia or AMD
fanboy things like that and it's said
with such hatred that it blows my mind
so this video is more of a kind of
almost off-topic semi rant semi public
service announcement I guess that I just
needed to put out there because I it
drives me crazy to see how people
interact with one another and this isn't
just talking about how commenters
interact with the producers of the
content that's that's fine I mean
obviously we've got our limits too I
don't necessarily like reading some of
the hateful comments but I put myself in
that position so I'm not going to rant
about it what I will rant about is how
people interact with one another in our
comments from the comments of other
videos Jay recently kind of put out a
video talking about this to some extent
and I agree with him on a few points
there but the idea that buying a video
card suddenly puts you into this
exclusive club and that you then have to
defend that purchase vehemently by
spewing vitriol at everyone who bought
something else doesn't make any sense
and it's not normal and it's not healthy
you know ultimately why even defend to
companies that they're both corporations
and
Intel if you want to throw them and but
they're really kind of different topic
they just want your money and that's not
necessarily an evil thing they both want
the same thing AMD Nvidia both want you
to buy their product defending them just
seems silly I just look at this
like we have comments I can just search
we have a tool in YouTube this is one
thing that YouTube does that's semi
useful there's a tool where you can
search all comments for all videos that
we've produced the word Nvidia for
example there's this person saying why
do people think Andy's next card will
outperform a 1080 it will probably fail
to match 1070 to be honest okay I don't
know that I necessarily necessarily
agree with the premise
we'll see how it performs that's not the
point of this video we're not talking
about Vega but it's a reasonable thing
to say it's not really that that
aggressive or hateful you look at the
comments though the first one typical
nvidia has nothing to do this video keep
giving your corporate overlords and
video all your hard-earned dollars so
they can f you over by not giving a
about your GP two years later i don't
know why that's my that's my designation
for what's acceptable to say but reply
and video that's funny considering i
have two RX four 80s and it goes on and
that's what i'm talking about it's just
this isn't how you talk to people it's
not okay for just this one point talking
out corporate overlords giving them all
their money or the one we hear all the
time which is chill or whatever i the
just because you don't necessarily agree
with the content doesn't mean or even
agree with the other users commenting on
the content doesn't mean that that user
was paid off and is being paid to
comment on youtube videos a specific
thing for just just to kind of point
this out we spend a lot of time talking
about architecture and videos and i can
talk about clock gating and heuristic
prefetch service circuits and all of
these different routines in the video
car the memory subsystem the compression
algorithms that are used to make things
faster we can talk about
the SM layout and how there's precision
switching capability is on a particular
GPU and why that might be useful for one
application or another and why you would
switch to something like FP 16 for deep
learning at FP 32 for gaming whatever FP
64 all that stuff we can talk about
architecture all day talk about it for
sometimes 10 minutes and some of these
major GPU reviews but it doesn't matter
people don't really they jump either to
the benchmarks or they go to the
comments and this is the bigger problem
maybe this is a different video but all
of that's ignored and it's just
immediately this number doesn't match
what I thought it should be based on
nothing or very limited experience and
therefore it is wrong or it is paid for
or it is somehow attacking me personally
and my decision to buy the other product
and this isn't just about Nvidia but
it's about Nvidia and AMD happens on
both sides and video is just the one I
pulled up here because the phrase Nvidia
is kind of so stupid and specific that
it's really easy to search for and the
thing that's really vexing to me is that
this is something we don't see for other
components it's almost entirely AMD and
NVIDIA and there's a bit of it when
talking about CPUs but it does seem kind
of less extreme but on GPUs this is way
over the top I could talk all day about
this NZXT case I could talk crap about
the rubber puck people well now so well
that people in the comments would
normally not go and then cry about what
has been said about the puck and say
that I'm a corsair fanboy or something
or a fan tax fanboy or a shill for
whomever it doesn't happen with those
components so why does it happen with
GPUs that's what I've been thinking
about lately I'm not sure I have an
answer for that I think some of it is
there's only two real GPU vendors and
sure Intel whatever they have there IGP
we all know that doesn't count it's it's
a fine effort by Intel it does its tasks
but that's not really what this is about
so why why am the nvidia well I guess
there's only two vendors and
so much marketing behind each of them
and these got their and the Red Team
Plus which I guess is kind of like a fan
club type of thing the equivalent of a
fan club for a band and Vidya has plenty
of their own marketing and I think
people just get a little too into it and
I don't know how much of it is your as a
consumer you've maybe spent $600 on a
video card so you don't want to feel bad
about that money spent you don't want to
feel like you've spent it in the wrong
place maybe that's some of it but even
that I don't know I mean for the most
part the the GPU is underlying the card
even if there might be better value from
one vendor and maybe you have some
buyer's remorse that you spent $100 more
than was necessary or whatever even
though there might be better value
somewhere else that doesn't mean that
the one you bought is bad enough to feel
assaulted and if if that is the case
it's probably better to direct that in
the form of a return or an RMA with the
company that you think has so screwed
you and unfortunately normally this is
not the one that was bought it's the
other one it's somehow the other company
is is hurting me or the buyers of the
other company's products are attacking
me and I purchases this obviously isn't
everyone we have a pretty generally
great community it's smaller I think
which certainly helps a lot I've noticed
that when videos blow up more they do
get a lot more comments that I would
like to stay elsewhere on other channels
not ours we've worked pretty hard to
build ours up into a more mature
community that's more data driven so
when the videos blow up a bit yeah they
get some comments that are that are kind
of dumb but it's obviously not everyone
it's not the regulars it's just
something that's all over the internet
and this isn't just GN and our channel
and our website you go anywhere on
reddit and the gaming PC gaming PC
master-race
build a PC any of those sub reddits
there's so much of this and it's it's
bad I think if you're making an argument
to buy one card versus another than back
get up with something and unfortunately
when people try to do that it's
generally very misguided so for example
the one we see a lot is how come when I
test this card using who the hell knows
what tools and who knows what
methodology it performs better or worse
than your results well that's probably
why there's a few reasons right there's
first of all not all cards perform
equally so we test a reference card or
an AIB partner card those could have a
big difference or they could not it
depends on the game and then methodology
I think a lot of people don't even
realize if you jump into GTA 5 and you
play the game and let's say near out in
a field near a bunch of grass I know
from testing firsthand hundreds of hours
in this game testing it I know that if
you're in that turret terrain you will
have a lower frame rate than what we see
why is that well it's because you're
near a bunch of grass and if you have
grass on ultra it's going to hammer the
card in a way that our testing doesn't
necessarily do it we have a more mixed
layout for for benchmarking and that's
not to say one is wrong or right but
it's to say that they need to be the
same so this idea that all benchmarks
are equal is misguided and if if you're
going to try and validate claims at
least read the test methodology sections
and understand what's going on because
there's stuff in here that I think
people don't even realize could be
different right it's really basic stuff
for us having done it for eight going on
nine years now I've been doing this in
2008 I have a pretty good methodology at
this point I and there's a lot of stuff
you can overlook and I've done it and
I've had to retest for probably dozens
of hours in the past because of
something that was overlooked it's
really easy to overlook something so for
example a ist is that on or off it could
be behaving differently between your
test passes see states are they on or
off that's just BIOS level stuff and
then you have Windows stuff with all the
different power saving features with
software that could be running the
background doing one thing or another
that's still the easy stuff then you get
into the benchmarking tools like fraps
or present Mon or Oh cat or dxtory or
whatever not an FPS fps does not equal
fps it's not a universal metric it's not
like meters or feet or whatever where we
have a defined thing FPS could be read
in few different ways and I've talked
about this before but you have things
like just on present versus display do
the people talking and sort of bickering
with one another even understand what
those things mean or that they exist and
we've explained them in the past and
it's okay to not know that that's
something to know about and that your
particular software solution may be
different than someone else's whomever
you're arguing with on reddit or
wherever it is put that as an example
because that's where people argue so
there's a lot to take into account and
this is sort of just a tangent off of
the rest of it to say that if trying to
make an argument using numbers
understand those numbers and where they
came from if you this is where a lot of
the time on videos from other content
creators even are videos of course or
articles or PC perspectives articles
tech reports articles and non text
articles everywhere I always see
comments that are like hey why are your
results different from this other
website it doesn't mean that one's wrong
necessarily it just means that and
someone could be wrong certainly but it
normally it means that the testing was
different so they could have used a
different variable when they were
measuring their frames or frame times
they could have used different software
or they could have just tested in a
different part of the game because that
really impacts things and then there's
the whole other question of cards and
which ones you use you we can post a
chart with reference cards and with
aftermarket cards and if I posted all of
them it would be so long it wouldn't fit
in the video and we do post normally
some slightly more in-depth ones on the
site but there's a lot of video cards
and it's not reasonable to test all of
them
so what do we do well sometimes we want
to put reference in there for a point of
reference and sometimes we want to put
the board partner cards in there but
it's not possible to make everyone happy
obviously because no matter what we do
if I pull one card out of the chart to
make space because you can only
reasonably fit so many on this screen
someone's going to complain that why
didn't you test this card there's a
there's a conspiracy and you're trying
to paint the vendor in a bad light or
something like that that's not no one's
out to get you
that's not how this works so it's era
there's just a lot of really poorly
thought-out things that are specific to
AMD and NVIDIA and I've been trying to
understand it for a long time I don't I
don't I don't know why it's like that
but I mean you just like you can look
through the comments and it's just
stupid let's take that and video you
know at all of this all these different
claims let's see let's find another one
like this so this not to call out this
user but this is what I was just talking
about how are you getting lower FPS than
my four seventy at 1080p with a 480 in
Doom what well i we probably tested a
different way most likely or had
different settings there's a lot of
settings and we define those as best we
can but it's not just stuff that I mean
this whole thread you know interact with
the user I think we kind of kind of
resolved in straightaway but that didn't
to stop the whole I don't just all the
slime from coming out and arguing with
each other over something so so petty
here's an example of a thread that
wasn't even related to us it was just a
good comment that makes sense in my
opinion average framerate doesn't matter
if a game stutters a lot I I would agree
with that that's a good way to start so
we're we're off to a good start here but
how quickly does it turn for the worst
it devolves into where we've got Andy's
current GNC sick architecture has high
latency it has to do with how it uses a
sing
to switch tasks that affects point one
percent lows a lot I don't really I
don't really know where that information
came from but you know it starts there
with maybe someone who kind of thinks
they know what they're talking about
fine whatever it wasn't it wasn't rude
it was just misinformed or you might
have some merit to it but I don't know
that I don't know that that's really
enough depth to make any conclusions
like we're being made and it just
evolves into wait for it you're still at
your Nvidia shield crap ice ice env
tards chills are riled up Lowell Lowell
no one believes your crap anymore what
is the point of this more posting by
Nvidia shell and I'm just I don't know I
I don't just because someone is either
it does matter if they're right or wrong
just because they aren't necessarily
agreeing with what someone else is
saying doesn't mean that they're paid
for and that's not even the worst of it
I mean just that sort of hatred and
stupidity that spawns out of people
owning one GPU or another is insane so I
don't really know I don't have a I don't
have a whole huge point to this other
than stop which is obviously not fit to
it me so uh why do we make the video I
guess just because I've been looking at
these comments for eight years and I'm
really curious about why is this with
nvidia and AMD specifically and if
you're a regular viewer just please
don't get sucked into that just see a
comment like that ignore it Eddie that's
it's the sad thing with YouTube and with
Reddit we're being contrary and means
that it is immediately at the top
doesn't matter if it's liked or not I
guess you could sort reddit depending
based on on up but YouTube though I
don't know who the hell knows what their
algorithm ties but it changes if you're
logged in or not so I don't know but uh
just just disagree and get something to
the top and it's not necessarily
something that makes sense all the time
most the time it's not even it may have
started out as a good
point but I it just turns into such
trash so I don't know if you're part of
our normal viewership community readers
I already generally trust that you're
not doing this type of thing but we
can't stop it obviously it's just it's
it's very frustrating to see that this
is the behavior with GPUs one of the
most complex parts and a PC and the
people who bicker like this don't even
understand the first part of it because
if you did or if they did there'd be a
much different discussion hopefully more
measured and thought-out and with actual
things to talk about not using words
like chill idiot all kinds of things
that I don't want to say right now it's
it's the wrong approach so ah I guess
that's it I don't know if you want to
see more videos that are not like this
you can subscribe to our channel for
benchmarks and scroll down to the
comment sections and then you can get
more things like this but it's not too
bad on our channel to be honest gamers
access not a net for more information
for written articles full depth all the
testing methodology we have thousands of
words on the games that are on the test
bench feel free to to educate yourself
on on the different graphics settings on
how the architecture interacts with it
things like that hopefully without
feeling like somehow one GPU vendor or
another is out to get you or us or
commentaries or whatever but yeah thanks
for watching I'll see you all next time
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
