same lesson as the r7 1700 CPU did about
its counterpart buying the cheaper unit
in the series and applying a quick
overclock instantly saved significantly
on cost and those so while offering
boasted performance with minimal effort
today we're reviewing the AMD rs3 1200
CPU for power gaming performance and
production performance with points of
notes from the r3 1300 X G 45 60 r5 CPUs
and more before that this is brought to
you by EVGA s at CLC 280 liquid cooler
for CPUs which we previously benchmarked
and found to be a high performer given
its relative silence the temperature
output learn more about this $140 cooler
at the link in the description below the
r3 1200 CPU is the other one in the line
of a and these are three products the
1200 1300 X and that's it for the r3 s
beyond that the 1500 1600 600 X and 1400
are a bit unique in the rise in lineup
in that they have different core and
thread counts depending on which one
you're looking at
so the 1200 and 1300 X are more similar
to the r7 series where you have the same
core specs 8 cores 16 threads for
everything and all that really changes
is the frequency out of the box and then
after that point you can basically just
rely on overclocking to get as close as
possible to the higher-end SKUs if not
beyond them depending on how lucky you
get with the CPU buy so the 1200 mirrors
that experience of the r7 s where the
1300 X makes a whole lot less sense if
you're willing to overclock not
everyone's willing to overclock of
course and so there's reason for the
1300 to exist it just for our audience
we really would encourage the extra
couple minutes to OC something and then
spend 20 less bucks in this case but we
need to test it to see how it does
before even talking about overclocking
and that value add from the OC so the
1200 is a $110 skew 1300 X $130 SKU and
then after that point you start getting
into the r5 series where we previously
recommended the r5 1600 X in our editors
choice lineup as the best CPU in that
price category meaning we would
recommend it over the i-5 the low-end is
still
kind of held by the G 4564 an ultra
cheap very budget oriented option and in
our TV bottlenecks housing on that CB we
found it scales quite well up to a GTX
1060 or rx 580 type of GPU but now in
the middle of the pack we're looking at
our 3s the 1,200 shifts 4 cores 4
threads 2.1 gigahertz base and 3.4
gigahertz boost and then beyond that we
really just need to test it to see how
it does so we're starting with gaming
for this one moving into blender and
premiere testing next following up with
power testing on the conclusion as
always click the link in the description
below for the full article which
contains all the testing methods and
extra charts that won't be present in
this video including extra synthetic
workloads you can find all that in the
full article on gamers necklace dotnet
starting with total war Warhammer with
high settings the r3 1200 CPU performs
at 109 FPS average is 1% lows at 65
point eight and jo-ann's on glows at 59
fps this pie is the r3 1200 was the
night unattainable but highly desirable
penny mg 45 60 which may as well be a
processor of myth at this point given
its unattainable status however this has
gotten a bit better in the recent days
the G 4600 is that leaves more available
than the 45 60 has been the 45 60 though
runs at roughly the same frame rate
across the board is the numbers that
were entered prior to the latest Total
War updates so you can expect a slight
uptick in performance regardless this
gives us an accurate depiction of how
both CPUs perform relative to one
another
unlike the G 45 60 however the 1200
overclocks with a 3.9 gigahertz OC we
jump to 127 FPS average on the r3 1200
for an improvement of 15.7% over the
stock 1200 CPU this also puts us pretty
damn close to the 1300 X when it was
over to 4.1 gigahertz at 129 FPS average
and that difference ultimately comes
down to frequency they're both three
point nine or four point one it would be
identical in performance our 1200 got
stuck at 3.9 gigahertz but just like the
our 70 P is equal clocks would provide
equal performance here this makes the r3
1200 a much better value for anyone
willing to overclock as you save $20
right away and can achieve the same
performance once clocked higher the
Intel i3 7300 C
view is still sold for around $150
though we've heard rumors of drops
lately and so it's a poor value compared
to the $110 r3 1200 overclocked CPU
which performs effectively identically
at 3.9 gigahertz and $40 cheaper for an
overclock on a $110 part that's good
performance and it's just interesting
that it happens to eat away at AMD's own
line up the r3 1300 ex making the 1200 a
much more exciting launch than 1300 ex
was in battlefield 1 the 1200 stock CPU
performs about 8.4 percent slower than
the 1300 X on both our stock at 101 FPS
average versus 110 FPS average but
overclocking again serves as a great
equalizer of AMD parts the 1200
overclock the 2.9 gigahertz runs an
average FPS of 1 15.5 effectively
identical to the average FPS of the 1300
X which is 116 at 4.1 gigahertz for
comparison our D 45 60 operates between
the stock and overclocked
are three 1200 entries at 112 FPS
average with the r5 CPUs performing
markedly better at 126 average minimally
or 136 average for the overclocked 1600
X that previously won our editors choice
award in watchdogs to the and the r3
1200 stock C Huber forms around where
the overclocked phenom 2 X 610 on ET
does and behind the r3 1300 x stock by
about 9% overclocking the r3 1200 boost
us to 53 FPS average placing the 1200 OC
a step beyond the Intel Pentium G 45 60
and a step below the Intel i3 6300 and
the AMD r3 1300 excess CPU ashes of the
singularity positions the RC 1200 stock
CD about equal within valves 20 mg 45 60
but otherwise predictably at the bottom
of our current gen listings overclocking
bolsters performance significantly
however jumping frame rate by 22.1%
which allows the CPU to tie the Sony 300
and follow the 1300 X overclocked CPU
for ashes escalation Metro and GTA 5
results check the article below but
we'll move on to blender and premiere
next
blender wasn't stable with our 3.9
gigahertz overclock so we stepped down
to 2.8 for this test the r3 1200 stocks
Evo completes the scene rounder in 102
minutes so it takes 14 percent longer
than the stock 1300 act and overclocking
gets the CPU down to 87
it's about tied with the 1,300 X because
we're down to just 4 cores 4 threads on
these are 3 CPUs the volunteer isn't
exciting it's not bad as stated in our
1,300 extra view yesterday but it's also
just not that interesting
if rendering really is of interest for
you and if using the CPU for rendering
is on the agenda more than infrequent
intervals we would recommend strongly
the r5 1500 X or 1600 for purchase the
cost is higher hence not recommending a
higher end part like ni nines in the
extreme but the render times are haves
within our 5 1,600 class CPU especially
ones overclocking it's a higher
territory that's a major savings in time
for anyone rendering even in light
freelance capacities and that time will
pay off premiere is more of the same the
r3 1200 stock CPU takes 198 minutes to
complete the render overclocked 1300 X
which is right where the 1200 would
perform when overclocked to completes
the round in 156 minutes compared to the
r5 CPUs in the 80 to 130 minute range
this is significantly slower our three
CPUs really aren't meant for these tasks
and again direct line to bump up and
tearing if rendering on the CPUs in the
plans
most of our from your workloads would
accelerate fine on GPUs though so it
just depends on what you're doing moving
on the power testing next as stated in
our r3 at 1300 X review power
consumption at the EPS 12-volt rails is
still brand new testing for us and so we
are no longer testing at the wall is a
different that means that we get a more
accurate measurement of what the CPU is
actually doing rather than what the
whole system is doing bear with us
though while we add more CPUs to these
presently sparse charts idle at the
Windows 10 desktop the r3 1200 is
presently our lowest power consumption
CPU at 2.5 watts idle consumption
followed by both the 1300 X and 1700
CPUs overclocking the r3 1200 3.9
gigahertz with the 0.1 volt offset gets
us to 9.8 watts idle followed by the
1300 X at 4 gigahertz using a real-world
blender animation project for the next
test we get a glimpse at power
consumption under a 100 percent
rendering load scenario the r3 1200 CPU
consumes 28 watts of power via EPS
12-volt cables when rendering at stock
settings placing at about 32 percent
lower than the r3 30 node X in actual
render performance as we just saw a
moment ago the difference is a 13% time
reduction with the 1300 x over log in
both pushes to 46 watts on the r3
152 on the 3100 X both reasonably low
power consumption for a part of this
class but obviously boosted with the OSI
the difference between them is largely
that X of 200 megahertz or 100 megahertz
depending on the OCC lien breed CPU this
is a stark contrast from and these old
reputation with CPUs the teams of the
company has largely resolved its FX era
high power and high thermal reputation
which of course the to coincide and go
hand-in-hand so thermals are reduced in
step with power consumption moving
knives to fire strikes physics test
another real-world scenario we see power
consumption at about 27 watts for the
are three twelve hundred and forty four
watts for the overclocked variant
drawing more than the 70 250 K happens
in part because of the additional
physical Hardware for the four core
configuration the architecture is also
obviously a bit different the r3 1300
excellent at 38 watt stock and 47 Watts
on overclock just like with the our 70 P
use overclocking is a great equalizer
for AMD's skews total war Warhammer is
next the r3 1200 runs the game at 30
watts peaks during the benchmark with
the 1300 ex stock CPU at 41.8 watts
there were talks variants to draw 49
watts and 54 watts respectively again
we're well within reasonable power
consumption metrics for parts of these
specs finally prime95 28.5 gives a more
torturous workload and lands the r3 1200
at 41 watts with the 1300 ex consuming
39 percent more at 57 watts
overclocking increases power consumption
on the r3 1200 by 48 percent and in at
60 watts and near the r3 1300 x at 64
watts so r3 1200 is in a significantly
more advantageous position than the 1300
ex and continues the interesting trend
and the as going with its stack just
like with the r7 series it seems most
wise to purchase the lower tier unit of
the r3 cpus as a both for core 4 thread
parts unlike the mixed thread are 5
parts and then opted for an overclocked
after that over-talking these CPUs is
trivial and we strongly encourage the
couple-minute venture to push to at
least 20 gigahertz on the 1200
performance uplift is noteworthy and
matches the 1300 acts equivalently but
with a lower price by $20 in this case
as for gaming performance that's the
interesting position the i5 cpus are
already challenged in their value
proposition by the r5 CPUs
talk about that in our our five reviews
the reason to recap all that here so the
high fives have been threatened already
in their position on the market the i3s
have also been threatened but not by AMD
by Intel's forty five sixty which is
still a good performer albeit somewhat
difficult to get a hold of it's still
out there and there are counterparts to
the forty five sixty that you can get
more easily so the IT CPUs have long
been cannibalized by Intel's own Pentium
series for this launch that makes our
threes interesting they further hurt the
i3 i5 opposition that is now we've got
this mix where our 5s kind of makes
sense in the mid-range area i sevens the
7700 K that is make sense my high-end
area for gaming if you want 144fps
unrestricted or something and then the
1700 does fine as a cheap h EDT part
from Andy where we don't know what's
going on is below the our 5s until today
anyway the G 45 60 still as of today it
makes no sense for an ultra budget
system where you really just want the
cheapest parts you can get throw in a
build and run a GPU of reasonable power
you go to an RX 570 or a GTX 1060 pretty
reasonably with one of those and not
really choke your GPU all that much
that's still a good part it's still
performing well and that hasn't changed
the r5 1600 Series CPU is still remain
our go-to for the mid-range the r3 is
kind of fill the gap between the 45 60
and the our 5s there there in the
financial sense at least but the
performance isn't as exciting as the r5
CPUs so it's not a bad CPU and saying
that something is adequate certainly
isn't offensive in and of itself unless
there are expectations there that maybe
weren't realistic but then again just to
emphasize the cv does well in testing
one and it's positioned competitively in
the market so it's not bad in either of
those aspects it somewhat invalidates
the 1200 that is the 1300 X just by
nature of overclocking but it's not
something where we're going to say just
go buy this right now because that's
kind of reserved for special cpus like
the r5 1600 X or 1600 we were really
impressed with the performance at the
price point and these just aren't that
special not bad just want to make that
clear
saying something isn't the go-to
recommendation doesn't mean we're saying
if that just means that it's not that
exciting so if you think it's more
exciting great go buy it it's out there
four hundred ten bucks as always you can
