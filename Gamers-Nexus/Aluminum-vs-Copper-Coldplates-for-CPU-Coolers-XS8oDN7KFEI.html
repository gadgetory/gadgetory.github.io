dotnet and today we're talking about
something pretty cool and fun but not
super applicable to the real world but
still interesting to know we ran tests
on two very similar effectively
identical liquid coolers using one major
difference and that is the cold plate
metal so we have an aluminum cold plate
here on ACE Tech's 510 LC and a copper
cold plate on the 550 LC and the
question I set out to answer was when
you have a high efficiency cooling unit
for CPU cooling like a liquid cooler
does the metal type does the cold plate
still bear significant relevance on the
cooling potential of that device when
mounted to a CPU under load and so we
put our CPU under 100% load we tested it
overclocked and stock using a 4790k
certainly not the world's hottest CPU
but for these CPU coolers it works just
fine
and we found a couple of measurements
that were interesting but perhaps not
too unexpected for the specs both of
these coolers are 120 millimeters we
mounted them to the same fan it's our
testbench fan hunter 20 millimeter fan
and both of them are 27 millimeters in
width or thickness 2 NM what you want to
call it and they both use the Gen 5 ASA
tech pumped Gen 5 a stick everything so
for a point of reference other current
Gen 5 ASA tech devices would include the
corsair h 100 i GTX the H ATI that's
brand new and any other gtx line courser
unit that's come out of this year those
are all Gen 5 ASA tech pumps and
basically courser goes to a detect or
other suppliers like kuwaiti they say we
want to buy this product and make these
modifications to it and then sell it as
whatever they end up selling it as so
it's not like they're just buying it off
a shelf there are some actual tweaks
going on behind the scenes but at the
end of the day the coolers that are
supplied to Coursera NZXT to other
providers are generally coming from
either ASA Tech or one of a few other
manufacturers in this case we've got the
510 and 550 LC units both of these are
available through the system integrator
channel so if you go to like CyberPower
ibuypower you will find both of these
you
normally or at least the 510 LC on one
of them in terms of branded manufacturer
models the 550 LC is out there and
branded under coursers flag so that is
an available product to the end-user the
test we look at is aluminum versus
copper in this instance so aluminum has
a thermal conductivity of almost half
coppers it's about 205 watts per meter
Kelvin for 25 Celsius load thermal load
and copper is 401 watts per meter Kelvin
for the same 25 Celsius load and what we
looked at here was how much thermal
dissipation potential exists in these
coolers per 100 watts and we found the
difference as you'll see in these charts
to be about point eight Celsius per 100
watts for the CPU cv generates about 88
watts and then after overclocking
there's a couple more watts thrown onto
that and the biggest difference is in
our overclock test it's one point one
Celsius difference in thrown walls
between the copper and aluminum cold
plates favouring copper of course
because it does have that higher rating
but the difference for the non
overclocked test is even smaller one
thing that this does tell us is that
with hotter CPUs maybe like AMD's FX
line it's possible that there will be a
greater difference these coolers are not
rated to cool some of the hotter CPUs
out there they're certainly not rated to
cool the 220 watt CPUs so we just can't
even test that but for what we're
looking at the difference between
aluminum and copper for a highly
efficient liquid cooler when cooling
something like the 4790k or other
high-end Intel devices the difference is
effectively non-existent it is barely
measurable it's just outside of margin
of error but only just and the reason
for this is possibly unlikely because
the efficiency of the pump is so great
that the aluminum and the copper even
with a 2 X difference in thermal
conductivity just doesn't matter as much
and the way these radiators work just as
a recap if you don't know it's very
simple this is the pump it sits on top
of the CPU and the pump is where there's
basically a little propeller inside of
the the enclosure
that we see that propeller spins and it
pushes liquid down into sort of a
channel below the top of the pump and
when the liquid goes into that channel
it flows through what are called micro
fins in the cold plate surface and this
is something I've actually done videos
on with an Tek and a Corsair in the past
have you checked the channel for those
so the liquid flows through these micro
fin channels and there are hundreds of
them depend on which cool you buy that
connects directly to the smooth cold
plate that we see here which connects to
the CPU the IHS more specifically and
then you've got the thermal interface in
between there to fill any imperfections
when the liquid goes through the micro
fins it is propelled back up into the
other tube goes through the radiator and
then if you know how radiator works in a
car it's the same thing here or any
other device really basically the liquid
flows through these tiny channels in the
radiator the fins on the radiator the
aluminum fins will siphon off heat they
conduct heat away from the channels that
the liquid flows through and then the
fan blows that heat away so it can cycle
and repeat like that so that is how it
radiator works and because it is a
highly efficient system the metals don't
matter as much now one thing to note
with air coolers the difference between
aluminum and copper could be pretty
substantial we don't know we haven't
tested it but the reason for that is
because they're more reliant on metal
there's a huge piece of metal sitting on
top of the CPU if you use an air cooler
so if you replace all of that copper all
the copper heat pipes the copper base
plate the copper whatever else you've
got if it's an older heat sink maybe
copper fins as well if you place that
with aluminum there could actually be a
performance difference that's
substantial I don't have to effectively
identical copper and aluminum coolers
that's pretty hard to come by I do
believe I could probably grab some old
zalman ones we might test that but just
for liquid basically the same so that is

will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
