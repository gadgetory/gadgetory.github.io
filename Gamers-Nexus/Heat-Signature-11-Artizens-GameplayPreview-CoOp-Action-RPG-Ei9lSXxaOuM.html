Nexus dotnet and today we are looking at
the upcoming Kickstarter project
artisan's which aims to centralize
character customization within the core
gameplay mechanics this four player
co-op action RPG grants players the
unique ability to draw their own
equipment and tweak each aspect of their
character
there are no classes no skill tree there
are no setting restrictions so if you
want to be a shot gun wielding pirate
who particularly loves his steampunk
styled jump boots you could certainly do
that this is sort of the central point
to artisans and I think it's a very
intriguing approach to game design
despite the fact that it seems somewhat
obvious once you've heard it
the reason creative driven games like
Minecraft are successful is they're Show
and Tell factored in minecraft you can
show a non gaming friend your creation
and he can appreciate it by a simple
Lego comparison and it's it's a very
visual customization driven game that
appeals to the creative mind and doesn't
particularly require a gaming skillset
to enjoy deeply to the same tune
although entirely different gameplay
artisans fills the creative desire by
offering players the option to use their
favorite art tools for asset generation
much the same way a game developer would
add content to the game because there
are no class or setting restrictions you
can be any character you want made up or
pre-existing so if you want to recreate
the cast of Firefly with your friends
you could do that from a visual
standpoint and perhaps even somewhat
mechanically each character has 12 total
item or buff slots there are six active
slots for weaponry and gadgetry and then
another six passive slots for buffs and
armor each item in the in the game is
not only customisable visually but also
statistically where players can utilize
bits and pieces drops from enemies to
mod their equipment for existence if a
scorpion drops its tail you might be
able to somehow work that into the stats
of your sword like adding a poison
attribute from what I understand and
keep in mind the game isn't complete yet
so from what I understand it seems that
players should have a fairly limitless
number of mods that can be applied to
each item though these are balanced by
tight pro/con modifiers
so hopefully there won't be too much
over balanced stuff although certainly
it will be found the upgrades in the
game are gained through progression in
the wilderness regions and by completing
missions artisan seems a bit more
promising than the standard kill X of
monster y quest though well at least I
hope it is but they list a couple of
different quests in their website and
first of all levels are broken up into
horizontally scrolling areas each level
will have something like ten areas
altogether so they're effectively ten
sub screens of the level and monsters
will intelligently move around within
those ten areas so if a mob it feels
outmatched it may retreat to another
area of the level to collective spirits
and prepare a new assault enemies are
also reactive to player actions and
movements in combat so they're not just
Goomba like patrollers in the admitted
style of megaman artisans enemies will
have weak points and reinforced points
so a Scorpion's tail once again to use
that example might be the best target
when trying to disable its ability to
damage you and send it cowering to
another area the same goes for limbs of
giants and and stuff like that each of
these mobs will drop upgrade items that
can then be applied to your weapons and
with any luck combat should be fun and
the dynamic enough in co-op mode that it
augments the core customization
component if you look at AP be very
customizable game holy disappointment
that it was so bad in terms of gameplay
was just way off balanced so these
things can certainly go wrong but with a
bit of luck and enough playtesting
hopefully the game will work out very
well
combat as I see it now seems like it
will be more of a means to achieve the
reward rather than the direct reward
itself which is also similar in games
like APB aside from apparel and weaponry
players can also customize pets so you
could add your own cat or iron golem to
the game or dragon or whatever turrets
are also there mechanically speaking the
customization tweaks made by imbuing
weaponry with mods will sort of speak to
the playstyle common in tabletop games
due to their limitless nature and by
mixing and matching any mods you'd like
with any gadget or weapon you'd like
it's entirely possible you could stumble
across a completely
never before tried combination of powers
that happens to be very powerful or
entirely powerless either way making for
gameplay that potentially no one has
experienced before
MMOs have the ability accommodations
that they can be quite fun when
discovered alone but there's a technical
limit to the depth available in games of
such large scopes as a Momo's with
artisans the idea is to centralize
around this concept making it more
mechanically deep and immersive than
other games were used to the devs made a
few comparisons to tabletop RPGs and
Magic the Gathering which really speaks
to the combo potential of the of the
options that they're implementing
there's a lot more to know about the
game but unfortunately that's all the
time I have for now so check out the
description below for a full link to the
article and the Kickstarter campaign
they've still got twenty four or five
days left so you have some time to make
a decision and I will see you all next
time peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
