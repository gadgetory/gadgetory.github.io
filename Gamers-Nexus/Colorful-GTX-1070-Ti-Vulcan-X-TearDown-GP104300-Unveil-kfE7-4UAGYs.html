top 1% of gamer the Vulcan for ultimate
performance or eye game Neptune special
glory of eye Gambari we're working with
colorful card today a 10-7 TTI colorful
is trying to get into the Western market
I'm sure that wasn't obvious and they're
doing so with the 1070 TI before getting
to that this content is brought to you
by the thermaltake flow RGB closed-loop
liquid cooler which is a 360 millimeter
radiator + 3 120 fans that are RGB
illuminated the if then we'll take it
ring fans at that this is a 4.5 done a
stack pump which is one of the faster
pumps you can learn more at the link in
the description below it's a colorful
hasn't really worked with US media too
much in the past they sent us this card
which has had its name changed a few
times this is a 10-7 TTI Vulcan X I
think is the current name the reason the
name has changed is because of the
Nvidia lock down on the clock so any of
the vendors who had things like
overclocked or OC or turbo or things
like that and their product names for
the most part has had to change them
because they're not able to actually
overclock the products they're shipping
them all base clock though you should be
able to overclock them on your own but
we'll look at that in the review so this
is colourful eye game Vulcan X which I
think falls under the Vulcan family for
ultimate performance not to be confused
with Neptune for special glory of I game
brewery and although the Box does make
mentions of things like Chanel and
Ferrari and rolls-royce I'm not not
really sure why so we're just gonna take
the thing apart and see what it looks
like underneath so that makes more sense
to me
so here's the card this is the Vulcan
access state it's a three fan card it
has a shroud that basically covers the
middle fan we'll look into that and then
we're gonna look at the heatsink in a
moment once we tear it apart for the top
interestingly there's an LCD up there so
that display is something we'll be
looking at in the review as well it's
supposed I'm waiting on drivers so I
don't have any
information or performance data today
but that's gonna be in there for for
looking at I don't know maybe it's a
thermal display or something like that
or customizable display they have an LED
over here that says eye game obviously
and then the back plate along with the
rest of the cooler this is I think a two
and a half or a three slot card it's
pretty phat there's your two slots and
there's your at least the half more
maybe three so a pretty big card but
let's start with taking it apart I think
for this one it looks fairly simple
haven't dismantled it yet but it looks
like well you know what let's just start
with the obvious the with the heatsink
screws and then I'll check these smaller
ones and see if we need to remove them
in a moment some of the smaller ones
over here
those might just be holding in the LED
panel as for performance reviews we will
have those up I think embargo lifts for
those on maybe the second or something
we're still waiting on finalized
information technically I think there's
an unboxing embargo lifts today or
something
unboxing embargoes are stupid and we
don't participate in them but we'll take
it apart and still do that so how that
fits within the rules it's actually
useful and it's something we were gonna
do anyway and I haven't seen the insides
of one of these I game colorful card yet
so really curious about that as well
Kable number one two more down here so
it looks like each fan has its own cable
as opposed to a single cable
there's your base plate not much going
on there definitely no service area
aside from the literal surface of it
pretty small die compared to what we've
been looking at with Vega lately so
where do we start with this one let's
start with the cables this cable going
up here is for the LCD you can see it
plugs into the LCD PCB up here with a
controller that PCB has the ribbon cable
connected from it going to the display
I'm not sure if I'm going to dismantle
that right now I don't know that I
really want to fight with a ribbon cable
but that's what's up there down here we
have what looked like two fan cables
wow that's pretty elaborate actually so
the cables are coming in down here and
they've got them pinned against the wall
of the shroud going down this way and
then you can see one of them comes out
over here so one terminates in the
center the other one is hooked up to
extension cables and those are pinned
over here and there was circle around to
a tiny PCB in there see if I can point
it out goes to some LEDs it's down there
where the screwdriver is so that's for
RGB the other one is for the fan so they
are actually all hooked up to one header
some spacers here not positive on the
surface material this looks like the
nickel plated copper cold plate although
that's pretty abrasive plating if so for
heat pipes we have we have six heat
pipes right here going through the cold
plate of which it looks like - we get
full coverage from these two on the GPU
die so these two are covering the GPU I
pretty much completely this one's got
about a quarter to half coverage this
one's got about a quarter to a tenth of
coverage on
died with the others on the parameter
for other cooling solutions what is this
contacting is that start jokes so
alright so this plate here just sinks
down to the PCB level so that's just not
positive it's touching the PCB but they
wouldn't really do a whole lot anyway I
guess it could conduct some heat that's
dissipating through the PCB but there's
not a lot there to grab for the rest I
think we're not to take off the base
plate so a base plate we've got no
direct contact with the chokes which you
don't need and may be no direct contact
with the caps which you also don't
really need that's fine yeah so the caps
end up right here under the heat pipes
which is perfectly fine assuming
adequate air flows down there we're more
concerned about the FETs so let's take a
look at those actually I need to see the
fats are right here so I need to see if
they're contacting anything - no the
MOSFETs do not have direct contact to
that plate so right here is where the
MOSFETs are where that thermal pad is
and that's feeding them in a straight
line under here there's no contact from
the heatsink so heat sinks kind of
wasting some potential there we'll look
at it and testing of course as always
but that's where it would contact if it
did it may be the case that they don't
actually need that contact it depends on
what their vrm is and it depends on how
much power it pushes depends on a lot of
things but we'll test all of that when
the time comes so let's get the base
plate off this base plate is more
familiar to cards that weren't designed
in the last maybe your or so because
just a flat piece of what I assume is
aluminum yeah flat piece of aluminum as
opposed to surface area created by like
pin fins to use EVGA s phrase or things
like that
tiny heat sinks stuff that we've seen
lately on MSI
use cards but again may not need all
that stuff we'll see especially if it's
not pre overclocked which it isn't if
they're on pads holding us down okay
obviously we've got memory so this is
gddr5 it is not gddr5 ex unlike some of
the rumors said originally it is normal
gddr5 and then thrown pad here though
there's no direct contact to the
heatsink but it is contacting the base
plate and then we also have while that
is some seriously like bend that out of
shape pretty easily so if you take this
apart yourself be careful if I go past
this point it's kind of snap we've got
some pads here for the feds memory and a
couple more fats over here actually so
what we have is these so these are East
69 30 MOSFETs we've talked to at least a
couple times in some of our tear downs
and PCB analysis videos that builds IED
has done and we have a total where those
69 30s a total of two if 14 total with
faces doubled for sure where the
doublers I think we need to take the
back plate off - okay back plate there's
your double errs now how things make a
little bit more sense okay so back plate
obviously a piece of metal with a
coating to prevent shorts and things
like that though it does mean that it's
not really good a transfer any heat at
all just like we saw in so tax card so
kind of mixed on those ideally you just
put some spacers somewhere or rely on
like the pads to prevent direct contact
and shorts about whatever the some of
the companies coat this stuff and it
kills the some of the transfer potential
where there could be some but actually
do they cover it up here too
now okay well alright so that's good so
they cut out the plastic where there's
actual thrown pad contact that's a good
thing that's what we want to see
so our doublers are here you remember I
counted I think 14 phases or 14 MOSFETs
I should say not phases and we have a
set of doublers those are the e 69 30s
on the other side doublers are on the
backside and that's what allows you to
get use of the phases and if you look
here this is where there was that
contact plate this thing which kind of
seems like it was touching the PCB for
really no reason now knowing what's on
the other side I guess it would actually
transfer some of that heat away from the
MOSFETs how significant that or I should
say from the doublers excuse me not the
MOSFETs so transfer some heat away from
here from this area how significant that
is remains to be seen on testing but
that's the idea for their implementation
then they've got a pad here to contact
the top side of them which sinks into
the baseplate
and hopefully you have some kind of
direct cooling on that because otherwise
it doesn't do any good and that's true
for every baseplate not just this one so
for the rest this is kind of going off
EBG A's approach they've got a big
thermal pad here contacting the plate
also that's on the backside of the
chokes so that will pull some heat away
from this area we have in testing with
ACX cards and other cards including zoo
attacks found some significant gains by
making a move like this and like this
with thermal pads so it does actually
help it's not always necessary and in
most cases it's not necessary and so far
as you're already operating within spec
of the MOSFETs they can take quite a lot
of heat however it doesn't hurt to get
the things cooler especially if it's as
easy as a thermal pad so they've done
well there too and we will again see and
test a and how that holds up but that's
most the card I think - 8 pins if I
didn't mention that what is this then
LEDs this is LEDs and then what's this
thing over here ok so that's kind of
interesting so you see the plug over
here little jumper
hooked up to a button not actually on
the back so here's a button which I
think says like turbo and normal or
something can't see it from here but I'm
guessing that's your fan speeds so kind
of curious to see how that impacts the
fan profiles but if you're into shunt
shorting those are over here three of
them right here I'm not going to tell
you how to short the shunts I don't know
what the best way to do it is with this
card because I haven't tried but let's
look at the GPU at GP 104 - 300 a one
the GTX 1080 which at this point feels
ancient is GP 104 400 and the gtx 1070
is GP 104 200 so they are all GP 104
GPUs and the 1080 could be if you had
for example 10 80s that fail validation
and that may be cores it didn't work
theoretically as a manufacturer and
Vidya could bend them down it's
something like this or the 1070 so
that's where it comes from yeah that's
the I game Vulcan x-gamer customization
ultimate performance Edition not to be
confused with the Neptune or a kuden or
whatever the other names how hard will
be looking at this pretty soon we are
still under performance embargo as
stated we don't do unboxings but
hopefully this gave you some actual
content to look at rather than a bunch
of marketing fluff that was put under a
special separate embargo because that's
the thing that the industry does now so
