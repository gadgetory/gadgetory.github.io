computer but looking at forums reddit
comment sections our forums or others
overclockers things like that you might
not know that especially if you're a
newcomer and this was part of the pc
building community that really drives me
crazy it's this attitude of elitism as
if there's only one way to do it
certainly that's not unique to our
community I'm sure every hobby and
profession has this I'm sure music has
I'm sure cars have it but the idea is
that there's one way to do it there's a
need to appear to be the smartest person
on the internet when communicating with
the newcomer
how to build something and normally that
involves arguing with everyone else in
the thread to make sure that the
newcomer understands you are in fact the
alpha PC developing and there's plenty
of other problems too if anyone's left
after that would be just there's no
respect for the subjective side of PC
building which coming from our channel
that's saying a lot this idea that again
one way to do it your parts it doesn't
matter what you think about them doesn't
matter your personal preferences they
are wrong and you should feel bad for
choosing them even if you've already
built the system and are just posting
photos to share it that by the way is
probably the least effective time to
share criticism but this I guess is a
continuation of the discussion we did on
yr nvidia and AMD so polarizing it's not
the same topic but it's the same feel
and that's I think for sunday is from
now on we might start pushing these
types of videos where it's more of an
industry look to step back from the
reviews and things like that I think the
main thing I wanted to address here
today is that if you're new to building
computers don't get discouraged by
comments that may either be infighting
between colleges who are trying to help
you on some support thread or accounts
that are just really heavily criticizing
your own build choices the things to
look out for of course compatibility if
it's not compatible yet you should
listen to them performance and price
always worth looking at but the thing is
it's not always just about price and
it's not always just about well you
picked these parts for $1,500 and I did
it better because I found the same
effective performing build for $1400 so
mine's better you should build mine
that's not really always how it works
right there's this idea of the user
experience
and what are they doing with that
machine they may not have detailed all
that in the post a lot of the times new
posters don't understand that they
should say things like I'm planning to
use this for rendering I'm planning to
use this for only Triple A games with
the highest graphics planning T's it's
only for indie games that doesn't always
get disclosed so probably the best first
answer is what are you using the
computer for not your build is bad
here's a better one without any context
for why and I think a couple things here
I pulled out some comments I guess we'll
just go through those to get us started
because it's the easiest way to show the
thing that I'm talking about let's start
with a pretty tan comment this is a new
builder named Peggy Nader on build a PC
didn't give a whole lot of info gave a
list of parts and asked if it looks okay
and the response is one of the main
responses is you should consider a small
SSD not a bad thing to consider they
asked the OPF okay what size do you
recommend
mad scientist says 64 gigabyte absolute
minimum 120 to 240 if you can strain it
okay so not all that useful is an answer
because it's basically saying any size
under 512 or whatever but but it's at
least a starting point because now we
know well you shouldn't buy 32 if you're
the new builder that's kind of what
you're thinking is the next reply is I
would honestly consider 250 gigabyte to
be the minimum these days okay so not a
better fly reply to that that would be
standard not minimum very definitive
with that period there - and that's
that's kind of what I'm talking about as
a more tame example because again this
is arguing over really stupid semantics
at this point standard not minimum I
provide something useful right like if
you're going to suggest 250 gigabytes as
a standard or a minimum or whatever say
Y say something like while your OS tends
after bloat and log files and hibernate
files and all these things tend to take
something like 30 gigabytes maybe with
some core applications installed so you
definitely want at least that much but
then maybe you want to leave some room
for core applications Adobe Photoshop
things like that or you're really
important media files or just because it
sucks to run out of space something like
that would be a lot more useful then you
look at the next reply I disagree okay
well that's really help
thank you but then you are out of touch
now you are okay so this point it looks
like we're just kidding around but this
is really not a houseful to anyone it
does there's no there's no status
there's no anything behind the
suggestions it's just kind of I don't
know whether the next one this is
someone who's asking please help me
convince me stubborn family to Delta TC
instead of buying something this is a
whole different discussion on why pre
builds actually do have value despite
kind of this elitism that DIY is the
only way to do it that's definitely not
true
and as someone who's built a lot of
systems for other people I'm sure many
of you have done the same I understand
why if I'm building a system for a
friend as many people in this thread
point out I will now be on the line for
everything bad ever that ever happens to
that computer and that means I've got to
provide pretext for and once we have
some kind of agreement and so there's a
reason to buy pre-built but that's a
different topic so one of the replies
here is if they're going to view a
computer as an appliance they're going
to buy a prebuilt you wouldn't build a
TV or washing machine would you actually
that's actually a really good analogy I
like that analogy they reply to that to
be fair on time building takes a few
hours at most and programs don't take
more than a day if you can't wait that
long you're very impatient so again I'm
not really trying to taking Tom's
there's hundreds if not thousands of
these readily available every day on
every forum YouTube channel everything
very readily available not helpful at
all and this one it's this falls under
my category of just really having no
respect for the needs of the user
it's this idea that well you can't build
it you're impatient or you're
incompetent or whatever but again if the
user in this thread especially is saying
I want to do the DIY approach but I
don't want to assemble it myself and
also I'm not going to be the one
providing tech support then yes they
should probably do pre-built it's not an
issue of patience it's an issue of does
it make sense and the answer is no not
for that user here's another one this
falls into another category where
there's no respect for the subjective so
we have a Caesar saying they should get
me into the PC world thought I'd share
my battle station six months in we've
got some photos of it looks like a
pretty damn good setup for someone who's
new to all of this and of course one of
the talents that's actually uploaded is
razor still a lot to learn comrade it's
so it all surprised the keyboard is a
complete waste of money membrane for
fifty dollars to and the user
saying I'm coming from only using a
laptop didn't feel like using mechanical
keyboards at least I think it was a good
purchase and that's all that matters
nothing else really matters if the user
is happy with it let them get it now of
course there are maybe other things to
consider but those aren't the only
things to buy so mechanical keyboards
that's another thing we're sure $50 you
get you an entry-level keyboard Moda or
something like that whatever Cale
switches beside him the any of those
types of bins you gun for 50 bucks
but some people don't like how
mechanical keyboards feel some people
like membrane because that's what
they've used forever I know one of the
EVGA employees
I had a long discussion with him at a
dinner once because he was saying he
really preferred the membrane keyboards
and likes that new Logitech one whatever
it was in the prodigy series that was
membrane and I of course at the time I
was like well but it's the same price as
mechanical so help me understand why why
do you like membrane keyboards I want to
know so that I can understand what it is
that you prefer and that's really the
discussion that should be had not you're
on no wrong and of course that extends
outside of the computer world but you
get what I'm trying to say it just
respect what the other people want to
use it's really that simple and it's not
a competition by the way there's proving
that you are the best at finding parts
on the internet for prices that are
whatever amount lower or that you have a
better ability to find price per
performance or value for the dollar why
this does it's not a competition that
there's no there's no gain from that all
you're doing is either offending people
or shooting people away from a computer
community this DIY community or like
okay well alright fine I'm never posting
here again that's kind of the response
that happens
let's look at one more or two more even
this is from our friend Paul's hardware
one of his at PC builds you can always
find the best comments on these and this
user said 230 dollars is way too much
for a motherboard for this particular
bill that was pretty high-end and here's
the same again
given his Paul he knows how to build a
computer so there's no point really
saying that he knows what he wanted and
it doesn't even matter if it's Paul or
not it could be any random Internet user
posting that one after it's built it's
pointless
doesn't help anyone other than maybe
make them second-guess their choices if
they're new that's really again not
helpful - he wanted to use it and so
what I for $230 you can get something
that's got more phases for overclocking
so the VRI might be a bit stronger they
might use better sets that are just the
cheapest sets in China and I can sustain
more amperage going through and can help
with stability V droop all kinds of
things or maybe it just got something
that's got better memory support or it's
got a chipset that is more useful for
the particular build and that's another
thing like this one on the same video
the 7600 K is more than enough to play
any game 1440p mac settings no point in
wasting money here's the problem with
that line of thought this idea that
again another video topic here and i-5
is enough for everyone period it's wrong
it's not enough for everyone people who
might be doing blender rendering or in
this case video production you can
leverage that extra either frequency or
core count or cache or whatever it may
be that the particular CPU provides and
further we saw in our own testing like
with watchdogs - in the video published
yesterday or two days ago that there is
actually a difference between i7s and
i-5 in some games not all of them so it
is true that in i-5 for a good amount of
people will be fine but for specific
audiences that i7 could matter and just
reading everywhere that at i-5 is enough
and they go buy an i-5 and find out I
can't hit 144 Hertz and that's all I
wanted that's all I cared about
they're going to be kind of out of luck
so it's again this is an issue of
all of this can be avoided by providing
substance with what is said of course by
shutting up when you don't know what
you're talking about which is a problem
everywhere and just generally kind of
trying to understand the needs of the
person which is what of course
professionals do if you go to a PC
building shop hopefully they would they
would do that for you but the DIY
approach is just flooded with all these
types of comments it's pretty
disappointing
I even stuff like there were other
common streets are on one of our builds
when I did that whole render rig rebuild
then there were comments why not use
them why not use a real open loop why
not use a real custom loop for the
system well it doesn't make sense for us
it's easy to deploy in AI oh and that
system I've got a lot of them there are
protections configured on the system so
if there's ever a point of failure the
system will shut itself down to protect
itself because we've set a lower
temperature than t.j.maxx as a shutdown
threshold so it's fine and these are all
things that it might not be disclosed
sometimes they are and either way
there's more than one way to do it and
in that particular case a o is what I
wanted to use I know what I'm doing I
know what the good and the bad are of an
AI Oh probably better than a good amount
of the comment but you know it's just
that's how I wanted to build it it was
easy it was fast and we could deploy it
immediately that's what mattered for a
production system that was down it's not
just sort of creator and media outlet
comments that are frustrating we put
ourselves out there as I said before
you'd expect some kind of criticism
whether it's justified or mindless if
you're in that position but for
newcomers I would like to see a bit more
working together to try and figure
things out then you're Bill drawn his
suggested bills run her bills run
everyone's drawn use mine here's a link
to PC partaker where I put it together
in a few minutes because I am so damn
good
so that's it's just it's again it's
frustrating we'll probably do a couple
of these videos maybe one every Sunday
or something like that there's plenty to
talk about it's not just because it's
not just bones to pick with the industry
of the community but
that's always the part that kind of
rattles around in my head when I'm
reading through all the comments and I'm
sure a lot of other people have the same
frustration because a lot of them just
probably don't even post cards because
the greater majority of viewers and
readers don't cause constantly just want
to consume the content so thank you for
watching I know it's not a review
benchmark theme like that but as always
we have tons of those coming up probably
every single day next week plus an FCN
so check back to that subscribe for more
patriotic the post roll video to help us
out directly links in the description
below for our social media pages there
will probably not be an article on this
I'll see you all next time
