got this in the mail this is not
something I requested this is an MSI
Seahawk X I believe yes it is a Seahawk
ek card so the ek part is because it is
an ek it water blocks water block on
here that's very reflective so try to
point at the camera too much but
basically we don't have a wet bench
right now we don't have an open-loop
bench to test this thing and frankly
just don't have the time budget to do
that right now so we're going to tear it
down just kind of look at it and see
what it looks like internally because I
haven't seen that done a lot yet and
then it will probably go back to MSI
because I'd just there's a million other
things to test post pax so this is the
card it is clocked at 1847 megahertz
it's a custom PCB MSI board for the 1080
and then it's using an ek kit so you've
got the sort of acrylic housing here the
liquid goes in on this side out on this
side if you want to set it up that way
that's kind of the recommended setup so
it goes in through this channel around
here and out and it is a full-coverage
block which means it's actually covering
all of the hotspots on the board that
includes the GPU itself which is sort of
under this area here and then the vrm
which will be more over here the PWM is
also covered with this block so this is
a bit different than an a IO solution
so an a IO solution like the EVGA hybrid
or the hydro graphics or seahawk liquid
cooled card without an open-loop
solution those use a CLC that just
covers the GPU in the one exception
being the EVGA hybrid where they have
that copper plate on the vram and stuff
like that which we talked about in our
review and our teardown of that card but
the idea on the hole is that this
solution will cover the whole card and
so you get a bit better
potentially bit better thermal
dissipation but of course because more
of the card is covered the temperature
shown for the GPU will actually appear
they're somewhat higher and that's
because the liquid temperature is higher
then if you're just cooling the GPU only
in nothing else almost
okay so eleven screws to take off the
backplate there's your backplate really
nothing nothing special there so a
backplate held by eleven screws I think
we just used an a.1 head to remove those
we don't need these on here so let's get
rid of that so there's the back of the
PCB GPU is obviously right there and the
GPU the actual part that's mounting over
it right is secured by these four screws
so that's your sort of core heatsink
mounting a tension right there and then
the rest of it is going to be secured
through these allen key heads I think we
can kind of just take these out not sure
cool so four screws for tensioning the
block itself just put my hand right on a
thermal pad four screws for tensioning
the block itself to the unit this is the
liquid cooling block completely
separated from the PCB obviously this is
the part that's going contacting the GPU
directly so there's your silicon contact
pretty much perfect with the thermal
paste spread a couple of these thermal
pads to get left on the board but that
doesn't really matter so the thermal
pads for covering the vram modules these
are actually high-quality conductive
thermal pads big pad right here for the
MOSFETs and the capacitor bank and you
may notice that there's actually a
very slight inward sort of bezel right
here and that's where the chokes go
so the chokes don't need to be directly
cooled there is a bit of air channeling
over here there's not really air flow
but because chokes or inductors are sort
of cooled by default just by these
little heat sinks they have on them and
because they can go up to 120 Plus
Celsius there's no real reason to put
them under liquid they'll just kind of
increase the liquid temperature without
an actual benefit other than increasing
the temperature of the rest of the
component all right so the benefit here
is basically that they've given you
everything pre applied so you don't have
to install this yourself which is often
the case EK has done some QC here you
can see they've done leak testing
already I'm not sure that's showing up
but it says leak tested quality control
passed so theory should not leak out of
the box certainly not something you want
but that's the block moving to the card
we can look at the PCB now we've got the
GPU here so this is the GP 104 GPU for
GT X 1080 cards and the RAM modules here
as provided by micron these are ggr 5x
as all GTX 1080s will be this is
actually covered by the block so it's
really not something not accessible not
something you'll use but that that's
just either it's a header for either a
debug jumper or for a fan that we've got
more over here there's an LED header as
well but that's just probably left it
mostly leftovers on the card because it
is a reused PCB chokes also known as
inductors right here high-quality SFC
chokes capacitor bank and then the fats
are all right here let's see are these
so for the MOSFETs very small text can't
really see it but it's using m38 1 6 n
MOSFETs which you can learn more about
these in our EVGA fftw PCB analysis
we're building talks a bit about
different types of MOSFETs
so we do cover some of that there but
that's what it's using for this card and
it is set up as a yes
10 phase setup on the PCB and the rest
is pretty standard but very large PCB
with a large block to go on it the
liquid if you wanted to buy one of these
see the problem we have is that we just
don't have a wet bench setup right now
and that's because to use one of these
if you're not familiar with them you
would need an open-loop liquid cooling
solution set up on your system so this
connects to your open-loop solution
that's already in the computer one thing
we are looking at is the new EK predator
so i do actually have one of those we
will be testing it thermally and FPS and
all that but the way that set up is it's
an EK radiator with sort of a qrc valve
for the the tube so it's Tec it's sort
of an a io a sort of a closed loop
system but it's got these quick
disconnects that we've shown with PNY
several years ago and with EVGA at CES
this year so those qrc valves they can
be disconnected and they don't leak
because they've got a spring tension in
there to basically close a sort of
closed a trap door and prevent leakage
and that can be connected to other quick
release valve radiators so you could
actually create a sort of fake open-loop
cooling solution for the CPU and the GPU
you would use a block similar to this
but not quite the same but the idea is
similar except it's pre filled with
liquid this does not have any liquid in
it if you have not noticed that's
because the idea of this is you're meant
to fill it with your own with your own
open-loop but the ek predator setup is
actually pretty new the way it's set up
it could either be completely pointless
or pretty cool so we will be testing
that one but I did want to take this one
apart just because it was kind of a
different card we won't be testing it
MSI sent it I said hey we don't have a
wet bench
can you give me a shipping label I'll
send it back to and they're like can you
take it apart
so that's what we did it was it was
worth pulling apart but very easy to do
obviously so if you wanted to do this
it's 11 screws to the back plate and
then for for the block you don't have to
take off the back plate to get the block
off you can just take off the four if
you wanted to expose the PCB for
whatever reason maybe it's a shunt short
the shunts for a mod for overclocking or
something like that
those are all very rapidly exposed we've
got a couple shunts here very easy to do
so that's all for this video as always
patreon like the post well video to help
us out directly link to the description
below for more information stay tuned
for our gigabyte coverage of the
liquid-cooled gigabyte card and i am
still sick from pax so thanks for
watching this far I'll see you all next
