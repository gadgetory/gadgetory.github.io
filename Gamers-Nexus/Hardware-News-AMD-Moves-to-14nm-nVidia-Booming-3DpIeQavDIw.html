and this is your weekly news recap of
the hardware news the past couple of
days our game and news recap should be
on the channel shortly if not already
that covers the game stuff so now we're
talking our hardware the main news item
off the top here is AMD's production of
14 nanometer FinFET lpp chips which are
low power plus they're called this is in
cooperation with GlobalFoundries the
fabrication plant actually working on
the production of these chips and
GlobalFoundries announced that the 14
nanometer lpp chips have achieved a
level of success that they feel
comfortable pushing into production so
AMD and GlobalFoundries are now
producing their 40 nanometer chips and
is and are assuring output of them into
consumer and enterprise products in 2016
so you can expect 14 nanometer lpp
devices in 2016 and these will include
high power compute applications consumer
applications GPUs things of that nature
so it will be used in items that we on
the gaming side will actually see on the
market which is pretty exciting to see a
new process on its way from AMD and
GlobalFoundries and of course we can't
talk about Andy without also talking
about nvidia and vidya posted its
financial data for quarter 3 2015 today
and projected out into 2016 so we have a
good look at the future here and for now
they've reported record revenue at 1.30
5 billion a seven percent year-over-year
growth and the ga AP reports are looking
at a fifteen percent year-over-year
growth you can find more information on
the financials and all of that in the
link in the description below bouncing
back to Andy in our tennis match between
the two major manufacturers Andy this
week announced its Radeon software a
company meant for its GPU so this is
replacing catalyst control center which
will now be retired radeon software is
expected in the next few weeks and we
already have a full video about this on
the channels check that out for full
details but the software aims to produce
a minimalistic interface that's updated
modern all these buzzwords that am
used in their call and they're hoping to
sort of upgrade functionality to make it
a little bit easier to use than the
catalyst control center which even
though it works fine sometimes it does
look a bit dated and so does the Nvidia
control center for that matter but
moving forward and they will be
switching to radion software and they
are retiring CCC check the other video
for full information on that the next
news item is about liquid cooling so e
KW b or EK water blocks as they're more
commonly known announced their prefilled
liquid blocks for the predator aio
system and this is an interesting aio
liquid cooling solution in that it's not
the standard aio it's on the standard
all-in-one so the predator system uses
quick disconnects or QDC and this is all
built using technology that we saw a few
years ago with PNY and service solutions
and things like that the thing with the
predator is that it's got one tube with
QDC in it and then you can plug in other
systems so if you want to have a sort of
closed loop cooling solution for your
cpu and your GPU you can do that with
the QDC valves which allow an airtight
connection of the tubes from multiple
radiators multiple pumps without going
to a full open loop solution which might
be intimidating to some builders and a
certainly price prohibitive so that is
the ek predator we haven't tested it yet
we're not sure it's actually good how it
works but we will try and get our hands
on one for a future video and article
cryo rig and other liquid cooling news
has announced its new a series of liquid
coolers and these are pretty interesting
these actually mount the fan on the cpu
block and the pump so there's a 70
millimeter fan mounted on the pump and
block and this is meant for cooling
nearby components like the vrm which
gets pretty hot so if you've got an
overclocking system and you're burning
up your vrm heatsink the problem with
using an aio or any liquid cooling is
that there's no drafted air through a
normal air cooler to cool down
neighboring components Ram is another
one so this block ads the 70 millimeter
fan on the top of the CPU itself and
then feeds to normal radiator as
these are available in 240 millimeter
and 280 millimeter variance with
different size radiators so there are
thicker ones and thinner ones depending
on your space in your enclosure but this
also impacts the cooling efficacy so
that's the cryo rig a series at liquid
cooling solution like the ek stuff we'll
try and look at these but as always
check link in description below for more
information that is it for your weekly
hardware news recap check the channel
for the game news recap and as always
hit that patreon link the postural video
helps us out a lot I will see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
