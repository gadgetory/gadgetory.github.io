for the week this one we're announcing a
live stream of ours which might turn
into a 1v1 me bro versus builds or later
I'm sure that all important for me but
whatever we are also talking about a lot
of huge news in the industry one of the
news items is about China and a court
order temporarily banning the sale of
micron devices in China there's also
news on Intel 9000 series not
necessarily ninth gen but 9000 series
CPUs and some news on nvidia gtx 11 60s
and 11 80s as leaked oops by Lenovo an
official partner before that this video
is brought to you by thermal grizzlies
high-end thermal paste and liquid metal
thermal grizzlies cryo knot is an
affordable high quality thermal compound
that doesn't face some of the aging
limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted test by a tube at the link
in the description below so for the
first thing the GN news the live stream
will be in a few days so Wednesday July
11th at 6 p.m. Eastern Time on YouTube
and we're gonna be doing an ad 86 K over
clock alive possibly with the good old
Titan V that we've shelved the since our
rip Ltd stream so should be a lot of fun
in the stream I'll set some goals for
what fire strikes core whatever
benchmark views we're trying to achieve
what frequency were trying to achieve I
have not done anything with this 8086 K
it just came in my plans are to probably
deal it apply liquid metal something
like that put under a big cooler and
we'll just see how far we can put it
should be a lot of fun to watch and see
if we can achieve the goals that we set
forth with and then the goal from there
is to take that experience from that
stream and hopefully do a 1v1 vs. build
Zoid later on where the hope is that
he'll be able to stream to an ingest
server we have here and then we'll take
that video and manipulate it so that he
loses actually probably what we'll do is
we'll take
video and be able to put out his stream
and our stream at the same time through
just the GN livestream so you'll be able
to watch both of us compete for
overclocks against each other
spoiler alert he will win but I'll put
up a really good fight so it should be a
lot of fun and maybe he'll hold back
some hold pull some punches too while
he's at it final news item from us is
the limited edition shirt that I've been
talking about that foil shiny one is
going to be ending the presale that'll
be it basically on next week or this
week basically after the livestream will
be ending sometime the next few days
thereafter because we're almost out of
inventory already and we want to hand
onto at least a couple for when it
actually arrives if you don't want a
pre-sale but if you want to definitely
make sure you get one period right now
on stored on Aaron's axis net it's
limited edition we will not make it
again and it's the foil version of our
10 year anniversary shirt design first
real news item chinese court orders and
a temporary ban on micron component
sales following a patent lawsuit micron
has been issued a preliminary injunction
halting the sales of more than 26 of
their products in China including DRAM
and NAND initial reports indicated that
this might have been much more
significant than micron seems to think
it will be naturally because micron is
not going to admit that it's going to
kill their sales but they do have a good
idea of what's happening to so temporary
ban is following a legal battle with UMC
which is United at micro electronics
corporation where a Chinese Court ruled
in favor of UMC following a patent
infringement case brought against micron
by UMC UMC sought action against micron
last January and they accused micron of
infringing on their patents relating to
memory and storage the case itself is
part of a bigger battle that's been
going on for a while between micron and
UMC we're micron maintains that UMC has
acted as a conduit for theft of patents
and trade secrets and they're trying to
micron seems to be indicating that this
is in effort of bolstering China's
domestic memory ambitions something that
the Chinese government has been
interested in for quite some time now
once news broke of the injunction micron
stock fell as much as
percent whereas UMC's rose by two point
nine percent but there's a sock market
so that doesn't really mean a whole lot
micron following this news story there's
another one that's brand new micron
issued a statement on this patent
lawsuit and related to the previous
story micron said on July fifth the
following the patent infringement claims
of UMC and jinhua were filed against
micron in retaliation for criminal
indictments filed by Taiwan authorities
against UMC and three of its employees
and a civil lawsuit filed by micron
against UMC and genoise in the United
States District Court for California for
the misappropriation of micron trade
secrets micron expects the actual impact
on this band from the Chinese market to
be less than 1% of its revenue for the
year annualized and the band
specifically outlaws some crucial and
ballistics DRAM modules not a big
Dominator in the market anyway oh that
was a good pun Dominator which cut the
DRAM modules for crucial and ballistics
comprised under two percent of microns
total annualized revenue and the company
states that it is on target to hit 8.0
28.4 billion for the year which is what
it targeted previously the company is
however appealing the case and micron
also issued this further statement
micron is disappointed with the ruling
by the Intermediate People's Court we
strongly believe that the patents are
invalid and that microns products do not
infringe the patents the court issued
this preliminary ruling before allowing
micron an opportunity to present its
defense and related to this micron has
filed its civil lawsuit against UMC in
California Intel news next so there's
been some discussion of potentially
ninth gen or at least 9000 series 8th
gen parts the coffee lake lineup not
clear on what's happening exactly yet
with those but we did receive some
substantial documents relating to this
and then some of its already been posted
online so between those two sources of
information what we know is the
following basically it's looking like
there's going to be an I 594 109 596
hundred ninety-six hundred K this is
really not that surprising at this point
9400 t
and what we really need to know though
is how these change versus the existing
coffee like line up so first of all this
is something that Intel accidentally
posted in its micro code revision
guidance document and we have all of
them one of them is 574 pages lon and
another 160 pages of just CPUs and
specifications
so the SKUs seem to retain the same core
counts and TDP roughly for all the ones
I just named and the TDP envelope has
their predecessors but they ratchet up
frequencies by 100 to 200 megahertz out
of the box and cache size and socket
type all remain the same as well what is
additionally interesting and we have
some tables on this from from another
website we'll put the source on the
table when we pop it up but we have some
tables with specs additional news though
8 core parts can be seen referenced in
the 574 page Intel document that we
obtained I think they might have
accidentally posted online as well so
this specifically identifies boost
behavior for 8 core products which means
yes it is coming if you didn't already
think that and there's a rumor - I $9.99
100k that is rumored to be 8 core 16
thread or an i7 9700 k room it has 6
core 12 threads none of that's confirmed
but it does seem likely that there will
definitely be an a core part because
Intel specified it in that document as a
quick aside for that news story Intel is
approaching their 50th anniversary and
co-founder of Intel and father of
Moore's law Gordon Moore has offered
some interesting insight to the history
of the company we'll post a link in our
news document where we have the show
notes if you want to read it and get
some a history background it's an
interesting read and worth clicking on
hit the link in the description below
for the news dog and pick up that link
next up very briefly Nvidia and some GPU
leaks so some of these are more
legitimate than others because Lenovo of
all people have been out there
accidentally leaking things Lenovo
recently let slip that the Legion Y 530
laptop will ship with the GTX 1160
allegedly which will apparently have 6
gigabytes of memory we would assume it
would be G DDR 6 at this point since
that's what most if not all the next
series of GPS will be using at least on
the high end and this is after
previously talking on camera about
lenovo's plans to push a gtx 1180 for
its desktops in the 730 series of
desktops when speaking with a gaming
publication on youtube I believe called
brain beam where they accidentally said
that an 1180 will ship down the road
sigue is a means return to the consumer
markets the Seagate 600 and 600 Pro from
2013 were the last consumer focused SSDs
from Seagate this week the company
announced that they plan to bring their
Barracuda SSD to the consumer segment
I'll be it specs and prices at this
point are scarce the an intact story
notes that it most likely uses the gen
64 l 3d NAND and it has an unspecified
controller Barracuda is a 2.5 inch SATA
based SSD with capacities up to 2
terabytes and the Drive offers speeds
expectant with the SATA interface 540
megabyte per second or so sequential
read and 520 sequential write 90 ki ops
random read at this point we're against
the SATA interface anyway and there's
also supposed to be a five-year warranty
but not super interesting as just sea
gates looking to come back to SSDs
apparently and then some additional news
here hardware sales and GN news one more
note this blue print shirt I'm wearing
if you wanted it when we launched it it
sold out instantly thank you for those
of you picked it up took us a couple
weeks to get it back in stock but it's
back now so in store dye game is X it's
not net you can grab this or the limited
edition shirt if you want either one of
those they are in stock and basically
all the sizes that we carry and we did
pick up a couple of exercises for the
blue print shirts and then hardware
sales so gtx 1070 is are still a good
price right now 4k monitors we also
noticed are on pretty good discounts
overall so we'll post some links to
those or pop Newegg up on the screen
while I'm talking right now with a
couple of the sales that we saw for
those they do change basically every day
at this point but unfortunately and I've
tracked RX Vega 56 is still not that
great of a deal we really want it to be
because if it gets closer to its
original MSRP plan that was a actually a
really fun card to work with one of the
most fun TV as we worked with last year
in terms of
ability and also pretty competitive at
the target price and its original MSRP
it's just it's still not down
unfortunately part of that is because
Vega has retained its mining abilities
whereas the Pascal cards have fallen off
a bit so unfortunately we keep looking
we haven't seen any Vega sales yet but
we'll let you know as soon as we do
because Vega 56 was actually a fun card
to work with and pretty worth it at the
right price Vega 64 not so much just
because 56 is so close to it already and
you can flash it but that's it for this
one as always stored on cameras axis
