build-up and then following that post
the review of it but the big thing there
is we still needed something similar to
compare against and that is what we're
building up today this is an ek solution
that hooks into the ek 280 predator XL c
cooler and it's also just like the Alpha
: a semi custom loop solution with
quick-release tubes so we're gonna be
looking at that today we're building it
and then the review will come pretty
immediately after this content though is
brought to you by AMD and there are X
480 conveniently ek also makes an Rx 480
water block that you can buy and hook
into the same predator X I'll see so if
you want to liquid cool your 480 then
there is an option for that and just to
remind everyone we did a liquid cold for
80 some months ago and saw that there
was actually an overclocking potential
increase that we got out of it and
that's pretty standard with these
solutions whether it's a 480 or a 1080
or whatever with the GT X 1080 here in
front of me founders Edition card and
the ice wolf cooler from alpha cool we
were able to get not much but about a 10
megahertz extra overclock on the thing
and then and that's over another liquid
solution mind you so the overclock over
reference is actually quite substantial
but over another liquid solution it was
10 megahertz we were hitting something
like 21 13 megahertz max clock rate in
gaming scenarios it's pretty damn high
and that was thanks to liquid with air
it can't do nearly as well unless he
blasts the VR I'm fan at a hundred
percent so that's what these things help
with of course the value is always what
we talked about in the review because
value is not necessarily great with this
type of project but it is an enthusiast
project and that means that you're doing
it at least partly because you want to
and that's as good a reason as any so
we're installing this one just to kind
of point it out the 481 right here and
the 1080 one in my right hand that's
what we've got to work with I'll
probably be doing that one shortly but
we're starting with a 1080 today just
because I've already got data on it for
other cooling solutions so that's what
they've got these are the same overall
design and basically we end up with the
contact plate here and this is all
just gonna conduct completely from the
inductors here we've got inductor
contact we have MOSFET contact we have a
VRAM contact here around the GPU of
course GPU contact and then capacitor
bank contact so this will it's it's a
full-coverage water block basically this
is a proper full-coverage water block
and it's a bit different from alpha
cools ice wolf in that regard so we're
gonna connect this to 1080 the hardware
it's been done it's already torn down
it's been torn down a million times now
there's probably feeling a little bit
beaten up at this point so we're
attaching this things to note as
previously I've got thermocouples
attached to the card to the PCB it's one
of the backside here it's not really
going to interfere with the conductivity
that much to a backplate if we install
one and then on the front side this one
kind of needs to be risa cured obviously
it's a bit loose but that's gonna touch
the third mosfet up from the bottom and
that'll give us our mouse by reading so
that'll go right there the adhesives
getting a bit dry though but I will I'll
fix that as we go through just to show
off the tube system before we get into
installation this is what I was talking
about in our alpha cool ice wolf
coverage when I said that they're tubes
which I have right here just to show you
and remind you I said their tubes were
pretty bad this is what I was working
with you unscrew this to do the
disconnect it's not exactly a quick
disconnect it's kind of a quick
disconnect that's more prone to leaking
by accidents than the EK version and
it's got some quality control issues EK
is version is the one that I said is far
better but also you pay a bit more for
them and we'll cover this more in the
review but just to really quickly show
you how it works it's pretty damn cool
hit the switch and there it is the
disconnect it's not gonna leak there's
like one tiny drop of liquid on there
but that's it there's no real risk of
leaking at all disconnect it and then we
would disconnect this one over here on
the CPU cooler so this if when we're
done with the insulation you take this
cooler and we would disconnect just like
that and then you hook them together and
you end up with a semi-custom loop so
that's pretty cool now not quite as
effective as a custom open loop but also
much easier and probably a bit more
accessible for some people ok so let's
get started for this we've got thermal
pads from ek these are the blue pads
that came with it it's a few things here
these are cut to size a bit better than
the Alpha cool ice wolf ones these pads
go on the vram and then the rest of the
pads that we have will go on the vrm
components so to apply these we peel off
the plastic from both sides and then you
just drop it onto the vram module and
we're going to do that seven more times
I'm going to tap my anti-static wrist
strap that's grounded to the ESD mat and
then into the wall just for good measure
working with this stuff and cold and dry
weather it's just not good for a static
electricity like a better way to peel
this yes they are a bit stickier yeah
yeah they're better so these are
stickier than the Alpha coil ones which
is nice big fan of that
okay that's the vram thermal pads down
you should expect these to take about
one hour per thermal pad to get off of
the blue sticky stuff apparently it's
it's pretty adhesive but next we're
gonna be installing I have to cut this
to size this one well install here what
we're covering here if you're not
familiar with the basics of the PCB VRAM
VRMs up here we've got MOSFETs here and
then doctors or chokes if you've heard
that word the same thing and then the
capacitor bank over here so we are
covering with thermal pads the MOSFETs
which pretty much become the hottest
they can withstand about a hundred fifty
C well depends but 150 C t.j.maxx is not
unheard of for these things so we put
that there that'll conduct with the
plate you'll see here that when I set
this down this channel in the plate is
going to align with the inductors those
will go in there and then on this side
we've got the fat's contacting via the
thermal pad so that provides a thermal
interface which improves our transfer by
I say liquid on T oh where did that come
out of probably the tubes not fully
connected oke there's some there's some
drops on the tube right there yeah J so
let me make sure that's fully sealed
it's really only a few points of failure
for these so alright so I was saying uh
yeah it all lines up we're gonna go
ahead and put that second thermal pad on
there you need to cut it the size I need
to make sure this kind of stays in place
to which the pad and the tension should
hold it all where I want it to be which
is on top of that MOSFET as we found out
last time box cutters work pretty well
for this because my iFixit tray as a
cutting board a sweet
extra always nice to have extra thermal
pads oh these are sticky that's good so
position this right want it just on top
of the FET
very nice and that is so much better
than we were working with the other day
I'm not sure what the thermal
conductivity is but we will find out in
testing how good the thermal performance
is which is really all that matters
application though far better than the
ice wall so far just by using a better
pad now this one for the FETs or sorry
for the inductors
all right nice
very nice now the best part that
everyone likes to talk about thermal
paste I put a bit here in the middle oh
that comes out very fast okay that
should be that should be Apple and
because it needs to be said every time
you can be a bit more generous with this
thermal paste on a video card because
that's the wrong way because you are not
dealing with my age as like on a CPU so
don't be as concerned about that so
that's gonna go right there I think
we've taken care of everything we're not
gonna need the LED or the fan headers so
now it's just a matter of putting this
down and then tightening it all
okay that's a Polish that later all this
fingerprints okay nice nicely done if I
do say so myself now begins the Emporium
of screws this is what they give you
it's a little bit overkill and washers
little tiny washers so there's actually
a bit easier then they make it look you
need the 2.5 by 4 screw which is that
one everywhere and a washer with each
one my Deeley
just to kind of prevent scratching and
for spacing and then there's going to be
a longer screw in the back which is the
5 by 6 that will be the 2.5 by 6
it's a 2.5 by 6 is what we're gonna be
using for the i/o area once we get there
need a screwdriver washers ok you want
to make sure there's even pressure from
all those to avoid cracking any silicon
now we can start doing all the other
ones
I think there's 13 screws in this step
if we can line up that would be great
okay there's your classic error don't
screw everything in until you got them
all in the right spot don't don't follow
you screw them down trying to go halfway
on all these and then go through and
finish them on the way if I mentioned
that I hate washers I never put this
last screw and I always just use the DVI
ones to hold this in place but I guess
we'll just go ahead and do it for this
sake of being complete nothing for that
to mount into so these if you really
wanted to use one of these little washer
nut things to go on the other side of
the 2.5 by 6 screws or and secure them
around that that expansion plate but I'm
not gonna do it because I don't want to
okay so I think we're basically done
here now I could mom actually I guess we
couldn't do that I was gonna say we
could remount the back plate that comes
with the card but actually we can't we
would have to use the other end set
screws that it comes with to do that I
will do it as quickly as mount the rest
of the i/o shield though all right so
we're done this is the finished product
just need to get it installed in the
system and the loop test it out why is
that screw there we need to we need to
tighten these all down remember when I
said we're you're gonna do them all
halfway and then finish it at the end
well you need to need to actually do
that part
okay hey let's try that again so there
we go there's our finished product
now with screws secured it looks pretty
good
where you see how it performs but I am
definitely interested in this one so
we've got the full coverage front side
complete with fingerprints that need to
be wiped off and then these will simply
as I already sort of demonstrated simply
connect to this after I've already
mounted it to the system so it's not
quite ready yet I need to mount it to
the rest of the system first but I am
loving these quick releases because
there's really no we're not losing any
liquid here which is great because that
means better usability long term no real
needs refill but there is a refill port
on the giant radiator here the exile sea
280 so we could actually fill it if we
needed to but we don't so this is what
we end up with we got our CPU cooler and
we've got our GPU 1080 cooled by the
block and that cools the VRMs also
pretty fun project I don't know off the
top of my head what this cost but we'll
be talking about that in the review so I
like to kind of build these as blind as
possible when I can quick thoughts I
suppose throw these in here for once
they're all pads far easier on this to
work with then with one I just worked
with the Alpha cool that's not the
slight alpha cool and their ice wolf it
was a fine product but small things here
are a lot better and those two main
small things would just be again quick
release and the thermal pads
we'll see how it cools though I haven't
tested it yet but we've got a lot of
work to do so as always patreon link in
