hardware news episode we actually have
another hardware news episode coming up
shortly because it's on a specific topic
that's under embargo presently this week
that we're talking about a lot of AMD
news talking about New York the state
booting an ISP and we've got some other
items as well including a semi custom
console solution from AMD provided to a
fami clone company as they're known on
the web so all that and more for this
week's Hardware news before that this
video is brought to you by thermal
Grizzly's high-end thermal paste and
liquid metal thermal Grizzly's cryo knot
is an affordable high quality thermal
compound that doesn't face some of the
aging limitations of other pastes on the
market cryo knot has a thermal
conductivity of 12.5 watts per meter
Kelvin focuses on endurance is easy to
spread and isn't electrically conductive
making it safe to use on GPU dies
thermal grizzly also makes conductor not
liquid metal which we've used to drop 20
degrees off some temperatures than our
dee-lighted tests by a tube at the link
in the description below
first of all quick thanks to all of our
supporters as we make our move into a
new office the movies been really
expensive we knew it'd be expensive just
to furnish it and uproot a 10 year old
business and move it somewhere else but
having the patreon support from all of
you who are patreon backers on
patreon.com slash gamers Nexus and the
store support especially has been
tremendous and offsetting a lot of our
costs and making it much less stressful
than it would have been otherwise so
thank you very much for your support and
on that note this shirt I'm wearing now
the GN Graff logo shirt has finally been
restocked after like a month out of
stock so a lot of them in stock on the
store you can get them in tri-blend or
cotton go to store documents access
dotnet to pick up one of our graph logo
shirts using the average 1% and point 1%
bars on the shirt design just like we do
in our graphs and mod bats are going
fast the current round will be gone
pretty soon based on current inventory
levels we've ordered more but there'll
be a little while till they get in so if
you want one order a mod mat soon on the
store first real news item here AMD's
second generation threader purse queues
have been showing up on the web this has
been known for a while but AMD is
looking to launch threader for two in
August this month and several the SKUs
for the second gen have
serviced online and these website was
one of the accidental sources of this
where reddit users discovered several
models for second gen thread Ripper CPUs
on a and these websites including what
appears to be the flagship 32 core 64
thread 2990 WX and also a Canadian
retailer briefly listed this CPU on
their website for roughly eighteen
thirty five dollars USD or thereabouts
so being that AMD has doubled the core
and thread count from the previous
nineteen fifty acts that debuted at
$1000 that price isn't altogether
startling we have independently
confirmed that gamers Nexus that the
twenty nine ninety WX is in fact a
thirty-two core sixty four thread part
so the they're not really rumors anyway
but the leaks that you saw our
legitimate we've also confirmed that its
frequency is 3.0 gigahertz base and 4.2
boost not sure how exif are is working
on this one just yet and pricing should
be about eighteen hundred dollars on
that part just like was seen on that
website so all that information is
accurate we have confirmed it
independently with multiple sources will
post the rest of the information on
embargo list which is August sixth and
technically just like with the rise in
2000 launch we're not really included in
this embargo we're not under embargo for
this product we do have all the
information but just like last time
we're holding it and the remainder of
the news just out of respect for our
peers in the space we'll post our our
news story with everyone else on embargo
lifts and about a day after this video
goes live next news item still Andy Andy
issued a press release stating that
they've worked on a semi custom SOC or
system-on-chip for a Chinese company
Zhongshan sue bore to be sold in a
gaming pc available later this month and
a gaming console later this year so this
is kind of interesting both are going to
use the same hardware the PC and the
console same hardware different
operating systems console will be
available later on and will have a
customized operating system as the
company claims see war is currently most
known for making fami clones or knockoff
Famicom's and knockoff consoles in
general just cheap consoles overall
built-in games but the SRC created for
them by Andy is a pretty significant
step up from that status so this is a
move to use an SRC that will have four
core 8 threads for the CPU running at
3.0 gigahertz peak operating frequency
while the Vega GPU has 24 C use or
compute units each CBC U has 64 stream
processors in it if you want to do that
math but it's basically about half of
what you'd get in a Vega 56 roughly so
they're running up thirteen hundred
megahertz to the GPU it's using eight
gigabytes of gddr5 big change from the
Vega GPUs typically seen with HP M of
course and it makes it competitive on a
hardware level with the ps4 pro and xbox
1x
whether or not that's leverages in the
same way remains to be seen programming
has a lot to do with it the semi custom
SOC uses a 256 bit interface for its
gddr5 memory and includes other vegas
specific features like our PM a rapid
packed math next one asus outs its own z
390 roadmap for intel's upcoming 8 core
launch so an Anandtech reader spotted
that issues had outed at z3 19
motherboards ahead of launch these
boards will support intel's upcoming 8
core cpus likely names the 9900 k and
also likely one of the first to launch
presumably these have a the boards have
a stronger power delivery setup than the
current generation boards out there and
that is a requirement by the new cps the
extra two cores will impact current
requirements quite a bit as you'd expect
a Seuss's list of boards includes some
heavy weights in the rog family that we
don't yet know the specifications on the
boards or if they've actually changed
the vrm on the boards meant for eight
core CPUs so the company aims to ship
its full listing of Maximus 11 boards
ROG Strix boards tough gaming boards and
prime motherboards along with AZ 390
dragon which is meant for the China
market sold probably never seat here in
the US
Asus has already published its BIOS
updates for existing motherboards it to
support eight core CPUs from Intel and
that gives by the way just some lead
time so if you ever wonder why
motherboard vendors push very obvious
BIOS updates ahead of a launch that even
say support for new generation
processors
it's because they have to make sure that
as the channel clears of existing stock
which is doing now the boards that are
getting restocked need to have updates
so that as people invariably buy the new
CPUs hopefully it'll actually work and
they won't need things like boot kits
next news item is a combination of AM
DNA C's so Asus is working on a retrofit
kit for cooling on their ex 399
motherboards this is meant to upgrade
existing ex 399 boards to better support
overclocking on thread refer to which
will have significantly greater power
requirements particularly and primarily
when overclocked Asus is launching 40
millimeter fans at ten millimeter height
for its existing ex 399 boards including
SOC and V core vrm brackets to mount
those fans above the prm's that are on
the motherboards that are already out we
don't yet know if Asus will be working
on any new x 399 motherboards it doesn't
presently look that way but they are
outfitting the existing boards with
optional on request cooling kits if you
did want to put right over to it's one
of those boards an overclock it again
these are on request so they will not be
coming in the boxes for any of the
existing motherboards out there next up
is non AMD and non Asus news but very
interesting this is the state of New
York booting and ISP recently the state
of New York's Public Service Commission
banned ISP charter communications who
operates as spectrum from operating in
the state in 2016 Charter merged with
Time Warner to become the second biggest
ISP in the country the state of New York
approved the merger based on several
contingencies these contingencies
included building the network out to 145
thousand homes and businesses and
underserved and rural areas and
increasing statewide broadband speeds of
100 megabits per second by the end of
2018 at this point perhaps
unsurprisingly to those of us who have
the internet in our homes Charter has
failed to deliver on every performance
metric required in the deal so every
single performance goal failed by
Charter Communications much like
basically everything they ever do so New
York cites a poor track record
fraudulent claims and many instances of
misconduct on a support level in the
decision to revoke their approval of the
2016 merger and subsequently banned
charter from the state charter has been
previously accused of throttling speeds
for Netflix and even league of legends
of all things with a 2017 lawsuit
containing data that demonstrates
decreased internet speeds for League of
Legends players up to the point where
Riot Games paid spectrum for increased
connection speeds
additionally Charter is accused of false
advertising stemming from their failure
to increase internet speeds as promised
and they also continued to advertise
that they were delivering higher speeds
which were not actually available so one
of many offenses charter has 60 days to
design a and file a transition plan with
the states while operating uninterrupted
while a successor is planted in their
place New York has also issued a three
million dollar fine and referred the
case to the state Supreme Court this
isn't strictly hardware news but it does
kind of underpin a pretty serious issue
that affects all of us in the gaming or
just technology audience which is that
internet providers in general need to
have some more competition so a lack of
choice and competition among ISPs as I
can tell you sign in office and getting
Internet in there it's causing problems
in New York action New York's actions
against a massive provider are mostly
unprecedented but definitely warranted
given these considerations thousands of
consumers are still left without knowing
what might happen to their internet
access next if one is P doesn't work out
one might have a second choice but
almost certainly not a third choice of
ISP almost ever in your region unless
they just piggyback off of existing
lines from AT&amp;amp;T or charter so that's
kind of the trouble that we're in and
I'll probably talk about this more as
we've been working on our own Internet
issues with the new office I have quite
a lot to say about that
so we'll probably get into this talk a
bit more fun well I'll save most of but
basically for equivalent speeds an hour
at least two residential you're paying
about ten times or more what you'd pay
in residential for a business line and
actually you don't get any better
service despite them promising that you
often do so I'll talk about that more in
a separate piece but let's move on AMD
back inland here's needed a quick
intermission there and they announced
it's be 450 chips I had a motherboard
announcements this isn't really news at
this point it's been a week but we've
been moving so didn't really talk about
it basically before 50 chipsets out it's
a lower power successor to the be 350
chipset it's got memory profile updates
like X 470 had over X 370 and CPU vrm
specifications are improved on some
boards but clearly not all of them X of
our two supported precision boots
supported all that stuff rise in 2003
supported out-of-the-box and that's more
or less it we have not done any serious
p450 content yet but as we finalize our
move we'll probably get into it just
couldn't get around to it with the
craziness going on right now
last news item for hardware sales NZXT
acquired forge so NDRC announced that
they acquired forge which is a company
known for software capturing and sharing
gameplay footage this is a continued bid
in NZXT stake in software development
something they've really wanted to get
into with cam and later improvements to
cam hopefully and this announcement echo
is the one from Corsair who recently
purchased el gato as you might recall
and is highlighting a trend of PC
hardware makers showing an increased
interest in the streaming market
certainly a good thing NZXT like Corsair
shared few details of their plans but
both NGC and Corsair have undertaken
serious software initiatives on their
own and both need a bit of help on their
own proprietary software NZXT ease cam
and courses IQ would be the most
directly comparable here it could be
that NZXT plans to leverage forges
software expertise to expand their
capabilities with Cam going forward to
potentially include gameplay streaming
and capturing and Corsair could end up
doing the same with IQ or some similar
software so that's it for the news quick
hardware sales notes and these have been
interesting to me as we've been buying a
lot of stuff for the office so Andy is
still purging last gen if you need
some kind of processor and you don't
care if it's the latest and greatest you
just want something that's good and
about a year old and these still got
their rise in 1000 series and as in the
desktop parts and the original threader
for series at purge prices at this point
we would encourage you to wait for
thread or two to launch because we don't
actually know how much of an upgrade
that is it's certainly an upgrade just
like Rison 2 is an upgrade whether or
not it's relevant to you kind of depends
on what you would want to use thread
over for and whether or not the price
differential makes a difference for you
because with threader for one on fire
sale right now depending on the rest of
threader for two's pricing which we'll
talk about in about a day it might still
be a worthwhile purchase if you don't
need the absolute best and you just need
something for like say a video
transcoding box in the corner or
something like that so anyway we'll link
a couple of hardware sales below we also
saw a monitor in algae 34 you see 79 G -
B 34 inch ultra wide monitors 2560 by
1080 144 Hertz and freesync
and that was marked down pretty
significantly at time of filming the
video will link both of those below as
always thank you for watching and again
seriously thank you for supporting us
via patreon
via the Gion store the merch store both
of those avenues have made this move way
more feasible
I mean we're to give you an idea of the
difference the support there means that
we can buy for example all the furniture
that we want to fully furnish the space
from the start rather than buying stuff
later and that means that we can just
immediately be way more efficient than
we are here so that sort of startup
moving process it takes wild movements
it's a long time to get it all set up
but once we're in there it's basically
goes it's pedal to the floor as opposed
to kind of waiting around and buying
more furniture later and interrupting
our process to move more stuff in so
we're getting it all done at once really
like that process and in large part it
is thanks to the support via the store
and patreon anyway subscribe for more as
always thanks for watching go to store
document access net to pick one of these
a freshly restocked shirts or the mod
bat before this rounds gone again they
saw it pretty fast these days
and I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
