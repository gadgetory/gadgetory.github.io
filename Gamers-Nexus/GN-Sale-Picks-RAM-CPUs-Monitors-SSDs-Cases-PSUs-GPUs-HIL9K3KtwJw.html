biggest sale weekend of the year is
coming up I'm not a very good salesman
so what I'm gonna do is point out a
couple of the ones that I think are
actually kind of worth considering and
then tell you why you might not want to
just and you can pick between those two
things and figure out if it's a good fit
for you or not this is not our only
video for today we're putting out a
roundup aswell probably the GP roundup
but figure to put out a quick easy sales
video links will be in the description
below for all the products discussed
along with the article if you prefer a
table layout of those links and yet
we'll pull a couple components from each
category put some timestamps over there
and then you can jump to the category
for which you need products this
coverage is brought to you by ifixit.com
and their protec toolkit I fix it as
refreshing there protec toolkit in time
for the holidays you can find a link in
the description below to the protec
toolkit and other toolkits that iFixit
sells we find the protec and essentials
kits to be the most useful for DIY
enthusiasts between now and November
27th iFixit is offering a free US
domestic shipping for orders over $50
with code fixed the world so plan here
is go over a couple components for each
category we have articles for each of
these already and we're trying to avoid
the sales and air quotes where the
retailer is basically jack up the price
and then drop it so we're trying to
avoid those and look at things that are
actually on sale and there are some
genuinely good ones CPUs surprisingly
have some of the best so we'll start
with in talks already covered AMD full
disclosure here my original plan was to
just have a time stamp that jumps to the
Intel CPU sales section have it be a
black screen and once I come on but the
7700 K is actually on sale which is
something we've never really seen from
Intel before they don't generally put
CPUs on sale so thank you competition
for that it's now $290 for the whole
year it's been 330 to 350 and it's still
a good CPU by all accounts so the 8700 K
is out yes but the 77 heart is not
obsolete and at that price where's the
8700 K it's definitely not obviously
it's still plenty good for gaming it's
not quite as good at produc
8700 K so if you have needs for blender
premiere things like that consider the
ad 700 K but the 7700 is still great and
overclock it because it's way better
that way go to 4.8 - 5.0 for most of
them well 4.8 to 4.9 for most 5.0 if
you're lucky get a decent motherboard
with it and you'll be good to go
this one presently comes with Assassin's
Creed origins in total war Warhammer -
which are actually new and kind of
relevant so that's potentially value-add
for you and other than that for
motherboards we would recommend the
gigabyte gaming 7z 270 board for a
higher-end overclocking board that's
what we use for our GP benchmark rig and
then for something more affordable the
as Roxy 270 extreme 4 is way cheaper
it's fine if you're not doing anything
serious and just put a fan on the
heatsink and ear Aizen so as already
pointed out in our previous content
basically every AM the horizon and
threader for CPU is on sale right now
that includes the 1950 X which is marked
down from $1,000 to 800 that's actually
good it's 20% off so yea it's Lee got
margins there but it's better than what
we normally see for CPUs so that's
actually kind of nice to see for once
Intel and AMD actually on sale 1920 X is
650 these are not for everybody you
should look at our reviews before you go
buy them because the prices are tempting
but if it's not going to serve your
needs you definitely are not saving
money by buying it instead you might
want to look at our 7s are fives i7s for
gaming or lighter workloads for
production definitely the 1950 X is a
good deal right now the r5 1600 got our
overall best value award for the year
that's 190 bucks that's worth it at that
price for sure and more or less replaces
i-5 until low-end motherboards come out
and yeah best CPUs overall r5 1600 r7
1719 50x is worth considering maybe for
motherboards we can recommend the thread
Ripper CPUs going on zenith extreme
although it's expensive or gigabyte X 3
9
ix does ignore e if you want something
cheaper but it's BIOS leaves a lot to be
desired it's still a hundred bucks
cheaper though so those are your pros
and cons cases cases have some actually
good sales this was more exciting than a
lot of the other categories cases have
more margin so it makes sense they have
several of these have won awards over
the last year the fractal mesh fic is
available between 70 and 80 dollars
which is a pretty good markdown it was
90 to 100 before if you can catch it
when it hits 70 it has been going up and
down the last two days if you catch it
at 70 that's a great deal
the fractal define C is also around the
same price markdown similarly if you get
one of them by a fan with either one
it'll be a lot better you can run lower
rpms on two fans in the front or
something and you'll be in better shape
for it so we like those defines he's a
bit warm but it's great build quality
good ease of installation and you can
fix the warmth with fans the next one
the Corsair 270 R we haven't talked
about since January that's now around
$55 marked down from the $70 launch
price this is a case that we've liked
decently at $70 it wasn't as competitive
as it needed to be at 55 it's one of the
best cases in its price tear it hands
down beats a lot of the other $50 cases
like now it just beats them it it like
beats them into the earth because you're
looking at things like the Goong here
which I'm getting PTSD from thinking
about so the 270 R is is potentially
worth considering it's not the best case
in the world but at 55 not bad and then
the NZXT s340
is about $50 after rebate if you count
the rebates if you don't it's a bit more
and then the Rose will : and this is one
of the better ones so we showed this as
a decently cooled case because it has so
many fans it's now priced at 75% off of
its original MSRP they really cut it
down to 75 bucks
it's a Jones bow box but one of the
better ones and is actually a really
good deal at this point so that's worth
considering
next SSDs so we spotted the crucial MX
300 SSDs allegedly marked down to $80
for the 275 gigabyte and marked down to
130 for the 525 gigabyte funny story I
bought both of these about a year ago I
went back to my purchase history looked
at the price and I paid those prices so
they're not actually on sale but they
say they are so we're not gonna have
least of those in the description below
because it's anyway we bought
those previously they're not really on
sale raise the price drop it typical
story what was a little on sale was the
Samsung 850 Pro SATA SSD so bit marked
down the one terabyte unit is presently
$400 for a higher-end SSD for something
more reasonably priced we also saw the
Samsung 850 Evo for 250 gigabytes for
$90 on Amazon and we picked up two of
those for test benches it's decent food
drive motherboards talked about those
already I'll be 350 board a munch and
that so builds Lloyd's video is entirely
about overclocking motherboards for
people who actually overclock meaning
you don't just change the multiplier and
call it an extreme overclock for
something cheaper the asrock pro for
which he gave an honorable mention to i
think is not bad it has the least
terrible vrm heatsink of the be 350
boards and that one is 75 dollars fifty
five if you count rebates so that's
that's good board for be 350 just if
you're actually doing any meaningful
amount of overclocking be careful of
capacitor temperatures because at 105 C
you're looking at two years life five
thousand hours so just get a fan on it
or put a rear exhaust fan on the case or
put an air cooler on the car on the CPU
and an exhaust fan you'll be good to go
with that it's a good price otherwise
though power supplies we saw the EVGA
supernova 650 g2 for $70 after rebate or
85 normally it's one of the better
mid-range power supplies in that price
category right now if you want to so
many dirt cheap that's kind of mediocre
but I'll get the job done for a budget
build the corsair CX 615 on modular
power supplies 50 right now more
down to 40 after a rebate if you count
them it's definitely not a favorite in
the space it's nothing to really be
super proud of but it's fine for
something basic and cheap if you're not
gonna put a ton of load on it so if you
really need something that's the new
idea seems to really be trying to sell
those right now monitor is one of the
better deals we saw was new AG exclusive
unfortunately it's the LG 27 ud5 8p that
be nailed it 27 inch display
that's an IPS panel with native 4k
resolution at 60 Hertz freesync is on
there 5 millisecond gray to gray and
this isn't the fastest response in the
world it's not the best picture quality
in the world but it's decent and at $300
it's hard to complain too much it's an
actual sale it's not one of the fake
ones like that SSD so this is pretty
good price and value overall if you're
trying to get into 4k cheap and
resolution matters more to you than
outright picture quality then this is a
decent option to consider for
entry-level 4k gaming by the way should
start getting more prevalent the next
year I think but I will have GP
recommendations in a minute next monitor
MSI has the optics g27 c2 27 inch
display curved and that's got a 1
millisecond grey to gray freesync 144
hertz refresh unfortunately only 1080p
but it's $240 after an instant promo $10
Mir rebate if you count those Amazon has
it for 250 and for an absolute
dirt-cheap monitor we saw a 1080p
display that was 23 inches 5 millisecond
graded gray for $90 after an instant
promo code and it's got a $10 rebate if
you count those to bring a time to 80 so
not bad still 80 to $90 for a 1080p
display that's not absolutely hated is
worth considering if again you're on an
ultra strict budget or you're just
getting as a PC gaming or something and
if you're just getting into PC gaming
I'm sorry that you chose this year with
memory prices and video card prices
which are next
all right 5 80s so this one is pretty
sad but hear me
out the rx5 80s are now down to MSRP so
242 260 H dollars for an 8 gigabyte
model 200 to 230 for a 4 gigabyte model
typically you'd scoff at that and say
it's MSRP but considering the last six
months of rx 580 prices it's a lot lower
than it was it's like half of what it
was four months ago so if you're trying
to buy one and MSRP is okay with you
they're kind of available at this price
the better 580 s are still $280 like the
gaming extra the Nitro the power color
and the msi armor are available in two
forty to sixty dollar ranges the main
trouble with this is that the VRMs will
run a little warm and comparatively the
fans will be a little bit louder but if
you just care about price and you have
adequate airflow in the case you'll
basically be fine just don't hotbox the
cards definitely consider picking up a
thermal pad in addition for a quick mod
in case there's coil whine on either of
them you can throw the pad on top of the
inductors and there's a decent chance
it'll kill the coil whine not always
though it depends on the components next
110 70's and 1080 is there's technically
a gtx 1080i sc2 gaming for $10 off so
it's 740 instead of 750 if you missed
that sale you're not really missing out
on much I guess we already spending that
much money but Sen dollars off so
somebody considered there's a 1070 mini
car that was kind of interesting good
for an 8 CPC build it's an msi card it's
short and that's $410 so that one's not
bad Ram is the last so we found some Ram
sales now that's it's not joke we like
we found ok it's kind of actually it's
kind of depressing at this point but we
did find some sales on Ram that was
marked down from the price that it's
been for the last eight months so I
think we have a chart of RAM prices if
we get that on the screen and yeah it's
uh well anyway it's better than it was I
guess so
we saw the Corsair Vengeance lpx
16-gigabyte kit 3000 megahertz CL 15
currently available around $160 on
Amazon Ripjaws 5k to buy 8 gigabytes 20
800 megahertz $140 20 bucks for 200
Hertz difference you're not going to
miss it so it's worth saving the money
the RIP draws 5 2 by 16 gigabyte kit for
32 gigabytes total runs at a thirty two
hundred megahertz CL 16 and $300 which
sadly is one of the best prices we've
seen on a memory kit in a long time
comparatively so if you need a big
memory bank for that thread ripper CPU
for example consider the RIP drawers 5
kit 32 gigs 32 hundred megahertz pretty
much what you want for risin three
thousand two thirty two hundred and
three hundred bucks so it's a lot
cheaper than like some of the g.skill
RGB stuff so that's it quick video we
have another video that's in the more
normal format coming out today as well
this is just meant to hopefully help
guide some of the interest and sales
going on right now because there are
some legitimately good ones especially
on the CPU front also a lot of stupid
ones
as always we would advise you to not
panic and buy stuff because you're
trying to get it for the sale ends
research it read the articles if we've
written them or other people watch the
videos and the biggest thing is a lot of
these sales are like they the prices are
not really and never were what the list
price says they just say it was the list
price but in reality it's probably been
like the same price as the sale for the
last five months so consider that as
well you can check on I think PC part
picker has price trends if you want to
make sure that it's not all a lie to try
and get you to buy it quickly but
hopefully I think most of these were
actual sales I did try to look into them
so that's all for this one subscribe for
more will have roundup guides you'll
definitely want to see if you're
building a PC you can go to gamers Nexus
dinette to catch all the articles that
won't make it to the web to the YouTube
channel patreon.com slash gamers and
access we're gonna put a sale on our own
stuff as well so some of the shirts I'll
probably mark down like 5 bucks or
something
so a story doc gamers an access net to
pick up one of those will mark down the
stickers too so you can grab some of
that stuff for a bit cheaper but uh yeah
that's all for this time I'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
