is steve from Cameron's Nexus not that i
am joined by Keegan hello we are on the
last day of pax after 33 days and long
days today we're talking are grey goo
before you leave because that's just
boring and we're running the TV in the
background because they don't need to
know that because they don't need to
know that because friends is on friends
is on we like friends is the only good
thing on TV in this entire state it
isn't it's to be fair friends Ninja
Warrior was on that ended Oh was
replaced today we're talking about thank
you but just made by a great gray box
petroglyph and it is an RTS game yep
three factions made by the reeboks whose
was it westwood and you have former
westwood guys former westwood former Red
Alert command &amp;amp; Conquer yeah yeah three
factions the humans they just called
humans yes Terrans something like that
humans we say Terrance I now I think
blizzard will sue us oh not Terrans
they're humans the betas which I think
are robots and the goo which grey goo GG
we we got to sit down and well we didn't
sit down we were standing and we talked
to Pat we talked to Pat Neely designer
on grey goo we talked to our RTS as a
genre where it has gone why has it
suddenly stopped existing yep and you'll
see all that video on the side won 11 of
mice my side we also got the plague grey
goo now we made the mistake of rolling
random both of us and we both ended up
as the betas we both played random so he
played the same race so unfortunately we
don't have a full perspective on the
game yeah but we did get to play the
game and check out the mechanics it
feels like a real RTS feels very good to
me I enjoyed it it feels more like red
alert than
starcraft you don't have to click on the
buildings to do things nope even though
I kept doing that kind of like the the
westwood the doom game that they made it
like jasm for yes which I enjoyed a lot
Doom was good um you say do more doom
Darren is what I want to say dude is the
game that do it's nothing like doing
doing with the sandworms ya think uh
sting with the stuff on his face Oh
Raghu is a good game he missed a lot of
the game because he only played one race
between the two of us yeah but the
mechanics are good it feels very fluid
the other controls are pretty intuitive
I had there was a bug where I couldn't
scroll the mouse I'd use arrows yeah I
had that too actually wasn't sure if
that was a bug or what but I said it was
a bug because I could scroll left with
the mouse but not right or down okay I
tried to scroll in one direction and I
gave up pretty much instantly and just
use the arrow keys and that was all
right that was fine but other than that
the mechanic see basically you have your
scent as the beta is anyway you have
your central hub and you attach
buildings to that hub yep and you use
refineries to get resources just like a
red alert red alert and all the
commitment cone Holly literally yeah so
you build a refinery send your worker to
go collect it does that on the org well
yeah he does that automatically and then
you can build your military factories
and production buildings you know and a
key aspect for I think that definitely
for the betas but I think for the humans
as well is that all their structures
built off each other you have a central
building that you build off of and then
I think what he said was that the humans
they can only build off of their main
building I know for the beta as they
built off of hubs and if the hub is
destroyed the building becomes an act of
just like a pylon and starcraft yep but
the the hub's are important because you
attach your unit production to them but
then to enhance your production tree you
attach other things to them kind of like
the barracks and your tech labs and
factories
from there you cube production the
factories work independently of each
other so you each factory for units you
want you can build air handlers and air
hangers the air units are cool like
reminded me a lot of mana conquer
general risk Red Alert it basically if
you use MiG's and red alert it's the
same thing the air units are housed on a
pad on the ground they lift off they go
to their mission then they come back and
rebuild their ammo yeah when they were
in a mo although if in this game you
could tell them to keep attacking the
same point they'll expend their ammo
refill and then we'll go back to that
same point and keep attacking I noticed
that when I was beating him it's very
easy to harass which is good I think
that was just my poor planning well I
mean just in terms of the will for the
betas at least the Raptors oh yeah I
called it looks like I think it's called
a raptor it looks like Raptor yeah it's
pretty quick has decent range and
somewhat was decent and this one what
beefed up so do I think some hits good
mid ragey you didn't think pretty quick
um the games didn't take the games
didn't take her along the games we
played in the games I saw being played
were fairly quick I think ours was what
15 20 minutes espier 15 or 20 minutes 42
total complete idiots we had yeah we had
no is that should be emphasized we had
no idea what we were doing I don't think
we need to emphasize it for them it's
like 15 or 20 minutes for us we're
playing kind of slow um yeah trying to
figure things out usually him but after
the after you get used to the hockey
they changed the hotkeys a lot you
basically stay on qwerty oh wait this is
where Ross and Rachel get back together
oh is it yeah cuz they both date a bunch
of people and then she's distracting and
I don't I go on so uh huh that's good to
get edited out oh the queuing is easy
because if you middle button q it'll
just keep making whatever you unit you
tell it to I don't know if that's normal
know how were t-that was it the keys the
hotkeys are designed in a way they think
damn qwerty all the time like a boba and
so you're not moving your hand
the keyboard they emphasized Pat the
lead designer emphasized that they
really want to have a broader appeal
with an RTS they don't like that he
didn't name names but he was talking
about starcraft three obviously yep when
he said that a lot of RTS games have
gotten so complex that they are
intimidating you have a lot of players
and I didn't find this game intimidating
it was there were definitely things we
didn't know to do at first but still a
lot of things came together pretty
quickly we both progress most of the way
through the tech tree I don't think
either of us built the the real heavy
evidence no but um without health units
as well but I couldn't figure out how to
make them ever yeah oh yeah guess I lied
I was trying to make them and then I can
figure out how and then I solved the
structure made planes instead I'm a
complete liar no idea what's going on at
this game so Greg is interesting if you
like RTS that it's very similar to Red
Alert in how it feels and plays yep it
was like a throwback for me but not so
much like Starcraft throwback in a good
way in a good way yeah cuz readily God's
good got all the good parts right yeah
so if you understand that's that type of
RTS as always links in the description
below for more I think they said they
were launching in september-october
hooking back together and do i'll
publish the full date in the article yep
and we will see you all next time peace
good look that 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
