hardware news recap for the week we just
got back from LTX so a couple big items
this week including msi accidentally
suggesting that AMD could be moving to
higher core accounts verizon beyond
eight core these e3 70 BIOS updates that
look to have support for eight core CPUs
going forward from Intel and then PC
sales growing for the first time in six
years which is a bit different from the
enthusiast market which has continued to
grow over that period but the PC desktop
market has definitely overall been in a
slump but not for this quarter
apparently so we'll be talking about
that and more today before that this
video is brought to you by EVGA is 19th
anniversary giveaway EVGA is giving away
over $80,000 of components and it's
retro themed at nineteen year
anniversary including two signed GN mod
mats and also several full systems GPUs
motherboards and more to participate
click the link in the description below
to start EVGA scavenger hunt screenshot
competition or gaming events click the
link below to learn more there's a
couple GN items first the mod mats are
finally shipping and we've had a good
amount of pre-orders from you all for
the last class or backorders at this
point and start shipping those out so if
you haven't gotten a shipping
notification yet you'll get one soon
they're on the way if you want to buy
one you haven't yet it will ship when
you order it at this point so they're in
stock at least for a while hopefully we
can hang on to a bit longer than last
time but super popular item thank you
for supporting the mod mats if you don't
know what it is it's on stored on
Cameron's Nexus Don that it's a four by
two-foot modding and building service
for PCs pretty high quality rubber and
print on it as well so those are back in
finally and then another quick to
announcements we have new posters that's
what this is right here and these are
standard size posters there on stored I
Karen exit on that as well it's a video
card PCB with labeling on it for
different vrm components stuff like that
if you want some wall art and then also
this shirt I'm wearing is a black
version of the blue print shirt we have
so I guess we'll just call it the
chalkboard shirt or something like the
Hat same design that just on black now
because some folks wanted that if you do
prefer a blue shirt we have it still
alright first real news item all that's
on stored at games nexus dotnet first
real news item
is fake phases on B 450 motherboards so
this comes from build Zorich from
actually hardcore overclocking builds or
does some work for us on this channel as
well mostly PCB analysis videos and
build soit recently I don't know if he
posted his video yet I think he did but
he's got a video going up we're already
up about gigabytes newbie 450
motherboard that we also just got in
after LTX and built I discussed how
marketing is beginning to further blur
the lines between what a phase is so
phases and a vrm you'll typically see
motherboards talk actually this poster
lays a couple out pretty cleanly but
phases you might hear twelve plus
something or something like that or
eight plus 1/8 plus two and that eight
the first part of that before the plus
is either going to be a true phases or
it might be four that are doubled and
doubling schemes are pretty common at
this point so it is a stretch of the
definition of a phase but it's not as
big of a stretch
that's what gigabyte is doing on the B
450 board so what's going on here
typically a phase would be defined as a
driver a high side MOSFET a low side
MOSFET and an inductor or a choke if you
prefer and then it's got a its own PWM
signal out of a out of phase with the
signal from other phases so that is the
sort of core definition of what a phase
is beyond that we've seen boards in the
past and recently that do doubling
schemes so in these instances they add a
component called doubler and the doubler
is working instead of between one
component beeps they're working with two
high side feds to low side feds to
chokes and then a single driver so this
would be called two phases by most
modern motherboard manufacturers video
card manufacturers so you have two of
everything except one driver and it just
switches and so that gets you what they
call two phase is a doubled phase though
and actually we have that Illustrated
here where these would be your doublers
on this side and those control two of
these fats each so you've got a doubling
scheme laid out in that example what
gigabyte is doing just to try to catch
someone up to speed here so a gigabytes
doing is gigabyte has axed one of its
high side MOSFETs
this is on the B 450 board resulting in
one high side to low side two and
doctors and one driver and that makes
the motherboard look like an eight
phase-- when you look at it it looks
like an eight phase-- for all intents
and purposes when you're trying to
compare boards visually it'll look the
same as any other eight phase-- but
gigabyte is marketing it as an eight
phase-- board and it's really not by the
definition that everyone's used to so
this is ultimately the problem high side
MOSFETs are responsible for switching
the 12 volt rail and so they reduce to
one MOSFET with this gigabyte board
which reduces the efficiency and it
increases the heat and the power load
per phase because you're working with
one of those fats not where you used to
have to for the high side and overall
its operational efficiency is just down
as a result but it's still called two
phases even though it's not even by the
sort of stretch double the definition of
a phase so the board just still works we
don't have a problem overall with a
lower and board reducing the phase count
it's just we'd like to see it done in a
a fashion that is that conforms with
these standard definitions of what a
phase is so it is less deceptive whether
intentional or unintentional that's how
it comes across it's kind of deceptive
and and that's the problem we have with
it and I believe the primary problem
build Zoid had with it although he's got
something like a 50 minute video talking
about all the other stuff about the
board so the marketing is the problem
here changing a well-known definition to
further stretch it into something that
isn't really the definition of a phase
is the issue and it's something that we
think definitely deserves the call-out
and you can check out our colleague
build Zoids channel for more information
on this the link for his video will be
in the show notes if it's live where you
actually hardcore overclocked in the
youtube channel let's check it out so
that's the recap of the builds ode and B
450 video if you hadn't seen it yet
hopefully that kids have been up to
speed and then check his out for more
information next one there's an MSI ad
circulating around I think it was
actually removed by homicide because the
ad suggested that an D could be
increasing the core count Verizon so the
removal of the video of course lends
some credibility to the discussion
online and this video or ad from Amazon
could possibly allude to am the
increasing the core account beyond eight
for the next horizon CPUs and that is
because MSI promotes its new be 450
motherboard design specifically having a
new feature called core boost on that
board which reads quote enhanced layout
and digital power design for eight core
and up CPUs and up being the key word
their key phrase so take this with a
grain of salt obviously make of it what
you will but if we're going to see AMD
bringing more than eight cores to
mainstream and we would expect it at
some point they do it with thread Ripper
so if we see it on their mainstream rise
in parts at some point it'll probably be
rising to rather than the risin or the
it'll probably n to excuse me as opposed
to rise in two which is already out so
there's rise in 2000 series on Zen plus
and then there will be Zen to eventually
with rise in something we don't know
what the name will be yet so Zen 2 is
probably what we'll see 8 plus cores
going on to 16 maybe in the mainstream
that will be launched in 2019 and that's
potentially where we'll see MSI's ad
come to life if if they were
accidentally alluding to something that
shouldn't have been said yet next up
Google slapped with a 5 billion dollar
fine by the EU and EU Commission so
Google's been hit with a record-setting
5 billion dollar fine stemming from
allegations by the European Commission
that Google has abused their market
dominance the European Commission claims
the key areas of this suit are as
follows illegally tying chrome and
search into the operating system
blocking phone makers from creating
devices running Forex versions of
Android quote made payments to certain
large manufacturers and mobile network
operators and quote to exclusively
bundle the Google Search app on handsets
and according to the verge the EU
Commission has given Google 90 days to
comply with their decision that Google
must stop forcing manufacturers to
pre-installed chrome and Google search
in order to offer Google Play stop
preventing phone makers from using
forked versions of Android and cease
illegal payments for app bundling for
their part google intends to appeal the
decision which means that this will
likely result in a year's lawn back and
forth between
and the European Commission this isn't
the first time that Google has been hit
with fines by the EU they were
previously buying 2.7 billion dollars in
2017 for allegedly manipulating search
results the EU Commission is no stranger
to saddling tech companies with massive
fines either they previously did this
for antitrust fines on Apple Microsoft
Facebook and Intel as many of you are
familiar with so Google's got a lot to
pay up but they will be appealing so be
well we'll be looking forward to hearing
about this one over the next several
years probably as it goes through the
court system a couple more times and
gets recycled as Google tries to bring
down the fine
there were new Z 370 BIOS updates
recently that looked to be priming
motherboards for the new series of Intel
CPUs the ninth generation or
realistically the eighth generation
dubbed the 9000 series because it's
still coffee League so it's not really a
new generation but the z3 is how many
boards from vendors including Asus
asrock and msi have rolled out BIOS
updates that seems to be priming for
these 9000 series 8th gen chips and in
the version notes msi for example listed
support for new generation cpu in their
BIOS update other vendors were a bit
more braggadocious and listed support
for quote latest Intel 8th gen CPU and
the new BIOS updates also come with
important micro code revisions that
reinforce CPUs against newer Spectre
variants there have been several new
variants of the spectre exploit and
attack factors if you've forgotten about
those we haven't covered too many of
them that we did hit a few of them and
in the time that those have been
discovered obviously several new updates
have been made to micro code so if you
stopped updating BIOS and you think that
you might be exposed to Spectre or other
vulnerabilities in a way that is
compromising or important for example if
you're a business it might be worth
going through an updating BIOS another
couple times as they continue to roll
those out just because they are still
including micro code updates and other
updates against the attack vectors PC
sales drawing for the first time in
several years during second quarter of
2018 so during the second quarter of
this year worldwide PC shipments
totalled 62 point 1 million units
marking a new
six-year growth trend for the PC segment
this is the most quarterly PC growth
since 2012 and it appears to be driven
by dropping GP prices and strong
business demand in the present quarter
another IDC report indicates increases
over Gartner's report and according to
IDC second quarter 2018 PC shipments
totalled 62 point three million I do see
it tributes this growth however - not
just business demand but more
traditional pcs like the high-end or
premium notebooks and gaming PC's by all
accounts a large contributor was the
final Enterprise shift to Windows 10
which has taken a while of course and
commercial refreshing of systems as
Windows 10 has matured IDC still notes
quote growing consumer demand for gaming
systems as a positive catalyst for
growth and then separately the
enthusiast market that we occupy has
continued to grow over the last several
years so it didn't hit the same
stagnation that traditional desktop PCs
hit where a lot of average consumers not
in our audience would eat by a desktop
and use it for really just browsing or
something like that they've now replaced
those mostly with things like phones and
laptops but that trend looks to have
slightly reversed for this quarter in
the very least moving on just a couple
of interesting news items one of which
is Intel and micron parting ways but the
one will hit first is Corsair and
respect o 6 RGB case quarters are
offering an RGB variant of their spec oh
six case unambiguously dubs wait for it
the spec o 6rg be the case carries a ten
dollar premium over its predecessor and
as our gb lighting behind the front
panel with a built-in controller for
varying speeds colors and effects so the
RGB aside the chassis remains basically
the same to the rest of the spec series
the spec series by and large has been
somewhat plagued with thermal issues and
poor ventilation overall it's not our
favorite series of cases from Corsair
generally speaking the spec originally
when it first launched was meant for the
Asia market and did well there is
brought over to the US and Western
market later where it now is continuing
to get refreshes and updates if you're
in the market for a case that's about
this price at 90 bucks the spec o6 is
beaten by most other things on the
market so there are a lot of really good
options at $90 including
coarse hair like the 400 see and
although a bit more expensive the 600
see which we would far superior to the
speck Oh 6 so even within coarser zone
lineup we'd recommend there are other
cases or the spectro 6 but if you like
the look of this one and you can deal
with it I guess
it's out now so next one Intel and
micron parting ways on 3d crosspoint
after 2019 this is a pretty big news
item so in a press release from Intel
the company announced that after 2019
the joint memory venture between Intel
and micron will cease to exist in town
micron announced their joint partnership
to develop non-volatile memory
technology in 2015 or the first
generation rolling out in 2017 you may
remember obtained that leverages 3d
crosspoint technology the partnership
will see both companies code about the
second generation of 3d crosspoint but
beyond that each company will be on
their own for their third generation
iteration of the technology assumingly
allowing Intel and micron to focus on
their own business needs for product
roadmaps going forward just to note
though both companies have had their
share of struggles lately Intel's now
famously troubled ten nanometer shrink
and abrupt resignation of their CEO and
micron simultaneously being investigated
by the Chinese government while being
engrossed in legal battles
additionally microns version of 3d
crosspoint quanta X has also been
somewhat underwhelming and what effect
any of this has on the dissolving of the
Intel micron partnership if any is
unknown quick one here mzx T's got power
supplies coming out these are see sonic
made power supplies as specified by NZXT
the PSC's we actually saw them at
Computex but they weren't ready yet so
they're finally coming to market now and
the power supplies are known see sonic
platforms they are 80 plus gold rated
they use the C Sonic focus plus gold
platform and the prices are 125 for the
EE 500 140 for the e 650 and then 150
for the e 850 once we have power supply
testing up and running we'll take a look
at them but that's still a little ways
out at least maybe another month or so
the key feature here is monitoring
software via NZXT it integrates with the
cam software and other cam compatible
products within that eCos
so if you really like cam and the NZXT
kraken series product stuff like that
and this might be interesting to you to
integrate with those other ng XE cam
enabled devices but otherwise we will be
looking at them eventually it just might
be a little while Western Digital is
shutting down one of its larger hard
drive plants in 2019 so WD has announced
the intent to shutter the doors and one
of their factories in Malaysia and it's
a facility that the company has
maintained since 1973 WD intends to
decommission the plant by end of
calendar year 2019 goes without saying
that this comes amidst a decline and
demand for client hard drives and
mechanical storage following the boom of
SSD is especially again in mobile and
notebook units WD still has two plants
remaining that spread out their hard
drive production and also the company
has plans to continue to bolster SSD
production capabilities expand SMT lines
and so forth primarily in other
facilities hardware sales for the week
as always we like to include these
there'll be links in the description
below if you're interested in these
products but the main on we saw for
probably a couple months now we've been
waiting for an andy card to be close
enough to MSRP because that's a sale now
to be included in this segment finally
the msi RX 580 is 230 bucks after rebate
if you count rebates that gets it to 230
or so bringing it a bit under original
MSRP we'll have a link for that below
threader for prices this week TR prices
hit new lows on amazon with the 1950 ex
going for about 700 bucks in the 1920 x
for about six hundred and twenty dollars
and the 1904 300 this precipitates the
threader for to launch if you can wait
it might be worth it just to see what
happens and how good that platform is if
you're actually a serious user of
something like thread ripper but if
you're more of an enthusiast and you
don't mind going with something that
will soon be older technology and
jokingly obsolete then they're good
prices it's just might be worth waiting
around to see what happens at this point
we don't actually know i'm not being coy
it just it might be worth waiting
because the next refresh of Rison for
thread over should be somewhat
significant so those are the sales that
are of note we've mentioned nvidia cards
for a couple weeks now so I figured we'd
show with the
the ones coming down in price on the
Gian side we've restocked basically
everything we restocked the 3d crystal
tear down logos that I have right here
restocks the blue print shirts have the
new black version of the blue print
shirt that we're calling chalkboard have
the new posters have the mod mats in
stock keychains basically everything is
back so if you've been waiting to buy
stuff because everything was out of
stock last few weeks it's back pick it
up before it's out of stock again but
we're gonna try and keep it in a bit
longer this time that said the stuff is
really popular so grab it early if you
want it that's it for this one subscribe
for more go to patreon.com/scishow
gamers Nexus I directly go to store Thai
cameras access net to pick up any of the
many things I just listed as being
restocked subscribe for more as I settle
thanks for watching I'll see you all
