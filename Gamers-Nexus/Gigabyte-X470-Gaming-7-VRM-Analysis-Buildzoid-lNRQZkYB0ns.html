hardcore overclocking here and today
we're gonna be taking a look at the
gigabyte x4 70 horas gaming 7 Wi-Fi for
the rise in 2000 series 2 CPUs as well
technically it can also run the AP use
and it can also run the 1000 series but
you should really only be considering
this board for like the 2000 series I
guess if you're on a bad 1000 series
board upgrading to this would not
actually be a bad idea anyway before we
get into the vrm details here I'm just
gonna point out some overclocking
features that this board has note that
it has many before that this video is
brought to you by thermal takes view 37
case the view 37 focuses on highlighting
custom PC builds with its full panoramic
window and tinted front acrylic and our
thermal testing the view 37 performed
reasonably well when considering its
looks focused build which is partly
thanks to the airflow design and the
removal of a bottom power supply shroud
for a balance of looks and performance
check the link in the description below
for the view 37 there's this Auto OC
button which you should never use
because it's probably gonna load up some
awful really like miserable settings
that are either too much voltage or not
stable because I've never seen one of
these actually work well but the other
OC feature like the actually useful OC
features you do get is a postcode down
here and then these two switches there's
unfortunately no power button no reset
no retry and no safe boot on this
motherboard which makes me really really
sad but for for most users those are
admittedly kind of unnecessary where the
whereas these two are actually really
really handy so these two switches here
is one is BIOS mode so basically this
being a gigabyte motherboard obviously
has a has a dual BIOS implementation you
have a main BIOS and a backup files and
basically the BIOS mode switch allows
you to go between single BIOS and dual
BIOS modes and the reason why you'd want
to go between single BIOS and dual BIOS
is because this sometimes on some Gigot
well yeah on some gigabyte
the board's dual BIOS modes tends to go
derp
it tends to be a little bit buggy it
tends to have issues it sometimes won't
update the secondary BIOS you know you
update your primary and it just refuses
to update the backup so if you ever
screw up your main BIOS oh you're gonna
have to do a BIOS update because it'll
go to the backup and the backup is gonna
be on like a BIOS version that's way too
damn old
other issues include is say you screw up
your memory settings and you fail to
boot a few times in a row the backup
BIOS will randomly decide that it will
overwrite your primary and you know
that's just like it gets kind of old if
you're running you know if you're trying
to do some overclocking that isn't that
that is really tripping up the dual BIOS
implementation because it yeah it
sometimes just does silly things so you
can put the board into single BIOS mode
and what single BIOS mode basically does
is you can be either on this chip or on
this chip the board will not try to
automatically recover for you and so
what do you do if you screw up while
you're in in single BIOS mode well you
have this switch right here which allows
you to choose which biles
so like that is a straight-up BIOS which
so yeah this is a this is a handy
feature to have like the normally I'd be
most boards where it's like I think for
the bare minimum implementation of dual
BIOS you really should just have a
switch and two BIOS chips gigabyte tends
to do the opposite they have two BIOS
chips and a bunch of fancy software and
no switches which you know as I said
tends to kind sometimes get kind of
infuriating because the dual BIOS mode
on some other boards tends to be a
little bit less than intelligent so yeah
that that's a nice feature to have and
then there's the postcode there's no
reset
like there is there's no retry safe boot
power reset or anything clear CMOS is
done by jumper down here that's not the
worst way to do it honestly like I mean
I'd prefer a button but hey at least
it's it's just a jumper and it's down
here easily and accessible enough you do
get some debug quick debug LEDs right
here but I don't see why you'd use them
when you do have the post code so yeah
that pretty much covers the quality of
life features for overclockers on this
motherboard I'd really like that power
button as well as the reset at the very
least but at least there's the you know
manual bios controls which I like I do
appreciate that because I have run into
issues with gigabytes dual BIOS
implementation of implementations a few
times nothing as serious as like
outright breaking a board but I'd you
know not being able to run the board
because the well wasting time waiting
for the BIOS to flash over because the
primary is a little bit screwed up and
the backup decides to just randomly
update it is just not you know the most
pleasant experience so I do appreciate
that they put the BIOS which is on this
one now then let's get to the V RMS
starting with the ones around the CPU
socket which are the most important ones
this L shape right here which I'm not
nailing this L shape right here is your
V core v RM and then next to it you find
the SOC right here so that powers the a
GPU and the SOC portion so I GPU on the
AP use and for the Rison non APU CPUs
this powers the memory controller and
the u.s. like some of the USB ports the
PCIe and all of that this powers the
cores so yeah both of these are
controlled by the International
rectifier ir35 2:01 here and this time
around the three five two zero one is
configured in a 5 + 2 phase
configuration this does technically look
like a 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 phase and it
is marketed as a 10 phase and that's
actually completely fine because
gigabyte does actually have a doubling
scheme you have one doubler up here and
then if you go on to the back of the
board you get a bunch of them along the
back here so you have 5 doublers toad
and these are the dumb kind of doubler
these are international rectifier $35.99
s and these literally just pass the PWM
signal between two phases but at least
you don't have you know at least you
won't ever have two phases turning on at
the same time like some of the not
really doubled the doubling schemes that
a lot of other motherboard manufacturers
like to use especially on low-end
motherboards so this this is this is a
10 phase by the like you know most basic
definition of what a 10 phase would be
this is a 10 phase it's not as good as
if you had a real like you know smart or
doubler or just a straight-up 10 plus 2
phase voltage controller but it is a 10
phase gigabyte can call this a 10 phase
that's fine and then the SOC BRM is just
a straight-up plus 2
there's no doublers for that the power
components themselves are while the
MOSFETs in this case our international
rectifier power stages for the vcore vrm
you are looking at international
rectifier ir35 53s
gigabytes favorite 40 amp power stage
like there is so many motherboards they
put these on but it's just like
literally must have some kind of crazy
discount on these because you like
gigabyte uses these everywhere once you
get past a certain sort of price point
for their motherboards there's
motherboards where they use these for
memory power which is just completely
ridiculous because it's a 40 amp power
stage but nonetheless you know perfectly
good part it reaches peak efficiency at
12.5 amps output and that's kind of a
problem with this 10 phase right here
because well if you're on like a 6 core
or a quad core or you're just not
overclocking this vrm will have to shut
down partially like most of this vrm
should not be running if you're running
at stock settings because it's just
gonna be horrific ly inefficient if
you're running like if you're pushing
like 5 amps through one of these power
stages you're gonna have like the bulk
of the power loss across one of these
power stages at that point is gonna be
the act of turning the power stage on
and off like the
Drive circuit the fir-tree itself will
be the bulk of your power loss and so
basically for light load efficiency this
thing should drop phases like turn off
basically like if you're on a quad core
it should just turn off all of those or
orb like this I'm really not sure which
order they're wired up in but basically
this thing should drop down all the way
to like a four phase four idle or or a
quad core maxed out because they're not
that power-hungry for a six core this
should be running bit low around eight
phase-- like six to eight phase mode and
then if you're on an eight core 2000
series and overclocking it should
actually go into the full 10 phase mode
but otherwise this thing should be just
disabling phases because it's just burnt
wasting power otherwise on just driving
them so that's a kind of an interesting
issue with having a big multi-phase vrm
but obviously the ir35 to zero on does
support that functionality I'm also
pretty sure that gigabyte BIOS actually
allows you to enable and disable like
the number of phases that the board will
run so there should be especially for
like this class of board there should be
a manual override to force the board
into 10 phase mode if you're if you
don't care about vrm efficiency and just
want the you know best voltage
regulation which you obviously get with
more phases rather than top efficiency
anyway let's talk actual power
capabilities so gigabyte has a
ridiculous heat well a real heatsink for
their vrm it's not really that
ridiculous for this this is this is a
real heatsink that's nice to see but
they so they do have the real heatsink
for this VRM but honestly it might not
even be that necessary because rise in
2000 series 8 core is a little bit more
power-hungry than its predecessor you
know the 1000 series but you're still
looking at for the 8 core right if you
go 8 core one point for 2 volts and 4
point 2 gigahertz or you know 4.3 you're
gonna be looking at about a hundred and
25 amps of current coming out of the VRM
which falls right within that peak
efficiency figured
it makes perfect sense why gigabyte went
with this ten phase right here because
they're gonna nail that if you're in on
an eight-core isin doing around four
point two to four point four with max
out v core for that you're gonna be
looking at about 15 watts of heat
dissipation for the entire set of
MOSFETs right here so you know that's
it's nice efficiency right there that's
that's actually really really solid
nothing to complain about there now if
you're on an eight-core first gen and
you're at one point for 2 volts you'll
be looking at about a hundred amps right
you know I'm assuming around 4 gigahertz
you're gonna be looking at around a
hundred amps and that will produce about
12 watts of heat this is also
technically kinda relevant for a 6 core
2000 series like that those figures
right there 6 core 2000 series a
slightly higher clock about 90 amps
instead of a hundred so you'd still be
looking at about you know 10 to 12 watts
of heat now if you're on a 6 core first
gen the vrm will have to start shutting
down phases again for efficiency because
at one point for 2 volts those and you
know 4 gigahertz you're gonna be looking
at about 75 amps of current output for
the vrm which is just way below the
efficiency floor for these power stages
and you're gonna be looking at about 10
watts of heat in 10 phase mode it'll
actually get more efficient if it shuts
down phases and if you're on a quad-core
which would be like an APU or something
one point for 2 volts 4 gigahertz you're
gonna be looking at about 50 amps of
current draw because there's currently
not a 2000 series quad core and at that
point the vrm if you're running 10 phase
mode it will produce 9 watts of heat
which like just looks awful if the vrm
drops into 4 phase mode which should be
pretty much close to peak efficiency for
well it'll be peak efficiency for 50
amps output if it drops into 4 phase
mode it'll drop down to about 6.2 watts
of heat output so basically if you want
to like you should really run this
motherboard with an 8 core because
otherwise most of this vrm will just
turn off and you're not using it so you
you know what waste of waste of
motherboard components if you're on
something less than an eight-core on
this Vic is like seriously it's not
efficient like running a ten phase for
these lower core counts is not efficient
so yeah that's the V curve erm situation
now the SOC vrm is made up of two white
one last figure I forgot to mention if
you had an eight-core on liquid nitrogen
and we're pushing about 1.8 5 volts 5.3
gigahertz or 5.2 I you know I don't have
data for what the 2000 series will
actually hit in terms of frequencies on
a liquid nitrogen yet 5.3 gigahertz
you'd be looking at about 200 amps of
current and about 30 1.2 watts of heat
so there the heatsink might actually
come in useful though with how Rison
runs and how long benchmarks on liquid
nitrogen usually last that heatsink
might turn out to be unnecessary in this
area of the board will probably like
this entire area of the board probably
ends up covered in ice if you run it on
liquid nitrogen so the vrm will be sub
ambient unless you're constantly running
about like running a really really long
benchmark over and over and over again
the board will be covered in ice so yeah
now the SOC vrm different current
figures obviously very different this is
a two-phase design right here and you do
get the power stages there are
international rectifier 35:56 is which
is gigabytes second most favorite power
stage it's a 50 amp part and well
massively overkill if you're on a cpu
Rison and if you're on an APU it should
still be plenty powerful though I don't
really like I don't think putting an APU
in this board is exactly cost-effective
so for a regular risin you'd be looking
at about 1.2 volts - well 1.2 volts SOC
voltage
20 to 30 amps of current which will
produce about 2 to 2.5 watts of heat so
nothing like this would get away with
just past like no heatsink whatsoever
and if you're on an APU you might go to
like 1.25 volts because you do need to
you know for the GPU runs off of that
too and also the SOC might actually have
an upgrade to be more voltage Torrent
learnt but 1.25 volts on that and you'd
be looking at about say 40 to 60 amps of
current depending on what kind of you
know I GPU overclock you have and if
you're running the 2400 G or the 2200 G
and for that you'd be looking at 4 watts
to 6 well about 7 watts of heat output
for the SOC VR I'm so not much so yeah
this is plenty powerful enough as well
like yeah that this VR M is really
really solid it's not the most powerful
one on X 470 but I think going over like
getting anything stronger than this is
probably completely unnecessary for the
rise in 2000 series if you're on ambient
cooling if you're on liquid nitrogen
there might be some justification for a
stronger vrm than this but because you
know you'll be pushing like 200 amps of
current through the V Corps of erm and
then some higher end power stages or
just more phases would actually further
improve efficiency but for daily usage
this this is plenty laughs this is
actually overkill for most CPUs and most
people's over clocks because you'd
really have to hit that one point for 2
volts figure to even like get this VR
I'm into the peak of the efficiency
curve for these power stages so yeah
great job gigabyte on on the on the V
curve erm as well as the SOC interesting
note about these inductors that gigabyte
uses so I actually managed to get the
like this is a useful part number so I
managed to get the datasheet for these
these are from each
so a 10 yeah and that is a like these
guys supply a lot of high-end inductors
you find them on like AMD reference
cards server boards like these are
high-end and so these are rated for 125
degrees centigrade because these are
inductors they run that they can
tolerate stupid high temperatures
similar to MOSFETs really the most
temperature sensitive component in a VRM
is your you know your aluminum polymer
output capacitors and then the little
ceramics into the RM itself though you
can get those in 125 C rated versions as
well you can technically get 125 rated
aluminum polymers as well but those are
really expensive compared to 105 C rated
counterparts anyway the inductor is 125
C you're looking at a average current
capability of about 61 amps so that's
how much current you can push through
these before they start getting steadily
hotter and hotter and hotter and hotter
so this is way beyond what this
motherboard needs to be able to handle
and for saturation current which is
basically where the saturation current
is 70 amps and that is the current level
at which the inductor basically stops
being able to like the magnetic field of
the inductor stops building and it
basically starts turning into a short
circuit so basically if you exceed that
current level the inductor like in a
buck converter application that is
really really bad you really don't want
to hit saturation point but as we kind
of covered rise in 2000 even on liquid
nitrogen should not be going like it
shouldn't be getting anywhere near these
kinds of current figures because you'd
have to be at like to get anywhere near
though that the saturation or even the
you know the average current capability
of these inductors you'd have to be
pushing like 600 amps through this VRM
there is no way a Rison is pulling that
not on an a core anyway so yeah these
are ridiculous overkill from gigabyte
but you know that's that's nice to see
and they do use them on a lot of
high-end boards and I guess they just
have a ton of them so why not use them
on this board as well the capacitors at
least these I'm not sure about these
these look a hell of a lot like a pack
this manufacturer and their Taiwanese
but all of these black you know aluminum
polymers those RFP series and hg cons I
don't know the hours rating because
normally the F P series has like like
this model name right here normally has
the hour writing in it but gigabyte
opted to not have that so these might be
5000 hours they might be 10,000 hours I
really hope that they're not just two
and a half thousand hour capacitors in
black paint though that is technically
possible but yeah these are amici con is
a Japanese capacitor manufacturer and
these are you know as good as it gets
basically from other boards you won't
find anything really better accept other
Nicci cons for higher with higher our
ratings so yeah but these should still
be 5,000 or 10,000 hours rated but I
can't you know find the specifics anyway
that covers the CPU power situation you
got some minor buck converters down here
which I don't know the power levels for
the MOSFETs here are on semiconductor
for C tens for there the voltage
controllers are rich tech RT 8 120 DS so
these two control chips and I'm not sure
home voltage ease what voltages these
generate they should be something like
VDD P as well as some of the PLL
voltages so yeah but this is plently
don't push that much power so I'm not
worried about those for your memory
power you're looking at this
single-phase right here controlled by
yet another RT 8 120 D and the MOSFETs
used here are 4 C 10 ends in the larger
package so that's actually the same
MOSFET so that's on semiconductor
again that's the same MOSFET is this
just different packaging size and you
have to you have one high side fat and
two low sides so the one with the X is a
low side and the end result is that this
memory the RM can push six amps 1.35
volts to your four that's for four
memory sticks cuz DRAM like ddr4 doesn't
pull that like much power at all per
stake and actually this is probably
higher than what you would see at one
point three five volts or even one point
five or maybe even 2 volts like memory
really doesn't use a lot of power and it
doesn't really send its power usage
doesn't even really scale with voltage
so you can crank a lot of voltage into
memory and its power consumption doesn't
really change anyway for six amps one
point three five volts you'd be looking
at about point eight watts of 0.8 watts
of heat for the MOSFETs right here the
controller would obviously add to that
overall power of a power draw figure so
yeah that pretty much covers everything
on this motherboard and there is a clock
gen on this board I'm just not sure
where it is it might be this but when
looking like I can't get a particularly
helpful datasheet for this chip right
here and any mention I've I found of
this is just that it's a clock buffer so
yeah there's there's not really any
details on what exactly it's capable of
doing and that it and actually the only
reference I found for it is referring to
the PCIe Express slots so yeah but the
board is capable of changing VC LK in
BIOS we have tested that so yeah it's uh
this thing is uh this is a solid like
this is a really really solid board
significant upgrade over the previous X
370 gaming seven boards and the gate
while gaming seven case I mean gaming k7
from X 370 as well as the gaming five
it's a significant upgrade over both of
those and really this is like this is a
really solid high-end AM 4x4
seventy bored like there's not really
any complaints I have for it yeah it's
it's it's a good board I'm kind of sad
that it doesn't have the power and reset
buttons but for a daily user this is
quite possibly like this quite possibly
would be the best choice assuming there
isn't something weird going on with the
BIOS so yeah physically this thing is
great for like a daily system very very
well balanced and and with the vrm
heatsink you have you shouldn't even
have to worry about like airflow at all
because that this has a ton of surface
area so yeah very very very solid board
for like a daily build for extreme
overclocking it would really depend on
how the BIOS
well the BIOS situation would also be
very very important so yeah that's it
