thought net and first I'll check out the
new set pretty sweet so today we're
talking about HDMI as an interface
hopefully debunking a couple of myths
answering some questions surrounding
HDMI because it can be a bit confusing
with all the different video interfaces
out there first of all what is HDMI HDMI
is a video interface that can transmit
interestingly
video data can also do audio data and it
can do data data so when I say that I
mean if you have a USB interface on your
device monitor TV or otherwise HDMI is
capable of transmitting receiving data
through the HDMI interface for USB
devices or similar devices HDMI can also
do this for audio if your monitor has
speakers built into it instead of using
a 3.5 millimeter jack you can actually
tell the computer and monitor to
communicate with one another using audio
down the HDMI cable so the main
advantage here is that it makes cabling
a bit simpler if you're using a setup
like that
now HDMI at a more spec level is a 19
pin interface you can see a chart of
that here and the pin out includes a lot
of pins for what's called TMDs lines so
what is TMDs TMDs stands for transition
minimized differential signaling and
what that means is it's a it's a method
for reducing EMI crosstalk things like
that and this is done by taking a signal
splitting it down to lines to wires and
one is positive one is negative at the
end of the line when they are merged
again into one signal there's
effectively a parity check where the
system can look at it say this data is
static data or EMI or interference
impedance crosstalk whatever you want to
call it and does not belong in the
signal and will muddy our resulting
image or audio or what have you
and TMDs takes that looks at it strips
out anything that does not belong and
then you get your cleaner signal so
that's what those do there are three
TMDs channels in HDMI 2.0 which is the
most recent HDMI interface
hdmi 2.0 with three TMDs channels each
one is capable of doing six gigabits per
second so you have an 18 gigabits per
second
6 times 3 total throughput potential on
hdmi 2.0 as an interface for comparison
purposes hdmi 1.4 and 1.4 b which are
among the most prominent interfaces on
the recent market are capable of doing
10 point 2 gigabits per second with a
340 megahertz
pixel clock the hdmi 2.0 pixel clock is
600 megahertz and this is actually
really important for high resolution
gaming and we're going to talk about why
right now to see how useful that 600
megahertz pixel clock is we can do some
basic math take a 4k display as an
example that is 4096 pixels by 2160
pixels you multiply those you get about
eight point eight million pixels give or
take a couple at the end there and eight
point eight million pixels is a lot of
data being transmitted it's doing that
every frame there are 60 frames per
second or 60 Hertz in this case we have
a refresh rate 60 times per second times
eight point eight million equals about
530 million 530 million or five hundred
thirty megahertz fixed within our 600
megahertz budget for the pixel clock on
HDMI 2.0 as an interface so that means
that in this instance we're capable of
transmitting 4k at sixty Hertz which was
the big deal with the HDMI 2.0 launch
now for HDMI 1.4 there is a common
misconception where users perceive that
the interface is capable of transmitting
a 1080p output at 120 Hertz this is true
and not true at the same time so to
clarify things for everyone it is
capable of doing 1080p at 120 Hertz but
only for 3d and that's because it's
cloning the data packet and you're
stacking it for three-dimensional use if
you're doing some kind of 3d vision
setup or similar in this case for 2d use
you're stuck at 60 Hertz 1080p on HDMI
1.4 so then can hdmi 2.0 do 1080p at a
higher frequency like 120 or 140 for
hertz well if we do the math again
on 1080 1920 by 1080 times 60 or times
120 you can see that the pixel rate
actually fits within the allowance the
Headroom provided by the pixel clock and
the throughput potential of the three
TMDs channels however there are a lot of
things in flux here and just because it
fits within that specification doesn't
mean that you're going to get 120 Hertz
144 Hertz on your new monitor so here's
the things to look out for first of all
the video card has to support HDMI 2.0 a
lot of video cards do not support this
including some newer ones the monitor
itself or device whatever the receiving
device is receiving the output from the
video card must not only support HDMI
2.0 but it has to support it at the
frequency and resolution that you desire
so you need to check the manufacturer's
specifications page and see if it's
within the spec one big end important
note you do not need a so-called hdmi
2.0 cable because the cable itself
didn't change and that's something
that's true for a lot of interface
updates where SATA for example SATA uses
the same cable for SATA 3 SATA 2 SATA
one they all perform the same they all
have the same throughput it's just the
interface that matters on the component
and the device through which you are
transmitting your data so hdmi 2.0
cables quote-unquote are not necessary
for setting up an hdmi 2.0 device now in
general it is very uncommon for displays
to support a higher frequency output
using hdmi at any resolution so we
strongly recommend using DisplayPort or
DVI dual link cables for your higher
refresh rate needs when you're gaming
and ultimately HDMI is more of a
consumer interface it's more meant and
was originally built for things like TVs
and viewing things where you don't need
a very high refresh rate generally and
for gaming you're going to want to use
DisplayPort which is still rising gain
market share a rapidly or DVI dual link
and even though DVI feels old at this
point dual link cables which we have
another video
about have a very high throughput
potential and that allows them to do the
higher frequencies like 120 Hertz at
1080 for example to make sure a cable
you buy is actually dual link DVI you
need to check our previous video just
search the channel for DVI you should
find it because the fatter cables are
the ones that are DVI dual link the
skinny or DVI cables are not going to be
dual link even if sometimes they're sold
on Amazon or Newegg as such and the
reason they can get away with calling a
single link DVI cable dual link is
because they'll have the pins in the
header but they're not wired so that
means it's not going to work but that's
another discussion that's in our
previous video as far as HDMI no hdmi
1.4 does not support 120 Hertz without
using 3d so in 2d you don't get 120
Hertz at 1080 that answers that hdmi 2.0
primarily supports higher resolutions
like 4k at 60 and then if you want
anything else you need to very closely
look at your video card and then the
monitor itself must support whatever it
is you're seeking so check on a per
device basis don't just assume that hdmi
2.0 is going to get the job done because
it's not really that simple
when it comes to this particular
interface that is all for this video
hit the patreon link in the post role if
you like this kind of content and help
us out we picked up I think two new
patron backers is our patreon backers
rather in the last couple of days here
so huge thanks to those of you who have
contributed helps us do awesome things
like this right behind me and and stay
independent in our production so that's
all for this time I will see you all
