biggest electronics shows for the
industry of the year maybe next to CES I
wanted to talk about some of the trends
that we saw being set at computex 4 2016
and these are all they're fairly global
but we'll be talking about video cards
motherboards VR and cases for this trend
setting discussion before getting to
that all this coverage for today is
brought to you by roseville and their
new cullinan case so first of all global
trends for the year RGB LEDs are
everywhere they're getting a little bit
ridiculous I don't know how much they
increase cost of some of these
components but we saw RGB LEDs and
motherboards in cases in RAM and fans in
the video cards and peripherals and
everything else that we looked at so RGB
LEDs are all over the place I guess
that's a good thing if you like LED is
otherwise you can get five color leds
because that seems to be the alternative
the cheaper variant is where even an
EVGA is a HP bridge for instance or in
in some of the fans out there the
cheaper alternative seems to be single
color leds or five color leds that just
all tonight and don't have full RGB 18
million color range so that's what we
got for the main global trend now next
of course we'll talk about some of the
way the video cards in the cases that
bleed out from this so the cases all
have LED backlights they all have some
form of LED strips inside for the most
part until you get into the sub one
fifty dollar range and then there's the
five color LED versions so they're only
a few cases we saw this year without any
LEDs at all it seems to be pretty
uncommon at this point other than LEDs
the cases do all still have PSU shrouds
at the low end and that's basically
every case from 60 and up up to 150 or
so paris flight routes still very big
this year five color leds as i said and
then tempered glass has become huge so
rose wells got in their cases in when
Leon Lee and Lee only especially
actually has a lot of tempered glass
silver stones looking into it so thats
everywhere now its that thick paneling
that basically it's just a large sheet
of actual glow
rather than acrylic or clear plastic or
plexiglass so tempered glass is becoming
large vga trends so again RGB LEDs once
you get past the LEDs it seems that one
of the big trends it's way more vrm
phases than actually necessary and this
is especially true because we were only
looking at the nvidia cards because i am
the only just announced the card and
therefore had no aib models present so
speaking to nvidia there were way more
vrm phases than necessary a lot of the
cards are 14 plus three phase and
getting attacked by some kind of local
bug and they a lot of them were also
monstrous terzo attack has a card that's
I don't know why it's as big as it is
but it is and it's probably getting them
attention so that's huge gigabyte has a
giant card the extreme gaming card and
there was the I mean that's really
that's the main trend for the video
cards was LEDs more vrm phases
unnecessary and being large so now
moving on to motherboards same thing RGB
LEDs everywhere if not RGB then single
color the armor has gotten big so ACS
kind of started this trend with their
sabertooth series on their tough line of
motherboards that has continued and now
propagated into all the brands including
stuff from ms i and ii bjs not been
doing it for a bit gigabytes doing it so
even if they don't call it armor it's
basically just shielding everywhere it
doesn't necessarily have a functional
purpose but it does it does just look
kind of different i guess that's the
main reason that's there and wrap things
up so everyone's got VR they're all
dumping tons of money into it there's
going to be a ton of failures in VR
because that's the nature of any
emergent industry and literally every
company that's involved in graphics in
motherboards a lot of them are dumping
money into VR in the very least they're
all getting these VR premium badges and
certifications that may mean nothing in
some instances so that seems to be a bit
more overhyped than maybe it should be
because at the very least it's just
throwing VR onto a product name for the
sake of saying it's a VR so I don't know
that I like that trend but that is one
that's here be our backpacks are here
asus and msi have to be our backpacks
intel did a mock-up previously so those
seem to be on the way and then stupid vr
demos with stupid VR peripherals her
also here so we saw a lot of things like
rowing machines with the VR headsets
attached and a fishing pole the hand
onto the cabling that was a bit
interesting we've seen wingsuit
contraptions there was one demo on the
show floor where a dude was just kind of
in a harness like you might see for
climbing or BASE jumping or something
hanging from a harness looking down at
the show floor had the mask on his head
and the demo was just I think skydiving
or something like that so I I guess it's
kind of an exploration of what VR can do
that's something that less than 1% of 1%
of users will ever have in their home
maybe it's a location-based
entertainment thing that arcades or
maybe just to do demos that are more
than the usual you know square room
demos that we've seen everywhere so
that's another thing is just unnecessary
peripherals thrown in with VR especially
the rowing machine which is massive and
takes up a lot of room so that's the
trends for copy text 2016 some neat
stuff some kind of pointless stuff tons
of lights though that seems to be this
team here for the year all the
architectures are shipping at this point
including broadwell polaris and pascal
and Vagos around the corner so that's a
pretty big year overall but definitely
some silly things as with every trade
