access net and i'm joined by Jason colon
from the drop zone team so you showing
off this new RTS at PAX West 2016 before
getting to drop zone in the coverage
this is brought to you by i buy power
and the new elements gaming PC which has
a large a tempered glass side window and
LEDs in the front and bottom so Jason
what's the top level overview of drops
on what's the basics so the basics are
we wanted to make an RTS that we wanted
to play in the modern day and so we
wanted a game that wouldn't go on for
maybe 10 minutes or maybe an hour and a
half so we said well can we make it in a
finite period of time so in drop zone
the games are 15 minutes long there's a
very clear way to score points the
player with the most points at the end
of 15 minutes wins the game if it goes
in if it's tied at that point it goes
into sudden death overtime first player
to score point wins so the other key
thing is we want to get the feel of an
RTS but we in order to get that time
down we had to strip away the base
building so what we said is well what
have you had a number of units and you
had to really pay attention to all of
them how many would it take to get that
feel of an RTS and we settled on the
number of three so in drop zone you're
going to take three essentially heroes
we call them pilots into the game and
those and when you take those in you as
the player and a 1v1 game have to
control all three finally the other big
thing is those heroes you've actually
defined all of their abilities by the
gear that you put on them so these
aren't sure that we have them sort of
pre-configured you have some default
gear and that's all very viable but you
can go and swap out that gear to totally
change the way they play so it suits
your own style of play right is there is
there an effective drafting in this game
at all and he drafting pre-match or
anything like that yeah so when you go
in each of the players is one be one
you're going to go in and you're going
to choose which of your your pilot's
that you've pre-configured you're going
to bring in and which of your loadouts
so the particular gear configuration
that's kind of the unranked mode we have
a ranked mode will have where you
actually have some trade off you pick
your pilot's and then you pick your
loadouts and don't likely we're probably
going to add some
fans and things like that sure how about
resource management in drop zone so the
real resource in order to level up your
pilot's there are these alien creatures
and these alien hives you go out and you
kill those when you do you get
experience I mean that experience allows
you to level up it's really important
not to fall too far behind the level up
curve it's also when you level up a
pilot that's going to unlock the gear
that you put on them so you've chosen
gear that might be a level 3 ability you
have to go and unlock that and get that
pile it up tall with the level 3 I mean
so it's a really important resource is
someone else can take those those aliens
they can kill them it's a finite
resource they can take the XP or you can
kind of ignore it and do too many other
things and now you're behind the curve
and you're losing team fights what are
the plans for supporting the more
competitive players so I mean I think
the game is pretty I mean our core sort
of game is 1v1 competitive play we're
very competitive group we made it that
way from the beginning as far as all the
eSports things we can't really make it
in eSport but we found that lends itself
very well to it in particularly for
tournaments we've put in it we've got to
put any hooks we can that's supported so
we have a built-in tournament system
that will be rolling out soon 15-minute
matches so you can run a 16-person
tournament in an hour really cool each
evening to say I'm going to play drop
some tournament see how I do so that's
sort of thing we have a ranked play
that's going to get rolled out before
too long until lots of hooks the core
experience is very competitive and
speaking to the core experience what are
some of the core mechanics and gameplay
you got a couple different maps right so
it's different obviously from the mobo
setup but on those maps what's going on
we saw one with
mind the gap to tell people about that
yeah so mind the gap is one that I think
new players find it a little bit hard to
deal with and people tend to stay on
their sides but it's one where it's got
a big divide down the middle and then
you've got these jump pads it only go
one way but people have been playing a
while love it and there's a lot of
interplay because you can quickly get
onto the other side harass the player
and then you come down and you jump back
the other map that were showing you is
kind of a more vanilla our initial map
where things are laid out more than a
grid and so whenever we have these
interesting elements we try to put them
in the map or into the gear and not
change the core gameplay too much right
and the core gameplay as we were saying
earlier it's basically collect points
within the time limit 15 minutes
whoever's got the most wins we talk
about a few other ways to get points
what about the rest so destroying aliens
you pick up the object trip prints of
the uplink yeah so the basic way you
score and we actually we called the game
sports ball when we were first doing it
because we were like well let's sort of
take that analogy and see how far we can
run with it so basically what you're
doing is you're going around and finding
these hives when you kill the hives they
have these these sort of alien energy
artifacts which are these cores you they
draw up on the ground you can then right
click on them with one of your one of
your pilot's they'll put them on their
back you then take them to the center to
the uplink you right click on that you
get a channel ability the core goes away
in your score points so you can think of
it I mean simply as the ball the hoop so
the basic mechanic is really clear and
that's how you're going to score points
the other way you can score with what we
call math objectives so these randomly
rotate as you go and you see them in
draft and they're tied to the map so
what happens is the first player to
achieve each of those objectives gets
the points so for example there these
vision towers spread around the map and
when you capture one of those vision
towers you get this big cone of vision
vision is really important in the game
that's one of the things we wanted to
get back from RTS games it's a sense of
map control so that alone is important
but for that objective total vision the
first player to control all four vision
Tower simultaneously gets two points
and those objectives tend to pull the
action a little bit away from the uplink
so if someone's camping the uplink first
of all you can go get experience you can
level up and go kick them off the uplink
and second of all you can go off and
really start getting ahead on these
secondary objectives very cool what
about target released a tentative betas
things like that so we're targeting
either by end of the year or early next
year and that's what we're on track for
for open beta okay where should people
go to learn more please drop zone com
check it out and try to get into the
closed beta very cool so play drop zone
