next astana and once again in the AC
suite I am joined by Nick modjeska Vick
yeah technical marketing specialist at
asu's so we are going to be talking
about some of the terminology and
branding from other boards today I know
about a year ago there were all these LX
le different different suffixes for the
boards and I think a couple of you said
it was kind of confusing it's gotten
simpler now but just break it down for
us real quick what you know what all the
different letters mean sure I'll use the
z87 chipset as an example that watch
launches past summer so is the 87 for
example we'll have the mainstream series
which are the ones with the gold accents
now we'll have z87 - a through K with a
being the top the top end and K being
the bottom end and then from there
you'll move to z87 + Pro and deluxe in
that order and that's the whole
mainstream line that's the with the gold
accents from there we have two other
lines there's the tough line with the
sabre-tooth motherboard that's been out
a few years and then we've also gone
with a micro ATX entry now into the
tough series so we have the Griffin so
we have the z87 sabertooth and Griffin
and that's meant more for heavy usage
all the materials are rated for very
long lasting hours and then from there
we go to the ROG the game the gaming
products right and we now have a new
edition this year in ROG the hero which
is on the lower end of of ROG and then
we have the gene of course and then
depending on whether it's the enthusiast
chipset which would be like LG LJ 2011 X
79 or whether it's z 87 which is right
below it'll be either rampage extreme or
Maximus formula very cool so there you
have it pretty straightforward now and
as always check the link below if you
want some more details some more links
and we will see you all next</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
