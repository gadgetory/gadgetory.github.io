epic chips in the interest of Public
Safety that's one of the quotes related
to a new CTS Labs research paper on an
alleged AMD vulnerability pertaining to
its rise in architecture and it follows
on the heels of meltdown and Specter
reports so the public is now used to
this sort of thing it's another report
that's laid out in a very familiar
fashion to meltdown inspector but we
didn't think things lined up quite right
with it it seems like something's off so
today we'll be exploring the origin of
the report the team behind it and their
background and we'll be talking about
whether or not this is actually a
vulnerability you need to worry about
before that this video is brought to you
by Thermaltake and the view 71 enclosure
the view 71 is a full tower case that's
capable of fitting three video cards and
most configurations it's also one of the
better cooling cases in our recent case
testing bench
lineup the view 71 has hinged a tempered
glass doors on either side that make it
easy to open and show off and it comes
with at least one rain fan though you
can get the RGB version if you prefer
learn more at the link in the
description below so that quote opening
this video is a bit histrionic it's
hyperbolic and it basically is the tone
of the entirety of the paper that cts
lab put out and Viceroy research which
has an interesting hand in all of this
as we'll explore and so what we're
looking at here to get everyone up to
speed this is a we can make a comparison
to meltdown inspector you know about
those this is basically an attempt of a
research company a cyber security
company that was founded last year to
show similar problems on AMD Hardware
there are four categories of exploit
listed the categories are named master
key rise and fall come on guys fallout
and chimera so each has a section in a
white paper that explains the concept of
the vulnerability it's got a list of
affected processors potential
consequences of those at vulnerabilities
alleged vulnerabilities and then
mitigation options as well although the
last section is actually left
empty usually three of the exploits
require quote that an attacker be able
to run a program with local machine
elevated administrator privileges
accessing the secure processor is done
through a vendor supplied driver that is
digitally signed while master key quote
requires an attacker to be able to
reflash the bios with a specially
crafted BIOS update this would
theoretically be done on a remote system
that supports bios flashing from within
the OS one of the experts we spoke with
we sourced a couple of security folks
that we worked with on our meltdown
inspector stories brought them back in
and said what do you all think of this
and for one of them they stated the
obvious if you have local administrator
privileges already and the ability to
flash bios an attacker would be able to
install malware on a PC of any kind
doesn't matter if it's AMD you're just
as vulnerable on Intel it'd be
equivalent to leaving your username and
password on a post-it note on your
monitor someone logging into it and then
you claiming that they used a security
vulnerability to attack the system where
was the vulnerability in the chain
that's not to discredit these findings
but the thing here is that the entire
white paper uses ad hominem attacks and
it goes after the company Andy and its
partners rather than the technology it's
a stark contrast from what we saw with
Google's project zero team and meltdown
inspector where the entire focus was on
technology the worst consequence listed
is quote persistent virtually
undetectable espionage surviving
computer reboots and reinstallation z'
of the operating system that's part of
master key the rise and fall and fall
out exploits could enable an attacker to
break into system management mode using
flaws in the AMD secure OS and epic
bootloader respectively this could in
turn be used to enable BIOS flashing for
the master key exploit which seems to be
the main focus of this paper this is
theoretical as the paper opens with
quote to ensure public safety all
technical details that could be used to
reproduce the vulnerabilities have been
redacted from the document that means no
proofs of concept or sample code and
there's I guess one picture of an epic
system whose
bio screen has been modified via hack to
say leet in the corner yes a research
favor on security vulnerabilities is
using 1337 to demonstrate their hack so
all of this so far is in the white paper
put up by cts at labs but there's more
to it as well get into with Viceroy in a
moment
for now though there's one final exploit
and that's chimera this one has to do
with AMD's use of as media chips and cts
claims that as media eye sees using the
or in the AMD promontory chipset have
quote substandard security and no
mitigations against exploitation it also
states quote they are plagued with
security vulnerabilities in both
firmware and hardware allowing attackers
to run arbitrary code inside of the chip
or to reflash the chip with persistent
malware CTS claims to have successfully
taken advantage of these vulnerabilities
but again it requires a local admin
access and assigned driver will get to
the company's credentials in a moment as
those our suspects but let's start with
the presentation of this vulnerability
by CTS labs contrasting the meltdown
inspector whitepapers the CTS labs white
paper on claimed and the vulnerabilities
is bereft of any example code and is
written with a tone that attacks
companies rather than addressing the
technological flaws that are alleged
this is the most concerning as the
writing is charged and appears
emotionally motivated rather than taking
an approach of objectively outlining the
exploits and detailing the technology a
primary concern is the window of time
provided for AMD for Spectre and
meltdown these affected intel and the
arm basically everybody primarily
Spectre meltdown mostly affecting Intel
or so far entirely so with those two
exploits the CPU and architecture
companies had at least 5 to 6 months of
private notice of the exploits prior to
disclosing them to the public this was
to give the company's Intel and the arm
time enough to supply patches and work
on micro code updates for their
architectures so that the general public
is not exposed to a wide sweeping
zero-day exploit basically so this is
quite different though CTS labs actually
briefed media and we don't know which
outlets yeah because we haven't find
that any any source emails on this but
the from what CTS Labs has put out there
they briefed media first and AMD's
second Andy the maker of the processor
that's affected was given 24 hours of
notice of the finding of this alleged
exploit not enough time to do anything
so in the best interest of the public as
done with meltdown inspector you would
give the company some notice so that
they can do something so the motive here
is suspect that's one of the biggest red
flags even if this is a legitimate
exploit and it may well be despite the
fact that you'd physical access and
might as well just pick up the computer
and leave at that point even if it's a
valid exploit you're still talking about
a window of time of 24 hours to respond
that's kind of absurd so that's what
we've got for the basic presentation of
this now the next thing to look at is
the aggressive writing this report also
focuses on leveraging ad hominem attacks
including from the first three pages of
the report the following quotes one
quote the rise in chipset a core system
component that AMD outsourced to a
Taiwanese chip manufacturer as media is
currently being shipped with exploitable
manufacturer backdoors inside another
quote we note with concern that AMD is
outsourced partner as media is a
subsidiary of Asus tech computer a
company that has recently been penalized
by the Federal Trade Commission for
neglecting security vulnerabilities and
put under mandatory external security
audits for the next 20 years although
important not sure that that's relevant
for this particular story one of the
last two here really puts into
perspective though this one in our
opinion this is from the researchers the
basic nature of these vulnerabilities
amounts to complete disregard of
fundamental security principles this
raises concerning questions regarding
security practices auditing and quality
controls at AMD
and finally for good measure this one
quote and these at latest generation
Vega GPUs which also have secured
processor inside of them are being
integrated as deep learning accelerators
on self-driving cars this is where
you're supposed to be scared because I
suppose the link you draw there is that
the self-driving cars will kill you or
something with her through exploit or
accident so it's very peculiar language
we're not talking about something where
it's a lines of code or proofs of
concept being demonstrated that show the
issues with these supposed security
processor vulnerabilities inside of AMD
CPUs this is ad hominem it is appealing
to emotion it's an attack that looks
more motivated to drive
perhaps investment or the lack thereof
then to drive actual security
advancement of the AMD CPUs and again
that's not to discredit CTS labs
findings these exploits from the experts
we've spoken with do actually appear to
have some basis in reality they could be
real you could actually have security
vulnerabilities and rise in CPUs the
problem is the presentation and the fact
that you need such low level access to
the system basically being next to it in
order to do anything with these exploits
and this is a bit further than what we
saw with specter and meltdown so there's
almost zero focus on technical data in
here and the presentation of the code in
its entirety basically boils down to a
BIOS screen displaying the word leet
this is where things get interesting
as for the CTS Labs website the posted
legal disclaimer has some boilerplate
cya language but also has some
questionable language in one part the
disclaimer states quote the report and
all statements contained herein are
opinions of cts and are not statements
of fact another legal statement notes
although we have a good faith belief in
our analysis and believe it to be
objective and unbiased you're advised
that we may have either directly or
indirectly an economic interest in the
performance of the securities of the
these products are subject to our
reports now some of this just looks like
boilerplate so it's not necessarily a
red flag and in fact again cts could
have found something real but digging
further we get to the more interesting
stuff especially as we move towards
Viceroy
we contacted security experts in the
industry and overall discovered that cts
Labs has not yet been heard of by any of
our contacts we worked with on previous
stories so that's the first item of note
Andy's own statement insinuates similar
unfamiliarity with CTS Labs where the
company says quote we have just received
a report from a company called CTS labs
claiming there are potential security
vulnerabilities related to certain
processors of ours we are actively
investigating and analyzing its findings
this company was previously unknown to
AMD and we find it unusual for a
security firm to publish its research to
the press without providing a reasonable
amount of time for the company to
investigate and address its findings
when we first saw the press release
about this we reached out to the listed
bevel PR contact number this is a
third-party PR agency supposedly that
cts Labs has hired for handling its
contact during this dilemma and when we
reached out to the phone number provided
which also has a name listed on the
press release what we ended up with was
no response the phone goes straight to
voicemail and the inbox is full it's
been a busy day though so perhaps this
is fair we won't show it on screen but
looking through personal social media
pages of employees there we were able to
find that that bevel PR appears to have
been founded in 2017 quite recently and
that it's staffed primarily or entirely
by one individual will go with primarily
we have also reached out to the
individual through other forms of
contact and have thus far received no
response and speaking from experience
we've never heard of bevel PR before but
their webpage does indicate that they
have some experience working with AI
SEOs and hedge funds which led us to the
next part of what we were looking into
CTS Labs is a new company the CTS labs
comm domain name was registered on June
25th 2017 around when the meltdown
exploits were privately revealed to
Intel
and the flaws calm the domain that lists
the exploit whitepaper was registered on
February 22nd of 2018
both are GoDaddy domains there is an
Intel flaws website as well but we
contacted the owner and there's no
affiliation the owner is an individual
and was completely bewildered by our
cold call so we'll rule that one out
CTS Labs lists one urine luke Silberman
as the chief financial officer
we found SEC documents containing
information on Luke Silberman and noted
that he has affiliation supposedly with
nine Wells Capital Management LLC based
on what we saw online on his own profile
and in other documents this is a hedge
fund and investment management firm we
attempted to call the phone numbers that
listed for Luke Silberman on official
government documents but found that the
numbers were disconnected or invalid the
CTS labs at YouTube account was
registered three days ago at time of
filming and presently has disabled
comments on videos the default is
enabled by the way so they were manually
toggled off probably this is where it
gets even better the video is published
by CTS labs are even using Shutterstock
stock photos for their green screen look
familiar
these videos were not shot in real
offices at least not ones owned by CTS
labs unless they're also in the business
of stock photography for shutterstock as
for the logo for CTS labs it appears
that it's using a modified version of a
shutterstock electronic shield logo with
a slightly modified design the company
looks suspect overall it's possible that
this is legitimately a new security firm
it's also possible that because they're
security experts and not designers they
bought and modified some stock images
from Shutterstock perhaps for the video
backgrounds they thought that it looked
better than a white wall or a wood wall
or anything like that and they went with
something from Shutterstock but the
point is that you consider all of this
information with the time of publication
the window of publication and the
verbage and tone used in the documents
upon launch and we have something that
just seems wrong on that note we must
now look to viceroy research
Viceroy was the first group to report in
great detail on the alleged AMD
vulnerability and managed to publish a
25 page PDF almost immediately upon
disclosure of these supposed to exploits
we believe this was pre-written the PDF
is entitled quote AMD the obituary and
seems motivated to inflict fear and
caused damage some quotes state for
instance just one Rison chip could
endanger an entire enterprise network or
another and these flawed chips are
components in defense products just to
scare you one last quote that everyone
can appreciate quote we believe AMD is
worth 0.00 dollars and will have no
choice but to file for chapter 11
bankruptcy in order to effectively deal
with the repercussions of recent
discoveries so at best this is
fear-mongering
at worst and I'm using viceroys own
words here they may have some sort of
financial entanglement with the
situation and again that's their words
I'll read it for you
Viceroy joined business day for an
interview in 2017 when asked by the
magazine what Viceroy is the group
reportedly responded quote we're an
independent research group based in the
u.s. our focus is to research entities
that we find to have signs of accounting
irregularities and potential fraud when
asked why they do this the group stated
quote we take a financial position in
our research and our readers should
assume we have a position on the stock
the group also remains anonymous
according to this business day interview
anyway so if we assume that Viceroy has
a position on an these stock as they've
literally instructed us to do we would
also assume that it's a short position
this is kind of the speculation that's
going on right now so Andy's recent
uptrend would impact that negatively if
you had a short position on AMD and we
aren't making any leaps here Viceroy
literally said to assume that they have
a position on what they're reporting on
so that's what we're doing the ravings
of the Viceroy paper really make them
out to look like a deranged a lunatic
someone one
during the streets at night scrolling
things on the wall pinning up different
newspaper articles and connecting them
with read strain this the paper if you
want something genuinely entertaining to
read but somewhat terrifying we'd
recommend it it's it's a good one so I'm
speaking with multiple security experts
again we have it on good authority that
we've proposed vulnerabilities are
potentially legitimate no one would
commit to it firmly but discussion
generally did indicate that these are
possibly legitimate concerns on the am
the architecture now some of them made
the leap to say you know what if this is
a concern on A&amp;amp;E it's also a concern on
Intel because once someone has your
username password and can flash bios
you're kind of screwed anyway so it's
possible this is actually a problem our
present understanding is that these
vulnerabilities are one not unique to
AMD necessarily and two may require root
access to the host system if everything
we've read in the white papers is as we
perceived it to mean and three they're
blown way out of proportion if they are
legitimate so we have something where
there are potentially legitimate
concerns but the supposed impact of
those concerns has been painted in a way
that makes them look much worse than
reality if they are in fact a concern
the viceroy is the most peculiar element
in all this that paper really really
made them to look like crazy people so
and I mean genuinely like if we try to
remain neutral through this whole thing
that's the one place I can point and say
what the hell are they hot you should
you seriously should look at parts of it
because it's insane so that's it for
this one long story short if you are
worried about this don't be maybe
there's a problem don't give people you
don't trust
Ruta access to your computer and access
to bios you'll probably be fine just a
quick note on Intel before closing out
we've seen some conspiracy theories
online revolving around Intel largely
alleging involvement or suggesting and
of Intel and all of this we messaged
Intel and requested a statement and any
insight to this matter Intel replied
with an official on record statement and
said quote Intel had no involvement in
the CTS labs security advisory so that's
what we've got from them so subscribe
