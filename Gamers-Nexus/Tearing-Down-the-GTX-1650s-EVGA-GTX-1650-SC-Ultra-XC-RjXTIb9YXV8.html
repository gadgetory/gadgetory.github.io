EVGA GTX 1650s both of which have power
connectors this first card is the one we
reviewed so we're gonna take this one
apart it's a dual fan cooler EVGA has
done some new things to bring cost down
both for them and then obviously for the
consumer as well so this is one of the
cheaper dual fan cards EVGA is made in a
while and we're gonna see why that is
what what did they do to get it cheaper
and did EVGA sacrifice anything in the
process of so doing so we're gonna take
this one apart and we just got this one
in today as well which is a single fan
card that's pretty fat it's too it's
it's like three slots for 1650 so that's
what we're gonna look at today and
hopefully we can learn something despite
a lot of people not really particularly
caring about the six pin power connector
1650s but we'll look at it anyway
before that this video is brought to you
by deep pools captain 240 pro
closed-loop liquid cooler the new
captain 240 pro comes with the RGB
illuminated fans and a pump easily
synchronized to each other for color
matching in your system
the captain 240 pro radiator also uses a
unique elastic pressure relief bladder
in the water tank as a leak prevention
mechanism it expands and contracts based
upon liquid temperature to counteract a
IO leak concerns the cooler is available
now and you can learn more at the link
in the description below this is the
EVGA 1650s c ultra it's a 90 watt card
as opposed to 75 watts and will just you
get me a bigger one alright so we're
just gonna take this apart this will be
fast probably this one is the one we
reviewed and it did well like as far as
as as well as a 1650 can do the appeal
of these cards is generally used without
a power connector but this one does have
one at overclock it's pretty darn well
we hit twenty one hundred megahertz sort
of and then 2115 very briefly about how
that 20 85 which is a good place to be
and it's only four screws holding down
the cooler itself evj does put a sticker
covering one of the screws but it is not
a warranty void if removed sticker it's
actually just a tamper sticker so they
can tell if you've if they need to
replace the paste or something when they
are ma it there we go
so very easy to open up and a couple of
things this card that we have is a PBT
model so this is like a test production
run before mass production for consumers
so it doesn't go through some of the
processes that a card you would buy
would go through like some of the
automatic optical inspection or Aoi
machines that we've shown in the past
would catch this issue for example so
there's a quality control issue that
should not make it to production or mass
production because it would be seen by
either a person assembling it or by the
machine but these are more or less hand
built for getting them to the press as
quickly as possible because Nvidia
didn't give anyone enough time for this
product launch so anyway yeah part of
the inductor like cover is missing but
that doesn't affect performance or
anything that's basically irrelevant and
then this is an example of what it
should look like where it's got the full
cap but that cap doesn't do anything
functional that's affecting performance
here it just covers the inductor coil so
the rest of this card pretty simple fan
goes in there you got a big blank area
of PCB but need something they had to
put something there anyway especially
for the fan coverage the heatsink was
gonna be that size EVGA has done some
down cost in unique ways we'll show you
one of those so here is an example of
creative def costing this is an EVGA
1070 you'll notice that the PCIe slot is
fully populated with pins whereas both
of these cards the 1650s are missing
pins and that brings cost down a bit
this pins aren't all that useful with
something that's got the bandwidth of a
1650 are you not high so that's one way
of down costing but otherwise it's it's
really
so it's for one gigabyte memory modules
these are micron memory modules and the
GPU itself we might as well look at so
everyone knows what that looks like
all right good enough there's a GPU so
that is a Tu Tu 117 - 300 - a 1 that
last a one signifies that its production
run product GPU from Nvidia and our
belief is that this is not a full fully
enabled t1 17 so there might be a 1650
ti if they wanted to do one in the
future really depends on if there's
anybody it feels pressure or a reason to
but that's the GPU it's very small we
can measure the die size in a second and
if you want one of these mod maps that
I'm working on these are our mod Maps we
design these so this one's a GPU
teardown mat it's got things like
capacitor labels on the GPU under here
so you can see we've labeled the the
inductors the MOSFETs capacitor is all
that kind of thing I say you can learn
as you go when you do this assembly
projects also protects the service
you're working on and it's got
anti-static grounding that goes actually
to ground unlike some of the products
out there then we have the grid for GPU
screw placement so let's let's measure
the GPU that's on stored out gamers
nexus net if you want to pick up the
medium sized little e back in stock in
the next few days and shipping
immediately you can back order now it'll
ship out or the large size is restocking
as well which is the one under the one
I'm working on
roughly fourteen and a half millimeters
wide roughly fourteen and a half
millimeters tall so the VRMs over here
we have three inductors got the power
stages next to it another inductor over
here ignoring the damaged one and on the
shunt resistor side we so we've got one
chunk resistor right here and one down
here this one will run to the 12 volt
line and the PCIe slot and the shunt
resistor will probably run to this PCIe
connector so if for some reason you
wanted to short these which would raise
your power limit then you could short
this one if you really want to do it
seems a bit odd but that'd be what you
do and if you want to validate this you
just get a multimeter you check the
shunt leg versus the 12 volt line and
that would tell you which one goes to
which power connector and then we do on
these mats if you need it have a GPU
power pin out actually talk about medium
matte as well but there's a six pin and
an eight pin PCIe power right there so
you'd match it to the 12 volt which is
that yellow block and that would tell
you the correct chunk resistor so for
the back of the card there's almost
certainly not anything there but we'll
just take the back plate off anyway give
a J didn't put a metal backplate on this
one it's $20 more than MSRP so that's
part of that cost and I will note that
originally when we took this apart these
three of these screws were loose which
wasn't really that exciting to discover
but like before I got them they release
but it's pre-production it's not mass
production so we'll give EVGA the
benefit of the doubt that that was just
because it didn't go through the same
quality control steps as usual so you
should be good on the consumer side in
theory while we're on that topic too
this was taken apart after the review
was completed all the tests were done
and all the numbers were published so so
this is we don't disassemble before
testing so the back of this is basically
blank there's really nothing going on
here
in fact the GP is pretty obvious
but this card is very straightforward so
we can move on from the PCB and look
instead at the cooler so what's
happening here well this is a cheaper
one as I said it's down costed in a few
ways instead of having a typical
aluminum fin stack EVGA has a black out
matte color still aluminum sort of fin
stack fins are very a few and far
between but they're good enough but
actually this card cool is pretty damn
well so when we overclocked it it was
still in the sixty is the part power
target seems to be about sixty degrees
Celsius so the fans just spin up to meet
that target but the point here is that
it's able to do that with less cooling
solution because that GPUs not really
doing more than 90 watts for the most
part on this card so you can go six
percent above that but 90 watts about
the limit which doesn't really take a
whole lot of cooling power there's a
single heat pipe this is an eight
millimeter heat pipe you can see that
it's a fat cylindrical pipe which is
more effective than the flat ones but
flat ones are often used for GPUs for
surface area or just fitment reasons to
make sure it fits in the smaller spot
but this one is is only squared in some
areas so it's not a not a flat pipe like
you would see on some of the other cards
eight millimeters for that that goes
straight across the middle of the GPU so
you get some contact there
that's your evaporator and then the
liquid will the water pure water will
evaporate go up the pipe condense come
back down capillary action all that
stuff we've described before and then
the cold blade itself is an aluminum
cold plate the copper pipe is soldered
to it and there's a bit of like small
kind of imperfection right here all the
way down it's covered with their own
paste in that area right now but that is
probably a PBT defect as well but either
way it cooled fine for the GPO the
memory is a little bit more concerned
but not that much because this card's
still low end and there's a lot of
airflow above it even though most of it
can't get through the card except right
there but the memory will be a for-sure
a bit hotter than we typically like to
see and that's because there's no direct
contact between the memory and the cold
plate but that does also mean that the
cold plate can
cool and dissipate more of the heat from
the GPU itself so as long as the
memories within spec then it's fine it's
it's not running as hot as the GPU is so
these don't sink directly to the cold
plate is actually we would like to see
some better contact to these for sure
but it's a low-end card and you make cut
corners somewhere and that corner is not
particularly important with the model
like this so let's look at the next one
this is the next one this is the XC
don't think it's called ultra much sure
anymore keep it yeah it does a lot of
different things their names
it's an XC so this card is a three slot
design or basically maybe 2.8 I think
it's no it's three they just committed
to it this time so this is actually
three slots that's good to see him three
slot design single fan it's larger
heatsink will allow it to obviously pull
some more of the heat away without
needing quite as much active cooling
power so it can keep the fan off for a
little bit longer this is the tamper
seal but it's not a warranty void
sticker that's something we've confirmed
a lot it's already loose so only four
screws to get these off which means
there's no base plate once again okay
there's a little closed on the throne
paste at the edges but so anything of
note is this the same PCB yep Oh
actually there's a great comparison
we're talking about that damaged in dr
earlier if you didn't believe me there's
your evidence but again this is just
this card at the top is a mass
production model that's what you would
buy there's a pre-production model so
hopefully that's the only difference
there but either way same PCB same vrm
layout same component placement the
difference is the cooler primarily and
let's just clean off the GPU to see if
there's anything interesting to reveal
but I don't think there will be so still
tu 117 300 a1
nothing new there it's still made in
Taiwan yes sir they both in Taiwan
they're both made in Taiwan so that's
gonna be TSMC and then this one has four
micron modules as well so it's all the
same no back plate for this model and
then the cooler is very fat so there's
the aluminum heatsink versus the two
slot card with two fans this one does
not have the heat pipe in it and still
doesn't contact the memory but it does
have a bigger aluminum fin stack it's
just that these I mean this is typically
this is what you see on these lower end
cards where instead of like a proper
aluminum heatsink like maybe this one
would have for example right there where
the fins are either this way or that way
instead of a proper big aluminum
heatsink like that with heat pipes
inside of it you know with just the
aluminum heatsink with no heat pipes in
it and they just do black out so it
looks a bit better but that's the design
on that one one fan the assembly is
pretty straightforward if you wanted to
disassemble it to replace the fan you
would pull these screws out actually I
don't think you even need to do that
there's a screw right down here so
there's a screw there there and over
here
you can pull those out and replace the
fan and then the cable would just be
routed out through these channels and
then you can separate the shroud from
the heatsink by disconnecting the screws
right there so that is the XC and the
other one is the SC ultra so that's the
two EVGA 1650s that we have we're
probably not going to look into sixteen
fifties too much further
they're not particularly interesting
there's not a lot to learn because we
already know the architecture at this
point so it's just a matter of maybe
looking at a 75 watt model if we get one
but it's not a very high priority for us
but that's the two EVGA cards if you
