nexus donna and we are here at CES 2014
with bob stewart and rod rosenberg once
again you've seen them in our pax prime
video looking at the roseville throne
industrial mod now we're looking at a
new hyper x mod that that's it's pretty
cool it's all custom so Bob how did a
Kingston actually approached you for
this we had talked to them about
creating their own mod because generally
companies who don't make cases they have
to go to somebody else and see if they
can get a case from them and do some
different things but we thought we could
create something that would be unique to
them and that they could take around and
show off and be really proud of so we
had to think of something that would fit
and their new logo is the X you know
kind of the square X with the blue
colors to it and so we created something
that basically was built around that so
and rod I know you you've done a lot of
the machine work in the past what went
into this one so this one one of the
challenges was getting the concept from
Bob's head over a hunt to a 3d design so
we had our friend Acura help us out and
draw it up for us and go through a
couple revs of the design and try to
make sure everything was a fit in place
and then got it exported and onto a
machine and cut right over New Year's
where there were there any challenges
this time with the metalwork or was it
pretty straight forward it was pretty
straight forward we didn't scrap any
parts we only had what the two pieces of
material so we we couldn't afford that
but yeah we didn't run into anything
major a bob any easter eggs on this one
or any easter eggs on the other ones
we're looking at this week yeah there
were a lot of easter eggs everywhere
that you probably didn't see so we we
haven't divulged what all of our cases
have so at some point we may
makes some sort of a contest out of it
or something and see who maybe has
spotted them in the past or something
like that or come up with some way that
we can make a game out of it or
something but yeah we always incorporate
an easter egg in each build and and so
it's kind of our little secret for now
for for this case what were some of the
some of the finer details when when
working with the metal you know can you
tell us a bit about the process going
into this sure so one of the things that
was challenging was we had three eighths
in pedal and we cut out did a quarter
inch so we had an eighth of an inch left
and that's where we had to attach the
case each side of the case together and
we used five eight 11 threaded set
screws to put together in bolts and so
with that thread it means we got one
thread turn in that and so that had to
be done just right and we have eight
pieces so we don't pull thread out any
time it gets moved what's the it looks
pretty big what's the weight of the case
well if you're just moving it it's
pretty light but here at Caesar's Palace
when we had to walk three miles from the
parking garage it felt like it was about
a thousand pounds so I think it's
probably only what maybe 40 pounds or so
no but yeah it got heavy fast you know
on that long walk so we brought wheels
back so when we haul it out of here
we're attaching wheels to it and then
we're going to roll it out so just a
quick shout Here I know you guys have a
new mod shop online since our last video
but a couple cool lighting things on
there I actually covered them in an
article for a for a buyer's guide for
enthusiasts so check out BS mods comm
check out some of their other work I'll
have an a data video online as well with
with some other work that Bob and rod
have done and uh yeah once again thanks
and we will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
