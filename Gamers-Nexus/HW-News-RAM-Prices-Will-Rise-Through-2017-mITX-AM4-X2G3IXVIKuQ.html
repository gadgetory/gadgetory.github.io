hardware news from the past week or so a
few items here first of all thank you to
grants one of our readers and viewers
for loaning us to tighten XP that we'll
be working on this week be sure to
subscribe and check back for that we're
doing a couple of mods on it and a
review but beyond that the news for the
past week we've got some information on
Intel and its discontinuation of IDF
we'll be talking about rising DRAM and
ddr4 prices yes they continue to rise
and will continue to do so through the
year and then we have some video card
announcements launches new monitors
flashing the 400 series stuff like that
to go over for releases and news the
past week before getting to that this
video is brought to you by the current
bundle on the gtx 1060 and VTX 1080
video cards where you can get Ghost
Recon wildlands or for honor at checkout
this comes alongside new MSRP is for the
GTX 10 80 series cards now down to $500
you can learn more at the link in the
description below let's start off with
ddr4 prices since everyone's kind of
thinking about that right now especially
with Rison and its actual advantages
from faster DRAM it's becoming more
noticeable that the prices are rising
it's not just ddr4 ddr3 is going up too
and the primary reason is because there
are really only three suppliers for the
actual memory that is sold to Corsair
Kingston g.skill anyone else you can
think of they're only three actual
primary suppliers and two of them Samson
and micron are currently experiencing
with new process so they're looking at
18 and 17 nanometer options and because
they're spending that R&amp;amp;D effort that
means that there's less actual
production for market consumption so
that means with lower supply because
they're investing in R&amp;amp;D and one that's
there's a yield problem so you lose more
of your wafers trying to develop this
lower this smaller process stuff and -
it just takes time to do so because of
that DRAM exchange and trend force are
estimating that ddr4 prices will
continue to rise perhaps - 2017 and
they're predicting an incremental rise
on what's already how much it's already
increased plus 12.5% so we're looking at
another 12.5 percent increase in price
at least through the
here there's no real end in sight right
now it could carry on it's it's going to
carry through second quarter for sure
2017 might carry on throughout the rest
of 2017 and then once Samsung and micron
start pumping more product into the
market things should recover a bit but
for now it is still increasing if you
have not been following too closely
beyond the ddr4 stuff ddr3 is gone up a
bit too though people aren't buying that
too much now we were looking at some of
our own kits we've purchased in the past
couple years and just looking at ddr4 we
bought a kit in 2016 it was a g.skill
kit that was twenty four hundred
megahertz ddr4 and 16 gigabytes a 2x8
and that at the time was eighty one
dollars 2016 February and now today the
same kit is one hundred thirty-two
dollars to about a 60% increase year
over year and then previously we had
another one about in 2016 that was ddr3
now that's kind of going up anyway just
because it's there's less of it being
made but g.skill 1866 megahertz 16
gigabytes ddr3 it was $65 it is now a
hundred and ten dollars that's another
65 70 percent increase and then you've
got even older stuff like Ripjaws 2x4
kits that have increased about 34
percent or so so yeah DRAM is definitely
going up in price this is if you have it
and you don't need to buy stuff for new
build projects keep using what you have
and run with it otherwise good luck to
you so another quick news item here this
one is on the industry side Intel Castle
that's IDF for Intel Developer Forum
2017 conference this conference is been
around for quite a while now so IDF is
not only cancelled this year it is
suspended indefinitely at this point and
that's for a few reasons
Intel says it's shifting into a more
data-driven market that's kind of
something we can actually observe as
well and so on that front they are
hoping to push other events like Intel
technology and manufacturing day and
artificial intelligence day rather than
IDF and IDF has kind of become less of a
developer for m1 and more of just a
bunch of random technology so it
has kind of lost its way it does kind of
seem like it was time to retire it but
now it's kind of weird timing given
rising it makes Intel look like they
think there's a problem whether or not
they do so just from a we'll use the
word the keyword optics standpoint it's
not a great look but IDF has canceled
indefinitely
there are replacements but they are on
the front of AI data center stuff and
things that generally on our side of the
industry we don't pay attention to that
interests you they have stuff out there
still but they do look like they're
moving more towards internet of things
obtained data center artificial
intelligence and away from some of the
the other technologies that were
discussed at IDF and speaking of Rison
from Andy they also pushed their new
Polaris refresh so if you haven't
followed our rx 500 series reviews we've
reviewed the 580 the 570 and have not
done a 580 plus 480 crossfire it does
actually work if you're curious the
cards are basically an update to BIOS
and more mature silicon so there's
nothing special here if you didn't
already own Polaris this is a bit faster
but more power consumption not going to
go through the whole thing because that
reviews do that you can check the
reviews if you haven't followed it
closely the Refresh is sort of similar
to the 300 versus 200 series where you
get a bump in performance although the
200 and 300 series had a couple of
confusing things if anyone remembers I
believe Tahiti Tonga and Hawaii all
coexisted somewhat roughly within the
same timeframe so that was a bit more
confusing on today but that launched and
then elsewhere in graphics there's the
new corsair and msi hydra graphics card
i'ma cycle the Seahawk Corsair calls a
Hydra graphics it's the same thing just
Corsairs can only be sold through
coarser calm so that Seahawk is out for
the 1080i we're going to be asking for
one to review if I'm alone at least and
that will be priced at $800 so it's one
of the most expensive 1080p is probably
EVGA hybrid if they make one would be
around the same price point we like to
do a head the heads with those so be
sure to check back but that's a GP 102
just like the rest of the 1080i devices
and it's using
a coarser m120 pro led fan this time so
the fan is a bit different I think from
the previous Seahawk series we looked at
and that's still on a 120 millimeter
radiator they're using a maglev bearing
so it is a bit better of a fan and some
of the price increase as for the speeds
the stock speeds are configurable via
three modes there's silent which is 1480
base and 1582 boost game in which is
1493 and 1607 base and boost and OC mode
which is 15:06 and 1620 base and boosts
you can see Emma size influence there on
the card memory speed runs at 11,000 16
megahertz for both silent and gaming
mode and OC mode boosts it up to 11,000
124 megahertz there's also been talk of
flashing the 400 series cards into 500
series cards it's not necessarily worth
it you could certainly do it though and
the gains may be worth it to you is it's
kind of a personal thing really but if
you wanted to flash the devices just to
clear this up
you want to use ideally a bios that was
built for the same card so if you're
trying to move something like an MSI
gaming X 482 and amasai gaming X 580 and
we haven't tried this yet to do that
you're on risk you would want to use the
same the bios from that specific card
and don't mix and match biases ideally
now also don't try and flash other cards
and builds lloyd pointed this out on his
channel
don't try and flash a 470 with a 580
bios or something like that because
there's a chance that if it doesn't
protect you from doing it the card will
no longer work or it will be hamstrung
so that's always a risky take especially
if you're mixing biases with cards that
they weren't meant for even when scaling
back a generation so that is possible
it's something to look into we'll
probably be looking into it and seeing
if it's worth doing a few other people
have already but you can flash 400 to
500 trees in the same class so 80 and 70
other than that we've got some display
news for the week so aoc has a new 40
inch display and the name of it is get
ready for it it's C 4008 vu8
that's a new display and it is aimed at
professionals and prosumers this times
that means they're targeting something
more like a production screen space and
a more color correct display for
prosumers so the C 4008 vu8 has a 10 bit
VA panel and an 1800 our curvature the
panel pushes a resolution of 4k at 60
Hertz and the screen can reproduce 85%
of the NTSC color gamut and has a 5
millisecond response time connectivity
is 1 VGA ports if you need that one HDMI
1.4 to HTML point o2 DisplayPort 1.2 and
4 USB 3.0 hub with one fast charging
port which is somewhat common for panels
nowadays the panel is $850 on Newegg
which isn't unreasonable for 4k and 40
inch curved we've got two more news
items for you there's a fan tax case of
the Evolve m ATX case it's been around
for a while has a tempered glass update
there is a three millimeter tempered
glass panel as you might suspect and
it's got some changes internally like
bigger support for radiators you go up
to 360 millimeters now in the front
panel and 280 on the top and longer GPUs
are also supported and there's RGB
integration with the case alongside fan
tax velcro cable ties that they've been
doing for quite some time so that will
be coming to market soon and then
finally in the list of upcoming hardware
releases biostar has its many ITX and
for motherboards announced finally we're
starting to see some of those before we
get into this one if you haven't
followed the coverage thus far part of
the reason for the ITX delay is because
it is physically a bit more complicated
to build these boards than previously so
some of the vendors we've spoken to have
suggested that they have to add an
additional layer to the PCB in order to
get the ITX ready chipsets from am 4 on
these motherboards which means extra
complexity in engineering so spending
more time with validation and building
the board that's been part of the delay
but they're starting to come out so
Biostar is among the first they have
their new ITX board that is supposedly
priced at 130 dollars for the racing X
370 G
tn and then there's going to be a
hundred and nine dollar board that uses
a be 350 chipset also Racing be 350 GTN
so these are not the X 300 or a B 300
chipsets the very specific ITX ones they
are the more common be 315 X 370 chipset
but there'll be an IV X form factor so
you get a bit of both X 300 we certainly
still want to look at one look at when
it actually comes out but for now it
looks like there are some options coming
up there in the 110 to 130 dollar price
point we haven't actually reviewed these
or had hands on something to pay
attention to as always thank you for
