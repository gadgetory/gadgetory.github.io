hardware news recap for the week this
week we have well lots of news on
fourth-quarter earnings as it is that
time of year Intel continuing expansion
in one of its Israel fabrication plants
and then there's a new white hat AI
machine learned anti hacking device so
we'll be talking about that as well it's
a supercomputer is what it is except
it's water-cooled so it deserves to be
in the news roundup for an enthusiast
channel before that this video is
brought to you by the coarser 1i 140
compact gaming PC the Corsair 1i 140 is
a small form-factor PC outfitted with a
9700 K RT x 28 e 32 gigabytes of RAM and
a 480 gigabyte nvme SSD all housed
within a 2 millimeter thick aluminum
chassis the Corsair 1i 140 is a 12 liter
system fit for desktop use with the same
sized I 160 counterpart with higher-end
parts
learn more at the link in the
description below very quick GN note
first the disappointment shirt was in
such high demand even after 2018 ended
that we did decide to bring back just
the front of the design and then update
the back of the shirt so it's got a
glitched out GPU artifact with logo as
well so if you wanted the the design
from the disappointment build shirt and
you didn't get it when we first had it
we do have one back on the store just it
doesn't have the 2018 dates on the back
anymore it's not 2018 but it does have a
GPU art effected logo on the back so it
does sort of follow the r-tx artifacting
issues from last year and speaking of
RTS Nvidia's fourth quarter 2018 revenue
lower than expected again so in this
instance starting the week out and video
was met with a 15% drop in its shares as
it updated its quarter for revenue
guidance the full statement from
Nvidia's website highlights quote
deteriorating economic conditions in
China and also points towards headwinds
in the gaming market Nvidia as such
lowered its guidance to a quarterly
revenue of 2.2 billion down about 500
million from 2.7 billion previously
while and video maintains the depletion
of access 10 series cards went mostly
according to plan
despite the as Jensen Wan has said
several times crypto Hanover the company
experienced that lower than expected
sales of high-end GPUs and stated that
some customers quote may have delayed
their purchase while waiting for lower
price points and further demonstrations
of r-tx technology in actual games they
did say actual games there so Nvidia was
was fully aware of some of the
criticisms of arti acts at launch and
we'll see how that pans out as more
games do launch with r-tx in it DX are
in it or in them
additionally nvidia notes that the data
center sector remains cautious and its
purchases and that the company was
unable to close several deals that are
expected to close in quarter four
regarding the the china reference in
their nvidia isn't the only tech company
claiming struggles here nvidia was
joined by apple which recently issued
its own statement a rare adjustment of
first quarter 19 at revenue guidance due
to a slump in iphone sales primarily in
china some news in the fabrication side
of the industry reports indicate that
TSMC is preparing to scrap thousands of
pieces of silicon of chips due to
defective chemicals finding their way
into some of the wafers and causing
damage so in this contamination it seems
that it's linked to a photoresist
chemical details regarding the specific
chemical and the supplier are both
scarce the disruption and fabrication
seems to be isolated to TSM C's 16
nanometer and 12 nanometers lines at fab
14 in southern Taiwan primarily
affecting Nvidia Media Tech high silicon
and Huawei nakai Asian review has a
statement saying quote TSMC has
discovered a shipment of chemical
material used in the manufacturing
process that deviated from the
specification and will impact wafer
yield as we mentioned in our last
Hardware news segment Intel has plans to
expand and upgrade some of its global
fabrication plans and we talked about
their upcoming plans in Oregon for 7
nanometer Intel's plans include Oregon
Israel and Ireland seen significant
investments it seems Israel is next as
Intel is currently weighing an 11
billion dollar investment to build a new
fab Israel's Finance Minister confirmed
that Intel could receive a 1 billion
dollar grant for its investment saying
quote the moment the company comes to
Israel and invest
ten billion it receives a grant of nine
percent that means 91 percent of it
stays here and in the interview on army
radio the Finance Minister continued to
say there are always such discounts
there are always incentives so Intel's
financial outlay here would include a
separate five billion dollar expansion
and it's already sizable operations in
Israel Intel's had fabs there for a
number of years at this point the
expansions would add one thousand new
employee positions to Intel's existing
about thirteen thousand strong workforce
in Israel and if the deals materialized
it would be the largest investment in
Israel and in fabs in general in that
region of the world so this is a pretty
cool and we've long relied on the sort
of white hat hackers to find and
hopefully help fix security
vulnerabilities before they come become
major issues you can look at meltdown
inspector for examples of this or
websites like have I been owned with a P
because it's pronounced owned not pwned
so in relying on those white hat hackers
it seems like such people are going to
be getting assistance from machine
learning soon and one of these examples
is Mayhem a water called white hat
hacking machine so it's pretty cool
mayhem is a water-cooled supercomputer
of sorts it is capable of finding
validating and to some extent patching
potential exploits and vulnerabilities
in software and while this method isn't
new completely or altogether it's
finally getting some some real spread
because machine learning AI dee' putting
all this stuff is now getting a lot more
focus in developments one of the fastest
growing industries in the tech sector
and so we start to see how this applies
to sort of white hat hacking I guess and
mayhem is planning to actually exploit
the vulnerability first to obtain proof
that it exists so this sort of sidestep
some of the concerns with having a false
positive because it will it will exploit
it and validate the existence of the
vulnerability before just simply
reporting that it thinks there's one
there one of Mayhem's first tests came
by setting it loose on every program in
the Debian Linux distribution where
found 14,000 unique vulnerabilities 250
of which were new never before
discovered Mayhem's team for all secured
entered mayhem into DARPA the world's
first all machine hacking competition
put on by the US Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency mayhem was up
against six other machines and would be
judged on its ability to find and patch
vulnerabilities
long story short mayhem won the
competition despite suffering a crash in
the 40th round out of 100 rounds
Mayhem's lead was so sizeable in this
competition that it was able to stay
ahead even with the crash the rest of
the machines that simply couldn't catch
up and that was still with more than
half of the competition left after
winning the competition david brumbley
the co-founder and CEO of for all secure
stated that for all secure would sell
mayhem services to early adopters like
the US government and additionally
Bromley stated that mayhem will work
alongside humans for now but he firmly
believes that in the future machines
will handle the job solo back to some of
the financial news here
AMD posts drawn fourth quarter 2018
earnings and its recent earnings report
and it's renegotiated its wafer
agreement with Global Foundries one of
its largest suppliers of silicon so a.m.
these fourth quarter 2018 earnings are
in and they appeared to have fared
better on average or at least relative
to the Intel and NVIDIA earnings when
considering the some of the adjustments
for both companies both Nvidia and Intel
had quarters that were comparatively
underwhelming fourth quarter 18 revenue
was one point four two billion for AMD
which is a six percent increase
year-over-year with the full year
revenue coming in at six point four
eight billion a 22 percent increase
year-over-year AMD atributes the growth
to a higher revenue and it's a compute
and graphics segment now and these
earning reports are a bit tricky because
it bundles CPU and GPU performance
together so you can't really get a good
feel for how while once performing
versus the other now it's probably fair
to say that the CPU segment
comparatively is doing better than the
GPU segment today at least and that that
was not true some time ago but it is
currently with Rison so Andy's gross
margins are also up it's gone up from 34
percent to 38 percent of course the
company still has some debt to pay down
it is still compared
really small when compared to well Intel
for example which has a market cap
several times higher or nvidia but for
fighting against two companies in two
difficult segments of silicon andy is at
least picking up so shipments of risin
epoch thread Ripper and Radeon are why
it's grown and if you're saying well
they don't make anything else and he
does have another segment then in the
past has performed very well and that's
the semi custom segment so Andy's got
sort of a five pillars approach and one
of those bigger ones is the semi custom
segment where AMD works with companies
like Microsoft and Sony for instance and
in the past with those new consoles that
segments done well but of course it's
slowed down a bit right now
Andy expects first quarter 2019 to be a
little soft compared to the previous
quarter as even it feels the stain of
excess inventory from the cryptocurrency
void quote for the first quarter of 2019
and the expects revenue to be
approximately 1.25 billion dollars plus
or minus 50 million a decrease of
approximately twelve percent
sequentially and 24 percent
year-over-year the sequential decrease
is expected to be primarily driven by
continued softness in the graphics
channel and seasonality across the
business and the further says that the
year-over-year decrease is expected to
be driven by lower graphic sales due to
access channel inventory the absence of
blockchain related GPU revenue and lower
memory sales and the also renegotiated
its way for supply agreement or WS a
with Global Foundries and this is
important because there was a limitation
in there previously so just a quote it
here well Andy freed itself at least
seven nanometer third party supplier
limitation so it can now work with TSMC
basically but the quote was the
amendment provides AMD full flexibility
for wafer purchases from any foundry at
least seven nanometer node and Beyond
without any one-time payments or
royalties Global Foundries will be AMD's
partner for twelve nanometer and above
with the same stipulations as before
applying to using third party suppliers
the amendment will see Andy using Global
Foundries through at least 2021 but TSM
C is now usable for seven nanometer next
up after seven months the interim CEO
and former see
Robert or Bob Swan will assume the role
of Intel CEO permanently Swan assumed
the CEO duties when Brian crows
Annette's resigned in 2018 following and
while an affair with a subordinate which
violated Intel's policies so on we'll
pick up where Cruz and it's left off and
that's the continued transformation of
Intel's business from PC centric to data
centric swallow even notes in his email
saying our core strategy is not changing
we've embarked on what we believe it can
be the most successful transformation in
corporate history we are evolving from a
PC centric to a data centric company and
we must remain focused on playing
offense and innovating for an
increasingly data centric world a world
where all data needs to be processed
moods stored and analyzed Swann has
extensive financial experience and has
previously worked for General Atlantic
eBay and General Electric Intel is
currently conducting an internal and
external search for a new CFO to replace
Bob swans position and finally Intel
supply crisis is well documented at this
point we've been talking about it for it
feels like probably a year specifically
14 nanometer so this supply crisis has
now affected Microsoft to some extent
interestingly and Microsoft has subtly
indicated that its earnings reports are
actually impacted by Intel's of
limitations Satya Nadella CEO and Amy
hood CFO alluded to Intel as the primary
reason for lower-than-expected windows
growth quote now to the results for more
personal computing segments revenue was
13 billion increasing 7 percent results
in our Windows OEM business were lower
than expected partially offset by strong
service results in Windows the overall
PC market was smaller than we expected
primarily due to the timing of chips
apply to our OEM partners which
constrained an otherwise healthy PC
ecosystem and negatively impacted both o
M Pro and non Pro revenue growth now
Microsoft isn't exactly pointing fingers
or naming names but we can read between
the lines pretty well here there are
only two players in the x86 processor
space delivering cpus to OEMs one of
them has had a very public struggle with
in demand and the other one hasn't so
probably Intel and that's it for this
week's news roundup as always you can
