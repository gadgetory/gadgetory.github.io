building a hybrid RX 480
the idea here is to somewhat replicate
the approach that we took to our hybrid
GT X 1080 and that is hopefully to stick
liquid on here now we put one of these
on the GTX 1080 around launch day this
is an ASA tech cooler and it's got an
extruded there's a brand new and
obviously extruded piece of copper here
that helps GP cool and I'll explain that
more in a second before getting to this
content all this is brought to you by
Origin PC and a new origin Chronos
gaming PC which is customizable
upgradable and now shipping with the RX
480
okay so this copper extrusion on the
cold plate this is actually very
important and is part just part of why
the EVGA version of hybrid cards
performs sometimes 10 to 20 degrees
Celsius cooler than competitors that use
a flat cold plate and this is not a
liquid cooler but the idea is the same
when there's a flat cold plate like this
one and not an extrusion liquid coolers
are actually considerably worse with
GPUs and we explain this in some of our
content in the past a lot of it has to
do with curvature of the surface and
things like that but we won't go into
that too much here so I put one of these
on the 1080 it improved the thermals
more than a hundred percent as a percent
difference value down to something like
18 degrees Celsius delta T from we're at
near 60 Celsius with the original cooler
so it was a big deal and it allowed us
to get about next 100 megahertz out of
the clock but we were limited by V bios
at that point and it was still worth
doing so we're doing that here I've
taken this apart part one shows the
teardown if you're curious how this card
pulls apart it goes back together
something like this a very very simple
design exceedingly trivial to take apart
and that's pretty much all there is to
it then there's a shroud somewhere the
shroud just goes back on like that this
is a completely new PCB the existing
products out there do not necessarily
work with it the mounting points these
are the mounting points that we care
about these are very similar to the r9
380
and the 370 cards and as you can see
this goes on the back under the plate so
the mounting points are similar but
they're not the same and that means
things might not work and also the Z
height of this GP if you can get a angle
of that the Z height vertically is only
1.5 millimeters and it used to be one
point nine millimeters so I think we'll
be good and hopefully won't need a shim
but we'll find out very soon the holes
are almost lining up so we might be able
to make that work let's look at some of
the other stuff here is this does it
tiny thing yeah so you remember I was
talking about flat plates versus
extruded ones this is a this is what a
flat one looks like that looks like it
might might barely work with this one on
the bottom left what do we need next I
need to make sure this can mount to the
thing
thermal paste
Adam Savage was just talking about this
in one of their videos untested which is
a channel I really like forget what he
called it I maybe Nolan laying out all
of your parts like this definitely
helpful oh I see that's where the
thermal pads go I guess let's make sure
before I start sticking that on let's
make sure it'll actually work attempted
to remove this plate and put the EVGA
one on there but don't worry about that
later okay so I think all the screws
will line up with the back plate so
that's good too now we just have to see
if the screws will line up with the pomp
and if the pump will make contact to the
surface okay all this effort was just to
see if we could get the the pump to
mount to the the mounting points on this
rx 480 which are different from what
it's technically specified for per the
instructions I think we're okay I think
we just have to install this properly
now now that we know it fits so I'm
going to take this all apart and get it
together correctly let me just see out
of curiosity if we wanted to connect
these could we how many measures let me
measure something this is just digital
calipers 47.62
let's lock that where it is oh that
looks very good any bolts
this is the same same mounting then the
question is do we want to go through the
pain because I think it drains the
liquid out let me make a phone call the
ASA Tech client Rob teller hey I'm
building an Rx for a dihybrid I have a
question for you is it possible
realistically to replace the cold plate
on the the Arctic coin one with the EVGA
one or will fluid come out that's fine
some special oh my god I just kill the
entire team I could we could have them
make you a couple AMG like flat ones and
then extrude one okay cool well for now
we'll do this piece okay so after a
quick call to a Rob teller today's
attack we found out that even though
these it probably you could actually put
that on there realistically it's not
feasible because liquid will leak and we
have no good way to seal that and
prevent any liquid from leaking out so
that's no good we're not going to switch
this this will not mount to the RX 480
because it's just not the right size so
I'm just I'm going to get this out of
the way we're not even going to come
close to using that this time but we're
going to try and do something with it in
the future maybe adapt the adapt the
cold plate or something because this
cold plate is still built for GPUs not
CPUs we should still see good
performance and that's the main concern
is those CPU CLC cold plates have a
different curvature basically just
because the way the CPU hotspots line up
with the cold plate this will work so
let's go ahead and put the thermal pads
on here for vram modules
like this lets get contact I like that
this is well designed I don't think we
want this on there this is a thermal pad
from the original which thermal paste we
want to use here these instructions are
actually pretty damn good they do make
recommendations for how much to use
which is always nice they're
recommending half the compound which
seems like an awful lot but we'll see so
half the compound would be about here
that's about half and it is okay to
bleed over some on the GPU it's not as
sensitive as a CPU when it comes to that
sort of stuff now which way do we need
the tubes oriented I need to know that -
that puts that in the top right which
would have us like this okay that makes
a lot of sense actually that won't
collide with the vram
be nice favorite catch on the other side
other than the CLC assist yeah I was
thinking about that there's a way to do
that yeah put it uh so it's like on the
corner but not going to fall off
hold it there is it aligned with this
screw time apply pressure so push it
back yeah alright I think we're good
right so I had to recruit Andrew to help
get two of these on because and also a
clamp because the thermal paste is
slippery for one and also these Springs
are very high tension and also it's
difficult to align the screw with the
liquid cooler so we're good now though
these are all on and off I can remove
this clamp now that thermal paste by the
way the recommended amount of thermal
paste was was good they recommended to
half that tube turned out to be just
about perfect because of the way it
spread so easily it's a very is not very
viscous there's some some thermal paste
that's more viscous than others
especially if it's diamond compound and
that is not the issue we had here so
because these are spring loaded or
spring tensioned screws they will stop
you pretty naturally once the screws are
about as tight as they should be and
that's it's it's a case of a monkey
Titanic real tight once you start
getting free spins like this check this
out see how we're getting a spin now
that would of course strip the screw if
I kept doing that you can apply more
force and
torque it down get a couple more turns
in there but that's not what you should
be doing there's decent contact it looks
like there needs looks like it may
actually need to be pulled down a little
on this side which I can do by
tightening the screws some more
can you see a it's on this side in there
it looks like it's almost missing in
contact so even if I apply more pressure
here I don't contact a little better
okay I could probably tighten the screws
some more see how that is fully fastened
let's try it
contact looks okay over the center of
the GPU I'm looking at the borders and
I'm seeing it like a hair's width gap at
the border between the copper and the
silicon see if you can try and get that
see if this board's flexing well that is
definitely see it I see if this cracking
kit has a copper shim know about this no
shims though I call Rob again so there's
like contact completely to the silicon
but not completely to the top left edge
of the substrate I mean as it should be
the silicon should be a little bit
fuller than the substrate okay cool I'll
put the vrm heatsink on and we'll be
able to plug it in tonight probably I
was considering streaming earlier but
maybe for the next one but a cooler I'm
going to finish this up thanks for the
info yep see it we're making full
contact with the silicon with the cold
place so the cold plate itself is
touching the silicon completely we're
good there the border of the substrate
which is that got that sort of metal
plate on top of it there's not 100%
contact specifically in this corner but
we think that's okay and I was speaking
to Rob from ASA tech who thinks that's
okay because it's not it's not the part
that gets hot it's not the silicon so I
think we're okay that is the one thing
to note we may look at that for
performance but otherwise everything
looks decent I've backed off the
tightness of the screws a little bit
giving that information because we're
still making 100% contact with the
silicon so there's no reason to over
stress the socket and cause the PCB to
warp so at this point all we've got to
do is figure out the VRM aspect of this
so I've got vrm fans they've given me
this is ooh that could actually fit but
it'd be a bit silly okay so they're
saying to put this like up here and then
just tilt it so that it cools the vram
or another vram the vrm these components
I need a cooled I think we're going to
use this stuff for the vram with that
thermal adhesive see how those look oh
cool that's already got adhesive on it I
just have to peel it so can we stick
this to these old man that is actually
really neat I like that the same goes
for these things as it will go for the
vrm heat sinks that I'll apply in a
moment which is make sure there's no
contact to any electrical components or
it or it could short something there's
one module in there I'm not gonna be
able to access that kind of sucks I'm
not sure the best way to deal with that
that one will get hot so these will go
there this will mount on a pole up here
and be positioned like that so this is
super ghetto a version of a vrm cooler
will pivot this on that pole to cool the
BRM components and then we're going to
put these on top of some of those vrm
components now let's see what do we want
it on here guess all yeah
because the way the fins stick up the
air that gets pushed down will go
through there and dissipate the heat so
these will go on each one of these
that's a freaking lot of this eleven
twelve all right let's try this let's
get these applied is this yes this is
actually a thermal pad that's pretty
cool I like that this is what my what
was this I think this is like six or
seven dollars on Amazon these things
and that's pretty that's pretty damico I
like this this last one I'd love to get
this on there but it's obviously just
not going to happen now that's already
cut it in half okay so next I'll shoot
there's another one too
it'd be kind of janky so the question is
do we want to cover half of this with
one of these yeah this will be fine what
else were we cooling AMD really intense
cooling in this area so that's the next
most important we're going to have to
use this stuff this is thermal adhesive
it's basically glue we're going to use
that to mount these these are VRM
aluminum finned heat sinks we've got a
lot of them with this generic kit for
the the hybrid three Exelero cooler and
on a mount one of these like this on
every one of these hotter components
that's okay so lesson learned that was a
lot of adhesive we don't need that much
for the next one we're going to do a lot
of these
this is a pretty freakin extreme mod to
complaint a city builder gam City
skylines
nice okay all right so those are on now
the next part of the process involves
mounting a fan to a pole which we can
stick through any one of these holes I'm
going to attach these two yeah I think
we have to let it cure we're going to
let these BRM heatsinks cure overnight
it takes about an hour for the thermal
adhesive the cure I'm going to give it
longer than that and we'll be good to go
to test this thing all right so we let
this cure overnight we're back now and
I've made a few changes to the design
while thinking about this letting this
thing dry so first of all these are now
cured they're good to go this is the the
BRM cooling but I did have one thought
and that is I would like to use both
fans that were included with this
actually two thoughts so I'm going to
clamp this to the and this is a little a
little crazy but we're going to clamp
this to the expansion slot bar on our
test bench and then this will be mounted
like that and that'll push some extra
air down to make sure we get the hot air
we really don't want in there out of
there and and get some more cool air
into the VRM and to some of the
components down here down the channel
that do not have a heat sink on top of
them so that's one change that will
happen on the test bench and then the
rest of this my thought here was we're
going to mount this fan like that but I
am NOT going to plug this into the GPU
so we're not going to plug this into the
video card we're actually going to plug
it into the power supply and that'll
give us an extra couple watts off the
card when we're overclocking it so we'll
talk about that more in part three but
let's go ahead and install this then
this pretty simple process we're going
to just send the screw through here this
goes on
over the spot screw spot over here the
hole all right cool so that's it that's
what we got for the video card this will
i'll pivot this based on how I feel
about the thermals as is being tested
we're not plugging into the GPU as I
said so that means the VRM fan speeds
will either not be reported or will be
reported as astronomical numbers and the
reality is it'll just be powered by the
PSU so it should be a hundred percent
power that'll help us with some of the
overclocking attempts and then for
acoustics I might I might plug it back
in to the video card when we're taking
acoustic measurements for the auto pre
overclocked configuration but I'll let
you guys know if we do that so that's it
that's the RX for eighty hybrid check
back for part three this thing will be
in the bench and running soon if it
still works and at that point we'll see
we can overclock it further see if the
thermals are better they certainly
should be and I will look at acoustic
properties and maybe throw an FPS chart
in there with the new overclock settings
