week's hardware news recap so everything
that's happened in the past week and
this is leading into Computex which
means we're about to hit a period of a
season where it is the most Hardware
news as rapidly as possible for this
past week we've got the GT 1030 to talk
about which is Nvidia's response to the
rx 550 and the Vegas stuff Swift tech
and lots of cooling solutions and some
stuff in the memory GDD our six
department we'll get through all of that
in today's hardware news recap before
getting to that this coverage is brought
to you by Corsairs new at t1 race chair
which is a $350 gaming targetted chair
using a bucket style race seat the chair
arms have four directional movement for
configuration to your liking and has a
bonus they use rollerblade wheels learn
more at the link in the description
below start off with some Computex
information before getting to the video
cards and other coverage copy text is a
show that as of last year we're going to
regularly now so we'll be there again
this year we're leaving this week within
days of filming this if not sooner
and we'll be covering all the newest
trends and products at the show so if
you're not subscribed do it now that way
you can catch everything Computex is the
biggest trade show it's bigger than CES
for us in the hardware space and that
means lots of new stuff lots of stuff
that will never make it to market and
prototypes and all kinds of things like
that so stay tuned for that but for the
last week of news is that the GT 1030 is
the first thing we're going to open with
so NVIDIA somewhat quietly released the
1030 and this was in response to and
these rx 550 so you haven't yet reviewed
but we've got one in now finally so 1030
is a response to that it is a budget
card it is less than a hundred dollars
they tend to be in the 70 to 80 dollar
range and because of their low power
output low thermal concerns all that
kind of thing the GT 10 30s are capable
of shipping in half Heights or smaller
form factors and some of them at least
one that we've seen so far are passively
cooled because they aren't hot enough to
really need a fan as long as case
airflow is decent so that makes them
really interesting for mini ITX builds
small form-factor boxes HTPC it seems
like that
ten-thirty is pretty low power though as
you would expect 384 CUDA cores on it
the boost clock natively is at fourteen
sixty eight megahertz without any
modification two gigabyte memory so
pretty limited there as well and it's
mostly a it is entirely a partner launch
so all AI vCard want to look out for
include EVGA no.3 d MSI ACS gigabyte
palette and so attack
they've all got cards out already the
MSI one so far is the only one we've
seen that is passively cooled that's in
stock so that's interesting to look at
well we'll see about that otherwise half
fight is really the main selling point
for gaming if you're actually just
gaming and that's all you care about
it's better to bump out the step to
something like a 560 or a 1050 if you
can afford it rather than getting saving
10 20 bucks and getting in one of these
because the power difference in terms of
gaming ability will be tremendous the
price difference doesn't necessarily
make up for but if you have a specific
use before something like a 1030 it's
out there now we'll try and review on
but it's not high on the list because
it's a low in part move with that a
couple of those already so stay tuned
for more though last week we discussed
the details of Andy's financial and
analyst day or hash tag AMD F ad on
Twitter we covered all of it in a
separate video or well most of it anyway
except for some of the radeon or Rison
pro coverage but the biggest news items
were the AMD vega frontier edition video
card which is a data scientist targeted
device and thread ripper and the epic
cpus if you missed that coverage check
out the video and article on that but
the very basics of it to get it run up
the speed vigor frontier edition was
announced first it's a data scientist
card that means it's not meant for
gaming the gaming stuff for Vega is TBD
probably July or later July or August is
seeming the most realistic based on
industry trends for this type of launch
because they normally push enterprise
business b2b type stuff first so that's
the news with Vega gaming TVD that's the
takeaway here there were some demos that
we talked about those in the original
content thread ripper it
is and these likely i9 competitors the
Intel I nine that we talked about last
week
so that's thread Ripper it will be a an
enthusiast h EDT type of CPU with epic
beam at EP YC being a server grade CPU
and we talked about all that in that
coverage Swift Tech is now offering two
water blocks for the gtx 980ti found
Edition card where a Ivy cards using the
FE PCB both blocks are machined from a
chrome plated copper and acrylic but
differ in cosmetics the Komodo NV - le
features an aluminum backplate with an
included RGB strip while the Komodo NV
eco is a more basic block without the
Avocet accessories additionally Swift
tech offers two new SLI crossfire
bridges to be paired with the new water
blocks like the blocks the bridges come
in both an le and an eco option and
speaking of Swift tech there's a lot of
cooling news this week as seems to be
the trend lately ek has a new gaming
series of liquid cooling solution
options in a box basically calling it a
loop in a box so this is a full open
loop it is sort of baby's first open
loop is the goal here there's trying to
set a lower price point so that it
competes with the expense of CLC is
something like a crack in X 62 would be
in direct price competition to some of
the cheaper AI or fall open loops in the
gaming series from ek they've got 280
models they have a couple others as well
and these kits are making use of empty
five and a quarter inch of Bay's so you
can install some of the components in
those which is a nice use of those and
snow one messes with five and a quarter
anymore and they also include all of the
water blocks that you would need so a
universal water block which includes a
m4 support they've got a plexiglass
reservoir that requires two five and a
quarter Bay's if you've got them which a
lot of people do and two meters of clear
tubing that you can cut to size based on
the loop the ek gaming series includes a
100 milliliter bottle of what they call
cryo fuel or basically mineral oil six
compression fittings and the reservoir
also has an integrated d5 pwm pump which
is one of the more popular ones on the
market and that cryo
you'll concentrate needs to be diluted
with distilled water but they've
supplied everything you need to get
started and the radiator size comes in
to 42 ATM 360 millimeters including two
or three fans depending on rad size
Noctua meanwhile has announced new 200
millimeter 120 millimeter and 40
millimeter fans this week in addition to
a new fan controller anti-vibration
mounts and SATA power adapter the new
120 millimeter model fan is 10
millimeters thinner than a standard 120
mil fan and is designed for water
cooling where space is limited the 40
millimeter fan has conversely seen its
thickness increased for deployment in
the high-pressure applications like
routers and DVRs and the new SATA power
adapter permits a four pin to SATA
connection so fans can be run straight
from a PSU the new controller meanwhile
accommodates three four pin fins and is
manually controllable you can check
naktu as website for pricing and
availability and more information on
that building upon the existing design
of the original h7 cryo rigs redesign
includes an extra heat pipe as well as
rearranging heat pipes to better absorb
heat around the CPU hotspots the new h7
is 145 millimeters tall 98 mil deep and
it should mitigate clearance issues for
both the cases and RAM since a lot of
the cases have a 150 millimeter height
clearance and so the RAM can start
bumping into things with the Z series or
am4 boards the newer h7 runs a bolstered
160 watt TDP support up from the
preceding models 140 watt TDP notably
the h7 quad Lumi has RGB lighting with
control via n z-axis cam software that's
kind of noteworthy and interesting and
the cooler is compatible with both Intel
and AMD sockets including a m4 and will
sell for about $60 in June one more
quick one in the cooling Department
reven will reportedly be at Computex
this year they've announced at least one
product a bit early and that's the new
Kiran line the RGB fans will offer 11
translucent blades in conjunction with
RGB lighting and fit and standard 120
millimeter fan slots these uses sleeve
bearings and the fans should be priced
at around 17 dollars mostly targeting
the RGB craze because otherwise they're
just fans and in case news Lian Li has a
new case that's kind of targeted at the
bench market so this is where the core
p3 really shines in being a traditional
case it also works in a test bench
deployment the Lian Li PCT 70 ever with
their friendly names and very usable
letter and number amalgams the PCT 70
and PC o 12 WX are the new cases to talk
about one of these is the test bench
that's the t 70 and the t71 shown at CES
but it's actually coming to market now
should be available as of this video for
the most part out of box it's an
open-air bench you can buy an additional
accessory which they have labeled the
t71 and the t71 is what allows it to
turn into a closed air bench basically
more of a standard case but still
somewhat accessible the PCO 12 WX
meanwhile is a mid tower case a standard
enclosure and it uses Lian Li is a
custom aluminum and glass construction
which they have basically everything
because of that it's a bit more
expensive aluminum and glass not really
the cheapest component and it's
primarily comprised of three
compartments say that three times fast
and they've cut effectively different
component sections within the case so
you can compartmentalize things which
really helps more with how you're laying
it out in terms of looks than anything
it's not as much of a cooling or a noise
concern as it is desperate looks so
those are the two new lis Emily case the
two seventies $190 goes back to what we
said about test benches being really
expensive and the PCO 12 WX is $400 so
it's really that's just what they do
couple more quick ones in the peripheral
Department two Rockets got their new
leader Mouse available for pre-order
with allies sensors shipping in the mice
the CES 2017 event from rocket is where
we first saw that ally sensor as they
call it
that's a collaboration with Pixar it's
one of the most prolific sensor makers
right now that resulted in a modified
Pixar 3360 sensor which is now called D
picsArt 33 61 the sensor is shipping in
three of Rockets mice the leader the
cone EP and the cone pure 2017
and moreover the wireless leader is now
available for pre-order at via Rockets
website and that's 140 bucks so that
lines up all of the new Maoist
announcements that we've seen lately
including Corsair razor and now rocket
also in peripherals there's new Acer
predator Z 35 P display that was
announced and shown it's an 8-bit 35
inch and VA panel over clocked at 120
Hertz from the factory which is 100
Hertz in native the panel features an
1800 hour curvature and uses a 2500 to 1
contrast ratio to round it out the Z 35
P has a 4 millisecond great great
response time 300 its brightness 100 by
100 base amount and gsync support and
that display will cost $1100 and the
final two news items are in the storage
and memory world the first one that is
probably the most interesting is SK
Hynix at GDD are 6 specifications that
were posted in the past week and those
specs include information on the GDD r6
product stack that they have
theoretically panning out for 4th
quarter of 2017
for the manufacturers to start deploying
in their products that may be something
like Volta it could be other things as
well but we'll find out closer to fourth
quarter 2017 the new memory will have an
8 gigabyte capacity and it offers data
rates of 14 Giga transfers per second
with a 1.35 operating voltage not too
different from what we've seen now but
some changes overall as we roll through
the rest of summer we should learn more
about this memory and the new spec as G
DDR 6 is still brand new and then
finally Western Digital is expanding the
capacity of its and that's oriented to
hard drives with helium allowing them to
fit more platters inside the hard drive
chassis WD red and red pro series now
offer a 10 terabyte option both with 256
megabytes DRAM cache the
consumer-oriented WD red uses a 5400 rpm
motor a 3-year warranty is offered with
that and it cost four hundred ninety
four dollars now meanwhile the WD red
pro is 7200 RPM for the motor and has a
five-year warranty so that's your
primary difference with what WD calls a
quote advanced vibration protection
technology which is just kind of what
all these drive vendors used
Frenchie's they're high and low and
mine's WT red pro 533 bucks a bit more
and that rounds out the news so as
always you can go to patreon.com/scishow
and one extra tops out directly and go
to store gamers nexus dotnet to buy
shirts exactly like this one
we've got Cotton's in stock and
subscribe for Computex because that'll
be big for us thanks for watching I'll
see you all next time
