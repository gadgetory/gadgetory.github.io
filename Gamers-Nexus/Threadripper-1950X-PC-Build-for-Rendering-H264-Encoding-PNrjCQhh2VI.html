feel the pain this is the trendline
price of a kit of memory and this graph
alone is the killer of our PC build
lists these bills guides used to be a
staple for the website and we
occasionally bring them over to video
format but memory prices and GPU prices
had months of simultaneous insane
inflation so to speak they were
ballooning like crazy from supply
shortages on both sides
this made PC building difficult to
afford with GPU prices stabilizing and
memory on sale still higher than what it
used to be but we thought we'd put
together a high-end thread river system
and see how it does this is the first PC
build we've published in months aside
from the gift build we did for the zdg
the patreon backer but we're trying to
publish a few during the holiday season
links where everything will be in the
description below as always this
coverage is brought to you by ifixit.com
and their protec toolkit i fix it as
refreshing their protec toolkit in time
for the holidays you can find a link in
the description below to the protec
toolkit and other toolkits that iFixit
sells we find the protec and essentials
kits to be the most useful for DIY
enthusiasts so a couple things here this
is a pc build pc builds are a minefield
of everyone being smarter than you
that's just how it is all the cuy seen
the comments I've seen what you people
say to Paul and Kyle and all of them and
it's not new to us either you we've been
posting PC builds on the site for I
don't know five years at this point and
the thing is for this build it's a
couple items of note one we're only
using parts we have to its build that
I'm going to use for some production
rendering and that we can apply towards
things like for example blender
rendering and animations things like
that video compression h.264 compression
of our video library that we store for
b-roll these are real use cases that we
have so I don't care what you would put
in the system instead that's not really
the point the point is this is what we
built and I'm going to show you how it
performs and if you can do it better
great do it I guess so yeah PC builds
this one is a system that we actually
have used for it's got a thread over
1958
go through all the parts and some
benchmarks in a minute and originally I
was going to include the 1920 X but the
price is right when we were looking at
starting this build the prices fell to
where the 1950 X more-or-less became
1920 x in price drop $200 to 800 bucks
and I we we own these parts already
about for purposes of creating a list
within a certain budget originally the
goal was 1920 X we went with 1950
because the $800 is now the motherboard
is a gigabyte X 399 des ignore e board
or designer if you prefer the
bastardized version and it's got a kid
of g.skill 30 200 megahertz memory at 32
gigabytes because you need the memory
for this type of workload we threw in
the Asus 1080i Strix it did just win one
of our awards in the GPU award show we
did for Best Overall cooler design on a
1080i and then there's plenty of options
for other things as well but this is
what we went with so to address a few
obvious points straight away yes you can
do a cheaper power supply we have a/c
Sonic Prime in here I like the power
supply and it's reliable it's not going
to have any problems as all kinds of
protections in it so we used it it's
going to do production so it needs to be
reliable but yeah you can definitely cut
cost in a few places
we're aware but let's go through the
benchmarks and then you know if you want
to shave off couple hundred bucks by
choosing cheaper parts you could
absolutely do that and in the article
that's linked in the description below I
will include suggested alternatives if
you would prefer to use something
cheaper than what we did because there
are cheaper options but we might not
have had them here or for my purposes I
didn't want to use them in a system that
I was building for whatever different
reason than you might be so the first
part is the 1950 X we originally were
going to do this with the thread Ripper
of 1920 X as noted but this was a good
deal so it didn't really increase our
budget target but it got us a better CPU
for our intended render tasks for
blender workloads on the CPU all that
really matters is threads frequency
definitely helps but high thread count
is our first priority
the 1950 X solves this it's also power
of fish
so that's a bonus and it's pretty easy
to cool in general $800 the 1950 ex is
an especially good deal for a high on
production PC right now this isn't
something that's built for games really
you'd be better off with insult for that
still even the i9 platform if you're
really serious about regular gaming that
high frame rates for example but that's
not why you buy thirty-two thread
processor so to catch everyone up on
thread Ripper in its use cases with this
amount of threads one of the issues
around launch with communication with
AMD was we basically asked them hey we
can CUDA accelerate all of this stuff
and it's faster so what's the use case
here why should we care and they didn't
really have an answer for us but we
found a couple on our own one of those
is with rendering blender files there's
another type of rendering that we
started doing where if we design for
example a high quality 3d model to
eventually turn it into an orthographic
image to put on a shirt like that's
convenient like this one exactly like
this one so we designed stuff like this
in blender and then it's 3d model but
you do an orthographic view and you
basically get what appears to be a
two-dimensional image so for something
like that we've found that the CPUs
actually make a lot of sense in blender
and that's because the tiles render so
quickly that you basically just want as
many tiles in a flight at once as
possible and so the 32 thread CPU helps
there so that's a real use case where
the CPU can start to edge out the cuda
accelerated stuff another use case is
h.264 so we talked about this previously
where our video compression scripts to
shrink down all the b-roll and stuff
like that is done with h.264 encoding we
use handbrake which is like a wrapper
for ffmpeg and you could do that with
CUDA as well but I mean our script works
great it's fairly lossless as far as the
human eye can tell and it runs on the
CPU you could do to accelerate it again
but I mean if it's reliable and it works
and it's like a business critical
operation you really don't want it screw
with it so that's another good use case
for thread Ripper though is stated in
terms of benchmarks we previously tested
the 1950 X
blender and found the performance
results that we can put on the screen
now these are not surprisingly just
outside of the 79 to 80 X Y performance
range at $2,100
but the 19 to the X is among the
chart-topping CPUs it's fairly
affordable and while comparatively to
the other h EDT stuff anyway and it's
doing well here we're also using in
terms of video cards the 1080 TI Strix
for this build specifically but the plan
is to put a couple more cards in here
and then you could use it as a render
box for GPU rendering if you want to do
that instead this 1080i Strix one our
best overall award in the 1080i category
to briefly recap the Strix version of
the 1080 T is has the best noise to
thermal performance that we've found on
an air-cooled card this year and it
manages to maintain proportionally lo
MOSFET theorem and G V temperatures even
with the noise normalize output a 40 DBA
the Strix card was only ever beaten by
liquid cooled cards and the Strix
requires less overall real estate
internally while still maintaining
competitive temperatures this means
higher clocks Pascal does drop clocks
once you go above 60 C and it also means
that we can keep the operating noise
levels a bit more reasonable on the
build we're using the gigabyte X 399
does ignore a board for this build this
is the first time we've used the
gigabyte board for thread Ripper up
until now it's all been done on the $500
Asus Zenith extreme gigabytes board
comes in $100 cheaper but sticks with an
eight phase-- vrm that uses 50 amp IR
35:56 power stages with a familiar ir35
201 voltage controller gigabyte is using
a three plus two phase memory via Rama
with 40 amp power status for the ddr4
voltage which is more than enough for
what we're doing the heatsink is
somewhat thin so that's way better than
most the artsy heat sinks that are out
right now sadly so we can give some
credit for that it's not my deal Finn
density but it's better than a fat block
of aluminum so whatever give-and-take I
guess the airflow afforded by the top
mounted CLC amply cools the vrm anyway
and ignoring the more obvious BRM
features we also like the insane amount
of fan headers that go
I put on this board because you put them
to use there are seven total fan headers
all four 10 PWM and all seven are on the
border of the motherboard which makes
them a bit easier to hide and route the
cables behind things rather than over
things the other boards on the market a
lot of them do have headers crowns
between EPS 12-volt headers or behind
the video card which is a pretty small
and insignificant but otherwise
noteworthy feature where gigabyte makes
those more accessible the gigabyte BIOS
needs a serious improvement though it's
mostly navigable but we'd like to see
your goodbyes add more options at a top
level rather than bury everything in sub
levels and we'd like to see them move
away from the slide in menus on the
bottom and the sides which really just
get in the way more than anything
memories next this is a bit rough right
now we want to use quad channel for this
machine so we need at least four sticks
and we're gonna be going with 32
gigabytes
unfortunately there's no good way to get
around spending $400 or more on a 32
gigabyte kit of memory from retailer
we're using stuff we already have as
noted but for a new build you're really
getting kind of screwed on the memory
rather than thinking of the $200
discount on the 1950 X as savings think
of it more as your extra budget for
memory that'll help neutralize the
feeling of being raked through the coals
for overpriced DRAM 3200 megahertz is
enough for what we're doing and going
beyond that will largely net diminishing
returns given the tremendous price
increase so here's the power supply this
is admittedly where we went a bit higher
end than necessary on the system we
recently started developing a serious
appreciation for the high end power
supplies like the EVGA T 2 that we've
been using and in our own production
machines high NPS use have four years
now saved us from short circuits over
current power surges bond runtimes are
afforded by the high NPS use even under
abusive loads so for anyone who needs
reliability it is actually worth the
investment to go with something
higher-end sure you can drop down and
get a 80 to 100 dollar power supply and
be fine yes we know you're way better as
a system builder and everyone applauds
your comment but this is what we wanted
to use specifically for a high end build
production machine sees onyx prime
series has good options between 80 plus
gold and titanium at depend on how crazy
overkill you want to go
it's got options in the 850 to 1000 watt
range we'll be talking about power
numbers in a second though 850 watts
would be enough for this particular
build and would let you operate within
on 115 volts from the wall you'd be well
within your 50 to 60 percent peak
efficiency range if you wanted that and
if you're doing multi-gpu for rendering
configurations you'd want a higher power
supply wattage obviously well let you
make that call though this will
particularly hinge on whether or not
you're using the 19 to the X and 1080i
is simultaneously to render or do
whatever or whether one is doing all of
the work on its own for power
consumption and using the titanium Class
C sonic unit just because that's when we
have it's going to be a bit more
efficient obviously but perhaps
needlessly so when compared to the
acceptable efficiency of gold
we found these numbers for Power on the
screen because they are titanium rated
they're pretty close to 1 to 1 draw in
terms of efficiency with this build and
a high performance mode and with stock
clocks we're drawing 115 Watts idle
that's again high performance mode you
can drop it down to 72 watts
multi-threaded Cinebench 128 wise single
threaded to 74 watts with a single CPU
instance of blender and spinning off to
blender instances one on the GPU and one
on the CPU rendering from both ends of
the animation that gets us to 425 watts
so say you've got 300 frames you're
under 1 to 150 and 151 to 300 and that's
what we get there we've done things like
this in the past when we needed to get
things rendered as quickly as possible
but couldn't fit more cards in the
system and we would set the CBT render
some of the frames and let the GP has
handled the rest at 425 watts for peak
load we have more room to work with for
the overclock so later overclock in the
CPU it's a 4 gigahertz all core at one
point 3 5 volts and then the GPU to a
plus 75 mega Hertz offset plus 500
megahertz core with power target maxed
we ended up at 580 watts for the dual CP
plus GB render and that increased us by
40 watts for the gaming test with total
war Warhammer
and increased us by 130 watts for
Cinebench keep in mind that a 4
gigahertz overclock on the 19th of the X
will sometimes deliver worse performance
well and that would be in cases like
gaming because games can leverage XFR
that goes beyond 4 gigahertz so the 4
gigahertz all core we
actually have worse single and quad
thread performance but better all thread
performance just depends on what you're
doing
we chose the thermal take view so d1 for
the enclosure we've worked with a few
full towers this year like the be quiet
dark Bass Pro 900 white edition what we
liked the view 70 wanted for this build
the case is surprisingly well ventilated
- thanks to the large gaps around all
the panels and accommodates our ni max
like three sixty millimeter radiator
pretty well you wouldn't think that it's
good in terms of cooling but if you look
closely you can see that there's giant
1-inch gaps between every single panel
including the side panels so that solves
that problem
we also relocated some things in this
case so although it's mostly sufficient
for airflow with the stock setup we had
up moving the fan from the rear over to
the front relocating it so we could have
2 140 millimeter rain fans in the front
it would be a bit more symmetrical that
way and then we install the blackout on
zxp fan in the back that cost you a
couple bucks this was for three primary
reasons one it looks better so that's
easy - we want it to feed more air
straight into the GPUs as if you're
planning to add multiple cards for
rendering for example to accomplish them
more quickly then the extra fans of the
front will definitely help with that
three we've got three exhaust fans set
up with the wick tech unit so we needed
to make sure that there was no
suffocation in terms of the unit's
ability to pull air in from the front
and also make sure it doesn't steal the
air from the GPUs so the case makes it a
damn heavy build thanks to all the
tempered glass but this thing shouldn't
really be moving once it's in place
anyway it's gonna be doing work for the
cooler we're using that 360 millimetre
lick tech unit we could have gone with
the Noctua Nhu 14s but we wanted two
things one the ability to scale up the
GPU configuration to fit as many cards
as possible for rendering which means
needing slot clearance and two lower
noise normalized performance the lake
tech cooler is expensive though so
anyone who can get by on air or its
going for a single card config would do
pretty well actually better off with the
Nhu 14s from nock - it's much cheaper it
performs not that much worse and it's a
perfectly good cooler just a matter of
does it work for your use case as our
thermal test results show they're both
good coolers they can adequately cool
the CPU even when overclocked lynktec
though is high-quality we took it apart
and it's
got a well-built block that's easily
refilled so we've liked it thus far
we've been pretty impressed with the
lake taxi our fours overall quality and
honestly speaking frankly here we really
don't really attribute quality to enter
max units but the tr4 ones are pretty
good they've this is the best that
they've done in a long time and they're
outperforming their competition who want
with smaller cold plates plus the go
blade actually has micro fins all the
way across so animatics job well done on
this one here's a thorough Oliver's time
chart for the leaf tech cooler under an
intense load in this abuse everyone case
for this workload we were torturing the
system with a simultaneous prime95 ABX
load and a moderate GPU workload mean
we're throwing off pretty close to the
maximum heat potential in this case even
still we're at around fifty six point
eight degrees Celsius forty die and the
GPU again was running a workload as well
so it's not just the CPU here and the
CPU is perfectly fine in terms of
thermals it has no problems whatsoever
we're actually going to be using network
storage for this so talking about
storage your options would probably be
something like a raid configuration you
might do with something like a 3-way WD
red raid setup for something smaller and
cheaper data redundancy and speed
requirements vary entirely based on the
user so that's up to you but we've used
WD Reds for raid 5 in production systems
in the past and are currently actually
and that works for a limited drive bays
or a limited cost setups raid 10 might
be good for a machine like this though
we're just gonna be running off of an
SSD for the OS and then run a 10 gigabit
cable to our local server so that solves
all of our storage concerns instantly so
that's the build there's some of the
benchmarks we have a project of
converting the office basically to a 10
gigabit set up it might make a video on
it the plan there is going to include
compressing a bunch of videos on the
NASS remotely from another system so
something like this it'll actually
utilize the threads on this machine and
then access the files over Ethernet
compress them we delete the old ones and
it really improves our process the
machine will be torn down after it
because I need all of these parts for
actual benchmarking that's the reason we
keep them around it's not to make a
bunch of computers it's so that we can
benchmark them as things iterate and
drivers come out and new tasks emerge
and things like that so it will get torn
down but that's kind of that intended to
use case for this there are lots of
things to improve if if you really were
going to go buy and build something
yourself from scratch I would for
example the fan setup I like with the
two intake and one exhaust so you'd want
to buy a fan for the exhaust if you do
the liquid cooler setup then probably I
just run it out of lower rpm you could
save money by going with a 240
millimeter if you want to keep the
liquid cooling but the 360 looks pretty
good in this case so and they're not
that distant in price and it is
technically better if you want with air
you might run into issues with blocking
off the top PCIe slot but if you're only
doing a couple GPUs that can be lowered
down then that's not a big deal one
concern is with MDOT 2 devices if you're
running multi-gpu here and there under
heavy load from blender rendering on all
of them the problem is with MDOT 2
devices you're gonna have them buried
under those cards so they will
incinerate and the flash doesn't care
the flash actually likes to run at a
higher temperature when it's active it
should be stored at a cold temperature
but run at a higher temperature the
controller cares controller might
throttle you if it really starts burning
from the video cards so that's a concern
that might be a legitimate reason to I
don't know go with you dot well can't
really do that you just go with
different interface basically or try and
figure out how to get a fan on those it
would be my concern but yeah power spot
can be a bit cheaper the the
motherboards fine he could do a little
cheaper but this I wouldn't want to
you're buying a thousand dollar CPU
what's another 400 on a board at this
point and yeah I think that's most of it
really just storage is up to you so
that's it for this one if you want to
see more subscribe because we're gonna
be doing a bit more work around holiday
seasons when I try to do a bunch of
logistics and
office-like upgrade or web server
upgrade things like that as always
