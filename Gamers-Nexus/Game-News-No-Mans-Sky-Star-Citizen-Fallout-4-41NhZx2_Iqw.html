dotnet and we are talking about some
game news so it is the crunchiest time
of year right now the industry is
ramping into the November launch cycle
littered with the hopes and dreams of
small startups like EA Games and
Bethesda and they're all clawing their
way to the top of a digital cesspool of
pre Christmas sales that time of course
brings with it some major video game
news and that's exactly what we're
covering here today this week's major
game news includes a pair of
high-profile spaceflight exploration
titles I bet you can guess what one of
them is the impending onslaught of
utterly unimpressive scoreboard
screenshots that we will soon have to
endure from overwatch and the return of
classic RPGs alongside some fallout 4
mod news so let's get started with no
man's sky no man's sky just posted its
I've seen things trailer that is the
name of it which shows ships warping
into battle planetary exploration of
procedurally generated and handcrafted
terrain and more no man's sky bills
itself as a space sim with a mix of
space combat and first-person
exploration so it's got a bit of
everything but it is certainly more
heavily focused on the exploration
aspect and planetside elements of the
game as it stands currently the game it
does hope to achieve at some level of
spaceflight accuracy but not nearly the
same level as some other active titles
like the lead dangerous or certainly
star citizen as it hopes to do and its
biggest differentiating factor comes
from the planetside adventures and
fantastical environments as seen here
you can land plant outside with your
ship get out walk around and all that
sort of stuff the trailer is certainly
newsworthy in its own right but more
newsworthy is the game's June 2016
release time frame and this is the first
official word we've heard on a release
date yet that was announced at Sony's
recent PlayStation conference star
citizen for other topical news points we
we'll be adding a new flight model in
the alpha 2 point 0 build so developer
cloud imperium games posted a blog post
on its website that showed some of these
star citizen alpha 2 point 0 plans which
was initially announced with the
Hollywood cast so if you watched citizen
Khan and our coverage of that you will
be familiar with some of alpha 2 point 0
already but the big news for today is
the new flight model which is pretty
important for fans who may have grown
tired of the current placeholder system
it is well known that the current system
is a placeholder but it's just not been
a priority to push out an updated system
I guess until this point under a
significant amount of demand from the
backers there will be a few primary
modes of flight and star citizen
simplified down to four i FCS profiles
which are classified as precision for
takeoff and landing to help you avoid
smashing into station or planetary
objects from lack of fine control
especially with digital input devices
with like keyboards where you can't
control the input more finely as you can
with an analog joystick there's also a
space combat maneuvering mode or SCM
which uses formulas to calculate the
strongest turning axis calculate the
maximum velocity and the drift controls
there's an afterburner mode which is an
extension to SCM and that assists in
delivering cleaner more fluid gameplay
mechanics by way of adding what is
effectively a nitrous oxide injection as
you get with racing games and those
familiar with racing games will
immediately see the usefulness here
which is that you can use the
afterburner to assist in drifting and
acceleration that exists to some extent
already but it's being amped up and
improved upon in the new update and you
can read the dev blog post for more
information on that cruise mode is the
final ifcs profile that's at the top
level here and that allows for traveling
at great distances with significantly
faster speeds than what SCM allows SCM
is built and tuned for spaceflight
combat so that mode is
is under the assumption that you are in
some sort of dog fight or greater combat
endeavor which requires precision
controls but not the same level of
precision required for takeoff and
landing so it's a mix of speed and
maneuverability the full official blog
post goes into the math behind all of
the different modes of transit for those
you want deeper details on formulas
involved in speed calculations and all
that sort of stuff you can check the
link in the description below for the
article which contains more of that
information if it is of interest
overwatch i first played overwatch at
some packs event i think it was PAX
Prime 2014 or something like that and
the game felt fine i wrote a an article
about it pretty short preview piece and
it felt kind of like team fortress or
now now that it's out and we know it
even exists dirty bomb would be another
good comparison but overwatch has new
characters some obvious MOBA influence
and the typical blizzard flare with its
character design and development
overwatch never really struck me as
revolutionary but it was certainly fun
enough and could make a name for itself
if blizzard adequately supports the
title going forward and as a standalone
title it's supposed to be a pretty fluid
quick fast paced shooter sort of twitchy
but not too much so it's not full unreal
but it's not full team fortress 2 either
and then it's got some interesting
mechanical elements with its many many
characters which there can only be one
of each per team so that certainly adds
the mechanics as well and this week we
learned that overwatch has officially
entered its first major closed beta
phase with registrations it's still
being sent through battle.net so if you
haven't gotten an invite yet there's
still hope you might still get one the
blizzard team is selecting beta testers
through battle.net account so be sure to
a check your account or associate an
email to see if you've been accepted and
we'll be testing the game in short order
and we'll certainly be posting gameplay
videos showcasing the
games actual mechanics and play through
potential as a complete 180 we now look
to good old games for its revival of a
series of old-school rpgs those of you
who are fond of 90s see rpgs inspired by
dragonlance and Dungeons and Dragons
will be happy to hear that dark sun
which is a dnd official title ravenloft
and Krenn which is one of the locales
and dragon lands are all slated for
arrival on Good Old Games the titles
have been digitally updated for
compatibility with modern hardware and
operating systems and you'll get the
same crisp pixel perfect graphics of
their 90's release dates and by pixel
perfect I mean you can probably count
the pixels in the games fallout 4 is the
last news item for this episode fallout
4 is fast approaching as you all likely
know it's slated for a November 10th
launch and will soon have our review
samples in hand but until that point
there's a final bit of news before the
launch Bethesda's Pete Hines one of the
official employees whose pretty active
on Twitter replied to a tweet asking
about mod availability and if or when
mods will be made available through the
fallout 4 channels so Pete Hines stated
that quoting him if it's okay with you
we're going to focus on the game release
first and talk about mods when we
figured some stuff out so it seems that
as of now there may not have be
officially supported mod development
tools immediately at launch but it's
almost guaranteed that Bethesda will
eventually release a toolkit it would
just it would be totally
uncharacteristic of them not to so I'm
not really worried about that not
happening but we'll see if the paid mods
Fiasco has had any impact on the
company's decisions for Fallout 4 and
it's modding options that's all for this
week's news that let me know what you
think of this type of shorter easier
video in terms of easier to digest and
easier to make let me know what you
think in the comments below we're still
doing the heavy hitting hitting stuff
still doing just as much of it but I
wanted to fill the gaps with content
that can keep
everyone in the loop on the games and
the hardware industries and keep the
information flowing there's a lot of
stuff that doesn't get its own video or
article just because of the sheer volume
of information so that's what these
shorter series are for check out the
patreon link in the post roll video to
help us out and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
