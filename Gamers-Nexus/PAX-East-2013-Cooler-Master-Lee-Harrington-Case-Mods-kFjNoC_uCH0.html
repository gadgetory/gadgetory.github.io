East and I'm sure walking through a
couple of our cases this is our new half
X be mounted by Lee Harrington from PC
junkie mods he put an intel SSD up front
a 240 radiator right in the front here
you can see through the top panel that
he he cut this out and cut out the side
panel as well most liked this side
panels full so when he spends around you
get a good view of it as a z77 extreme
board from intel 3770k swiftech custom
parts there's a 240 reservoir on front
and 240 radiator in front with the
reservoir boot and there's another one
in the bottom that you'll be able to see
on the other side these are two EVGA 680
hydro coppers it has a silent pro hybrid
1300 watt power supply that's fully
modular we just leave the cave cables in
black and blue you can see you painted
the entire interior blue as well if you
scan over here to this side you can see
the fully modular power supply and the
other radiators in there one of the
benefits of this case is that that you
can see the screws right here on the
side that motherboard tray can come out
you can rot your cables do whatever you
want put it back in any kind of makes
you need to do this similar case of this
was on CQ magazine this month it's a
green machine by brian white it looks
really good same same kind of concept is
that
this is a scout to gunmetal again modded
by Lee Harrington he fully disassembled
it painted the interior red and still
had this chromed he hand made all these
with copper tubing he bent it himself
sent it off to somebody to get chromed
out you see both of these systems have
Mayhem's in it this one has read this
one has white and I mean 32 gigs ram
another 3770 this is on a EVGA z77 FTW
there's a 240 on top and the 240 on the
front and this this entire front mesh
here this hexagon was made by Lee that's
not the stock one he spent a lot of time
on this mod if we spin it around real
quick you can see the other side's
painted it's all really really nice and
high quality he is an amazing water and
also they all have the nice custom feet
on them like just the attention to
detail on these cases is just
spectacular and that's something that
we've come accustomed to from lee and i
think that's it for these two systems
thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
