hitting two gigahertz on Vega 64 or 56
it's not happening they're not hitting
19 28 megahertz they're not hitting
nineteen forty eight megahertz they're
fine not hitting 18 hundred megahertz
but keep people keep reporting this and
the reason is because there's a bug in
the reporting for the software but if
you stop and think about it for a second
the cards are not hitting two gigahertz
that's 400 megahertz higher or 500 than
what they ship at don't you think AMD
would have added a little bit more to
the clock if that were so easily
possible before that this coverage is
brought to you by cable Maude already
well-known for their work in custom
sleeved power supply cables cable Maude
is now venturing into liquid cooler
tubes leaving with their new AIO
sleeping kits compatible with Corsair
and NZXT as of now check the link in the
description below for more information
we're going to demonstrate that even
with a two hundred percent power offset
and with three hundred and eighty watts
going to a Vega 56 which is by default
cap to 300 even under those
circumstances we're not going to hit
these high insane numbers on clock and
hopefully show once and for all what the
clock bug is in the current drivers okay
so we're going to do a demo of this
clock bug in action and if there's
background noise I'm sorry they're a
bunch of really high rpm fans hooked up
to this video card which is under a
three sixty millimeter radiator so
here's our work load it's frozen but
it's still engaging we're currently
reading 1312 megahertz stock which who
knows if that's accurate and then we can
go down to here this happens whether or
not you have the special offset we do
even if it's 50% same bug so at 242
percent offset we're pushing 300
something watch through the card right
now and then let's just go ahead and go
straight to the frequency stuff so we're
reading 50 90 mega Hertz right that's
because we've offset the power by 242
percent so it's no longer power choking
which was limited us to 13 whatever it
was
so that looks cool but then what if we
do something like set a we can use any
one of these tools they all produce the
same bug let's first set voltage I'm
going to use Y
tool for that so let's might as well
just type in 1200 everywhere 1200
then watt - I'm going to go ahead and
type in 1200 and on what tool we also
have 1622 for DPM six and seven and
before anyone says hey but you also need
to change BPM as one through five no
that's not how it works with custom mode
on only six and seven are active so now
so you sent that to 1622 with 1.2 volts
it looks like it's applied we're not we
haven't crashed and this still works so
okay that's cool our overclock is really
good I guess what if we uh what if we
overclock this thing's something crazy
like 1780 megahertz maybe it'll just
crash instantly nope still working and
this says 1782 megahertz on GPU core
this is 1780 two megahertz this is 1780
megahertz everything things for 1780 two
megahertz so you can see why people
would be tricked by this not really
their fault although you should think
about it a bit because it really kind of
becomes obvious once you start hitting
numbers like you know what 1809 high
enough to prove a point we do 1880
so another 100 megahertz or what we just
did this is this must be a card that was
Bend really well because right 1882
megger 1882 everywhere it says 1882 yo
what's the max what if we type in 2000
megahertz to gigahertz it looks high pH
1080p I think we go higher 1980 there
you go 1980 okay you know what we're
going for two gigahertz yep Wow look at
that two gigahertz and it doesn't even
flinch it almost looks like the
framerate hasn't even improved that's
weird
well there's a reason for that because
it's bug so this is all wrong everything
is incorrect if you encounter this bug
what you need to do is reset everything
and then redo it until you get to a
point where the performance stops
improving so rather than doing what I'm
doing here in the background which is
pretty normal for overclocking you kind
of find your ballpark by running the
application on loop and waiting for it
to crash rather than waiting for a
driver crash because they won't what you
need to do is actually kill this and
then keep running fire strike or
whatever software you use keep running
it over and over and just enable the
graphics core test and see if it
improves
not let me show you what I can't with
earlier because I did this in advance
save us some time so earlier we came up
with the numbers down here when we were
at a 9% core offset a 980 megahertz
HBM we got a graphic score of 22,000 659
to give you perspective our absolute
stock score zero changes whatsoever out
of box 56 no special cooler no special
power hack 18,000 892 points add 50%
power to that no other changes 20,000
769 points but the 10% improvement stock
HBM at 950 21,000 660 HBM 950 with a 9%
overclock 22,000 to 28 you can see the
scaling here we're at 2.6 percent over
the previous number and we settled that
22 6 5 9 with a 980 overclock on the HP
i'll and i'm personick or well we did
our mod here and started thinking right
are we burst this thing first then you
try it
1780 bag Hertz oh wow that looks like it
works watch our score though 20 3 4 6 0
our previous high score was 22 6 5 9 you
can see how that would be a bit
deflating if you get those numbers after
doing all that effort on the mod because
it comes out to be a difference of 3.5%
and that's jumping from whatever the 9
percent offset is it's hard to tell that
to 22 the 1780 megahertz clock ok so
there's where we are right now let's say
we increase this eventually do you can
see where I've kind of marked things we
eventually got 25,000 score which sounds
really damn good that's a huge
improvement but fire strike started
outputting in grayscale the score was
going up because it was bugging out so
it's actually kind of a fake score
speaking with build Zoid when he did the
times by testing he was getting missing
geometry he was getting items and
display cases not showing up anymore and
the scores will look better because
there's stuff not being rendered so
that's either some kind of bug in the
colon or a bug in the drivers or
something going wrong obviously it's not
a stable overclock though so let's look
at the highest numbers we did 1980
megahertz 990 megahertz
HBM 2 we know 9 idea
stable on hbm's units actually seems to
be real but 1980 on the core well that
sounds unrealistic in fact I just told
you it was unrealistic moment ago so
22,000 707 versus our previous score of
22 659 is an improvement of 4.6 percent
that improvement is not because we were
went to 2 gigahertz it's because we went
whatever a couple dozen megahertz over
maybe even a hundred megahertz over the
previous overclock in fact if we look at
twenty two thousand seven or seven and
the percent scaling of that versus the
alleged seventeen eighty megahertz which
had a score of 23 for 60 I had a
difference of 1% which is within test
variance of firestrike well within it in
fact because it varies like a hundred
points sometimes in these runs alone
more than that depending what you're
doing so we're not 1% difference going
from one point seven eight gigahertz to
one point 9 8 gigahertz
that's a 200 megahertz change and that
comes out to about an 11 percent
increase in clock for a 1% increase in
score
doesn't that sound wrong that's why this
is a problem so it's a clock bug and
really all it comes down to is you need
to run a test here just like I was doing
with all these numbers every time you
change the clock let's see if it
increased if it didn't increase
reasonably then you've encountered the
bug and it's time to revert back to the
last known score that actually provided
a reasonable increase in fact if you do
this enough it's possible you run into
scenarios where your highest clock
so-called is actually performing worse
than the previous clock to the point
where if you look down here
high-potential II reset to 1500 over 990
and saw that there was no score decrease
and found out another bug which was that
afterburner wasn't adjusting DP m6 it
was only adjusting DP m7
so if that's happening that he's got
another problem and he's reset
everything or going to wat man which was
more reliable although still produced
the same bug we're at 1500 alleged
megahertz we're heading us towards was
the same as
our 1780 megahertz core and then we
rebooted did it all again I was a lot
man and fifteen hundred megahertz 990
HBM we're still hitting 22,000 800
points which is like the same as 90% of
these other scores so you can see the
bug that's what's going on with this
situation and the clocking on Vega it's
all the saucers lying to you
hopefully the drivers fix it maybe this
officer needs updates but that many
drivers need updates anyway because
every call you can kind of buggy and
it's been a process to do it but just be
aware of these issues and you'll be fine
as far as people reporting that they're
hitting 1900 plus megahertz on the clock
which some reviews have done those are
wrong and this is why so I think that
adequately explains the issue so that's
the Vega clock bug basically if you want
to validate your overclocks right now
you should do it the way Andy was
suggesting that we do it before we
posted our review which is validate
based on performance that means that you
want to run your game benchmark or fire
strike or time spy or whatever it is run
that before overclocking run it after
each overclocked interval logs the
performance and then run another
overclocked interval and log that
performance if you see an improvement in
performance it means that the overclock
is working and that the clock is still
actually increasing and not just lines
view if you see that it stagnates or
even drops below stock and performance
then you've encountered this frequency
bug and if that's the case you should
basically just reset everything and go
back to the last clock that was
successful at which point you'll have a
functional overclock with software that
is probably still lying to you but is
lying to you in a way that isn't
dragging your clock down below whatever
stock maybe that's what we're looking at
right now for the clock bug this should
be fixed at some point Andy has been
aware of it since we were working on the
review for Vega 56 at least if not
before then build Zoid I believe has
talked about it in his 50 minute long
rant about Vega so we're just trying to
bring some attention to this because we
keep seeing people report numbers that
they've overclocked the card to do
gigahertz
and everyone's like that's amazing
why is there only a 14% performance
increase because it didn't actually go
to two gigahertz so I think that's it
for this one
