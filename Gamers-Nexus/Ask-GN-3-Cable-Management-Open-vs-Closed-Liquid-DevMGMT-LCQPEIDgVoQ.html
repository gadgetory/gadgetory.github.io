donna and we are back for the third
episode of ask GN which as some of you
already know we take comments from
youtube twitter facebook wherever and
take a few of those and then try to
answer them in video form so that is
what we're doing today we just got back
from pax prime 2015 and that trip was
preceded by a tour of Logitech's audio
studio which is actually it's really
cool it's more than studio it's an
engineering lab and we walked into an
anechoic chamber which cancels basically
all of the sound and echoing that you
get naturally off of walls and from
people's voices very cool stuff a lot of
that's already on the channel and all of
its already on the website so definitely
check that out a couple of cool things
we saw at PAX would include on the
software side we saw rollercoaster
tycoon that was a big hit in terms of
content so Sword Coast legends and a
couple of other games battleborn what
have you and we liked some of them we
found so not mediocre but we'll continue
covering those as things progress so
let's jump into the questions for ask GN
episode 3 first of all this is a pretty
easy one this is a question from VG a
couple days ago and VG says I have the g
9 10 keyboard and when I plugged it in
the lights got on and stuff but it
cannot type yes it can lower volume
please help please help smiley face so I
don't know if this will resolve this
specific issue but it is something that
I wanted to make a point of in a video
or an article because this is actually
pretty useful tip for everyone doing
anything with system builds when you
have issues with a keyboard or mouse or
other primary input device not detecting
or not working the first thing you
should do is move it to the top USB slot
on the motherboard so your motherboard
has multiple controllers that handle USB
and I oh and one of those controllers is
going to communicate directly with with
the CPU work directly with CP you know
aftermarket soldered board stuff going
on that one is the one that occupies the
top two or a few other slots in the
motherboard on the i/o
panel on the output of the motherboard
so you should connect your input devices
to that slot and that should resolve it
I would think it would resolve this
issue because this does sound exactly
like that where the keyboard is
effectively receiving power for Gigi's
keyboard because it's displaying the
lights but no input is being received by
the system which tells me there's like a
controller issue or a driver issue in
Windows somewhere with installation so
that would be the first thing I would do
and that's a useful tip for anyone who's
having issues with input detection on a
new build and then the next thing you
should do is install all the drivers and
if you think you already have them then
open up the vice manager and
double-check and this is something that
everyone if you haven't already you
should all do it right now anyway if you
just open a run prompt by doing with a
Windows key + R and then type in dev
MGMT MSC de vie MGMT de MSC that will
open device manager click through all
those make sure there are no yellow
Bane's or red x's and if there aren't
great if there are go install that
device driver because you could be
losing out on solid-state drive
performance say to performance in that
instance or i/o controls or other things
like that it's a very common issue with
system built the next question is from
just sayin and just sayin says would 650
watts be enough for an R 93 90 and FX
8320 the short answer is yes and that's
really the only answer we didn't see
much more power draw than 400 watts or
in that range for the r9 390 depending
on which one you're using and if you're
overclocking when configured with an
intel cpu the 8320 draws a bit more
power but you're still well under that
600 watt window you do want sixty to
eighty percent power efficiency with a
or i should say sixty to eighty percent
power utilization excuse me with a power
supply to get maximum efficiency so
you're still within that range even with
that configuration and that's about
where you should be really and it gives
you some room to upgrade in the future
if you're moving to the 9000 series
that's a little bit different because
they're 220 watts CPUs and they have
some special requirements but for an
8320 you're fine
this question is pretty law and it's
kind of a two-part question I'll try to
answer all of it and it is by Ibaka
genius 1001 who says I helped a lot of
friends with their first gaming builds
awesome keep doing that a lot of the
time building is spent on cable
management I agree with that and making
the build look decent do you have any
tricks for quick and easy cable
management for example an order you
connect components to make routing and
tying cables behind the motherboard
easier so that's part one and we do have
a video on this it's a bit outdated and
I've changed my technique substantially
since then so I it's still worth seeing
but we've definitely changed a lot since
producing that video so the order of
components is something that does help a
lot actually in my experience and what I
do is I always install the video card
last for starters that's the easiest
thing to do because you want to route
those cables last they're skinnier than
the 24 pin cable makes them easier to
work with and it also means that if
you're for some reason forced to route
cables under the video card like Ben
8-pin connector that can't stretch
behind the motherboard tray with a
larger case then you want to install the
card last so that you're not removing it
to do that halfway through the process
so that is my first tip for cable
management video card last in terms of
other components I normally do off the
top of my head I think I do power supply
is the first or the second depending on
how I feel about the motherboard fit and
then motherboard or power supply so one
of those two first and then after that
it's just basically I pre installed
around the CPU and the cpu cooler and
heatsink before mounting all of that
into the case so that makes things a lot
easier you're not going to be screwing
around with the cpu cooler screws which
are sometimes hard to get to once it's
already in a case especially if it's a
mid tower or smaller that's the easiest
thing you can do in terms of
installation order and then you kind of
throw their hard drives in whenever in
that process normally at the end with
the video card at the very end so the
next thing I would suggest for cable
management is start with the 24 pin and
see if it'll fit behind the motherboard
tray because a lot of
times with smaller cases it won't or
it'll be very tight and if it's tight
you want to make sure your routing the
other cases through different grommets
on the case they're different holes so
that it's not going under over the
24-pin and then definitely you'll want
to choose your case wisely because
that's the next best thing you can do so
a thing to look for in cases is where do
the 8-pin and for pin cpu power header
is route if it routes through the top of
the case there are normally three slots
on good cases where do you want the
eight pen to go through and that's
because motherboards have three
different places they put that a pin
header basically on all motherboards so
the only few cases that gives us right
currently are NZXT cases like that's 340
and some corsair cases but that's the
best thing to do get a good case and
then after that you want to start
routing the front panel connectors so
that would be your power switch reset
switch things like that I get all of
those and I izip tie them at the end so
if they're all held together I just
route it through one of the ground
what's at the bottom and I always zip
tie it to the hard drive cage
scaffolding will call it where it's a
straight line down so if you have that
in your case I would tie the front I owe
to that to kind of keep it hid in and
out of the way so that's kind of basic
what I would start with and then from
there you can buy things like cable
combs they're called which really neatly
handle the individually wrapped cables
so that's a really nice way to make the
cable setup look good and you can see
that in one of our packs videos where we
looked at a main gear system next
question in this two-parter what is the
actual performance difference between a
custom water cooling loop versus a
closed all-in-one solution like the
h100i so this isn't really linearly
comparable in a lot of ways because a
closed solution is super easy it's just
one component and it requires no real
effort to install over in a dish over at
original air cooler stocked cool or
whatever so with a closed-loop cooler
the main advantage is ease you can
install it very easily it still gives
you a lot of performance
and it's decent for overclocking all the
way up to pretty high level overclocking
an open loop cooler mostly looks really
cool and you can customize the fluid you
can customize the tubing make it rigid
which is really hard to do by the way to
bend the tubing and it just makes your
system look a whole lot better so that's
the main thing with open loop now
answering this question there is a
thermal impact I don't have benchmarks
for you but there is a thermal impact
because now with an open-loop cooling
solution you're routing the liquid
through multiple components so the CPU
the video card one video card to
potentially other things some other
board support liquid cooling for the vrm
and then back into the reservoir
radiators things like that depending on
your setup the liquid cooling and an
open solution can be better it can also
be warmer so it just depends on how you
set it up because you've got more
components on the loop so either way
definitely your video cards the RM on
the motherboard could be cooler and
that's probably the main advantage but
it really is mostly just looks and for
most users I would recommend an aio
closed-loop solution the last question
here for episode 3 of ask genes from
tran juan who says could you please
answer in detail how important is the
main board in terms of gaming is having
a high-end mainboard going to get you a
better gaming experience of thanks so
mainboard in this instance is the
motherboard both are correct terms to
use and the motherboard directly will
not impact your FPS and almost all
instances there are some cases where
through various contingencies this is
not true so for example the LGA 2011
boards there are some h2s boards with
extra pins that will give you additional
overclocking Headroom this is proven and
in that instance you would get greater
FPS because you have more room to
overclock but it's not just you by the
board and you instantly have plus ten
percent FPS it's not quite that simple
so the direct answer here is no you
won't have a better gaming experience
directly from your motherboard purchase
but again contingencies exists so if
you're buying a 50 on motherboard then
yeah I could absolutely impact your
experience because it might be bad or it
might have trouble
with power management which could cause
instability it will have difficulty
overclocking if it can even overclock at
all and it could just really deliver
unclean power to the CPU to the video
card things like that which produce in
stable clock rates in stable driver to
component communication and things like
that so yes it can impact experience but
not directly so generally if you're
buying a decent board meeting probably
in the 70 plus dollar price range you're
going to be okay and you can have about
the same gaming experience as someone
who bought $150 board where this differs
is with again overclocking with your
memory configuration in bios with other
bios utilities with flashing with
support for additional storage devices
additional controllers on the
motherboard for those devices or io
basically aftermarket ICS and
controllers on the board that augment or
add to or amplify what the chipset is
natively capable of so that would be
additional USB 3 headers additional i/o
in the back stuff like that so that's
where you get your main advantage with
buying a more expensive motherboard I do
definitely recommend by at least a
decent board I wouldn't go to dirt cheap
because it will bite you in the end but
you don't need to buy one hundred and
fifty two hundred dollar motherboard for
every system build especially if
overclocking is not of interest to you
if I were clogging is of interest to you
it is very important that you buy a
board with quality components because
the vrm which is comprised of capacitors
chokes MOSFETs and the heatsink the vrm
you want to be high quality you wanted
to have enough phases to clean the power
delivery to the cpu to bruce a stable
overclock you want to run cool so that
the vrm heat sinks are not just
incinerating here your other nearby
components like memory for instance and
you just want it to actually overclock
well and in bios the amount of options
available to you is dictated by what the
motherboard manufacturer supplies what
their firmware
capable of so that is another item to
look at one of our test boards i believe
is an asus rog board and that has a ton
of options for memory tuning all the way
down to fourth or fifth level timings so
that does is that allows us to mix and
match in our case three different kits
of memory you should not do this ever
but we're doing it because we had three
different kids in memory they're all
very good and we wanted to use 64
gigabytes so in this instance we had
spent a few hours tweaking and tuning
all the memory settings in bios to get
them to run together without crashing
and that's something you can only really
do with a high on board so that's an
instance where the use case actually
does make sense but hopefully that
answers it spending two hundred dollars
in short will not just boost your FPS
it's not that simple overclocking
different story you should spend more on
a board that is actually going to be
good for it so that is all for this ask
GN episode 3 i'm freshly packed from pax
and the logitech tour and the short trip
to whistler and a few other things so
it's been a long week we've taken a
short break from video content and i
hope you've enjoyed everything you've
seen so far if you have more questions
for us for ask GN please post them below
in the comments because i check this
video first when i'm trying to compile
questions for the sgn video not that we
have a huge tenure of that but you know
it's starting as for patreon we're up to
quite a few backers now i think it might
be 13 so huge health it's really
exciting to see more backers join us on
patreon I know Keegan who works on the
videos and I are both really happy to
see support building outside of
traditional advertising revenue which is
very difficult to come by these days and
direct support from the community this
kind of cleaner anyway and makes for
easier content production without the
different things that advertising may
bring with it so huge thanks to everyone
who has supported us on there we're
trying to get some new stuff together
for you guys like a chat room for
community supporters and direct access
to us our editors for support with
system building and troubleshooting and
things like that if you're interested in
being one of those people hit the link
in the post roll video otherwise
subscribe to the channel
out all the other videos let us know
what questions you have for next time
and I will see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
