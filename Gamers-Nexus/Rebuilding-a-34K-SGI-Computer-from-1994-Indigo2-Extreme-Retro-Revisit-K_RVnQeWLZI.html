special project so this is the SGI
indigo 2 extreme the SGI indigo two
extreme they were sent to us by ian from
SGI depot and they're really cool so
this is basically the the graphics card
this is more or less the graphic
solution this is the extreme part of the
Indigo 2 extreme and from what I at
least from aw Ian tells us and he is an
expert on this stuff this system I think
was $34,000 when it came out to be clear
we did not pay that for the system but
these were like SGI was a really
high-end graphics solution provider was
one of the first and if not basically
the first in any kind of wide reaching
manner and worked a lot with I think the
the film industry yeah maybe some others
and so Patrick's joining me today we're
gonna build these and after we get them
built we'll test them and see what kind
of graphics they were capable of because
these for the time were really high-end
systems so we'll see
I believe these even have one of them
has blender on it so we'll see how that
does before that this video is brought
to you by be quiet and there's straight
power 11 high-end power supply be quiet
straight power 11 focuses heavily on
silence at the high performance using
the silent wanes 3 135 millimeter fan
for efficient cooling at low noise
levels and incapable of 200 rpm startup
fees for quieter low load noise levels
than most power supplies on the market
the straight power 11 offers LLC
synchronous rectifying DC to DC
transformation and comes in capacities
from 450 Watts up to a thousand watts
with a 1,000 watt unit being the one
we're showing today learn more about
these high quality power supplies of the
link in the description below so
Patrick's been working on this stuff for
the past week or so and knows a lot more
about it than I do let's let's go over
the specs of this one that we have here
this is the the Indigo 2 extreme we also
have an o2 that we'll be building today
and this I think was the earlier model
yes chronologically so what 90 this one
came out in 93 but the spec we have here
is 94 more like these are all spare
parts that UN had around so they're not
systems as they shipped straight from
the factory right but this is more of a
95
model okay so then we have a 12 sticks
of RAM I think yes I think this is 96
Meg's total in this one split among
twelve six obviously yeah which are
mismatched whichever ones he had lying
around right do we know that if it's
like multi-channel there are three
groupings here ring-a-ring Bering Sea so
for a motherboard layout we have I guess
what I would call the motherboard at the
bottom I don't know if they use the same
terms but I think is a CPU under this
giant yeah yeah so there's a 200
megahertz or 4000 yeah okay this is I
think from what we were reading it's a
mips technologies architecture I don't
know that we know who made this specific
CPU next we could probably look yeah we
could probably pop that heatsink off
there's another one in the box if we
don't want to do that one but yeah we
might as well do it there's one fan in
the system we can show that actually
it's really here on the other side of
the table at least as it was shipped to
us but this fan the graphics assembly
goes right here and then the CPU is on
the other side of it right you'll see a
little bit but so this will sock it how
does this does this it goes in right
here it's pockets here and yeah okay so
that'll sock it in there when we're done
and then that fan is a pole
configuration pull the air through the
cards so I don't I think this I'm a
little scared to take this off honestly
I don't know how like how it dried that
paste is if there is paste yeah there's
another one in there that we can mess
around with as well
um as you can see Ian has carefully
labeled every component yes Ian iron Ian
you if you're watching you have the most
impressive documentation I've ever seen
in my life and in the best way possible
it made things a lot easier for us so
even runs SGI depot which i don't know
did you look at the site I guess it's
like yeah little bit yes it has a bunch
of information on all the old SGI parts
I think does he sell some too yeah I'm
not sure if that's his main job but he
lists a lot of parts for sale either for
collectors or businesses that need
replacement parts to keep systems
running yes so believe it or not a lot
of businesses that have these systems I
guess was it medical he said medical
imaging they had a lot of government
contracts like defense ok uses but I
would hope that the military isn't using
new it hopes that's yes this is anymore
yeah typically though I guess there's
two certain types of medical or
enterprise clients once they have
something working they really don't want
to change it so yeah you can I guess
some of these are still kind of used out
there in the wild and also I think a lot
of the software since the operating
system was specific to this hardware and
then the software that was written for
that operating system is specific to its
hardware it's difficult to switch away
from that yeah it's a specific
architecture yeah ok cool ok a little
nervous on that cuz I don't I know
nothing about how these are assembled so
here's the bottom side I mean we're we
said we're building this but I guess
we're actually taking it apart first
mm-hm what do we even I guess I'll just
pull the heatsink off if I can oh I see
okay so there's two more we pass this to
you okay
not sure what we're gonna find under
here yeah we haven't actually uh opened
that up yes I think that's all the
screws
this board can take up to 384 megabytes
of RAM while the later motherboard
revision has a maximum of one gigabyte
using the later and much faster or 1000
you say one gigabyte one gigabyte that's
a lot actually but not with the CPU okay
so it's Intelli intel 3175 back style
except a couple decades earlier nice oh
man that is some dust yeah we mine
didn't need to do a little maintenance
before you turn this back on I can't
yeah yes okay so there's an o-ring all
right cool and a thermal pad we could
replace that with a mm-hmm
I see diamonds they're all bad good put
a real heat think on it that's you know
right so the casting yes so just decimal
no no me heatsink comes down and touches
the I guess that's the CPU and there
should be a brand on there if you wipe
it off yeah yeah this like snake colored
Orion on the outside was kind of
preventing us from getting it all the
way off Oh get it off as best I can and
then we'll replace it with something
that's like 40 dollars he'll be and
recently made so it'll be a high-end
solution Toshiba Toshiba
so MIPS is responsible for the
architecture and then toshiba made the
actual hardware yeah so this is a I
guess you can think of it kind of like
arm or you've got that's actually glued
in some spots
MIPS doing the arc work there's the
Toshiba part and it looks like it's
socketed it seems like it we actually um
we have a nun socketed one in here think
this is an AR 10,000 maybe so there's
the unsalted version of what we're
working with well different different
ckio you can see that IHS is a lot
bigger
let's call Roman and there's the bottom
side I think he said that one was
functional I think we have some that are
very similar to that yeah from our
viewers an appearance always alright so
this is captain tape this is sometimes
referred to as thermal tape it is
neither electrically nor not really
thermally conductive either so I'm using
this just to protect the SMDs I'm gonna
throw that icy diamond pad on there I
don't want it to conduct anything
because it's conductive I didn't
actually go into the BIOS but he points
out that smells good oh really yeah okay
there are about 20 years ahead of their
time on that URI if I didn't happen to
like 28 2009 so this is just a temporary
solution to kind of protect it while I'm
messing around with it we're just gonna
see if the if there's an indent on the
IC diamond pad if there is then we know
it's making contact and we can use it
all right so now let me take it back off
yeah that make contact for sure so yeah
you can see the indent of the CPU nice
alright so this is going to get quite
the upgrade I guess I totally want to
put that in
I'll just buy another one I guess well I
guess if he and wash was this video he
can compile a list of our questions as
we go and then answer that for us I want
to make clear for the audience that I am
being abnormally careful with this
though so if you're one of the people
who's like oh my god Steve why do you
always quote unquote slam the video card
on the table you will note that I'm Hin
and being gentle with this one they were
not built to quite the same standards in
terms of being tossed around even like
ESD standards were not as good yeah
double-bag everything and yes tea bags
and then bubble wrap outside about yes
is very thorough all right cool
so it it survived surgery and I think
once I get these four screws and Batra
can start probably working on I don't
know what's what's the next memory or
something else oh yeah we can put the
memory back in so yeah from memory we
have what you say was 96 yeah and I
think it's evenly split this is pretty
pretty cool so yeah graphic solution I
don't know a whole lot about it actually
you know what I have a good paragraph
from Wikipedia on this so well Patrick's
working on the memory here's a wikipedia
says about the graphic solution I'm just
gonna direct quote it it says extrema
graphic systems that was the
architecture extreme graphics extreme
graphic systems that consist of eight
geometry engines and two raster engines
twice twice as many units as the Elan XZ
graphics used in the Indy indigo and
indigo to the eighth geometry engines
are rated at two of these six mega flops
maximum far faster than the mips are
4,400 CPUs in the workstation
it also says extreme graphics consists
of five graphics subsystem so that's the
command engine this is still used today
geometry subsystem sort of still used
today raster engines still used and
frame buffer and a display subsystem it
can do 1280 by 1024 and 24-bit color and
also does unencoded ntsc NP al so that's
the extreme graphics system and
architecture I guess and this is the
board so this is pretty cool because
it's three layers like a sad so you've
got three layers and then set of pins on
this side that socket between those two
there's a set of pin socketing between
these two boards another set of pins
down here and then this right here is
your actual socket to the whatever that
I guess l-shaped connector board is that
we showed you earlier with the fan on it
and these are all LSI branded chips I
honestly am NOT I'd have to do some
research what they are you have to
achieve a branded stuff over here I'm
guessing that's maybe memory I don't
know that's I think this is just eight
screws to get apart same fit as the CPU
or I'm a little ok hesitant alright cool
so we're gonna need to remember the
order of these going
I guess shouldn't only go in one way
really so here's the first board I know
nothing about it Silicon Graphics of
course branding in the center we have
some giant LSI modules and I don't know
if those are the GPUs I see some more at
the bottom we I mean again to clarify
this is from 90 something 95 96 93 or 94
93 or 94 okay so even earlier so I I
know nothing about this stuff I'm not
gonna pretend to but that's what it
looks like in the middle an SGI we've
said this before but Jenson Haun used to
work there founder of Nvidia and
departed because he disagreed with SGI
on a few things like SGI didn't really
see so era consumer graphics as a a
major market opportunity and he
and that's gi's bankrupt now and ended
by HP and NVIDIA is a successful company
so yes alright middle board top board
that's pretty cool so we've I I was
doing some preliminary research on the
graphic solution I found some articles
that were in magazines that had been
scanned and uploaded and they were
scanned and uploaded in 1998 and they
were not particularly in-depth we didn't
have we didn't have an on on and
shrimpie writing about these types of
things yet so I didn't know we're here
to go look HPC had some content anyway
that's the graphic solution
I'll reassemble this and then we'll
finalize the assembly of this system
what are the other parts eat I guess do
you want to walk through some of these
other parts on the table we have all
this stuff but this needs to be lifted
slightly so that you can put in the EIS
a backplane okay and that's not the way
that goes like this and if you made a
point that other than this cable right
here and both of the systems that he
mailed to us there's not really any
cabling it's all socketed was unable for
the scuzzy there's an optical drive that
we didn't use or didn't send but it also
connects the boot drive okay see so it's
the backplane it has a lot of slots in
here of which we were using I think only
one for the graphics orange no yeah he
also sent this star birdies not for
consumption these have a very important
role in all of this very technically
supposed to rest under the fan right
there because otherwise this backplane
isn't supported
yes so he says this early revision black
plane has three g io 64 slots 64-bit 33
megahertz 264 megabytes per second
kind of like PCIe a PCI and not these
yeah he not PC and 4 E is a slots right
here that's I think that's what the
think we're using these did you say is a
no we're using these ie is yes the later
impact version has four g io 64 slots
and three E is a slots but both versions
have only had two logical Jo slots and
then there was a custom one with more
slots enabling the use of dual max and
poetic graphic sets and those are the
really high-end ones this is the extreme
graphic set I think max impact is the
highest end that goes in these systems
right so this is just one step down I
guess strumming or is it I think it's
one step down it's like the mid-range
okay what's next
sake in the card we can yes we can put
the card in um I can remember which way
it goes yes it would make sense for it
to go I think yes with the slots
oriented towards the slots and over
there no okay
I was wrong it wouldn't make sense for
to go that way wouldn't have but it
doesn't okay so yeah these supports
right here just hold my the edges of the
PC and the fan pulls air through there
you have some flexibility with where to
connect this but he recommended putting
it in just the top slot okay hmm so
there we go
this isn't supported super well and yeah
yeah we don't have the case but that's
why this candy thing is here to hold up
to that point I'm sure we could do
better than that but that is what Ian
recommended yeah and it's the metal
supports here holding the graphic said
cool okay so now we have
remember this is 13 w3 to VGA adapter so
obviously this is not standard standard
thing that we can plug into a monitor
even the VGA signal is something that
doesn't work with most of our monitors
it's a sync on green signal yes we're
using actually a an early 2000s 1280 by
1024 monitor yeah for this and that
seems to work pretty well actually yeah
um it doesn't align in super well with
this one but you can just manually
remove the image yeah now attach the
host ID and i/o ports backplane module
so this has the IO four keyboard and
mouse as he's very carefully labeled but
it also contains the hardware MAC
address IC for the machine which is used
by flex LAN for software licensing so
there's a socket here or what yes it's
like it's on right there see um
there's a group of pins back here and
how does it does it align a specific way
yeah that's right yeah okay it's like a
USB 3 header except Ammar fragile yeah
so theoretically you could upgrade any
of the hardware in here and not have to
buy new licenses but he says people did
their own custom walkouts anyway
no of course okay all right cool so that
is mostly sound we have a speaker left
yes Drive we have the power supply over
here which is pretty awesome socketed
also yeah just since this is all on a
piece of cardboard it's pretty easy to
move around I can tell the power
supplies in there we shouldn't test this
on the power supply tester if you can
figure out I guess the voltages are
labeled yeah it's
uh-huh so this will the power supply
will connect to these pins here yeah I
believe okay I'm sure he has a little
bit more trouble running these because I
don't know yeah in the UK right I don't
know if there's a switch on there for UK
power line up these here we have the
outputs by the way I'll read these out
because they're kind of interesting
output so we have 120 to 240 volt and it
says outputs are +5 volts at 40 amps 12
volts at 12 amps minus 12 at 1 amp 3.3
at 12 amps minus 5 at 1 amp and 5 arcs
at 1 amp so there's your power supply
spec so I guess you could you could add
those together and figure out the
maximum power but either way it's built
for the system so we're not gonna be
underpowered
so this is our scuzzy backplane this is
a massive ferrite core yes that is
gigantic ferrite core so this just goes
right here there's one connection to the
motherboard right here and it is powered
with molex okay it's the only other
power connector that doesn't go straight
into the motherboard so we use that
that's for the drive you said our well
that's for an optical drive this thing
this part this goes to the optical drive
there would be one mounted in the case
right here but it's not necessary he
says and normal use you would transfer
most of the files over the network
anyway okay what about this one
next scuzzy link assembly scuzzy ribbon
cable this the board what's kind of
alarming it's having unplugged cables
but you know trust in you and then I
believe this is this would be for the
optical drive for the OS call on this hi
Rick's
Irish that's right it's unix system v
but it's a custom flavor of it I guess
Florida SGI and then this is the system
speaker which is the only LED I think in
the entire system and mono audio well
obviously
but all the sound comes out through
there unless you uh I guess you would
have to hook up an audio board because
I'm not sure there's any audio outputs
on here right but yeah this this should
be as it is yes so this is the system
this is the Indigo 2 extreme there's the
extreme part this is an r4 you say 4000
or four hundred four thousand two
hundred Hertz processor MIPS
architecture and we have our 96
what is it megabytes of RAM yeah the
unit of measurement was some 96
megabytes of RAM power supply is
connected so here's our system then at
this point we are we're just going to
plug it in look at the OS go through
some of the software on there and we'll
show you what the the software looks
like and what kind of graphics
capabilities this had for the time is
actually some of it's pretty cool
this one I believe has doom on it is
that right yes that one has doom on it
and the o2
the o2 were gonna build in a separate
video so make sure you subscribe to
catch the second one we are gonna look
through this software here today though
but the o2 I believe has quake yes work
week two has quake on it definitely it
might also have great not ray-traced
and do him on this one that we have
blender to look at some other stuff so
yes let's let's go look at the software
as we boot this thing up quick history
lesson
SGI was founded in 1981 from then until
the early 90s it was an enormous ly
successful company famously supplying
the hardware responsible for cgi effects
in many movies maya was originally
exclusive to the SGI operating systems
and so had big pull but it was also used
for government and defense applications
anything to do with manipulating tons of
data huge images or 3d in general was
the domain of SGI until 3d graphics made
its way into x86 systems and SGI's
position was challenged as a ian
summarized quote they dropped the ball
with later updates that did limit their
eventual success SGI is failure to
remain competitive led to its stock
being delisted in 2005 with declaration
of bankruptcy
2006 the company continued to exist for
several years after that but that was
the end of the SGI that anyone bothers
to talk about HP is the current owner of
whatever remains after multiple
bankruptcies and acquisitions the
operating system installed on both
systems is eirick s-- today we're just
looking at the indigo 2 extreme which
uses the iris 6.2 version OS I Rick's is
a UNIX based operating system developed
specifically for SGI systems you can see
it in use here we have some capture
footage of it technically the last
update shipped in August 2006 but the
last major revision was in 1998 IREX is
a variant of the UNIX system V r4 which
is several branches removed from Mac OS
X maybe it's unix system v r4 i don't
know but anyway it's far removed from
the Mac OS X OS or anything that any non
masochistic gamer might be interested in
using since SGI's hardware wasn't
intended for that purpose the games
included by Ian quake and doom are
mostly hobbyist supports consider that
the difficulty of running third-party
software runs both ways emulating SGI
machines is an ongoing effort so for the
time being physical hardware is the only
practical way to run iris or the
applications that run on it both systems
sent to us use mips processors as did
almost all other SGI systems until their
final years when the company switched to
x86 Itanium and xeon based systems ian
loaded up the hard drive with 3d demos
before he sends it over to us as he
pointed out this is impressive stuff for
a system that launched in 1993 the 3d
graphics you can see in our demos are
enabled by that three layer extreme
graphic set that was sent along SGI made
multiple different graphic sets
including the high end max impact that
we don't have here SGI chose not to make
any consumer gaming GPUs though and
those that wanted to left to join Nvidia
Newton is probably the most convenient
demonstration of what the 3d graphics
hardware and the Indigo 2 can do it's a
simple application that allows
manipulating and bouncing soft body
objects in real time with a bunch of
controllable variables more conventional
rendering softer like blender and BM RT
are also good fits Maya was included on
very
versions of SGI hardware as well lumen
rendering tools was used for multiple
Pixar movies and eventually led to the
Nvidia gelato renderer Cosmo worlds is
an interesting piece of software for
editing VRML or virtual reality modeling
language this was intended to be the
file format for 3d vector graphics on
the web although the world has since
moved not button-fly is another good
demo on the system and is sort of
similar to the 3d vector graphics demo
it's a 3d GUI with completely
unnecessary animations for launching
other demos and files as for games since
this isn't a top spec into go to the
selection is limited SGI runs Doom kind
of okay but doom isn't considered a 3d
game from a rendering standpoint and
therefore it doesn't really show off the
capabilities of the system when we look
at the o2 our next SGI system build will
have a couple of other software
solutions to look at as well including
some blender benchmarks that we ran on a
modern system in 8600 k vs the o2 that's
kind of interesting just for some charts
and then we'll also be looking at quake
which is on our oat ooh so thanks for
watching we will see you all in the next
one make sure you subscribe to catch the
o2 system build with Patrick as well you
go to store documents actions done that
or patreon.com slash gamers next to
stuff that directly and there's a view
on patreon did you get to see a behind
the scenes an early look at this so
we'll be publishing more behind the
scenes stuff like that
pretty soon thanks for watching we'll
see you all next time welcome to the
guided tour of your indigo magic user
environment this tour introduces you to
the features and functionality of this
environment and teaches you how to use
many of the tools to get started place
