GN episode we have three we're shooting
today probably one of them will be the
patreon ass Jenna will be up on the
patreon channel so you go to
patreon.com/scishow to get access to
that one if you want to but for this one
we're on episode 100 now and for that we
are doing nothing special if you have
questions as always leave them in the
comment section below
so that we can look at them for next
time we'll be talking about GPUs today
so end of life for pascal is it here or
not yet and a couple of other excellent
questions from you all and we also have
some art that we'll be talking about
before that this video is brought to you
by the EVGA CLC 280 liquid cooler people
ask me how I keep cool during the summer
with all this hair well I've tried a lot
of different products and a few do
exactly what I need many of them cause
tangles or worse EVGA CLC 280 helps keep
my core temperatures lower they're in
hot benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
so for the art we we talked in the news
video about wanting to put up some art
on the walls mostly old hardware from a
lot of you have sent old CPU stuff like
that really looking forward to getting
those in so we putting that up in frames
on the wall and stuff like that think
we'll also frame this this is an old
dead a m3 motherboard that we've had for
a long time and we did some thermal
paste experiments on the socket I think
we're just gonna frame it and explain
how it's abstract art I don't know man
walking down alleyway sounds like a good
title for that one if you have stuff you
want to send us though for consideration
we have a P o box now I'll include it in
the description below you can send stuff
there if you want to email us and ask if
we already have whatever you're thinking
of sending feel free to do that but yeah
so looking forward to seeing what you
have maybe we can frame it no guarantee
we'll be on video but we do need some
art for the office and old hardware
makes a lot of sense also by the way
stored on cameras axis net to get on the
backorder list for the mod match they're
on the way in for the next round so
alright first question is from a bunch
bird
says I enjoy ass yen because it contains
answers to difficult questions and
questions that I didn't know I even
wanted to ask sure one could google this
stuff but that doesn't help when I don't
even know I have a question I included
this because last week we had a guy
asking about why we don't have questions
that you can't just google the answer to
even though Google has pretty much
everything access to everything that I
would know anyway but this is actually a
really good point and not when I thought
of which is that these videos I guess
help you figure out what you even want
to ask so thank you to everyone who has
posted questions that benefit the
community please continue to do so in
the comments below first real question
here is from crizzley bear who says
following up from a recent video is
Pascal already end-of-life I haven't
found any info on that see in the price
of a 20 80 TI I think it's wise to save
up for buying a GPU next or if 1080 T
eyes won't be available anymore say in
two months so yeah this is a great
question one that always comes up when
there's a new launch of a product is it
end-of-life there's no firm official
information from Nvidia yet I'll just
put that out there first NVIDIA has not
officially in any of its investor
meetings as far as I'm aware said we are
Chilean production of whatever part so
no official information but I was able
to talk to a few people and I have of
course my own thoughts as well on this
and the thing with Pascal is there's a
lot of it out there because Nvidia
overbought for mining ended up with a
whole lot of inventory that's been
getting dumped on the board partners and
board partners have to get rid of it so
that's why you're seeing like 1080 eyes
and 1080 s at a lower price than is
typical and that's not gonna last
forever so if you've been in the
industry while you've seen CV prices GPU
prices tend to actually go up as a
product goes AOL and I don't know
exactly why that is I it's because you
can't get it anymore I guess and I don't
know if maybe business users are think
that you have to buy exactly the same
part when the old one dies I don't know
but typically the prices go up not down
right now they are down because there's
so much oversupply of Pascal that will
not last forever so as far as is it AOL
we asked around and as we understand
right now Pascal is sort of on hold
Nvidia still has the capability to
produce more if they wanted to it's not
officially eol but as I understand it
from our contacts ian in the industry in
the AIB side and we is not presently
making more Pascal GPUs because they
made too many anyway so it's not dead
yet
the 1060 end-up are especially
oversupplied right now so there's a lot
of 10 60 70 80 and 80 TI and the 20 60
and 20 50 launch aren't happening today
it's just the 20 80 and the TI right now
which those will influence which parts
go TL as well the lower end Pascal parts
will keep being made on while assuming
they sell through them until those parts
launch it's the 1080 TI that'll go away
first and we're not sure on when the
1080 in 10 sony will go away but
definitely the 1080 TI is one of the
first to go end-of-life and that is
probably going to happen around quarter
for potentially inventory my dwindle and
October and that's just based on the
current supply and the current high
demand because the response to our GX
pricing from the community was so severe
that our prediction in the prediction of
our contact is that Pascal will remain a
good seller up until the point that RT
acts potentially becomes more affordable
or has benchmarks to support the price
that it is asking so you'll see a lot of
Pascal sales up through October and then
at that point supply will dwindle and
we're not sure how much will be left but
q4 it looks like AOL for the TI most
likely and then for the 1080 and 1070
we're not clear those will take a bit
longer to clear out and get rid of so
those might be around a little while
longer than the T is 10 60 and down no
idea because there's no RT extra
placement yeah and that's by the way
another thing we were looking at is will
the RT X branding be removed from the
lower end cards because it's not a 2060
will almost certainly not have the
horsepower required to do ray tracing
the way that a 20 70 80 80 TI can do so
will they revert to GTX branding because
it won't have that capable
it might have the capability in terms of
tennis courts but will have the
necessary horsepower to drive graphics
at a reasonable resolution and still
rate race so that that impacts branding
I'm presently one of my one of my
theories is that we might see some
Pascal refresh is at the very low end
like a 2050 2050 TI 2060 something like
that because if those are still
perfectly good parts and they still have
a lot of them margins high easy to make
then no there's no reason that Nvidia
might not consider taking a 1070 TI or
something or 1080 and turning it into a
2060 but anyway as far as the answer to
your question it's not ul yet Pascal
1080 eyes will die first and I'll
probably October two quarter four when
you start seeing prices go the other
direction potentially as supply dwindles
and then 1080s will be a bit later
because there's more of them in the
channel next one fuddy-duddy says within
videos are txseries focusing mostly on
the new tensor driven technologies will
that mean reviewers will have to
approach reviews differently I can
understand that in apples to apples
comparison would still be prudent
so rasterization only no tensor features
but if these tensor chords can unburden
the CUDA cores with features like DL SS
and thus improve frame 8 versus say a
four tap MSA a set up on a regular GPU
would that be fair given the caveats at
the start of the video which referring
to last week's video I think so yeah
it's it's going to change a bit the type
of tests we do but I can't speak for
other reviewers I can tell you what
we're gonna do for RTX we are definitely
still doing rasterization normal
benchmarks because all the games we test
most games on the market today are still
without any rage facing features at all
so we'll still be testing those it's
really important because it gives you a
firm answer to how well does it perform
versus pascal kepler max well in a
normal game which would be in most of
your library today so when a new card
comes out it's not like you only play
games that that card is built to work
with and we're gonna be testing the old
games and the new games as they
those are a bit scarce right now but
we'll test them as soon as I think Tomb
Raider comes out next week a set of
course comes out next week and those are
supposed to have r-tx features so we
will be testing those it's just a
question of how does it perform versus
normal cards under normal circumstances
and one of the tests will be doing
certainly whether or not it's in the
review I can't tell you right now but
will be just the new games with r-tx
features disabled and test them serves
as a normal game so we'll test them
without any of the special and video
features on Pascal and on touring and
then we'll test and probably volta and
then we'll test them with those features
our TX features on the same suite of
cards and what does the scaling look
like how does it handle on Pascal is
there a visual game that's another thing
we have to look at so this is where to
your methodology question gets kind of
tricky in days past there was a time
when reviewers before I started
reviewing GPUs had to take comparison
shots of the games that are working on
because the different cards would render
the games in such a different way that
you had different quality visual quality
differences even though the framerate
still seems like a fixed number you can
measure and the settings might look the
same the way the cards were interpreting
the settings was different between
brands and that causes problems because
you can't quantitatively measure that
you have to do a comparison so we'll be
doing comparisons of our TX settings on
versus off on multiple generations at
least two so that we can see what is the
visual benefit even if if we know that
our TX processes the our TX feature is
the ray-tracing features MLS SML al
that's of significantly better than
other cards can okay cool but what value
does that give us when considering that
the the visual quality might actually
not be worth the performance hit so
that's something that we have to look
into and consider as well so yes it does
change our considerations for testing
quite a bit but we're still going to be
testing cards just like normally
thermals all be tested normally power
tested normally and rasterization games
will be tested normally
so we'll have a full picture of what's
going on just keep in mind some of this
stuff will come out in separate feature
pieces so it might not all be in the
initial review depending on time
restrictions of testing time available
and also the video duration but
hopefully that answers some of your
question yeah we'll be testing with them
with the features on and off and make
sure that it's all level for all the
tests and see how it does
next one middle quark says hi see great
channels great content thank you I have
a kind of odd question but I hope you
can help with some clarity given that
big power fluctuations are inevitable
when running a specific application
which of these two situations is better
for the longevity of a GPU specifically
or any other component in general
voltage fluctuation with stable amperage
or amperage fluctuation with stable
voltage let's also assume that the
voltage in both cases even when
fluctuating does not reach dangerous
levels from what I know in electronics
the voltage is the most dangerous of
variables however my concern is that a
continuous fluctuation in electrons and
specific weak wires on the PCB or inside
the GPU may cause more damage so first
of all yes voltages is definitely one of
the most dangerous variables if not the
most dangerous the thing with current
with amperage the GPU or the CPU RAM or
whatever it's only going to pull the
current that it needs and the voltage
will be supplied to it by a voltage
regulator or a power supply of some sort
and there are power supplies on graphics
cards as well so everything's pretty
much got a power supply of some kind
outside of just the actual PC power
supply that's supplying all of the power
for the computer so current is drawn for
a voltage the end fibers by the way can
complicate this a bit because integrated
fully integrated voltage regulators like
Intel CPUs do a bit of work as well but
anyway for volt did you want good power
regulation and good V RMS to ensure that
the supply is stable and then you need a
user who is not insane to make sure you
set a voltage that is safe so as long as
you're staying within the parameters of
the part and keeping the voltage
relatively safe and you have a good
power supply good voltage regulation
it'll be fine to answer your question
though of what causes more damage it's
going to be the voltage that
and kill stuff especially as you have
let's say you have a board that is it's
got a lot of ripple or video cards as
well have ripple issues to pay on the
VRM so the lower quality the vrm lower
quality the the power delivery of the
component you introduce potentially more
ripple this is true for power supplies
as well you introduce variance
fluctuation in the voltage supply and if
it spikes like let's say let's say you
did it yourself to yourself you use LLC
at too high of a level or something and
so load line calibration now instead of
dipping down when it wants to change
it's going to dip up it's going to spike
and that can cause damage to so you
might spike in a way that could be
detrimental to the CPUs longevity you
start looking at things like integrated
memory controllers or IMC's SOC s for
AMD and what kills those actually it
doesn't kill them it degrades them is
high voltage not current so if you're
pushing a higher voltage like one point
one point four si for example or even
that's a VSO see something like that 1.4
1.3 in that range it will degrade the
quality of the IMC over times over time
you'll be able to support a lower
frequency you might require a higher
voltage to support the same frequency
and that degradation is caused by
voltage by heat and of course current is
directly it correlates directly because
it's just voltage times amps gives you
watts so it's all part of the same
formula but voltage is the one that you
really need to be concerned about and I
for the most part even though we talked
about wanting good power regulation good
V RMS on a motherboard for the most part
any average board and up is going to be
fine unless you're really doing some
extreme overclocking but there are
definitely like low-end
bottom-of-the-barrel power supplies that
can cause damage and there are low and
boards that can cause damage it's just
you know as it kind of depends on how
you would be used it as well if you're
using a low-end board and trying to push
a high overclock it's not gonna end well
but yes voltage is the thing to be most
concerned about and the current you
don't have as much control over anyway
so just set the the voltage in a safe
manner next one
Marcus saw Mirka saw says how
as the resolution effect graphics card
power usage and by extension boost
clocks and temperatures I've noticed
that every card I've got and previously
owned sees higher power consumption and
lower boost clocks as resolution
increased my 1064 example hits its power
limit at 1440p and doesn't at 1080p
we're talking unlocked frame rate here
and my 1080 Ti also sees higher power
usage and therefore slightly reduced
clocks at 1080p versus 1080p the reason
is almost certainly because you are
hitting the CPU bound scenarios
potentially anyway the 1060 bit of a
question what so the we've we haven't
done this in a while but there was a
time when we were doing power tests we
clamped the cables say take a current
clamp you put it on the 12 volt cables
going into the video card and you can
measure the the current and so we did
that for power monitoring and I did test
1440 verse 4k and I think you in 1080i
one point and the difference is is very
little it's it's pretty marginal so a
lot of reason you start seeing big
differences is let's say we test 1080p
vs. 4k power consumption and we see like
a I don't know 20 30 watt difference in
power consumption the reason you might
see that the weights and you would see
that is not because of the GPUs workload
being any less severe it's because the
GP is not getting as much work because
the CPU is bottleneck in it so if you're
at a point where the CPU is the
bottleneck and so the GPUs sitting that
are waiting idle burnin cycles doing
nothing then yes it will consume less
power because it's burning cycles on
nothing and that's typically where you
see the difference not because the
resolution itself is actually different
in terms of how its processed on the GPU
as long as the GPU is loaded and
burdened in the same way and the CV is
not limiting it then you should see
roughly the same power consumption it's
it's within a couple of watts typically
I haven't tested that in about a year
but we did test it at one point next one
is from so I've got one question here
we're gonna throw to John for Johnny
guru as you all know him once he's
available and it's about how
uninterruptible power supplies impact
performance of a power supply and a PC
we don't have the answer for that yet so
we'll throw that to him when he's
available the next one though I need
brain in Andrew who is on our team and
he does a lot of 3d modeling 3d
animation rendering work and that
questions from liquid paper who asks
assuming that you could raytrace render
a game with no performance hit what are
the benefits of doing so relative to
traditional rendering I feel like no one
at least not Nvidia has really explained
why an end-user should care about ray
tracing or at least why doing so is
theoretically preferable over
traditional rendering performance hit
notwithstanding so first of all before I
bring Andrew in to discuss this with him
couple things ray tracing has NVIDIA has
presented its RR t XR DX cards they
don't just do ray tracing they also do
like a machine learning super sampling
which is upscaling the image and a
machine learning anti-aliasing they fall
under the r-tx suite but they are not
ray tracing technology so there are a
few different things anybody does your
global elimination is another one that
can leverage the tensor cores but don't
necessarily fall under the ray tracing
bucket and we'll talk about more about
what the SS NAA stuff means later if you
don't already know but we can talk about
ray tracing today okay so the question
was we have Andrew here now assuming
that you could rate race render a game
and though performance hit what are the
benefits of doing so relative to
traditional rendering and videos tried
to explain this pretty hard I think with
with the Star Wars demo so you've seen
the Star Wars demo that talks about a
lot of it but I don't know where do we
start with this yeah I don't know
because it is mostly not having to use
screen space reflections even though
that is possible it is the cheapest way
to render reflections and actually not
sure the limits of our txg enough is
this something we could test to see if
non screen space reflections are cheaper
than r-tx reflections or ray-traced
reflections you know in final games yeah
I don't know the problem is the demos
we're kind of incomplete and that they'd
show r-tx on and then everything off
right like including that
existing cheated ways to do lighting so
and when we say things like so and reuse
a few words they're cheaper is in
reference to resource consumption and
screen space reflections we should
define as well as that like so that what
we're talking about the camera has a
view of us camera can't see our backs if
we have a mirror behind us right it's
it's super weird if there's a mirror
behind us and reusing screens based
reflections you'd actually see our face
is looking at you in the mirror behind
us if that's all that the camera could
go based off of right and there are ways
to cheat that too I think
right I guess ray tracing is probably
the the easiest way to get accuracy but
it's extremely resource intensive right
if you're using it I don't know how far
we should talk into ray tracing but you
would be tracing all of the all of the
color bouncing off of all of our
materials from every light source so
that way it can get all we what's the
best way to put this just like all the
color bouncing off of us from every
direction would be hitting everything
around us
yes sir tense like if I guess some
example would be the other day there was
a coca-cola truck parked outside of our
window that's a giant red truck and so
the light is hitting that truck and as
it reflected off into the window of the
office it was coloring the light on the
walls in the office itself a bit red
right so basically like we had red
lights in the room but it was just a
natural sunlight hitting a red object
then turning that light red as it comes
in through the window so is that is that
that be global illumination level
illumination and that's another thing
that anybody has been demoing with our
TX so our TX more than just our TX
itself is more than just the prefix for
the card it's a package like an SDK of
all the stuff but at global illumination
is one of the things where you can get
that indirect I guess lighting is that
that's correct
so you get indirect lighting off another
surface bounce coming to the room and I
don't know I mean can you fake that
stuff now well yeah it's the other thing
that unreal
has be able to do that for a very long
time at least since the release of
underline religion for they have tech
time I was showing it to ya right so
it's it's not like it's new visually
it's just new the way well not even new
but it's it's new that Nvidia is able to
do this would be a ray tracing a vial
maintaining real-time performance right
that's the new part it's ray tracing
isn't new and these lighting effects
aren't new correct but the real time
aspect is so the real time aspect is are
you real arguably right not that new
either right the way that they're
combining it all together into one thing
is pretty new so yeah then I guess part
of the question we should address is
just what's the benefit and I think if a
lot of games right now are pretty good
at cheating the graphics right and by
cheating it's not like it's a bad thing
it's just you find the way to make the
graphics without killing the performance
they're so good at cheating it in that
for a while anyway I don't know that
you'd really might not look all that
different to you yeah so it depends on
the implementation which if you're doing
true direct lighting you will not have
any like if my hand was close to the
table we'd not it the backside would be
completely dark there would be no light
bouncing off the table to my to the
other side of my hand but you can just
say it's pretty close to something just
make it a little lighter right and
you're not actually count counting up
light bounces at that point you're just
telling it to make it lighter because
it's closer to something which would be
an example of cheating so you're doing
like a product somebody track and then
just applying a different color to it or
hue or something yeah something like
that but not tracing the Rays right so
and ray tracing to by the way is traced
backwards so comes from your eye back to
the source not in real life
not in real life but in no way this
technology works it is because it's
easier to see what hits the camera and
then go backwards from there rather than
let's trace literally everything right
and then have a bunch of things go off
into the distance word it's not even
being picked up by the camera right yes
so I don't hopefully that helps that
anything else you want to clarify on
this
I guess the if if you're implying that
graphics don't mean much to you and what
does ray-tracing bring otherwise if it's
not just a graphical improvement it
honestly doesn't really bring anything
to be honest yeah it's a graphics thing
and if you're happy with existing
graphics and you want better gameplay
it's not really gonna it's not like
ray-tracing is gonna enable new
mechanics right in any meaningful way
anyway it's not gonna change any
geometry like you said in any way either
right geometry is it's not changed at
all
whatever models they made or what they
made so hopefully that helps a last
question and while I have you here
Andrew is how much of your life when
your life flashes before your eyes how
much of your life do you want to not
have been retraced I think all of it
will have been ray traced yeah all of
its rays last question so last one was
from Jacque McBeal he says hey Steve a
suggestion how about four to five
dollars off if you buy a set of 4gn beer
glasses I won up to you and we did $20
off if you buy four but they're out of
stock because because I made them $20
off before so anyway they'll be
restocked student and store doc gamers
Nexus not net to pick up those or
anything else like the mod match thank
you Andrew for joining me and you'll
find more of our stuff on the channel so
subscribe for that as always
