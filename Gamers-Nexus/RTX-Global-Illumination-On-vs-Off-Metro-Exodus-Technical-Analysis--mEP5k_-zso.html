Metro Exodus r-tx implementation this
was one of the initial titles announced
for RTX when nvidia pushed the cards
last year end of last year so Metro
Exodus has the global illumination
implementation and this is the first
time we've seen this in a real game for
RTX the trick is to look at well is it
actually better than what you can
typically do with global illumination
through the faked means and is it worth
any potential performance hits so today
I'm joined by Andrew Coleman he's a 3d
artist who works for us on the video
team and we're gonna be looking at the
actual the quality so there's a
qualitative analysis of what r-tx is
doing in Metro Exodus if it's any good
and then we'll have a separate video on
the benchmark performance to look at how
the different cards compare versus each
other so you'll want to subscribe for
that but let's get into the qualitative
look at Metro Exodus and the r-tx global
illumination implementation before that
this video is brought to you by the EVGA
CLC 280 liquid cooler people ask me how
I keep cool during the summer with all
this hair well I've tried a lot of
different products and a few do exactly
what I need many of them caused tangles
or worse EVGA CLC 280 helps keep my core
temperatures lower they're in hot
benchmarking sessions the CLC 280 is
price competitive and focuses on
performance for value offering a 280
liquid cooler at an affordable price get
yours at the link in the description
below hair mounting kit sold separately
this first scene we have so it's on the
train it's in the hub level there are
few different levels in Metro Exodus
where there's the hub which is kind of
the overworld non-combat area there's
underground stuff where actually in some
of the underground we saw r-tx really
doesn't do a whole lot and then and a
lot of the cinematics which is the other
part of the game RTX can often impact
things heavily so it's really hit and
miss as for whether r-tx is noticeable
teeth to anyone but we'll talk about
that as we go through this and then
there's also the benchmark the benchmark
we have a separate performance review
coming up that you should check out but
we talked about how the benchmark is
unrealistically heavy so it is not a
fair representation of how the game
actually performs in game and actual
gameplay but that's a separate topic so
this
first scene is in the overworld on top
of the Train and the two side the two
demos we've got r-tx on where it is a
bit I suppose brighter where there's
more definition to the character
especially the color of the character's
clothes things like that and then it off
is going to be where he's silhouetted so
Andrew what are we looking at here so
when our TX is off the game is only
calculating direct lighting so you can
see that since no light rays from the
Sun is able to hit him since they're
being occluded by the Train he's just
completely black and silhouetted but
with our TX on the light rays are able
to bounce off of the snow and that
lightens up that half of his face and
body but you can also see that the other
half of his face that's closer to the
Train is also darker because it's kind
of like an effect of ambient occlusion
how objects closer to other unlit
surfaces become darker right just
because they eat the energy of light
from each other the trees have some
effect as well you can see that they're
being lit from underneath from the snow
also as opposed to just on top and
having the dark shadows underneath the
rice yeah this is all because we're
casting the the Sun is the single source
of light I guess so so it would behave
how you would assume a Sun single source
of light above everything would behave
this next scene before we get into some
of the ones where it's just sort of
disappointing I guess the difference
that we saw her our initial impression
of this game was disappointing
implementation but as we played through
it more some of the cutscenes were
actually pretty big impact so in this
one what we're looking at is a scene
inside of the train car we've got the
the female character in front of us in
the ground there's a duct that goes down
to where they shovel the coal into the
engine so that's a very bright area and
has some interesting properties and as
we switch between these I guess RTX on
in this instance is actually going to be
the darker of the two right where it
looks like there's a lot more contrast
or at least darker blacks I guess is
really what we're looking at Petric was
saying like the other day like the are
ticks off to someone who plays games
looks more natural just because that's
how it games usually look and you're
able to see more of the environment and
also from a gameplay standpoint you want
to be able to see typically more of the
environment right well I should go in
super immersion so that's kind of a
preference question to what are the the
main change is that in between these two
scenes obviously it's everyone can see
in the video it's darker but we have
some differences outside the window too
normally these effects target a specific
thing like normally like in video game
work kind of hair works or whatever
towards yeah would affect like a certain
area or certain like a small section of
something but you can see that it's just
just affecting everything in the level
all the time yeah it's just really
interesting it's also a bit of an
explanation of why we have the
performance impact we do because it's
everything so the highlights will stay
that like as you can see here but like
on other parts where it's very bright
they stayed basically the same
brightness between the two even though
the shadows get much darker right so
that highlight on the object near the
character's chest in the side of the
screen oh that's a gun or something
remains about the same between both yeah
so another note for this scene line is
because of the things there's some
dynamic elements to like breathe in for
my character the lights kind of changed
that makes it a bit hard to compare but
that seems pretty interesting because I
had a lot of differences so this scene
has a lot of small changes he pointed
most of these out but probably one of
the bigger ones I'm seeing right away is
on the left side there's I don't know
what that is gold object of some kind
yeah it's a gold thing okay that's very
technical thank you so there's a golden
thing effect ever seen some differences
here
what is this is this RTX on on or is it
off it's off off so this that's off okay
so then on where does all that lighting
detail you know it's interesting with
it on and that's high an ultra-right
also on I I mean I guess maybe there's
no source of light back towards the
character to create that reflection
we're seeing on the surface yeah so that
goes away and we end up with a much
flatter surface which to me honestly
looks worse but again is probably less
accurate this is the one that I showed
this at Patrick and he was talking about
how as a gamer you would prefer having
it off here because it just seems like
what a game should look like right
you're playing it yeah because we've
been playing games like this forever
yeah and then with our TX turned on I
like it's hard for me to even judge
right I think it's more physically
accurate all the windows have a whole
lot more they're much harder to see out
of yeah there's a lot more bloom all the
windows yeah but there are little things
like and the crevices up in the corner
they receive more shadow and right with
our TX off it's kind of like oh yeah
why is this part of this light so bright
why is the top of the solid light
fixture right bright yeah when the
lights are under the fixture and then
you have some examples here where light
coming in from this window is able to
brighten up the ceiling closest to it
right like that yeah that does make a
lot more sense when you start pointing
out those really small details
yeah for sure this next clip answers the
question of what's the difference
between our TX off our TX ultra and our
TX high because this is the only and
video wouldn't want to dirty their brand
with an RT XL oh so there's only high an
ultra so what is the difference then
what are we looking at right now
so this is our TX off and yes I guess
pretty apparent the difference between
that and your base reference so the next
one you can see that there's a side of
the building gets a little more
illumination in the back right in some
hundred under the tank as well got some
more illumination from from that bounce
lading office now and this could be done
with voxel
to vxa oh but it never really got any
widespread but here we're doing this
with a global illumination what about
the next scene is this r-tx ultra ultra
ok so you can see that difference is
very minimal some some dark things get
slightly darker darker some bright
things get slightly brighter right and
there's gonna be a lot of mouse clicks
picking up on the mic potentially right
now because I'm trying to figure out
what the differences are
haha so like this building right here it
gets slightly brighter with ultra ok so
building in the backgrounds a bit
brighter the performance hit here is a
couple percent by the way we have some
numbers on this as well that we can
share in the future video but the
performance impact is it's anywhere from
a single digit percentages like 10% kind
of depending on the scene actually would
I take that back this side of the
building it's slightly darker darker
with ultra so the side of the building
slightly darker with ultra so the
question is from a technology or a
realism standpoint does go in from high
to ultra impress you at all I mean is it
can you appreciate what's being done
here or what is you know what's what's
really the value just more I think
there's definitely a diminishing return
from either altra alright so it's like I
assume that what they're doing is just
increasing the amount of times that the
light is able to bounce off of a surface
before it is terminated so it's is it
sort of like each ray has a number of I
guess bounces
yeah the clean the engine that it's
allowed before and then once it it hits
that number of bounces it just stops
right because if you have a hundred
thousand Ray's bouncing for an infinite
amount of times you have reality yeah
right which is difficult to render so
okay so yeah I guess not a huge
difference between a high and ultra
definitely an appreciable difference
between off and and any of them I think
that difference is noticeable now is it
worth it
I guess we'll leave that up to you but
it's noticeable okay so this one they've
got some flashlights they're looking
down
to the great and with off I guess our
baseline versus high what are the main
differences and then claim to say there
are none but one of the differences is
in the top left it is slightly darker
underneath the great section yeah you
might have to zoom in pretty hard and
post for them to even appreciate that
yeah there's not much of a difference
you know top left a slice lightly change
brightness not super useful all of the
differences here are very small and from
ultra die I think are also very small so
we could probably move on from this one
and in this one so we have again your
notes here say this is slightly darker
which is not particularly compelling
that specific section it's okay so that
so let's take a some post let's just do
them really hard on that specific
section it's slightly darker there's a
new lighting on the chain link to you
say as well yes so that's interesting I
don't really know that is pretty
interesting that's the first time we've
I think we've seen that on an object
like I guess those are made out of
geometry then normally those kind of
assets would be alpha textures right
since they're so dense yeah you weren't
wouldn't really want to burn geometry on
on all those chain links I guess yeah
but I guess also if they're using an
alpha texture and a normal map mm maybe
that would be enough for them to pick up
lighting in that way but it is very
subtle right so potentially some tricks
could be played there but again pretty
limited differences between and just as
a note as we're playing this footage
back you're gonna see some changes that
aren't a result of the settings or the
graphics changes it's just a result of
like pulsing lights and changing light
sources in the game it's alright it's
very dynamic game this next scene so now
we're flipping back so we're gonna we we
gave you the the downside of r-tx
starting to show you the upside there's
a bigger impact here than the previous
see and it's actually quite apparent
what would you point out as the the most
prevalent change
and this instance could be the lighting
on the character for sure so this is
again next to the Train
some of the same stuff applies as
previously we've got presumably light
bounces off of the snow I guess right
and there's a single light source above
I don't know is this what about that
train in the background the lighting
changes in the background there like on
the ridge as well yeah there's a lot of
lighting changes all across scene even
like things that are way off in the back
that are Glary that you can hardly see
the lighting so changes on them sorry
yeah yeah when I first all I said I kind
of just thought that the game had some
kind of dynamic time-of-day system or
whatever in that that was what's
happening between he's like capturing
artifact right but as you can see in the
shadows the light source remains the
same and is in the same position so you
have a shadow on the train wall right
isn't exactly it's like from the
character right you can see shadows cast
on the character by equipment that's
worn by the character like this sort of
whatever that thing is in the middle of
her suit oh yeah I didn't notice that is
casting shadows onto the I guess the
best so that's pretty cool well the
interesting thing is that normally
global illumination has a tendency to
kind of wash out shadow contrast because
it'll fill it in with additional
lighting from the rest of the scene but
here it looks like it's actually
increasing shadow contrast there in
making new shadows in places that didn't
exist before either yes it does the game
and see the light being cast like
bounced off of the other objects and
services does it see that as does your
light source it would see that yes yet
see that as a new place to cast a shadow
from right understand so next one is the
Train side by side what is this scene
what are we looking at here so for this
one you can see a lot more I guess it's
a reiteration of what we said earlier of
the light bouncing off of the snow which
will be hitting the shadow on the train
which illuminates it much more
than if it was just direct lighting
right yes so we've got a much darker
scene and I'm that as r-tx off yes with
it a bit lighter more limited you can
see what's going on that's our TX on so
trains got more bounce like motion blur
again increasing with our TX the
background light changes significantly
you can kind of look at some of the
trees in the background and the
buildings in the background this next
one this is one of the first scenes in
the game and we were both looking at it
at this point when you were playing and
I think I believe you were almost exact
words were I'm just disappointed I think
it was worse than disappointed I might
let it work yeah this the the first part
of the game is not a good example of how
our txg I will play it through the rest
of the game for sure right so in this
tunnel there's like no difference almost
it just gets darker
it just is Carter to see what's going on
right which is not I like even from a
even if it's a little more accurate and
it might be I don't know I guess let's
get somewhat subjective but even if it's
a little more accurate at some point
it's just making the experience worse
yeah and making a pitch-black tunnel
even pitch or black this is not having
your framelit framerate at the same time
yes cutting it in half is not beneficial
so we don't need to talk about this much
there's no real difference this was one
of the earliest scenes and I would
imagine some other scenes that are
similar to this you might see the same
but not all of the tunnel scenes are bad
though we have some other examples you
might come by later so this next one
this comes from the benchmark and this
so there's a pretty noticeable impact
again and just sort of the general
brightness or exposure I guess
yeah the scene where I mean the way
we're playing it back here for me the
scene on without remembering exactly
which one is which the scene on the
right is what I would hands down prefer
that's because I can actually like see
what's happening I can see the color on
the rat
for example but I don't think that's the
right choice because I think the one on
the left is r-tx
yes so what's going on in this scene so
this one's really weird because we've
been talking about how bounce lighting
from the ground will make things much
brighter than they would be with r-tx
off right but and there is still bounce
lighting from the ground here yes it's
still happening but like as you can see
that the rabbit is almost completely
silhouetted against the sky correctly
right going into the building and the
benchmark scene this area has got a lot
of fires this is actually one of the
heaviest impactors we'll talk about this
in the performance review but a lot of
fire in here
is there any meaningful global
illumination chantrey that you can point
out yeah so once we get inside there
really is not any difference via the
bounced lighting inside of the house
does not seem to be affected very much
by the light coming in through the
windows so we're back outside now we're
getting close to an interesting bug with
r-tx that we found and that's how the
doc so the doc what happens is as you
kind of go past this pole on the ground
the that there's a time of day change
and with r-tx on I believe it is with
r-tx on there's clearly a sliver of
daytime to the right of the pole even
though the rest of the scene is night
and this is not I would venture to say
this is not realistic so we're not I
don't think we really have any idea of
why this is happening specifically I
really don't know unless they they're
doing some like a scripted sequence
involving that pole specifically because
it does kind of it takes up the whole
camera so maybe they thought they could
do it need effect there or whatever and
you can see past the pole actually if he
from the sort of the the sheer side
angle you can see that it's still
daytime yeah in front of it to the left
too so it does look like the poles being
a divider today there's just a weird bug
we found so next one here we have a demo
of as I guess there's a light source in
the back from the fire
and I don't know that we have many light
sources that looks like there might be
one right behind us unknown light source
you've marked yeah so I marked that
there because it is interesting how that
like if you look at if you're just
playing this as a game I guess which it
is nice it goes with like a normal
virtual world mind set our TX off looks
fine but then we turn our tix on it's
like oh yeah there is not a light by
that door so why is it so bright
anything going on so I guess it gets
down to like subjectiveness of yeah some
subjectivity of do you actually I mean
for me I've always this is a break into
the subject of our unit per second I am
a a competitive player so I only care
about RTS and fps and FPS has frame rate
as well so if a setting makes it harder
for me to see the guy I'm trying to kill
then I don't like that setting if you're
an immersion player I think there's
maybe an argument for this though it's
the last couple examples here in this
one we're looking at a scene down a
stairwell I guess in the Train there's
actually a pretty big difference here on
that door so with our TX off I guess the
door is lit in a way which is
unrealistic yeah
it seems like it's hard to describe but
yeah it does seem like it's getting
light from a place it doesn't exist it
looks like there's a light dead center
in front of the door yeah it is like
defused yeah and the only light source
down there than the one we can see above
it is there is a light source about 10
feet where we're standing except
underneath us from the fire but that
would not have that effect on the door
right and it would be probably colored
light too so another interesting thing
about this is how there's a lot of light
in this little crevice with our TX off
that kind of it almost implies that
there's a window in the wall up there
and then we turn our TX on it just turns
clearly black black like it makes more
sense that that's just a little hole in
the wall right yes there is is there
Oh up there I don't think so yeah so
this next scene we're looking now at the
worker shoveling the coal into the Train
what is what is interesting about this
one so this goes back kind of like what
we're saying about the door word the
light source seems like it is receiving
lighting from someplace that doesn't
exist and that's the same thing for that
pipe on the side right where it kind of
it's like it's almost acting like an
emissive object but that takes off yeah
it's like radiating light yes and then
with Arctic sonic it it I guess I like
places it and that's to the scene better
that's kind of what I've noticed with
r-tx on for all of these I suppose
objects feel more in place with were
they are on the scene in terms of like
the shadow gradient yeah yeah
to some extent so this guy stand outside
it's a lot of the same stuff as for
getting more snow bounce the front end
of the Train you noted here is a little
more uniformly yeah with r-tx on right
and another thing that is happening in
this scene that I don't think we've
talked about yet and any other scenes is
that the GI is making all the shadows
much brighter right so they are
receiving additional light from other
directions other than the Sun yeah and
you can actually see good examples on
his chest or midsection where he's got
all that gear with our TX off it's
completely blacked out or almost
completely blacked out yeah with the
shadow I will note I the shadow of the
player in the scene kind of unrelated as
terrible let me see that it's creepy I
need to capture more footage of that
they put that in here like it's a
player's shadow has absolutely no life
it just translates across the surface
his legs move barely but hey like like
as if they're I don't know sluggish but
yeah his uh his shoulders and arms are
taped to the side of his body as arms
are also the width of sticks if you look
at the shadow cast on the snow in the
background yeah
I know because I've been trying
seen a hundred times so yeah and this
one I'm actually is this this is our TX
off right here and that's on yes
I to be fully honest prefer our TX off I
think the Train looks better I do think
the and also the characters clothing I
think that the I think that the detail
in the front of the Train is increased
with our TX off just because it's a I
said this earlier how global
illumination tends to wash out some
lighting details since it decreases some
contrast in the shadows but I do think
that with our tix on in this scene even
though it's not actually happening it
gives his skin the feel of subsurface
scattering because of how uh how much
softer the shadows are on on his face
right so last scene we have is again the
front of the Train except the face in a
different direction do you want to
explain what's going on here it looks
almost looks like we have a light source
coming from the front like not that's
not just the Sun but yeah I guess it is
just the Sun that's bouncing yeah this
one I showed this at Patrick and he
thought the trees looked almost broken
without the Exxon because they don't
receive any shadow underneath them
anymore but they also seem broken or
Authority X off because they don't seem
lit at all all right either with our
Terrace off they definitely look broken
they look like the kind of trees you're
not supposed to see when you're out of
bounds yeah like low-poly
no detail but the interesting thing that
I thought for this one was that the guy
on the right the bounce lighting from
the snow is so extreme that it changes
the color bleed changes the perceived
color of his outfit yes it goes from
like a silver medal to almost like a
brown the his face changes quite a bit
too yeah so I think that's because he's
receiving more shadow from the helmet so
it's occluding a lot more light that
makes sense
interesting but the guy in the far left
both r-tx off this the shadows stopped
like halfway down his midsection
that's not right the shadow stopped
halfway through his midsection right now
Authority X on it almost carried it all
the way through to his shoulder though
lighting does so it's like the LSS is in
this game it is sort of defective in the
pre-launch build so we don't have
anything on it today but we'll look at
that separately it does the same thing
as previously it's sort of super samples
it's it's a bit better than video we
Matt if I call it super sampling but the
isn't super sampling in the name well if
you only cook if you drop the DL he'll
be mad it's not super sampling it's deep
learned super sampling but it's super
sampling so I mean with that you get
some FPS back you drop the real
resolution you fake increase the
resolution and then the result is that
it looks blurry err with a higher fake
resolution so that's a separate topic
but this will be your walkthrough of GI
global illumination via RT X in Metro
Exodus and as always you can check out
