the HyperX suite so we'll be looking at
the RGB memory modules which are
probably the most interesting just
because they actually synchronize with
the board I'm like everything else where
it's a fixed color so I'll be talking
about those some new peripherals things
like that before getting to that this
coverage is brought to you by a thermal
take and their Corp III enclosure which
is wall mountable and works as a test
bench so for the memory that we have
it's the first thing to talk about this
is a predator kit of RAM it's looking at
something like second half of 2017 so
it's a bit out we don't have a price yet
or anything like that
what we do have is a functional demo and
you may have seen our D 270 board
reviews for gigabyte where they had the
RS RGB lighting effects and the software
the RGB fusion software that's at work
and some of the boards here this is an
rog board so it works with Asus MSI and
gigabyte as of now and what happens is
basically the memory synchronizes at
least somewhat in this demo to the
motherboard so there's some latency here
it's all prototype right now that'll
probably be resolved later and in terms
of software support you just go through
the software as normally for the
motherboard and tune the color of the
LED or if you want as it's going on here
a color cycle other than the RAM there's
of course other RGB peripherals as
everyone has right now and we've got the
FPS alloy equivalent here or the follow
up rather this was the RGB version of
the keyboard if you saw the FPS alloy in
our packs coverage that was a $100
keyboard at the time had a single switch
so as a Cherry MX which in blues now
there are blues Browns and reds the RGB
keyboard here also is blues Browns and
reds using the Cherry MX RGB switches
and I don't have a price on this yet so
also TBD but you know it's an RGB
keyboard I'll have more coverage if if
there's anything more to say about that
price don't know switches are all known
and trusted so if you like the switches
then you'll probably like the switches
on the keyboard those don't really
change much in terms of features on the
board it's a pretty clean layout so it's
not going for the gamer garish aesthetic
and kind of reminds me where of course
they're in terms of simplistic metal
based designs and then finally or well
second to finally
we've got the pulsefire Mouse so this is
hyper axes first Mouse endeavor this
uses a picsArt 3310 sensor I don't have
too much in the way of specs yet I do
have a price on this one it's a $50
Mouse and it's pretty simple it's got
two buttons on the left side so two
thumb buttons and a middle button up
here for a dpi which I just gave the
camera the middle finger I guess oops
then the LED in the scroll wheel which
actually is kind of interesting because
if you're using an optical scroll wheel
it can cause some interference but a lot
of the manufacturers who do that end up
using a mix of optical and mechanical
and then for the headset there's the new
cloud revolver s so if you saw the
revolver in our CES 2016 coverage I
believe this is a follow-up to that this
one's got a large condenser mic on it
and does not fold but it's pretty
flexible so you can bend it to your face
and then the only thing really worth
note immediately anyway is the Dolby
Surround inline dongles so this is a 7.1
Doby setup it's no software required
there's a hardware switch push the
button and it turns on or off pretty
straightforward and we've talked about
this technology before with previous
headset reviews it does tend to vary a
little bit in terms of quality with
implementation per headset and game so
we'll have to test it more in a review
or something to actually talk about the
quality but in terms of game sport it
just depends on what you're playing so
that's the main thing it is detachable
the dongle so you could plug in or you
catch it and I think that's pretty much
all there is to talk about for this 50
millimeter drivers we'll have some
photos and additional spec sheets in the
article linked in the description below
as always patreon link the post show
video helps out directly thanks for
watching I'll see you all next time
