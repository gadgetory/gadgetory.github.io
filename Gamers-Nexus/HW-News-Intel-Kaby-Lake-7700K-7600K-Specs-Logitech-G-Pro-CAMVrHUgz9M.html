this week this one focuses on some
products so we're looking at intel's the
new kb lake cpu skews that have been
somewhat detailed looking at logitech's
new mouse and a somewhat unique but
interesting case the other news video
we'll talk about technology specifically
GDD are six hbm three things like that
that will come out around the same time
so before we get into the coverage for
this video it is brought to you by i buy
power and the new elements gaming PC
with a full tempered glass side window
and LEDs all over the place so the main
part of the content is in towson new kb
lake CPU skews we've known that these
are coming for quite a while now they've
been delayed but it does still look like
a quarter 4 2016 launch for kb lake and
they will remain on LGA 1151 as well for
the socket type OC aholic details the
skis for kb lake from an i5 7500 up to
an i7 7700 k and hidden markets probably
in the fourth quarter the i7 7700 k is
the high-end unmarked chip with a
reported for you can see of four points
you get hurts base that boosts up to 4.5
compared to the sky lake i 760 700k also
on 14 nanometer process this place is
the base clock of the new chip equals
the 6700 k is at boost clock with a zero
point three gigahertz and gain in the
boost department overall Intel is
pushing eight megabytes of cash on the
7700 k and is using a quad-core cpu with
smt for a total of eight threads nothing
really unexpected here we don't yet know
the HD graphics version for intel's new
kb lake cpus and that will be detailed
closer to launch the 7600 k will fill
the enthusiast market with a 3.8
gigahertz clock base that boots 24 and a
quad-core cpu without smt and 6
megabytes of smart cache TDP for the
1151 enthusiast class cpus is rated at
95 wats a marginal gain over sky like
generations at 91 watt TDP for the case
qs chips lower power chips are rated for
65 watts including the non k 7770 600
cpus while lower power chips land at 35
watts and are branded with into
t suffix anytime you see a tee on an
intel cpu by the way that's what it
means ultra low power and these cpus run
lower clock rates that aren't
overclockable but generate less heat and
our targeted at mainstream and low power
htpc type setups of course this does
correlate to power draw but when we read
these TDP metrics it's not actually a
literal 35 watts or a literal 95 wats
necessarily that's more measurement of
the cooling solution required for the
chip and the technology LGA 1151 if you
hadn't already noticed that's remaining
in use for kb lake and it will now be
differentiated by the chip it's targeted
at standard power low-power ultra-low
power so when buying motherboards 4k be
like in the future you'll want to look
at the compatibility list for the board
to make sure that cpu is supported
because the power delivery will sort of
dictate what CP is work on what board
other news this week includes a
Logitech's new g pro mouse this is a
seventy dollar mouse targeted at the
more mainstream market they're trying to
pair the g 100 ng 303 to make a body and
combination of functionality that is not
offensive to the mainstream market IE
not a gamer mouse like we've seen with
the 303 which using Logitech's words was
a very polarizing design the g pro uses
the same metal tension spring buttons
and side buttons as the G 303 a mouse
that we actually did like but it ditch
is the controversial gamer look of the
303 instead taking design elements from
the g one hundred mouse that was more of
a professional consumer type mouse in
this regard the g pro is a merger of the
g one hundred and g 303 the g pro is
still using the PMW 3366 sensor sticks
with built-in memory for profile
transport without demanding software
everywhere you go and uses a scroll
wheel that doesn't rely on optics for
tracking and that's one of the more
interesting elements that will be
looking at in a teardown the logitech g
pro is targeted at a more mainstream and
professional audience with a gaming
slant and hopes to fill that less than
gamer look for mice that we've seen for
the company's existing line up as an
aside logitech has finally ditched the
Greek god naming scheme which really
truly was awful as we said and I think
the Artemis spectrum review there's no
Ryan spark as well
well there are a couple of other ones
Daedalus was another that was a mouse
there's no real rhyme or reason to it
that is gone and I guess the only thing
I'm really disappointed in is that there
was no Dionysus cup or something like
that for gaming and MLG events as a
final news item there's a new gaming
case from the netherlands-based company
x2 and it's called the Empire this is a
case that uses internally only 0.5 five
millimeter thick steel not that thick
compared to some other stuff we've
looked at like the in 1303 but it's got
an aluminum brushed finish on the
outside that does help strengthen things
most obviously is the unique design
slanted somewhat trapezoidal and the
enclosure uses a glass side window with
the same unique shape 250 angular design
showcasing and s 3 40 inspired PSU
shroud and pre-installed RGB LED rear
fan 7 expansion slots make for full ATX
support for the most part and couple
with GPUs up to 400 millimeters in
length granted we're not really sure if
that's the length measured at the top or
the bottom of the slot give them the
trapezoidal shape again but either way
it's plenty of space standard audio and
USB in the front too I oh area is
available with support for legacy ac97
audio for some reason that Peyer case is
an interesting one it's weird I kinda
it's reminiscent of some of the inland
stuff we've seen that doesn't
necessarily target the wider market but
hopefully we'll be able to look at it
because it is kind of strange and I'd
like to see how it performs thermally
does look interesting though so that's
the main news items for the products
this week we do have this mouse quite
obviously and we'll probably review it
we've got packs coming up so that may
take priority but that's coming up soon
do a teardown probably and the case the
Empire will reach out to them see what
you can do otherwise Kaiba lake is a
ways out still so check back for more
content as always patreon link in the
post role video subscribe for more I'll
see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
