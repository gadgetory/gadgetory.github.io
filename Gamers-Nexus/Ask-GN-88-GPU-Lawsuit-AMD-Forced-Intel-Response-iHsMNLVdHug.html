as always leave your questions in the
comment section below for next week's
episodes we're shooting three today one
is going to be on the patreon available
side of things so you go to
patreon.com/scishow his exit stubs out
and get access to that extra episode
bonus episode the other two will be here
on the main channel
we ran probably some pretty close to
each other within 18 hours or so and we
have several good ones for this GG 10:30
follow-up questions mostly legal ones
and a questions about not all gigahertz
being created equal things like that
also a really fun flow question for fans
before that this video is brought to you
by thermal takes view 37 case the view
37 focuses on highlighting custom PC
builds with its full panoramic window
and tinted front acrylic and our thermal
testing the view 37 performed reasonably
well when considering its looks focused
build which is partly thanks to the
airflow design and the removal of a
bottom power supply shroud for a balance
of looks and performance check the link
in the description below for the view 37
before we get any the first question as
I noted in the other episode that's
going live this shirt we've hauled
through all of them already so we're be
closing pre-orders in about a week when
we run out of our inventory that we've
ordered if you want one get your order
in now on store documents access dotnet
it's a limited edition shirt foil print
shirt of our 10 year anniversary GN tear
down logo design once they're gone
they're gone we're not gonna make this
shirt again ever
so the pre-orders closed in about a week
if you want to get it get it now first
question is from dr. guns for hands who
has one of my favorite names I think
this was on the patreon discord dr.
gunsther hands says just watched the GT
10:30 video and I have a question that
I'd actually liked to direct at the
lawyer guy you had on about the Nvidia
NDA if he's willing to would having
these two different products is
referring to the GT 10:30 with gddr5 and
the 10:30 with ddr4 we're having these
two different products that perform
wildly different to the tune of two acts
in some cases with the same branding and
hiding the differences in the product
number constitute a misrepresentation of
the product by FCC think probably you
mean FTC guidelines NBA deceptive
practice that they could end up on the
hook for so
first thing yeah FTC at FCC get confused
all the time it's FTC that would handle
something like that and the answer I
think very briefly is no I don't think
there is going to be a legal problem
there so obviously we as a media outlet
take issue with the GT 1030 ddr4 and
gddr5 cards the fact that they exist
with the same name and have such hugely
different performance is something we
didn't like and we said that in the
video and made it all very clear and all
that stuff the gt-r five versions
actually a decent pretty good performer
for the price but the ddr4 one is awful
and it actually wouldn't be such a big
deal if it didn't have the same name as
I said before because I mean then it'd
just be just be a low-performing card
for display out but having the same name
is what makes it misleading as you said
and I absolutely agree it is it is
definitely misleading now I am obviously
not a lawyer I have spoken with two but
but I had a pretty good feeling I could
answer this question even without
talking to them I did get some some
legal oversight though just to answer
your question as best I can so my
feeling and and the one that the lawyers
we spoke with basically confirmed was
that although it is kind of a just a not
great business practice and potentially
misleads consumers to buying their own
card although those points stand I don't
think this is necessarily a legal
problem and here's why ultimately it
what is the what is the phrase caveat
emptor it's all buyer beware everything
is on the spec page so it says ddr4 it
says ddr4 somewhere in the name even if
it's kind of like a weird serial number
basically that a consumer might not
understand but it's there
and it's in the spec sheet so really
they've done I think the legal
requirement to disclose what the thing
is and you look at other companies do
this all the time like SSD companies
they change components yearly for the
same SSD so you might buy it same for a
actually some memory there's a reason a
lot of these companies motherboards to
VRMs well sometimes we'll ask this is
more true for low on components
high-end so a lot of time with low and
budget components we'll ask like what
PRM are using what nand are you using or
what memory dyes are using and they will
often the companies will say something
to us to the effect of like well we
can't answer that and of course my
response for years was always but I can
open it and find out so why don't you
just save us all the time tell me and
the reason I finally got an answer from
someone on that because I would open
them and I would find out and so and
finally told me actually it's because
because it's such a budget component we
might change suppliers on that stuff and
as long as it performs within probably
their rough guidelines they're fine with
changing suppliers but they don't like
to make a hard claim on what's in there
because it might change so that's kind
of a different issue but that kind of
stuff happens all the time though and
you don't see lawsuits over those
normally but anyway then that's because
they they define aspects like maybe IOPS
or maybe memory frequency and timings
and as long as they meet the frequency
and tie means then they've done what
they need to do to meet that because
they weren't promising a certain type of
memory die or in probably in Sam's on P
die or whatever but anyway this is
clearly different because this is an
instance where there are two products
not one and they have pretty close names
but yeah answer it again I am NOT a
legal expert I have spoken with some and
but I yeah I think this is really a
non-issue in a legal sense in a moral
sense I think it's a problem and I don't
like it but I don't think we're gonna
see on video dragged through a lawsuit
over the GT 1030 it could be wrong you
can sue anyone don't have to be right or
win or anything but I don't I don't
expect it it's a little bit it's
different from like the gtx970 practices
because this is a it's disclosed it's
just up to you to figure that out
which again although shitty I guess is
not a legal hook so next question is for
and and thanks to our lawyer friends who
helped out with that next question Louis
Beck actions quash that
hey I've got a question for Sen can you
perhaps give some insight to the old
adage not all gigahertz are created
equal
I deal in older hardware a lot and can
can 100% confirm that sometimes a slower
processor will outperform a higher clock
counterpart I know that some of this
comes down to cache size yes but how
does the actual IPC compare between
generations and if possible between
products lines are there any instances
of modern processors where the older
generation or a specific older part
compared to its specific newer
counterpart would be a genuinely better
choice great question a good example of
this is how the later generation 1
gigahertz Pentium 3 processors would
outperform the early 1.3 gigahertz
Pentium 4 CPUs just by p4 having higher
clock speeds yes so that's certainly one
of them
the next one I would point to is
probably feed on to feed on to was a
crazy good processor phenom ii x4 and
it's unfortunate that i had to deal with
Nehalem or sandy or whatever came out
right around as we talked about in our
phenom to revisit that we did it's
unfortunate because Intel kind of came
out of nowhere almost with massive
improvements the Sandy Bridge and the
Heylin was pretty good but phenom ii x4
was it great or was it x6 i think it was
hack 6 wasn't it sorry my memory it's a
long time ago I think it might have been
x6 either way the point is phenom 2 X
whatever phenom 2 was really good and it
was better than bulldozers or in a lot
of instances
I think IPC was better on phenom 2 and
I'm I'm pretty sure it was versus the
original bulldozer launched bulldozer
was pretty messy when it first came out
and later on in life for that instance
but a literal bulldozer I don't just
mean like the name people use as kind of
the overarching name for FX I mean like
literal the first bulldozer processor
was bad and phenom 2 it was better than
it in a lot of instances so I would say
that's a great example of what you're
talking about other ones I'm sure there
are other examples that's kind of the
one that sticks in my mind I'll think
about it and let you know if I come up
with another one but that's probably
that's the best one I have yours pretty
good too
other than that so some specific
examples you're talking about I guess
these are counterparts but not from the
same company this is a
Dressen you're not all gigahertz are
created equal the best example of this
is different architectures so same
architecture like risin risin two or
whatever they will share basically all
of the core features that make Zen the
Zen architecture but if you're looking
at different architectures do you have
things like you said cache size is a big
one
it depends ultimately on the kinds of
things you're processing so if you're
doing something that is really thrashing
the cache then having a superior cache
and one architecture versus the other
would lead into that adage of not all
gigahertz are created equal because if
it's cache thrashing and just hitting
constantly then having a faster cache or
bigger l1 so anything that's closer to
the CPU will be helpful you talked about
like l1 l2 l3 cache it's kind of it's
basically names like how close in
proximity physically is it to the CPU so
different cache sizes for each of those
will impact performance in great ways
not necessarily contingent on the
frequency as much as just like the cache
physical proximity to the cores and and
the size of the cache and speed of the
cache so that's one example Intel when
Rison one launched was about seven and a
half percent ahead an IPC this is
something AMD said even so that's an
example of where they had an IPC lead
intel's rise into caught up in a lot of
ways but Rison one there was about a 7.5
percent difference there so that's an
example of where clock for clock you
still had an instructions per clock lead
with Intel at the time obviously the
threaded multi-threaded performance is a
different story and another example of
not all gigahertz being created equal
because if you have a low frequency
processor with a ton of threads then
that frequency is going to be less of an
impact on things that care about threads
like blender or something like that and
frequency matters more for things like
premiere but ultimately just having
straight frequency if the rest of the
architecture doesn't line up doesn't
matter a whole lot because if you have 8
threads or 8 cores at 5 gigahertz versus
4 but the process of the product only
used
is for then doesn't really matter the
product in this case being like Adobe
Premiere I mean software product so
that's an example another one I took a
couple notes here let's see yet so I PC
I would say is more deserving of a
standalone video we might do that I'll
talk to some people
bottlenecking is also interesting here
so take Vega or Titan V GPUs we're on
both of those use HBM but the HBM is
kind of on Vega is a major bottleneck
point so as you overclock the core more
and more again not all gigahertz created
equal you keep pushing the core maybe
you push it another 50 megahertz or
something like that at some point major
diminishing returns are hit if you're
not also increasing the HBM clock in
most gaming applications not everything
but most gaming so in that instance it's
a case where you can keep pushing the
frequency but at some point having a
frequency that's 50 15 whatever 100
megahertz higher then the choke point on
memory it becomes irrelevant and that's
because the memory is now the bottleneck
and that's just because big architecture
happens to be very memory bandwidth
intensive you look at the GT 1030 this
is another great example so let's talk
about this one I set the GT 1030 this
gddr5 I think this is the g5 card I sent
the GT 10:30 with gddr5 the same
frequency as the one with ddr4 core
frequency and you know the same core
frequency it was a massive difference
like 50% differences with the gddr5 card
being faster so you're talking 2x
performance from baseline ddr4 card at
the same core frequency and that loss is
because of the memory bus and because
the memory bandwidth which is derived
from the memory bus and the memory speed
so that's another great example of the
core frequency gigahertz not being equal
because ultimately you ran into some
other barrier and I am NOT an expert on
like really low level architecture I'd
love to be but it's it's you know I kind
of I know my place and I've been
focusing on obviously learning as much
as I can but a lot of my job is talking
to people who know more than
and getting their insight and sharing it
with you so what I plan to do is
hopefully someday we'll I've got some
experts in mind who are brilliant and
we'll talk to them about IPC
specifically so I can expand on that in
a more competent and collected way but I
hope those examples help answer your
question next one
Gigi chb gig GHB says which moves it
more air one fan speaking of experts one
fan at 1500 rpm r2 at 750 stacked
together or in side-by-side config what
about noise and energy efficiency what
if the front fan slower than the rear
fan when stacked like in jet engines so
I'm pulling out my phone for reason here
I didn't speak to someone about this so
this is a fun question basically let me
boil it down to this if we have two fans
side by side that are 350 LPM linear
feet per minute of flow versus one
that's 700 is there a difference and how
much air is actually going into the case
we kind of have to do the physics thing
of like assume a spherical cow we have
to assume a whole lot of things here
like we're ignoring that the case
impacts air flow or ignoring a lot of
things let me read a response on this
from VSG from thermal bench PSG is one
of our experts we speak with he works he
he runs the thermal bench website it has
great resources for open-loop testing
that's and fantastic as well which we've
been talking to him about fantastic - so
I would encourage you to check it out
but he said feel free to paraphrase I
won't read it but honestly it comes down
to the specific fan and airflow
restriction in play the PQ curve of fans
isn't linear and airflow restriction is
certainly not so for higher restriction
applications such as radiators it is
possible that a single fan at 2,000 rpm
will fare better than two fans and push
pole at 1,000 rpm and this is assuming
other things effective in pitch and air
field combination are not a big factor
to give you an example I had tested this
with the Corsair h75 AIO it came with
two fans so I used one first and then
both and push pull and VSG gave me one
of his graphs we can share with you from
his website so these graphs are little
little complexes a lot going on but they
extremely helpful in detail PWM signal
percent is on the bottom and then the
rest of the data on the sides rpm on the
left and let's read the rest of his
response he said for a less restrictive
application to fans and push poll will
generally have lower noise for the same
amount of air pushed through all other
things being equal so that's why it was
popular to do so with water cooling back
when radiators were optimized for high
air flow and performance
now that operating noise has become a
priority in other regions than just
Europe radiators are designed
differently so push-pull is a waste of
money unless it's an aesthetic choice or
you are absolutely limited by radiator
space side by side versus push-pull
can't really be compared
since the airflow field is different so
hopefully that helps you out and that
goes back into what I was saying talking
with experts vs she does great work I I
would encourage you to check out that
chart you rewind it if you need to it
answers your question pretty damn well
next question is from lo1 or LOL i guess
ii 101 says how is the thermal
conductivity of the foil use for the
shirt of the foil years I would like my
shirt to conduct heat away from my body
also do you think the KB like our mobile
CPUs were in effect of Rison as well as
impending rise in mobile conductivity of
the foil we use I'm not sure maybe we
can get snowflake to test it she's the
one who oversees our testing operations
so I'll certainly ask her if we can
scrape some of it and find out what the
thermal conductivity is using some
high-end
thermal conductivity testing solution as
far as the question real question I
suppose or the secondary question
because let's face it this shirt is
pretty awesome and you should consider
picking one up on Stuart exit on that
next question do you think the KB like
our mobile CPUs we're an effect of Rison
as well as impending rise in mobile came
they are the whole everything to do with
AMD and Intel right now is really
interesting so first let me say this I
think Hades Canyon which is them working
together was a a really big kind of
warning shot to Nvidia and video
dominates that low-end sort of
not even low and just let's call it HTPC
devices look at ZOTAC there's small PC
boxes almost universally they've used
and video mobile GPUs or modern Nvidia
desktop GPUs now they've gotten topics
the laptops pretty much all used on
video GPUs they have like 90 plus
percent market dominance for GPUs not in
Taiwan's in laptops and so Hades Canyon
I honestly think scared and video quite
a bit and seriously I do think it was a
concern of theirs and that I think was a
response from Intel and AMD to Nvidia so
kind of different part of the question
of of Nvidia's market dominance and
Intel doesn't particularly like Nvidia
and vice versa so I would say that hades
Canyon and that product is a response to
Nvidia KB like our mobile CPUs things
like that I would say yes I do think
that Intel in general not even just with
this product but in general is
responding to AMD it's it's really
exciting to see we haven't seen this
kind of action in the CPU market in a
long time so yes
other examples of Intel responding to
AMD so one thing here before I get into
that when people talk about like this is
a response to X first keep in mind that
a lot of the products we see silicon
especially are in development for years
so like even just a case some of those
take two years to make so if you have
two cases launch that are pretty similar
to each other maybe five months apart
just remember the second one might have
still been in development two years ago
and they may have never known about it
until the other one launched and the
same goes for silicon for CPUs and GPUs
and so there are responses but for
things that kind of launched immediately
after rise and like coffee like coffee
like as an architecture is not a
response to rising it was going to
happen but what I think is a response is
things like the stack in terms of
pricing for how many cores you get or
marketing especially gigantic response
there and the bigger thing that Intel
has done is pull in all their launch
schedules X 299 was supposed to launch
at least a month later than it did three
weeks two
longer and they pulled that into
Computex of whatever year that was last
year I guess and that was a response to
thread Ripper absolutely the 28 core CPU
that was shown off prematurely that was
a response to thread report to coffee
Lake the you might remember the low-end
platforms non Z we're not launched with
the Z series they were launched later
and that's because the Z series was
pulled in with the 8700 K in 8600 K I
think and those were launched ahead of
time as a response to rise in gaining
popularity for high thread count users
so those are the responses now
architectural e I would say sort of late
this year and next year might be when we
start seeing the beginnings of
architectural responses not just like
marketing and pricing and timeline
responses so hopefully that that gives
some insight I think we'll also see
changes for spectrum meltdown and stuff
obviously but the answer is yes I think
there are responses but just remember
that architectural II that stuff it can
be years so they're probably pretty
locked in by the time the stuff is
shipping for a long time at that point
they're just doing fine-tuning and
there's still can be responses but a lot
of them are going to be less physical to
the hardware itself next one
zib Zoolander says if I put six Noctua
NF a 1225 fans and of course our 280x
will the build collapse into a black
hole time-sensitive question please
respond
next question Knight Rider 21 says hi
Steve you guys talk about overclocking
but doesn't make sense to buy an
unlocked CPU to undervolt and save on
noise I haven't actually tried this in a
while but a lot of the unlocked CPUs
I've worked with like in laptops you can
still undervolt them so I don't know
that you actually need one to undervolt
it's more of the ratio that gets
unlocked and the base clock so I don't
think you have to buy an unlock CP if
someone has tried recently please
correct me if I'm wrong in the comments
but last I tried was seventh gen and I
could still under volt below stock just
fine and I think that same was true for
8th gen anyway is it worth it yeah if
you want it to be quieter the way it
would work is you drop the voltage then
you can drop the fan speed significantly
and then then it could be pretty damn
quiet if you don't want to just invest a
lot of money and trying to silence like
with quieter fans or bigger cooling
radiators whatever so yeah well I would
say no it's not worth buying an unlock
Seaview for that purpose it is worth
buying a CPU and under-voltage because I
think you can do that anyway it's like I
said like you said we mostly do
overclocking so it's not something I try
a whole lot but yes I think pretty sure
on most platforms there's no problem
with doing that as long as the BIOS
permits it because it's not like it's
going up it's going down so yeah it's
worth under volting to reduce thermals
noise next one this name is awesome
banff hammer says what a monoblock add
more heat into the system and possibly
reduce clean components that matter if
the system is small it's going to depend
on the size of your cooling solution the
more liquid there is the more that heats
going to be spread out it will
ultimately yes impact things so a great
example of this with thermal data we've
tested it's not a literal mono blog was
pretty damn close we tested like it was
the FTW three or the gigabyte card or
whatever one of the water forest cards
where they had a copper cold plate it
hits the GPU and it expands out and hits
all the GDD are modules and some of them
expand out further and go to the vrm
it's a great way to cool all those
components with liquid without actually
having water flowing through blocks but
it
does it increase the GPU core
temperature and the same thing applies
here to what you're talking about so
just just translate what I'm saying to
CPUs but we did a test with a cold plate
on the GPU and then we did a test with
adding the expansion plate to cover the
vrm and the GDR memory and the GPU
temperature went up we'll call it but
that's because the cooling solution is
shared with more components so it's
dealing with more heat you might have
like say I don't know 100 watts 150
watts of heat or something like that
coming off of a silicon processor and
then you might have another 8 watts of
heat coming off the vrm or 15 or some
low amount and as long as your thermal
solution can handle it it's not that
much of a hike and it can be a benefit
for the other components things like
GPUs
the trouble is that they are more
frequency sensitive to thermals so an
extra 5 degrees can matter there but
with a CPU if you increase your CPU
temperature by a couple degrees because
you are now sinking the vrm as well it's
not normally a big deal unless you're
already like in the 90s so the answer is
yes it will impact it but maybe not
meaningfully I think we have to more
quickly
let's see Space Jam flam hey build Zoid
and Steve and Bill joy too knew how to
safely apply a liquid metal to Thane's
video you use the motherboard mounting
bracket as your only retention method
for the IHS so no glue or anything do
you think this is an adequate long-term
solution for me it would be on coffee
Lake horizontally mounted in the case
yes the answer is yes that bracket is we
we do the same thing I almost never put
adhesive on deleted components because
it kind of eliminates half the point of
deleting them because you're introducing
a gap now so I actually tried to avoid
adhesive unless I'm shipping it to
someone like if I ship a loose processor
out to another youtuber who wanted us to
delete it for them I'll seal it normally
was crazy glue or something but
otherwise I don't and that's because the
the clamping force on that socket is
significant and then you're gonna put a
cooler on top of it so
that thing's not gonna move it will not
move so I would not worry about that
aspect of things
next question last question tambourine
says you really got me with the get it
before it's gone forever at the end
there supreme marketing skills Steve
ordering one and a Matta
thank you very much for picking up the
mod Matt our next round some of you have
been asking it is almost here so email
support I gamers Atkins dotnet if you
need an update on that but we're pushing
them to ship them end of this week as a
filming so that would be week of the
fourth so end of this week we're hoping
they start shipping to us and we can
distribute them thank you're picking one
up and thank you for grabbing the
limited edition foil shirt you can get a
story to gamers next it's not net get
the other episode on the main channel we
film two main episodes they are both
pretty good
you get the bonus episode on patreon.com
slash gamers Nexus and subscribe for
more as always thank you for watching
I'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
