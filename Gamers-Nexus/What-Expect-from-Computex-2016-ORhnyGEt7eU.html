and it is one of the year's biggest
consumer electronics shows after the
Consumer Electronics Show in the US so
there were CES and January computex is
coming up now and computex isn't much
larger for the hardware industry in
general will be seen a lot of new
components coming out and that's what
we're talking about today it's basically
what to expect at computex and the
answer to that is a few things starting
with Intel's new broad well II and the
supporting motherboards so broad well
eat proper I'm not entirely sure when
that will be hitting the market but we
do know that the x99 motherboards the
refresh will be coming out very soon and
that's actually some of them are already
beginning to hit production ship and
things like that so these x99
motherboards they will work with broad
well II they of course work with the
older processors in the extreme series
as well and primarily it's a bios update
to support the new broad well each hip
and then there's also a couple of new
features on some of them for example you
dot to support on the gigabyte boards
that we saw at PAX East just recently
and that you dot to support is new to
these x99 boards it's sort of an
emerging standard for SSDs and it will
replace theta in some capacity but not
entirely so certainly expect x99 boards
the next thing would be the AIB partner
versions of the GTX 1080 maybe the GTX
1070 but certainly the 1080 the reviews
are already out ours are out and the 980
or 1080 hybrid conversion we did is out
but the AIB version of that will be
coming soon and hopefully with some
voltage mods or at least more power
supply to the card if not a different be
BIOS either way though the AIB versions
will have their better coolers so MSI's
got the traditional twin frozr that will
probably continue on the GTX 1080 series
EVGA with their acx cooler gigabytes got
their wind force and water fours and
things like that so all those will be
coming out soon look out for our
coverage of those at computex I'm sure
we'll be looking at some of it the next
thing we receive this information
through the interwebs and it's a new
CyberPower design for their upcoming PC
so you can see that on the screen now
but it's basically a weirdly tessellated
tower it's a super tower it's got this
tessellation on it that has the sort of
triangle effect that you're seeing
the aesthetic and being a super tower it
means it's large so technically from
what we understand it can fit 10 optical
drives but it will not actually host 10
optical drives it's not sought what
they're using the space for my guess is
that space will be used for liquids so
probably an open-loop reservoir or
something like that it's a ton of space
for open-loop cooling and it also has
4-way sli support from what we saw in
the rear i/o pictures you can see
there's clearly support for 4-way SLI
that I believe is shipping q 4 2016 and
the big thing is the super tower with
the sort of tessellated aesthetic so
that is what they're starting for that
one for a high-end enthusiasts rig the
next thing to look out for hopefully a
Polaris update so a Pascal of course has
been basically fully launched to this
point with GP 104 gp100 and the 1070 is
coming out with a cut-down I think
version of the GP 104 chip and then
polaris would be next and that's from
AMD so polaris is the proceeds viga
which proceeds na'vi and Polaris will
not have hbm too but it will probably
have gddr5 X and maybe hpm we're not
really sure yet though Polaris certainly
is going to be shipping some of the
mid-range low-end cards from what all
the rumors have said and that would be a
good place for Andy to enter the market
because it means that they don't have to
compete directly with NVIDIA with a 1080
so that gives both company some
breathing room to sort of solidify their
foundation on each part of the market
the high end in the mid or low end so
that is the AMD stuff we're hoping for
it and then lots of new cases so a ton
of new computer cases we're talking all
the major case manufacturers and pretty
much all of them have something new to
show us so we're gonna be doing our
usual walk through the show floor and
will show all that stuff off so that is
what to look out for at computex 2016
check this channel throughout the next
week because we'll be doing some factory
tours as well including a tour of in
wins facilities and NZXT keys facilities
on the case ID and I believe we might
visit some other folks as well so check
that out thanks for watching as always
patreon like the petrol video I'll see
you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
