- was one of the first if not the first
it's probably one of the first will say
that to invert the motherboard layout
obviously as you can see here this is
something that's been done more recently
by the Corsair 600c the be quiet cases
are capable of it and a couple of others
are as well but the Raven O two really
took a chance with it and in doing so
they also were able to elongate the case
like crazy it's it's pretty
disproportionately lawn and that's to
accommodate three 180 millimeter fans
that we just recently tested against a
couple of 200 millimeter fans and we
found that they were among the best
performing large fans of the time so
you've got three of the best fans of
this form factor in a large case that's
inverted the layout such that the air
from the bottom to Center fans goes
straight into a tower cooler and the
next two fans will go right in front of
the GPU or through the drive cages
before that this video is brought to you
by EVGA and the X 299 dark motherboard
for the Intel high-end desktop CPUs the
X 299 dark is one of the only
motherboards on the market with proper
vrm cooling we've tested this and found
significant performance increase over
those without active cooling on the BRMS
this board was used in our recent
attempts to set a top 10 record in fire
strike and you can learn more about the
X - 9 dark at the link in the
description below this was also from an
era when closed-loop liquid cooling was
not quite as popular there's not great
liquid cooling support in here today the
case has plenty of shortcomings that
wouldn't work out very well in the
modern market one such example would be
having one two three four optical drive
cages in the front so you got four or
five and a quarters you could put it in
if you want to do a bootleg operation of
mass-producing bootleg disks I guess
obviously that would never happen I mean
even you could leave one in there and
take the next three and just accommodate
another five hard drives which by the
way would make this an amazing server
case especially because it's already got
a 180 fan pushing air straight through
the drive cages but airflow was it's big
and for airflow the Front's completely
closed off and that makes sense because
it's pulling all the intake through the
bottom it's elevated pretty high about
an inch and it's got the three
high-powered vent these fans have a
built-in grill on the top that grill is
actually meant to help increase the
range so they're kind of long-range fans
and increases it in a way that when the
air goes through the fan it's almost
conical it's like completely straight
line in the shape of the fan itself so
that allows the air to get pushed
straight into the components another
aspect of this silverstone claimed at
the time that part of the cooling for
this case was stack effect cooling which
is more or less just a basic physics
principle of saying that because the
pressure orientation of the system and
because of the bottom intake you have a
stack effect as unlike a smoke stack a
chimney where the air is just going to
naturally grafton through the bottom
which is kind of odd because silverstone
has done a lot of good engineering work
here and they're giving a good amount of
credit in marketing to just physics
which I suppose sounds cool from a
scientific sound it makes them sound
like they're sciency but they're taking
credit away from their actual
engineering so it's a bit odd especially
because well you'll see a bit later but
one of the tests that we didn't do at
the time I should say I didn't it was
just me in 2012
working on this case was with the whole
stack effect cooling thing if you just
rotate the case does it perform the same
as when it's in its stock configuration
so if we rotate this in a way that it's
like that so the case is on its face and
the fans are now intake from here which
is this is the new front and the exhaust
is over there it's a standard case
layout at that point does it perform the
same does this stack affect cooling
actually have a meaningful difference or
advantage and spoiler alert the answer
is no but that's just because once you
have this many fans in it any natural
physics is just completely irrelevant
anyway intake on the bottom there's a
120 at the top for exhaust and that's it
other than that your power supply gets
air through the outside through the back
it has its own filter on it and then
that air comes out of the top here as
well right here are three switches to
control the speed of the fans and those
go from 1200 to about 800 rpm it's
actually quite a significant reduction
in noise which we'll talk about in a
moment and the kind of smaller gripes to
go over them not that you're buying this
case today but having these internal
doesn't make a lot of sense you have to
remove the panel to access them and this
panel and the bar act as kind of a cable
management solution because all of your
cables come out of here and you're
routing them this way so now if you're
removing the panel just to access your
fence which is kind of defeats a lot of
the purpose of what they're doing so
that was not choice this one does have
USB 3 in the front I think the original
original Raven O 2 did not but I'm not
positive on that USB 3 on the front they
do have the older style color cables so
it you know red yellow black all that
which we prefer Patrick not both because
you can actually see what the cables
doing as opposed to black out everything
that's modern today although it
certainly doesn't look as good kale
management features are pretty bad this
case is function focused it doesn't do
any work for you kale management wise at
all but it's well we'll see how it cools
today one thing that they did do really
well was the dust filters for the large
fans each one has its own dust filter
and the fans can be pretty easily
removed and replaced which we've done a
few times now so that's a that's all the
basics of the system the main thing here
is to test thermals and noise because
from a noise perspective you've got a
completely closed off front so no noise
is getting out over there which is where
the user will be positioned all the
noise is kind of lower in the case from
a thermal perspective you're feeding air
within 6 inches straight into a tower
cooler because again liquid coolers
weren't that common at this point and
also feeding air within an inch straight
into the GPU or well at least
found it not straight into it because it
is going kind of around either side of
the cart so let's go through the thermal
numbers and the noise and see how this
case holds up today so recapping the art
b02 has two advertised features that
could have interesting effect on
thermals and inverted layout and the
three Silverstone 180 millimeter air
penetrator fans pointed straight across
the motherboard we did our normal round
of test with the fans at max speed one
additional test with three air
penetrators set to low and a final test
with the entire case flipped onto its
front to eliminate the supposed benefits
of stack effect cooling it is scientific
fact that hot air rises but whether or
not this is enough to have an effect on
a tiny metal box with high rpm fans
blowing into it is doubtful molecular
movement increases about four percent
for every 25 C which is minimal when
compared to what large fans naturally do
starting with the big C be tortured
charged C be a delta T over ambient in
the torture test was forty three point
one degrees Celsius toggling the three
180 millimeter fans to their lower speed
and they only have to slowed them from
1200 rpm to 800 rpm but the CPU
temperature only rose a couple of
degrees to forty five point one on
inverting the case so to speak resulted
in a temperature barely higher than
baseline forty three point six which is
well within variance and error the three
large intake fans and smaller exhaust
fan push a huge volume of air and
predictably the passive effects of heat
rising are nothing compared to that if
it wouldn't obstruct air flow we could
flip the whole case upside down and get
the same temperatures the raven o2 cools
extremely well but it's because of
Silverstone's huge high quality fans and
short travel distance for the air that
the components are able to cool decently
not stack effect cooling silverstone
really should just take all the credit
for that one no needs market physics the
rb0 to easily tops our cpu cooling
charge and the only tests we've done
that resulted in lower cpu temperatures
were an alternate configuration of the
open air cougar conquer and a test of
dual 200 millimeter cooled aged 500 PE
without any front panel at all the only
stock case that even comes
hello this is another Silverstone
creation that's more recent and that is
the Silverstone our l06
which uses similar pressure and fan
placement configurations to the
venerable Raven for GPS water
temperatures the fairmark element of our
test pushed GPU temperature to forty
eight point three degrees Celsius that's
only changed by 0.2 degrees to forty
eight point one when the case was
rotated again demonstrating that the act
of cooling overwhelms any passive stack
effect lower fan speeds raised GPU
temperature to 51 point two degrees but
even that's not much of a change
relative to the reduction in our PM the
noise reduction is significant and
audible but the temperature increase is
hardly appreciable the Raven is beat by
one other stock case in the GPU cooling
category but it's another Silverstone
product the our l06 the PM o one is also
almost tied and the Roseville Cullinan
comes surprisingly close for a glass
sided case but no other unmodified case
is cooled quite as well
despite the inversion the path of air
across the motherboard is the same as it
is in a normal case so air is pushed
across the backplate and the GPU shroud
more than it is directly into the
heatsink if we were to cool the GPU with
a radiator placed above the airflow path
it would probably fare even better
3dmark generally causes higher
temperatures than our torture test but
the Ravens who handled it better than
anything else we've tested granting that
the PMA ones temperature of fifty point
five degrees over ambient is within a
margin of error of the RV zero to fifty
point three degrees if we ever tested
the RL zero six in this category I'd be
a strong contender but Silverstone is
unchallenged presently and in the very
least two of its cases are chart-topping
now the next best case after the PMA one
is again the Cougar conquer which has a
temperature several degrees higher we
added blender rendering to our list of
tests before 3d mark so the redline oh
six does appear here the RB 0-2 and RL
zero six operate within margin of error
of one another there is neither
appreciable nor measurable difference
between them like the other Silverstone
cases we keep mentioning the PMO one and
redline oh six a large volume of air is
pushed directly from the front of the
motherboard to the back
quickly the bottom to the top with the
inverted layout in the Raven oh - that
means it's directed straight into our
CPU air cooler which is oriented in the
same direction GPU rendering for blender
is the first chart where multiple cases
technically land ahead of the RB 0 - but
just barely the PMO one cooler conquer
and our l06 are all within margin of
error of the Raven rb0 - they are
functionally equivalent in performance
and we do not have the test resolution
to establish a clear difference again
two of those are Silverstone cases with
the same airflow pattern and the Cougar
concur is an open-air chassis that
barely insulates components at all for
noise at forty four point six DBA
doesn't make the RV zero to the loudest
case we've tested thanks to our recent
PMO one and PMO two tests but it's close
the raven notes who's saving greys is
the inverted layout which allows the
front panel to be completely sealed
while maintaining the same level of air
flow as the PMO one switching the fan
controllers to low reduced DBA to 36 a
huge reduction that's more than worth
the relatively small increase in
temperature unfortunately the fan
controllers are under the top panel and
inaccessible from the outside so it's
not something that can be adjusted on
the fly for daily use the 800 ish rpm
setting is much more practical so all
these years later about 6 the
silverstone rb0 2 is still more or less
the best performer on our charts in fact
at this point we're just up against
potentially others Silverstone cases
anyway it's the PMO one the raven o2 and
the redline o6 they're more or less the
top three so Silverstone's got a bit of
a three-peat going and the Raven o2
although its you can't really buy it
anymore
they do have other raven cases we
haven't looked at them but personally
speaking here i really hope they just
make another one of these basically the
same thing maybe a couple of modern
uplifts like the dr cages there are four
dr cages for optical drives obviously we
don't need those anymore so if I were to
modernize this case like let's let's
just do Steve designs a case let's let's
play that game I think okay more for me
than for you so if I'm designing this
case I want to keep all the core
features the same
like the inversion I like the three
bottom high-powered high pressure fans
silverstone still makes them or make
similar ones today
so we keep this basic idea I'd say
probably the next thing I'm doing is
finding a way to relocate these switches
to the front of the case so that it's
accessible and maybe out of third speed
in there depending on what fan is used
USB three on the front is good USB 3.1
type C would be even better for today
add one of those maybe other than that
the front the top panel are really fine
for the most part so next thing I'm
doing because there's really not much to
improve in terms of cooling at this
point is probably removing at least
three of these and duplicating this
setup up here and that would give you a
possible ten drive hard drives which
would be great for a home server setup
or a high-end workstation and with
high-end workstations you figure a lot
of the time you're using air anyway so
it doesn't need to be tremendous looking
clean support on the backside I would
add one or two probably two SSD sleds to
the back of the motherboard tray and
then I would take the rear panel and
give it a maybe another tenth of an inch
of space so there's better cable
management possibilities with ideally
and added something to help with Caleb
management either tie-down points or
maybe a small cable management bar that
could help compress the cables when
there's a whole bunch of them back there
especially the 24 pin because that's
kind of problematic I'm not sure that
there needs to be any more space at it
to the bottom or the top or anything
like that the only thing you're lacking
and all of this is liquid clean support
technically you can remove these fans
and mount radiators but this case just
does really well with air and air is not
necessarily interesting to people who
are buying high-end $200 cases sometimes
they often want to go up and move now I
say often it's still a really small
segment of the market but I don't know
maybe if you were to make eliminate some
of my ideas here and instead of going
high-end workstation you go high-end
enthusiasts you could still keep a lot
of drive cages but get rid of these bays
and if needed add some height and pop a
reservoir mountain there and now you can
support liquid
: if you want it the biggest problem
that was at that point you should
probably have a radiator that's whatever
180 times three is in size because
that's what the that's the next
challenge because those fans are just
obviously not gonna cool a smaller ad do
that well they're not meant for it so
that's how I would do it I still really
like the case I think it could still
sell today especially with the
performance versus everything being
awful so Silverstone if you're watching
and I think you are then you know
consider it let's let's let's figure
something out bring this one back
because I really liked it and I think it
is one of the best cases we've ever
worked with and in fact it probably is
the probably my favorite case I've
personally worked with so if I had to
actually choose something out of all the
cases we reviewed put my own system and
it's either this or on the opposite end
the be quiet dark Bass Pro 900 which I
just liked for other reasons it's not
that great at cooling but yeah this is a
big big big success in my eyes so
hopefully it comes back but either way
it's fun to look back at something from
2012 and also I think there was one
launched in 2009 as well but yeah
