also revisit one of Andy's older CPUs
against a modern suite of processors but
we weren't sure at the time which one to
revisit the Phenom 2 series eventually
struck us as a perfect option to cover
once again given its widespread adoption
and high ratings on old product pages
and it's quite old at this point but
still something that people use and
these flagship phenom 2 CPUs were all
built on 45 nanometer fabrication
process and targeted to compete with 45
nanometer Linfield core i5 CPS from
going to hail online today we're
revisiting the Phenom 2 CPUs before that
this video is brought to you by course
there's a new Vengeance RGB LED Ram
which ships with custom screens ICS for
better overclocking performance and
stability given that memory is highly
relevant for performance with new rise
in CPUs now is a good time to do
research on high performance kits
start with the Vengeance RGB LED kit at
the link in the description below to
provide some historical context on these
CPUs and the launched 2 phenom 2 x6 CPUs
in April of 2010 starting with a 1055 T
which we have here and the 1090 T Black
Edition which we've got right here that
were revisiting today this launch had
the 1090 T price at 295 dollars out of
the gate and the 1055 T price at $200
originally though it dropped a little
bit later in December of 2011 down to
$150 MSRP for the 10:55 T with a 1090 T
also seen reductions this reduction was
partly in response to Sandy Bridge which
came out in early 2011 and also in
response to Andy's new architecture
bulldozer which came out after the
Phenom 2 line so I kids everyone some
basic context the 1090 T black edition
was the higher-end option and the 1055 T
was more of the mid-range unit again at
$200 and the Phenom 2 CPUs had a really
short period to shine but they did shine
when they launched they competed with
the i-5 in the Hale M CPS directly that
would be Linfield of the time again 2010
first quarter first half anyway and
later on about one year later first half
of 2011
the Sandy Bridge line would begin the
ship with the first round of CPUs
hitting market in first quarter of 2011
meaning that phenom 2 was sandwiched
between what is arguably one of Intel's
of best architectures or at least most
interesting even compared to today is
given the limited gains from Intel
lately and one of Andy's the next
architecture is bulldozer phenom 2 was
right before those 2 launches so it was
limited and we're revisiting it today so
we're never enough to speed on the time
looking back to an intact initial review
we see that they indicated the Phenom
tears performed well against Intel's
2010 quad-core CPUs for production that
were behind and lightly threaded
applications like games that's somewhat
familiar even 7 years later with risin
and Intel's current KB like CPUs after
it launched these two and the Phenom 2
CPUs that were followed by the 10:35 t10
45t a different 1055 T than the one we
tested a 1065 T a 1075 T and finally the
1100 T Black Edition CPU just like
horizon these CPUs weren't actually
different beyond some clock and voltage
changes which means that overclocking a
1055 T to 1090 T clocks would get you
the same performance just like
overclocking a 1700 to an 1800 X clock
will get you the same performance on
Rison before jumping into the test we've
got an overclocking chart on the screen
now note that testing methodology and
overclocking details are linked in the
article below including some the guides
reference for overclocking phenom these
were a bit different to overclock than
the chips of today and there are a few
more numbers to tune we've got them on
the screen but more information in the
article for the rest on that
let's open up with some rendering and
synthetic benchmarks starting with
blender blender kicks us off on the x6
CPUs and should be an interesting place
to gauge how some of the earliest
consumer six cores have held on at stock
speeds the 1055 T is officially the
slowest CPU we've tested in blender
taking nearly 2 hours to render the 4k
image that an i7 2670 3.9 minutes the
1090 T didn't fare much better at about
a hundred minutes to complete for a
modern comparison from AMD the r7 1700
at 303
dollars that we praised recently is
priced similarly to the aged phenom to
1090 t but completes the same render in
30 minutes
stock settings overclocking the Phenom 2
CPUs allows the render to finish
significantly faster with a twenty six
point eight percent reduction time
required to 1055 T which is now down to
80 minutes and a 19 point one percent
reduction in time required to attend 9dt
that lands both CPUs ahead of the
overclocked 2500 K ahead of the stock FX
83-70 which was released several years
later and about two percent behind the
i5 4690k three fresh everyone the 4690k
uses 22 nanometer process and launched
four years after the 1055 TN 1090 T with
a launch MSRP that was $45 higher a more
blender ready CPU like the 2600 K which
was a hyper threaded i7 completes the
render in 74 minutes stock or about 55
minutes one overclock Cinebench is a
synthetic benchmark that got a lot of
focus during rise ins launch and
marketing so we're going to include it
here to provide some comparisons and
baselines against modern CPUs the extra
threads on the Phenom 2 x6 CPU benefit
us with this test pushing the stock 1090
T ahead of the i5 2500 K or the
overclocked 1090 T and 1055 T
overclocked ahead of the overclocked
2500 K again we end up just behind the
4690k once again when considering only
multi-threaded performance that said in
single threaded performance both the
10:55 TOC and 1090 TOC score lower than
every CPU except the FX 8270 piledriver
cpu which again launched after both b10
55t and 1090 t will point out that the
2600 k cost $317 at launch $22 higher
MSRP than the 1090 t and 30% greater in
stock performance incentive inch
multi-threaded although the processors
had probably been discounted by then the
SMB launch came shortly after phenom
Pugh and bulldozer later drove prices
down to compare against andcbs today the
x6 1090 T overclocked performance lands
at at 596 multi-threaded and 104
single-threaded
whereas the r7 1700 stock performance
landed
at 1421 multi-threaded and 149
single-threaded
our 7 1700 stock cpu performs about 2.4
times faster and multi-threaded
Cinebench testing than the Phenom 2 1090
T overclocked CPU which was the flagship
of its era like Blender Adobe Premiere
gives us a real-world benchmark of the
CPUs rendering performance our premier
test uses our EVGA icx review posted in
February but it was also a test built
for modern CPUs like Rison the port
phenom 2 chips sadly have a lot in front
of them to handle because this is a
heavy workload built for modern
processors to give perspective on how
the Phenom sees I've aged in Vermeer we
see that our overclocked
1055 T completed rendering in 246
minutes or over 4 hours this would be
the same time requirement as the 1090 T
over clocks for what it's worth in the
same way that an overclocked 1700 and an
overclocked 1800 X have the same clock
for clock performance when you're
testing in any application at all really
like pov-ray tests that are in the
article the premier test has only
recently been introduced and therefore
is it limited in how many devices are on
the bench the previous maximum time was
160 three point six minutes for the i-5
7200 K with a minimum CPU render time of
58 minutes on the 16 900k cuda renders
of the same scene completed in about 20
minutes and the r7 1700 finished in 73
minutes stock or about 62 minutes when
overclocked which again was impressive
for that CPU at this point almost any
modern affordable GPU will weigh out
render the Phenom Zinn premiere and if
you're looking to upgrade CPUs there are
seven CPU is a breeze past the Phenom is
a few times over when looking strictly
at the production workloads which is
where rise and shines for 3d mark charts
and notes on times by issues check the
article linked in the description below
but now we're going to get started with
some of our game benchmarks we look
first to watchdogs
2 for a modern heavily threaded title
our overclocked 1055 T outperforms the
1090 T in this title thanks to higher
memory frequency but the average is
still just 48 fps or about 27% increase
over stock performance an X CPU up is
the i3 6300 which netted to the
for FPS average 41 1% blows and 3401 1%
blows that's about 13 percent faster and
averages than the overclocked phenom 2
CPUs and a modern r7 1700 priced around
$330 performs at 84 fps stock or in the
90s when overclock the 7700 K 4
perspective pushes 113 FPS average 1
under stock configurations the phenom
tcp is wood bottleneck most modern video
cards in this game including at the gtx
1060 RX 480 and RX 580 and up cards and
so if this is what you're running in
trying to upgrade video cards it's
probably time to upgrade the cpu as well
moving now to total war Warhammer the
Phenom 2 x6 10:55 TC view operates at 65
FPS average with the overclocked 1055 T
at 83 FPS average for an uplift of 28%
that puts it behind the i5 2500 K from
2011 about a year after the Phenom
launched and that's at 92 FPS average
for the 2002 K no 2500 K has not been
retested with the total war patch that
improves frame time performance for all
CPUs including the Intel and and the
horizon processors this means that any
CPU you see in this chart without an
asterisk next to its name it would
perform a few percentage points higher
in averages with the patch and there
would be bigger gains for low values so
keep that in mind that said it's only a
few percentage points in averages so
this still serves as a good comparison
considering we're looking at the chip
that is 7 years old the 1090 teased
higher core overclock isn't as helpful
as a memory overclock on the 1055 T
showing an additional choke point in the
platform and finally the i7 2670 Neph PS
average GTA 5 has had some issues with
higher frame rates that we've recently
detailed and originally exposed in
January but as these phenom devices are
slow enough to dodge the higher speed
issues we can still use GTA 4 this test
the 1055 T overclocked 6 core runs an
average FPS of about 81 with the stock
performance at around 62 FPS average
loads are reasonable across the board as
we don't encounter the stutter issue at
this low of a frame rate and the i5 2500
K runs its average at 101 fps the lowest
scoring Intel device on the band
and these FX 83 74 point of reference
was the previous lowest score on the
bench at a 93 FPS average taking it
around 15% faster than the overclocked
1055 T battlefield want overclocking at
10:55 T or 1090 T CPUs improves us to
north of 60 fps across averages and lows
serving over franzine's and producing a
frame rate that in years of the FX 83-70
cpu keep in mind of course that if
you're playing a heavily loaded of
multiplayer matches with a lot of actors
on the screen these numbers will go down
but they would go down linearly and
we're just looking at Delta's here
anyway for point of reference the i7
2670 nefb s average one stock about 132
FPS average overclocked and the 2500 K
runs its average at about 115 fps stock
and finally ashes of the singularity was
basically non-functional with the CPU we
had some issues with the X 12 games in
general and x 5 was another one which is
a DX 12 test so there are some issues
that we ran into with the X 12 we were
able to run some of those pests like
ashes it's just the performance was
really not great to the point that it's
not worth talking out in the video
however if you want to see the ashes
charts including escalation they're
linked in the article in the description
below so that you can read them in the
article they're by Patrick Layton but
talk about the conclusion here so the
Phenom 2 it's kind of fun to revisit
because the historical context of the
Phenom 2 when it launched that was a
pretty serious era for CPUs we're
looking at just after that launch just
after 2011 there was sort of a
stagnation for our market for the
enthusiast market in terms of CPU
performance and growth from basically
2011 until now more or less because any
of the Intel upgrades in between have
been pretty unexcited if you're running
something like a Sandy Bridge CPU
already in fact we've said a few times
lately about a 2600 K to maybe a 7700 K
ignoring AMD for a moment if you're
looking at linear upgrades only that's
pretty good but anything below that was
really on exciting and the Phenom 2
hasn't aged in quite the same way that
the 2600 K has but it's also a bit older
it's 45 nanometer manufacturing process
and it competed with Nehalem the
Linfield CPUs on the i-5
so that's even a generation back from
Sandy Bridge that's how far back we're
looking they did well for considering
how old they are but yeah if you have
one it's probably time to start thinking
about an upgrade at least especially if
you're already looking at GPU upgrades
because you're definitely bottlenecking
any type of modern GPU from those or
maybe the $100 GPUs would skate by but
anything over that CV upgrades in order
now that said the stuff to look at would
be Rison so we have our Rison tests the
most recent one would probably be the
rise in revisit that's what we would
encourage you to look at because that's
got the most up-to-date numbers from us
and then we also revisited the 2200 k
and 2500 k if you're interested in those
types of tests we have a bit more
commentary on the era and the
performance of those chips there but
overall pretty fun project it is always
cool to look back in a history phenom to
came out before we started reviewing
CPUs officially so there's a bit of a
learning process just to read about all
the old architectures always fun to do
