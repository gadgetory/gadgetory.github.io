today officially revealing the details
of its upcoming stadia game a streaming
service that we've heard about for a
while now this is the service where
Google is partnering with AMD on
hardware solutions and is hoping to
offer a stream to home service for
playing games the intention is for
stadia to be usable anywhere and that
will of course require a few a few
things like a decent internet connection
it's not quite anywhere and also you
need a compatible device currently
Google lists the compatible or supported
devices as quote laptops desktops pixel
3 and pixel 3a for mobile and beyond
that we're not 100% sure what the
requirements are but we do have some
requirements on the internet speeds and
then we also have information on the
pricing the games that will be available
and other launch timelines before that
this video is brought to you by the
gigabyte zee 390 ARS master motherboard
which comes equipped with one of the
more powerful z3 90 V RMS for heavier
overclocks on the new 9th gen intel cpus
the ARS master is also one of the few
motherboards with a real heatsink this
generation featuring a mix of high
surface area fins and looks oriented
hover blocks oh and it's also got
updated RDV illumination learn more at
the link below the first package that
Google will make available will be
stadia Pro which is a $10 per month plan
to allow up to 4k 60fps streaming that
periodically adds free games beginning
only with destiny 2 at launch a $130
founders Edition like the name Nvidia
used to confuse everybody will come with
three free months of stadia pro and
it'll also have a buddy pass for three
months to share with a friend there will
be a controller included and a google
chromecast ultra with the package as
well and a founders stadia name which we
had to look into what that means in the
fine print apparently a founders stadia
name is quote a stadia name identifying
themselves in stadia with no numerical
identifiers Auto appended so this is as
far as forced benefits go to attempts to
justify the price of something this is
this pretty high up on the list but
beyond that stadia pro launches in
November for the EFI version
and customers will will get that a
couple months earlier in the least
otherwise everything launches in 2020
with no firm date announced as of yet
stadia base is potentially the more
compelling service so stadia base won't
launch until sometime in 2020 users will
be able to buy and stream games at 1080p
60fps with bitrate not firmly identified
as of yet and that's without paying a
subscription fee so you pay for the game
you can stream the game and that's sort
of the start in the end of the
transaction this begins to treat the
Google platform more like a standard
digital storefront something like Steam
or the epic game store or similar
options rather than a monthly
subscription service Google breaks its
streaming solutions into a couple of
internet speed suggestions so based on
the infographic on its website google
says at 720p 60fps with stereo sound
google recommends a 10 megabit per
second download speed although no upload
speed is identified right now 1080p 60
with 5.1 surround recommends 20 megabits
per second down fork a 60 with 5.1
recommends at 30 to 35 megabits per
second down but also requires the paid
package monthly of stadia and this we
should note is something we've
experienced before so NVIDIA attempted
to do it's a grid solution which later
was renamed to GeForce now and the last
time we worked with GeForce now was at a
CES suite as a preview and NVIDIA had
everything hooked up via fiber-optic
cable in a hotel room with a $300 router
all of this is relevant because in a
room full of press Nvidia asked if
anybody wanted to try GeForce now and
used as its example titanfall 2 which
many of you are likely aware is one of
the most latency sensitive games you
could possibly demo so as far as a
stream your games over the internet
solution goes titanfall taters should
more or less instantly bring out any
shortcomings in the latency and in the
experience for how the the player can
interact with a highly timing sensitive
game no one volunteered to play so I did
and the comment that I made after
testing out titanfall 2 with GeForce now
- the Nvidia people was is is the
latency
on this demo because of the hotel
internet by which I was meaning to imply
is the bad latency with the really
really laggy feeling response time a
result of bad I gave them an out is it a
result of the bad internet in the hotel
and they said yes the latency is as good
as it is because we have fiber optic
lines of a $300 router hooked up on
Internet so clearly not quite aware of
the situation but I did clarify later so
anyway the point of that is that g-force
now was a very serious project and still
is and it's one that Nvidia really
worked on hard for engineering solutions
for the problem of latency for input
latency specifically when you hit a
button on the controller does it feel
like the game is responding in the same
amount of time as if you're playing it
locally on your own system and Vidya had
a lot of trouble tackling that they've
gotten better of course with time but
the initial launch was pretty rough to
be honest so with Google stadia we're
curious to see if the stadia will
encounter the same learning curve that
Nvidia did or if they're gonna come out
of the gate with a more refined solution
that can learn from Nvidia's own
research even though they're not working
together AMD is working with Google on
this one anyway these solutions will all
encounter latency challenges and making
sure that the input feels like it should
feel versus a locally played game the
games that are announced as of now and
eventually will be available for
purchase on stadia include the following
Dragon Ball xenoverse 2 doom eternal
Wolfenstein Youngblood destiny 2 Power
Rangers paddle for the grid
really Baldur's Gate 3 Metro Exodus
thumper grid Samurai Shodown football
manager 2020 get packed the Elder
Scrolls online at the crew to the
division 2 Assassin's Creed Odyssey
Ghost Recon breakpoints at trials rising
NBA 2k Borderlands 3 farming simulator
19 there's only a couple more Mortal
Kombat 11 rage 2 Final Fantasy 15 gilt
tomb raider trilogy Darksiders Genesis
and Just Dance 2020 again that's
available for purchase the only game as
of now today that come
for free with with any with the
subscription for google stadia is
destiny to everything else require a
subscription for a higher quality
streaming like 4k 60 or just to play the
game at all you can purchase the game
and stream it in lower quality without a
subscription I stated earlier 1080 for
example 60 but anything higher all we
require a subscription bungees shadow
keep expansion stream took place
immediately after the stadia stream
where Bungie confirmed that destiny 2 is
getting a basic free-to-play released on
Steam moving to steam now and the whole
package including the DLC all the DLC
and shadow keep is $60 on stream so that
is going to be included for and in
quotes here free with the pro version of
stadia that the quotes there being
because you're still paying monthly is
really paying $10 per month or you pay
$130 for the founders edition to get it
3 months early and get a special name
without a number at the end of it or
something but Saranya after after you
hit the six month point you should have
just bought it on Steam or something
instead but either way that's what
Google's big announcement was it's just
that after Bungie went and announced
that they're releasing a version of
destiny 2 for free on Steam not all of
it but a good part of it and also you
can buy destiny 2 for reasonably priced
on Steam as well it does take a bit of
the wind out of the sails of the Google
announcement gilt and get packed or a
stadia exclusive right now Baldur's Gate
3 notably is not stadia exclusive but it
also doesn't have a release date yet
it'll be coming to PC eventually so you
don't have to get stadia for that
release date is TBD it is not
necessarily coming out in November one
thing to keep in mind here one thing
that we're a bit concerned about from a
consumer standpoint is that Google does
have a history of terminating quite a
lot of its services and products Google
glass for example although it's come
back in some capacity very recently and
in the business of terminating products
and services you have to be a little bit
concerned as a consumer of what happens
to your purchases if it goes away the
same concern exists with steam to some
extent although steam is
is proven at this point it is firmly
secure in its position as of now so not
a big concern anymore but something to
keep in mind is that Google needs to
prove itself here the stadia controller
is the only dedicated Hardware announced
for the service so far and it's not
required to use the service but it does
come with the founders edition it also
comes with a dedicated google assistant
built into it if you want something to
spy on you and have some game capture
buttons as well the controller alone is
$70 the Xbox one controller just for
perspective if you don't really pay
attention to them are about $40 at
present the founders Edition will be
only available and the countries we've
got listed here many of these countries
ranked high on the list of countries
with fastest internet options out there
the USA notably does not but it is
available in the u.s. Belgium Finland
Canada Denmark France Germany Ireland
Italy Netherlands Norway Spain Sweden
the UK and the US excluding Hawaii and
Guam we'll all have Google stadia
available and then for a short list here
of the benefits of pro vs. base Google's
got some notes on that as well $10 a
month for pro and three months of that
are included with the $130 you pay for
founder's Edition the resolution with
pro is up to 4k with base it only goes
up to 1080p the frame rate is 60fps for
both capped max and the sound is 5.1
with pro it's more of a home theater
than not if you're a PC play don't need
to worry quite as much about this sound
is stereo for bass and the kind of funny
thing to note is that Google's graphic
does say both Pro and bass allow you to
give them money whenever you want to so
that's great news additional free games
released regularly apparently yes with
stadia Pro starts with destiny to the
collection does not name games
immediately on the horizon and then
stadia Pro exclusive discounts will be
available on apparently select purchases
with Pro but not with bass although the
extent of those discounts is not known
yet so there's a lot of stuff here a lot
of promises where Google needs to to
prove itself what it's actually planning
to do with those
it's AMD stated in an email to us that
the Radeon data center GPUs to support
Vulcan and Linux based code on Google
stadia will be used as something we've
known for a while now so this is not
news but it does research and these
partnership with Google on this project
in addition Google and AMD this is a
quote from them are offering a wide
range of developer tools to optimize
performance and capabilities of AMD
Radeon GPUs interestingly some games
like Final Fantasy 15 that are included
in this list of stadia games do have a
lot of Nvidia features like hair works
for instance where you can use them with
AMD cards but it's not typically a great
experience it's also not typically a
great experience on NVIDIA cards to be
fair so we're curious to see if those
options remain and how it'll work out
it'll be interesting from a benchmarking
perspective we also don't know the
extent to which graphics settings tuning
will be available if at all via stadia
right now and if there's there's still a
lot we need to see on how exactly this
works and video not partnering with
stadia or Google on this is not
surprising because and video likely sees
stadia as a competitor to its own
GeForce now I mentioned earlier and
probably has higher pricing in same
reason they kind of stay out of consoles
and videos got its Nvidia is in a
position where it can demand a lot more
from partners and if it feels that their
competitors probably will just not work
with them at all so that more or less
recaps it in absence stadia bases you
can buy games just like a digital
storefront and that's the start in the
end of it and then you can stream them
rather than play them on a local system
this is beneficial entirely and mostly
only if you have a system that doesn't
meet the requirements maybe you've got a
laptop or an older computer that's not
well equipped or if you're trying to do
something like stream via chromecast
which is included with the founders
Edition version of stadia or the pro
founders Edition version
additionally streaming via the pixel 3
is something that is worthy of note and
then the rest we will have to see how it
works out this is probably not so
that most of the PC enthusiasts in our
audience will particularly care about
right now because it doesn't require
building a high-end machine to use that
said game streaming we think eventually
will be a significant market a
significant part of the gaming or the PC
hardware economy because it's kind of
like movies on demand over time as these
servers that run the games remotely get
better as the latency gets better for
input it does seem like it's a natural
step to start doing games on demand just
just like movies on demand so that
people who are more mainstream not in
our audience people who have no
knowledge or understanding or desire to
learn about things like PC hardware that
would be really the the primary target
if you can hit those people with games
on demand where all they do is run the
game off their Smart TV then that does
seem like a potentially big audience now
how it works out technologically that
remains to be seen because it thus far
games as a an online service stream to
have had a rough start it's probably
something that will eventually be
conquered but we just don't know when
yet anyway that'll recap the Google
stadia announcement let us know what you
think below we are genuinely curious
likely a lot of you are going to have a
negative response to this but for those
of you who are excited about this let us
know why because we're curious what our
audience thinks and specifically what
parts of this announcement do you find
our either very interesting to you or
promising or on the other side what
parts of the announcement do you find to
be comical or just completely
uninteresting to you as a PC enthusiast
and that will help us figure out how
much we should cover this going forward
