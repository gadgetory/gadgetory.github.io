nexus donna and we are here at pax used
to 2014 this is day two I think it's
been quite a quite a launch start i'm
here with chris Roberts of cloud
imperium games and we spoke to Chris on
Thursday about the dogfighting module
which is coming in the pending weeks or
next month sometime and check that link
in the description below if you are
interested but today we're talking about
FPS mechanics of star citizen which
haven't been delved into too much so far
and I can't talk too much about them
because we're going to do a reveal later
on this year but I can give a few
tippets of some of the cool stuff will
do very cool so starting with the easier
stuff in an FPS gameplay sort of the one
of the driving forces of star citizen is
the realism and obviously you've got
your own rules in the universe so just
like sorts you know it's realistic
within the universe of star citizen and
being fun just like George Lucas has his
own rules with realism in the FBS side
we've got a concern of respawning and
death and lethality of weapons that have
you thought about how you're addressing
that thus far Wow so we're not with
you're basically sort of respawn in in
the star citizen world is not sort of
the insta respawn you get shot and you
back into a barrel so kind of the way
we're looking at is sort of a more
hardcore tactical shooter so you know
you'll you'll get hit you'll take limb
and body damage you kind of get a
critical hit you know you're you're sort
of frat you know your team or whatever
it would be in the boarding party
basically needs to drag you from the
front lines and then back and they can
patch you up or if you've got a bigger
ship that has a med bay maybe you know
patch you up a little better and then at
that point you know you're you're fairly
damaged and beating up and you'll have
to be taken to the new nearby planet or
a nearby space station to get fixed up
because if you don't do it in a certain
amount of time you'll basically bleed
out so so kind of the mechanics are not
that
yeah so it sort of critical hit doesn't
necessarily mean instant permadeath
right away you can save it so can i I'm
hoping that there'll be some kind of
good combat where it's sort of like you
know you've gotta like covering fire
pull back your wounded comrade and then
get them off and get them help within a
certain amount of times that's a whole
extra level of gameplay and if you if
you do that then you sort of save what
we've been calling sort of one of our
lives in the sort of whole death of a
spaceman kind of analogy we had so it
think it'd be kind of fun but yeah it's
going to be mostly I think would be a
lot of I think there'll be a lot of
tactics I think there'll be a fair
amount of cat and mouse it obviously
depends on the size of the ship you're
going to be fighting over but you know
in the smaller ones there isn't really a
lot of a lot of room some of the bigger
ones like the address frigate now we
sort of built extra crawl spaces and
stuff in so you should be able to like
you know have some interesting stuff and
then you'll be able to mess around with
things like gravity and also spacing
areas on a ship so I think there'll be a
whole bunch of stuff that you don't
normally see in first-person shooters
they'll give an extra wrinkle how
frequently these players getting
involved are engaged in a firefight on
foot I don't know a sort of depend mean
I think it would depend on kinda what
your focus was so I would think that if
you were sort of focused on like
capturing and taking other ships you'd
do it a lot more than obviously someone
that's just training trading or
something like that so it's kind of hard
to say I mean you know maybe twenty
percent of the game I mean it's sure
it's kind of it's sort of I could just
see some people like spending thirty or
forty percent of the time doing and some
people spending like two percent of the
time doing it you know we talked about
having some you know planetside areas
that there can be some first-person come
back I think there could be some
interesting stuff if we do some
exploration &amp;amp; salvage stuff you know I
think of the you know what you know the
aliens style thing where you go and
there's this derelict rack and maybe
there's some creatures that attack you
which would be kind of fun there
wouldn't be that hard for us to do and I
think it would just make an environment
just feel a bit more alive
have you thought about a the FPS
gameplay sort of within the the
simulator environment the I think arena
commander Rita commander yes no we
haven't I mean arena command is really
just for the space combat so we haven't
thought of like arena granite commander
first-person module so we were thinking
that was more just part of the game
itself ok we're going to have a
standalone FPS like when we do the
module will be a standalone FPS module
where we'll just be sort of combat
aboard a derelict space station and then
later and then later on we're folding it
in with a dogfight where there'll be a
whole boarding action that will happen
on our interests and the the interest
being one of the massive ships if you
haven't checked it out yes it's much
bigger than now that used to be it was
100 meters no no no it was 120 meters
now is 245 yeah so it's big big change
is but it'll have the turret on the back
yes there was quite a few turrets on it
and a big missile bay and the rail gun
on the center spine so yeah I mean
that's quarter of a killer meet along
now it used to be obviously half the
size of that so it's pretty big
obviously not speaking some of the
bigger ships but yeah so it should be
alright it's got crawl spaces we built
into it so that should be interesting
for the FPS stuff have you thought about
weapons class yeah I mean we have we
have you know so we have ballistic we
have energy weapons you know your
pistols salt rifles shotguns electric
shotguns you know all that kind of stuff
sort of grenade launcher rocket launch
electric shotgun function well it's just
a big sort of electric charge so I think
a lot of damage like a Taser on
electricity seems to work well against
humans yeah yeah so yeah there's a full
range of weapons you'll be able to buy a
full range of weapons all the different
shops you go around and customize your
loadout and I think any any aspiring
spaceman needs to at least have you know
be packing some personal level of heater
so customization you just mentioned
any anything you can say about weapons
customization or loadout customization
well I mean you know will allow I mean
they'll be you know kind of like we do
on the vehicle stuff is like you know
you'll be able to you'll have your
weapons and then to be you know be able
to add laser sights or great you know
silences all that the standard kind of
like attachments you could do for
weapons and ammo types any thoughts on
that uh well yeah I mean there's you
know the very I mean there's a lot of
the energy types that and ballistic
types that we have in space okay so it's
kind of all the ones you would expect
mean this laser Neutron plasma you know
various different levels of ballistic
like armor piercing or different caliber
sizes so you can have and we also have
like a crossbow and stuff like that so
you know it all depends because some of
the weapons will have downsides to using
them and sort of the word right so you
don't want to use too big of an
explosive weapon inside a ship because
you could basically you know crate you
know a fishery at all right yeah yeah
and then then you know all sudden you
get your decompressing and we're gonna
have decompression all that set yeah
that's that's alright so I haven't
actually read about that I think we
talked previously actually about being
able to destroy systems on the ship on
voice yes in satchel charges or
something yeah yeah especially on the
bigger ships oh yeah all like bigger
capital ships have like a whole
complicated set of systems just like the
fighters do but on the bigger ships that
spread out and there's a lot of like you
know you have your engineering and you
know weapons and how and all the rest of
stuff so there's the ability for you to
like disable parts of the ship and
there's also a mini game between you
know shutting down areas shutting down
bulkheads disabling it going on fixing
areas other people with disabling you
know like taking out the power plant to
incapacitate the ship and close off
sections of the ship be able to change
the gravity and sections of the ship be
able to vent areas that shit all those
kind of things
dealing with gravity I think I read
there are plans for magnetic boots yeah
now we have we're gonna have we're gonna
have ever so we'll have magnetic boots
we're going to have basically like you
know little jet pack stuff you can do
and then we'll allow you to also be
pushing off and grabbing in zero-g any
thoughts on armor yet for an infantry
well we just we have we have multiple
levels of armor so you know sort of the
medium and the heavy and the super-heavy
style by allama they both have all got
advantages and disadvantages the heavier
stuff obviously is more sturdy and
actually better for you know in some
cases e VA but obviously won't be as
light can't move as quickly etcetera etc
that's planetside plaintiff yes at all
or is that kind of a now we're going to
have so much the planetside is safe but
there will definitely be some areas
planetside that we will have some first
person we actually announced it's a
stretch called a while ago and then you
know and we're going to mix it up so it
won't always be boarding so there'll be
some fun stuff where you know for
instance if you're you know
investigating a deserted asteroid or
derelict alien spaceship maybe there's
some creatures will jump out and attack
you and you'll have to be armed and
blasting away alien style so so we'll
have some fun with it any chance for
player-controlled regions on planets or
pastoring I will not not planets at the
moment but definitely there's going to
be some player control persistent areas
so like asteroid bases some space
stations you know and so we're trying to
think about ways to have different
player groups be able to own some level
of real estate or control in planets or
systems so there's something for
everyone to fight over so that's one of
the core parts of obsessing universe is
to have things that individuals or
groups of individuals will be able to
sort of fight over and then once you
have it you gotta try to keep it
basically
and speaking to the HUD the HUD is one
of the to me one of the coolest aspects
of the actual space combat of course you
have the helmet that you put on when you
start out that everyone was chanting for
ya in the how about HUD for infantry
what you will it so if you're wearing it
if you're wearing a suit and you got a
fall like combo to your space suit then
you'll have a HUD and depending on it is
so like the the Battle suits would have
HUD information that would basically
link up to your smart weapons whereas
maybe you just had a normal space suit
you wouldn't have all the same features
but it's all sort of men it'd be sort of
in world immersion so you don't get a
HUD unless you were wearing a helmet and
assuming something that would happen
thank you just running around without a
limit or anything on and got a pistol
then you just see a pistol and you have
to kind of eyeball while you're going to
shoot then your best how about sensors
and radars for infantry well we we have
we have sort of personal radar and
sensors they have same of the same
scamming classes that we have for the
big ship so so so you know we have
different types of radar we have heat
you know sort of what you would call
reflective and and II sort of EMF right
so those are all different kinds of
radars that the ships can have and then
you can shield against them in different
ways or hide behind asteroids or
whatever and so we have sort of smaller
versions of that for the the actual
playgroup they use the same so it's the
same kind of radar system that we have a
lot of sounds like as with most things
we've talked to star citizen so far a
lot of back and forth between
counters and yes yeah no no there's a
bit that so a lot of the design is
thinking about like exactly that kind of
stuff so a lot of options and there's
always like there's always you know rock
paper scissors on a lot of stuff so what
I'm hoping is because you know the game
because it's in this sort of persistent
universe and it's not the Wing Commander
style where you're going to be you know
you could just go wave after wave after
karate and blow them up and they were
relatively compared to you we're kind of
weak and this you're not you're going to
be playing against other players or
other NPCs that are much more equivalent
to you so you can't have the same sort
of style of combat where you can just
blow 20 people up in one go and feel
like a badass so now it's going to be
more you know I'm almost once a chess
match but you know like when you get
into a dogfight there's definitely a
sense of like how you manage your
weapons how you manage your energy kind
of some flight tricks you too so it
won't be something that is just like
Gallants austell bam bam they're blown
up I mean there's it's definitely so
back and forth and we're trying to aim
to do that with everything so there's
you know so there's there's a lot of
thinking about it I kind of think I
think you know done right it could be
really really good and speaking about
the dog fighting unveil you mentioned
that player account is still being
tested that's what the office for yeah
yeah oh yeah so no we've I mean we
played I've gone up to about 11 people
before we had some instability but on
sort of a network bandwidth hasn't been
optimized so there's a lot of data going
back and forth has had a few things I
have to go in our cloud stuff isn't
stable yet so all of those things have
to be worked on so kind of we definitely
know that you know eight players are not
a problem but obviously want a lot more
than that so the goal with what we're
doing over the alpha is we're getting it
out there and then we'll be refining and
honing and optimizing and getting going
better to try and see quite how many
players we can get
in one instance at one time and then
with the later sort of v2 drop with the
multi crew chips you know that's folding
them in and that's that's a whole
different level of multiplayer because
it's deal it's different you deal
differently with the players aboard a
ship than you do say when they're in
space so that will probably allow us to
have a few more players on because
spaceships themselves have a lot of data
associated with them anyone spaceship is
already got 50 to 60 like systems
already attached to them and you know
currently right now they're all been
synchronized over the network and so
we're looking at some ways to optimize
that but yet the whole point of the sort
of dog fighting module is to to work on
that so by the time we get closer to the
final game will pretty much hopefully
have that down and working well and it's
optimized as possible sounds good so if
if you want to check out more about star
citizen you can go to robert space
industries com yep exactly and still
accepting backing yeah I know we're
making a really big expensive game so we
got a lot of money so far but I mean
every dollar goes to making the game
even bigger in coolers approaching 42
million or have you surpassed no I don't
think we were surpassed I think word for
I haven't looked at what is recently but
i think it's i think it's like 42 and i
know maybe a half or something yeah i
mean fo sorry 41 and a half saree not 42
42 is a stretch go where everyone gets a
foul what's a million dollars between
friends yeah so check out gamers Nexus
tonight links in the description below
if you want to read more about this in
full article form we all have more
videos of course and check out the
dogfighting module which was looked at
on Thursday and we will see you all next
time peace see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
