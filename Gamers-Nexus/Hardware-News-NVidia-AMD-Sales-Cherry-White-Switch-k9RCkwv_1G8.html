donna and this is your weekly hardware
news recap for the week of the 13th
november 13th so looking back a couple
days here and the first news item for
this recap is JP ours report John petty
research a report on the GPU shipment
and sales volume for quarter three over
quarter too so this first of all was put
out by JP r which is an independent firm
and sometimes JP RS numbers will differ
from AMD and NVIDIA official numbers
this for many reasons one is access to
data another is the definition of GPUs
so with that stated we can look at some
of the stats reported by JP r and this
report does include I GPS and AP use
within the definition of GPU so that
noted AMD saw a fifteen percent growth
in its apu shipment volume in quarter
three over quarter two and nvidia saw a
growth in its laptop shipment volume by
about fourteen percent overall though
laptops are down for the year in terms
of pure volume shipped the GPUs for
desktops were the shining star within
the market with the gaming segment
specifically holding everyone up no huge
surprise there given the power of igps
these days and videos volume grew
twenty-one percent year-over-year for
GPU shipments in quarter three this year
and AMD grew sixteen percent for quarter
three versus quarter two metrics quarter
to was pretty down this year especially
for AMD so Andy saw a massive surge in
shipment volume going thirty three
percent higher than quarter 2 which is
good news for them because that's a
pretty big growth especially with their
apu shipment which is calculated in
there of fifteen percent growth in
quarter three the year-over-year metrics
in total show GPUs declining by about
eight percent because this is looking at
the whole market not just gamers but jpr
did say that the gaming segment is sort
of the shining star in the market and
the part where GPU shipments are really
excelling which again no big surprise to
us computer hardware and home computing
giant asus announced on its earnings
call through CEO Jerry
that the company will be focusing on its
own pair of augmented reality glasses
targeting a release of 2016 and this is
following some discussion on the option
of virtual or augmented reality glasses
for the last couple months in our year
even and ACS is finally committed to the
idea of producing their own pair of AR
glasses AR of course I'm sure many of
you know but just to catch our one up AR
means that you put it on and it
basically adds a UI or graphics or 3d
implanted graphics from processing and
externally into the real world so it's
much different from VR where you put it
on and you can no longer see what's
around you you're completely immersed in
a 3d environment so AR is a bit
different in that regard and for that
reason AR is sometimes a little bit less
associated with the sort of high-octane
3d gaming that you'll find associated
with oculus rift or valves HTC vive
cooperation but for asus they have a
very large home electronics market and
you can look at the zenfone and others
end product lines for that and this fits
into that market pretty well asus the
CEO Jerry Shen did say that AR provides
some value outside of things like just
gaming so specifically you look at
things like planning and layouts and
virtualization of shopping fronts and
things like that so AR is of interest to
aces for that reason and that's why
they're working on the glasses it is
unclear right now if this will be in
cooperation at all with Microsoft's
hollow lens but the inspiration is very
clear a quick news item from the front
of Epic Games and NVIDIA and Vidya just
added its game works Virtual Reality set
up to Unreal Engine 4 so now Unreal
Engine 4 will support sli setups and
multiresolution shading along with other
VR technologies supported through game
works which is Nvidia's proprietary
suite of software development enabling
tools so that is all now with in Unreal
Engine which is the Epic Games engine in
competition with CryEngine and unity in
the world of mechanical keyboards
Harry just announced its new MX nature
white switch which has an actuation
force of 55 Center Newton's so that
lands it somewhere between amex black
and MX red switches and the MX nature
whites which is a linear switch you can
read some of our keyboard reviews and
guides or what that exactly means and
this switch will be a timed exclusive
for ducky ducky is a keyboard
manufacturer they sometimes supply
keyboards to other manufacturers for
example NZXT produced a ducky shine
keyboard not too long ago but they were
limited in volume and that was
effectively rebranded docking keyboard
so the nature whites which will be timed
with the shine 5 duckies new keyboard
coming out in the near future and it
will be exclusive to ducky for that
launch before expanding outward this is
similar to things that Corsair has done
in the past including their Corsair RGB
switches using cherries RGB switch and
that was an exclusive decor sir for
about a year it is now open to market
and coarser has continued their chariot
partnership with exclusive MX silent
switches that they have exclusivity on
for the next six months or so and are
found in the strafe RGB MX silent
version of their keyboards speaking of
Corsair the company announced its new
version of the HG 10 video card aio
liquid cooling bracket and this is the
same as the HG 10 previously just
adapted for modern video cards including
the Titan X 980 TI 9 80 and 970 GPUs and
these mount to reference board designs
reference PCB designs and then support a
effectively sort of socketed aio so you
can use a Sutekh a iOS and then there's
a vrm cooler using the reference a
blower fan the cool the vrm and v ram
modules with the GPU itself being cooled
by liquid so you buy the liquid aio the
CLC separately and mount it to the GPU
using the HG 10 bracket this was
introduced a little while ago maybe a
year or two ago now when NZXT brought
its g10 kraken bracket to the market and
cooler master introduced its HG 10 in
pursuit of NZXT s launch so this new
bracket the HT 10 is
as the N 9 80 and n 9 70 and so forth
and you can find those for the supported
new video cards out on the market
currently so that is this week's
hardware news recap you can find more in
the link in the description below if
you're curious about other hardware and
gaming news the game news recap went up
yesterday and that covers spoiler alert
a lot of fallout a lot of battle front
and a lot of black ops 3 so that's all
out there and check the patreon page in
