net and today we are talking about ddr4
specifically the anticipated switchover
date from ddr3 to ddr4 in other words
the period of expected mass market
adoption of the new memory platform this
is the discussion that was originally
had during the ddr2 ddr3 switchover days
that would have been from the period of
2007-2010 that would be the launch area
until the period at which ddr3 was
massively consumed by even gamers who
are generally among the last adopters
when considering the weight and demands
of the enterprise and server market so
gamers as many of us as there are out
there we are not a huge part of the
market when it comes to new technology
it's always going to be the server
companies that do things first
especially when you look at companies
like google and cisco and all these
people who need very high-powered
systems to sustain their daily
operations and they will make a switch
to new hardware even for things like
energy conservation even if the
bandwidth remains the same because it
can cut costs massively by integrating
this hardware across all of their many
many servers and that brings us to a few
of the key features for ddr4 ddr4 has
energy consumption of about thirty five
percent lower than ddr3l and about ten
percent lower than ddr3 it's also got
almost one hundred percent more
bandwidth than ddr3 and on the server
side there's significantly better error
detection better ECC which maintains
accuracy for a longer period of time and
it's not really something that will see
used in gaming applications but it is an
important factor in ddr4 this does mean
that the benefits for ddr4 are limited
for gaming because currently we're
barely even using ddr3 beyond 1600
megahertz and games if you put a 2400
megahertz stick n you put a 1600
megahertz stick in you're not going to
see huge gains in gaming performance you
will see gains in production
environments like rendering and
streaming and things like that and live
previews of adobe after effects for
example but
not really in gaming maybe an F maybe a
frame per second at best and that is
within margin of error but some games do
make use of faster memory like f1 2012
but we won't get into that here the main
reason ddr4 is immediately slowed to the
market is because there's only one
platform right now for consumers it's
just x99 that's it and that is very
expensive so we're sort of waiting on
intel and AMD to introduce more
platforms that are more reasonably
priced for the rest of us that support
ddr4 and those are coming soon actually
they are coming next year 2015 and into
2016 haswell-e x will support ddr4 broad
well II will sport for Broadwell EP and
even skylake will support either ddr3 or
ddr4 depending on the manufacturer and
the type of skylake platform being built
so the platforms are coming they are on
the way and new platforms really aren't
the only reason that ddr4 has slow
uptake it also comes to things like the
semiconductor manufacturers the
suppliers there kingston corsair g.skill
all these companies they go to just
three semiconductor producers in the
industry they have three people they can
go to and order ram modules for their
sticks of ram that you buy so that means
that there's going to be potentially a
threat of an oligopoly where you have
controlled prices but that's that's
always that is not new for the memory
industry put it that way and we are
waiting for these companies to switch
over there fab process to 25 nanometer
wafer fabrication and that can take a
while because they're currently
producing memory for ddr3 ddr4 the
producing memory for phones for tablets
for laptops which now take different
types of memory than desktops they have
lower voltage memory making it for
desktops of course and this is not these
factors didn't necessarily exist from
ddr2 23 because a lot of these devices
weren't really being consumed on such a
huge scale as they are today especially
phones which are eating into a lot of
the wafer put
and and fabrication of these memory dies
these memory modules so that is
definitely delaying the uptake on ddr4
now to answer the question of the video
when will ddr3 switch over to ddr4 on
mass for even those of us just gaming it
is looking like that will happen in 2016
that can change obviously depending on
how the three suppliers end up doing
with their their supply and demand and
if they have shortages or if they try to
control things a bit more than they
should and get greedy but it's looking
like 2016 and we've spoken to a few
memory manufacturers about this and they
all seem to agree that sometime in the
twenty fifteen to twenty seventeen range
there will be a switchover on mass for
consumers including and especially
gamers so that is it for this video if

subscribe it helps a lot and keeping the
channel going we're doing really well
lately and I appreciate all of your
support please leave a comment below if
you have any suggestions or questions
