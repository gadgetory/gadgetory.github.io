sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill ladies and gentlemen we're
g.skill let me give you a table of
contents what I'm about to talk about
g.skill peripherals we got new keyboards
we also have some new power supplies as
a power supplies peripheral no it's not
but who cares I'm also going to talk
about memory we're also going to let you
guys choose what new Mouse g.skill
should make in a different color and
flavor if I'm going to show you the
overclocking world stage while they're
doing tons of overclocking alright back
to the first thing I said this is the km
770 RGB it is an RGB mechanical keyboard
as the RGB should imply RGB seems to be
very popular here at Computex this year
we've already seen this in the km 780
trim which is actually right up here
above it became 7080 has this like an
additional bar that goes around the
outside they based got some additional
materials it also comes with accessories
such as the key cap set this does not
which means it's going to be less
expensive
they've also sort of streamlined the
wrist rest to make a little bit more
comfortable and one of my complaints
with the game 780 was at this top row of
media function keys was not RGB it lit
up in all red they've changed that so
now the media function keys do light up
in all red the volume button is not but
we are told that they're working on a
firmware update so you'll be able to
disable that if you don't want to see
the red on there everything else is all
RGB though which is how things should be
as we know as now you get all the same
features of the km 780 including a USB
pass-through as well as a mic and
headphone pass-through which is pretty
nice this keyboard has been doing really
well but this km 770 is going to be a
little bit cheaper GCL is not quite
ready to provide us a actual sale price
but we're expecting this to be available
in q3 which is coming up really soon
here's another new keyboard from g.skill
the km 570 MX this is a much simpler
design pretty straightforward you know
it's a keyboard right but what they're
doing here is giving you a more
affordable variety of the Cherry MX
enabled full 108 key keyboard
Cherry MX switches we're going to sit
we're told that it's going to be
available in blues Browns as well as
Reds that's got a dedicated volume
control doesn't have a lot of the extra
features of the km 770 but again it's
going to be in at a much more compelling
price point $99.99 that's pretty
it for a full Cherry MX mechanical
keyboard as for availability on this one
we're expecting it worldwide and abouts
q4 but it'll be available in China
before then so if you live in China and
get that early power supplies this is
the g.skill ripjaws series of power
supplies the are they're available in 80
plus gold as well as 80 + platinum
varieties look look how heavy it is you
can't see how heavy this is
that's nothing makes sense anyway
they're fully modular though platinum of
course on this one hits the Platinum
design on the side looks pretty nice
straightforward power supplies are
actually being developed by a couple
different OEMs so hence the difference
logos and branding on this one PS 1200 P
PS 1250 P so 1250 watts 1200 watts Danny
we also have an 850 watt version which
is also fully modular course these are
all fully modular and then finally we
have the 850 available in gold and you
know gold is nearly as good as platinum
and it usually cost a little bit less
very nice power supplies and now for
some memory we're specifically talking
about tried NZ memory which I've
actually been asked about a lot since I
used some in my 69 50 X benchmarks video
what I was asked was when is this going
to be frickin available well guess what
like next week probably on new egg first
and then available a lot more widely
after that since G still usually does
some exclusive with new eggs off the bat
we're right over here gots an orange
variety this is a 32 hundred megahertz
kit kats latency of 13 that's really
fast and it's a 64 gig kit this was
significant because they're doing 16 gig
dims we did not see the speed in 16 gig
dims up until this year we only had 8
gig dims before same thing goes on over
here 41:33 kit this one is the actual
color scheme that we've already seen G
skills of course expanded this so they
have sort of a silver a black and then
they have different top bar cross plates
they can put across those this one has a
casa latency of 19 but 41 33 megahertz
speed quite fast moving up the line we
have 40 to 66 memory just gets the more
left you go the faster the memory gets
this one also is using the standard
color scheme that we saw before Casa
latency of nineteen one point 4 volts
and again eight gig dims but that's
really fast memory 4266
speaking really fast memory how about
the fastest memory kit that they have at
Computex that's this one right here
look it's yellow and black
like the own black it looks pretty cool
I kinda want to make a yellow and black
build now there's not where to get one
piece of hardware there's a specific
color scheme and then I want to build a
whole computer around it I've done it
before
anyway forty five hundred megahertz
castle NC 16 and these are eight gig
dims as well this is just a bye to kit
that we're looking at right here in this
z170 OC formula from asrock but that's
some scream and fast memory now what
would you want to do is scream and best
memory you don't put it into a very fast
system of course here's another very
fast system this last kit on this line
34 66 64 gig dims cast latency a port
keen on this one that's some tight tight
timings man tight but uh let's let's
talk practicality shall we really fast
memory
let's do for you a little frame or two
in games you know it's kind of exciting
but a really good implementation of
really fast memory is actually going to
be for something that uses an integrated
GPU and I GPU because the I GPUs often
share the memory speed or the actually
shared memory for the GPU you guys give
no one to talk about so that's why we
have this kit right here ddr4 2033 33
this is a 32 gig kit 16 gig dims by 2
and these RSO dims which is why they
have it in this little Intel skull tray
look down there powering this little
system and we don't have direct
benchmark story but we're told boost in
your nook or say a gaming laptop with
these dims is going to greatly improve
the performance of the eye GPU and that
is useful alright I'm breaking the rules
now I'm inside the lines I might be
trapped here forever but let's talk X 99
X 99 gives you ddr4 memory quad channel
which is better than dual channel and
you of course get eight dim slot so that
means you can get some insane memory
configurations like a sudden 28 gig kit
that they have here this again is the
yellow and black aesthetic ddr4 3300 1.3
5 volt cast latency 16 I need 128 gig
memory kid
why Ram disk man I'm gonna make a ram
disk I make a really big Ram disk 128
gig kit here's another hundred 20 a cake
kit casa latency a 14 on this one how's
that possible they made it tighter well
the speed isn't quite as much 3200 but
tighter timings this one again is the
oh no this is kind of a different color
scheme it's that sort of slate gray with
the red on top that's pretty sexy moving
up the line we have a ddr4 3600 kit this
is a 64 gig kit so they're using 8 gig
dims this one has a gray and white
crossbar and actually it's in an Asus
x99 deluxe - which I have and I think I
need this memory because it matches so
perfectly with that motherboard these
are all using of course Broadwell
processors so this is a 6800 K that was
a I was a 69 hundred K over there this
is a 69 50 X right here the Big Daddy
this is sort of that darker gray with
the white cross bar kit right here
thirty-six hundred megahertz 64 gig kit
eight gig by 8 gig by 8 games that makes
sense and a cast latency of 15 moving up
the line more Triton Z again with a
lighter grey in the white crossbar this
one says a gigabyte designator
motherboard that also matches quite
nicely hundred twenty eight K kit 3466
speed with 16 gig dims castling Z 16
there's so many varieties here just if
you if you want speed if you want
timings you can do either one I don't
know what do you prefer speed or timings
I like both finally we have one more kit
down here this is a 3466 speed kit
hundred and twenty eight gigs again
sixteen gig by eight dims casa latency
sixteen it's paired up with the 69 50 X
and this one sitting in annex 99 a
god-like gaming carbon motherboard which
is sexy I have one of these at home too
I have too many X 99 motherboards I've
just realised that that's kind of that's
not a bad problem to have anyway so
that's all the memory that they have on
display here I know it's a lot but I
have a question for you guys and I'm
going to check out the overclocking
world's record stage guys here's where
we need a little bit of help from Yugi
skill has their MX 780 Mouse it's got an
8200 dpi gaming great Avago sensor I
love the logo sensors they track so
nicely a programmable buttons for zone
for zone customisable RGB lighting and
look this is a white version so this has
white was sort of a black on the inset
there and then of course the lighting
that looks pretty nice I like the white
version basically g.skill is going to be
doing is they're going to be doing two
of these new
but they have four versions here so we
got the white with the black here is the
more traditional black and then it sort
of got red on the inside there granted
the lighting that we're looking at right
here is a little bit off so please bear
that in mind
above that we also have a white version
with a blue sort of inner inner cage
right there that looks pretty nice not
too bad at all
and then finally up at the top here in
the dark and five up here we have white
was sort of more of a teal or perhaps
aqua incent which sort of has a light
and carefree look I think that's kind of
Pleasant though so anyway guys I'm going
to post a link down in the video
description and and g.skill is basically
asking people to go to their Facebook
page and vote vote how much of these
they like the best and whichever to win
they will actually produce let's round
out our coverage of the g.skill both
here at the g.skill OC world record
stage where they typically invite
overclockers from around the world at
Computex every year because there's
always new hardware to come and
basically overclock the crap out of it
so up here we got 69 50 X's and they're
also working with GTX 1080s and we had
the chance to check out Vince aka
kingpin setup which is actually pretty
insane now he's been doing overclocking
for quite a while he holds the 3d mark
world record right now for four-way SLI
and you know he basically said he wanted
to do something new so I'm a little
different so basically he has a mortal
kombat like arcade stick setup thing
those are wired into some valves which
are connected up to these Matt Savelle
and two tanks lnto tanks are pressurized
so basically he can simply push a button
to open up the valve and send the ln2
into the pot to cool down of course GPU
or the CPU this is not just because it's
fun to push a button to do this it does
make it a little bit simpler but it also
according to him helps conserve about
30% of the ln2 they use and depending
where you are else who could be pretty
damn expensive so it's both practical
and fun I also just like watching this
type of overclocking in general because
it's it's that there's loud noises
there's like valve 'add the smoke that
flies around everywhere it's very
visually appealing
I talked to Vince about his overclocks
on his 69 50 X he said it was getting up
to about 5.2 or 5.3 across 10 cores
which is half
zuly monstrous for a chip like that
asked about the 1082
he didn't give me some numbers for that
I kept feeling he's actually not quite
satisfied with where he's getting to
this point still waiting for maybe some
voltage unlocking or maybe inset nvidia
to sort of open up that chip for maximum
overclocks anyway though guys that is
going to wrap it up for g.skill coverage
here from Computex 2016 I'd like to say
a big thank you to my sponsors g.skill
of course as well as fractal design and
MSI guys if you enjoy this coverage from
