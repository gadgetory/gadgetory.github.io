show you guys how tidy I kept to my
hotel room during my Computex trip got
the camera gear over there
the workstation set up over there I
actually have a dirty clothes bag keep
my dirty clothes anyway I am currently
prepping for the final day going over to
the exhibition center so I've got my
camera rig set up got my backpack I am
good to go
I've actually been coming to Computex
for six years now my first year was in
2013 it is now 2018 I really love it
here I love coming to Taiwan Taipei is
an awesome city and get anything you
wanted just about any time of day
got the iconic Taipei 101 up there above
everything and it's usually just great
but I know what it is for some reason
the show this year just seems not quite
as exciting as usual maybe it's because
there's not very many GPU launches maybe
it's because the CPU launches have been
either specialty products or just really
high core counts ion desktop stuff that
most people aren't even gonna have
access to so this has kind of got me
thinking not just about the good part of
coming to Taipei Taiwan and visiting
Computex which I still intend to do and
I still love it here but also that there
are some downsides as well so here are
three things I hate about copy discs so
for starters let's head back outside the
first thing I hate is the weather it's
somewhat well known fact the Computex is
intentionally scheduled in the summer
when typhoon season is about to begin
so the temperatures here in Fahrenheit
are usually in the low 90s but the
humidity is just crazy high so if you're
lucky you might get a little bit of
cloud cover like we have today when the
Sun does come out it's absolutely
intense anyone from North America who
has visited anywhere closer to the
equator has probably experienced that Oh
God guys guy
skin is becoming white-hot the heat a
quick test here I'm gonna walk from one
end of the front of the Convention
Center here together and see how I do
I should also clarify there like I'm not
blaming anyone here for the weather it
gets hot here this there's no way around
that it's just something you got a deal
with something you gotta be prepared for
i recommend bringing a couple sets of
shirts for every day shower as often as
possible take breaks in air-conditioned
areas if you have the opportunity
a ray of Sun is split this rock
completely in half God hey my baby over
here I'm perspiring armpits are sweaty
it's also why I'm wearing a black shirt
so you can't see that even though I come
here at the worst time of year to travel
here it's probably not doing any favors
through my audio let's head inside air
conditioning that's a wonderful
invention the second thing I hate about
Computex is loud boots I don't know what
is the reason I guess it's because it
draws attention but there's certain boos
the set up a stage have an announcer
last loud music it's just it's way too
loud it's a it's like insanely loud you
can't even talk to anyone if you're
trying to have a conversation and the
particular for trying to make a video
like why bother trying to capture audio
because there's just some booth that's
gonna start playing music and have a
bunch of girls come out dancing more on
the girls in a second
can't even hear anything it's not just
the dancing shows that though they might
be doing other stuff that's way too loud
career and so tech
prior to so it's just signature with a
great pic at the moment or a betta he's
trying to drag his team to the victory
the fact that he goes hunting for that
rotation for its I love the fact that he
ends with a couple shots to the cork so
jake has kind of a double wedding going
on they got a stage back here with some
SG getting going
the stage over there was lady talking
another loudspeaker very easy to follow
see now that's how you attract people to
your booth free beer
so top competitors for loudest booth
this year seem to be v color G skill
and they're right next to each other so
they just battle it out all day though
Tech definitely coming in there as well
so here's my thoughts on that the louder
and more like look at me your booth is
the less I want to go there and look at
seven
now the third thing I hate about copy
text is a little difficult to explain
but in the second thing you might have
noticed quite a few ladies some of them
may be scantily clad position that moves
and they're there basically to attract
people over
commonly known as booth babes models I
don't hate them they're making money
they're here to do a job and to some
extent we have seen less and less of
that at CES over on the US side but
still pretty prevalent here at Computex
what I do hate though is that there's
dudes who come here with fancy cameras
and from what I can tell they care
nothing about the technology no they are
here for free models because they can
just go up to the models the models have
no choice but to stand there and hold
the product and these guys basically
come and get free modeling and they go
around and do nothing to take pictures
of the models I hate it I think it sucks
makes me feel dirty so I'm gonna see if
I can flip the script on some of these
guys
can I behold
take your picture you know I your face
okay here goes anybody else
okay
thank you and all right so I'll give you
a pose smile
my attempts to pop the paparazzi we're
only moderately successful but I still
had fun I don't always do videos like
this was sort of a negative slant to
them but let me know what you guys
actually think I think the only thing
that I found a little bit more
depressing than the things that I hates
the three things is the fact that
especially the booth babes and the loud
noises managed to get so many crowds
actually gathered around those booths so
I guess people are gonna keep doing them
while they're still affected that's all
the time I have for this video guys
don't forget to hit the thumbs up button
and subscribe because I do have one more
Computex video still to come thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
