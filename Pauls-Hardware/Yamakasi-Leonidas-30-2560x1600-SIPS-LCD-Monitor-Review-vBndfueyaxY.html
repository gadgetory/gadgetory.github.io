hardware thanks for tuning in today I
have a review for you guys this is my
new monitor this is the yamakasi
leonidas 2560 by 1600 monitor all the
way from Korea I've had it for about a
week now so I'm going to be doing an
unboxing as well as a review if you're
wondering how I'm going to be doing an
unboxing I'm gonna do it by traveling
back in time actually I'm just gonna
reference the video I shot last week
when I unboxed it so to start off here's
a look at the retail box in the
condition that it arrived to me and as
you can see it's packed very very well
they've done actual bubble wrap over the
entire outside of the retail box and I'm
going to give it a quick a quick size
comparison here with nori she's not
really into it okay maybe we'll check
him later but as you can see totally
fine as far as shipping it arrived to me
in about like four days I think after I
placed the order and that was during
Korean New Year which was pretty
impressive as you can see just a little
bit of scuffing on the side but again
with that bubble wrap that the box
itself was almost perfect there was one
little thing in it that I think you'll
see here in a second hey there it is
right there little thing in the box
again nothing to worry about the monitor
itself is totally fine so as far as
shipping goes totally perfect also as
far as duties or imports or anything
like that I'm in the US in California
and I had to pay nothing extra anyway
there's the box itself
bubble wrap off as you can see I'm
Ecosse 300 leonidas it's actually pretty
hilarious the amount of copyright
infringement going on here with the 300
team I'm sure if they actually imported
it they might actually have to change
the name of the monitor maybe or at
least the box I have no idea anyway is
just some looks at the outside of the
box this is made by wheat tech or Y Tech
here's another here's another dog size
comparison see I know you anyway the
here is the Box being opened of course
inside we have a baggie with all the
accessories we also have the monitor
itself really nice closed cell foam
packaging another extra piece below
there to protect the screen just in case
anything did punch through as you can
see it's really well protected so
I wasn't really concerned at all as far
as the monitor here's a look at the
inner packaging of course and that's
pretty much it it was in beautiful
condition I did pay for the
pixel-perfect version so there was no
dead pixels I should also mention here
is the accessories it comes with a dual
link DVI cable and bear mind you need
dual link DVI in order to use this
monitor you also get the AC adapter and
it's got kind of some funny wording on
there which I thought was was pretty
cute
but pretty standard power brick there
were some complaints about this getting
too warm in my experience it hasn't I
mean it does get warm but nothing more
than a power brick I've seen as you can
see standard AC adapter type cable 110
volt is acceptable so this is a cable
that comes with which I think is Korean
or your I honestly have no idea what
kind of plug that is I'm sorry but you
don't need to use that it comes with an
AC adapter if you're in the u.s. to go
with the u.s. standard sized plug that
you can pop on but I just used an
existing computer cable I had and that
works just fine here's the user's manual
it's all in Korean
they'll send you an English version if
you really want an English version via
PDF and they eat in the mail and then
here's an extra English bit that was
thrown in I believe this was actually
thrown in by the eBay shipper green some
that I got from but as you can see some
troubleshooting as well as installing
the power cable and whatnot so you
should pretty much be able to get set up
and good to go without any difficulties
so here's a look at the monitor itself
and as you can see well it's pretty nice
and I wanted to point out a couple
different things specifically one of the
reasons one of the things I wanted to
point out is why why I decided to get
this monitor basically right now if you
want a 2560 by 1600 monitor your options
are to pay a little over a thousand
dollars for one of the ones that's
currently available retail in the US and
there's quite a few options out there
and they're very nice as you would
expect if you're paying a thousand bucks
for a monitor there I've tried several
of those but I wanted 2560 by 1600 and
there's also the yama kasi cat leap
that's very popular out there that's
2560 by 1440 I wanted the high
resolution
because I've been using that but I've
been running benchmarks and I've really
kind of fallen in love with that
resolution it just looks so nice I miss
the vertical space I am just trans yeah
I miss the vertical space when it's not
there anymore
and I wanted something that I could use
at home especially since I've been doing
more benchmarking and stuff at home so
looking online is a there's a yama kasi
sparta you might see that's available
and you can actually get that for about
five to six hundred bucks depending on
where you look I didn't go with the
Sparta for a couple reasons one is that
the Sparta has a different housing than
this and if you can see here this is a
really nice all-metal brush metal
housing that's kind of grey on the back
so you guys can see from the side here
that's about the width of it I also
wanted a slightly better stand and this
does have definitely a much better stand
than the cat leap or the Sparta as you
can see it's got height tilt and swivel
so you can swivel the monitor the stand
is actually a little bit on the flimsy
side for my taste but I mean it's hard
to complain I guess too much because
honestly once I get a monitor set up
where I want it to go that's usually
about the last time I move it unless I
do a video on it like this one but it
comes with a little pin in the bottom
which are totally misplaced this little
pin here on the bottom it just screws in
right down here when it's in its lowest
position so you can lock it in place
there other than that once you remove
that you pretty much have free range to
do the height that's about as high as it
goes about as little as it goes on that
stand the stand is pretty basic it is
black it's got a bit of gloss on the
bottom that's already started to get a
little scuffed up as is glossy monitors
Dan's tend to do but the other thing I
like about this monitor so far is the
temperature actually because I do have
an thirty 2560 by 1600 at work that's in
HP's er 30 W I believe and one thing
I've noticed is is what the backlight it
gets really warm and it starts to just
put off all this heat this monitor does
get warm but I don't know whether it's
the metal housing or just the components
inside maybe a little bit newer maybe a
little bit more efficient no idea but
barely coming off of the back of this
you can tell if you put your hand right
up there with it with the HP sometimes
I'm sitting in front of it actually
notice but this one that's been totally
fine it tilts as you can see it tilts
back pretty far I bet at all if that's
your thing and then here as you can see
we have our controls controls are pretty
basic you get power and then there's a
plus and minus and I all have
practically no idea what the plus and
minus do all right guys here's another
shot
with the monitor actually on this is
just running the Unigine valley
benchmark and I know this is really
subjective because you are watching this
on your monitor and you can't
necessarily see the quality of this
monitor but I can tell you this is a it
looks beautiful oh I can also hear it oh
that's because I have I have headphones
plugged in I forgot I had headphones
plugged in and I hadn't been listening
to the audio on this benchmark yet but
again I got the pixel-perfect version so
that is one issue if you are looking on
the eBay sales for this particular
monitor actually most of the monitors
they have a policy for the center you
can have one dead pixel and then up to
four more in the areas around the outer
edges and pretty much I just I didn't
want to have that one or two or three
dead pixels that I had could do nothing
about I really wanted it to be a perfect
panel so I paid about an extra 80 or
hundred bucks for the perfect pixel
version so this was ended up being about
750 bucks for 650 you can get this not
pixel perfect if you're willing to take
a little bit of a risk and I read a lot
of people get them and theirs they're
just fine they're just as fine as the
pixel perfect versions and then as I was
taught to mention it earlier you also
have the Sparta option Sparta has a
tempered glass panel on on the front so
it's actually a glossy screen I
absolutely despise glossy screens so I
wanted this one to be the nice matte
finish that you can probably see that it
is and yeah that pretty much does it so
reason with this even though like a good
two or three hundred more then I could
have gotten the Sparta 4 which is the
same 2560 by 1600 and essentially the
same panel behind it was I wanted this
housing I wanted the matte finish
I wanted pixel perfect and the last
thing is I wanted to
have the input on the back that this one
has which is just a single dual link DVI
so I'm going to go into that next so
here as you can see is our single DVI
input also over there on the side you
can see the special little AC power
adapter input now the reason that I
wanted this actually like this with the
single DVI input is input lag because
when you have multiple inputs there's an
actual board in there that can lead to
input lag depending on the type of
monitor you're using of course so there
is the DVI input but one of the big
warnings that you'll see if you're
looking at this monitor online this one
is opposed to the Sparta because the
Sparta has multiple inputs is that if
you're using the dual link DVI you have
to have a dual link DVI connection so
they have video cards that they are
listing off you basically need dual link
DVI 2560 by 100 1600 resolution capable
but what if you have a monitor that has
other what if you have a video card or a
video source that has other outputs so I
want to do a quick test here I brought
along some adapters so this is a
DisplayPort to dual link DVI and this is
an active adapter so I'll be testing
this one out I also have an HDMI to dual
link DVI I believe it's dual link it's
got all the pins in there although HDMI
technically unless you have the really
newest HDMI spec can't do this
resolution and then finally I have
standard sized DisplayPort to D AB dual
link DVI and this is actually kind of
really chintzy little adapter then I'm
not even sure if it works but I'm just
going to try it out because this is a
passive an adapter as opposed to this
one which is active so let's see if any
of these will give me a signal on this
monitor that's a negative native
ghostwriting
okay test number one with our
DisplayPort to DVI passive adapter was
an utter failure this is test number two
we're going with the HDMI to DVI adapter
I've also switched over video cards the
first test that's running with an Ares 2
which has a native full sized
DisplayPort this is a HS Radeon HD 7970
gigahertz Edition which has an HDMI out
and is not looking good so far
and I think that's a swing and a miss
for the HDMI to DVI adapter so for two
so far with our passive adapters here is
test number three if I was going to pick
a horse for this race this would have
been it this is the mini DisplayPort to
DVI active adapter let's see if she
works Wow well I gotta admit kind of a
surprising result guys uh they're not
they're not joking around when they say
you need a dual link DVI connection and
it needs to be native don't plan on
using adapters because I've tried at
least three different options here all
three did not work so again dual link
DVI required for this monitor and that
wraps it up for this video guys once
again this has been my review of the
yamakasi
Leonidas 2560 by 1600 only available
right now on ebay so you got to take a
little bit of risk when you're ordering
this one but if you go the route that I
did I think you'll be very happy once
again
superb monitor fantastic panel beautiful
beautiful color reproduction I only
really complained thus far about it has
been the stand which is slightly flimsy
but honestly really not that big of a
deal and then of course again that
backlight which is really bright right
now the one thing I haven't done yet is
do some calibration on it again there's
really no controls on the monitor itself
so you got to do that from within
Windows I'm going to grab a calibration
tool that we have work and play around
with it and see what kind of results I
can get but again that's all for this
video if you guys enjoyed please toss a
like my way I'd love you if you would
subscribe for more tech videos just like
this one
