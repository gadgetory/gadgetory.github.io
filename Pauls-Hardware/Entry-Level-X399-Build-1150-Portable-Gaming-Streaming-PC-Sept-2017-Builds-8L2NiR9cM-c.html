how's it going everybody and welcome
back to Pauls hardware this is my
monthly builds video for September 2017
this is a monthly series that I do every
month that make sense and I go over a
couple parts list for computer builds to
give you guys suggestions if you're
looking to part out a system yourself
and you're looking for a little bit of
help now if you want to see an actual
construction of a build
check out my builds playlist and I will
fully admit that I have not been
following up properly for the past like
month and a half on my monthly builds
videos usually I take one of the
buildings that I part out and build it
during the month and then test it later
on in the month but due to lots of
different factors I've actually not
followed up well so my apologies for
that and I'm gonna be trying to catch up
this month I actually have a couple
builds at least planned but of course we
need your feedback as well so check out
the strawpoll length in the description
if you don't let me know what builds you
want to see in October and I have a
selection here including a bunch of
super towers because going back to last
month that's what you guys were
interested in and also a scary Halloween
computer and a couple other options
there - since Intel has some stuff that
might be coming out soon although we're
not sure when that's coming out now last
month I gave you guys a multiple choice
option and actually for this month too
you can choose more than one answer on
that survey if you want to but $1,200
gaming PC was the top one here and this
is actually I took this to mean you want
something more expensive so actually
with a bit higher end than $1,200 also
form-factor was super tower ATX and this
took me by surprise
and I was unprepared so this is why for
next month I actually have potentially a
Coolermaster case that I might use for a
super tire build so let me know what you
think about that but beyond that you
guys were interested in many ITX and
then the more expensive price ranges
rather than the less expensive price
ranges that I was asking about so for
this month I have two builds we're going
to
off with this one here which is the
entry-level thread Ripper 1900 X build
which is a very similar build to the one
that I parted out last month however now
we have the 1900 X let's let you get in
on the thread Ripper platform for five
hundred and fifty dollars for the CPU
itself now granted it is an eight-core
sixteen thread CPU which is the same as
you get as the eighteen hundred X on the
main stream platform so if you're
investing in something like this you're
really doing it to get access to the
high-end features of this platform in
general which means upgrading to
potentially a twelve core or a sixteen
core processor in the future also quad
channel memory also 64 PCI Express Lanes
so tons of connectivity for other things
my thread Ripper 9900 X entry level
build is around seventeen hundred and
fifty dollars
17:25 if you look right now and take
into account mail and rebates and that
kind of thing and the idea here is not
to build the cheapest possible thread
Ripper and tr4 platform build weekend
it's to choose parts that are reasonably
priced on the lower end since this entry
level but still reasonable I'm not
pairing this with like a gtx 1050 TI or
something like that and I'm not going
with like a single stick of four gigs of
memory I have the processor I have an
air cooler I have an ass rack
motherboard Corsair full quad channel
kit and memory an SSD attempt gtx 1070
and all that good stuff so starting off
with the processor the AMD risin thread
repair an 1800 X of course $550 bear in
mind that for not too much more money
just about 250 more dollars you can
upgrade to the 12 core version of this
or you can spend $1000 eventually for an
extra 450 and get the 16 core full fat
version of thread Ripper but if you
really want in on this platform and you
don't want to spend all that money or if
you just have great need of extra PCIe
lanes but not necessarily all those
cores then there might be some people
who are interested in this processor
hopefully we'll get one to test out as
well and then we have an air cooler for
it since you can't get liquid coolers
that do slot in with tiara for really
easily but I wanted to stick with air
since it is a little bit cheaper by 10
or 15 bucks even though the Noctua
coolers are fairly expensive this is the
Nhu 12s which they specifically designed
for thread Ripper so I should be taking
a look at one of these pretty soon too
I'm gonna pair this up with the asrock X
399 tight
a txt are for motherboard still one of
the least expensive thread repair
motherboards even though it is 335 ish
dollars this one actually do have on
hand right here ready to go and build
with Asus is the only other motherboard
manufacturer that I could find right now
that has a thread Ripper motherboard
that's in like the 320 to $350 issue
Ange so check that one out too but this
has been out since launch and it's got
some pretty good feedback on it already
and I've been looking forward to doing a
build with it so for memory storage and
video card I've used a parametric filter
on PC part picker which let's use these
filter options here on the left hand
side so I wanted ddr4 I want it's faster
ddr4 because in my opinion if you're
gonna invest in threader 4 or Rison
you're gonna want at least 3,000 speed
memory or something faster so it shows a
few of those options there I chose a 16
gig kit 4 by 4 gigs and then I basically
just sorted it by price and it's
choosing the lowest price option here
which happens to be a Corsair Vengeance
lpx kit for about one hundred and
sixty-five dollars which is man I hope
ddr4 prices come down soon because they
have gone up recently rather than down
and that kind of sucks I did somewhat of
the same thing for storage it's sort
actually sort by price over here however
this time I did a wider range when it
comes to the capacity so capacity here
I'm looking for the 240 ish gig SSDs and
the 500 gig ish SSD so I want 162 525
there and hope you guys can see this
well enough chose SSD of course and then
that was pretty much it there and then
ice again sorted by price here is how
you I'm sorry I didn't serve by price
asserted by price per gigabyte that way
which you can get down below 30 cents
per gigabyte however to do that you need
to buy the 500 gig or 480 game versions
which of course cost not quite twice as
much but almost twice as much the
cheapest 240 gig one is the SanDisk SSD
240 gig that I chose it's 84 dollars and
yes you will need additional storage
beyond that with the motherboard
purchase right now with a new egg you
get a 320 GB SSD but my assumption here
is that you're gonna get a full-sized
mechanical hard drive a 2 terabyte or
something like that and drop it in here
as well maybe you have a used one or
just add one on it cost
usually about 40 to 50 bucks for
something like that video card same
general idea video car prices are pretty
crazy right now still due to
cryptocurrency mining and that kind of
thing so gtx 1070 in my opinion is kind
of the sweet spot when it comes to a
graphics card that you can get for
relatively close to the MSRP still very
powerful so it matches up with this kind
of build without like you know just
skipping out and going for something
that's a hundred or hundred fifty bucks
and you can find them for as little as
three hundred bucks I'm sorry four
hundred bucks right now for the standard
founders Edition one ZOTAC also is a
mini version that you can get for about
four hundred and twenty issue dollars so
the cheapest 1070 you could find is
basically what I was going forward with
this one for the case I went with a
budget case I was looking for a case in
the sixty to seventy dollar range with
graphite series 230 T is a great option
here I was also looking at the cooler
master master box which is a good option
NZXT s340 would be an easy choice here
as well there's lots of really good
options in the 67 th dollar range I
didn't want to go down to the 50 buck
range because you start getting into
some really kind of budget annoyances
down there but the 230 T solid case
comes with fans plenty of ventilation
which I was also keen on and then it's
also got a solid side panel window which
I was also interested in because I'm not
really interested in color coordination
for this build I don't care about the
LEDs I don't care that we have a knock
to a fan with hideous not to a colors in
there all that matters is the
performance and getting yourself a
threader for billed for a reasonably low
price the power supply went slightly
overkill on there's a 650 watt version
of this Corsair CX series the newly
revamped for 2017 with a all-black
aesthetic as well as all black cables
which is super nice thank you Corsair
for providing this option and I went
with the 750 watt version just to give
us a little bit more Headroom for this
entire build since there's so much
expandability options here you want to
have plenty of wattage available to you
so the 750 watt version is what I went
for and even with the it's it's only 55
bucks I mean why would you not it's also
80 plus bronze I also opted to go with
the 80 plus bronze because you can get a
much better deal on a power supply and
well whereas long-term you can save a
few bucks on your power bill by going
with an 80 plus cool there's something
like that
any Plus Browns will get you by get you
something all function and you know it
at least rated well enough for 80 plus
bronze efficiency so there it is my
entry-level theater for 1900 X built
about seventeen hundred and fifty
dollars
definitely not budgets but still
entry-level when it comes to a high-end
desktop platform and you're gonna get a
lot of power for that money too
next up is my super portable gaming PC
this is an AMD build as well although
it's on the mainstream platform with the
rise and five 1600 processor it's about
eleven hundred and fifty dollars it is
portable it is powerful but powerful
powerful it is meant for both gaming as
well as doing workstation stuff since
it's got a six core processor could
handle gaming and streaming as well and
with some add-ons could even be a
capture system as I parted out last
month since this is kind of a rehashing
of the system that I built last month
because what happened was I realized the
system I was going to build last month I
actually wanted to do something with so
I'm doing actually a pay it forward
build for our good friend Rachel who I
don't know if you guys remember but back
when I worked at Newegg and didn't make
TV Rachel was our co-worker there she
did a lot of writing for the yolked show
and that kind of thing so she is
actually going overseas to work for a
while and I don't give too many details
about what she's doing but she needed a
new system she needed an upgrade it's
been quite a while
she games and she does workstation stuff
and she might stream as well so that's
what this is all built around so for the
case we wanted something that was super
portable which is why I wanted to
silverstone case and this is a version
that has a handle that goes on top
although I just haven't mounted that up
yet so I'm going to be providing most of
the components for this build and then
Rachel actually purchased the graphics
card the case and the power supply since
those were the only things that I didn't
have spares of around for her to use all
right so $1,150 here's the rest of the
parts here let's go over them one at a
time really quick starting out to the
Rison 5 1600 processor processor 6 core
processor insanely popular you can get
it for sub $200 right now it will come
with a CPU cooler in the box although
I'm planning on using the cravaack c7
provided the am for mounting kit
actually I'm sorry yeah the c7 provided
the mounting kit arrives in time that's
the only thing I'm I'm still waiting on
Craig is sending me that directly I was
trying to order at other places but this
is a nice low profile cooler I use this
on my HTPC for quite some time does a
really good job and
I think I think I think it'll be a good
choice for this one however does need a
name for upgrade kit which Craig has
this is a part of their website where
they list those as well as the different
coolers that they have and the different
mounting kits that go with them the c7
requires a m4 upgrade kit type C which
they didn't have on nuoc so I couldn't
order it so hopefully that arrives soon
if not we'll go out this that cooler and
and that'll do just fine as well for a
motherboard of course there's only a
couple mini ITX I am for motherboards
that are available this is the a be 350
end gaming Wi-Fi from gigabytes and and
there it is
nice solid compact little motherboard
tons of stuff wedged into it there so
it's gonna be a tight build as lots of
mini ATX builds typically go this is a
solid board for about $115 and of course
got to maintain the mini ATX form factor
I used the same or roughly the same
memory parametric filter option that I
did in the previous build so just went
with a 16 gig kit to buy eight gigs this
time which you can get for a bit less
apparently 130 499 for that so two bite
for the two by eight gigs I don't know
why the 4x4 gig kits there's so much
more expensive but anyway there you go
you get ddr4 3000 for that I'm probably
gonna use a kit I already have on hand
here but this is my solution for you
guys that that need to actually hunt
down some memory to use for an SSD I
have the same SSD because I used the
same method from the first build to find
an SSD and this is the most reasonably
priced 240 gig you know it's a SanDisk
and it's 84 bucks so there you go for a
graphics card I also have this otech
GeForce GTX 1078 geek mini this one was
partially because it is mini and it is a
mini ITX build although this case does
support fairly lengthy graphics cards
the length this is more of a concern
than the width I guess is the thickness
that that's that's anyway point is you
can get this one for about 415 420
dollars
it's rare to find 1070 s that are sub
400 bucks right now but this one should
be a good choice for us it is also
overclocked a little bit I believe and
it's got two big fans on it so since
this case actually does have plenty of
ventilation right there on the side as
well as a filter
for the intake for the graphics card
some of the reviews I haven't used this
case yet but several the review said
that they thought a open-style fan would
work better than a blower style fan in
this case just because it's got that
plenty of airflow and heat buildup in a
Mini ITX system is something that should
be you should be a little bit concerned
about so there's the case the ml 0 8 B -
H the - H means it comes with a handle
attachment that goes up on top just an
extra piece that they put in the Box a
screw on there so that will make it a
little bit more portable
I had told Rachel that she if she's
planning on taking a computer overseas
you should definitely make sure it's set
it's ever size that can fit into
carry-on luggage because you do not want
to check a fully built computer you want
to make sure that it's in your hands as
much as possible but nice little case
USB 3.0 and everything like that and
it's only about 80 bucks moving on for a
power split actually well there's
another look at the case we already did
that finally the power supply we needed
SFX since it's a small form-factor case
that only supports sfx power supplies
with the silverstone 500 watt version of
this presold little power supply gets
the job done I don't like the blue I
don't like the blue plug I don't know I
wish they would get rid of that single
blue plug but other than that you know
it's all black cabling and it's all flat
black cables which I might be able to
show you guys here in just a second I'll
flat black cables which should look good
not the aesthetics are too much of a
concern here but also the flat black
cabling very useful for routing and
pushing up against stuff in a case where
you have not much room to work with and
you might need to be creative with where
you actually store those cables but guys
that's all for this video this has been
my monthly builds video for September
2017 I'm gonna be building both of these
systems this month pinkie swear and I'll
be working on those actually pretty
quick and actually also have my arctic
panther water-cooled build that I'm
going to be doing this month too so stay
tuned for that thank you guys so much
for watching and links to the full
builds list on PC part picker in the
video description as well as links to
all the parts individually if you want
to check any of them out at retail most
of them are amazon links by the way
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next time
