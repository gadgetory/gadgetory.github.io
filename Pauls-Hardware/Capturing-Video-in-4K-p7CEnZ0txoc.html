hardware today's video is theoretically
going to be my setup and final
configuration and installation of this
my godly screaming and capture system
that I've been working on for quite a
while now and in fact been working on
all day today and I was hoping to be a
little bit further along right now than
I that I am but all that said I've got
an event to go to tomorrow so I'm going
to have to kind of cut it off here and
share with you guys what I've gotten
done so far so basically I started this
off yesterday and I started off by
taking my systems out in the garage my
existing streaming system and pulling
out my Blackmagic intensity Pro out of
that reinstalling it adhere to populate
the final PCI Express slot with that
installed I'm pretty much like maxed out
as far as what is connected to the
system at the 69 50 X processor that's
installed up on the top I have the gtx
980ti of course as well as the three
capture cards the input card for the 4k
the output for our card for the 4k and
then of course the 1080 in and out card
that is down at the bottom as three
different ways that I was going to set
up and catch the start I'm going to use
this system the first is going to be
just directly capturing 4k a high
quality footage from my camera that I'm
filming with right now my panasonic
lumix G H and then taking that footage
and somehow getting into a usable format
so I can send it over to my editor jail
so he can actually edit it the second
thing that I wanted to do was set up
OBS so that I can have multiple cameras
coming in one of course via the 4k
capture card another via the 1080
another via the razor ripsaw that I have
right over here that's connected via a
USB 3 and then I could add a fourth
camera via a webcam option that I have
as well that would allow me to stream in
a way that I've done when I've done live
streams before where I've done builds
and allow me to have multiple camera
setups that I can easily tap the
keyboard to switch between in order to
give myself a view of one thing or the
other the final thing that I wanted to
do and I'm probably not going to get
there at least the way I wanted just
this is again based on my testing
us to use xsplit broadcaster to capture
4k from my camera and get that set up
for our livestream awesome hardware that
we do every Tuesday so I can start
streaming that in 4k because I've got
the capabilities I should go ahead and
start streaming in 4k but that's not
going to work I'm just completely guys
you're out of front the 4k capture with
the xsplit software just doesn't work in
any way shape or form with these cards
at least I'm sure there's ways to do it
maybe I'll figure it out eventually but
not today so I'm going to skip that one
and I'll focus on the other G
configurations I've got the setup out of
my dining room one more time and that's
mainly because it's super super hot here
in California we're experiencing
heatwave in the southwest but just to
run over my configuration because I have
it kind of duplicating what would be set
up out in the garage my main camera is
right here Panasonic Lumix G H v it can
output in 4k via the HDMI 2.0 output
that's got over there can actually 4/2
to 10-bit 4k which is pretty nice
although as you may have seen in my
original video that's very challenging
to capture at least when it captures in
raw and I've been dabbling with some
options as far as compressing that video
or getting it so that when it is
captured it's actually a little bit more
usable now the main camera plugs it up
here in the input on the deck link may
4k and then you can see down here below
I have the intensity Pro which does 1080
up to 1080 60 I've labeled again all the
inputs and outputs on all those so I can
tell which is which
so first camera goes in here second
camera will potentially go into 1080
slot and that would be my trusty gh4 so
I can plug this in as a secondary camera
and then if I really needed a third
camera again I've got my razor ripsaw
down here and this can do 1080 60 and it
connects two USB 3.0 so it's external so
that at least for now I can plug in with
this third camera I have this is just a
camcorder but it does HDMI 1080 out so I
can set it up what I'll probably do
really want to do is get my other gh4
repaired that the HDMI out on that so I
can do all three really high quality
cameras and that would be pretty nice if
I wanted to add a fourth camera I do
have the web
option I probably would only do that in
a very specific situation where I need
to be able to cut over to a close-up of
something but that is how I could have
four cameras all connected up to the
system at the same time and then I can
use the software of course to switch
between them if I want to finally for
audio I have my h6 going right now of
course I have a sound board over in the
garage where I actually have things set
up but it is USB connected so basically
it's serving the same general purpose I
also popped out a couple the the two 4
terabyte drives that I had in there
because I've decided that I want to put
in fresh drives I have a couple of those
on order was hoping they'd arrive today
by now but they haven't yet that's ok
though I've still got the SSDs so those
are perfectly fine for getting things up
and running other than that I just got a
couple monitors good to go the one on
the left is 4k so I can actually view
stuff in 4k so let's test out some of
the configurations so you think with a
nice capture computer I wouldn't just be
pointing a camera at the screen no let's
see if we can do better than that
here's OBS I mean he's OBS to just
capture the 4k monitor on the left and
I'm gonna hit start recording and now
maybe maybe we can cut to that at
certain times so step one here was going
to be to use Adobe Premiere and see if I
could capture directly from that Adobe
actually does have a capture function
it's available here you can use it with
a bunch of different devices there's a
device control option that pops up and
go to settings and you can tell it's I
can even tell to use the Blackmagic
capture option that's in here but I
spent literally a couple hours going
through pretty much every setting I
could find with this looking at forums
trying to track down any information
that I could and basically I can't if
you want to use a capture device to
capture directly to Adobe Premiere Pro
then you're probably gonna have to go
with one of the more expensive like
fully licensed and tested options or
talk to Blackmagic because I couldn't
figure it out maybe they can but that's
okay I have other options so as you may
have seen in the original testing video
this is the Blackmagic Media Express
software that comes with it and it has a
log and capture function and as you can
maybe see when I pop over here it is
capturing yay I can actually see the
image coming from my gh 5 and I can see
me recording myself holding a camera
which is kind of weird but that's okay
for me to express I can pull up a menu
that will allow me to choose the project
video format and the capture format and
this capture format is the thing that I
was able to mess around with a little
bit in order to get myself a well let's
see a more ideal raw captured file I
decided on avi 10-bit y UV was the
option that I should go with basically
because that's the same thing that's
coming out of my camera and then from
there I can choose which capture folder
to go to and that kind of thing I'm
using this in tandem with Adobe in order
to capture to a watch folder and then I
can use the Adobe Media encoder software
which I'm loading up right now over here
and that will allow me to well it
watches the folder and any files that
pop up in that folder it will
automatically Rhian cut I can then have
it rien code those over to this folder
which I've made which is labeled Joe's
share folder that would be from my
editor and then once they pop into there
they should automatically if I have
BitTorrent sync setup rights start
transferring over to him now there is an
intermediary step that I haven't quite
figured out yet and that is that when
I'm capturing with the media Express
software into the watch folder it
actually doesn't immediately start to
rain coded so I might need to actually
set it to go into a folder and then have
that copy somewhere else I think it has
something to do with uh with premiere or
with the media encoder trying to do an
encode but the files locks because it's
still being written to because it's
being recorded at the time that's my
assumption for what's what's causing
that not to work but it's just a single
step for the time being I can manually
drop the files into the watch folder
when needed and then Adobe Media encoder
will Rhian code them and then they can
pop into the shared folder and then
again BitTorrent sync should immediately
start transferring it over to my editor
Joe which is pretty awesome now the
media encoder I'm actually trying to
copy those captured files into Sena form
and Sena form is a QuickTime so
basically in the export settings here
once you choose QuickTime from the
drop-down menu you can choose one of
these GoPro Sena form options again I
chose whyyou v10 bit because I'm not
actually using a 12 bit source but with
why you
tended capturing at 4k there's actually
five different quality settings you can
choose from low medium high film scan
and films can too so if a is preset for
it's about 500 megabits per second if
they use preset 3 it's 400 megabits per
second and if I use preset 2 it's 330
megabits per second preset 1 brings it
all the way down to 250 knots still
pretty pretty high if you consider my gh
5 over there that captures 4k 10 bit
files for 2 2 at 150 megabits per second
so basically I think what I'm going to
do is instead of capturing all of this
stuff at 4k I'm actually going to
transcode it down to 1080 with the
higher quality setting that's what some
of those and see what kind of bit rates
I can get this is all based on - Media
Group's testing and stuff that they've
been doing actually for a good year -
now but even with 1080 Sinha form it can
actually be rendered at 4k with pretty
much no impact on the quality so I'm
gonna give some of those tests and we'll
figure out which kind of works best and
I'm definitely going to need a little
bit more time to invest in that - to get
things going
things weren't complicated enough as it
already was I have now plugged in 2
additional cameras so one important
thing about capturing from cameras like
this especially if you're going to do a
livestream or something it's making sure
they can be always on so I actually have
AC adapters for all these going in that
just like a battery adapter that plugs
into one of these got them on eBay so
jh5 has that going there and then a nice
thin red mir hdmi cable which is going
over to the back of the system where you
showed you guys next up we have my gh4
which is now then plugged in again I'm
not really worrying about what these are
pointed at or anything like that I'm
just getting stuff set up same AC
adapter going for that one and then HDMI
out going from that again back to the
back of the system into the capture back
there down here on the floor because
they're in at a tripod is the other just
this portable camcorder which also has
an AC adapter so that's just plugged
into the wall and then again HDMI edit
that going up into the ripsaw and then
that again USB 3 back into the computer
so let's see if these will all play nice
together just getting OBS set up with my
capture devices and here's a nice thing
drop down here lists both Blackmagic
devices when I choose black magic device
from the capture devices settings so I
can see my intensity Pro see my deck
length of mini recorder 4k and here it's
just a matter of setting up for the
exact same settings that I was using
that the cameras up fitting which would
be 20 160 24 we'll leave it at 8-bit y
UV and hopefully that will work
alright guys that's all for this video
thank you so much for watching I know
this one's a little off the cuff but I
had to get this system up and running
and into production since it's a
production machine I'm going to be using
probably on a daily basis thank you so
much for watching this video though it
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
