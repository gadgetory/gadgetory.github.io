what's up guys I am in Sonoma California
I've been invited here by AMD for a
special event that they're having in the
pavilion right behind me lots of people
are gathered but I'm actually the only
youtuber here so you're getting some
exclusive content exclusive footage that
you can't find anywhere else on the
internet except potentially from all the
journalists we're back they were also
covering this event but anyway AMD has
promised some massive reveals there's
gonna be some stuff that I can share
with you guys right now and there's
gonna be more stuff coming let's say in
the next few weeks so let's get started
what are they talking about
I don't know well if you watched my
video yesterday you know they talked
about radeon instinct with just a taste
of the new Vega GPU family today we're
talking about Zen though and those
rumors you've heard are true the eight
core 16 threads n based CPU AMD has been
teasing for months will now be called
Rison not a bad name I suppose I will
nickname it mellow bread beyond the name
did they confirm a launch date no
they're still just listing ballparks
unfortunately with desktop summit ridge
chips coming in q1 2017
server Naples chips coming in q2 and
notebook chips codenamed Raven Ridge ap
use from our understanding in the second
half of next year no price updates
either sorry
we do have juicy specs though like a
pleasingly ample 20 megabytes l2 and l3
cache and a solid base frequency listed
at 3.4 gigahertz before turbo the am 4
platform meanwhile has confirmed support
for USB 3.1 gen2 nvme and i guess sure
SATA Express 2 but no one really cares
about that
inside Rison though there is a group of
technologies which AMD calls sense mi
the mi stands for machine intelligence
these are pure power precision boost
extended frequency range neural net
prediction and smart prefetch pure power
is dynamic power management it monitors
temperatures speed and voltage and as
millivolts and milliwatts accurate and
if you're wondering what Infinity fabric
is I found that just picturing Harry
Potter's invisibility cloak somehow
helped pure power works in tandem with
precision boost and precision boost is
aimed
take on devfs dynamic voltage and
frequency scaling Intel's turbo boost is
also devfs precision boost handles
on-the-fly CPU clock adjustment without
halts or queue drains and features
precision tuning with 25 megahertz
increments extended frequency range if
it works as described here is absolutely
bananas it's listed as an enthusiast
feature and seems to indicate that if
you turn it on and say upgrade your
cooling solution and give your CPU lower
temperatures the CPU will just overclock
itself to eat up the temperature
Headroom and it's fully automated I
think I just pooped my pants neural net
prediction though describes how these
CPUs slowly learn how to be more human
by watching us and learning our deepest
secrets and desires I might be inferring
this and fill a little bit but smart
prediction does mean there's a true
artificial network inside each Zenzi
Peas n CPU which builds a model of
decisions based on past software code
execution to predict future behavior and
yes they used the word scary on this
slide and I don't think it was a mistake
finally we have smart prefetch free
fetch itself is nothing new but AMD has
improved upon it and made it smarter for
Zen meaning our CPU will anticipate the
location of future data accesses by
application code while learning
algorithms model and learn to improve
its effectiveness all of these things
are cool but I think what you guys will
find most interesting is a couple
side-by-side live benchmark tests that
they ran for us in both cases they
compared a rise in CPU at 3.4 gigahertz
without turbo enabled versus a stock
6900 cake
with turbo enabled both CPUs have 8
cores and 16 threads the first demo was
a handbrake in code that took about 60
seconds and what was difficult for me to
record both of the screens at once I can
confirm that the rise in CPU won the
race by several seconds that's quite
impressive the second demo involved
blender rendering on all eight cores and
sixteen threads on both systems and both
CPUs completed it in about the same time
while also showing that both the idle
system power and the load system power
was about 15 watts less on the Rison
system I can say without a doubt that if
Rison continues to perform at this level
and efficiency when it's finally
independently tested across a range of
applications we're gonna see
huge shake-up in the consumer CPU market
so consider yourselves further teased
but also consider this the eight core
Intel Core i7 59 60 X debuted August
29th 2014 and still costs over $1000 two
years later and while reisen's q1 launch
could mean the beginning of January or
the end of March I say the sooner the
better
because I don't know about you guys but
I am totally ready for at least a
slightly more affordable eight core CPU
with present-day IPC performance that's
all for this video though guys thanks

description for links to my store as
well as further reading by some of those
respectable journalists I was hanging
out with we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
