has a wide variety of power banks this
one belongs to my wife and they have
other models available as well here's my
wife's wireless bluetooth headphones so
these she connects up to her smart phone

listening to her music or her audiobooks
it's fantastic monoprice also has these
tripods here did you know monoprice had
tripods yes there's a aluminum one

will convert in mono pods if you need
them to there's also a smaller
multipurpose tripod down there and all
of those come with carrying cases over

the glossy screen and I have done a full
video review on that so you can check
that out if you want and lastly we have
this Steve helping hands Steve model
available at monarch right soon right

we're here to support you Paul and we're
happy to do it on top of that you guys
can pick up all these products at
monoprice com alright and Steve
excellent
welcome back to the channel folks I am
going to start this gaming notebook
review out by stating a simple fact
I don't game on notebooks and not that I
never have I just tend to prefer the
desktop experience better larger screens
higher resolution more graphics
horsepower
so what Nvidia started talking up there
900 M series GPUs like they could
actually compete with desktop graphics I
was skeptical but when Oris offered me
to send me their new x7 pro sync gaming
laptop with g-sync I decided to take a
look and see for myself so your headline
items with the x7 pro sync at least the
model I have some specs may vary or of
course the not one but two gtx 970m GPUs
and sli the 2.5 gigahertz intel core i7
4870 HQ quad core cpu with 3.6 gigahertz
turbo and hyper threading 16 gigs of
ddr3 memory installed with for som slots
total available for up to 32 gigs if you
want to upgrade later and a 2 by 256
gigabyte mSATA SSD raid 0 array for the
operating system making for a super fast
512 gig main drive to go along with the
one terabyte mechanical hard drive 4
mass storage and of course we mustn't
forget g-sync variable refresh rate
technology from Nvidia that synchronizes
the displays refresh rate with the
graphics cards frames per second output
in order to eliminate tearing and
stuttering for I can't believe it's not
butter a smooth gameplay trademark on
that phrase now the X 7 X 7 Pro models
have been available from worse for some
time now unfortunately due to hardware
limitations those models can't be
upgraded to gsync via drivers or
firmware so this new model is required
if you want that new Nvidia technology
before we take a look at some benchmark
tests and performance numbers though
let's do a once-over to give you a
better feel for this laptop as a whole
size-wise the x7 pro sync remains very
slim and portable for a gaming laptop
measuring only 16.8 5 inches wide just
over 12 inches from front to back and
slim at a zero point 9 inches thick at
6.6 pounds it's lighter than most all of
the gaming laptops in its class aside
from the notable razor blade Pro and it
has an all black matte finish with a bit
of a ridge near the center of the lid
and a chromed Oris eagle logo the fact
that Oris didn't go all gamer e with the
design is a good
in my opinion and I think that this
laptop would also make a great
workstation as it would easily blend
into an office environment you'll notice
a ton of exhaust going on and near the
back and along the rear edge of the
notebook this comes into play hugely
when you're gaming under full load apart
from that there's a nice array of
connectivity along the left side there's
separate mic and headphone jacks a USB
3.0 ports d-sub VGA out HDMI out
full-size rj45 Ethernet jack and a
Kensington lock port near the back along
the back edge of the notebook there's
your primary ventilation power port and
a couple USB 2.0 ports at the centre
which is great for connecting a mouse
and keyboard up without eating up your
USB 3.0 ports on the right side there's
a mini DisplayPort out another HDMI out
two more USB 3.0 ports and an SD card
reader there's no connection points
along the front edge but you do get a
set of activity lights along the right
side for Bluetooth Wi-Fi drive activity
battery and brightness opening up the
lid reveals a chiclet style full
keyboard with numpad as well as a set of
programmable macro keys along the left
you can save sets of macros and cycle
through them with the color-coded G key
the trackpad has kind of a glass-like
surface which isn't my favorite to be
honest but the tracking was okay and I
don't think any manufacturer has yet
found a trackpad that appeals to
everyone out there the keyboard has the
typical set of function shortcut keys
that you'd expect along the top bit of
subtle highlighting along the WASD keys
because gaming notebook and I did note
that it's a pretty shallow keyboard with
not a ton of travel for the scissor
switches not a deal-breaker but
something to note if your particular
about your laptop keyboard finally on
the inside of the lid we have an HD
webcam with mic and of course the 17.3
inch IPS matte display with g-sync
support this is a 1920 by 1080 HD screen
which is good if you're considering that
it will mean higher frame rates in games
than a 1440 or 4k display but bad if you
wanted a 1440 or 4k display personally I
think 4k displays on laptops this size
are just kind of silly especially since
you'd have a hard time pushing that even
with 970 m's in SLI but 1440 might have
been a consideration here let me know in
the comments if you agree either way
though IPS means
great color reproduction the brightness
is good the contrast seems just slightly
washed out but really the special sauce
here is the G sink and I will continue
to say with laptops what I say with
desktops that variable refresh rate is
the future and you won't want to go back
to it once you've tried it some testing
though first off some battery life it's
not that wonderful maybe this is
expected in a desktop replacement /
gaming laptop you can expect two to
three hours of life with normal active
use that's with the screen on and web
browsing no power saving functions of
course and if your gaming on the battery
expect more like one to one and a half
hours this can be extended with the
power saving features that I'm going to
come back to in just a moment but just
plan on keeping that pretty hefty power
brick close at hand if you're gonna do
real work or gaming
I ran the i7 4870 HQ through Cinebench
with the score of 6:17 that's just shy
of what a desktop i7 3770 would score
and right on par with where this mobile
chip should be I fired up crystal this
mark to check the raid zero arrays
performance and was quite impressed 800
megabytes per second reads almost 900
megabytes per second writes 92 95
thousand I apps as well and all while
also being the Windows operating system
Drive finally the games first the
synthetic 3d mark and just look at some
of these score comparisons ten thousand
six hundred and seventy one on fire
strike normal better than 90% of results
5985 on fire strike extreme better than
74% of results and both times outpacing
the oculus rift were meant recommended
spec for gaming pcs these numbers are
just shy of what you get with a two-way
SLI GTX 960 desktop setup or just a bit
better than a full-size GTX 970 finally
I played some GTA 5 and whereas I was
getting 85 to 90 frames per second with
my testing setup opted to turn on g-sync
next to give that a shot it worked
beautifully matching the frame rate to
the 75 Hertz refresh of the monitor and
offering some of the smoothest gameplay
that I've ever experienced on a laptop
so to recap the positive I like this
laptops design the massive gaming
performance from the sli 970 ms the
speedy SSD array and of course the g
sync integration we do have some
negatives to point out as well though
and my big
plate would be how loud and hot this
unit can get while gaming at full speed
the primary GPU will get to around 80
degrees Celsius and the CPU often hovers
at 90 to 95 C under load the cooling
system can't handle this but only by
ramping up the fans to really high
speeds which can be quite loud
another point I'm obligated to make here
is that not all games support or scale
well with SLI so you won't always be
getting all of that GPU performance
that's in there the laptop also has a
very premium price tag with this
configuration selling for twenty six
hundred US dollars as of press time I'll
end with a good way to combat the heat
and noise though which lies in horas
software package there is the power
switch button which I only mentioned
because it's for is kind of funny way to
combat the UI shortcomings of Windows 8
by adding logout restart hibernate
buttons to the taskbar just FYI also
this laptop can be upgraded to Windows
10 for free by the way at least for the
remainder of the next year the more
important software is the command and
control module which gives you a simple
way to enable or disable SLI and gsync
you can also reduce blue light output to
minimize eyestrain pull up a system
monitor or shortcut to some other
features that are usually hidden in the
control panel but it also allows you to
adjust fan controls and performance
modes this means it can give up some
performance to quiet the system down and
get yourself a nice balance between
frame rate and fan noise making your
ears bleed so in conclusion I will be
selling off all of my desktop hardware
to become a full-time laptop PC gamer
now that's that's not really true I am
still a desktop gamer and I don't think
that will change anytime soon but the
Auris x7 pro sync does have an audience
out there and it is a very well designed
laptop if the cons that I've listed
today do not deter you if you need a
desktop gaming performance in a portable
package and if you have the scratch to
buy it of course and especially if you
want to give g-sync a shot and have it
ruin you for gaming on non g-sync
systems for the foreseeable future
I think this laptop is a great choice
for you donate my viewers out there roll
with gaming laptops though I am I'm
curious so let me know what gaming
laptop you have if any in the comment
