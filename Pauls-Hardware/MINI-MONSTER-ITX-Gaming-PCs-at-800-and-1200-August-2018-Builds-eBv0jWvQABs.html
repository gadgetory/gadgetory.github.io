what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware this is my monthly builds video
for august 2018 i have two mini ITX
systems today and $800 and $1200 but if
you're not familiar with this series
every month at the beginning of the
month i part out a couple pcs so you
guys at home if you're trying to build
your own pc get a better idea of what
parts to choose and how i go about that
process later in the month i then build
one of the pcs and then follow it up
with some testing after that so
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already if you want to catch those
videos when they come out now if you're
interested in a video where actually
build a computer check out my builds
playlist I have plenty of those
available and I'll link that in the
description and a strawpoll is available
down there too where you guys can vote
on what builds you want to see in
September since your feedback is what my
upcoming builds are based on and this is
actually a multiple-choice response here
so the top two are kind of what are you
choosing between here or choose between
AMD and Intel or choose between high end
desktop and mainstream or give me a
budget range and I'll sort of compile
all those results and come out with
something next month last month though
you guys voted on a mini ITX gaming
build you wanted mid-range and I
actually have a couple one that's a
little bit higher end and one that's
probably mid-range now today instead of
just rattling off the parts for you guys
and giving some notes on each one I
thought I would go through my actual
thought process as I put these builds
together and this was based on two
primary things one being that mini ITX
form factory requirements and the second
being the recent launch of B 450
motherboards this provides a less
expensive option for people want to
build a rise in horizon 2 based system
and it's still overclockable and of
course available in mini ATX form factor
like this one right here from asus
although i didn't actually choose this
one for today cuz it's a little bit on
the more expensive side but i digress
here's build number one though coming in
at about twelve hundred dollars actually
just under twelve hundred dollars
total down there so we have a risin
seven 2700 a B 450 mini ITX motherboard
16 gigs of memory a 480 gig SSD a gtx
1070 TI graphics card a mini ITX case
from rio toro and a 650 watt 80 plus
gold rated power supply so overall
really nice set of components 8 core
processor means you can not just game
but you can also do video editing or
other tasks that are CPU intensive
you're gonna be somewhat limited on
expandability with the system due to the
form factor but it's still incredibly
powerful in a very small package and not
too crazy high of a price so here's
where I started mini ITX was the
requirements so I started by looking at
mini ITX cases that are available and
gosh there are quite a few of them and
there's even some quite inexpensive ones
down in the 40 to 50 dollar range so I
looked at quite a few of these before
deciding on the ryote or OCR 280 for
this build it is pretty small it's still
the vertical tower style orientation but
it comes with a couple hundred and 20
millimeter fans it's a pretty simple
design aesthetic that I don't think too
many people will be offended by and it's
got a little bit of red highlighting on
there if you're into some red accents
also airflow is pretty decent on this
case and you do get a side panel window
so you can look in at your finish build
also it supports full-size ATX power
supplies which means you can save a
little bit of money by not having to buy
an SFX power supply now there's a ton of
cases in this range about sixty to
eighty dollars mini ATX honorable
mentions that I did not choose but you
could totally go with is the NZXT h 200
or h 200 I
thermaltake corvy one that I worked with
recently fractal define nano s or the
fractal node - OH - or the fantex
evolved ITX all really solid cases and
you could totally swap them into this
bill without any troubles so if the case
picked out I moved onto the motherboard
next I know I won't be 450 and I know I
want Mini ITX there's a lot of be 450
motherboards more coming out probably on
a daily basis right now because they are
very new but if I go down here and
choose just mini ITX boards there's
actually only three listed at least on
PC part picker right now this this ROG
Strix from Asus which is a hundred and
sixty dollars which is just it's very
expensive and we're not going over the
top here so I opted for the MSI B 450
gaming plus AC there's also an asrock
option down here the feature set is
pretty similar between these two I went
with
ms:i honest and just because it was five
bucks cheaper but either of these would
be a good choice but some things to
point out that are pretty nice about
these before 50 boards is they have
built in 802 dot 11 AC Wi-Fi it's got a
USB 3.1 gen2 and you should keep an eye
out for at least one m dot 2 slot on
these for a lot of mini ITX boards they
put it on the back now for the CPU I
wanted to go with an 8 core because I
think in the Mini ITX form-factor and
with everything that AMD has done with
Rison over the past year and a half or
so
gettin 8 cores in the Mini ITX is pretty
sweet
now if you want 8 cores and you want
second-generation Rison you have to pay
a bit of a premium right now you can
actually get the 8 core 1700 for about
220 dollars to jump up to the 2700 which
is the 8 core second gen rise and the
second generations are the ones that
start with 2000 here by the way it's
$280 so I went with that because second
gen Rison and B 450 seems to match up
but you could also easily go with the
1700 here for 220 heck you can get the
1800 X right now for 240 it's really up
to you but 8 cores is 8 cores really if
you want to shave the price down you're
gonna need to drop down to 6 cores which
is what I did for the follow-up 800
build but before moving on to that the
next thing you're going to want to do is
choose memory here i wanted 16 gigs
since there are only 2 DIMM slots that
means we want a 16 gig
2 by 8 gig kits appétit for ddr4 3000 or
3200 as our options here because you get
better speed and better overall
performance at a verizon with some
faster memory and then here's where I
very much recommend double checking your
chosen motherboard to make sure that you
have rising compatibility with the
memory that you choose this 8 a 2 x PG
gamax d-10 kit has proven to be
compatible with Rison and it's different
flavors and it's only a hundred and
sixty dollars or only about eight or
nine dollars more than the cheapest 16
gig kit of ddr4 3000 memory so I chose
that it's red by the way it's also
available in black for like five more
bucks if you guys wanted to go with that
instead next we needed storage and here
again I went with a very simple
compatibility feature which is one of
the things you can do on PC part picker
in the 500 gig range so you're looking
at 480 gig and 512 get compatible SSDs
the cheapest one here is this team l5
light 3d 480 gig SSD when you're using
the parametric filters here always
double check reality check
kind of what the
cheapest options are and make sure
you're not getting like some cut-rate
product that you've never heard of
before team is a company that I've
worked with and they make solid products
the l5 light it's not gonna be super
fast but it's an SSD will get you by and
it's 480 gigs next a graphics card here
I was looking at the $400 in up range so
gtx 1070 but if you're looking at a 1070
might as well look at 1070 TI i think
you're looking at 1070 TI might as well
keep an eye out on 10 80s right because
if you're looking at the cheapest 1070
right now it's 400 bucks and there's
some other options of course maybe spend
10 20 dollars more to get yourself a
slightly better version maybe with a
better cooler but then you're like oh
well cheapest 1070 TI right here is $435
it's pretty reasonable and it's actually
a few right here for $435 I opted for
the so tech mini here because we do have
a smaller case and we want to make sure
it's simple the case actually is
compatible with a reasonable size a
range of graphics cards but smaller is
generally okay and this otech mini card
works just fine it's still got two fans
for cooling by the way if you're
spending four hundred thirty-five
dollars in a 1070 TI why not spend $450
in a 1080 those have come down and
priced quite a bit too so this is of
course the dilemma that everyone who
parts out a PC gets into that just these
slight upgrades that you can get for
just a little bit more money
it's a creeping problem but just base
things on what your budget can afford
and know that even if you get a 1070
1070 TI or 1080 they're all really solid
cards you'll just get more frames with
it with the higher-end
card ok finally we needed a power supply
and for most standard gaming PC's I
recommend between 550 and 650 watts for
a PSU I'm also taking a look at the
higher wattage here options and I want
with 80-plus gold because I will give
you some good efficiency while that's
commanding the price premium that the 80
plus platinum stuff does we can get a
Roseville cap stuff capstone 550 watt
for $43 here but that has ketchup and
mustard cables that aren't that pretty
so here's how I found the Corsair TX 650
M this is actually on sale right now so
this price probably won't hold
but $55 here for this power supply a
very solid Corsair power supply it's got
all black cables it's got partial is it
partially or fully modular it's
partially modular but that's still handy
on a mini ITX build and there you go
guys for about $1,200
a really really powerful eight-course
system with 16 gigs of memory and a
really powerful graphics card of course
there are some slight upgrades there's
like downgrades you can switch around if
you wanted to raise the lower the price
or increase or decrease the performance
to meet your needs but let's do one
quick look at the follow up build which
is really just a slight variation of the
$1200 build I just did but I shaved $400
off the price so here's the $800 more
mid-range Mini ITX gaming PC and it's
based on roughly the same platform we
got the same case with the Rio Toro case
here we've got the same motherboard with
the MSI be 450 here I have downgraded
the CPU a little bit to the 6 core 2600
that's gonna save us $100 two less cores
but you can still overclock it so for
gaming and everything this is going to
be super awesome gaming and streaming -
I cut a memory in half down to eight
gigs so two by four gigs this is really
just what you need to get by right now
and it's still just under $100 I'd
recommend more memory if you're gonna
choose one thing in this set of parts to
upgrade but beyond that we've got a 240
gig SSD which you can get for $45 again
this is saving some money here but it's
really not that much more to go for 480
gigs so very much consider that if you
don't want to be swapping out an SSD in
the future we downgraded the graphics
card to the EVGA GTX 1066 gig it's only
270 dollars though so that shaved a ton
of money off the price and still a very
capable graphics card same case of
course and then we've got a Rosewell
capstone 550 watt power supply which
again saves us a little bit of money but
not a whole lot here again I might just
up for that 80 plus gold 650 watt unit
because the capstone does have ketchup
and mustard cables which won't look very
pretty but if you're on a budget ketchup
and mustard cables don't really matter
when it comes to performance and you can
get this whole system for 800 dollars
and here again very well rounded system
actually extremely close in specs and
performance to the $800 builds that I
recently did in my $800 how to build a
PC video as well as the setup video that
I followed it up with so if you guys are
interested in how to build a PC
definitely check out that video and
check out the setup video too if you
want to know the steps to go through if
you're setting up your PC for the very
first time installing Windows and
getting your drive set up and of course
leave me a comment in the comment
section to let me know what you
of these builds if there's any spin on
it that you would put to sort of give it
your own flavor or maybe he got a little
bit more performance and of course don't
forget to vote on the straw poll for
next month's builds because there's a
lot of exciting hardware coming out that
I am looking forward to working with
thank you guys so much for watching this
video though and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
