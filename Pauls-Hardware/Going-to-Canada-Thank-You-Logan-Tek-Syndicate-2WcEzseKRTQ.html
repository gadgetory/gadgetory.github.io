episode of Paul's hardware this is
really quick one just sort of an update
in some news and some stuff first off
wanted to say a big thank you to another
fellow youtuber has recently given me a
very nice plug that's Logan Logan tech
syndicate want to say a huge thank you
to Logan I met him a while back and he's
a great guy I love his videos i love his
stuff I aspire to have my setup here
look anything like his because his
videos look amazing also what's up max
how's it going you're lucky you're
working with Logan now look I have notes
so I can stand on track of what's going
on here okay so thanks Logan that's
number one number two is I'm going to
Canada actually I'm going to Canada also
Cal's going to Canada also the infamous
mr. lamb will be going to Canada as well
this weekend we're going for the AMD
extravaganza it's in markham ontario on
october 20th and it's a saturday so if
you're in the area and you want to go
you should go can say hi to me really
wandering around talking to people and
making video and and should be fun
lastly I want to answer just at least a
couple questions that were posted on
some of my videos the first one from the
recent video this one my wife's computer
was what's your video card because you
guys noticed that there's no video card
in there is an msi gtx 460 twin frozer
free of his twin frozr one or two I
think it's too yeah it's got two fans so
it's too it works great for her so we're
going to carry it over to this new
system she mostly plays Wow sometimes
roller coaster tycoon so it's more than
enough for what she does see she's
laughing anything other question I want
to answer was what do I use to record
videos I can't show you because I'm
recording on right now but here's the
box it's the canon 5d mark two which
means my video should look a lot better
than their they do i've only got one
lens for right now it's like a 50
millimeter it's like the cheapest lens
you can buy for it i'm going to get
another one soon so i can get like a
wider angle and do other fancy stuff but
that's what i'm using right now that's
all for this video i just want to give
you an update hope to see some of you in
ontario possibly some of the fans at
line is sent my way I don't think Linus
is going to be there he said he's got
some baby
like that but anyway thanks for watching
guys subscribe if you want to and see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
