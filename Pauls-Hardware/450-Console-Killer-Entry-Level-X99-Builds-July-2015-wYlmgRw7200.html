today's video is my July builds if you
guys saw my video in May I decided hey
every month of the beginning of the
month I'm going to do monthly builds I
am 1 for 2 so far because I did not do
this at the beginning of June because I
was at Computex I was still gonna do it
but then too much time went by anyway
point being welcome to my July builds
for 2015 and the two builds that I'm
going to go over today are pretty
interesting I kind of like them one is
an entry-level x99 system or haswell-e
and those two terms don't necessarily go
together but I'll explain when we come
to that one kind of what I what my mo
was for that particular build we also
have a $450 console killer I'm using the
term console killer because it's very
popular in search results search results
right now but yeah it's a foreign $50
build with the potential for a GPU
upgrade and I think you guys will like
that one - that's a good of re-build
godhavari it's the new AMD APU
but the way this is gonna work these
videos in general is at the beginning of
each month I will introduce a couple new
builds and you guys can take those
builds and rework them for yourselves or
just go for it and build them if you
want to I'm going to be using PC part
pickers so a big thanks to them for
building a fantastic website that makes
it really easy to put builds together
the links to PC part picker will be in
the video's description on youtube so
you can check that out but also there is
interaction involved with this video
because I want you guys to tell me what
builds you want me to do next month if
that makes sense so I have a strawpoll
link I'm also doing this live did I
mention this is live yeah now the straw
pull link I'll post there that and chat
if you guys want to want to check that
out and right over here so go to the
straw poll and vote on what kind of
system builds you guys want to see me do
in August so I have another console
killer and all-around one a few other
options in there and you can choose more
than one choice so go ahead and do that
and it will be fun and fantastic in the
meantime though let's dive right into
build number one which is my $450
console killer now basically what I
wanted to do with this
build that's the way the way I do all
these builds is I come at it with sort
of an idea of the build overall so
console killer was what I was going for
I was going for low budget so you want
around 400 500 ish dollars if you're
going for the console killer thing
because it needs to be price competitive
with the consoles of course and then
from there I just chose parts that I
felt were appropriate for this level of
build in this price points and then I
picked what's what now of course there's
options for pretty much every single
part in here for the most part that you
can swap out but you can do that or you
can use my building and do whatever you
want I did make a couple of assumptions
with this build though one is that you
it does not have a GPU you're gonna be
using the APU that's what keeps the
price down but you could easily upgrade
to a GPU in the future second assumption
is that there's no mass storage included
with this particular bill which means
that you would probably want to add some
I did do an SSD because that's kind of
my mo for builds in general I like to
have SSDs they're just a lot faster it
gives a much better computing experience
but you will probably run out of space
fairly quickly especially if you're
installing video games on the system so
another hard drive to add to this system
and older like I don't know 500 gig or
terabyte hard drive that you might have
lying around would really round the
whole thing out although other than that
there's an SSD included and and let's
just kind of start talking about the
parts now AMD has been doing ap use for
a while and this is their gut Avari and
d810 78 70 K this is what it's based
around so this is the basically the CPU
and GPU in one now I most often
recommend AMD's AP use because on the
CPU side they're not incredibly powerful
intel has more powerful CPU options at
that at this price point which is right
around a hundred and fifty bucks by the
way but AMD's integrated graphics are
very good and especially for what you
get and everything so this is their
newest one it's good of re is the
codename for at seventy eight seventy K
it's 3.9 gigahertz it's quad core and
the integrated graphics you can get by
with playing games on so that's kind of
where we're starting off the next is the
motherboard which you kind of need a
home base for this type of thing of
course I wanted Mini ITX because the
console killer thing seems to fit
better when it's actually console sized
or roughly that size for fitting in a
home theater or something like that
so this as rocks FM 288 X I TX plus
motherboard pretty basic mini ITX
motherboard there's not actually not a
whole lot of mini ITX FM to plus some
other boards that are out there but this
one's very full-featured you've got tons
of choices as far as I oh there's the
connectivity at the back so you got a
couple HDMI is in a dual link DVI and
this again will get you by and it has a
PCI Express x16 slot which you're not
going to use for this particular build
but you would use if you wanted to drop
a graphics card in here and I'd say for
this build 150 to 200 a graphics card
would do a great job something like a
gtx 960 for example or a m-- these
competing graphics cards in the same
range you do need memory and whenever
you're doing an APU builds and you're
relying on the integrated graphics this
is the only time I really recommend
getting faster memory this is why this
g.skill ripjaws z kit that I chose is
actually 2,400 speed which is pretty
fast for a ddr3 memory you can get by
with 1600 speed with a normal build but
the 2400 speed memory in this case will
give you much better GPU performance for
if you're using the integrated GPU of
course and only 60 bucks for a 2x4 gig
kit pretty good deal
alright moving along I didn't integrate
storage and like I said I like to do
SSDs so this is an a data Premiere Pro
SP 600 I've used the m2 version of this
drive actually it's pretty pretty solid
drive I forget the controller that it
uses all I know is it's not SandForce
when it comes to SATA rev3 SSDs as long
as it's not sand force I mean San force
drives are okay too it's just you you
don't always get the best performance
when it comes to come in compressible
data whereas the other drives that are
using other controllers don't suffer
from that problem anyway so there's your
solid-state drive the a data premiere
pro and only 80 bucks for a 256 gig
freaking SSD that's incredible for a
case I went with an old standby for Mini
ITX that's the cooler Master Elite 130
you can see this has very good ratings
across the board and that is because of
multiple different things here let's
check out
the actual Newegg page four is 45 bucks
there is a newer version of this but
it's like 30 or 40 bucks more it's got a
nice overall look it's got USB 3.0 in
the front mini ITX even you have a
full-size five-minute quarter inch bay
that you can use or not use depending on
how you want to configure things and and
new gigs makes pictures aren't loading
it for me very fast it's got a pretty
good layout inside and you can fit a
full-size ATX power supply full ATX
although the length of it might be
limited but this has really good reviews
overall and I've worked with it before
so it's a case that I can recommend and
for the price which is as little as
thirty bucks right now if you are ok
with mail and rebates holy crap the
elite 130 from Coolermaster and that
brings us to the last component for this
build which is the power supply and for
this one my qualifications for the power
supply was I wanted around 500 watts so
you could accommodate a full-size GPU if
you decided to drop that in here
I wanted 80 plus bronze at least which
this has ATX of course to be compatible
with the case and then I wanted one that
was short basically short when it comes
to the length of this way hundred and
forty millimeters is about as short as
you can get and the EVGA what is what's
the stupid model on this one again the
500 Watts 500 B is the model on this one
80 plus bronze it's got a single 12 amp
or 12 volt rail granted the cabling is
not that pretty but hey this is a budget
build so you got to make do with certain
stuff it is not modular which is the
other limitation but honestly when
you're working in a small case sometimes
non modular power supplies can be better
only in certain situations because you
don't use quite as much space for dem
plugs that are going up in there but
okay let's move right along that is my
first build which again is the $450
console killer now if you guys are
looking at this and being like it sucks
because it doesn't have a graphics card
well you're right to some extent it
could it would be much better with a
graphics card but I always like having
the upgrade path with any system that I
design and as previously mentioned you
could easily drop a nice graphics card
in here for 150 or 200 bucks really bump
up your gaming performance but for the
time being for around 450 bucks
you can get this all put together on the
hardware side and you can get yourself a
computer you can use the game that's
small it's not gonna use a whole lot of
power - yeah I liked how that one turned
out I was actually aiming for a more
like a $500 price point and then it came
out to me 450 and as like hey sweet
that's that's super sweet
anyway let's move on to the next build
which is my entry-level x99 build now
x99 is intel's enthusiast platform
that's the highest of the high end and
intel has been segmenting their there
their consumer platforms like this for I
don't know how many years now three four
five six seven eight eight or nine years
it's hard to say 2006 2007 I think was
when they first brought out X 79 anyway
X 99 is awesome because it's where you
can get the fastest hardware that's
available it's the only place to get
ddr4 memory right now all that will be
changing soon when skylake launches next
month
it's it's going to remain faster than
the skylake we can we can be pretty
confident of that right now which means
that if you're going to build a system
right now but you're worried oh maybe I
should wait for skylake then this is a
good way around it because you don't
have to worry about sky like being
fasters sky like might be faster on the
cpu like per instructions per clock side
but it's really not something I would be
overly concerned about so let's say you
want the X 99 you want the power you
want the longevity because X 99 platform
usually remains valid for a good three
years you want the general badassery of
being like I've got a you know a 5000
series X 99 processor LGA 2011 - three
motherboard Dixon and chipset and
haswell-e but it's expensive to get in
on the ground floor even at the base
level products is well expensive
especially if you looked at when it
launched last year because ddr4 prices
were insanely expensive but ddr4 prices
have come down so it's a lot more
accessible now and as previously
mentioned who cares if skylake is
launching if you're on x99 with the
haswell-e now you could with this go
like full budget you could just be like
I want the cheapest parts possible but I
do feel like this platform kind of lends
itself to
a higher standard so I wasn't going for
the cheapest of the cheap when it comes
to the components here I was looking for
stuff that was inexpensive but
commensurate with the power and and
prestige that comes with x99 and
haswell-e so let's move on to this build
here and let's start off by saying that
the CPU in this case is pretty much a
no-brainer there's only three CPUs
available on this platform a 59 60 X is
$1,000 the 59 30k is that I think 550 or
600 5820k which is what we're going to
be using is much more reasonably priced
although granted it is still three
hundred and seventy dollars that's if
you buy it here now if you live close to
a Micro Center and I said this in the
last video too you can get it for 300
bucks but you got to go into a store and
pick that up and then you have to buy a
bunch of other stuff from you don't
really have to buy other stuff from
Micro Center but that is a good way of
saving some money on your processor but
we're not going with my car Micro Center
prices here we're going with full prices
with a 5820k it's a 3.3 gigahertz it's
six cores it gives you pretty much
everything the 59 30k gives except I
believe it has a little bit less cash
and you get fewer PCI Express Lanes
the PCI Express Lanes were concerned for
me at launch but if you're not planning
on doing like a three or four-way SLI
configuration or like maxing out all of
your storage then the lanes you get with
the 5820k which oh gosh what is it 28 I
think you get 28 you're still you're
still pretty good alright moving on to
the next piece we need a cooler of
course I'm not going to go with the
stock cooler like I did in the last
build since this is a higher-end one and
you can't you know do get it you don't
get a cooler with the 5820k so you need
something I went with an air cooler this
is kind of me sticking with the whole
like I think air coolers do a really
good job and save you a good amount of
cash over the larger size say 240
millimeter all in one liquid coolers and
this is actually a throwback to the last
may builds because I already used this
in the may builds this is enter Max's
cooler that's a super tiny picture of it
maybe there's a better picture on NCIX
let's see but it's black it does a
really good job you can get it for 40 or
45 bucks and if that's your range your
price range 30 to 45 bucks ish for a CPU
cooler I think this one will do a good
job for you alright that's not low
so I'm just gonna leave it but yeah 40
bucks right now at ncx us and the other
thing oh did I mention yet that I'm
going to be building this system I'm
gonna be building this system so there
was a slight influence of that and the
fact that I have this cooler definitely
helped me out as well or influenced my
decision for it alright next we have a
weird one whoops wrong button next we
have a weird one in this gigabyte
motherboard this is actually a
placeholder that I used I chose this
excited on gaming which is a perfectly
fine and legitimate motherboard for LG
it's 102 2011 - 3 it's a little bit more
expensive it's about well it's still
reasonable 260 ish but the board I'm
actually gonna be using for the build is
this brand new one from gigabyte this is
the x99 sli yeah it's $250 going back to
my like mo for like choosing the parts
for this and look I even have a I even
have it my ammo for choosing the parts
for this build was at least for the
motherboard side was at launch all the
motherboards were like 300 bucks they
have some that came down to like 250 ish
I was thinking 200 to 250 dollars so
that's why the x99s sli I thought was a
good choice from gigabyte it's from
gigabyte so you know it's got all their
ultra durable quality and stuff in there
ton of features on the board and the one
qualification that I really didn't want
to shirk since I am going for a full
size build with this with this but this
build is 4 X 99 I like having 8bim slots
and there are some less expensive boards
in this that have four dimm slots but I
just like having eight I like being able
to expand that memory because if you're
on this platform chances are you're
doing a bit more than gaming and having
more to work with will be a good option
alright so there's the motherboard the
x99s sli although again I did a
workaround with it and it did a
placeholder let's move on down the line
we need memory of course look at this
g.skill ripjaws 16 gig kit ddr4 21 33
this is a black kit because it matches
with just about everything and this this
kit costs 130 dollars
one-thirty right now do you remember
when ddr4 came out last year this kit
was 300 bucks so that's the benefit of
ramping up production I suppose because
I I really like that you can get ddr4 so
cheap and especially important since
Galax coming out and people are going to
be looking for it on not just the x99
platform
alright so memory is taken care of and
and oh by the way that's what I consider
to be the bare minimum for this platform
4x4 gigs unless you're dealing with like
fewer memory slots or or you're just
really going super budget but like I
don't know you you're getting a quad
channel platform should use quad channel
memory oh and hello to everyone who is
joined in chat thank you thank you guys
all for jumping in and joining me here
hope you're enjoying ok let's move on to
storage here
I wanted a 500 gig SSD here's another
place where you can save some money if
you're going entry-level x99 is maybe a
256 gig SSD but again this is this is
enthusiast platform so it's like the
torrent or the 500 gig the 250 gig
drives have dropped so much you saw the
one in the first build for 80 bucks you
can get a get a 500 gig 850 Evo which is
a higher-end SSD for 165 ish and 70
that's for 5 500 gig SSD I have to say
having a 500 guest gig SSD is awesome
and just load all your games onto it
it's fantastic
an Evo series is one that I've worked
with and I liked I did add some mass
storage here just a WD caviar green 3
terabyte 5400 rpm internal drive a quick
tip for you guys who don't follow the
commodities market very much the d odd
quantity drives or like capacity drives
like your 3 terabyte drives for example
or your 1.5 terabyte drives that were
out for a little while didn't sell as
well as the even drives like your 2
terabytes and your 4 terabytes for that
reason only occasionally I've noticed
you can find three terabyte drives for a
considerable deal
and that's not to say I did a whole lot
of searching around for this one but a
caviar green is a good Drive it's not
super fast but it's not going to use a
lot of power and just for mass storage
it's a great job and it's less 100 bucks
that less than a hundred bucks for 3
freaking terabytes so that's pretty good
too yeah
now I'm gonna come back to the graphics
card graphics cards most controversial
decision for this and and I want to come
back to it
let's talk case though we have a fan
text enthu Pro and again if you guys
aren't familiar you guys are probably
familiar with them through pro this is
one of the cases that came out within
the last year that just kind of blew
everyone away as far as its capabilities
and everything and I have not even
worked with it I have done next to zero
with it other than watching dimitra's
dimitris fantastic video and can't be
like wow that looks like a really nice
case but fortunately I am now I'm now
actually I have one of these being
shipped here I'm gonna do this build in
this case so I'm gonna get stri at the
end through pro and if you guys are
watching this video in the future check
out the end through em from fantex it's
not available right now I was gonna see
if I could get it for this build because
it's gonna be a it's like the enthu Pro
kind of with a few parts stripped out
but you still get the same general
chassis a lot of the same features and
it's cheaper I think it's 70 or 80 bucks
depending on what color you get but that
would be a great way of getting a case
that again is going to fit with this
type of build and my price range for
case and this one was about 80 to 100
bucks
that's kind of what I felt where you can
get a nice case that would get the job
done but not look like you're cutting
corners too much and buying like the
cheapest $40 like $40.00 ATX case that
you can find rounding out the parts here
for the power supply I have this one
this is a thermal take 750 watt 80 plus
gold semi modular ATX power supply now
this one again I chose for a few
different reasons I was looking for less
than hundred dollars to the power supply
I wanted at least 700 watts
I wanted 80 plus gold because I wanted
to hire a better efficiency and higher
build quality and those were kind of my
main qualifying factors this fell in
here and it worked out perfectly because
it's got actually some pretty good
cabling which is another thing that I'm
looking at was power supplies more so
these days if you guys have been
watching my channel recently you might
know why it's got nice black cabling so
it's going to look good to 80 plus gold
rated it's got good reviews overall good
internal
quality and I have not this power supply
but I have a very very similar power
supply to this over here
the tough power DPS G which is more
expensive than this but it meant that I
already had the power supply used for
the build so that was my other reasoning
behind this one okay finally finally
finally the video card now here's what
it comes down to for the video card for
this system like there's so many options
and I was really really torn and
originally I was going to say get a
980ti or a fury X cuz both of them are
about 650 bucks you know there's things
you could say about either of them and
you know I think that would get the job
done but that would bring the price
point up a fair amount so that's why I
didn't choose them at least specifically
for this right now
the other options that are out there
other than the 390 X which I've chosen
here let me actually show you guys the
video card that I chose rather than just
sitting here talking about it this is
the MSI Radeon r9 390x 8 gig video card
and you can see a picture of it right
there looks very similar to a lot of the
gaming graphics cards lately but that's
the twin frozer 5 cooler I believe and
it does a really good job so the reason
I chose this was it's it's newer which
you know which is nice when it's newer
granted is still 290x on crack but I'm
reason number 2 I have it so I can do
the build with it I also found that for
the price point for this which is a
little over 400 bucks right now about
420 or four hundred and thirty dollars
you get a lot of performance you get
eight gigs of VRAM and you get the best
GPU that AMD is making right now outside
of the fury without spending as much
money on the fury and the reviews for
the 390x
even compared to even knowing that it's
it's it's a 290x kind of cracked out
with a gigs a ram have been very
positive so for that reason that's why
I'm with this so you guys can feel free
to argue in the comments if you agree
with that decision or you don't agree
with that decision but at least for the
sake of posterity other options out
there would have been a 970 a GTX 970 on
the Nvidia side of course or even a 399
X version if you're going for more budge
it you could go you can go with the GTX
980 for more money although the 390 X
and the 980 have the in the l-39 TX can
beat out the 980 at times especially if
you're looking for higher resolutions so
if you're going for 4k maybe something
to consider and then of course the 980
TI or the fury X on the top end which
again it's it's just more money it's
another another 200 plus dollars that
you're adding on top so there you have
it but those are my builds and I hope
you guys have learned a little bit about
well the builds and maybe giving you
guys some ideas for builds of your own
or maybe you just take my builds and
build them that'd be cool
I'm gonna do that with at least the
entry-level x99 build in just a while
and I will say it's nice that you can
get a fully fleshed out like like pretty
pretty good high-end system with the
5820k in it for $1,700 so as this
actually comes in less than $1,700
that's a lot less than you would have
needed to spend say six seven months ago
so I thought that was a win overall but
guys don't forget to vote on the straw
poll and let me know what builds what
builds you want me to work on for next
month don't forget to leave me comments
in the comment section and argue over
whether I made the right choice with
using the 390 X in my entry-level x99
bill sorry for some of the background
noise well yeah do all that stuff and
thank you guys so much for watching my
channel of course you can subscribe for
more videos just like this one and we'll
see you next time on Paul's hard way
you guys are fantastic Thanks thanks for
being here
all right everyone we'll see you all
later have a good day oh-o-oh tune in
tomorrow tomorrow's Tuesday we'll be
doing will be doing awesome Hardware
tomorrow that's over on the awesome
hardware channel though but I will be
streaming back on this channel tomorrow
night oh there wouldn't look at that
that's perfect timing
this is something telling me I should
stop streaming cuz the camera just
turned off okay I'm cutting the stream
