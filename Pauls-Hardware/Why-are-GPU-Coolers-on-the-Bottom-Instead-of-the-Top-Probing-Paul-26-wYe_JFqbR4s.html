what's up guys how's it going and
welcome back to another episode of
probing Paul this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A
series and it's getting towards the end
of July so I better do my july one this
is episode number 26 so thanks to all
you guys who are watching and if you've
wanted watch the old ones there's all of
the past probing Paul's that have done
and probes so many times now but it
never gets old all the questions from
this episode were derived from last
month's episode of probing table which
was actually at the end of May
technically speaking but let's not get
too hung up on the schedule first
question is from the sycophant who says
hey p-- or the sycophant i don't know
anyway hey Paul a simple question which
internet connection are you sitting on I
don't usually sit on my internet
connection that can be uncomfortable but
I assume you mean who provides my
internet connection and maybe how fast
it is so frontier FiOS I have
fiber-to-the-home here in Southern
California which is nice and I'm
currently paying for a hundred up and a
hundred down or at least that's what
they tell me I'm supposed to get so
let's double check it here Real Time
with the Google internet speed test
checker
oh look at that upload speed upload
speeds looking nice can you get a quick
second opinion here by using ullas
speedtest.net to do another speed test
and there you go there's my current
internet speeds hundred little over 100
down getting up tardes hundred and
twenty up which is nice for uploading
the YouTube videos getting similar
results from speedtest.net so there you
go and yes with fiber-to-the-home I
could be getting much faster speeds than
this but you know they make you pay more
for more bandwidth so for now this is
just fine for me
next question from Ricki VA policy lots
of monitors in the background of your
shooting space I would like you to
explain their uses as well as how many
computers that you keep in your shooting
space so have lots of computers here at
home and I don't consider my setup here
to be practical and more computers than
I actually need so I don't use them all
all the time but right behind me right
now is
riptide and that's still in the process
of getting set up for my actual studio
space here in the garage I have three
monitors and two computers the computer
there in the back is arctic Panther
which I built over the course of several
years has many different ideations
there's a long video series on that one
monitor here is the Acer predator X 34 I
used that as my primary gaming monitor
and arctic panther is my primary gaming
computer however because it's been
really hot right now and the garage has
been very hot I haven't been gaming on
that very much
also my wife and I have been playing a
good amount of overwatch lately an
overwatch doesn't benefit very much from
an ultra-wide Monitor 21 by night it
actually crops what you see so you get a
better gameplay experience on 16 by 9
that said the secondary purpose is that
system is just to be a pretty background
system which it does more often than a
game on it recently but I do a game on
that system secondary system is this one
right here which is affectionately known
as the godly streaming PC which I built
last year it's got a 69 50 X and it
handles capture like I'm capturing this
video that I'm shooting right now on
that system I can also do much
transcoding I used to handle our weekly
live show that I do as Kyle awesome
hardware on Tuesday evenings and this
has two monitors both of them are 2560
by 1440 and that's just to give me
plenty of working space to work with so
that when I'm setting up stuff like this
I have screen space next question from
hawk one two nine one Paul since you
worked at Newegg maybe you can answer
this why do graphics card retailers
typically show pictures of cards from
every view except for the ones most
people will actually see it from this is
a very good question and yes I did used
to work at Newegg although I haven't
worked there for quite a few years now
so what I'm saying now is based on
historical knowledge and might not
necessarily be true for what they do now
but Newegg at least when I worked there
had a pretty awesome photo team and any
product that came in they would take
photos of so for example this is a Asus
rx 580 and I'm pretty sure the photo
team did the photos on this one just
based on looking at them and here
they're actually thankfully at least
giving you a shot of the back of the
card and that's often very key you often
don't see this and then here's maybe a
shout out the side of the card but
you're right
not the orientation that you would
actually see it in at least you can see
some of the details like does it have an
8 pin
6-pin PCI Express graphics power
connector now also when I worked there
knew it would sometimes get pictures
directly from the manufacturer and I
think I'm not sure but I think that is
the case with this EVGA card and here
again they're kind of showing you the
side of it a little bit but again it's
not at that right angle and none of
these pictures show the back of it like
one of the things I would want to see
first and foremost here does it have a
backplate and you just can't tell by
looking at these pictures you'd have to
go and look at reviews or something like
that so I guess I don't really have an
answer for this question just a bit of
sympathy that I agree with you and I
will say that when I used to do videos
on products at Newegg I would be very
careful to take like a graphics card and
be like here is the angle that most of
you will be seeing the set so there's
there's a look at that right and
hopefully that was helpful for people
next question from NPC is kind of
related
why are GPUs not made with the fans up
and the PCB down that's very good
question been asked many times before
and just sort of kind of makes sense if
you look at a graphics card and you
assume hot air rises that's usually how
physics work you've got this solid plate
on top preventing any air from going
upwards and then you have all of the
cooling elements on the bottom with the
fans it would seem like it would kind of
make more sense to have that facing up
at least so the heat could escape and go
upwards here again I don't have a full
answer for you but hopefully I can
provide a bit of historical context to
maybe I can explain some reasons why so
this is the expansion card entry on
Wikipedia where it talks about expansion
cards in computers throughout history
and PCI Express is the one that we all
know and love right now because that's
what most of us are using there's also
PCI the predecessor to PCI Express
there's also a GP which is an expansion
slot standard specifically made for
graphics cards in about 1996 but petered
out in the mid to late 2000s because PCI
Express took over and there's then
there's even is a is a predates PCI and
ISA has these big long and slots in E if
they have really old motherboards and
then maybe you'll notice those an
interesting thing about ISA is from what
I can been reading in my research is a
card's actually had components on the
top of them if you look at the
orientation here where the slow
these are up on top it seems to be that
when they went from ISA to PCI they
switched that and they started putting
the components on the bottom of the card
rather than the top sorry my video froze
for a second there but back to the point
when they switched from the ISA to PCI
it seems like somebody somewhere along
the line made the decision that the
components should go on the bottom
instead of the top and that might have
made sense at the time because the CPU
is probably going to generate the most
heat in a computer at that time graphics
cards discrete graphics cards in
particular what really a thing at that
point so it wasn't until five to ten
years later that you suddenly had
massive graphics cards that required
more cooling expanding beyond a single
slot to two slots and then you have the
solution we have now which is an
established standard so that case
manufacturers motherboard manufacturers
and adding card manufacturers can all
produce products that will have
interoperability and work together
combined with this steady increase in
GPU power draw and heat generation that
has led to the solution that we have
today which is to and sometimes sleet
three slot cards that hang down below
the PCB in an orientation that doesn't
seem to make the most practical sense to
us as PC builders that said there are a
lot of cases that flip the script by
flipping the entire motherboard tray
upside down so you can do that if you
want to flip your graphics card upside
down of course then you have the CPU on
the bottom which introduces kind of a
different issue but then at least as the
previous commenter mentioned you can get
a good look at the actual functional
part of your graphics card which is
often what you see in the heads next
question is from Ben W he says I'm
considering getting 144 Hertz 1080p
monitors for my 1050 Ti so question
being can attend 50 T I pushed 1080 1920
by 1080 244 Hertz
second does g-sync demand more from the
GPU so switching from a non g-sync
standard 60 Hertz monitor to AG sync
monitor does that actually affect the
frame rate that your graphics card is
able to put out short answer is no your
graphics card can do a certain frame
rate if you have a 60 Hertz monitor you
either have vsync on which means it's
going to cap your frame rate to 60 or
you have vsync off which means it's
going to show you whatever frames are
there and you might have to deal with
some tearing if you take that same
configuration and plug it into a g-sync
monitor the monitor will simply display
every single frame there
GPU spits out and it will not have any
stuttering or tearing and it is overall
a better experience so to answer that
initial part of the question no G sync
on vs. G sync off will not affect the
framerate that your graphics card is
able to put out at all
second question 1050 TI with a 1080 144
Hertz monitor is very much going to
depend on the game you're playing if
you're playing a game that's two three
four years old and you have the settings
turned down a little bit you can
probably hit at 1920 by 1080 a very high
frame rate with a 1050 Ti again
depending on the game that you're
playing and again with a g-sync monitor
that monitor is just going to display up
to a hundred and forty-four frames per
second the exact amount of frames that
your graphics card is able to put out so
even if you can't hit 144 frames per
second or above with the game you're
playing and a 1050 Ti you still will get
a benefit even if your graphics card is
putting out 100 frames per second or 90
frames per second because it'll be
smoother you'll be seeing more frames
and you won't have any tearing that you
deal with with a typical graphics card
and monitor setup that said a jisuk
monitor is going to be very expensive so
you're gonna be spending a lot on the G
sync monitor compared to your 1050 Ti so
I would consider it more of an upgrade
path to the future get the monitor now
game on it for a while with your 1050 Ti
and then probably plan to upgrade that
temp of DTI at some point in the future
- next question for mark Andre P hey
Paul a game in my living room I've been
looking at HTPC cases are cases that lay
horizontally
that's pretty old-school remember when
computers used to lay on their side and
you put your monitor on top of them
there seems to be very few cases fewer
new designs and even fewer supporting
full ATX motherboards is this from lack
of demand they all seem overpriced for
such basic cases any recommendations and
yes you are triggering me if you keep
your PC on the floor especially like a
horizontal htpc style it's just there's
so much dust getting in there so build a
stand for whatever case you get but more
to the point though Silverstone is
generally my go-to for htpc style
horizontal HTPC cases this is just a
google image search of them and you can
see that they have lots of different
varieties although again they seems to
be fewer of these now than they used to
be in the past that's not to say that
there are none and if you go over to
Newegg and just look for Silverstone
cases you can see their vertical style
cases but you can also see some of their
more horizontal ish
cases if we scroll down this one's very
small so maybe less practical here's the
vital series SST VT 0 - that one also
looks very small if I actually search
for htpc here we we had only one actual
answer although I believe this is a
relatively new one the SST GD 0 for s it
does have USB 3 in the front this is not
full ATX though it's micro ATX but I
think you're right there are fewer of
these cases now than they used to be
cooling I think was not quite as
effective as these as in tower style
cases and there's just fewer people
doing DIY PC builds for a home theater
use because a lot of people just have a
DVR that they get from their cable
provider and then they just go with that
it's getting really hot in the garage
though so let me finish this video off
last month I talked about GPU sag and
quite a few people including Vladek 16
pointed out that Jay did a video
explaining another method to fix GPU sag
Brian actually pointed out the video
link and I've linked that in this
video's description too so feel free to
watch that but if you're interested in
the short story when you have GPU sag
like this it can often be helped by
providing further support to the
brackets at the back of the GPU and Jay
did that by basically taking a screw
screwing it in through the back of the
case to keep those from moving and that
greatly improved his GPU sag situation
so there's another solution for you guys
who might be looking for GPU sag that
doesn't work with every single case
though you have to have one that you can
actually access that point to screw
screw into but one final note if you
guys like sending me stuff feel free to
do so
Paul sigh we're peel box for three to
five Diamond Bar California if you guys
want to send me stuff we typically do
mail time and open packages during
awesome hardware our live show on
Tuesday evening so thanks to all you
guys who have sent me stuff there thanks
you guys for watching this video too and
thumbs up button and subscribe for more
content coming at you very soon
including some actually actual testing
on rakitin back there behind me thanks
again for watching guys we'll see you
