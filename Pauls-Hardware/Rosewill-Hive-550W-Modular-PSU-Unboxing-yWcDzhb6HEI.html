hardware today I'm going to be doing a
quick unboxing of this Rose wilheim
series 550 watt modular power supply so
let's take a closer look at the hive I'm
going to start off by removing the
plastic covering because otherwise all
you're gonna see is reflections alright
so talk about this first play when when
Rose will first brought me the hive
because this is been out for a little
while now I was a little skeptical I'll
admit it a little skeptical and after
sort of taking a look at it and I will
say more specifically after actually
hearing some of the reviews on it by
some of the review sites that I trust
it's actually a really good unit so I
think what Rose will did I think were
they were going for as I said okay let's
see the features that are wanted in a
power supply for a gaming computer or
any otherwise needed solid use computer
we want solid internals we want
efficiency so 80 plus bronze we want a
single 12 volt rail design because
although multi rail designs still work
perfectly fine a lot of times it's just
simpler to to work on a 12 volt rail a
single one and if you look it's
publicity at least a lot of times people
say well don't don't buy a multi rail
PSU that's not always necessarily the
case that that's a bad thing to have
multiple rails but it's it's not a bad
thing to have a single rail either so
that's what they've done here let's take
a quick look at the power charts on the
side this one here is for the 550 this
is for the 650 it's also available in
750 watts so you can see it's 12 volt
rail 38 amps on the 550 watt gives you
four hundreds 456 Watts total available
power on that 12 volt rail apart from
that you pee ready kind of goes along
with the efficiency here's a list of the
connectors that are included I'm going
to show you those as well when I get out
of the box so going back to I think rose
wills intent rose wills idea for this
PSU they want an 80 X 12 volt they want
a nice series of 80 plus bronze they
want to make them affordable of course
and this is definitely an affordable
PSU they wanted it modular which is
another very popular thing so the
modular design full-range active PFC eup
multi GPU support 135 millimeters silent
fan modular cable design high quality
Japanese primary capacitor over current
voltage temperature power and protection
under voltage protection and
short-circuit protection 3-year warranty
and one-to-one replacements so that was
that's all the all the gritty details
right there let's take a look inside the
box
here's your hive 80 plus bronze manual
alright contents I get your contents
repetition of stuff that was already on
the box easy troubleshooting there it is
alright so got your AC power of power
cable of course this is just basic basic
one they're got hundreds of those I
think I might have said fully modular at
the beginning if I did I apologize this
is mostly modular I for one don't really
care about mostly modular designs
because if the cables that are
permanently attached are the ones that
you're going to be using ninety-nine
times out of a hundred then make them
permanently attached I don't mind if I
had a choice I'll go for full modular
over partially modular but again I'm
keeping this thing within budget and the
more of these connectors on the back the
more those adds to the cost of the
design and everything alright so uh
apart from the documentation you get a
nice little pouch here with the mesh
side on one side so you can look at it
and see what it is
alright so here's a couple of your molex
connectors these are two individual
molex plugs either one has well let me
just untwist it I'm twisting okay
so two modular molex cables all right so
this one is uh two molex connectors in a
floppy connector this one okay they
exactly the same this one's also two
marks connectors in a floppy connector
this is two more here and then these are
for your video cards so PCI Express
power these are just one to one block so
block of eight the other side has your
six plus two so it can plug into either
a six pin or an eight pin PCI Express
fire connector on a video card what else
is in here all right look
well beg give a zip tie nice little
add-on looks like you get ten or so of
those with some black zip ties to help
you with your cable management that blog
get baggy down there is four of the
power supply mounting screws so you can
not the power supply to your case and
here are your other two modular cables
so these are both for your serial ATA
connectors for serial ATA powered
peripherals
so the side that plugs into the power
supply and over here you have four
serial ata connectors on that one and
four serial ata connectors on that one
so that gives you eight serial ata
overall and I believe four molex and too
floppy connectors finally of course the
permanently connected cables right there
and that is simply your twenty plus two
two pin or 24 pin main motherboard power
connector and your four plus four pin
either four or eight pin supplemental
CPU power connector and again I haven't
seen a computer in years that does not
use those so then being permanently
attached isn't a big deal there's a look
at the power chart again printed on the
power supply nothing on this side
nothing on this side
not much labeling here but I mean as
long as last is not something bright and
gaudy and it will just kind of blend in
with the black color that's the power
supplies otherwise made of it should
blend into most systems so there's your
hundred and thirty five millimeter fan
on that side
here's your fully grilled exhaust for
the back of the computer case input
there it's a switching power supply so
100 to 240 volt
on/off switch nice and solid and then of
course here on the back modular
connectors the black ones here for your
peripherals red ones there for a PCI
Express and all clearly labeled so very
nice and again now we'll see solid power
supply from Rose well once again we've
been taking a look at the Roseville High
of series 550 watt power supply thanks a
lot for watching this video guys
I'm Paulo false or if you would like to
go ahead and subscribe and we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
