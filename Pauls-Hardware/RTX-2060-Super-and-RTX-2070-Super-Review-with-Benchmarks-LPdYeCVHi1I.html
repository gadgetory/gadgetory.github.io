have a big old box from AMD with CPUs
and GPUs in them and I've set a bunch of
time aside to do testing this week so I
can bring you guys up to date detailed
information on the new products actually
one second gonna call coming in hello
Nvidia alright well screw all this stuff
I think I'll just work on this instead
so this isn't the first time this has
happened and it definitely won't be the
last time but the impending launch of
AMD 7 nanometer products both rise in
3000 series CPUs and the Navi based
Radeon 5000 series GPUs has spawned some
competition we're not expecting much
from Intel on the CPU side until later
this year but NVIDIA has stepped in with
today's launch of the Super versions of
our TX series graphics cards to give
AMD's still unreleased Navi cards a hard
time and hopefully if you're in videos
marketing department steal their thunder
now I can't say for sure if NVIDIA has
been planning this launch for a while or
if they've just had it in their back
pocket waiting for the next move from
Radeon technologies group but we have
known that AMD is launching on July
seventh 7/7 that's on Sunday by the way
for quite some time so NVIDIA slipping
in this launch of the RT X 2060 super
and 2070 super only five days before is
probably just coincidence there is an RT
X 2080 super on the way to by the way
we're just not quite sure of the launch
date for that yet
but let's try to look past the drama
between AMD and NVIDIA and focus on what
this GPU launch means for gamers at home
when it comes to the graphics cards
available to you in the mid to high-end
range are about 350 to 700 dollars so
I've done my best to quickly sum up the
changes with this handy chart you can
see the previous lineup and pricing next
to the updated lineup and pricing and
note that Nvidia is replacing the
existing RT X 2070 and RT X 2080 with
the new Super versions so the RT X 2060
will still be around and will cost 350
dollars the 2060 super will be $400 the
2070 super will be $500 and the 2080
super will be $700 so for the 2070 at
least this means that the founders
Edition and third-party versions will
start at the same price of 500
dollars which I like since that's less
confusing than having a founders
editions at 600 and normal versions that
are 500 and some special versions that
are still 600 the point being though
that non super Archie x20 70s and 20 80s
pretty much sucked now and they will be
gradually phased out but hey maybe that
means that you'll see some bargains on
them and then your future but honestly
who would even want a 20 70 that's not
super you that's gross but what's the
real difference specs wise and under the
hood apart from pricing the 2060 super
is still based on the TU 106 GPU but has
an increased core count from 1920 up to
2000 176 also expanded memory bus from
192 bit to 256 bit and 8 gigs of DDR 6
instead of 6 the memory is still running
at 14 gigabits per second but the
expanded bus ups the bandwidth to 448
gigabytes per second TVP is also
increased from a hundred and sixty watts
to 175 watts and although the base clock
is increased about hundred megahertz the
boost clock that's listed actually went
down from 1680 to 1650 but during
testing both of the cards the 2060
non-super and 2060 super ran at more
like 1850 to 1900 megahertz so that
really didn't have a huge impact the
2070 Super meanwhile has a core GPU
upgrade and is now based on the T 104
instead of the TU 106 like the original
2070 this means that the coup de coeur
count is bumped up to 2560 from the
previous 2,304 TVP is also up to 215
Watts formerly 175 this also means that
n vlink
SLI is now supported on the arc TX 2070
super and even though I don't usually
recommend a 2-way set up for mid-tier
cards I would rather have that option
than not so that's kind of a nice bonus
too we also have about a hundred and
fifty megahertz increase on the based
and boosts clocks for the 2070 from
reference there are also additional sm
units and texture units and pretty much
the same memory configuration with eight
gigs of GDD our six running at the same
speed
as for the r-tx 2080 super Nvidia is
still holding back on detailed info
apart from the price and that it exists
but they do say it will be faster than
the Titan XP that's big a little peak
and it will be replacing the existing
r-tx 2080
or $700 and yes again that means that
the founders edition won't have that
$100 price premium over third party
cards and now on to testing and let me
be direct I ran all of these tests fresh
and if we're being honest what you
really want to see in a comparison
benchmark is how these cards compare to
the new Radeon rx 50 750 700 XT but I
can't do that until Sunday
and I wasn't given a whole lot of time
to run these benchmarks since this
information came kind of late so today
we have an all Nvidia benchmark party
focusing on the performance of the new
super cards relative to the existing non
super RT X cards and come back on Sunday
if you'd like to see these numbers
updated with performance vs. team read
the test bet I'm using is based on an as
Roxy 390 Taichi ultimate motherboard and
an Intel Core i $9.99 hundred K running
at 4.8 gigahertz across all cores
it's cooled by the new Noctua Nhu 12 8
tower cooler the memory is a set of
g.skill royal RGB at 3600 mega Hertz
cast latency 16 and we're running
Windows 10 version 1903 which is
installed on a 512 gig Samsung 970 pro m
dot 2 nvme SSD we are powered by an EVGA
supernova g3 750 watt power supply and
these tests were run on an open testbed
not in a case just FYI
last thing to point out is that I do not
have a Founders Edition r-tx 27 t Nvidia
had third-party versions sampled back
when they were requiring both a $500 and
$600 version of the arc TX 2070 to be
sent to reviewers after some internal
debate I decided to just go ahead and
test with the MSI gaming zrt X 2070
which was originally $600 but the 2070
is are all going to be somewhat
normalized around the $500 price now
there's still going to be some more
expensive cards for third-party
manufacturers but it won't have that
$600 price from the founders Edition so
I'm pretty sure it is ok to classify
this as a $500 card going forward that
said here are your benchmarks
so there you have it guys it wasn't too
surprising to me but the 2060 super is
faster than the 2060 but slower than the
2070 the 2070 super is faster than a
2070 and actually comes pretty close to
the 2080 in some tests but still stays
in its lane without stepping on Big
Brother's toes too much of course I can
only imagine what this will mean for the
expected performance of the r-tx 2080
super let's look at some cumulative
numbers to get more specific though so
if you're moving from the r-tx 2060 to
the 2060 super you should expect about
13 percent better performance at 1080
about 16% better performance at 1440 and
about 18% better performance at 4k if
you're moving from an RT X 2070 to the
2070 super you should expect about 8.5
percent better performance at 1080 about
8.6 percent better performance of 1440
and about 9.2 percent better performance
at 4k and again this is comparing a
third-party overclocked r-tx 2070 to the
new founders edition RT X 2070 super now
I do still have more data that I have
gathered and I do have more to say about
these cards but I will be continuing my
analysis once I can speak more openly
about the navi cards that AMD still has
under embargo so for that reason I'm
keeping this video pretty simple and
maybe a little bit shorter what
questions can be answered for now though
there are a few first are the 2060 and
2070 super significantly faster than
their non super counterparts answer
would be yes by about 10 to 15 percent
based on my testing has Nvidia just
succeeded in juicing the performance of
their GPU lineup that will be compared
to Navi just days before na'vi launches
yes that's pretty sneaky of them do
consumers now have more GPUs to choose
from including several NVIDIA GPUs that
offer more performance for either the
same amount of money or even less money
if you're looking specifically at
founders Asian cards which you shouldn't
be but you can kind of look at it that
way anyway yes as well and I think
that's pretty much the note I'm going to
end this video on I do have more to come
very soon so don't forget to subscribe

thank you so much for watching hit the
thumbs up button on your way out and
we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
