today I'm bringing you an unboxing of a
brand new product from Asus
unfortunately I also have a plane to
catch to Taiwan in about like 36 hours
or so and I should probably pack too so
there's gonna be a quick unboxing a
first look but if you guys follow my
channel at all you might recognize the
sabre-tooth z77 that was probably one of
my favorite z77 boards that came out so
today I'm going to be showing you the
saber-tooth z87 so let's jump in we're
starting out with a closer look at the
box the saber-tooth is the 87 of course
features the new z87 chipset from Intel
as well as the 1150 socket for Intel's
fourth generation Core processors you
might more well know them as has well
this is part of the tough series so you
get a five-year warranty due to the
military class components and Asus
standing behind their work this one also
supports 2-way SLI and 3-way crossfire X
if you're into multi card configurations
on the back of the box you get a layout
of the board some detailed specs I'm
just gonna give a quick look at this if
you guys want to pause you can read over
them all individually
you also get thermal armor a tough
fortifier which I'll show in just a sec
the thermal radar - which gives you a
bunch of temperature read points on the
board as well as dust defender which is
essentially a bunch of plugs and caps
for all the ports on the board so that
you can keep dust out of them when
they're not in use inside the box you
have this tough bag which is a really
tough bag I suppose this is going to
include your dust defender parts also a
couple small fans that's for the thermal
armor they're optional you can or cannot
use them depending on your configuration
if you want to keep them cool and don't
worry they don't spend to fast and in my
experience they stay pretty quiet you
also get a dust defender filter of
course all those caps for your USB your
video outs and then also your rear panel
IO also dust defender caps for your PCI
Express and your DIMM slots some 1x
shorter ones four PCI Express fan slot
covers and also there are your PCI
Express 16x
covers also you get some Thermal radar
temperature sensors these are on cables
so you can kind of place them remotely
wherever you might want to in your case
you get a black Q connector very nice
should blend in much better or not stand
out quite as much as the white Q
connectors we've seen in the past you
also get a USB header an SLI bridge you
get an IO shield this black in color all
the i/os are labeled you get some
squishy electrostatic discharge
shielding on the back there as well and
then you also get a software and driver
disk of course best to download the
latest ones of these from the Asus
website you're gonna get an accessory
installation guide this one's just to
sort of guide you through using the dust
defender parts and then you're going to
get a user guide which is kind of a
pretty standard user's guide with lots
info about the board
rounding out the accessories you get a
tough inside sticker to place wherever
you want a place of sticker certificate
of reliability that's for the military
class caps chokes and MOSFETs on the
board and of course SATA cables you get
four of them and I like that they've
actually given you a couple with
straight plugs on both ends and a couple
with straight plugs and then to a ninety
degree angled plugs and onto the
motherboard itself you will notice the
tough themes showing right through if
you've ever looked at one of the Asus
tough series motherboards in the past
they typically feature military colors
in this case you got black silver some
brown and some tan on the slots also a
few green highlights as well you will
notice the black plastic Thermal Armor
that's a cover it's going to protect the
components on the board it's also going
to allow you to channel airflow more
directly specifically over a lot of the
power delivery components on the board
or on that in just a moment you're also
going to get the tough fortifier it's a
metal backplate so you've probably seen
back plates on video cards and now you
got one on a motherboard it's got the
very clever we got your back text right
on there this is gonna provide some
extra rigidity for the board some more
sturdiness it also gives a nice little
feature that just lets you set the board
down on a flat surface without having to
worry about actually dinging the surface
you're setting it on or damaging any of
the components on the board which I I
found to be very handy yeah it looks
pretty cool too you'll notice a little
bit of texture on the tough fortifier
and it's also spaced out a little bit
from the PCB and that's gonna allow some
hair to flow back there because the back
of the motherboard does get warm too you
will notice Thermal Armor vents this is
a back on the front with the plastic
thermal armor those are called flow
valves by ASUS you can flip them open or
close and again that's going to let you
channel the air or block it depending on
your configuration and whether or not
you have the little fans installed next
up the PCI Express 3.0 area you'll
notice all of these slots you get three
x1 slots and then you get three
full-sized phisically 16x slots and
Haswell processors at least most of the
high-end ones are going to have 16 PCI
Express 3.0 lanes if you have a single
card installed it'll run at 16 X on that
top slot you can also do an 8 X + 8 X
configuration that'll be for a two-way
SLI or crossfire X and then you do have
3-way crossfire X support and that all
the full length slots will run it 8 4 &amp;amp;
4 if you actually populate all three of
them for SATA over on the side you have
a bunch of SATA revision 3 6 gigabits
per second ports available from the z87
chipset that's native those are the
brown ports that you see right there and
those being native means they're gonna
be very fast
you also get raid support raid 0 1 5 &amp;amp;
10 so if you need to plug in a bunch of
SSDs you're gonna be all set these also
support Intel's
Smart Response and rapid start
technology he also noticed a couple tan
ports right there those are actually
from an add-on as media chip also say to
Rev 3 6 gigabits per second and speaking
of add-on as media chips there's also a
couple eSATA 3 ports available on the
back also from as media add-on ship you
also probably spot a green at right
angle port right there that's USB 3.0
and that's another great feature is the
87 you get native a USB 3.0 six of those
available two of them will be available
from that right angle header along the
bottom edge you'll notice some
additional headers a USB 2.0 got some
front panels you got chassis fan headers
two four pin ones down there speaking of
chassis fan headers you also get three
more fan headers at the top edge that
are also four pin a couple for a CPU and
then one more for chassis you also have
the direct key but
life to immediately access the UEFI also
an audio front panel header and then we
will move on to the ddr3 dimms slots
this is dual channel of course just like
you might have noticed for Sandy Bridge
or Ivy Bridge dual channel so they color
coded by your sticks in sets of two
supports up to 32 gigs of memory of
course also supports Intel's
XMP or extreme memory profiles and
officials 1866 speed support from Intel
you can also go for overclock speeds
beyond that if you so desire to the left
of the DIMM slots we have the 1150
socket that's going to be for your
fourth generation has well processor not
backwards compatible don't drop an Ivy
Bridge or Sandy Bridge processor in
there now you get military class power
delivery components you'll see them
peeking out there underneath the thermal
armor they look quite nice I got some
logos on them you can see some of the
chokes and caps right there laid out a
very very tantalizingly that's for your
power delivery and finally we will close
with the rear i/o so here you have the
rest or the forum or if a USB 3.0 also
natively supported by z87 chipset these
all I should mention including that
front panel hider support isus USB 3.0
boost which gives you markedly improved
USB 3.0 transfer speeds also for USB 2.0
ports you'll see a little gap there and
that's for the thermal armor fan if you
do install that it'll give some
ventilation for that I get an hdmi and
displayport for the IGP you and your
Haswell processor you got an Intel NIC
you get an optical Toslink and audio ins
and outs and that's for your integrated
ru and that is gonna wrap it up for this
quick unboxing and overview video guys
and what I'd like to hear from you is
what kind of more in-depth coverage
you'd like to see of this board or of
other boards from the Asus is the 87
line because I have access to a couple
of them right now and I'd love to sort
of dig into the BIOS perhaps maybe some
of the extra features that Asus is added
on whether you're talking software
hardware based so please leave me a
comment in the comment section below let
me know what you'd like me to do with
this board
apart from plugging it in and using it
of course and I'll be sure to follow up
and try to bring you guys as much of
that coverage as I possibly can but
then I'm going away to Taiwan for a
couple weeks I'll be reporting from
Computex so you can find that coverage
on our new ik TV YouTube channel
actually by the time this video goes up
chances are I will already have been
there and will already be posting so
check out our YouTube channel I'm sure
on there doing crazy stuff in Taiwan but
that's all for this one I guess
subscribe if you liked the video like
the video if you thought it was useful
and I'll see you all in Taiwan</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
