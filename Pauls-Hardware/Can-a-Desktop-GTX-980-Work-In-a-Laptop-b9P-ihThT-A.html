Hills California it's a very nice place
it's very high a classy and all that
good stuff but I was invited here by
Nvidia and I came along with Logan and
Kane from tech syndicate and the reason
I was invited was because they basically
took a gtx 980 full-size desktop
discrete GPU and they've they've taken
these things and they've developed a way
to put them into a laptop that is what
this video is all about a gtx 980 full
size not a 980 m with the mobile thing
and all that kind of cut down nonsense
on it but a full 980 and a laptop so I
had like three main questions about it
when they first introduced it the first
one of course was performance is the
performance the same on a desktop and a
laptop if you have a 980 in both let's
find out here's a quick 3d 3d mark test
comparison right here we have a system
with 4770k and a full size GTX 980 and
it scores on 3d mark this is firestrike
standard 11250 for graphic score for
thirteen thousand five hundred and sixty
one coming right over here to our cleveo
which is also using a full-size desktop
GPU however it's in a laptop and that's
the difference and if you don't believe
us that they're actually the same GPU
look at the scores 11 thousand 468
graphics core of 13424 a little bit of
difference in the overall score because
they are using different CPUs but that's
that's a 980 in a laptop that's the
performance the synthetic test wasn't
enough so running an actual game here
this is shadow of Mordor
again looking at the results from the
980 in the laptop from cleveo average of
ninety point nine six frames per second
a minimum of 60 frames per second which
is gtx 980 performance and the same test
over here on the full-size GPU got an
average of pretty much within margin of
error average of 91 minimum of 62 so
again you have a full-size desktop
laptop desktop GPU
okay so clearly it's a 980 and a laptop
and I was pretty impressed
next up though they were talking about
overclocking you can overclock the GPU
just like you might overclock a desktop
GPU and this is another thought that I
had as far as the GPU frequency because
I was like well they took a 980 and they
put it in a laptop to cry after like
underclock it and all this kind of stuff
but despite my hesitation I think they
actually got beyond my expectations and
were able to overclock it to like 1,300
to 1,400 megahertz range let's take a
look at that so just to prove that
overclocking is just the same as well Oh
see it's just like overclocking on a
desktop now we're actually pushing this
far beyond its limits we were getting
towards about the 1400 megahertz range
but it's easily achieving 1,300 to 1350
and it's just like every overclocking on
a desktop basically you set yourself an
offset get yourself a higher GPU
frequency you can bump up the memory
frequency as well this is running on an
MSI laptop that were showing you the
demo of here of course and it's running
the Unigine in heaven benchmark in the
background as we fool around with the
overclocking settings now this laptop is
set up in the max fan mode we wanted to
cool the GPU off a lot and see kind of
what max overclocked we can get so right
now it's 1350 to is what it's at this
was staying pretty consistent if you
want not quite as much power you can of
course turn down the fans a little bit
adjust that to get yourself that nice
little sweet spot between performance
and noise generated by the fans for the
cooling so this is all very well and
exciting and an idea popped in my head
after I was shown it and because we did
some VR demos when we were PAX Prime you
guys might've seen him on some of our
coverage there and I like oh you could
take one of these laptops with the 980 s
in it and like strap it to your back and
use it for VR and walk around with VR
well that may be something that's coming
in the future but they actually did want
to show us a VR demo so that's actually
right over here behind me Kane did a
little tester on it he was playing Eve
Valkyrie and this is actually the same
game that we tested at PAX Prime playing
on a full-size desktop 980ti
and Kane said based on his experience it
was almost pretty much undifferenced
that's a that's a word on different
can degrees so a Valkyrie is up and
running of course there's going to be
more VR demos coming on the challenge of
rendering VR is a lot more in-depth than
say rendering a typical 1080 image on
screen it's actually something in the
range of about five times it's intense
on the GPU side so bringing a full-size
desktop 980 to a laptop this is going to
let you do your VR on the go and I
imagine there's a lot of other
applications as well maybe integrating
it it's a little tiny computers like
nooks or brick systems or something like
that
there's Oh taxi boxes I'm sure going to
get some of these but they did have some
actual hardware demos of course they
have the demos that we were playing on
here and it has some laptops that are
coming out they've been working with a
lot of the different laptop system
integrators so we saw for instance the
msi gt80 which has a full mechanical
keyboard in Cherry MX browns which is
this time around which I was very happy
about so is gain and then they also had
the the two not one but two gtx 980 s so
in sli 980 is in sli and a laptop pretty
insane also we saw the new Asus laptop
it was just a test unit so it wasn't up
and running but it has a full water
cooling assembly on the back of it so
inside the laptop it has basically a
liquid cooling arrangement so you got
blocks I believe on the CPU and the GPU
that's in there but if you pull the
laptop off there's quick disconnects in
the back so you can take a laptop with
you on the go and it has an air cooling
solution that will work or when you get
home and you want a game you pop it on
that quick disconnects connect and then
the water cooling loop starts up your
temperatures drop on your 980 that's in
there and that of course GPU boost takes
care of the rest get to much higher
frequencies and then you can game much
more better I like using that phrase
much more better anyway if you guys
thought this was a much more better
video than any of the other ones I've
done and hit the like button if you
think it's a pretty standard video also
hit the like button if you think it's
sucked then just stop watching right now
and I'm subscribed to my channel thank
you for watching this video though
thanks to Nvidia for inviting us out
here thanks to a Logan and Kane for
hanging out with me and I think
especially thanks to Logan for holding
the camera right now he's doing a great
job and he's not wearing pants anything
I don't know how have I not looked I'll
see you next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
