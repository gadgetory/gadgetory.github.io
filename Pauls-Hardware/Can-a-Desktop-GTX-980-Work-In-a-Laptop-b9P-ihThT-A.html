beverly hills california it's a very
nice place it's very high a classy and
all that good stuff but i was invited
here by nvidia and I came along with
Logan and Kane from tech syndicate and
the reason I was invited was because
they basically took a gtx 980 full-size
desktop discrete GPU and they've they've
taken these things and they've developed
a way to put them into a laptop that is
what this video is all about a gtx 980
full-size not the nine ATM with the
mobile thing and all that kind of cut
down nonsense on it but a full 980 and a
laptop so I had like three main
questions about it when they first
introduced it the first one of course
was performance is the performance the
same on a desktop and a laptop if you
have a 980 in both let's find out he's a
quick 3d 3d mark test comparison right
here we have a system with 4770k and a
full-sized gtx 980 and it scores on 3d
mark this is a fire strike standard
11,000 250 for graphics core for 13,000
561 coming right over here to our clevo
which is also using a full-size desktop
GPU however it's a in a laptop that's
the difference and if you don't believe
us that they're actually the same GPU
look at the score is 11,000 468 graphics
core of 13,000 424 a little bit of
difference in the overall score because
they are using different CPUs but that's
that's a 980 and a laptop that's the
performance the synthetic test wasn't
enough so running an actual game here
this is shadow of mordor again looking
at the results from the 980 in the
laptop from clevo average of 90.9 6
frames per second a minimum of 60 frames
per second which is GTX 980 performance
and the same test over here on the
full-size GPU got an average of pretty
much within margin of error average of
91 minimum of 62 so again you have a
full-size desktop laptop desktop GPU
little app
okay so clearly it's a 980 and a laptop
I I was pretty impressed next up though
they were talking about overclocking you
can overclock the GPU just like you
might overclock a desktop GPU and this
is another thought that I had as far as
the GPU frequency because I was like
well they took a 980 and they put in a
laptop the crafter like underclock it
and all this kind of stuff but despite
my hesitation I think they actually got
beyond my expectations and were able to
overclock it to like 1300 to 14 hundred
megahertz range let's take a look at
that so just prove that overclocking is
just the same as well Oh see it's just
like overclocking on a desktop now we're
actually pushing this far beyond its
limits we were getting towards about the
14 hundred megahertz range but it's
easily achieving 1313 50 and it's just
like every overclocking on a desktop
basically you set yourself an offset get
yourself a higher GPU frequency you can
bump up the memory frequency as well
this is running on an msi laptops that
were shown you the demo of here of
course and it's running the engine
heaven benchmark in the background as we
fooled around with the overclocking
settings now this laptop is set up in
the max fan mode we wanted to cool the
GPU off a lot and see kind of what max
overclocked we can get so right now it's
1352 is what it's at this was saying
pretty consistent if you want a not
quite as much power you can of course
turn down the fans a little bit adjust
that to get yourself that nice little
sweet spot between performance and noise
generated by the fans for the cooling so
this is all very well and exciting and
an idea popped in my head after I was
shown it and because we did some VR
demos when we were at PAX Prime you guys
might have seen him on some of our
coverage there and I was like oh you
could take one of these laptops with the
nine 80s in it and like strap it to your
back and use it for VR and walk around
with VR well that may be something
that's coming in the future but they
actually did want to show us a VR demo
so that's actually right over here
behind me Kane did a little tester on it
he was playing eve valkyrie and this is
actually the same game that we tested at
PAX Prime playing on a full-size desktop
980 TI and Kane said based on his
experience it was almost pretty much
kane degrees so a Valkyrie is up and
running of course there's going to be
more VR demos coming on the challenge of
rendering VR is a lot more in-depth than
say rendering a typical 1080 image on
screen it's actually something in the
range of about five times its intense on
the GPU side so bringing a full-size
desktop 982 a laptop is going to let you
do your VR on the go and I imagine
there's a lot of other applications as
well maybe integrating it if it's a
little tiny computers like nooks or
brick systems or something like that the
zotac zbox is I'm sure going to get some
of these but they did have some actual
hardware demos of course they have the
demos that we were playing on here and
it has some laptops that are coming out
they've been working with a lot of the
different laptop system integrators so
we saw for instance the MSI gtat which
has a full mechanical keyboard in Cherry
MX Browns which is this time around
which I was very happy about so his cane
and then they also had the the two not
one but two gtx 980 s so in sli 980 is
an sli and a laptop pretty insane also
we saw the new asus laptop it was just a
test unit so it wasn't up and running
but it has a full water cooling assembly
on the back of it so inside the laptop
it has basically a liquid cooling
arrangement so you got blocks I believe
on the CPU end the GPU that's in there
but if you pull the laptop off there's
quick disconnects in the back so you can
take a laptop with you on the go and it
has an air cooling solution that will
work or when you get home and you want a
game you pop it on that quick
disconnects connect and then the water
cooling loop starts up your temperatures
drop on your 980 that's in there and
then of course GPU boost takes care of
the rest get too much higher frequencies
and then you can game much more better I
like using that phrase much more better
anyway if you guys thought this was a
much more better video than any of the
other ones I've done and hit the like
button if you think it's a pretty
standard video also hit the like button
if you think it's sucked then just stop
watching right now and I'm subscribe to
my channel thank you for watching this
video though thanks to Nvidia for
inviting us out here thanks to a Logan
and Kane for hanging out with me and
especially thanks to Logan for holding
the cam right now he's doing a great job
and he's not wearing pants I know
I don't know how have I not looked Oh
see you next time guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
