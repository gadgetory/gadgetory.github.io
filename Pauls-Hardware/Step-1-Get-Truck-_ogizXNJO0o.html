where I did a bunch of cleaning and
organizing in my garage and my house and
one of the things that I spotted that I
needed to find something good to do with
was my old laptop my g73 j RG laptop
from Asus I've had for a very long time
it's done so much good work for me
but Jenny recently contacted me and said
hey I had my laptop die and I was like
awesome I have a good home for this so
Jenny's in Las Vegas you may recall me
actually traveling and delivering her a
computer in the past I was gonna ship
the laptop and then I thought to myself
you know what maybe there's another
option completely unrelated I have been
kind of wanting a trek lately
largely to do a lot of work on the house
that I've been talking about that I
mentioned on the channel and being able
to go and get large pallets of wood and
that kind of things very convenient also
I like trucks I used to have one I don't
anymore
so I started looking for the truck I
wanted and specifically I decided not to
go to Tacoma
I wanted a manual of v6 and a few other
specifics and specifically the manual
was very hard to find I had to look
nationwide pretty much an eventually I
found one in Colorado so specifically
found the truck I wanted at Barbies
freeway Ford in Boulder sorry in Denver
Colorado and the past couple days worked
out financing with my credit union and
booked a flight yesterday flew out this
morning on a very early flight at about
five o'clock a.m. I actually it was a
very inexpensive ticket it was all about
hundred twenty four dollars to fly
United I used their super budget package
which meant I wasn't allowed to bring in
a full-size carry-on or whatever but it
was fine they treated me like a human
and I didn't have to like I even got a
window seat which was nice
so are you pretty uneventful and quick
to our flight this morning a quick walk
through the airports a quick lift ride
over to the dealership and I got my new
truck all happened very quickly but now
I'm on my way back to California I'm
attempting to do this entire trip and
one day because I have nothing else to
do at the time besides Drive and listen
to music I
I'm gonna make a little video of it -
and that's what you guys are watching
right now hopefully this intro hasn't
taken you too long to get to where we're
at
there's my new truck it's probably
pretty windy right now so I'm not sure
how good you can hear me but it's gray
and I didn't even know it was gonna have
the shell on the back that just kind of
came with it but I had to scoop it up
quick cuz the few of these that I found
have disappeared very quickly
apparently it's as sought after vehicle
and that pretty much brings you guys up
to speed I am now traveling the 14 hours
or so the drive from Denver Colorado all
the way back to Southern California I'm
driving along the 70 freeway
here's through Colorado the Rocky
Mountains is a beautiful partially
cloudy day there's snow on the mountains
it's actually looking kind of wintry
here - which is pretty cool but I'm
gonna get back on the road I have a lot
of driving left to do I'll stop from
time to time to stretch my legs
share some of the scenery with you guys
and and and I hope you enjoy it it's
quite beautiful here in Colorado
I stopped to stretch my legs by White
River I'm pretty sure this is White
River we're near hanging lake and I'm
not sure there's also something with the
Grizzlies staying here I'm not feeling
very safe but I'm not sure painting Lake
is the lake is hanging or they hang
people there or if you just hang out
there by the way I'm gonna get back down
the road
can I get one chicken and soft taco one
spicy potato soft taco
so I just crossed the Colorado River and
things are starting to look let's move
to this and more desert II I'm almost to
you Tom
also USC is winning the football game
against Colorado very appropriate and I
seem to have discovered bug country
ah
stop to clean that up
that made my way to Las Vegas you can
tell cuz the gas station is apparently
owned by terrible's actually at the
Chevron look I'm getting gas again
that's super exciting on the plus side
I'm almost to Jenny's and I get to fly
my hand off this laptop that's it's a
whole reason I'm doing all this right
look it's Jenny's house it's a really
cool house in Las Vegas I really like
her fireplace Jenny's here
hi Jenny I like rolled in on her at
10:00 at night so she made me promise
that's put her in the video very much
but there sagen there so we dug and then
this max down here max thanks are you
camera shy boy yeah good boy max don't
he's so good he's good he deserves a
treat yeah he brought me his favorite
toy just just a few minutes ago that was
pretty awesome
so the g73 J there it is and I told me
she has to promise to give me the SSD
that's in there like years from now cuz
it's a it's a C 300 and it's a good SSD
but also she's getting the upper key
beacon backpack because this this laptop
is so big it only actually fits in like
a couple of different backpacks so
there's that and then like this is like
it's carrying around all day today this
is their power brick be happy that power
bricks aren't this big anymore so guys
mission accomplished thanks Paul of
course Thank You Jenny for letting me
stop by your place okay htpc yeah this
is beginning a tradition really
convoluted means of delivering Jenny a
new computer but I'm gonna hit the road
and head home I've only got four more
hours to drive I do have a full think
against this so wish me luck
so as I drove on it got dark as it
usually does at nights and I got less
and less good at making video of my
journey that's okay because I don't
think any of my video that I made of my
trip was all that great anyway but
that's okay because I was driving and I
was mad as my focus was driving I'm back
though I'm back in California I got my
truck here so I made it home safe
Saturday was a very very long day I did
make it to Las Vegas briefly met with
Jenny a guys probably saw that handed
off the laptop and then drove the rest
of the way home made it home by about
2:00 a.m. so about 4:00 a.m. was when I
got up and left home to a.m. was when I
came back so I guess it's about 22 our
trip to get my truck bring it back here
but I'm super happy with it so far it's
a work truck it's got some wear and tear
on it but low miles powerful engine
manual transmission it also has manual
transmission of course that was snow ski
but yeah this is the end of this video I
don't know if anything else to say so
this has been a random weird video but
I'm gonna use my truck to do lots of
things now and thanks for watching
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it
we'll see you back soon with actual tech
videos again and not just me driving
across Colorado in Utah thanks for
watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
