Hardware today's video is going to be a
beginner's guide on building a gaming
computer for about $500 so let's get
started a desktop PC is made up from
seven different parts a processor or CPU
which will often come with a heat sink
fan for cooling in the box a case to
hold everything and protect the parts
inside as well as providing some airflow
a motherboard which everything plugs
into memory that holds on to data the
computer needs quickly and at least one
storage drive like a SSD your hard drive
for permanent data storage a power
supply to supply power and if it wants
to be a gaming PC almost always a
dedicated graphics card now this video
is about building the desktop computer
itself so if you're using this as a
guide bear in mind that apart from these
seven components you would still need an
operating system to install like Windows
10 you can get it cheap via the video
link in the card up there are
peripherals as well like a mouse
keyboard and monitors so factor in
another 100 to 150 dollars if you need
to buy those too and I'll link to some
suggestions for those parts down in the
description for my CPU I have an Intel
Core i3 6100 it's a dual core with hyper
threading so it can pretend to be a
quad-core the motherboard is an asrock v
150 m pro 4 v it suck at 11:51 so that
matches the cpu and I spent twelve four
dollars for this board instead of the be
150 M HDB that I picked out in the
monthly builds video this is all based
on because it has 4 memory slots instead
of 2 and also an m2 slot in there that
you can add a fast SSD in the future
with if you want to the case is a
fractal core 1100 a budget micro ATX
sized case at $40 it will get the job
done for storage I have a 240 gig SSD it
is a sand disc but very comparable speed
wise to the a data one from the original
parts list and although I highly
recommend an SSD for your operating
system one of the first things that you
might add to this build is going to be
more storage ideally you can maybe
salvage a 1 terabyte or so hard drive
from your old computer that is
definitely recommended just a single 8
gigabyte ddr4 stick from memory that is
another easy future upgrade would be to
just add another 8 gig stick in the
future for dual channel and 16 gigs also
embarrassing mistake here I accidentally
grabbed an incompatible g.skill DDR
three memory stick for some of this
video that I was going to use before I
realize my mistake and I ended up
switching to an 8 gig corsair ddr4 stick
the video card is a gigabyte Radeon rx
460 with 4 gigs of video memory a great
starter card for 130 dollars and also an
easy part to upgrade down the line the
power supply was supposed to be an EVGA
450 watt unit but so if you're wondering
why there's a 700 watt power supply here
and a 450 watt power supply in the
description well I ordered the forum 50
watt and Amazon sent me a 700 watt
plastic on the outside of it had a
sticker with a boardroom 50 watt label
on it too so I mean that's what I paid
for but is what I got at anyway for the
purposes of this video the 700 watt unit
will work just as well
those are my components though and for
tools I'm also going to keep it simple
with a standard Phillips head
screwdriver scissors and a rubber mat to
set delicate components on oh and later
on I realized they also needed some
pliers so here's everything unboxed and
laid out onto the table apart from each
item itself I have the box of
accessories that came with the case the
power cord and four screws that came
with the power supply the heat sink fan
that came with the CPU and the
motherboard manual IO shield and SATA
cable that came with the motherboard the
power supply supplies power via these
cables to the rest of the computer it
will plug in directly to your storage
the SSD as well as the graphics card and
a couple places on the motherboard and
if you're concerned about static
electricity and take the three prong
plug from your power supply and plug it
into a grounded outlets and then just
touch the housing that will ground you
and then you'll be safe to touch other
components so let's get the motherboard
ready to go by installing the CPU and
memory carefully open the CPU socket on
the motherboard by pushing the lever arm
down and out away from the socket then
lift the lid there's a triangle on the
corner of the CPU that you should align
with the triangle that's on the socket
as well as the socket cover remember to
never touch the gold contacts on the
bottom of the CPU or those pins in the
socket they are very delicate hold the
CPU by its edges line up those gold
triangles and with the contacts facing
down lower the CPU on to the socket bear
carefully there are also two notches
along the edges of the CPU that will
help align in the socket
once it's in don't push down just give
it a very light jiggle to make sure it's
settled and then close the socket lid
then push down the lever all the way
back into place and note that it might
take a little bit of pressure to do that
the socket cover will pop off and the
CPU is installed next we'll install the
stock CPU heatsink fan which has some
thermal paste pre applied to help it
transfer heat from the CPU
don't touch that thermal paste like I
did just line up the four plastic
mounting plugs with the four holes
around the CPU socket keep it level and
push those pins in starting with
opposite corners once it's secure plug
the fan in it connects to the four pin
CPU fan header next is memory I have one
stick and four slots and the manual
doesn't really say which slot to use for
a single stick oh well it's fine I'm
just going to go with the outer one and
it is easy to move a stick of memory if
it doesn't happen to work fYI it did the
memory sticks have a notch in the middle
that's just off sensor so just make sure
you've got it flip the right way open
the side latch of the DIMM slot and then
drop the memory straight in apply firm
even pressure straight down on top of
the memory stick and it should snap into
place
closing the latch okay let's set the
motherboard CPU and memory assembly
aside for a moment and work on the case
in power supply remove the case side
panels and the vertical drive mount
that's right up at the front and prep
the power supply by unbundling just the
cables that we need those are the 24 pin
and 8 pin plugs for the motherboard and
the SATA power connector for an SSD note
that the eight pin is labeled CPU and
should not be confused with these six
plus two pin connectors for graphics
cards which we won't be using in this
build they are keyed again so you can't
plug them in wrong unless you really
force them but watch out for that bundle
all the unused cables up so you can
shove them in the drive bays at the top
of the case and then drop in the power
supply and secure it with the four
screws from the back while you're at it
finish off that case prep by removing
these upper two white expansion slot
covers remember there's no shame in
using a screw driver for a stuck thumb
screw and grab the i/o shield that came
with the motherboard and pop that into
the rectangle opening below the power
supply use the butt end of a screwdriver
to pop that into place if it's given you
any trouble next you'll want motherboard
standoffs so gather eight of these from
the case accessories as well as eight
screws
of the proper threading to go in each
standoff you can just test outside of
the case your motherboard should have
eight mounting holes that corresponds
with the mounting points in the case
itself I like to really secure my
standoffs to the case so I used pliers
here to tighten them down so they
wouldn't come loose if I ever take the
system apart now we can drop in the
motherboard CPU and memory assembly
angle the i/o into the case first and
make sure you have all of your standoffs
in the right place once it's settled I
missed one here
but I just had to pull the motherboard
out move the standoff to the right spot
and then everything was good to go once
you're sure everything is lined up and
that there's no standoffs anywhere where
they shouldn't be secure the motherboard
with your eight screws and remember
these do not need to be tight just snug
now comes the fun part of plugging all
those cables into the motherboard
starting with the 24 pin and eight pin
power supply cables these are keyed so
they'll only go in one way and there's a
latch on one side of the plug that will
engage with the catch on the motherboard
side plug and if they do require some
extra pushing especially for that 24 pin
make sure to get your hand down there
and support the underside of the
motherboard as you push it in the rest
of these cables our front panel plugs
from the case they're needed so that the
power button and USB ports up there will
work by far the most annoying are the
front panel power reset and LED plugs as
they are tiny and they need to connect
two equally tiny pin outs on the
motherboard and just reference the
manual to see what goes where remember
that for the LED plugs you will need to
pay attention to what's positive and
negative but for these switches the
on/off you won't that doesn't matter
also just FYI this case does not have a
reset button so those pins on the
motherboard won't be used this case has
one fan with a free pin plug that plugs
into the chassis fan plug on the
motherboard and then finally you've got
the USB 2.0 USB 3.0 and front panel
audio the USB 2 and audio plugs are
similar but they are again keyed
differently so you can't mix them up
when you're plugging them in and each of
these has a specific spot to plug it
into on the motherboard and they're all
labeled while you can reach them now is
a good time to tidy up some of these
cables upfront just try to gather them
together in sort of a neat ish bundle
with twist tire too and keep them away
from blocking that front intake fan by
the way if you're going to be using
twist ties make sure that they're in
good shape with no metal showing that
could cause a short nearly finished now
storage and GPU are all that's left so
grab the SATA data
that we set aside and plug one end into
the SATA port on the motherboard their
l-shaped and they only go in one way
I used SATA port 1 although any of those
SATA ports 1 through 6 can be used the
SSD can be mounted to the inside of this
vertical drive mount and I'm going to
use four small screws to do that I
pointed the drives plugs towards the
front of the case in order to hide those
cables the short plug gets the SATA data
cable that you just plugged into the
motherboard the long plug gets the SATA
power plug that should already be ready
and waiting from the power supply and
then the drive mount panel can be
reinstalled with v3 screws and finally
we have the video card it has a long PCI
Express connector on the bottom which
also has a notch close to its bracket
line this up with the PCI Express slot
on the motherboard that is closest to
the CPU and the graphics card should
drop into place with just a bit of firm
pressure there is a catch on the
motherboard slot that you might need to
slide over to the unlock position to
install and then back into the lock
position once the GPU is in secure the
back bracket with the two thumb screws
and you're finished with the build part
at least but don't put the side panels
back on until you've tested it that's
bad luck plug in your PSU power cable
you could also connect the monitor mouse
and keyboard at this point turn on the
power supply and hit that power button
and your system should spring to life
with fans spinning and I guess just fans
spinning for now if you didn't plug in a
monitor like me if it doesn't spin up it
usually means that you have a short
somewhere or that something isn't
plugged in all the way so start by going
through those connections and see if you
missed something or maybe like the
graphics card isn't see it or something
like that so that's how you build this
little computer but what's next well
you'd want to do some basic system setup
and install an operating system like
Windows 10 and I have a follow-up video
coming on that very soon you might also
be considering upgrades this build has a
lot of headroom for that which I will
also be doing an upcoming video on and
you'd probably also want to see how the
system actually performs and you guessed
it I have a video coming up on that soon
too in the meantime though I hope this
video helps you and your PC building
