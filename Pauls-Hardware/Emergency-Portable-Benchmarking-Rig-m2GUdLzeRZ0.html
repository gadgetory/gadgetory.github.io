Paul's hardware this is a quick video
about a system that I set up for a very
specific purpose but if you're watching
this video I'm actually not here anymore
or least not here at home I have some
traveling coming up and I was thinking
you know planning the travels and we're
gonna stay and the things I'm gonna seem
very excited you're actually gonna be in
Europe for a little bit but I had this
thought occurred to me which is what if
I need to benchmark while I'm traveling
so I've built an emergency portable
benchmarking rig the master case each
500 M by Coolermaster sports dual Tour
de millimeter addressable RGB fans a USB
3.1 gen2 type-c port and four tempered
glass side panels both sides top and
front and the front can swap out for a
mesh panel if you want maximum airflow
it has a plethora of cable routing
covers to keep things tidy too so click
the sponsor link in the description to
learn more so here's the system it is
set up and functional but I wanted to
point out that this video is gonna be
pretty lightweight I'm just gonna kind
of go over the parts and maybe some of
the initial testing that I've done
because as mentioned I'm about to start
traveling in fact in just a couple hours
I am headed to the airport so I'm a bit
of a time constraint I set the system up
yesterday though so let's quickly go
over the parts I wanted the system to be
very good at benchmarking graphics cards
so whereas a lot of the builds I've done
recently I have geared towards AMD
because I feel they provide you a lot of
bang for the buck and a nice balance
between CPU performance and gaming
performance if you want to get the most
out of a graphics card right now you're
probably gonna want to go with Intel's
mainstream platform so to that end I
have a 8700 K CPU and my humble opinion
probably the best CPU for testing
graphics cards right now if you want to
get the most performance out of them
perhaps maybe the 8086 would be a good
option as well but if you overclock in
8700 K it's basically the same as in
8086 anyway to house this processor
though and keep everything portable I
wanted Mini ITX om and I wanted Z 370 to
enable overclocking and preferably a
higher-end board to make sure that you
know I have some bells and whistles in
there make sure I can maintain higher
clock speeds so for that I have the asus
rog Strix z 370 - i gaming motherboard
I've used this board before it has solid
power delivery for some overclocking
it's also got MDOT two slots a couple of
them do you
I know 2.11 AC Wi-Fi which is handy if
you need to not have to string an
Ethernet cable over to your benchmarking
setup for memory I have a G scale flare
X kit to buy 18 gigs speed 3200 and Casa
latency 14 and it shows this memory not
because it's actually designed for Rison
systems because it is very compatible
verizon systems but I just wanted to
maintain the same memory specs speed
compatibility and size across all of my
testing and 3200 casa latency 14 I have
quite a few kids to support that that
work in lots of different systems so
that's been kind of my standard for
memory recently for storage we got to go
with an nvme SSD so we got a samsung 960
pro 512 gig em dot 2 nvme SSD in there
really fast that quite as fast as the
newest 970 but of course it's gonna get
the job done probably more than enough
speed that we need and I did install
this under the little heatsink there to
provide a little bit of hopefully extra
heat dissipation I'm not expecting this
drive to do any traveling but if you got
a heatsink you might as well use it now
for CPU cooling I wanted to keep this
portable of course I didn't really want
a whole along and all in one liquid
cooler or anything like that although
those are very efficient and effective
at cooling a CPU and I probably could
have run at a higher frequency I went
with the Noctua NHL 12s switch neck - I
recently sent over somewhat low profile
CPU cooler depending on where you put
the fan and it does ship with a slim fan
but I found that that was conflicting
with the memory so I was gonna have to
move it to the top anyway so if I'm
gonna go ahead and put it on the top
then I might as well upgrade it so I
swapped in the nffa 12 X 25 PWM which is
pretty much the best cooling fan right
now especially if it's attached to a
radiator or a fin stack I did leave it
at the stock rpm settings for the
motherboard so well it is nice and quiet
it wasn't quite enough to keep the CPU
cool at all times but more on that in
just a second I guess I can briefly
point out that the little brackets
little metal brackets that hold the
original fan on are actually swappable
so you can use the same brackets to hold
the thicker full-size hundred 20
millimeter fan in there just something I
noticed that I hadn't done before so
there it is my entire setup and I think
I think I should be able to break this
down and actually fit it into the
motherboard box for travel but that's
not the entire system I need a power
supply so for these initial tests I'm
using this old-school PC power and
cooling silencer mark - 700
is an 80 plus silver rated power supply
but it's been in service for quite some
time and despite the ketchup and mustard
cables it's been doing a fine job but
I'm not planning to bring this with me
again maintaining portability means all
I want to bring is that little mother
bird bucks I'm hoping if I'm on the road
I will be somewhere where I can purchase
PC parts so the things I'm going to need
to buy if I need to run benchmarks on
the road is gonna be a power supply a
monitor which is the main thing I will
probably be a bit of an expense and then
probably a keyboard because I don't want
to lug around full-size keyboard as well
so that pretty much runs down the
hardware except for the graphics cards
and since this is a testbed that's being
intended to test graphics cards I
thought why not do some initial tests
here with the fastest graphics cards
that are available from both AMD and
NVIDIA so I have the NVIDIA GeForce GTX
1080 T I ran over here and I have the
AMD Radeon Vegas 64 right here these are
both aftermarkets overclocked versions
of the cards made by asus so these are
both the Asus Rd Strix versions of these
cards and I've had lots of people come
at me when I've done tests in the past
and say why did you choose this card why
didn't you run it at stock why didn't
you use the founders Edition why didn't
you overclock it as much as it could
possibly go and after doing this for
quite some time here's my philosophy on
that if a graphics card has been out for
a while long enough that third party
added board manufacturers have been able
to design custom cooling solutions for
them then those ad and board
manufacturers have probably also done a
little bit of overclocking on the cards
themselves this happens on both Nvidia
and AMD sides so my opinion is if you're
gonna buy a graphics card you might be
buying an overclocked one or you might
be buying a stock clock one and
overclocking it yourself you should be
able with any stock clock graphics card
to be able to get a little bit of extra
performance by overclocking so I feel
like it's not the best thing to do if
you're dealing with a card that's one or
two years old to test it at the base
lowest settings possible so an
aftermarket card represents a bit of
better cooling it also represents a bit
better clock speeds but not necessarily
a crazy high overclock that someone who
wasn't into overclocking would not be
able to achieve so that's kind of my
middle-of-the-road argument
that and of course you are welcome to
your opinions as well so if you disagree
different leave me a comment down in the
comment section below but the tests went
well fortunately I have a pretty decent
range of benchmarks that I should ran on
these two cards and I'm not going to
share them right now because honestly
they've been out for a little while and
nothing was too different than what I
have seen before and my test before or
tests that I've seen other people do in
the past six months to a year so whether
you're talking synthetics DirectX 12
DirectX 11 both of these cards perform
pretty well with the Vegas 64 coming in
right around the range of a GTX ten
eighty maybe a little faster a little
slower in certain situations and the
1080 TI of course proving that it is
still the fastest card currently
available so I guess before I pack
things up here the last thing I
mentioned is the CPU performance and
then I did do a touch of an overclock on
the CPU the 8700 K will boost to 4.7
gigahertz by default I put it so it's
boosting to 4.8 gigahertz on two cores
4.7 gigahertz on up to four cores and
then 4.5 gigahertz if it goes all the
way up to 6 cores because it was
actually getting a little too warm and
it's getting up in the 90s to mid 90s it
even led to a little bit of throttling
in certain situations and I think that's
just because while this is a very good
cooler it's not necessarily meant for
higher-end overclocks also just turning
up the fan speed would probably have
helped a little bit more but I was able
to get by with those frequencies
especially after the Sun went down and
things cooled off just a smidge so I'm
happy with those results for now but I
will say if you are getting an 87 or KNE
do it a go for a crazy overclock maybe
consider something beefier like the NHD
15 or of course an all-in-one liquid
cooler would be a great solution there
too
today we have it guys this is a pretty
slim container for a effectively
high-end benchmarking system that I have
set up here of course not everything is
included I don't have a monitor I don't
have a keyboard a mouse hope I'll be
bringing along with my laptop but of
course a power supply so it's not like I
have the entire system here but I have
the fundamentals necessary and just by
adding that monitor power supply
keyboard I can load up all the games
because they're all stored on the nvme
SSD and I can get up and running and
benchmark games well I am traveling in
that Alps or wherever the heck I'm and
end up going if you want to find out
where I'm actually going then you should
probably follow me on Twitter because
that's where I will be posting pictures
and also updates on my ongoing journey
so I'll post a link to that in the
video's description down below also
include links to the parts I've
installed in today's emergency portable
benchmarking rig and if you guys aren't
all excited about the mysterious things
that I'm not talking about that I could
be talking about that I may be slightly
alluding to but not actually mentioning
directly then leave a thumbs up on this
video and of course subscribe because I
have more contents mysterious upcoming
new content about new stuff that I can't
tell you about yet coming very soon
we'll see you guys in the next video and
after doing this for quite some time
here's my philosophy on that you all
right that's my philosophy you go
yourself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
