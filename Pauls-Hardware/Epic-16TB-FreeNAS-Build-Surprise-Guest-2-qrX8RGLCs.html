Paul's hardware today I'm going to be
doing a brand new build this is a
specialty build that's actually a mass
network attached storage and I have a
confession to make I've actually not
been running an ass here at home at
pretty much at all so this is going to
solve some problems for me but I'll go
into some of the features of the NASA
later I'm going to focus on the hardware
I get the system put together for today
so going to be it's long free NASA's
mentioned that uses ZFS file system file
system which features triple redundancy
beyond that I'm using some reused
hardware so I have parts that I already
had on hand which is often a very common
use case for an ask so for instance I
have a z77 I deluxe motherboard here
from Asus with an Intel Core i3 2105
this is a Sandy Bridge processor so it's
got a few years of use in it already but
it's still going to do a great job power
supply is pretty overkill this is
actually than one newest part of the
bill which is an RM 850 X from Corsair
80 plus gold again overkill but this
shouldn't be able to run in families
mode with the amount of power that this
SIL whole system is going to be drawing
fractal node 304 case nice and tiny
plenty of room for all the hard drives
they'll be putting in the hard drives by
the way are going to be WD red drives
which are made for Nass use and you're
going to want to pay attention to that
if you're picking out your hard drives
three and ass-master Ives are definitely
the way you want to go I got four of
those they're not right here right now
because they're still copying footage
off of my media center which I'm going
to be swapping them out from lastly of
course you've got to have some memory so
went ahead
you got the crucial blissed don't do it
all that's just wrong Ram this is just a
little 4 gig kit of Crucial Ballistix
that should be probably you're gonna be
running GFS ZFS is gonna need about one
gigabyte of ram per terabyte of hard
drive space oh so I brought with me some
fury HyperX
that made it sound like they pay for
this that I paid for this I think for
this brought to you Paul if you arrived
in the nick of time to thank you thank
you like a fury Thank You Logan from
tech syndicate this is this is this is a
fact
fantastic fairy HyperX thats about 16
gigabytes which is what you're gonna
using in your system because I got 16
terabytes of storage and that'll make it
work out just fine for you well that's a
look if my work done here ha how did you
know I was building an ass right now
oh uh Kane told me I didn't came no I
was building an ass right now
logan worked tirelessly into the nights
for hours on end here
I assumed it was ours it's a time lapse
so it's hard to tell maybe it was just a
few minutes but I woke the next morning
I was in a daze
Logan was gone but on the dining room
table was the nests in its most recent
form ready for the next step now the
stuff I was not able to take the day
before when Logan was actually here was
to install the drives themselves for
four terabyte WD red Nash drives these
were actually removed from my HTPC in my
living room which I did a video on last
year they've been doing a great job
there it's given me effectively about 11
terabytes of usable storage but I've
only actually ever used more about three
or four on that system so my next step
was to remove those drives and what I
had set up the day before was a big old
copy from the internal raid 5 array that
those four drives were in over to an
external drive or drive that I had set
up externally which is a Hitachi HGST
ultra star helium six terabyte drive
this is an enterprise drive nice and
fast nice and reliable and I'm going to
pop this as a single drive into my htpc
this will be handling DVR duties as well
as mass storage over there and all the
WD red drives are coming out to go in
the nest
and now as you can see I have installed
those WD red drives into the NASS I went
ahead and remove the middle rack from
the the note 304 here in order to give a
single Drive spacing in between each
drive since there's four so I actually
installed these two on the outside of
the cage to give you one here space one
here space one here space and one here
working out pretty good I just need to
do the final steps here to wire up those
drives power on the system and then we
will go forward with the the thing that
Logan left me other than a thorough
loganing was these two little USB drives
right here so for free and ass we
actually need an installer and we need a
drive to run off of this is the
installer and Logan already took the
time to create that and then install
FreeNAS onto this USB this is the USB
Drive that we're going to be running off
of it's USB 3 and
it's nothing's too special but it is
definitely recommended to get a USB
Drive or separate small drive to run the
LS off of okay that's about all I know
about FreeNAS so far let's go ahead and
finish out this build
so I got the drives all wired up and I
want to do one last little once over the
hardware here before I move on to the
software first off I wanted to keep this
little USB internally that's going to
run off of I didn't want it sticking out
the back here so I didn't have a simple
USB 2.0 internal like a bracket header I
feel like I should have lots of those
lying around but instead I had to go
with the kind of workaround which is a
USB 3.0 header and then I have this
adapter that goes USB 3.0 USB 2.0 so
it's a little bit of a waste of USB 3.0
header but I actually have I found like
three of those but none of the USB 2.0
is around and just just kind of how it
goes with the computer parts one other
thing here is the cable management of
course which is looking and I don't know
it's it's like in between for an ITX
built around on this side it's
definitely pretty mishmash II but the
main important things that I'm worrying
about here is that I have clear channels
here between the drives for those two
front intake fans on the front to push
air back which I do it's a little bit
blocked over on the side but open for
the most part this Center area is also
quite clear and open so that's important
and I got the exhaust at the back so
it's going to be pulling any hot air out
of there and then the power supply
fortunately is kind of on its own little
system here and a little exhaust out the
side the the panel that's on the side of
the note three or four okay one last
thing and this is a pretty important one
that I had a sneaking suspicion about
and I don't know what tipped me off that
this might be the case but if you're
working with older hardware or just
hardware that you've had around for a
while you shouldn't always assume
everything is is the way it should be so
for example I have this stock heatsink
fan on this on this board here and I did
use this board in my htpc for quite a
while before I built the new one that
about a year ago I decided to pull this
off just to double-check and thank God I
did because there's no freaking thermal
paste on this thing absolutely none that
might have met have been a negative
impact on my CPU temperature so I'm just
going to add some thermal paste pop this
back on and then we'll get the software
up and running before I close out this
video
well some time has passed since I last
worked on the system but I'm happy to
say that with the just a little bit of
work today and last night's I managed to
get FreeNAS installed it is set up and
it seems to be working just fine
I used the Installer that Logan set me
up with and beyond a couple
complications that I had which is mainly
just because this board the motherboard
had been used in a system prior I had to
reset the CMOS and that pretty much
cleared up any issues I was having but
if you've ever installed Windows before
it was nothing more complicated than
switching the boot device over to this
and then after the installation went
through switching the boot device back
over to the USB Drive that's installed
right over there internally and
everything's working just fine after
everything got installed onto that
little gigabyte drive over there which
just a matter of booting off of that it
will go through and recognize all the
hardware it looks like it recognized
pretty much everything that was in there
it will prompt you to create a root
password and then it will get you to a
point where you have a list of commands
on the screen that you can do directly
with the system or you can do what is
much more simple and you can switch over
to actually just using a web browser on
a different computer connect to the same
network it will give you an IP address
at the bottom which will almost always
start with 192 as far as I know when I
so go there and then it will prompt you
to login you can log in using the same
login and password that you created as
you went through the glut process and
now we are into FreeNAS now I was going
to start going through some of the setup
processes here they do have a wizard for
example that will kind of guide you
through setting up some of the things
like a data pool and that kind of thing
and language all that good thing all
that good stuff now my main issue with
FreeNAS is really that I just haven't
used it much before so here's where any
semblance of a tutorial for this video
is going to end because I'm mainly
comfortable with setting up the hardware
side of it I need to do some dabbling
and some messing around with this in the
FreeNAS UI they do have a wizard you can
go through what I'm actually going to be
using is a Wendell's video on tech
syndicate and I'll link that down in the
description and he goes through kind of
some of the basic setup procedures for
setting up your storage the way you want
it and getting it set up so it can
handle some of the more advanced
functions like backup and all those
things what I really want to do with
this Nass in the future and that's what
I will be doing a follow-up video on
probably in the next couple weeks is set
it up to do some of the really cool
things that I know NASA's can do apart
from just being a massive amount of
storage that's here at home that I can
access to do a bunch of backups on like
dropping all my old video footage onto
it or that kind of thing or old edits
that I want to keep I will also be using
it possibly to tie into my HTPC I want
to take all the mechanical drives out of
the HTPC so it gets dead silent do some
backup storage on here with some SSD
storage over there I want to be able to
do a media server on here of course so I
can have videos as well as music that I
can access from other devices around the
house or if I'm on the go can access
them remotely I want to set this up so I
also have remote access when I'm like on
the road so when I've done trips like
CES or Computex for example I don't
always have time to edit while I'm there
so I have worked with a couple editors
in the past and I would like to have the
ability to upload all my footage
straight to here and then have my editor
who's somewhere else be able to remotely
access that to pull the footage off of
it so they can do edits and there's lots
of other cool things that you can do
with an ass so if you have an ass and
you have set it up to do something cool
that you'd like to see me try out maybe
leave that in the comment section down
below or if you don't know if you're
like I maybe couldn't ask do this also
leave me your questions good because I
am just as curious as you guys probably
are anyway though don't forget to hit
the like button if you enjoyed this
video stay tuned for more coverage on
the NASS and further developments there
and don't forget to check out my store
where you can purchase shirts like this
one as well as mugs and glasses that's a
great way to support me and get yourself
some awesome hardware or well some
merchandise in the meantime and also if
you're just shopping on Amazon my Amazon
links are down in the description - you
can click those before you shop I get a
little kickback and that is a great way
to help me out as well just while you're
shopping for stuff on Amazon thanks
