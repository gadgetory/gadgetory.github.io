you
you
hello everyone welcome to Paul's
hardware this is the video you guys have
been waiting for it asking for for so
long
jay is here how's it go Jay I'm doing
good how are you I'm doing fantastic you
didn't seem prepared for me to ask you a
question I interviewed before it like it
feels like an interview this iske so
instead of diving right into the build
and starting putting all this water
cooling system together Jay and I we're
just gonna have a conversation here for
maybe 15-20 minutes just get you guys
warmed up for it that sound it sound
good I like being warmed up okay we're
going to get straight to the build I
won't mess around with you guys but I do
need to start off by saying a slew of
thank you so many many thank yous and
the first one goes out to you that's
right you guys watching this video right
now there's no way that I or J could do
any of the things that we do without you
guys your support your likes your
feedback comments everything that you
guys do for us so thank you so much for
all that support right absolutely even
the dislikes those helped us out - I
still like dislikes which is weird I
also need to thank the sponsors for this
bill for the hardware of course so so
I'm going to go run right down the line
Intel of course for the 59 60 X it's
long I did swap that out we also have
Asus for the X 99 deluxe motherboard
that's in their gigabyte of course for
the two gtx 980 with gaming g1 gaming
windforce graphics cards that I'm using
fractal who supplied the fractal design
thousand watt Newton 80 + Platinum par
spot as well as the define r5 case as
well as the Kelvin closed-loop CPU
cooler that I've been using temporarily
we're going to be swapping that out but
it's still done a great job up till this
point GCL a huge huge thank you to G
scale for providing the 32 gigabytes 4
by 8 gigabytes ddr4 memory kit that's
from the Ripjaws 4 series and then of
course Samsung for providing not only
the 850 Evo that's in there right now
that the operating system is loaded on
but Samsung's also sending me over a
couple more 850 pros and I'm going to do
another video on that after everything's
set up to talk about rate yeah raid and
how I do video editing and how I copy
footage and all that good stuff and then
of course I can't go without thinking of
the suppliers of the water cooling parts
so we have ek of course who have
provided lots of stuff I did an unboxing
of all these parts so you can check it
out for the radiators pump and reservoir
CPU block GPU block
as well as all the furious Vardar fans
which are quite angry at me
they're very furious also a terminal and
then primo chill who has provided all of
the fittings as well as the rigid ptg
tubing and then of course a huge thank
you to je once again for being here not
only on his day off but also on a day
when he could be benchmarking a gtx
titan x who says I have a Titan X I hate
the time okay one last thing to say
before we jump in here and that is that
while we are doing all the hard line
tubing and everything today this is not
going to be the final video on this
build
not quite I will point out that I'm
still going to be doing some sleeping on
the power supply and then I'm also going
to be doing a side panel mod but that's
coming in the future because we just we
want to get the wire clean stuff soon
you're going to be sleeping the power
supply yeah the pump because the pump
needs to be sleeved top needs leading
and so does that yeah when we need to
get rid of the red here on the the
Furious bars but yeah that'll be another
project coming up we've talked enough
let's let's build J let's do it all
right
the other thing the other thing we
didn't mention to you guys is that it's
90 degrees outside today of course but
that's that's why I'm a water cooling
right and it's so freakin cold in the
Northeast
yeah there's snow everywhere but that's
okay
alright so we have taken a dive or JS
actually been mainly taking a dive into
the graphics cards themselves now these
cards actually have kind of a different
means of disassembly J then then some
you have experience so what is what's
the magical juju for getting the GeForce
GTX 980 g1 gaming graphics cards and
often times you'll just have all the
screws on the back of the plate and it
just comes apart like a clamshell but as
you can see here these screws are all
underneath the cooler these three or not
these four on the GPU or not so let's
put scratching you think of it okay um
we're not using those anymore so I just
kinda want to show the the procedure for
taking it apart on a wind force card
since you know people have started water
cooling these things so you start with a
three back here next to the g1 gaming
logo and they're they're pretty tight uh
she said hey and then you do the four
around the GPU here these are
spring-loaded screws so make sure you
keep some tension on that when you
unscrew them where they could go flying
across the room that's all that's always
the fun of disassembling a graphics card
is hunting down the screws they've gone
absolutely well so they said that was
all scratched up looks like that our
time assembling it easy so this is the
part two where people have been confused
like it's still not coming apart the
amount of thermal paste and the heat
pads that they use on these they act
like glue so I mean I'm putting a lot of
tension on that it's not coming apart so
you want to kind of start towards the
front there you go you can just wiggle
it apart this one came apart easier than
the other one the other one I thought I
had missed the screw this must have been
the upper card and still it's some
residual warmth leftover from when I was
benchmarking last night right there you
go
but as you can see stuff two cables in
there you have
one for the fan control one for the LED
control don't yank this apart you want
to be mindful of that cable that way you
can salvage it because you never know if
you're gonna need to put this card back
together for warranty or upgrade or
whatever now once you do that you take
the main cooler off then you can get
access to the silver screws which will
allow the backplate to come off and then
when you're done just kind of screw
everything back together and then you'll
end up with the cooler like this just
reassemble so you don't lose your screws
and stick it back in your GPU boxes and
we're going to we're gonna list that on
eBay as a new gtx 980 see ya there you
go the new stealth edition just be very
creative on the angles which you shoot
it at no PCI Express connector required
remote remote mounting the next step is
going to be removing that back plate of
course and then we're going to do some
cleaning to get the GPU all cleaned off
Jay has already lifted off some of the
thermal pads but these are thermal pads
we have replacement thermal pads here
for the MOSFETs so we don't need to keep
this stuff we're just going to toss that
and the next step we're gonna be
installing them blocks yep sweep yeah I
mean they even show right here I wish I
could get it that nice like I mean you
could never ever get such a thin yeah
that is pretty pretty pristine there so
NJ's ugly little because it could I mean
look how big the nozzle is on this thing
it's impossible there so we we know from
doing YouTube for a while that there's
no right way to do thermal paste no
matter which way you do and say hey
here's how you should do thermal paste
people say it's wrong so Jay is using
the X pattern which I haven't seen
actually since CAG did it back when we
did our wow that was so long ago but
that is recommended by ek and Jay and I
can't even put as many lines as they
recommend because it would just be way
too much they want like a stars yeah
like that but when I get X in and across
but the the Eco therm that they send
with it it's a non-conductive so it's
not going to matter that it gets over
here you know on the conductors and crap
so this is the way I've done it in every
single water block I've ever done and
thermals have always been perfect across
the board so
that that's the way I do it but you guys
could technically do the P method on
this but anytime I've ever done the P
method it doesn't spread all the way to
the corners and believe it or not
getting out getting full coverage on a
GPU diet it's not like a CPU where it's
just in the center this is the die so
because most CPUs have us have a heat
spreader on it throw a die is much
smaller than the spread over here we
actually want full 100% coverage over
that entire day because this is the die
this is not a heat spreader so
everything from edge to edge under there
is the architecture so you one at full
coverage and you do want it to run over
the sides a little bit so you're
covering the entire thing okay it
actually matters and we are now ready to
connect the block to the GPU this is the
moment of great portent and there it is
well that was anticlimactic no now you
got to flip it over and get all it all
tight now that's why I use the box like
this because this way two sticks out
you'll never get it flat you put on the
table it falls off and I so I always go
like this and then of course this is why
you need to purchase the ek back plates
because they will line up properly with
the ek blocks right and that is what
will be next just some screws to screw
in yep ok so there's always that common
debate back plates do they do anything
on air cooled cards not as much most of
them don't even contact anything on the
back but II can know is that the back of
the BC PCB gets just as hot as the front
because everything that connects to it
it has flux that goes through and as you
can see we do have active capacitors
back here in the BRM componentry is on
the back of the card as well this is
also the back of the GPU these are the
conductors right here specifically for
the GPU so these get freaking hot as
well so ek actually as you can see here
with their back plates they have special
cutouts that that's going to touch
anything on the back plate that gets hot
as thermal pads are going to mount on
there so when you tighten this down
this becomes a heat spreader it's a back
plate but it's also a heat spreader so
any active cooling you have in your case
good case flow it's going to help cool
the back of the PCB on these cards so so
I put that out there when you want to
cool at least with the ek blocks they
are going to make in contact which means
you do need to put the thermal pads
there too you don't want to just say a
screw it and crank it down because you
then could create a short on the
backyard net that'll lead to a very
terrible day
that's me how I know that I don't know
though J like I only bought the back
plate for the aesthetics so I don't
really want the heat dissipation all
right we'll go ahead make the thermal
pads off all right GPU blocks are
installed and good to go both of them
side by side of course we need to still
install the connector between those
meanwhile inside the case here I've gone
ahead and installed our 360 rad up at
the top we're getting the fans installed
on that - here's the two fittings so our
hard line is going to need to be up in
this area going down into this area
we've also got the front radiator
installed right up here fittings are the
connectors up at the top which Jay has
recommended is the best option to keep
your portal and the future
if you're just joining us J was just
explaining to me how he is trying his
best to get a handle on the nut down
there so we have come to the point in
the build where we are we may or may not
be at a stopping point the stopping
point for us is mounting that pump /r
add the ekx res 140 which as you can
maybe tell now that a lot more of the
parts are in here there's not a ton of
space for so the plan was to put it up
on top of the drive cage right here
however the mount for the bracket leaves
a lot of space down underneath as you
can see right where the pump sort of
extends yeah so this this little section
of the pump down there and you're not
supposed to set that directly on
anything because you might get some
vibration so what we're going to try to
do right now and we'll see if it works
is I have a metal 120 millimeter fan
bracket that we're going to mount right
here and then hopefully mount the
bracket for the pump out right here and
set it in there so J is setting that up
yeah
and we're going to give it a moment of
truth test here in just a moment and see
if that will actually work for us
that could work
yeah I mean this is a metal bracket and
then there's four points where it will
mount and then still a decent amount of
clearance on that Reds on all sides and
more than enough room for acrylic
fittings on the top beautiful okay I got
the CPU block here so let's up it
precariously right there this is a
mounting hardware and this is our
thermal paste we have instructions here
I'm gonna ignore oh oh I read the
instructions all right so it's an
optimal insert that that's what the
plastic piece is I've never done so it
comes with two right this is the two
version and I'm guessing the one that
comes pre-installed with yeah this is
the - I - it says right there and I -
should be used for AMD or LG they 2011 -
three well I guess you better install it
should I I've never I didn't do it in
skunk works and I'm still sitting like
high 50s low 60s under low should I I'm
gonna go with J then I'm gonna choose
it's J telling me for one and it's the
easy route it's the easy route and I
said I've never done it but I've never
experienced any negative okay now do you
ever like this right I mean if you want
to open it for the sake of seeing when
it's like it's just four screws in an
overhang yeah we'll do that we'll do
another video in the future I'll have
clean
the shame is their pity UK definitely
has some pretty liquid stuff okay so
that's gonna go right there and we're
done
it's a lure crooked so okay straighten
it out there you go cap things here and
some washers and I got two sets of these
which is probably what I will need this
Forge to tell the difference between
them so love em is locked alright we got
the block here that's that's how that's
supposed no it's not put the springs on
too quick I love when it has some let's
eat I like I like blocks whether you're
talking about a custom block for water
cooling loop or a they're all in one
cooler or heck a an air cooler for that
matter
I love blocks to give you the rails that
mop that up right at the beginning it
makes it easy to drop it on it's
centered the thermal paste is going to
spread really well nice and evenly and
then it's just there it's not sliding
around it's being held in place that's
please I got some your tension Springs
and then these little caps
maybe the caps are pretty they are
attention to detail
it's nice clean finish there's a lot of
companies out there that make a really
pretty block and then have really ugly
hardware Hey hardware's just visibles
block it's still important
I'm doing four corners method here you
never never look at that
never look at it while you're tightening
it down though that look so the fact
that you're cracking the block doesn't
matter how far do you go down in this
please stop no threated okay they'll
stop when there's when you're tightening
it that's sometime soon but then you
freaked me out
good luck well hey GPUs terminals if
there is a difficulty here it's these
little rings because the o-rings are
very important we need a watertight seal
and Jay has been taking the ones from
the little single credit terminals that
come on the cards and then replacing
them over onto our two card parallel
terminal we've settled on the position
of the radiator we got to mount it up
right here and we've also worked out a
drainage you said radiator that I said
radius a pump the pumps right here it's
mounted to the radiator back to the
parts of the system all inside yes it's
just back to the basics but Jay worked
out this awesome little drainage system
so it's kind of in the back we're going
to use some of the flexible tubing and
some of the flexible tubing fittings
that I did in Jay has this this little
guy he added on here so this is going to
go at the end of the tube we'll cut the
tube off right around there and then
it's got a little clamp on it you're
like little release valve and then of
course for safety it's capped on the end
so to drain in the future I just got to
pull that cap off twist the valve and
then hang that out we'll just tuck it
away at the back of the system there and
a nice easy way to drain the system
which is very important and where people
don't think about drainage drainage
isn't partner this is a real problem it
is I'm just ecstatic that we actually
have this pump installed here we were
really kind of at a loss for a while how
to do this but this is a metal bracket
that actually came with a silver stone
item don't worry Josh if you're watching
I removed the silver stone logo it was
from a silver stone power supply
actually so I pulled that off and we're
able to mount the bracket for the pump
right there and it's actually pretty
sturdy too there's a little bit of
clearance at the bottom I can back up a
little bit and you can see down there
once we get the rigid tubing installed
that's actually going to give it even
more support and other than that look
everything's coming together that's
pretty well folks the build is finished
all completed powered on temperatures
we're getting about we're adding about
30 C max on everything under full load
we use that new and visit line tubing
overclocked to seventeen hundred
megahertz on the GPU and the CPU is not
running actually at seven megahertz
gigahertz seven make a stuff up alright
so we're gonna tell you guys a quick
story here because as J was certain was
explaining to me moments ago when it
comes to custom builds when it comes to
more complicated bill sometimes you hit
a stopping points and that's where we're
at right now that's actually every time
sir every single time I've never done a
custom build that didn't require me to
stop rethink or have to do something
really different
okay now the first potential stopping
point that we hit today was the mounting
of the reservoir / pump
yes as J is pointing at with the pointer
fortunately we got around that we've
actually mounted it as you may have
heard earlier to the radiator we used a
metal 120 millimeter fan bracket that
actually pulled off of a since I was a
player because Paul came up with the
idea of mounting it to the radiator
somehow with the little plastic bracket
he found this guy that one but this is
plastic it would not have held up and so
I said well what about like a metal one
off of a power supply or something if
Paul was like I don't think I have a 120
on a power supply first when you grab
that any one point I went over there
pull is okay this will work perfect and
it was black now so it actually matches
I'm perfectly happy to leave it in there
and it's providing a pretty solid mount
for the pump now let's move on to the
stopping point which is when we were
about to start looking at bending the
tubing
right so okay the biggest challenge
we're going to have here is making it
pretty going from this red to the inlet
on the pump and basically the way we
have it arranged that's what makes the
most sense we were getting ready to do a
test bend or get a fire up the heat gun
and stuff we took out the Primo chill
bending kit this is a 10 by 13
millimeter piece of det g tubing means
the inner diameter is 10 mil Aerodyne
verse 13 this is a 10 mil bending kit
mm-hmm it does not fit in here at all if
it does not fit you must equate to
rustic but you can't so you can't heat
and bend the ptg tubing without and all
something else are you going to bend it
if there's nothing in there like a man
this basically acts like a mandrel okay
it won't allow it to collapse on itself
the moment you try and bend this if you
heat it with nothing in it it will just
it will just kink it was kink it there's
nothing keeping its shape so you have to
have an insert like this I have this
exact same bending kit and I also have
primo chill btg tubing at home that I've
used plenty of times you guys have seen
builds that I've done with it no
problems whatsoever so one of two things
have happened here pyrrha chill does not
make this two they outsource it just
like everyone else they go to a plastic
supplier same thing with the silicone
they found suppliers that have products
that they need one of two things have
happened here either both of these or
one of these have some sort of a
variance in tolerance I'm leaning more
towards it might be the silicone insert
but it could also be this tube it's it's
close enough to where you would think
you could get it to fit with a little
bit of lubrication here we go again guys
trying to fit it in there just wouldn't
we tried I mean I can get it started but
even if this was like say it say you had
oil on there you're not gonna get it
down far enough we could have tried to
just shove it in there and bend it but
the problem is then even if we have the
oils in there you're heating this up if
those start to evaporate at all and you
lose any of that viscosity you go to
pull this out and it breaks off in the
tube that's a worse time than it not
fitting because then do that whole tube
of scrapped the silicone insert is
scrapped at that point and then you're
never going to get that piece out and if
you did it'd be so short you wouldn't do
anything with it so the best thing to do
here was to stop probably contact the
manufacturers and say hey we're having a
tolerance problem here see what they
recommend I'm actually going to
this piece of tube home and I'm going to
test it with my silicon piece so we can
determine if the problem is the tube of
the silicon because I have more tubing
at home so I can at least compare J's
going to test my tube out and he'll
he'll get back to all of us with my
socks out poles over all right but that
to sum it up at least wraps up this
video so guys I'm sorry we didn't quite
get as far as we were intending to today
but just go sometimes you're like the
sexiest part I know the sexiest part
which is a tomb bedding tube bending but
uh don't worry because we're going to do
that still the tube bending will still
happen just going to be a little bit
away miss Paul off set aside as much
time as I need to get this build done
even though I've got two more acrylic
tubing builds to do as well as finish
the parvum build and skunkworks is
getting an upgrade which we'll talk
about in future may have already set -
the good news is there's lots of content
coming for you guys so stay tuned thank
you for watching this video don't forget
to hit the like button don't forget to
subscribe don't forget to go to my store
and buy a t-shirt it's store dot Pulsar
bourdette net don't forget to use either
of our Amazon links if you're buying
stuff at Amazon and then we get a little
bit of a kickback and that always helps
out too and I think that's all right I
feel I feel like we have failed here
today it's not no it's not a failure
your day it's merely a slight delay
both darf I've sure does fit the good
news is this thing is looking beautiful
oh so nice so far I get to keep it
forward getaway
yep they give it away to myself but guys
thank you so much for watching this
video we'll be back very soon with the
two bending and the finished build and a
couple other mod projects on it as well
and we'll see you all next time on the
youtubes seriously once you give it away
hold on just think facing me though we
knew this facing you right it's facing
you if you want to talk to me like what
Paul strangers it's like that's the
limitation of that yeah I have to face
it one way or the other well if you're
the one talking we should be facing you
right I can use the in-camera audio or
something if it's okay you also might
notice some some of them I like like
some things with building in production
like I don't care some of your Paul isms
some of my Paul isms are I'm like I will
easily let that slide for the sake of
this thing is still going something your
glasses are all glittery so but only you
can see that way I could see that well
Paul's a Paul's a vampire</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
