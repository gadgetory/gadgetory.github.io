my HTPC build series where I will be
assembling my system asking some
existential questions and using the
power of short lists to prove that I'm
right so here it is I'm finally
constructing my HTPC that has been
planned and assembled outside the box
and tested with great success thus far
it's good to be finally building in the
fractal node 804 case but some of the
weirder things about this build got me
thinking and as a result today I'll be
using my new HTPC as an example as I ask
the question what makes an HTP see and
is it a HTPC or an htpc idea anyway well
I can safely say that all these parts
make my htpc so here's why I chose them
starting with the case that I just
mentioned the node 804 the clean design
and black brushed front bezel will blend
in great with a home theater it has
optical drive support which was
important to me I grabbed a slim
slot-loading blu-ray player for that I
will say I was hesitant about the side
window in the 804 more on that later
though the motherboard is the ASUS
Maximus 5 gene the CPU is the Intel Core
i5 35 70 K and we also have 8 gigabytes
of Corsair ddr3 1600 memory these are
all parts from an existing system that I
wasn't using anymore and I think this is
very common for HT pcs to take a
slightly out of date system and
repurpose it for use in the living room
this is also a significant boost in
processing power for me which I like
because part of this builds purpose is
to improve gaming performance speaking
of which my video card at least for the
purposes of this video is the EVGA GTX
970 SC this is overkill but I want a
fast quiet card that can handle 1080p
games and this will easily do all of
that the power supply is a fractal and
Tegra M 750 watt again a very quiet part
that does its job without problems I
like that it's modular and I'm only
going to be using maybe 50% of its
capacity which means I'll be sitting
right at the sweet spot of the 80 plus
bronze efficiency curve my storage array
is my boldest choice I think a Plex ster
256 gigabyte M SATA SSD for the
operating system combined with 4 WD red
4 terabyte hard drives in raid 5 this
gives me 11 terabytes of usable capacity
for DVR use movie and music storage and
oh so many games and you better
this will be a steadily growing beast of
a media server as well raid 5 means I
can get some very nice read speeds and
I'll still be able to save my array of a
single Drive fills although my write
speeds are low right now which makes me
want to do a little bit more tweaking
and testing I also have a Seton Infiniti
V TV tuner card with cable card support
and 4 HD tuners allowing me to watch and
record a cable TV shows and this was
also carry over from my old
decommissioned HTPC finally we have
peripherals most notably my wireless
keyboard with built-in Mouse from i/o
year the classic Windows Media Center
remote and IR receiver and my new
wireless Xbox 360 for PC controller with
the awesome receiver that it comes with
the connect up to 4 controllers and I've
confirmed it already works with my
existing xbox360 wireless controller
base week so now it's time for those
lists I was promising let's start with 3
things that do not make an HT PC in my
humble opinion starting with the TV
tuner card really yes yes the TV tuner
card because there's a big movement
towards cutting out cable companies
entirely due to their outdated business
model and shady business practices at
times you can easily get all the
entertainment you need with just an
internet connection so I consider this a
nice to have rather than a requirement
even though I am using one on my system
next up is bling that's right no need
for fancy paint jobs or LED
embellishments with an htpc this should
be stealthy and quiet like a dead cat
because even the faintest glow can ruin
the mood while you're watching your
stories the third thing is my WD red
raid 5 array what oh my gosh yes yes
really it's overkill it's almost
completely unnecessary here but I still
think it's awesome really all you need
is a single large hard drive for a DVR
or an HTC see but do at least make sure
that it's a drive like these WD Reds
that are made for 24/7 continuous
operation or the drive you choose
probably won't last as long as you hope
so with that out of the way let's move
on to the second list what about three
things that do make an HT PC well first
there's location location location
location yes it's in the living room of
course obvious a home theater PC in a
home theater well this actually does
bring into consideration things like
case aesthetics because you want the
system to blend in noise is also a
factor in the living room where head
or less of an option so you want the
system to be silent and of course for
connectivity you'll want to be able to
connect to your stereo receiver or HDTV
preferably using HDMI at minimum 4k
adopters well that's another video the
second thing that does make a computer
in HTPC is interaction human interface
devices simply need to be rethought in
the living room mostly they need to be
Wireless and RF mouse and keyboard are
key Wireless game controllers for sure
are incredibly convenient and a good
old-fashioned remote control makes the
experience a pleasant one finally our
third thing is flexibility how
delightfully vague what do I mean
well the flexibility to use hand-me-down
parts from old systems as nice and HT
pcs typically don't need the same amount
of power as a desktop flexibility to
handle multiple tasks a DVR for cable a
portal for Netflix or Amazon Instant
Video YouTube standard web browsing
pretty much any game ever via Steam
origin you play good old games emulators
the list goes on and on as long as it's
not marked as a console exclusive pretty
much and yes this is also what makes PCs
in general great but I needed a third
reasoned and I think it's damn good one
so let me know if you think my lists
were accurate let me know what you think
of my new HTPC and let me know if you
run an HD PC at home right now in the
comments below oh yes there will also be
a part three I have decided but a little
bit later on after I spend a little bit
more time with the new system I'll be
upgrading from the stock CPU heatsink
fan I'll be giving some more feedback on
my experience and maybe trying to fix my
raid arrays performance because I think
it can get better don't forget to like
the video subscribe to my channel thanks
for watching guys we'll see you next
