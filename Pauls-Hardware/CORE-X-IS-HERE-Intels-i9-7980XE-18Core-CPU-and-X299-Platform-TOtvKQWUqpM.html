to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster alright guys welcome to my
Computex coverage proper and I'm going
to start off with the big announcements
the big announcement is coming from
Intel today and you guys have heard some
rumors probably about all the stuff that
they are confirming the launch of the I
9 series of what is now going to be
known as the core X series of CPUs have
a bunch of information going to kind of
run down a lot of this for you guys and
then towards the end I'm going to give
some closing comment arey my thoughts on
what they have going on here so this is
the newest high-end desktop platform X
299 chipset and LGA 2066 sockets is what
the motherboards will be sporting and
we're going to have Core i5 core i7 and
core i 9 x-series CPUs in this lineup
the quinine family is going to include
include CPUs that range all the way from
four cores all the way up to 18 cores
most of them with hyper-threading
although at least one of them does not
and there's going to be nine CPUs in
total in this lineup so that includes a
14 for a 64 and an 18 core CPU that 18
course 50 with hyper threading gives you
36 threads all these are based on 40
nanometers lithography all these CPUs
are unlocked for overclocking
and of course at the top of this range
you have that halo product the chlorine
79-80 Extreme Edition 1800 or 36 thread
CPU at $1,999 so this is not going to be
cheap it is a good three hundred bucks
more than the 69 50 X was when it
launched just about a year ago it is the
first ever teraflop desktop CPU though
at the low end of this entire line if
you have the KB Lake X based quad cores
the $242 70 640 X that does not have
hyper threading so it's a four core 4
thread CPU as well as a $339 77 40 X
with hyper-threading that's got 112 watt
TDP actually both of those have 112 watt
TDP s
and both of them are based on a camellia
architecture so they're going to be
shipping at higher frequencies 4.2
gigahertz and 4.5 gigahertz turbo
respectively for the 70 640 X and 77 for
the X these two CPUs do have some
limitations though compared to the
higher and skylake X CPU
CPUs in this lineup there
limited to dual channel memory and 16
PCI Express gen3 lanes so given that
there's also going to be 28 Lane CPUs
and 44 Lane CPUs in this nine CPU stack
that Intel's launching is probably to be
some extremely confusing X 299
motherboard configurations simply
because the depending on what CPU you
install you're going to have about a 16
28:44 lanes but perhaps more on that as
we bring you more coverage throughout
this week and perhaps tops of some of
the motherboard manufacturers above the
kb lake x cpus we have skylake x cpus so
these are going to all be all the six
core and higher parts they're all going
to have quad channel ddr4 memory support
and again either 28 4 44 pci express 3.0
lanes and they're listed at 140 watt
PDP's for the ones that we have
confirmed although they did mention in
the documentation that until distributed
165 watt TDP s so some of those some of
those highest score counts EPS might be
a little bit beyond 140 watts they're
all priced from between three hundred
ninety dollars and two thousand dollars
and you might notice that in the church
provided the 14 core 16 corn 18 core
parts don't have all the details that
are laid out and actually they weren't
even included in the original
presentation that Intel gave us about a
week ago so their TDP might be a hundred
and sixty-five watts for those higher
end ones but potentially they were added
a little bit later in this production
cycle so maybe Intel wasn't always
planning on doing 14 16 and 18 core CPUs
more on that later though the x-series
also has support for octane memory and
obtain SSDs also turbo boost max 3.0
that's the successor to Turbo Boost 2.0
that will identify not the single
fastest core on the CPU but the two
fastest cores on the CPU give you a
little asterisk by them in the BIOS and
that will automatically like to
overclock those CTS more also they're
going to have a hardware based solution
for this now so you don't have to
actually install some software to get
turbo boost working so that's pretty
nice
also the turbo boost max 3.0 only seems
to apply it skylake X diffuse which
would make sense since with a fork or
it's not quite as big of a deal to find
the fastest cores on the teeth you and
we also got some details of the X 299
chipset it will include
thirty high-speed I Alain's those of the
lanes allow you to connect stuff through
the chipset like SATA ports and other
things like that including up to 24 of
those that are PCI Express gen3 via the
DMI 3.0 interface upgrade to the mi 2.0
and then among these are going to have
connectivity for three Intel rst rapid
storage technology devices so PCIe again
Gen 3.0 by full connectivity so that's
for connecting up high-speed nvme SSD so
you can potentially have m dot 2 and u
dot 2 nvme SSDs in raid that are
controlled by the hardware controllers
as part of the chipset that's something
that you currently cannot do on X 99 as
I have sort of demonstrated in my videos
that I post in the past couple weeks
actually also in there you have some
support for an Intel I to 190 and
Ethernet that's going to be up to the
motherboard manufacturer whether or not
they actually want to integrate that
with the motherboard and I've also noted
a few times in this presentation the
rebalance Intel smart cache hierarchy
you might notice some of the l3 cache
numbers here being a little different
from like the x2 99 or the X 99
counterparts l3 cache sizes that are
listed on the chart do seem to scale up
but there's no additional information
about them so we'll have to come back to
you on that it's pretty much all the raw
details that Intel's provide us for
right now let's move on to my thoughts
on this it's definitely some good news
let's start with the good news there is
some price drops that are sprinkled in
amongst all of these cpu listings even
though you might look at a $2,000
top-end processor and say they are
raising the price but they're actually
kind of lowering the price for what you
would pay for example for an eight-core
Intel processor the 8 core 7 8 20 X is
599 dollars the 6900 K that you would
have had to buy just last week cop mm
that's a foreigner dollar price drop for
an 8 core Intel CPU
the 10 core 7900 X is 999 dollars 6 950
X was 1700 so that is again a price job
depending on how you look at it of
course also I'd like to thank himself
for leaving DK off of the end of any of
these SKUs they're all just an X that
simplifies things
X works just fine for us we don't need 2
K in there the CPU names are already
confusing as it is I do have some
questions about this launch and
hopefully we'll be able to answer these
soon especially once we get parts in
testing but I have questions about the
viability of the KB Lake XC if you use
the four core four thread and fork or
eight thread options at the bottom of
this stack they do seem to be at odds
price to performance wise with intel's
current mainstream platform and what you
can get on x 270 also the fact that they
have sixteen PCIe lanes again means
you're gonna have some really weird
configurations with x to 99 motherboards
and I'm expecting XQ 99 motherboards to
be more expensive than what you would
pay for is a 270 so whether you have 16
28 or 44 PCIe lanes might be a fairly
heavy amount of reconfiguration of a
motherboard PCI Express slots that may
or may not work depending on the CPU
have installed as well as you that - and
m dot - flops so that might lead to some
confusion I think impels plan for this
is just to be able to say it's an
upgrade pack you can get in with a 4
core processor and then upgrade to an 18
core or 16 core processor down the line
that's certainly a possibility that
would kind of reflect back I'm like the
the the spots of the i7 922 experienced
in spec and X 58 days Intel also said
that there has been lost of throat 20%
plus in the and desktop space and their
case scheme CPUs from 2015 to 2016 and
that's why they have decided to go the
route they've gone with this launch but
surely this also has to be at least a
bit of a reaction to AMD's recently
announced announced rise in thread
Ripper CPU which is a 16 core 32 thread
CPU and it will be on a new high-end
desktop platform from AMD that will be
in direct competition with this high-end
desktop platform from Intel case in
point
when they originally gave us this
presentation I took a bunch of
screencaps none of those 14 core 16 core
or 18 core CPUs were even listed they
verbally told us that they existed and
then I sent us an updated deck with the
additional information so it seems like
it was a bit of a like oh crap we need
to add these in here and it does seem to
line up with the way that they want to
market the CPUs especially considering
that these are very high-end and very
expensive CPUs so my humble opinion
Intel is playing a marketing game that's
kind of similar to the marketing game
that Nvidia has been playing with Radeon
for quite some time that is that they're
pushing their brand is the high-end
option
possibly with a higher price than the
competition but also with better Val
Quality Assurance and integration with
existing technologies in fact that Intel
has been dominating the CPU space for
quite a while this also though means
that they need to be able to claim that
they have the fastest CPU available in
the consumer space and that is why they
added those three more CPUs in the sack
with 14 core 16 4 and 18 core options
that they can state are obviously better
than what thread Ripper would be with
this paltry 16 cores and 32 threads it
doesn't really matter that their highest
end CPU cost $2000 all that matters is
like Nvidia with the Titan is that they
can say we have the fastest and that is
a marketing win again depending on how
you look at it and depending on the
teams of marketing and that's okay
actually in my opinion because look at
what competition from AMD has done in
this space from 2014 to 2016 Intel I'd
be 59 60 X which they upgraded to the 69
50k in those two years we got two more
cores at the top-end
Intel SKU now in one year from 2016 to
2017 they've gone from 10 to 18 that's a
pretty significant jump and I guess we
have to say thanks AMD but also of
course thank you to Intel because as
expensive as these may be and I'm sure
lots of people are going to argue in the
comments about the positioning of both
companies and everything it's more
options and it's obviously some very
powerful hardware that's coming out so
I'm excited to check it out
and I hope you guys are too if you
enjoyed this video of course hit the
thumbs up button I'll be back with more
coverage from Computex
what do you 17 here in Taipei Taiwan
very soon and a biggest final thanks to
my sponsors to Sorel g.skill EVGA MSI as
well as schoolmaster thanks for watching
guys we'll see attached</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
