event that would be perfect looking good
all right hello everyone and welcome to
Paul's hardware my youtube channel this
is my Cyber Monday livestream so I have
been gathering a bunch of cyber monday
deals I've been scouring around the
internet to try to find them the things
that I feel are good prices either
significantly marked down are good
products that I think are reasonably
priced and I'm gonna go through them
with you guys today so thanks all for
joining me
hopefully my audio is working properly
this time that that should be the case
but if it's not then somebody tell Kyle
to text me again if you guys weren't
watching when I did the live stream on
Friday I had my OBS settings a little
bit off because we were doing some
unique setup there before but anyway
before I get too sidetracked there is a
link in this video's description to the
Cyber Monday 2018 deals shared document
that's a read-only link it still says
Black Friday just because I used the
same doc that I used on Friday and I
updated it I have repeated some of the
deals and put them on there again and
then I've added more deals that I found
today and then also if you scroll all
the way down I've got the original Black
Friday deals there too
just so you can compare and I have left
some of those on this list for the for
Cyber Monday if the product is still
available for sale I am just gonna run
down this list for you guys today so if
you don't want to sit and listen to me
ramble feel free to just click that link
in the description to check out the
deals and bear in mind please at all of
the links are affiliate links so if you
click on the link and go through and buy
something at Amazon and Newegg
then I get a small Commission for that
so I just wanted to be a friend about
that and thank you for doing that
because that helps support my channel
and hopefully you guys get some benefit
by me sharing these deals with you guys
today - I'm gonna go by category so
we're going to start off with CPUs and
this is a 2700 X and it is still a
little bit on the more expensive side
when you compare it to some of the other
eight core eyes and options that are out
there but it is the cheapest that I've
seen the 2700 X I need to get the wraith
prism cooler on there so that's nice -
and I'm just double-checking
my livestream and it appears people can
see me and hear me and everything so
cool the volume cannot be turned up much
more unfortunately it's already about as
high as as it should probably go
so everyone gotta just you got to turn
up your volume I will be upgrading my
audio solution soon for that though all
right moving on though oh also bear in
mind a lot of these are limited time
deals only available for today so this
one's only available for 13 more hours
all right let's move on though we got
the 2700 it's only 15 dollars cheaper
than the 2700 X so you get the Wraith
spire instead of the other one and $15
pick your poison it's only a little bit
slower and you can overclock it to be
roughly the same
so there's another option there for you
too if you're really wanting to save 15
bucks
now the 2700 you can also get here for
$250 this is the new egg listing the
reason I put both of these on here was
because I had included the 2700 with my
Black Friday deals if you buy it at
Amazon right now though you cannot you
can also get an extra 30 bucks off right
30 bucks off where'd that go I shouldn't
double check this to make sure I'm sorry
the second listing at new egg is where
you can get an extra 30 bucks off you
got to use this coupon code right here
it's listed in the show Doc so so check
that out apply it and then you can get
the 2700 for $230 which makes it a
little bit more of a hard decision
compared to the 2700 X I still got the
1950 X on here just because I think this
is also a screamin deal for anyone who
wants to get into the high-end desktop
space only available for 13 more hours
but $450 for 16 cores and 32 threads
that's a great processor I've used it
multiple times for multiple things
here's a combo deal I wanted to include
the you know some Intel stuff although
it's not they're not really good prices
on the Intel stuff right now but the
8700 K is still a really good processor
for gaming and this $500 deal damage on
gets you a z3 70 - a asus motherboard
it's actually the z3 70 - a - and you
also gets an Intel 760 p-series 256 gig
SSD so for 500 bucks that's three of
your main components there a good little
SSD the CPU and the motherboard and it's
a solid motherboard - so it's not like
you're making too much of a sacrifice
for that so I thought that was a pretty
good deal
and it's available again for only 13
more hours so get up on it fast here's a
CPU cooler from thermal take the water
3.0 it's only 75 bucks that's a 25
that's about 45 dollars off the normal
price again only available for 13 more
hours this is a salt solid cooler with
an AC tech pump as well as some RGB
outfitting on there too so a good CPU
cooler for anyone who wants to upgrade
to that 75 bucks that's a good deal
here is another deal that I already
included on the on the Black Friday
deals
it's a Vegas 64 for $400 you get three
games along with it it's the blower
style Edition so you could get a better
cooler than this but for 400 bucks
that's still probably the best Vegas 64
deal that's out there that you can
actually buy there have been a few
others that have sort of flitted around
here and there but they come and go so
quickly when they're the fire sale deals
that I'm trying to only include stuff
here that you guys can actually click
links and hopefully by moving onto
graphics cards though we've got the rx
580 we've already moved on to graphics
cards but continuing Radeon or AMD
graphics cards and rx 580 for one
hundred and ninety dollars getting the
rx 588 gig by the way don't get fooled
and get on rx 584 gig but the RX 588 gig
down below $200 is a good deal and you
also get two games you get two of the
three game bundle that's still available
for that you can get an RX 570 here from
Newegg for $180 but then there's a $30
man mail-in rebate card which brings the
price down 250 bucks
that is also a very solid deal only if
you include that mail-in rebate card
though so you got to include that as
part of the value if you're not going to
do that then definitely just just get
this 580 instead that would be a better
choice
there was a 580 for as cheap as a
hundred and seventy dollars earlier
today but again that went out of stock
so I didn't include it here is a gtx
1066 gig i was hoping to find gtx 1066
gigs for cheaper than this because
supposedly nvidia has a glut of them
available right now but $200 is still a
solid choice for this if you've already
got a g-sync monitor or you just have
some you know you really like nvidia for
some reason then this would be a good
deal but honestly comparing it to the RX
v ats that are like you know 10 or 20
bucks cheaper it's a hard choice but
those of you who are stuck on the nvidia
side of things that is a good mid-range
nvidia graphics card
here's another gtx 1070 this was also
included in the Black Friday deals but
it's still available for sale for three
hundred and forty dollars and I'm just
trying to establish kind of the starting
off points for these mid to high-end
range graphics cards from Nvidia
so gtx 1070 with these that cheapest
1070 I saw was 320 no I actually saw one
for $2.99 but it was gone immediately
like I it was it was so quick it's just
like in a flash it was gone so this is a
solid choice for this one it's an atom
bar add-in board partner version two
from Asus so it's got a cooler on it
here is a GTX 1078 gig for three hundred
and thirty dollars if you include a $20
mil and rebate card once again so 350
marked down so so there you go this is
340 straight up this is 350 with a $20
million rebate card anyway they're both
very comparable cards 1078 gig if you
want to step up to a 1070 TI B&amp;amp;H has one
for 350 bucks oh yeah
also it's nice depending on where you
are located you might not pay sales tax
like in California which might be
something to consider if you're shopping
at Amazon that does charge sales tax in
most places
this is also as otech again aftermarket
cooler design on this with two fans so
that's a solid version of it too sweet
o currently not in stock but if you
order it now it should be in in three to
seven business days and you still get
the price here's a 1070 TI if you want
to step it up well I mean step it up in
price I guess this one's three hundred
ninety dollars so that the being h1 goes
out of stock then here's another another
option for you to put the 1072 yet this
one have anything special about it
1070 Ti where to go a gig sits the
Cerberus version it's 390 so I guess
that ZOTAC one is a better deal for
forty bucks less but there it is let's
move on I don't know I'm getting getting
my tabs completely mixed up up here all
right there's a 1070 TI there is the RT
X 2070 and this is also something that I
listed you can also add a promo code
right now CMA d0
and I believe that brings it down to
four hundred and eighty dollars so that
is a good price and here's where I was
looking for good deals on GTX 1080s
couldn't really find much which I was
also kind of surprised about so if
you're looking at a GTX 1080 or an RT X
2070 and they're about the same price
I'd say go for the RT X 2070 and 480
bucks it is a good price for that let's
move on to graphics re - motherboards if
you're trying to get in on the a m4
platform and you want a good
overclocking motherboard it's X 370 so
it's the first gen a m4 stuff but this
is a higher-end board that's been marked
down pretty significantly down 210 and
then there's also a mail-in rebate card
that brings it down to 80 bucks so it's
a really good board from MSI they did a
great job with this so yeah just thought
I'd include that as I was actually not
finding very many good motherboard deals
out there this is why I've also included
again from Brack Black Friday these III
70 board that I have here this was
actually 85 bucks it's jumped up five
dollars but still 490 it's a good deal
I've also rien cluded the EVGA x2 99 for
the wing K just because it's a really
good deal 450 bucks for anyone looking
in the intel's high-end desktop platform
and it's still in stock and still
available for sale that's pretty much
all I have for motherboards moving on to
storage this you can't get anymore
and I'm sorry I was trying to rush this
morning this was a lightning deal this
morning so never mind never mind about
this one lightning deal on Amazon this
morning for $18 short rudra 40 SSD but
not currently available anymore you get
the Floridan 80 gig version for 60 bucks
that's not an insane deal 500 gig class
SSDs you are about 50 bucks it's what
you should be looking for
so a good price on those here is
something that I brought up because I
actually bought two of them this morning
again it was a fast deal that sold out
quickly but the two terabyte I was
looking for a good deal on a two
terabyte SSD and MX 500 was 210 dollars
this morning so yes I bought two of them
I'm still linking to this in the
description earlier today they were
still taking orders for this but even
though it was it was it didn't stock and
they were gonna ship out later so um
refresh that if you're still looking for
it and again guys I will try to update
the doc
that's linked in the description with
more deals as they come in in the next
day or two so you know keep an eye on
there if you want to see updates here's
an alternative for you a one terabyte
SSD we're looking at a few one terabyte
SSDs in the hundred and twenty two
hundred and thirty dollar range
it's a SanDisk one hundred twenty bucks
one terabyte I can I can definitely
stand behind this drive I've used it and
it's a good one this is the drive that I
bought I think two years ago for a
hundred and sixty or a hundred and
seventy dollars so nice to down here is
another refresh from the Black Friday
deals still available for sale hundred
and twenty eight dollars for an eight
sixty Eva one terabyte really good deal
they're very solid drive although if
you're comparing it to the SSD to this I
would I would save eight bucks and get
the SanDisk instead here's the Intel 660
P series again a carryover from Black
Friday for seventy-five dollars for an
nvme Drive I think that's a great deal
for if I want to get class nvme for an
operating system included a hard drive
here and mechanical hard drive cuz
that's 8 terabytes for a hundred and
seventy two dollars lots of people still
need mass storage especially if you're
doing lots of work with video or
something like that
and this was a good price per terabyte
cost on a high-end higher-end spinning
mechanical drive it's also 7200 rpm I
have a link to a ballistic sport kit of
memory and moving on to memory by the
way for a hundred and four dollars
it was acting funky because it was
temporarily out of stock so that's why I
linked it to this page for it but you
can still add it to cart from here and
you should still be able to buy it and
get it shipped to you later about 104
dollars I'm just looking for really good
prices on 16 gig kits that are about
ddr4 3000 speed or better this is the
hundred and thirty dollar deal that I
also had on Black Friday still available
and in stock and this is just a very
widely compatible kit of memory works
with Rison and stuff also low profile
and a pretty basic design from Corsair
that's not to say you can't get better
deals on pretty comparable memory I
still have included a link to the team T
force Vulcan a 16 gig kit here the red
one this time since the black was out of
stock
although now for some reason this is not
available let's go home new egg you're
drunk oh no it says I don't notify maybe
this like sold out with the past ten
minutes I'm sorry sold out the gray kit
and now the black kit as well but you
know there's other other kits available
in the one hundred two hundred twenty
dollar range like the XP
gamax d-10 3000 megahertz kit 418 so
that one's like down there - if you need
some other options finally we got a 32
gig kits for 230 dollars I thought this
was interesting cuz g.skill was selling
16 gig kits for 3 $230 like a few months
back so if you're looking this is 2 by
16 by the way so now that not a quad
channel kit but if you're looking for
more memory on a mainstream platform or
an upgrade yeah there you go it's bright
red somebody that in mind power supplies
are next we've got an EVGA 75080 plus
gold power supply
you got Eclipse a coupon to get this one
but it should be 50 bucks 50 freakin
dollars for 750 water you plus cold
power supply from EVGA good deal and
then here's an EVGA supernova if you are
in need of high wattage these have gone
out of style since Bitcoin mining has
dropped in popularity or crypto mining
but it's a 1300 watt
EVGA supernova that usually sells for
260 dollars and it's down to 100 that's
a good deal to save a hundred and 60
bucks on that and then we got some
peripherals there's a Logitech G 6 1-3
which is a wireless mechanical keyboard
for $65 marked down from 129 here's a
Logitech MX MX master this was on sale
for $50 and unfortunately this might be
another one that has has has disappeared
in the brief moments of time between
when I set up all these deals and when
they actually came in stock anyway
though keep refreshing that and
hopefully it'll come back at some points
here's a Logitech G 9 10 Orion's spark
also talked about this one on Black
Friday but $90 for a keyboard that
usually costs 180 and it's a good one -
the Razer DeathAdder elite is still 40
bucks I still recommend this mouse it's
a very good Mouse HyperX cloud alpha
headset still $75 this is still one of
the best deals on an actually good
headset that I have seen so I've also
continued to include it I got a couple
monitors on sale at Amazon this is an
Asus 27-inch the larger size 1920 by
1080 a good starter monitor and it also
has some nice features like a 1
millisecond response time for $135 I
thought that was a good deal especially
for the larger size usually you can find
monitors at this resolution that are
smaller maybe in the 22 inch or 24 inch
range therefore 27 inches good deal and
then here is a great bang for the buck
gaming monitor for
and $70 from acer has really nice
features here it's 1920 by 1080 but it
is 24 inches it is 144 Hertz refresh
rate 1 millisecond response time and AMD
freesync so if you're looking to us for
something to pair up with like an RX 570
or 580 this would be a really really
good choice for that marked down from
230 good deal there and then I have a
few other miscellaneous items that are
still listed Samsung hundred twenty
eight gig microSD cards still 20 bucks
Logitech c920 - still 50 bucks and then
here's one more that I've added this
would be a great gift perhaps for
somebody maybe maybe a budding gamer
who's younger and needs a decent headset
to get off get up and running with
Logitech G 230 usually $60.00 mark down
to 25 I think that that's a great deal -
finally this is a last-minute addition
but I wasn't finding a whole lot of case
deals going around - for Black Friday
Cyber Monday stuff but this is a fractal
mesh if I see which new egg has for $75
it's only 15 bucks off but it's a really
good case very very popular very well
rated it looks nice and it also has good
air flow which is and it's also very
functional case which is apparently
something that's harder to find with a
lot of the more recent case designs that
have tempered glass everywhere but that
is my deals my cyberpunk idealist video
again guys I'm gonna be browsing the the
pier the the web I'm gonna browse the
interwebs and look for other deals
throughout the day today and for the
next few days so if I spot other deals
that seem good I will add them to that
dock so clicks the document link in the
description to look at the whole list or
all of the individual products are
linked down there too thank you guys
again once thank you guys once again for
watching this video I am streaming it
live that's why I'm not adding editing
out any of my flubs thumbs up if you
enjoyed it and you know click the links
in the description thanks everyone
good bye wait have to click the thing
over here to stop that was 11 minutes
