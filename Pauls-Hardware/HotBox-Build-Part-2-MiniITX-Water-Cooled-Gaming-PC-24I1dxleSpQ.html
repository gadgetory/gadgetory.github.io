the final stage of the build of my
wife's new computer we're calling it
hotbox
there it is right there in its current
stage of being built sniffs if you
missed part one check it out I'll link
it down in the description that's where
I kind of did all the assembly that you
see here as well as some preparation for
stage 2 which is going to be bending
some tubes for the liquid cooling loop
the custom liquid cooling loop and those
those tubes are all right there and then
I also have a few other things so this
is the part of the video where I'm going
to say the things that I'm going to do
and then a few moments I'll move on and
show you me actually doing it that'll be
exciting but a big thank you to ek of
course for their help and support with
this build I'm going to be using their
DIY kits for 10 and 12 millimeter inner
diameter tubing here right there and
that will help me with the cutting it
open and also Scout the little silicone
insert that you put in there while you
bend it also going to be doing some work
on the lighting for this stage so I've
got the NZXT hue I've already attached
it here to the little 3.5 inch and 2.5
inch drive mount in the fractal define
NOS and i'm already got the wiring set
up for this internally as well as far as
the power goes so fortunately that's
good to go
I do need to place these LEDs in there
though these are all magnetic which is
really an help they just they're
magnetized they just stick to things so
I'm going to put those inside of the
windowed side panel and of course get
that all wired up and then play around
with some of the lighting options the
Nutini run some power so fortunately I'm
just going to be able to get away with a
single molex connector here with three
plugs on the end two of these are going
to be for the pump as well as the fan
splitter that's in there and then the
last one I'm going to use this little
adapter I am going to have some ketchup
and mustard back there in the kill
management area sorry but this is to
plug in the 2.5 inch Kingston HyperX
savage SSD so the tubing is ready to go
if I managed to get through and Bend all
the tubes the directions that they're
supposed to go I have I think five total
bends to do so one's going to be from
the reservoir down to the pump Inlet
from the pump Inlet to the this radiator
here is already taken care of down
so out of that radiator and over and
into the graphics card then out of the
graphics card and up into the top
radiator out of the top radiator and
into the CPU and then out of the CPU
block into the reservoir again and then
of course I can use a little guy here to
fill everything up now around on the
back I have already installed that
savage SSD and I do have a little bit of
cable management still to do but I think
what I'm actually going to start out
with is a very slight repositioning of
my reservoir because I think if I just
got to drill one hole in here and I will
be able to basically take the reservoir
and ever so slightly shift it just ever
so slightly up and ever so slightly that
way so I think that will help out and
from there I can go ahead and start
bending my tubes I do have a few more
fittings still to put in place those are
all lined up right here and I think the
last part of this story to tell you is
well now to two last things one is I
don't think I'm going to use this flow
indicator I was maybe gonna put it
vertically like right there coming down
and then and then that would attach up
to this one but I don't know it just the
the finish isn't the same it's not a
nikkei part and it doesn't have the same
finish on the fittings so I don't know
it doesn't blend in quite as well so I
think I'm just going to skip that anyway
assuming I get all that done we'll move
on to the actual liquid so I'm going to
just do straight up distilled water
first to like test it and leak leak test
and everything from there I'll be using
some of these dies that I got and I
picked these up from performance pcs
this is primo chills intensifier bright
orange and this is Mayhem's orange dye
so folk have a couple options I might do
one or the other or might mix them both
together who knows I think that's enough
introduction though I hear the heat gun
calling my name so let's get it on the
final phase building hot box
this DIY kit saw two sandpaper in case
you need to sand the tube if it's too
thick I hope I don't have to sand my
tube the soapy water has proved
ineffective this is as far as I as I was
able to shove it in there so like I'm
gonna have to sand the tube
my first Bend is the new thicker tubing
it's a bit of a challenge I think I
might actually switch to high heat for
this turned out okay but I'm not going
to use it at this little warps in the
outer part of the bend not quite up to
standards oh wow this is literally like
two three hours into this this is my
first usable Bend I tried to go with
what I thought was going to be the easy
one first
that's this thicker tubing really is
pretty challenging to work with
especially on a tight space with tight
curves so it took me a lot to get what I
wanted to anyway it's going up they on
the top left time to install it time to
move out from right on top of this hot
heat gun
you
lauric is it is the morning after and I
have good news and bad news
well mostly just good news and then some
other news we'll start with the good
news first I got all these tube bends
done and the tubes installed and it has
now been running the pumps running right
now full speed and it's been going on
overnight or at least yeah for good I
don't know 14 16 hours now it's hard
wired up or hot wired up in the back to
that power supply and everything is
great so leak testing is a go I don't
have any leaks that is to say and you
know that that's all good news now the
other news is that I've made a decision
to sort of extend this project because
ultimately there's a few things that I'm
just not a hundred percent happy with
now this is going to involve getting
some additional hardware because I think
I'm going to need maybe another
extension or two another little bendy
piece or two to go in there fittings
that that is and I'm going to need to
get those and I'm not going to be able
to get those before Computex so I'm
going to need to follow up this video
again and a couple more weeks at least
so I will have you know kind of a final
version of it for now um but let me go
and talk about what I actually want to
change and that is really almost all of
the actual tube bends that I did what
happened last night was I spent the
first probably two and a half three
hours failing pretty much over and over
again I was trying to get this first
been done up in there in the back
usually you want to start with something
that is either further back so you know
it won't be blocked by the other tubing
or something that is you know fairly
simple I thought that one would be
fairly simple it wasn't just because
this is 16 millimeter tubing it's
thicker it's a little bit harder to work
with I found I needed to use more heats
that or just I was pulling too much
wattage from this entire circuit in
general so the heat gun wasn't getting
as hot on the low setting anyway it was
just a fair amount of trial and error to
start out with as you might be able to
see down here there's a lot of my failed
attempts many over there that's not even
all of them I have more
I have more right here um you know it
was it was a learning experience like
this one this one came so close
except for that crappy part right there
this one was an attempt for that right
there and it actually turned out quite
good I think it actually turned out a
little bit better than what today right
now because the one that's there right
now I think goes too far that way this
isn't straight up and down so this this
Bend you know I wish was more straight
up and down I might want to do a kink in
it here to get it to go more straight
into the radiator this one also could be
a little bit more vertical here it comes
out further than I wanted this one I'm
actually fairly happy with it does have
kind of a bulge right there but you know
I kind of like the way this one turned
out that was a kind of a last-minute
decision to I was just going to go more
straight across into here and I realized
that just the proximity of this was
going to make that really difficult to
do the bends properly and so I put the
fitting on there and was able to do this
you bend out there in it I thought that
turned out pretty good well in the back
was the first one and I was just like oh
thank god I finished this so I put it in
there and it's just it's a little bend
and McTwist job and you know it's also
just a little warped and then this one
here is just kind of lazy you know it
doesn't really go that way in that way
and it doesn't really go intentionally
that way it just kinda yeah it's like
yeah move over there it's straight here
in here but anyway it is something that
takes a lot of practice and I did learn
from a very good teacher in js2 sense
but um you know this was definitely
challenging so the other thing I wanted
to do is figure out a better drain
situation and I actually think that with
those fittings that I have back here I
can set that up I can pop out a drain
maybe straight down through the bottom
of the case so that's another thing that
I want to do again maybe in a couple
weeks after I get back from Computex so
for now I will close off this video by
showing you some initial testing with
the orange dye some closing off of the
cable management in the back and closing
things up and then you know the kind of
finish built oh you know what I didn't I
didn't talk about
LEDs my NZXT hue is installed I got it
in the back at least
right turn over there so he's installed
right there and it's all wired in so I
got power to it and all that good stuff
comes out right here and I'm just using
the magnets right now to go along this
side and then it's connected up to
another one that goes along the base
which you probably can't see very well
but there it is that goes along there
and then I'm going to use this little
cable here to attach that to the bottom
of the one in the actual side panel and
then I'm going to put that on the side
panel for the rest of them it goes up to
the top I'm gonna I have a weird way of
kind of pushing that into the case but
it's actually not very visible so that
will go up this the left side and across
the top of the case so I will be able to
have the full wraparound experience that
you get with the NZXT hue which does
some pretty cool effects you can do when
it when it's all up and running anyway
that's all for me at least for talking
portion of this video thanks for
watching guys and here's the rest of the
build for now
you're a bro</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
