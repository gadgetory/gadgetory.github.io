Hardware today this video marks a huge
transition for my channel because as we
all know graphics cards are just
insanely expensive right now memory for
computers is also really overpriced
so basically PC gaming is dead we should
all give up on it move on to something
else
something that we can do with our time
and for me of course since I'm a
youtuber I got to make that money so I
went and I looked at the different
categories of YouTube videos that I
might be able to make that have lots of
views going in on them right now and
we'll make it I mean that's everywhere
right it's just people they put on
makeup and then they post this video on
the internet so that's what I'm gonna do
changing my channel name now to Pauls
skincare and makeup so I hope you guys
will stick around along for the ride I
imagine it'll be right up your alley at
the same time so now getting started
with the makeup I'm gonna assume you
guys have already moisturized that's
step one and I'm gonna start off with a
primer because it's very important to
prime before you do all the other things
this is the Porefessional matte rescue
by benefits it has the benefits of
giving you coverage covering up the
pores and also a matte finish so that
you can apply all of the other stuff on
top of it put it on the back of your
hands okay I remember a little of this
stuff goes a long way
alright now this is gonna help prevent
places where you might get oily and
shiny of course want to stay pay special
attention to your t-zone which is the
area on your face it looks like a tea
no glossy finishes allowed on Paul's
skin care and makeup channel next
product I'm taking a look at today is
from Smashbox this is the 24-hour photo
finish shadow primer as we all know
anti-aliasing shading is very important
to the finished rendered product so want
to make sure that especially around the
eyes that we get that all set up because
the eyes are the window to the soul put
it on the back of my hand I'm gonna I'm
gonna push it around a little bit so
warming that up and I will glide on
there and then if you have hooded
eyelids I don't know what that means but
as you can see glides on because I've
put it on my finger first and you can
probably already see how much better my
eyes look right now right eyes are
primed next up of course we got to move
on to the eyeshadows so I have two
collections here from Too Faced this is
the just peachy mattes collection
they're all peach shades and I believe
they actually smell they smell like it
actually smells like peach actually it
smells like a Cabbage Patch Kid you guys
ever have Cabbage Patch Kids when your
anyway this is the Too Faced sweet peach
so yeah as you can see we have a wide
variety of colors in here
right there so any choice that you want
to make your face you can make your face
that color actually this mainly for the
eye shadow so now when faced with a
difficult decision like this I find the
best thing to do is just read the names
of the different colors because they all
have names that usually aren't colors
they're usually only vaguely related to
colors like tempting there's a color
called tempting which isn't a color
charmed I'm sure we have cobbler candied
peach peach tea peach punch so pick the
name of the color that you like best and
usually that's what will match best with
your complexion it's a very highly
scientific process that they go about
when naming all the different colors
just something to keep in mind that's
why you watch all the skincare and
makeup so to apply this I have my morphe
e22
brush which has a nice rounded tip on
the ends and we're gonna start with the
transition color and for that I'm gonna
go with peach tea because peach tea is
let's go ahead and just get some on the
brush here tap off the excess we can see
there's not a lot of fall-off here with
the peach T fall out there's not a lot
of fall out with the peach T which is
good that's a good thing
now I'm gonna pay it like where the
creases in my eyeball here hold on
I'm applying using a windshield wiper
motion which helps skim away all the
excess I also provide even application
across the hooded area of my eye so my
transition color is now applied I'm
going to go into my next color still
using the same brush more for u-22 just
knock that off a little bit and I think
from the peach T here we're gonna move
down to fresh-picked cuz you know I'm
all about that fresh fresh produce again
just just loading up the brush just a
little bit tap tap tappy there and then
I'm gonna apply it on top of and blend
in with my initial transition color like
so as you can see I'm twitching my eye
in a very rapid fashion that helps with
the equal dispersion of the eye shadow
next up for the outer V part of the
eyelid we're switching over to a more
feet East 17 brush it's a little bit
narrow work and allow us to get a little
bit more detail in there and here you're
just going for another accent color on
the outside edge I was originally
thinking about some chocolate dipped but
you know I want to live dangerously and
maybe maybe going out later tonight so
I'm gonna actually switch over to the
peach sangria here which has a more
deeper rich maroon I want to say that's
a maroon some on the end of the brush
there's a little tap a little bit more
fall off a little bit more fall off with
the sangria a little bit more fall out
the sangria and here I'm just going to
be paying attention to that outer V in
the eye I'm starting in working my way
out pop of color oh yeah
[Laughter]
yeah look at that gonna get in these
it's really providing some accents
unlike the creases at the outer edges of
my eyes
okay and now to round things out and
provide some balance I'm still using
using the morphe 17 here but just gonna
go along the bottom edge of the eyelid
and got to be very careful here just
slide your brush right here goes oh yeah
that's subtle
oh yeah so pretty obviously I look
amazing already but just to finish
things off and give a nice pop I'm gonna
take a sparkly color which we have some
nectar in here it's got a bit of a
shimmer to it I'm just gonna get a
little that all that on my pinky here
I'm just gonna lightly accent that oh
wait that was the inside inner corner of
the eye it's like that oh yeah that's
really making a pop there ever so gently
dab oh yeah seen that and that really as
you can see gives that nice shimmer
finishes interesting finishes things off
wonderfully also for a balancing effect
here all right we're gonna put another
little pop of that shimmer right here
under the arch under the highest point
of the eyebrow just a little bit a
little bit more shimmer in there next up
we're moving on to some eyeliner and
since this is more of a daytime look
maybe a day-to-night look we're going
with the Smashbox always sharp
waterproof cold liner and this is in a
French Navy so not quite as dark but
just gonna unscrew this and then along
the eyelash line just right above it's
gonna slowly poke at it just a little
bit at a time and they're just you're
just filling in just ever so gently
filling in the space in between the
eyelashes no that's coming out great
that looks amazing
don't worry about messing up here you
can always smudge it out later
so don't don't give yourself a hard time
and you know for if you're just getting
started
you might be a little nervous about this
type of application it's very close to
the eye but don't worry after enough
practice you can eventually get to the
point where I am where it's just second
nature just provide you guys a more
accurate simulation I've intentionally
gone and done maybe not the best job in
here so I've got that I've got a smudger
here and this is from morphe the e30 5
and I'm just gonna go ahead and smudge
that down there so anywhere it's built
up I'm just pushing it back where it's
supposed to be back into the Isle
eyelashes and the space in between
as you can see any any errors mistakes
you may have made along the way I just
they just blend right in so the eye is
done to perfection we're moving on to
the rest of the face so I have the Kat
Von D locket setting powder right here
and this one see right there I'm just
going to open up just got this upper
portion here where some of the powder
will reside I'm just gonna get just ever
so much we're just switching over to an
Ecotools powder brush here just got a
little bit on the tip there and then
we're gonna take the lid and just give
it a nice swirl around there to evenly
distribute the powder and the powder
goes on the face and we don't need to
apply this over the eyes those already
got makeup on them but of course so make
sure have a nice even distribution
paying attention to the t-zone of course
I understand the nose as part of the
t-zone looking good next remove you got
to contouring and we're gonna want to
pay attention to here's our cheekbones
we want to highlight the cheekbones
giving ourselves a strong appearance of
chiseled cheekbones makes it makes you
look more like a model or an actor or
something so you want to kind of look at
where the top of your ear is and your
nose and that's kind of where your
cheekbone usually is you can feel for it
and then just under the cheekbone here
that's where I'm aiming for so switching
over to a shade and light brush and this
is from Kat Von D D Kat Von D switching
over to this shade and light brush from
Kat Von D and I'm actually going to be
using the darker colors down here maybe
angle and this is the Park Avenue
princess palette which is one of my
favorites I'm also using this as a
mirror so set that back up real quick
dark side light side
again just getting just getting a
dusting of it on the brochure on tap off
the excess and then just from from right
about under the eye to the outside we're
just gonna give us a nice nice bit of
darkened contour for the cheekbone and
now switching back to the Ecotools brush
just going to buff out any harsh lines
here real quick so make sure it's more
of an even transition between the
shading and the area where it's not
applied moving on to blush of course
that's next and for that we have the
Milani powder blush right here this is a
blossom time rose it has a bit of a roll
rose gold finish to it so I'm just gonna
pop this open and we're gonna use the
morphe four brush to apply and it's got
such a lovely bit of a contoured rose
there and on the outside I hate to put
any blemish on it but just a just a
touch there again to apply some to the
brush just bit onto the brush again and
then just apply right above the contour
line just to give yourself a nice nice
healthy glow in the upper cheeks and
then to the outside
and of course no look is going to be
complete without your highlighter so
here from morphe I have a new palette
this is called babe in paradise
babe in paradise and this is actually
done in collaboration with britman rock
to shut up so here we have another nice
set of different colors baby girl as
what I'm going for here it looks mostly
white but it's gonna give a nice little
pop of color this actually comes with a
little fan brush as well so we're just
gonna get a little bit a little bit
there under the brush one more time
they're just gonna very gently apply
this right above the cheekbone just just
for that little a little bit of
highlight up there they accent those
cheekbones it's very important
cheekbones are one of the most important
bones in the face and that's that's
looking great and the highlighters apply
and finishing off the look of course we
got a got to do the lips so for that
I've got the colour-pop lippie stix this
is the inkblot matte color and this is
from their Butterfly Collection so it's
gonna be sort of a Matt rose color here
and it's got a nice very very delicate
applicator here so I'm just gonna put on
lipstick it's the Joker look I ever told
you how I got these scars obviously my
application was perfect but we're a
little too matte here so we're gonna
finish this off with the ultra glossy
lip from colour-pop and oh yeah
it's got kind of a goopy applicator now
for this one I would just want to apply
a little bit to the center of the lips
and then we'll just smack lips to apply
it properly around shiny
well alright guys this is the finished
look and I'm sure a lot of you at home
