point that's that's the mountain over

to run a land on top of a mountain all
you need is all this stuff and cane

second thoughts I might not make it we
could just go back we could go back we
could have food and that's no okay
Logan any predictions we're gonna climb
a mountain
why am i recording myself right now this
this is not a friendly stretch of path
don't sit down Adil
you will you'll regret it yeah manzil
there you go you can do it I think
that's the summit up there although it
might be a false limit that's a false
summit that's a all right but we're
we're getting there we're partway up
exhausting but anytime you get too tired
you just got to kind of take a look
around stop and catch your breath oh my
god it is gorgeous up here beautiful
so I'm now up above the treeline I think
we're more than halfway done with the
elevation gain so I'm happy about that
keep going why do we climb because we're
insane several young nerds with
ill-advised notion fingers for claw grip
palm grip challenging the rock
challenging deathmatch passion affair
between Tek syndicate in the mountain
that syndicate is on the mountain get
that detectors on the tech is on it
takes him to Kazan hurry but you the
boss Yeti do the Falls one and then how
I like your boots man hey Jimmy thanks I
was gonna say I kinda like your boots
too it's a pretty nice day look at Weiss
absolutely good taste my friend
excellent choice
easy what helped you get up the mountain
yeah okay lover boys get a room
so we're still getting close II
malignantly ok guys I'm like right in
the middle of what I've been told is the
hardest part of this hike that is not
the top right there that is a false
summit now we can see Jimmy and our
scientist enormous
- tech tip screw further up we're really
high up I think we're about 13,500 so
right now and it might be starting to
snow
I was hiking over the snow banks right
here I'm seriously exhausted the thin
air is really taking a toll something on
this side show you that let's stop right
there just all right let's get a little
bit to go I'm almost a
everybody we're at the top and I'm sorry
I'm not gonna be able to go this is just
a massive cloud that's blowing into us
snowing on us we didn't make it here
have some fantastic views play the LAN
party right here on the rocks you can
check that out on Tek syndicate or new
ITV or Linus tech tip so there's will be
videos Austin Evans channel as well but
point is we did it and the other point
is let me get that this time this way
Brandon made it for any minute too
so we are now on our way down I'm sorry
I didn't get too much footage at the top
but we were setting up for the LAN party
and then we and then the snow came so we
had snow came it was complete chaos we
had we had to make a quick exit yeah but
we did get mission accomplished
yep run our way back down the mountain
and this is probably going to be the
last footage of this actual hike because
I am really really worn out yeah I think
y'all I think we all are so tired it's
now the day after the hike we're all
feeling sore we're going to find food
check out that sunburn now on Kane's
legs oh there it is that's the mountain
that we hiked up to that's Mount Elbert
we were we were up on the top like right
up there

interesting day we've been relaxing
recuperating we've now moved over here
to a place in the woods near Mount
Elbert we're going to do some some final
recordings here exit interviews that
sort of thing it's been an excellent
experience a great day everyone
