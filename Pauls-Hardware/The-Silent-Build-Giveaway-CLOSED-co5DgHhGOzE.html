Paul's hardware today's video is finally
my hundred thousand subscribers thank
you giveaway video that I promised back
when i did my hundred thousand
subscriber thank you video so i hope i'm
not dwelling on this hundred thousand
subscriber thing too much but the upshot
is that you guys have now a chance to
win this system right here on my left
this is the silent build if you didn't
catch the video where i built this
system it's called building a silent
computer and i'll post a link to that in
the description but basically what you
could win if you win this contest is
this whole system and i will go over
what is included and then i'm going to
go over some of the terms and conditions
and actually how to enter it all that
good stuff so keep watching or if you
want to just get right to it click on
the link in the description go over to
the gleam vaio page and enter inside the
giveaway system we have of course an
intel core i7 4770k cpu at an asus z87
promo for memory we have Corsair eight
gig kit to four gigs sticks of Corsair
Vengeance low profile black ddr3 memory
also from corsair we have a neutron GTX
240 gig SSD we also have from antec
quite a few things so the case of course
the antec p180 antec edge 650 watt the
cooler is the antec kuhler h2o 950 CLC
which is already installed there nice
and sturdy so that's good for shipping
and then also from antic we have their
troop quiet fans up at the front now I
had a gtx 760 in here originally but
zotac jumped in here and they said hey
let's give your fancy prize-winner a new
graphics card so i'm going to ship
against the system zotac is going to
ship you one of these which is an zotac
amp edition gtx 960 two gigabyte card
these are very quiet cards and they're
nice and small and as you can see color
scheme wise fits in beautifully right
there so that just install that you'll
be good to go the system i've already
used with the gtx 760 for gaming and
stuff it has no problem with gaming i
even did a bit of streaming on it over
from kyle's place when i brought it over
there so a great system forever happens
to win it now big question I always get
for these giveaways is is it
international and unfortunately this
giveaway is not if you go to the gleam
I owe entry page and you are
international it will let you enter
because i don't have the paid for
version of that however this is only for
us and canada so please keep that in
mind if you do win and you don't have a
US or canada address i will ask you to
withdraw and i'll choose another winner
i do have a reason for this it's not
just as I don't like international
people i love international people in
fact a lot of you have been already
buying shirts from my store which is
fantastic the reason i can't do
international is because i need to ship
this thing shipping to the lower 48
states even is probably going to run me
about 50 to 100 bucks if I ship it
internationally it's going to double
triple or quadruple that amount and then
on top of that whatever country I get
shipped to is going to assess the value
of this and then when it arrives to you
most likely depending on what country
you live and of course you would be
charged like up to fifty percent of the
cost of this just to accept delivery
I've had these issues shipping
internationally before so that's why in
the future what I'm going to try to do
is work with vendors to get them to ship
stuff directly because they have
international shipping things worked out
more so than I do so international
subscribers thank you so much for
watching all of my content I'm sorry
that you're not eligible for this
giveaway but I do appreciate you
watching anyway and I will try to do
something international for y'all in the
future one other thing to note is that
you need to be 18 or over in order to
enter this contest again I have nothing
against any of you folks who are
following them out there who are under
the age of 18 you guys are all fantastic
and you've already got a leg up in life
by following my channel at such a young
age but if you are going to enter just
for legal purposes talk to a parent or
guardian and have them enter for you and
then we can work all that good stuff out
and lastly of course is how to enter
this giveaway there's a link at the top
of the video description right there
it's to a gleam IO page where I have a
giveaway a page set up so you get one

get in touch with you if you win you get
another couple entries I think I have
