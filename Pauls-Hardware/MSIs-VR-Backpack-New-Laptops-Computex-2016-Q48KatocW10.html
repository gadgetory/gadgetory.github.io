sponsored by fractal design msi and
g.skill guys we're not the MSI booth msi
is one of my sponsors so i'm going to do
a couple videos for them the first one
is going to be about a product that you
might not have seen coming we said a few
of these here and there zotac had one we
saw gigabyte show off one this is a VR
backpack but it's not really like a
backpack with a laptop in it or
something like that it's actually a tiny
little chassis but they built to be able
to fit on your back it's got integrated
batteries if you seem like the vortex
like that'll guy right there they
basically took a lot of the internals of
that and kind of repurposed them to fit
inside a very small backpack the battery
life will be about 90 minutes we're told
it will charge in about 20 to 30 minutes
so you actually get be able to get a
decent amount of playtime out of this
I've got some footage here of Kyle
playing the the lab he's shooting I
assume any shooting that I don't I don't
know what the hell kyle is doing right
now he looks ridiculous anyway I didn't
get a chance to try this out
unfortunately Pakal said it was very
lightweight it basically untethered you
from that annoying ass cable tether that
you have to deal with in it when you're
playing with an HTC vive in particular
so without that cable tether you have
free range of movement get a bit more of
an immersive environment a couple of the
bonus features it's got all the
connectors for like the headset which
are right at the top of the backpack in
the back so everything is self-contained
it's even got a couple holsters on the
side for your VR wands and controllers
that you might be using with HTC vive so
a very cool device they're still
refining it but their toll we're told it
will be coming out later this year let's
move on to some msi laptops we're
starting off with this one right here
which is actually a workstation laptop
the WT 72 6qn pro VR VR at a laptop and
a workstation laptop does that make any
sense well it kind of does the actual
GPU that's in here is the quadro m 5500
which might not be the best for gaming
per se but you are going to be able to
do lots of stuff like GPU compute
applications on it so if you're a VR
developer for one or if you're
developing things in VR which is another
thing if you're doing like actual I
don't know they have autocad for vr
that's up a thing ever you designing
something like you're building cars or
whatever you have a concept you could
actually actually develop it in VR and
you could use this kind of laptop to
give yourself a greatly enhanced GPU
performance especially
for work station style workloads and
after the workstation stuff though let's
move on to some laptops you guys might
want to play some games on this is the
GS 32 with the gaming dock mini they've
redesigned this gaming duck for this
tiny of the laptop laptop screen size is
13.3 inches but back in this little dock
back here you could basically install
any graphics card you want they've
redesigned that they've made it smaller
they also have appetite for proprietary
connector at the back there so you get
full connectivity via PCI Express for
the GPU that you install there's other
features too but there's more stuff to
talk about so let's move this way this
is a GE 62 m also redesigned to be a
little bit slimmer a little bit more
svelte so they've basically removed the
optical drive from this one to give
folks who didn't need an optical drive a
bit of a thinner and lighter laptopping
experience it's also very difficult to
hear let me do this there we go see I
only have one hand to work with here
guys alright moving that align we have
the GT 62 so we've seen the gt60 this is
this is 62 it has been updated and
graduated you got a 6-10 6 gen intel
core i7 processor the nvidia what is
being called latest generation graphics
card hmm that is some very very
interesting wording on that particular
chart there so this might be using a GPU
that we can't even tell you what it is
or where or what it does yet I guess we
can show you what it does it apparently
works to display an image on the screen
anyway though the GT 62 again has a
slightly redesigned chassis still got
the full brushed metal look on the
outside and i'm told that they have more
USB ports now let's finish up with this
one the Big Daddy the GT 83 s is what
we're looking at here now I'm not sure
why I maasai keeps trying to convince me
not to have a desktop computer anymore
but they keep doing such a pretty damn
good job with their desktop replacements
it makes it kind of a compelling option
so you have a lot of the features that
we might have seen before such as the
integrated mechanical keyboard the
numpad over there which I can also work
as a trackpad which is pretty cool you
still have an access panel where you can
access the internal components they have
completely redesigned the actual
structure of the chassis here so
particularly in the back look how much
ventilation you have going on here you
got ventilation basically on all
all three sides left to right and as
well as all the way across the back so
you're going to have tons and tons of
heat dissipation which is good because
this has quite a lot of hardware wedged
into it six generation Intel Core i7
processor I mention of different ones of
those available again and video latest
generation graphics card and SLI which
is the continued mystery of what the
heck they're talking about with that
again that information is still not
disclosable by us but a few other specs
it's got a 1920 x 1080 screen its IPS up
to 512 gigabyte nvme m2 SSD as well as
one terabyte hard drive and then you can
have up to 64 gigs of memory in this
thing so this is an absolute beast if
you need to like edit videos while you
play games and do auto cad work on the
road this is probably what you'd want to
take with you maybe something like that
but anyway the GT 83 s again guys it's
pretty beastly laptop and hey if I
couldn't use a desktop I'd probably go
with something like this but that's all
for this video thank you guys so much
for watching I'll be back very soon with
more coverage and computex 2016 hit the
thumbs up button while you're on your
way out of this video may be over to the
next one maybe check out Kyle's video
he's here with me actually he's working
the camera right now hi Kyle yeah he's
doing a great job but guys final special
thanks to my sponsors fractal design msi
and g.skill we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
