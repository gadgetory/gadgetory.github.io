special relationship Corsair purchases
obscene amounts of cherry MX mechanical
switches to use in Corsair keyboards and
cherry and turn provides Corsair with
exclusives such as the exclusive use of
RGB LED Cherry MX switches a couple
years back now cherien's a new switch
developed in collaboration with Corsair
specifically for gaming the Cherry MX
speed switch and if you want to know how
fast it is you're going to have to
purchase a Corsair keyboard at least
during their exclusivity period for the
next six months today I'm going to be
taking a look at the brand new Corsair
k70 rapid-fire RGB featuring the also
brand new Cherry MX speed switches and
yes they still have RGB LEDs so Corsair
has just launched this full-size k70
rapid-fire keyboard as well as a 10
keyless k 65 rapid fire both using the
Cherry MX speed switch with RGB LEDs and
costing 160 $9.99 for the k70 RGB
rapid-fire and 149 99 for the case 65
RGB rapid-fire that's MSRP let's start
off with a closer look at these speed
switches though Cherry's all new
switches have a 45 gram actuation force
and one point two millimeter actuation
distance making them around 40% faster
than cherry MX Reds according to the
marketing copy from Corsair it's a
linear switch meaning it has smooth
travel from top to bottom and no tactile
bump or clicky sound so similar Cherry
MX blacks or reds but not as stiff and
with less travel distance to actuate
compare this to Cherry MX browns which
have a two-millimeter actuation distance
and 55 gram actuation force and you can
see our Corsair gets the 40% number from
its 1.2 / - that not put too fine a
point on it Corsair isn't the first to
go for minimal actuation distance and a
keyboard though logitech's G series of
mechanical keyboards for example use
their Romer G switches with a 1.5
millimeter actuation distance and 45
gram actuation force just remember
travel distance is how far far the key
moves from top to bottom to bottom out
completely
whereas actuation distance is how far
the key needs to travel to register the
keystroke comparing the Cherry MX speed
switches on the K 70 rapid-fire to the
Cherry MX red switches on my K 95 which
features the same general
design I found that the travel distance
for each key to bottom out is different
but only by about a millimeter the MX
Reds start at 15 millimeters high and
bottom out at 11 millimeters so they
travel four millimeters the M X speeds
which is also started out at 15
millimeters high but they bottomed out
at 12 millimeters meaning they only move
three millimeters which is perceptively
different while typing if you bottom out
each keystroke it is subtle though and I
had to measure just to be sure
as for the speediness of the switch
remember that most mechanical switches
actuate and send the keystroke to the
system well before the key actually
bottoms out so if you pressed both keys
at the exact same time the MX speed
switch would register the keystroke
after the key has moved one point two
millimeters and the MX red would
register the keystroke after moving two
millimeters down it's difficult to nail
down precisely how much faster it is
without some high-speed camera work of
course there is 40% faster explanation
while being based on math is definitely
dripping with least a little bit of
marketing hyperbole I will say though
that like high refresh rate hundred and
forty-four Hertz monitors and fast pace
PC gaming it's often just about being
first whether it's being the first to
see the next rendered frame from your
GPU or the first to hit the attack or
fire key on your keyboard and the MX
switches all else being equal will be
first in that button-pushing race even
if it's a matter of microseconds moving
on to the rest of the keyboard though
accessories include a manual and
warranty info a key cat puller and 10
extra textured key caps for the WASD
area the K 70 rapid-fire sports the same
design and brushed aluminum finish as
the k70 RGB that preceded it which isn't
a bad thing at all while it doesn't have
the trough that the keys are recessed
into like the Corsair straight for the
cooler master master Keys Pro that I
recently reviewed which gives those
keyboards the ability to have a white
backplate that's underneath that kind of
reflects more of the RGB light up this
design does have its advantages the
clear switch housings allow the RGB LEDs
to shine through brilliantly even from
the sides and the absence of a trough
beneath means that cleaning is much
easier whether you're doing it quick
dust off with canned air or you're
actually removing all the key caps to
give the undercarriage a bit of the old
house your father I really like the
Corsair has added a USB pass-through to
this keyboard that's a very nice upgrade
compared to the previous case 70 RGB and
a feature that always
earns bonus points with me there's also
a four position polling rates which
which you'll probably keep in the
fastest position but it is super helpful
for BIOS and UEFI compatibility the keys
themselves provide good illumination
through the key caps and I approve of
the choice of font also the spacebar is
textured which will help you find it
with your thumbs a little bit more
easily and there's a soft finish wrist
rest included as well on the bottom are
for height adjustment feet allowing you
to work with a positive or negative
tilts or simply raise the entire
keyboard up by an inch or so finally the
top right area has dedicated media
controls including the knurled barrel
style volume control knob which I really
like lighting and windows lock buttons
and all of these controls have RGB
backlighting in them as well meaning
that every visible light on this
keyboard has RGB control and that's just
how it should be done
good job Corsair but how do you control
the RGB LEDs for that you need Corsair
software and you'll find many people
have a love-hate relationship with the
Corsair utility engine application the
software is very capable and
customizable but also can be daunting
based on the sheer volume of options
available it's still pretty much the
same software so I will spare you the
full guide for that feel free to check
out Kyle's tutorial that I will link
down in the video's description I'm just
showing off some of the presets here and
more are available for download from
Corsairs website some are just cool
lighting schemes and others are set up
for specific games like csgo League of
Legends or world of warcraft if you're
willing to plow through the learning
curve you can edit your own effects
setup complex macro sequences or try out
built-in effects like gradient ripple
and wave this is undoubtedly the most
full-featured lighting control software
in its class but again with great
capabilities comes great complexity if
you really don't want to mess with the
software though you can browse through
and import profiles that have been
created and shared by other Corsair
keyboard users and that's a library that
is growing every day so where does that
leave us put simply this is a very nice
keyboard you'll probably like a lot of
you're a gamer and even more if you're
into Cherry MX red or Cherry MX black
switches since they have a very similar
feel I'm actually curious if there's a
speed switch version in the works with a
tactile bump or click for fans of MX
Browns greens or blues but no official
word on that yet beyond the switches the
keyboard design build quality and
features are all top-notch and have no
problem recommending
seventy rapid-fire RGB as for cons it's
worth noting that these switches are not
as good for typists as depth of travel
distance is actually one of the features
of mechanical switches that sets them
apart from rubber dome keyboards if
you're used to typing lightly as well
and you don't bottom out the keys these
switches might take some getting used to
that is all for this review though thank
you guys so much for watching and if you
