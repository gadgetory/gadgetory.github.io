hardware this is a Monday upload which
is kind of weird for me but I didn't
really do like my full normal allotment
of videos this week and I got this
mysterious package in the mail today
which doesn't happen to me too often so
I don't know I'm either being like
swindled or perhaps the Illuminati have
found out where I live
or this is an elaborate PR like a PR
what do you call it a PR scheme to try
to get more attention to something but I
have no idea what that something is so
so far it's working so anyway this is
what arrived earlier and I've actually
already taken this out of the box but I
try to reassemble it there for you guys
so you'd have the same experience I did
also a great job FedEx by the way at
least this made getting this thing out
of the box not too difficult anyway so I
was inside is this this Pelican case
right here which is a nice perfectly
usable Pelican case that I'm totally
gonna use so hey that's a bonus trade
are there
you got this 10 logo here on the front
and then of course it's latched close
thankfully it wasn't locked and opening
it how do Pelican cases work I feel like
this should be easier than it is being
it's cuz they come only open when
they're facing you that's probably hey I
I can't I can't open the case it's it's
locked itself maybe there's some sort of
special thing going on to where the case
knows when it's being presented to
people that shouldn't see it wasn't I
was not expecting this to be like the
alright here we go here we go
squeeze then open alright so basically
you open the box like so and then inside
you have this this thing mysterious
metal triangle of I don't know I don't
know what that is it's a trying that's
like it's got the Triforce in there
something in a hexagon
there's a mysterious envelope and then a
directions to go to a webpage or
something like that
I of course fully investigated to find
out if there's anything else hidden down
in the depths below but now other it's
it's a pelican case so the Pelican case
stuff is in there setting that aside we
have this which again is it's fairly
interesting design I have my code on
here nine four seven cm x six you and I
have not entered this code yet I have
done a little bit of research on this
unlock your puzzle your piece of the
puzzle at order of 10.com slash
uncertainty maxim and i have to enter
this code that they put on this thing
and then in my little envelope of
mystery here I also have a card with
this with this text written on it we are
the inquisitive the codebreakers the
truth seekers for centuries we have
studied the patterns that govern the
universe and the rules that drive our
perceptions of reality we toil in secret
pushing the boundaries of possibility
keeping our work underground until the
world is ready the days come when you're
calling on you and your followers to
join us on a mission to unleash the
quantum leap a quantum leap forward a
power so great it will change the way we
see in this box is one of six keys
follow the trail and reap the rewards
game everything all right so game
everything right and before I do
anything more speculation here right and
I have done a little bit of research on
this so I'll share my research that I've
found so far with you most of the
research is coming from gamers Nexus
they have a article up on this Steve
posted it linked to this articles down
in the description and if you're
interested in more of this because I
think this is going to be ongoing I
highly encourage you to check that out
because I'm going to be burying my face
in VR for the rest of the day to be
perfectly honest anyway so this order of
ten boxes arrived to lots of different
people they got they got one over at
gamers Nexus everyone go subscribe to
them and check out their stuffs they do
really good work over there there's also
some other people so Devendra heart
heart of our Devendra hardiwar from an
gadget apparently got one jack tio
apparently got one and they all direct
you to order of 10.com
which shows only this right now a
revelation waits to be deciphered not by
random chance but by a chosen order it's
very mysterious there's nothing to click
on on the page you know I haven't dug in
and looked at
Paige code or anything like that but um
as they've discovered over and gamer's
Nexus is that when you actually punch in
one of these codes it leads to a
specific page that page might have
additional information on it
it's all very cryptic and mysterious of
course this is an Arg or an alternate
reality game is how it's being I'm told
that's what it is anyway so um they have
a master code breaker working on it and
this is the page which is order of
10.com slash temporal shards which shows
the unlocked pieces so far and actually
if you're here you can click on them so
there's collusion which shows
tessellation wires or something like
that talking about tessellation this is
what's a lot of people are speculating
that this has something to do with
Nvidia I'm really not sure here's
another one
hyper love for the hypercube talking
about different inventors and people who
have done some things in the past whoops
wrong page or the other ones The Time
Machine by HG Wells okay with some some
interesting stuff in there and this is
already these have already been
deciphered next is a stepped reckoner
which is by Godfrey Lib needs Gottfried
Lydon Leibnitz most prolific man
apparently I am part of this order I am
being grouped in with all these other
people I don't even know what this mean
so anyway speculation right now is this
comes from probably either Nvidia I mean
video is kind of my number one guess and
the order of 10 right the 1080 series 10
or 10 hundred 10 10 whatever series it
could be those GPUs but it's maybe not
maybe not we got Intel as well then
remember to be coming out with a 10 core
processor right could be Intel or AMD
for that matter they have a Polaris 10
GPU I don't could be any of those things
but you know what I'm gonna do right now
is just actually do the thing and go to
the website that it tells me to go to
which is order of 10.com slash
uncertainty Maxim okay okay Wow I think
my shard is the missing shard did I get
to that point when I was talk about that
earlier is that all of these all these
things
go back to this this thing here and that
do to me ignoring this most of the day I
apparently have the last shard to unlock
so I gotta enter my code down here and
then I assume that the universe will
explode or perhaps it's like the Buddha
knee pushing the button and lost or
whatever you okay see what happens I
have successfully unlocked a shard in an
asset for the world
well Z you're welcome world I have
unlocked this asset for you and now it
is complete nothing said I thought that
like a door would open maybe there'd be
an animation or something anyway I can
click my shard
so here's your's this is probably like a
something that has to be solved or
whatever I'm probably going to have no
look at this we got some stars up here
this is a these are these are stars I
know these are stars this is a I don't
know what alright so Kepler aha so we
already have Fermi and Marian if Kepler
involved in this this is another thing
that's pointing us towards it being
something to do with Nvidia Kepler's
discoverer of elliptical orbits was a
crucial breakthrough in understanding
the universe in our place within it he
also gave great consideration to
constellations as he lived in age where
Ekstrom astronomy and astrology were one
I've got some codes here for F G H and I
and something about astronomy stars all
that important stuff so I'll leave this
to you guys everyone go and figure all
that out and discover what the hell all
this means and perhaps we can all profit
from it I did not know where this video
was going to go when I started it I
think this is as far as I can go for now
I hope you guys are at least intrigued I
certainly am I have no idea what's going
on but that's all thanks for watching
feel free to discuss down in the
comments section what the hell you think
is going on with any of this yes I I
have nothing further to add that is all
for this video thank you for watching I
hope you're at least intrigued curious I
hope we find out what the hell is going
on very soon and we'll see you all next
time on Paul's hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
