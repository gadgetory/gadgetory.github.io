I linked to my own stream oh my god Kyle
it's horrible
I'm sorry I'm sure I'm sure everyone
will figure it out eventually yeah
they're smart um hello everyone hello
and welcome hola it is it is time for
awesome hardware we're beginning right
now we're not beginning I'm sorry
we're continuing you give me give me
give me two seconds to paste this
totally have this all figured out suck
sorry don't you worry
awesome hard words what you're watching
right now it's a live show we talked
about technology computer parts mostly
we assume every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time and we split the show
in half the first half of this episode
which is number 164 already stream to
Kyle's channel which is bit width and
it's linked in the video description if
you missed it this is side B and then
after side B we're gonna do it after
party which I was supposed to link in
the video's description it's not it's
not there yet but I'm totally gonna do
that in the meantime though yeah at the
beginning of the show we usually do
stuff like warning you that occasionally
we use adult language from time to time
so please bear that in mind and damn
your ears if you are not wanting to hear
us curse and use words like dam dam dam
dam you other than that we also both
have stores and we highly encourage you
to help support our channels and get
yourself some nice merch by shopping at
our stores my store is Paul's Arbor net
we have shirts mugs pint glasses bottle
openers mouse pads mouse mats it's all
really good stuff so buy something won't
you do it and we will shout out your
name we're actually gonna do that in the
after party which will be linked in the
description in just a second yeah Kyle's
story Fiona did I say my story's URL is
you did Paul Sartre Burnett I didn't say
yeah okay Kyle store is also available
bit wit tech slash store for Kyle store
lots of merchandise very similar to mine
but with Kyle's logos on it instead of
mine yep
all real nice though so thank you guys
for supporting our show and how the heck
nice stupid thing that you've got this
man it's only your hundred and sixty
fourth show yourself a brains really
close I was on the verge of having it
proper alright nevermind no let's uh
let's get let's continue talking about
tech news right yeah technology news my
and you for the headline of my show
today which is about it tells high-end
desktop platform which which we've
talked about with some degree of
extensiveness on the show because it the
high-end desktop it's like this halo
product it's it's something that not
everyone can can can get to because it
tends to be more expensive so you have
to bear that in mind but if you can and
especially if you're actually using it
for something useful like video editing
or something something that requires
some CPU heavy lifting then it's
definitely potentially worth your while
to get into sure I've just realized that
I'm not this isn't logged into the right
account at all wow that's terrible
that's like Oh quick do a song and dance
which one of the beer go I brought him
out there right here oh no that's what
we forgot yeah I was wondering I thought
I felt there was something missing from
from your intro beer some ah we also
booze you must take the booze that
ablator yep we're never better okay yes
Kyle talk about beer from for just a
brief moment I realized what a simple
tonight I am the other day when I was I
was in Vegas with some friends we went
to this some bougie-ass brunch place
called templo is in the window and I was
like do you have a drink menu and the
waiter is like oh like drinks like what
kind of drinks like like cocktails like
he was super faces like oh like
cocktails and I was so inclined to just
say like a booze menu a Boozman I almost
literally said like a booze menu and I
rely looked around I was like I should
probably not say
that no that would have spoiled
everything definitely put me on the map
it was hashtag poor people so I said yes
a cocktail menu would be lovely sir I
see and I plan to never go back there
well done
so how's my boo story I've talked that's
the most entertaining the longest I
could be entertaining about talking
about say good booze story thank you
thank you moments from doing what I
wanted to do other boo story the booster
this one time one time Paul had to stall
for so long on a worldwide globally
streamed live stream that I had to make
up on the spot some bullshit story about
booze oh shit together why so lame and
embarrassing it was no no that actually
happened but I talk about this story now
okay yeah no thank you guys that
actually did happen alright no see what
daddy do dude did I do it good you know
that was good that's very good good it's
very good thank you
I'm Staller the vid if you refresh now
the after-party should be like the
description which doesn't even matter
because it hasn't even started yet so
this is true I realized that that was
less of a big deal also now the dogs are
freaking out for some reason why I
should close the door I'm gonna close
the door man go
hey eight more seconds of distractions
one two this thing - I'll just sing to
eight till it's over
hey beautiful everything's going
perfectly alright
Intel's high-end desktop platform is
potentially according to this article
from tech power up which I was noting as
I read it doesn't though here's the
source PC builder's club where is it PC
builder's club is where this is sourced
from yep where is PC builder's club
getting their source this is from
Germany anyway point being it's the
postulation here is that Intel is going
to actually fork their high-end desktop
platform well then it means there's
gonna be - this is gonna split from one
platform to two platform yes of course
right now Intel scientists but the
desktop platform is
$2.99 right let's guy like xcp use of
course according to this we the
successor to X 299 which can't of course
as you know be x3 99 because AMD already
was like dibs on x3 99 we're gonna name
we're gonna make that name sure Z 399 so
essentially what you have here is two
variants using two variants of a
high-end desktop platform one that's a
little bit more focused on high core
count CPUs and one that is a little bit
more focused on some backwards
compatibility as well as probably more
of a successor to what Scylla qex
currently is on X 299 so you'd have two
different sockets
you'd have LGA 20 66 which of course is
currently the socket for next 399 but it
would now have a new chipset so this
hasn't really been done before on the
high-end desktop platform usually they
they have a single chipset and they
stick it stick with it for like three
years so of course this brings up many
questions LGI 2066 would be z 399 of
course that's not an X anymore Z is more
like what they have on their mainstream
platform with like Z 270 and Z 370z 390
coming up soon mmm-hmm
X 599 would be LGA 36:47 aha 36:47
obviously is a much larger socket that's
the current socket that's used on the
high end Xeon server systems LJ 3647
would support 24 core 26 core and 28
core skylake x x CC processors which is
extended or extreme core count because
currently on skylake X they have high
core count and they have regular car
counter standard core count because
because it goes from four all the way up
to 18 and ran the current platform right
meanwhile this Z 399 new
successor chipset with LGA 2066 would
support up to 22 core CPUs so it's low
on jumping from 18 cores with the 79-80
XE right now to 20 and 22 right so you
can kind of see here if you're looking
at the article and of course all my
articles link the description if you
guys want to check them out
you can kind of see how they're they're
making the stratification of their high
end desktop platform and it almost
vaguely makes some sense to me in some
ways but you also have thrown in there
just the confusing aspect of the
freaking chipset names yeah which this
just makes more confusing that's gonna
mess everything up and so yeah so I'm so
I'm torn about this news assuming of
course that it is true this is obviously
this is this is early stuff and rumor
stuff so we're not a hundred percent
sure about it because that makes me
think that there's going to be different
features on each of these chipsets now
that we have to consider potentially
possibly the the article purports that X
$5.99 would essentially be a rehash of
their existing chipset that they have on
LGA 3647 which is what does it see it's
a see see chipped it's a see chip ready
to go see it's already kinda straight
here and blind I am blind see 506 C 506
no see 69 there it is C 629 Thank You
Kyle logic in the wrong
all right so X 5 to 999 would
essentially take their server chips see
629 add some client segment features and
subtract some enterprise segment one so
it wouldn't compete with their I had an
enterprise class stuff whereas the 399
would be an actual more like successor
to X 299 and what it is right now and
probably do some stuff like what Z 390
is doing I'm sorry c3 Knight yes the 390
is doing from Z 370 uh-huh adding stuff
like 802 11 AC Wi-Fi integration and USB
3.0
Z 399 is still gonna be more of like the
consumer based professional workstation
higher desktop a consumer of it but
consumer based consumer that's a post
like server side 4 X 5 9 9 X 5 anything
definitely sounds more like the Z on
type geared NX $5.99 or definitely
something to compete with AMD's at
bacons rise and thread Ripper and thread
Ripper to stuff or you know that they
have the 2990 WX which is 32 cores
mm-hmm on a consumer plate so Z 399
would be the competitor to thread it for
right the next $5.99 would be the
competitor to epic no X $5.99 would be
the competitor to the Red River I mean
they both be competitors to thread refer
in some respects okay but if you need
the core count and often things you need
core count for much more specialized
that yeah that's a problem with like
with with the 2990 WX on my AMD side Ram
is it's good some very specific things
yeah but it's actually not good at some
of the basic stuff like a you get much
better gaming performance sure with the
2950 X then you do with the 2990 WX
right now so yeah so there's there's
variables there with the that goes into
the high court count thing and
everything but ultimately its Intel
taking some of their existing hardware
that they already have working with them
on the server side and porting that down
to the consumer level which they've
definitely done many times before with
their high-end desktop platform but also
again creating this fork with two
different chipsets two different sockets
in the high-end desktop space still
high-end desktop was still that still
consumer focused so again I'm excited
about the potential for crazy powerful
computers in the consumer space and
stuff that's more reasonably priced in
the enterprise I like Intel answering
back to AMD and competing here
especially after everything that
happened with Red River I see computer
getting all mad oh no I was doing
and some websites farming it's it's
mining no just haven't came over so yeah
the the downsides to it of course are
just the stupid
there's the confusion confusion the
naming schemes yeah I feel like if you
could somehow separate everything AMD
and everything Intel and rename their
product stacks from the top down with
just something disparate on both sides
it would clarify stuff for especially
for anyone who's getting into PC
building for the first time just so much
yeah that would be nice but yeah
ultimately we'll have to wait and see
and I think there's still lots of people
who do still remember Intel's 28 core
demo with the with the chiller unit that
they did Computex mmm-hmm
specifically to try to combat the threat
for to launch stuff that they were about
to come out with and I think people are
still remembering that Intel did promise
the 28 core CPU by the end of this year
right a consumer high-end desktop 28
core CPU yeah and they're not gonna do
that I don't I don't think they can do
that on LGA 2066
so I feel like we're already in October
when the last we're in q4 we're
anticipating and Intel launched on the
main on the mainstream side pretty soon
I don't know it seems like there's a lot
this is like at the end of the year you
might have a lot of stuff going on maybe
I don't think it's all gonna be fate I
think into the end of the year the one
if it's gonna overflow into 2019 yeah so
we'll wait and see and we'll talk about
it when it happens so yeah hopefully
that brings you guys up to speed a
little bit with what's coming up on the
Intel side let's talk about tariffs and
gaming under the prices for computer
components here in the United States
game of gamers Nexus Steve our friends
over there at GN did some actual
journalistic work and contacted
technique he was our journalist Paul
everyone knows that well they are when
they also have a website where the X
written content as well okay so tariffs
is a situation here in the United States
where the government's decided to apply
tariffs to a bunch of different
countries who ostensibly because they
say we have trade deficits with them I
take issue with that but point being
stuff coming from China and specifically
with this phase three of the tariffs
that's going on right there that's phase
three part one started yesterday
October 1st 10% 10% tariffs on stuff
coming from China a specific list and
it's going to increase 15% more taking
it up to 25% January 1st 2019 gamers
Nexus went and talked to quite a few
different industry contacts that they
have EVGA CEO Andrew Hahn they talked to
somebody at NZXT somebody at Silverstone
somebody alpha cool they also have some
other comments from people who spoke to
them off record basically every single
one of these companies said they're
going to be affected by these tariffs in
some way some of them said like
everything we have is going to be
affected by this or most of this stuff
some like alpha cool said we actually
have quite a few things that don't fall
within the categories that are listed
yeah but they are only one there's but
they're still affected with some of the
products that they sell the way the
tariffs work are when a company in the
United States purchases products from
China the company in the United States
pays the tariffs and that money goes to
the US government we're not have a
percent sure what that money is
specifically being used for you might
assume that running going to the US
government might hopefully be used for
something positive but you might also
think that that's no way in hell that's
gonna happen so great
Farfetch'd this point yeah the full list
of tariffs includes products such as
Paris flies motherboards video cards
complete system builds which I wasn't
sure was on the list prior to now but
apparently it is bridges such as SLI and
NV link bridges I guess SSDs mouse pads
mice keyboards keyboards and mice only
have bundled together
with but he's not on keyboards if sold
separately so if you buy an individual
keyboard if you bought a bunch of
keyboards it wouldn't subject to the
tariffs but you if you bought a bunch of
keyboard Massa combos like the bunch
companies like ku and master yourself
then yahoo it CPU coolers cases chairs
and more there's stuff that's not
affected by the tariffs a lot of this as
the results of companies or industries
that have enough leverage enough
lobbying power to specifically go in and
say hey we have a bunch of people are
gonna be pissed off if they have a bunch
of tariffs now on their new iPhones so
iPhones are exempt laptops also are
exempt don't we have a voice don't we
have a say we have a say you can vote
well in just over a month you could vote
at the beginning of November I've been
encouraging people to register to vote
but you're saying iPhone fanboys don't
have to vote they can just say like
we're just gonna get really angry if you
everyone should vote no I know that
everyone should vote and undeniable but
but Apple Apple people don't have to
vote because so wait is that really can
you explain why like iPhones aren't
being tariffed but computer cases are
because as exceptions are made in
certain circumstances when enough noise
is made that people are like alright we
won't pull making exceptions for that
there's a bunch of exceptions to the
tariffs that or you have stuff like
subsidies being applied to like to
farmers and stuff because there was much
a choice soybeans women and so cuz it's
cuz soy was one of the things that was
on the tear was one of the things that
the tariffs were applied to nice but the
point being here is that PC parts are
probably going to be getting more
expensive how much more expensive they
get is still slightly up in the in the
air but you can expect ten to twenty
five percent more expensive did you
mention CPUs or GPUs on that list I
didn't catch those I cannot take video
video cards yes it doesn't
it says CPU coolers it doesn't say CPUs
sure so I think I was actually counting
keeping count of all the main parts of a
PC that you were listing
seven of the eight major parts of a PC
you just listed the only one being the
only not being CPUs so that's it's a
good chunk it's a good chunk of your
system
yeah so that sucks there's further
fallout from this there's a segment
about price increases possibly going to
be more than 25% because of other
factors taking effects a knock-on effect
so to speak where your companies lose
spending power and will charge consumers
to try to make up for it because of the
cutbacks they have to make in order to
carve out room to pay the tariffs so
that's an issue there there's also an
issue going on with shipping costs right
now because tons of companies are trying
to preempt the tariffs or at least get
ahead of them or at least stock up prior
to the holiday seasons that are coming
up so companies that have lots of
warehouse space in the United States are
actually in a better situation than
companies that do not because they're
able to like be like ship us everything
you have right now well it's while the
tariffs aren't taking effect or well
it's just 10% prior to it being a 25%
charge from that leader and stuff yeah
so we'll see what actually happens for
the holiday season and then I don't know
I mean the upshot of this right now I
think if people are asking like right so
what's what's the result is like if
you're thinking about building a
computer or buying a computer operating
it seems like you should probably do so
now before those rat leads - rather than
sooner rather than later so yeah Black
Friday deals might be shit because the
tariffs will be in full effect by then
potentially or potentially there's
enough companies will have stockpiled
product because a lot of truth yeah for
the Black Friday time period you know
that there's already been ship but it
doesn't that stuff doesn't always arrive
like a week or two before a lot of that
stuff has already been backlog being
stocked up right now so it's hard to say
how much of a significant effect that
might have on this holiday season but
hopefully it's not too bad and then want
to see how things go next year
kinda crappy only know as the prices are
as low as they can be right now we can't
say for the future yes
next story though video cards dot-com
for this one and Intel's ninth gen Core
processors the 9000 series we've talked
about a lot of the rumors and potential
stuff coming up with that for quite a
few for last couple months it seems like
there's been ton of leaks this is an
Amazon listing now the price on the
Amazon listing is five hundred and
eighty two dollars and fifty cents for
the I $9.99 hundred K yes which seems
pretty high a lot of the rumors we were
looking at were thinking it was going to
be more in the 450 maybe a little bit
higher than that range four hundred
fifty to five hundred dollar range but
that aside this supposed listing from
Amazon which was grabbed by a Twitter
user called the mo mo mo underscore us
has a picture of this ninth gen Corinne
and packaging which seems to be a unique
photo that I don't think has been seen
elsewhere and supposedly there's a
couple angles at it but this is just a
picture of the webpage so we can't see
that maybe an answer to some of the
stuffs that AMD has done with their
packaging on the high end especially
especially with the Thunderbird yeah it
seems to be a dodecahedron whose article
is this how does I mean it's ten sided
dodecahedron is deca sounds like ten
dodeca I believe is 1212 you could use
it for D&amp;amp;D dodecahedron there I was at
2000 like ghost 12 I was ready to draw
love okay twelve flat faces so a 12 a 12
sided box that I don't know why white
why that design just because it looks
fancy hexahedron and it takes ahead to
12 cores
yeah that's right
been like an eight-sided 16 sided
whoever whoever from videocards wrote
this article said it should be a
hexahedron there you go yeah which would
be thanks he'd ruin me it made sense a
solid figure with six plain faces I
would have been there would have been
like that attention to detail it but
this is an eight-core processor yeah
it's absolutely asinine anyway
nonsensical I don't know how much people
care about packaging or the unboxing
experience or stuff like that accurate
some of the videos have gotten quite a
few views when it comes to unboxing and
I will say when you buy something like
super fancy that you've looked forward
to for a long time if there's kind of a
cool unboxing experience for it that's
kind of fun yeah and it's nice
especially when you compare it to some
of the stuff that intel has done with
their cpu packaging which is basically
like we made this cardboard insert for
it which is like the cheapest slashed
most sturdy cardboard configuration to
support a processor that you could
possibly have another than that it's
like a box and there's a paper inside
you know that's okay
it transports the processor to you just
fine you know I don't mind something
like this we'll see if this is actually
true and if it is and maybe we will do
unboxing videos of it when available I'm
like I have no idea if that's actually
gonna happen or not yeah look again
though cool oh and here's the juice to
do dude you probably saw the packaging
moe moe moe us originally posted the
image alright easy time speaking of
prices going up because of tariffs e
times this e times article says DRAM
prices are declining dear I'm price
declines have been accelerating we've
talked about Samsung and a couple of the
other song SK Hynix and some of their
plans to like restrict their production
to limit availability to keep price as
high as there is a glut of availability
on the market and possibly a fall-off in
demand
and this is the fault and demand due to
why people aren't buying me as many
smartphones I guess smartphones and
laptops but according to the article
dear am pricing is expected to decline
about 5% in q4 vs. q3 of 2018 amid
increasing bit supply and limited demand
growth ahead of the holiday season
according to trend force it's a market
research firm that's Rex chip pricing so
we could leave it at that but no I want
more I want more we're gonna go over to
PC part picker Oh God
what we're looking at prices right now
of course price trends well first we're
gonna look at some price trend graphs
which you can look at on PC part picker
just go to price trends up here in the
upper right so let's check out like a
good ddr4 kit ddr4 3200 that's for my 4
4 by 4 so 16 gig ddr4 kit which is gonna
track roughly about the same as to make
it maybe a little bit more expensive so
we can see a definite dip right here for
September or for the end of September
yeah that's that's noticeable right
there yep bear mine this is the average
price of all the kids so you're getting
not just the kits that are writing the
like
lowest line of price you're also getting
the the kits averaged in here that are
significantly more expensive so this
average price line is usually a bit
higher than what you can actually buy
them for but this is a $200 line kind of
right at the center here and you can see
it was quite a bit above that it's
dipped down to get pretty close to it
now but this seems like it goes up right
at the holiday season too which makes
sense right the holiday season I like
for in past years yeah yeah that's
possible which makes yeah what I'm gonna
do though is just do a quick search what
do we want here what do you want we want
I like the 30 key I like 3,200 let's
look for 2x8 that's a new standard
configuration for a nice memory setup
yeah
and great is that that's better I mean
that's all for now this is pretty good
169
oh no no Kyle 135 hey that's pretty good
that is pretty good for a 3,200 speak it
and it's ripped off 5 which is pretty
yeah that's that's a nice pre reliable
all right well that's definitely dropped
I feel like it was yeah I feel like it
was I was gonna say well it ramps up
fairly quickly here but if this if these
are some recent drops it might take a
while to kind of trickle trickle up yeah
up to the to the other kits and stuff
true alright so something to keep in
mind again
we're like when you talk about the price
of computer parts I'm always yeah it's
very fickle
I'm always somewhat hesitant because
advice we can give you know sometimes
when I pee right sometimes it might be
wrong but people are always asking that
question like should I buy now should I
wait right and if this dip is something
that's like dipping down with the memory
prices right before everything increases
from the tariffs yeah this might be just
this idea a little time to buy like
October 2018 that I don't know
so anyway well we'll keep an eye on it
though welcome back to it that's all for
my news segment let's quickly lovely
talk about our sponsor for today okay
let's do every day go to sheba Oshawott
sponsor we already unboxed there yes
there OCZ are c100 this is their cute
little m to drive but we have a couple
others here we're gonna unbox that again
okay we're saving these for future weeks
toshiba has sponsored awesome hardware
for the month of october so we greatly
thank them thank you assume it makes a
ton of stuff but the stuff that we're
specifically talking about is their SSDs
yes which use BICS NAND flash memory
their own in-house memory yet so they so
they they make this NAND flash and they
can make it to be both fast and
affordable which is why the products
based on it are often very reasonably
priced and also still have a very quite
good performance
the products are showing off here is the
OCZ TR 200 which is a nice 2.5 inch SSD
available in a variety capacities and
this is again often very reasonably
priced so check that out online we also
have the XS 700 which is an external SSD
so it's like a little 2.5 inch form
factor but it's got USB type-c as well
as USB 3.1 gen2 connectivity and then we
also have this little drive that Kyle
was wearing on his nose which is super
tiny so it's a perfect example of just
how portable and compacted yes this is
the RSC 100 and it's available in a
couple different sizes - I said I wasn't
gonna unbox this I can about box it
right now so is that a larger capacity
as well because it's longer
that's 480 oh it's not longer though oh
it's not yeah Wow impressive so they're
both still 22 40s so 22 42 um when you
talk when you're talking a little MDOT -
SSDs and the form factor the size 22 is
the 22 millimeters wide 42 is 42
millimeters long usually most SSDs we
work with are 20 to 80 80 millimeters
long this one is just super super teeny
tiny like that 240 480 you said yeah 480
gigs and that little guy right there
yeah so compare that to something like
solid that's a 20 to 80 which is
basically like almost almost twice as
long right there
hell yeah so cool so a nice solution for
small form-factor systems hundred why
I'm about to Drai's weren't like more
drives went this size because it seems
like a lot of the PCB is not utilized on
a lot of this this extra section also
has a unique kind of cool thing because
you notice there's only one chip on here
yeah right that's like the entire thing
is on this chip it has a controller and
and the BICS and and on the single chip
yeah um so that's that's why table I
feel like honestly there's extra space
on this PCB right here going out to the
end
Terrebonne here easily yeah that's
that's cool sonar c100 from Toshiba can
find links in the description later
tonight after I add them I mines already
there you already did that I did all
right
go to Kyle's sly defender the first half
and there's links in the description
word I'll add that to mine to buy all of
them okay thanks to achievement thank
you Toshiba for sponsoring us everywhere
let's move on to games report games
report talk about some video games oh
yeah we haven't done games report in a
while I know I was happy to see that
you'd started the segment today well
there was some gaming news I felt like
people should know yar so let's start
out we are some Red Dead Redemption
Redemption - I should say I played the
first one I beat it and it was glorious
and I really really really really really
really hope it comes to PC so Red Dead
Redemption we will get to that Red Dead
Redemption by Rockstar Games it's a
Western open open worlds GTA 5 in the
Wild West GTA 5 in the Wild West takes
very popular amongst the people who have
played it for quite a wide variety of
reasons so good I mean GTA generally
does a good job with all the games and
it's coming very soon to PlayStation 4
and Xbox one and according to this
article it's also gonna take up a
hundred gigs more than a hundred gigs of
space that really sucks to be a console
yeah so for consoles which are
definitely more limited on space that's
a definite issue that they might run
into and and also if you have like a
limited limited bandwidth with your
internet connection or if you have
bandwidth cap 105 gigs of hard drive
space is the total amount it has to
install at least at launch that's cool
it's actually number 2 on the list of
the 15 biggest ps4 games and it's not
yeah it's very analyst it would be file
size wise hundred and five gigs not
biggest like most influential or like
successful but like just size wise right
I know maybe you're number one
on this list oh wow above battlefield 4
at surprised it's it's the it's the
latest open-world triple-a title so I'm
not terribly surprised honestly oh I
thought it was second cuz it says Red
Dead Redemption to the biggest games
okay yeah sorry the dogs are working out
in the other room though they have to
release it for PC oh now so that's
obviously the question and there's no
recent news on that but I did also link
an article from back in July about red
eared red dead redemption on the PC and
the answer is that there's not an answer
right now true to form Rockstar is being
being kind of cagey about confirming
that it's gonna come out on the PC
there's it's like reasonable to assume
that it will come out yeah but they're
probably not going to according to this
article they probably will not even
touch upon a PC release date before the
game arrives on consoles which is coming
in on October 26 by the way tonight did
I say that October 26 right there's a
launch date for the consoles so there
you go true this article on PC gamer
goes into a few their suspicions based
on for instance a LinkedIn ad that was
hiring people specifically to work on
the PC version of Red Dead Redemption
linked an ad for from Rockstar
there's also an anonymous rock star
employees LinkedIn profile I'm sorry
that's that comes from a profile before
was changed yeah but that's that's
pretty much it they did list how long it
usually takes rockstar games to come to
pc GTA 4 took seven months mm-hmm LA
noire took six months macpaint max payne
3 only two weeks but it was historically
considered a PC series so that kind of
makes more sense
GTA 5 17 months yeah Wow
two and a half frickin years yeah
between the I'm sorry one and a half
years they're almost one and a half
years yeah that was a long wait but I
mean it's still going strong considering
that it was announced alongside of 2014
version of the consoles at e3 yeah so we
have to cross our fingers that it's
gonna come to the PC do the first one to
make it
oh wait luster our camera oh geez hold
on Frozone don't worry guys oh boy exit
can I go to the bathroom quick of course
of course you can now he's gonna take a
leak watch out for the dogs they're
moving on though the oculus quest is
what we're talking about next oculus
quest is the next oculus VR headset
which is also going to come with not
just the VR headset there's a video here
which I'm going to kind of play I don't
know I don't know how much you guys have
it because it's it's like leave the
video isn't of the oculus quest it's of
a bunch of people getting excited about
old computer or old advances in gaming
technology so it's I it's a hype video
it doesn't it doesn't do anything to
tell you more about the oculus quest so
so let's do that
oculus quest is gonna cost 400 bucks and
it is Wireless it's basically standalone
so as you can maybe see from this dude
who's wearing it in this environments
which has been theoretically what he is
seeing here is much more fancy than what
we are seeing you can wear it wirelessly
and you can move around and that's
according to the article writer is a big
old advance over stuff like the oculus
rift there's a couple specs on it that
are listed watch further down here newer
higher around a higher end Oh display it
is LED this time 1600 by 1440 pixels per
eye only running at 72 hurts though
whereas the rift runs at 90 Hertz so we
can potentially see something like an
upgrade to the rift in the future that
is tethered to a PC but this will be
standalone and it's
probably gonna be something that's a lot
more accessible for people who now the
camera froze again what's going on with
it
no sorry about that guys
refreshed any person now yep so unusual
oculus quest is supposed to arrive in
spring of 2019 and I imagine for a price
of $400 for a standalone headset it's
running Android rigs and according to
the writer of the article on PC Gamer
which is west finland
he played several games he couldn't
distinguish a difference between the
performance of this and the oculus rift
other than of course those specific spec
differences that I mentioned it's
running a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835
processor but he tried like superhot and
he said superhot was basically the same
exact experience that was on the rift so
so so that's kind of cool and he's also
said the experience of playing super hot
where you have to like dodge bullets and
everything like as you move around was a
lot better since you weren't tethered to
any wires or anything I reckon about
Wireless here where else yes the oculus
quest is a standalone VR headset coming
in spring 19 for hundred dollars that's
Wireless yes got it Wireless and
standalone oh there's something you
might stand alone yeah so it's not you
don't need a PC it runs
oh oh does that even connect too well
damn that lowers the barrier to entry is
shit done it does what I'd be kind of
curious also to see for something like
this would be like the ability to
connect it to a PC like it like
something yeah something you can select
in bidi a shield the way it can do in
home streaming from a PC right so you
could be like you could use a standalone
to play games or you know you can have
the
you know a baller enough Wi-Fi
connection or something sure then you
could also connect to a PC to play games
that way that'd be cool
be interest let's move on though sorry
the dog is freaking out my wife just got
its good price too oh yeah Harry Potter
Harry Potter are you a fan of Harry
Potter cat I like Harry Potter
I'm not like a Harry Potter nerd I
wouldn't consider myself a Harry Potter
I don't know like all the lore but I
enjoyed the movies and I enjoy the book
you know the stuff okay but I'm not like
a Harry Potter geek
are you excited okay supposedly Harry
Potter footage like oh it's already
taken down Wow Warners really you can't
even see it anymore like I don't get I
like I don't get about Harry Potter I'm
not Harry Park each I don't get like
giddy about like leaks like this yeah
but like whatever new IP or whatever I'm
sorry whatever content peace that comes
out around it I'll probably check it out
well maybe this is a good thing then
that we can't replay the video if Warner
Brothers is taking bad videos doesn't
take down our streams then they might
take down issue a take down notice for
my stream the game might be called Harry
Potter magic awakens it's an RPG if I
kind of wanted to show you some of the
footage it was like it's like video of a
screen so it doesn't look that clean but
it also has kind of that sort of shady
look that makes you think like oh maybe
that's actually legitimate and I mean
the content on screen is pretty cool so
there was a little bit of the character
creation feature where you can kind of
create your character as a student at
Hogwarts sure I believe the time that
they say it was set is earlier there's
an analysis of the entire video in here
you're a newly arrived fifth year
student at Hogwarts that demonstrates a
latent gift for magic with unique
ability to track and identify remnants
of potent ancient power upon arrival
strange events but begin to materialize
in the Forbidden Forest and trouble
begins to bring within the castle walls
together with Professor Eleazar fig you
embark on a journey through both
familiar and never-before-seen locations
I'm fascinated so it's kind of cool to
see I mean if you watch the movies
the sum of the parts from the movies
like hard work
Hogwarts castle and stuff but anyway for
anyone who's really into Harry Potter I
imagine this will be a game that you
would be pretty stoked on your boyfriend
Harry Potter
yes yeah yeah I mean for any any any of
my interest in it is definitely stuff of
hers yeah yeah it's do you think this is
a game she would be checking out
potentially yeah maybe I don't know not
to see I mean I would think any any
diehard and of this franchise would be
who's also into gaming yes don't yeah
and also I mean it's Harry Potter is one
of those sort of it's got its own
universe yeah things so you know they're
always expanding on it there's a there's
a new fantastic beasts movie coming out
and I haven't really watched many of
those they're based in the US but that's
the theory is that they're going to
release the game along with the launch
of that movie um you know this sort of a
cross-promotional thing I say which
should make some sense is that because
they're from the same producers or
something or that's all on the same
visit a Wizarding World of Harry Potter
oh that's okay yeah that's the same
universe time yeah fantastic beasts is
also a part of Gajapati universe but I
believe it's set in America okay that's
honestly all I know about it I have a
three-pointer with West British accents
yeah but it's still go yeah uh right
look again sweet overwatch overwatch I
think overwatch they're making a Lego
line of Lego overwatch heroes
okay there's tracer he's like oh what's
pretty good she's missing the guns they
got her hair yeah you're right she
should have guns that make more sense or
at least should watch we should watch
this video okay so they're releasing
overwatch themed LEGO sets and a
Halloween event
what's the Halloween event we're not we
haven't gotten to that yet
Oh
well I mean wow it's amazing how more
legal this comes she moves around that
make sure that wasn't a hairy fire every
time yep that was Tracy Lego Blizzard
attaint Entertainment announced earlier
this year heroes of ever watch would
beginning their very own sets overwatch
Twitter account previously had a very
short first glimpse in the form of a
character selection screen video hinted
at the possibility of Leo Genji McCree
mercy soldier 76 Reaper or maybe
zenyatta or Reinhardt and Widowmaker at
the very least no further information on
which heroes will be featured or which
locations will beginning their own sets
Lego line will join the nerf weapon line
which features divas light gun and
Reapers Hellfire shotgun as part of
overwatch is for with forays into the 20
market and it makes sense that they
probably get overwatch Legos they
probably you know do the numbers and say
hey we have a certain age group or a
demographic that plays this video game
that overlaps with the same age group
that plays with Legos so I thought
everyone played with Legos oh that was a
normal thing
I still do every game it's also October
October is the month that Halloween
falls in so here's another article from
variety what's a variety or double
feature see yes yes
overwatch has a seasonal Halloween
events they've only just teased it they
said there's a rumor among explorers
about a monolithic lair home to
terrifying Horrors heroes how will you
prepare and there's a video which is
kind of stupid I mean it's not stupid is
a seven second video so it's like it's a
it's very much at ease this is number
128 overweight I want to play stupid
yeah this is from the overwatch Twitter
account so there it is so maybe there's
gonna be a special Halloween map like
that's literally
the entire video what yeah maybe you're
playing on that castle yeah
October night those when it starts in
the birthday a week from now oh yeah
your birthday and yeah so that's kind of
cool also along with that they have more
stuffs they're trying to sell you of
course
overwatch Halloween costumes oh those
are gonna go millions then these are
like official officially licensed
overwatch Halloween costumes Wow again G
soldier Tracy oh it got adult costumes
just slap in the face all that on there
I should get it Genji muscle adult cuffs
gonna be funny if you bought one of
those leave you bought that costuming
you want to cosplay contest people who
like custom-made they're their own Ginji
outfits I mean if you're again humane
then obviously you should should embrace
that yeah yeah yeah there we go
overwatch Halloween stuff sweet and that
pretty much wraps it up for my half of
the show beautiful normally this is
where we would do the after-party we are
gonna do the after-party now yeah so
here's the deal guys
we've sort of slightly been changing up
the format of our show intending to make
it shorter a little bit and a little bit
more succinct we didn't quite do that
today but that's fine and we've been
doing we've been doing our after-party
on Twitch but we had a few people who
are like I don't use twitch or whatever
or I like watching everything on YouTube
so we've decided to still do the after
party on Twitch but we're also going to
do the after party on YouTube as well
just the after party video on YouTube
will probably end up being unlisted in
the future so in the video description
is a link to the after party if you want
to watch it on YouTube or if you want to
watch on Twitch go to twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware hardware where we have
been streaming this entire episode
hundred and sixty-four yep if you don't
deal with any of the jumping around
between stuff and we continue over there
momentarily so we're giving you the best
of both worlds and you have no more
reason to complain exactly thank you
guys for watching this video the thumbs
up button and a big thank you to whoever
watch every lovely person does
timestamps for me I will I'll pin your
I'll pin your comments and all that good
stuff in you exact type inyou Loki also
