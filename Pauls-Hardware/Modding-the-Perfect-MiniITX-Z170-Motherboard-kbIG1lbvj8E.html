welcome to this sort of quick impromptu
in-between video about my wife's build
hot box which I completed actually a
couple months ago it's up and running
she's been using it to play well mostly
overwatch but also some doom and it's
pretty much good to go although if you
guys watched my previous video series on
that you might be aware that I just
wasn't necessarily under percent happy
with how it turned out
so I have been previewing other parts to
basically integrate into that system I
have collected pretty much everything I
need to move on with the build through a
phase 2 of this project for that I've
decided to first upgrade the CPU since I
am water cooling the system and it's
pretty high-end water-cooled system the
6600 K you know it's a nice unlocked
overclockable CPU but the 6700 K is kind
of the this is what I would get if I was
building a new water-cooled system on
this platform and so that's what I'm
going to be dropping in their new
motherboard of course that's what this
video is going to be mostly about is
modifying this motherboard to make it
match aesthetically with the rest of the
parts of the build since finding a mini
ITX motherboard on z170 that has a good
color scheme is actually pretty
difficult a bit of a challenge anyway
but other than the CPU and the
motherboard I'm going to be doing some
painting today so some of that there
I've got a replacement 8 pin a CPU power
connector from unsourced customs Joe we
actually sent this over to me free of
charge a big thanks to Joey he does a
really good job over there and I needed
an 8 pin because previous motherboard
only required a 4 pin and we want
overclock so more power there's a big
pile of fittings over here this is from
the supplementary stuff that ek has sent
over I mainly needed some additional
fittings so I got some rotary fittings
here these are really nice because you
can twist them to be 90 degree or sort
of in between 90 and 45 these are great
for just getting stuff lined up properly
or doing a little offset or something
like that I have a pass-through right
here so this is what I'm going to
possibly punch a hole through the bottom
of the case to do just a drain at the
bottom so I might use this for that or
else of a fill port right here which is
effectively the same thing but you know
it's a little bit larger need a little
bit cleaner I'll probably test both of
those and see which one works better and
use which
everyone seems to work better finally
get some like 90 degree fittings and
that kind of thing we got to make sure
that I have everything needed so that's
why I had this whole pile because if I
was missing something I didn't want have
to wait for it to ship all the way from
ek over in Europe so all right for
coolants we do have some upgrade or some
change this is the pastel orange
concentrate coolant from Mayhem's I
tried a couple different clones from
bits power and Mayhem's before but it
was the not opaque the the clear types
of cool it's at least coolant dye
this is pastel so it's much more dense
and you can't see through it J has had
weird random issues with this stuff so
we'll see how it works for me but I also
got two of them because it's overkill on
too much
lastly more tubing 12 millimeter inner
diameter 16 millimeter outer diameter
this is what I was kind of running out
of when I was doing the original build
and I was getting my bends down and I
found this type of tubing to be a bit
more challenging I got a lot of this
though this time so I can redo any
builds that I need to redo and make sure
I have plenty left over so I don't start
to get worried about running out like I
did with the original build back to the
subject of today's video though and I'm
going to be doing a quick unboxing of
this while I talk this is the z170 I
pearl gaming motherboard made by Asus
Zealand 70 board and the reason I'm
swapping to this motherboard is for
overclocking purposes because the
gigabytes the gigabyte z170 n Wi-Fi was
was able to overclock but basically I
was only able to get about four point
actually at four point six gigahertz
stable for a little bit and then that
ended up having some issues so I decided
to upgrade the motherboard to something
that could possibly do a little bit
better with overclocking if you look at
z170 motherboards that are available
right now though and you sort them by
mini ITX options and you look at what's
out there
you'll find that the one I chose from
gigabyte originally the zealand 70 and
Wi-Fi is pretty much the only kind of
mostly pretty much color neutral board
that's out there this one is I think
kind of a close second and this one does
have some benefits such as better power
delivery so you got a pin connector
there instead of a four pin you also
have some decent size heat sinks here
over the power delivery elements for the
CPU so that's going to hopefully help us
maintain a better overclock I knew
already than my 6600 K that I used
in hotbox hood hits as 4.7 gigahertz I
did that on a Maximus 8 formula
motherboard but on the z170 and Wi-Fi it
was really topping out it sits 4.6
originally and then we had a bit of
instability there so I've actually
rolled it back to 4.5 this motherboard I
think should be able to hold well I'm
actually not sure what we're going to be
able to get since I have a new 6700 K
here a little squished in the box but
we'll see how that overclocks
and hopefully we'll do a little bit
better so back to the dilemma for anyone
who's trying to build a mini ITX system
is really looking for a color
coordinating board if you don't want
black and red then your options are
really limited so this board fortunately
is pretty much all black with a little
bit of sort of gray square some silver
accents on some of the pieces that are
going on in there we only have three
maybe four elements of red we have the
pro gaming right here with the Asus logo
on it that's bitter red there and then
we have the heat sinks up top that have
some red accents over here and over here
we have one last a little bit which is
the cable here for the this is the
battery right yeah this is a battery
yeah that's a motherboard battery and I
might pull that off and just paint it or
something like that just to get rid of
all of the color on the board
other than that though it has the other
features that as looking for which is an
m dot 2 on the board right there on the
back which is I need that because that's
one of the main drives in the system and
then I also was hoping to get Wi-Fi and
this one does also have Wi-Fi in there
too so nice to have all the features and
in a color scheme that hopefully I can
modify it to be color neutral the way
I'm going to do that is by removing the
heat sinks to spray-paint them
essentially now there's two different
types of mounting methods for the heat
sinks here you might also notice this
lower one here just says these little
plastic prongs they pop through so I'm
gonna just just use some pliers to
squeeze those and pop those back out
they're kind of annoying to remove but
they can with a little bit with by being
careful and a little delicate you can
get those off and it's not too much of
an issue the other heat sinks on the
board fortunately are held on by these
screws right here so we got standard
Phillips head screws so those should
come off very easily and they do have a
bit of therm
pad underneath them that I can see along
here at the edge so I'm gonna need to be
careful to maintain that but I'm just
going to remove those and then we'll be
doing some spray painting now when it
comes to spray painting or modifying
something like this you have a few
options of course Plasti Dip has been
championed by a lot of people because it
is not conductive however Plasti Dip is
difficult to use anywhere that might get
extremely hot places it warm up it can
melt so I'm going to go and skip the
Plasti Dip option this is just some more
general purpose spray adhesive that's I
paint that's pretty severe why is that
they what I'm going to be using is a
self etching primer right here this is
heavy duty stuff it's made for auto
bodies steel and aluminum I'm using some
heavy protection when I actually use
this which includes I'm going to be
spray-painting it outside and I'm using
you know the air filter thing gas mask
on my face make sure I don't know hail
too much of this and this is going to
make sure that it is into the grooves
first of all which is very nice
and also I've used this prepaid before
set I know it has a nice flat black
finish and hopefully everything should
turn out nice and pretty one last thing
to point out before embarking on an
endeavor such as this is I just bought
this motherboard this wasn't provided by
Asus I bought this directly from Amazon
so the first thing I'm actually going to
do before I do any modifications make
sure the damn thing works so I'm going
to install my 40 or my 40 60 700 K and
some memory and just plug it in make
sure it's up and running and if that is
all good then I will move on to some
modification of my heat sinks
all right the tabletop build is done and
it looks like we have power so let me
just short a couple pins here if I can
figure out where the heck they are oh I
found them power button okay cool that's
good enough for me
they're definitely more tests we can do
and whatnot but usually if you get into
the BIOS it means most of the major
issues that you might discover out of
the box are not going to be issues so I
am confident enough to proceed with the
modifications to the heat sinks and the
avoiding of my warranty
I'm pretty sure I can just heat gun this
top layer off here and if I do that and
the underneath is still finish you know
come like the edges here I might just
leave it as is and just leave that off
if not I'll have to figure out a way to
color this or paint it this is the
adhesive on the chipset heatsink
which is pretty thick but I'm actually
just sort of pushing it with my thumb a
little bit at a time and it's coming off
Oh
okay it's next morning now and here's a
look at the chipset heatsink finished
cleaned I was actually considering like
spray painting over this or something
but I think I'm totally fine at the
finish so you know that's mostly clean
there are few scuff marks where as
gripping it with the pliers and whatnot
I could have been a little bit more
careful with that but it looks just fine
and with the little retention pieces in
place the rough spots alone the edges
really you can't see very much so I'll
be okay with that so happy with how that
turned out also of course the heat sinks
themselves which turned out pretty
nicely I didn't get these from all
angles because the black was blending in
pretty nicely I mainly needed to get the
top to get rid of that red accents and I
think I did it is one of them at least
other one is here these are all dry and
it turned out very nice great clean I
did have to tape off all these pads back
here to make sure none of those got
anything on them but now it's time to
reassemble
and there it is guys the finished
product for the mods at least the ones
that I did last night and kind of
finished off this morning primarily
removing this stupid pro gaming Asus
logo from the chipset that's so much
better without it why why even make this
thing and put this cost money to put
that on there and it's stupid anyway
also of course the painting of these two
heat sinks also came out very nice and
finally just a very slight modification
with some Plasti Dip on the little
battery cable right there to get that
all black as well so everything is just
matching super nicely now this is going
to be very clean and it will blend in
with my orange and black and gray build
that's of course going to be redoing for
my wife hot box version 2 I'm pretty
excited so anyway guys I know it's going
to be probably another week and a half
until I can move on to the next step of
this project but it is nice to know that
with a bit of modification you can get a
z170 board that is looks pretty cool can
overclock has all the good features that
you'd want and it also well it's got a
voided warranty I guess that's the
downside to it the only other thing I
need to double check is to make sure I
can disable these LEDs down here pretty
sure I should be able to do that but I'm
not positive so wish me luck on that one
anyway guys thanks for watching this
video hit that thumbs up button once
again let me know if you enjoyed it and
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
