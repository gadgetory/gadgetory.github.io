this video I don't do personal updates
like this all that often but I guess
I'll just start out with kind of the
headline news I am a father now baby's
healthy mommy's healthy so everything's
great there I wanted to talk a little
bit about my experience over the past
couple weeks though because for one if I
don't make a video about this I'm not
gonna make a video about anything and
for two a lot has gone on I actually had
to write down a couple pages of notes
just to remind myself everything that's
happened over the past couple weeks and
it's not all about the babies so I'm
just gonna talk about it let you guys
know what went on yes I'll be sharing a
little bit of the baby towards the end
but I am gonna try to keep up with my
promise to not turn my channel into a
channel about our new baby she will be
popping up from time to time but I am
gonna be still focusing on text so don't
worry about that so my story begins in
the last week of April 2019 and I told
you guys that my baby was due in late
April but the actual due date was April
25th on the 25th the baby hadn't come
yet so we were still just trying to go
about business as usual and that morning
Joe came over he is my editor he also
has been helping me film stuff and in
the morning we were getting ready to go
and we looked at hero my large dog who's
down here snoring and he wasn't right
Joe noticed at first I noticed he seemed
a little off and then just over the
course of maybe five or ten minutes he
suddenly couldn't stand up anymore
he was wobbling to the side we tried to
let him into the backyard and he could
just tell something was very much wrong
and it escalated pretty quickly from the
point where I was like all right am I
gonna have to have my wife take him into
the vet to like oh we need to take him
into the vet right now so we cancel
treating for that day we took an
emergency trip down to our vet which is
located in Fullerton and they did an
initial diagnosis basically they were
worried that he might have had a stroke
there were possible other complications
that could have happened
so they referred us to a specialist in
Orange County called the Orange County
Veterinary Specialists they're actually
located in Tustin we drove down there
and there they were able to do a bit
more of a diagnosis and eventually they
determined that he had what is known as
vestibular disease and if you're not
familiar with that it is actually
somewhat common in older dogs and I've
heard sometimes even more common in
larger dogs but basically it just
happens it's a sudden onset of vertigo
so the dog can't maintain balance and
they fall over and it's very noticeable
in the eyes the eyes will constantly
track back and forth
over and over again like the dog can't
stay focused on a single point of
reference so I tweeted out that day to
ask for some support for people I
tweeted again as we were on the way back
from our vet because at that point we
knew he had vestibular disease or we
were pretty sure of it
nystagmus is the condition for the eyes
and you can kind of see it here in this
video that I tweeted out sort of the eye
shifting back and forth so just for
those of you who might have a dog an
older dog or a larger dog in particular
keeping that for this type of behavior
because it just happens they don't
really know exactly why it can sometimes
be caused by an ear infection so what
they sent us home from the vet with that
day was some antibiotics to counter
potentially an ear infection also same
painkillers and they basically told us
it's just gonna take a week to ten days
plus for it to sort of slowly wear off
often dogs can recover from this fully
or recover from it mostly they might
still have a little bit of a head tilt
that comes out of it and sometimes they
can still have a little bit of bad
balance after the fact fortunately at
this point Hiro is doing much much much
better he still does have that little
bit of its head tilts and he doesn't
always walk in a straight line but he's
doing way better and he's very much back
to his old self so that was good but
that is definitely not the end of the
story as I already mentioned that was my
wife's due date the day our baby was
supposed to be born if our baby was on
time for things which probably isn't
gonna be the case for her lifetime
that's probably hereditary but the point
is we were kind of on edge because we
knew that the baby could come at any
minute so for the next 4 5 days or so we
were just kind of going about business
as usual as much as we could waiting for
a baby to come did some doctors
appointments eventually they decided to
schedule my wife to be induced to have
labor induced on May 1st now quick note
here about our dogs we have two of them
Noorie is a cardigan Welsh Corgi she's a
smaller dog she's very well behaved and
everyone loves her Hiro is a larger dog
and he's very lovable but he's also what
is known as a bully breeds so people are
sometimes a little bit more intimidated
by him and there's certain rules at
certain places about boarding dogs like
pit bulls
he's a pitbull Mastiff mix in case you
were wondering he is also a pound puppy
and ever since we got him he has had
very very bad separation anxiety if I'm
not around or if my wife's not around he
gets really nervous we can generally
leave him here with nori and the two of
them together are okay chillin for a
while
and we have a camera so we can keep an
eye on them and everything but just over
the past six months or so when we have
boarded here oh he's gotten more and
more nervous and more and more not happy
with being in a kennel and so the place
where we typically board him
we can't bore him anymore so we had
arranged for Joe to come over and house
it and save us there so that my wife and
I could go into the hospital for the
delivery of our baby baby and we would
be confident knowing that our dogs are
here and had someone to keep an eye on
them and even more so now that Hiro had
just gone through this vestibular
disease thing which she was still
recovering from we wanted to make sure
somebody had kept an eye on him
so next fast forward to Tuesday April
30th and this was a night that we had
awesome Hardware Kyle came over here we
broadcast the live show from right here
where we usually do and then Kyle went
home and later that night I had let Hiro
and nori into the back yard to do their
business and a few minutes later I
noticed Hiro coughing or hacking he was
over on the side of our yard and again
it was just a situation where at first I
was like okay do you have something
caught in your throat
he kept hacking over and over again he
started to get really like full body
like he's that he was trying to clear
something out of his throat again
incredibly concerning and I was like all
right I have we need to take him in it
was late at night this time but
fortunately we actually have an
overnight emergency vet that's
relatively close to us here as well so
it took in there had to wait around for
a little bit of time basically they
found that he did have something caught
in the back of his throat it might have
been a fox tail or something from the
backyard I either as a result of that or
it was just caught because we brought
him in for that but he also had a bunch
of air in his belly which is known as
bloat in larger dogs and especially with
larger dogs if they get bloated their
stomach can actually flip upside down
it's a very common problem for big dogs
especially if they eat very quickly and
take a lot of air and if that happens
basically the dog dies unfortunately so
that was a big concern for us they kept
him at that facility overnights we woke
up first thing the next morning went and
took picked him up from there took him
to our vet in Fullerton again took him
down to the specialists in Tustin and
then they had to keep him there for a
day or two in order to monitor him
keeping him on some pain medications
they did some x-rays and they were
updating us on his status
so again reminder this was now six or
seven days after my wife's
initial due dates are
dog is in the vet done in tustin we need
to go to the kaiser permanente where
we're going to be delivering our baby
which is in Baldwin Park not exactly
very close to each other and we have a
situation where we have to get our dogs
back home together at some point so we
started doing a bunch of phone tag and
coordinating with my parents and with
Joe Joe also was scheduled to see
Avengers end game which we were trying
to be sensitive to
he eventually very graciously postponed
his Avengers end game viewing dates so
that was very nice of him again
Joe was super clutch this entire past
week I must say but after we had finally
gotten all that coordinated for my
parents to pick the dogs up and go and
meet Joe at our house and so we were
gonna go into the hospital we got a call
from the hospital that's they were very
full in the labor and delivery area and
asked if we could push the induction
back one more day which was a little
frustrating because we were ready to go
but also helpful because it meant that
the following day on May 2nd my wife and
I were able to go pick up Hiro bring him
home Joe came over and we did a
transition there Joe then stayed at our
house we went to the hospital for our
scheduled induction on the evening of
May 2nd and then we sort of switched
from the prior week of oh no what the
heck is happening with our dog - the
following week which was we're having a
baby now which was very exciting but
also of course a little scary to sum up
the next couple days though basically it
was a labor and delivery situation I'm
not gonna go into too many details there
but the very very good news is that my
daughter Hana was born on May 4th at
1:52 a.m. she weighed 8 pounds and 1
ounce and she is super happy and healthy
and she poops she poops and cries a lot
but but we we love her we love her so
much yes we are prepared for essentially
a lifetime of made the fourth jokes
since she was now born on Star Wars day
we didn't name her Leia or array or
anything like that though so um actually
she's she's kind of slightly named after
Deva from over watching I'm don't want
to get into that but the next few days
was not necessarily easy either I don't
know how many of you out there have kids
or expecting to have kids or anything
like that but it's a it's a new and kind
of crazy experience and if I can impress
one thing upon you watching this video
it's that once the baby is born
there's
sort of an aftermath time there which
can which can go by relatively easily
and quickly but it can also be very hard
as well so we had two complications our
baby had jaundice and that's very common
you can use photo therapy it actually
gave us this led fiber-optic thing to
set her up with in her crib when she was
sleeping at night to provide more blue
light on her skin because that is one of
the ways that you deal with jaundice
levels fortunately our Billie her
bilirubin levels is what happened the
actual name of the thing that
accumulates in the blood fortunately her
jaundice was never acute enough that she
had to go to the newborn intensive care
unit or anything like that so it was
just something we needed to monitor and
take care of as for my wife Diana she
also had some complications I'm not
going to go into the details of those
just suffice it to say that they were
uncomfortable and frustrating but not
life-threatening so it was just a
situation where we were really ready to
go home with our baby after such a long
and stressful week and we just had to
stay at the hospital for like
two-and-a-half extra days and wait and
sort of wait and wait and and and that
got really frustrating but we finally
finally were able to go home on the
evening of May 6th and then the very
next morning we had to go right back to
the hospital for more checkups and
everything but point being we are
incredibly happy because my wife is
happy and healthy and recovering as best
you can baby is doing super great I
can't I can't tell you guys how cute I
think she is I hope you agree if you
don't you're stupid and wrong so since
May 6 we have just been here at home
doing our best to maintain keep things
under control we've had a bunch of help
from friends and family which has been
super awesome and yeah just you got a
you got to clean the baby you got to
feed the baby and a burp the baby the
baby is kind of in control at this point
but we're okay with it we're gonna get
through it and I just wanted to share
this little slice of our life with you
guys in case you were wondering what's
going on with Paul where I have been
over the past couple weeks maybe a
little bit more detail about some of the
stuff I've been tweeting there's another
picture I tweeted of Hiro when we took
him to the park after he was recovering
from his vestibular disease where he's
just super happy so that's that's the
other really great thing is Hiro
recovering while doing really well and
he's still he's still kicking so we're
looking forward to spending more time
with him thank you guys so much for
watching this video the
I don't know what kind of questions you
might have but feel free to leave them
in the comments section below hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it I
should be back to a relatively normal
schedule within the next couple weeks
but please bear with me I would probably
be a little bit more sporadic than usual
but I've already got a couple video
shots so so that's awesome again a huge
huge thank you to Joe
he's we could not have done this this
without him I can't I can't like as we
were being kept at the hospital and I
had to keep calling Joe or texting him
and be like hey so we don't know when we
can leave are you okay to stick around
longer and he was just he was just super
awesome to do that and stick around and
he did eventually get to see endgame and
what would you think Joe oh oh he's
alright he's okay
no it was really good Game of Thrones
that's what sucks now hey I'm getting
distracted thank you so much for
watching guys we'll see you in the next
