be doing a quick review of this my Onix
naos 8200 wired laser gaming mouse mouse
has actually been out for a little while
now but I wanted to cover it because the
nos has been one of my favorite mice
ever since I tried the nails 5000 back
in 2011 also while this mouse does have
a $90 MSRP you can currently find it for
far less than that at mass drop the drop
going on right now actually has it for
$55 plus shipping at the lowest unlocked
price I'll include the mass drop linked
in the description right down here it's
right next to the like button and if the
drop has ended by the time you watch
this video can always request for mass
drop to bring the drop back here's a
quick look at the box though I like that
my onyx keeps the packaging minimal it's
simple and eco-friendly and after
removing the mouse itself I can talk
about why I like it really for me with
this mouse it's all about the design and
ergonomics the annouce 8200 has a
contoured body with a wide stance and
resting areas for the thumb on the left
side and the ring and pinky fingers on
the right side that doesn't mean that
it's a right-handed Mouse if you're a
lefty you might be more interested than
the my onyx baby or which is
ambidextrous there's also a soft finish
on the outside of the mouse which feels
absolutely fantastic and I can say from
experience that it's fairly durable as
soft finishes go I can't promise that
you won't have worn some shiny spots on
it after maybe 2 or 3 years of use but
it's not gonna wear off in a month or
two either the contoured design is
probably my favorite aspect of this
Mouse as it just feels extremely
comfortable my hands are a bit larger
than average though so you want to
consider what grip you use I find it's
pretty workable for claw or fingertip
grips and especially for a palm grip
although lift-off can be cumbersome due
to the wire body so keep that in mind if
you game with a low dpi setting that
requires a lot of lift off my grip is
sort of between a palm and a claw grip
but it's firm reassuring it's calm yet
assertive perhaps a bit coarse at first
but subtle nimble gentle like a warm
summer breeze after a long winter s
respects the primary difference between
the now 8200 and the other variants like
the NOS 7000
the Avago a DNS 9800 laser sensor that
you get here up to 8200 dpi sensitivity
high DPI or CPI is one of the benefits
of a laser sensor after all and that
also features a one millisecond response
time you also get seven buttons all of
which are programmable with the my onyx
software left and right click forward
and back just above the thumb rest two
buttons to change your dpi settings just
below the scroll wheel and of course the
scroll wheel Center click the scroll
wheel itself is sturdy without being
difficult to turn and it has a very
grippy rubber finish that actually just
feels fantastic there are very large
PTFE pads on the bottom for easy gliding
of the mouse across your mouthing
surface and you can also see the
business end of the ad NS 9800 sensor
down here also internally there is a 72
Hertz 32-bit ARM processor and a hundred
and twenty eight kilobytes of memory so
you can save the profiles to the mouse
and have it remember them there's also
the 2 meter braided cable with a USB
plug that's plated in gold so that
you'll have something to use as a
rudimentary form of currency during the
inevitable upcoming zombie apocalypse
here's a look at the amount of software
it will do the things you expected -
including button programming changing
the polling rate click speed scroll
speed acceleration lift off distance
recording macros and saving them all -
up to 5 profiles also of course you can
adjust the amount Eevee LED lighting
here and you can individually choose
color for the my Onix logo on the palm
the DPI buttons the scroll wheel and the
lights that indicate your dpi settings
which are just in front of the forward
and back buttons
so in closing I think I can safely
recommend this Mouse to anyone out there
who's looking for a mouse of this type
especially with the mass drop pricing
and again this is bar none one of the
most comfortable mice I have ever used I
was on the fence at first about the lack
of a weight system which the original
announced 5000 had but not having it
does give the mouse kind of a lighter
weight a lighter feel which after
testing that was just fine with me
but that's all for this video thank you
guys so much for watching links are in
the description once again don't forget
to Like share and subscribe it because
I'll be back very soon with more tech
