is do you like really really fast
storage if you do you should like this
video okay it was a pretty poor attempt
but today's video is really all about
MDOT 2 also known as next-generation
form factor although that's getting to
be a little bit passe and what it can do
for you and your computer and just to
mix things up I'm going to combine this
MDOT to tutorial with a quick review of
a new drive from a data that is the a
data SP 900 and the m2 2280 version so
for new Intel platforms that launched in
2014 we're seeing a new type of form
factor connection between permanent
storage and your computer
now there's MDOT 2 which is what we're
going to be talking about today there's
also SATA Express those drives are
really hard to come by as of the making
of this video so I'm going to focus on
MDOT 2 will save SATA Express for a
different video now if you currently
have a drive connected to your computer
chances are it connects via serial ata
that's been a standard that's been in
place for some time and SATA is actually
pretty easy it's pretty straightforward
because both the connector and the
protocol for communicating between the
driver 2 computer both called SATA or
serial ata
the only confusion may be with serial
ata is that we went from revision 1 to
revision 2 to revision 3 basically get
us more bandwidth each time and we're
stuck right now with SATA revision 3
that gives us 6 gigabits per second of
bandwidth that's available for connected
drives to use to communicate with the
rest of the computer now to talk about
m2 we need to distinguish between two
important things
there's the connector or the physical
plug that connects a drive to the rest
of your computer and there's the
protocol which is a standard for the
digital communication between the drive
and the rest of your computer let's
start by talking a little bit about the
m2 connector itself it has a width first
off and there's different widths that
are supported 12 millimeters 16
millimeters 22 millimeters and 30
millimeters although right now the most
common one that I've seen is 22
millimeters then we also have different
lengths that can be supported as well
aside from the width you'll also notice
two notches on the edge connector these
are referred to as keys and the m2 spec
has a list of potential notch locations
that correspond to different types of
devices that can be connected e keyed m
dot 2 slots will fit new wireless cards
for example but fortunately SSDs will
primarily use the B and M keys at least
right now most of the SSDs I have seen
actually come with both B and M keys
available on the edge connector which
eases compatibility concerns since
they'll fit both B and M key m2 slots so
are a data SP 900 here is a 20 to 80 M
to drive which means it's 22 millimeters
wide and 80 millimeters long there are
also different lengths determined by the
m2 spec and the most common ones that
I've seen are 30 40 to 60 80 and 110 and
depending on your motherboard or
notebook you might have support for
different lengths installation of m dot
2 is actually really simple if you've
ever installed an Esso dim in a notebook
before it would be very familiar you
just pop it in in much the same way and
a single screw will secure the card in
place an top 2 can support devices using
two different protocols and here's where
some confusion comes into play you have
the SATA protocol on one hand that we've
been familiar with and using for some
time you also have the PCI Express
protocol a PCI Express has actually been
in use for some time for storage devices
and you can get devices such as this Oct
Revo drive that connect directly to the
PCI Express slot on your motherboard and
that allows you to use this for really
really fast storage and get around the
SATA bottleneck the difference here is
it hasn't been natively supported yet
native support means it will have better
compatibility and will also get to ditch
that nasty boot delay that happens when
an option ROM loads like it does with
the OCZ Revo drive now an M 2 SATA Drive
as opposed to PCI Express is gonna have
the same available bandwidth as a
standard SATA Drive that's 6 gigabits
per second for Gen 3 current
implementations of m dot 2 PCI Express
on the other hand are currently Gen 2 by
2 so PCI Express Gen 2 by 2 is the
connection and that gives you 10
gigabits per second of bandwidth so 40%
more than SATA and more available
bandwidth means that drives that are
faster are going to be able to perform
faster now the really cool thing about m
dot 2 PCI Express drives is that there's
a lot of room for future growth
so whereas right now we have Gen 2 by 2
eventually we will see Gen 2 by 4 or Gen
3 by 4 for example all the time giving
you more bandwidth of course we're going
to eat fast SSDs to actually take
advantage of that so now that we've
talked a bit about m2 and
let's move on to our review portion of
the ADATA SP 900 m2 2280 drive i tested
this drive in an AZ rock killer z97
motherboard and that has support for
both PCI Express as well as SATA and two
drives for the SSD we have a Sam force
SF 2281 controller this is a solid
controller and it's actually much more
reliable than previous generations of
sand force controllers fortunately does
require compressible data to really
perform it likes compressible data but
not quite so much for incompressible
also this is a special version of the SF
2281 sand first has work so magic with
it that lets you actually use 100% of
the drives capacity so this is why it's
a 256 gigabyte Drive and now a 240
gigabyte Drive then and that 880 is
using here since this is kind of a
mid-range SSD is mlc asynchronous which
is a little bit slower than synchronous
NAND this also has a three year warranty
and it's got support for all the
important SSD things that you would want
like trim support and dev sleep or
device sleep to save power when your
device is not in use it's available as a
twenty to forty two or a 20 to 80 form
factor M to variety drive and there's
also a 2.5 inch variance of a SP 932 now
the performance of the SP 900 is I don't
want to say disappointing here it's just
the same it's still a serial ata drive
it's still using the serial ata protocol
even though it's an MDOT two connected
drive so we're going to see the same
peak performance here as we see on a
regular serial ata drive and this is
also going to show these slightly slower
than the fastest SSDs currently
available performance that we would
expect from a mid-range stand force SF
2281 Drive with asynchronous NAND flash
memory it's easily going to keep up with
comparable SATA SSDs I was able to hit
all of the advertised numbers on the box
in my benchmarks and of course we're
going to see getting outpaced here by
the Plex store m6e which is a PCI
Express Gen 2x2 drive which gives it
additional bandwidth that the SP 900
cannot take advantage of so to summarize
my review of the ADATA SP 900 I would
like to point out that anyone who is
jumping from a mechanical hard drive to
an SSD is going to see a vast
improvement in their day-to-day
computing experience the response time
is there and the speed is there to give
you
just a much more my computer is already
always ready for anything I throw at it
kind of feeling now I think there's a
niche that this Drive will really fit in
specific and that is folks who already
have a notebook or laptop that has an
MDOT two SATA slot already built into it
and is ready for an upgrade that in my
opinion is what this drive is really
built for and fortunately there's
actually quite a few notebooks out there
that fit that bill that includes the
Lenovo ThinkPad x1 carbon gen 2 the msi
gs70 nee Vaio duo 13 and vaio pro 13
just to name a few so if your notebook
is ready for this drive I think it's a
great upgrade now for other folks who
might be considering something like this
in particular for your desktop users out
there myself included I would say that
well if you have an MDOT to PCI Express
slot in your desktop for example well
you just you can't use this drive period
if you have a slot that has a hybrid
solution that does serial ata as well as
PCI Express like our asrock motherboard
did I would recommend waiting and going
with an MDOT 2 PCI Express solution I
won't drive that I would love to
recommend assuming it lives up to the
hype and it actually is released to
market and my friends at a data can
actually 71 hi if you're watching this
friends add a data and that drive is the
forgive me SR 1020 NP and the benefits
of that drive is its PCI Express Gen 2
by 4 and it features the newest
SandForce
SF 3700 series controller which I think
is going to be pretty awesome once we
can get our hands on it of course but
that is all for this video guys thank
you so much for watching leave me a
comment in the comment section down
below let me know what's next generation
storage drive you are most looking
forward to
whether it be m dot 2 SATA Express or
some other fancy drive connection types
that I have no idea even exist yet don't
forget to thumbs up button tool are you
down there we'll see you all very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
