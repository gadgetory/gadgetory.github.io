beer there's a beer now everything's I
love it everything comes together yeah
at the last minute because cuz like a
half an hour ago I was I was like as I
can't do the show hold offices cancel it
thankfully things have come together
hello everyone welcome to awesome
hardware this is episode number 180 and
this is a weekly show we talk about
technology and computer parts and other
random stuff do it at Tuesday do it on
Tuesday evenings at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time we stream live to twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware the entire show on
YouTube we split it up because it's a
collaboration with my friend Kyle here
so first half's gonna be on my channel
pulsar we're second half will be Kyle's
channel bit wit and then the third half
will also glow the third part which is
the after-party
will also be on Cal's channel at which
point we will give shout outs to people
who have made donation comments and also
people who have lots stuff from our
stores speed of our stores if you like
our stuff and you want to buy our stuff
check out our stories and I have
actually huge announcement Oh
huge announcement in development for
just many many years now many years in
the making well over a year and sistas
nicely my fault what did you make a CPU
or something yeah it just it took a long
time it went through a lot a lot of
different iterations and I also
sometimes go months and months between
answering emails a pulsar Burnett is my
store now this is the new design which
kept the captive thumb screw is a thumb
screw and in jail yes that is Kyle that
it is the captive thumb screw show your
friends and they'll be like what is on
your shirt and your dude I think it's a
captain thumbs here get it done oh oh so
yeah that's the new design I hope you
guys like it it's available on several
different items shirts a hoodie few
different shirts anyway so buy that all
the other stuff also still available in
the store so check it out
Kyle's store is big with tech slash
store and he also has a wide arrangement
of stuff and it's all very good nothing
new on mice not very good things but no
there's nothing new for Kyle yeah no no
funny no funny pun t-shirts to speak of
so
before it takes a while to develop those
you know yeah I did I did want to give a
shout out to the artist who developed
that shirt her name is Britta and you
can find her on Facebook under terror
bunny studios I like the name which is
pretty awesome she does some cool art
work there so cool check it out anyway
thanks Britta feel sorry I took so long
to follow up on stuff but she did a
great job all right moving along Oh
clipboard of burning we occasionally use
adult language on the show so cover your
ears
dad don't listen to anything else and we
also drink alcohol beer typically feel
free to join us if you're of age and
drink responsibly of course Cheers for
joining us I need to unpack his niece my
arrogant bastard bazarian bastards very
arrogant bastard I need to find my
glasses
I lost my glasses somewhere in the move
Oh No yeah I was kind of thinking like
what are these chintzy yeah the garbage
they look all too fancy for our taste
they're kind of thin like I feel like
we're yeah in danger of right adds an
element of danger to the show today
drinking all right let's talk some tech
news my have is probably gonna be
relatively short today cuz I've only got
like four four things to talk about
this one's kind of interesting though
somewhat unexpected for me but intel has
now debuted this new specification
called C XL c XL 1.0 to be specific
compute express link is what it stands
for and this is joining already sort of
a small group of next generation host to
device and device to device
high-speed interconnects if you don't
know what that is like PCI Express it's
probably the one that you're most
familiar with most motherboards right
now use PCI Express gen3
we're expecting PCI Express Gen 4 later
this year probably AMD motherboards and
we expect it probably from Intel as well
once they launch their next-gen of stuff
but this is actually kind of more more
tied in with PCIe Jen with just why I
thought it was also interesting and also
kind of confusing I'm sure
there's gonna be more on this coming out
because this is a fairly new story this
is a written up by Ian over on an antic
by the way it's been in development for
four years though and it was supported
by a consortium of nine companies
including Alibaba Cisco Dell EMC
Facebook Google HPE Huawei Intel and
Microsoft it's quite a list which is
those are all very substantial companies
it's going to begin as a cache coherent
host to device interconnects focusing on
GPUs and FPGAs and you guys might be
aware that Intel is developing graphics
cards they've they've made no secret of
that recently they've they've even hired
a few former AMD people who now work in
Intel turncoats all of them but the
point being Intel developing GPUs also
developing this interconnect it just
kind of makes me think like a why are
they doing this they're also using
current PCIe 5.0 standards for physical
connectivity and electrical standards so
the slot physically if I'm reading this
right is going to be exactly the same as
a PCIe slot it's gonna be wired up the
same but it's going to be different it
says it's an open standard so that's
usually good the focus of cxl is to help
accelerate AI machine learning media
services HPC and cloud applications
which are all very important especially
to big companies such as a consortium of
companies it is all in cahoots to
develop this so I guess you know it's
it's it's kind of a new thing that's out
there it's it's gonna play around with
the other next-gen interconnects such as
NV link CCI X and Gen Z that have come
out in recent years and we're not sure
the the interesting thing the article
point outs points out is that some of
the members of this consortium were also
parts of other consortiums that develop
stuff like Gen Z and whatnot and there's
statements from each company quoted in
the article the articles linked in the
description by the way and they're all
basically saying like no these are going
to compete there
they're gonna dovetail or overlap or
whatever whatever that means so anyway
well we'll keep an eye on this I'm
curious as far as like obviously Intel's
going to be on board but you know is
this gonna be something that affects the
desktop graphic space probably at some
point is it going to be something where
like you can get an in some other board
that has PCI Express Gen 5 and C CL cxl
support for these new Intel graphics
cards that you plug them in there at
work see Excel if there if if there is
any kind of like you know intelligence
with the design and if they're using the
same interconnects and everything I
would imagine there'd be some sort of
interoperability there so like you could
also use a PCI Express graphics card in
the same slot but does that mean only
Intel graphics cards are going to be
able to take advantage of this standard
is it going to have any advantage or
disadvantage compared just just standard
PCI Express Gen 5 all these questions
will remain questions because we do not
have answers for them but hopefully in
the future
Intel motherboards an edge over am
becoming I mean knowing Intel it seems
like the type of thing that they would
used as a segmenting thing because
they're all about segmentation if you
want to play ball in this arena you know
if you want to if you know overclock
your cpu you got to get a case Q and
this motherboard and you got to pay 50
bucks more for each of them oh yeah 20
or 30 bucks depending on the channel
yeah oh my god oh god stop picking up
coins Kyle panic it's a game boy oh
that's the game voice take my gameboy
it sounds like picking up a coin no 2
came fair enough so yeah now you guys
know that that exists and you're smarter
because of it it's exciting hopefully
yeah I mean I am all for new standards
and if they're doing some magic in there
to make things faster or you know make
it real real fancy interconnect then
then cool but you know as long as they
don't as long as they're not like yeah
charge only we can use this or yeah so a
lot to see if that's something that AMD
Radeon or Nvidia or even Turner
interested in but yeah probably still
too early to go down too far down the
speculation path so let's move on
Microsoft has been testing Android app
mirroring on Windows 10 so how often
have you been on your Windows PC and
been like hey I have this app on my
android phone and I sure would like to
use it on my Windows PC wouldn't that be
cool have you has that ever happened to
you maybe it hasn't no but I imagine for
some people it has I'm sure if for
nothing else then you know you could
look at it but what if you did phone
videos and you wanted to record and you
just use a screencap app for your phone
probably but what if you wanted to
record directly under your computer then
you could do that anyway
it opens up a lot of possibilities point
being I barely read this story because
you read it first and you made a bunch
of notes for it for me so Kyle
I mean so yeah I didn't realize that
Paul had already snagged the story just
Google Doc so I actually snagged it I
actually stole it and wrote all the
notes for it but I don't mind yeah but
yeah I mean it's it's it it's pretty
self-explanatory it's a mirroring app
it's actually an app that already exists
called your app is it called your the
your phone at your phone and windows a
weird name your phone is in the name of
the app and it lets it's been letting
people interact with their Android
phones from any Windows 10 device that
that functionality is being expanded now
so that you get like full keyboard and
mouse interfacing with with with a
mirrored version of your phone on your
desktop on your Windows 10 desktop it's
kind of coincidental dude that this
article popped up because you follow
Quinne snazzy snazzy labs on twitter yes
he just posted a tweet where he's like
this is what people are talking about
when they say the Apple ecosystem so
cool and he
he basically like had his phone
connected to his computer and then he
wanted to like tweet from his desktop he
wanted to tweet something like a picture
that was on his phone and it just
automatically recognized that you know
there were photos on his phone he just
like tapped share on his phone and it
automatically uploaded it to his to his
account which you know is is pretty cool
considering that like I generally have
to email myself a photo from my phone
you know if I want to like tweet that
from from my desktop do whatever reason
do you have to or is that just a way you
know how to do it and so that's just the
way you've used every time and not
explored other ways to possibly do it
that's that's me that's and I say that
because that's know absolutely what I'm
what I'm saying though is like it is
what it is like you have to find other
third-party solutions to make that
happen
whereas with Quinn's example it's all
taking place within the same ecosystem
this seems to be this this article is
talking about a solution that's
potentially a step in that direction to
sort of make the whole process a bit
more seamless grade you have to have
Android obviously and now that windows
phones are out androids pretty much the
only thing supported at the moment but I
could see a lot of uses for this I
personally don't have many but just the
fact that you could I think I think it
would be useful for like you said like
phone reviewers definitely like being
able to just interface with your phone
with a mouse or a keyboard - or like use
obs to capture your phone screen as
opposed to some Google Play app or
whatever it is so there are
possibilities that I'm sure people will
do some fun stuff with it
but you have to have bluetooth with
low-energy peripheral mode which I'm not
too familiar with and check the support
you can check to see if your system
supports it by right-clicking the Start
menu going to your device manager and
then expanding the Bluetooth option and
checking under properties for for
Bluetooth radio you have to look for
Bluetooth radio supports low-energy
peripheral
roll I don't even know if any of my
systems support that I don't know what
hardware is required if that's just like
built into Bluetooth 4.0 or something or
or I don't know what what qualifies us I
don't know specifically but most
motherboards will have like a Wi-Fi
Bluetooth combo adapter with that and as
that was it's as long as if it's a
relatively recent one the Bluetooth
standard sort of update over time it's
probably a mode that's integrated and
it's part of one of those Bluetooth
standard updates to me it's just like
older versions of Bluetooth that might
not have it yeah or something like that
so okay and then Microsoft's also
recommending build 18 3 3 5 plus to run
the future cell says the Bluetooth 4.0
started with low-power spec okay yeah so
if you anything that sounds reasonable
to me
yep so would never lie selves always
ring he's that's why we hired him
practically I'm never doing all right so
that's that's pretty much it I feel like
I took over your site here at night
that's exactly what I was planning to do
it I mean all the others like I said you
have to be one of my star just wanna
show today I was very unprepared
no no fair enough so that's the one that
story I was like all right Kyle's got me
having that one cool really take the
notes for other stories while I was
rattling off that no everything else is
got super superb notes you're super
prepared from this point speaking of
superb notes WCC F Tech should fix their
freaking the edge of their WCC f tech
put like the tiniest gap like right on
the left side of your website like
there's almost no space but you ever
heard of a version the head like a
margin that would be cool please
maybe it's an aesthetic thing no it
looks aesthetically terrible anyway
Alessio Palumbo and this must be I'm not
familiar with Alessi of it Nvidia is an
ending driver support for 3d vision wait
that I expected you to break down in
tears they hadn't already ended it
anything who who is still using this I
have a 3d vision set of glasses what are
you using them that I bought on a lark
it from a new egg warehouse sale that
I've never taken out of the box but the
point is I have them and maybe I would
have wanted to try them out in the
future
I remember what an NVIDIA rep came to
our studio a new egg they showed us the
technology for the first time I like
here this one that is the future one of
the Batman games we face is like
flipping the coin need to see the coin
like like almost like it flipped into
your eye and it goes back whoa with the
3d glasses and stuff super cool
yeah and that was the first and last
time I ever heard see I have heard so
many people have had that experience
that you have had and now it's being
snuffed out by Nvidia because apparently
it sucks and no one uses it after
general release for 18 which is coming
out in April 20 19 3 D vision will no
longer be supported I don't know this
means that you're gonna need to like use
an older driver in order to use 3d
vision at all or if it just means
they're ending future support for
further games and everything the way
they support have supported it is they
have kind of a standard driver software
package that game developers can work
with - or a game developer can work with
it or they can just like you can just
turn it on in the game but if the game
hasn't had some sort of ad hoc support
with the driver which is rare then they
end up getting artifacts and stuff like
that for the game itself so that's been
an issue what else oh yeah prolonged use
often leads to headaches kind of sucks
and they who knew three men glasses and
then you're game for the game
performance itself is heavy because it's
got a rendering or two for each for each
eye
yeah similar situation to VR but um yeah
so all that sucks but in case you're at
all interested in the history of this
fine technology it was originally
introduced by a video back in 2008 yeah
you got a pair of LC shutter glasses
which you can see in this stylized image
here
the glasses don't actually show you know
a car driving out of the side driving on
either side our head that's just to make
it look cooler than it actually is but
yeah there was also an infrared emitter
device that went on the monitor one of
my monitors that I have is a high
refresh rate monitor with an integrated
nvidia emitter for 3d vision I have one
too yeah yeah which F difference between
either survived before but that's so it
exists that's the other thing is like
like yeah definitely fresh straight
display 120 Hertz are buffs me1 60 Hertz
per eye anyone using 3d vision a 3d
vision capable monitor I mean didn't
they stop making 3d vision capable
capable monitors like years ago like
that when you when you get just the the
frames they come with an emitter okay so
they didn't you know they your monitor
just needs to have specs that make this
meet the standard so how did 20 Hertz
refresh rate or above okay and I don't
know if there's any other there are some
CRT monitors and some DLP projectors and
also work with it but yet there is a
standalone emitter don't grab it that
you can use it with gotcha so anyway
what do who cares about all that because
it's being cancelled sayonara
um now I will just have my glasses to
use for like skits and stuff for like
like it cuz they're skit skit yeah
they're they're basically now like a
like a aesthetic accessory for me oh
because they lay there kind of like big
and bulky and they kinda they kind of
have like an 80s future look yeah it's
light anyway so they weren't the most
comfortable yeah anyway I'm not good for
prolonged painting so long 3d vision rip
speaking of rip riddance
windows 7 rip windows 7 windows 7 is not
dead yet
it's dead soon though the 5 year
extended support period for Windows 7
will be ending January 14th 2020 this
sounds like you could have term it you
could have easily spun these last few
stories into a new segment I could have
called death you know if I had like
another
or to do show prep I probably would have
had better show prep all the all the
miss stuff you know he's fine it's fine
like rats yeah and you know that just
gives us you know the last time we did
the show here we were trying to reset
you know to a very low standard of
character and quality and stuff so oh
yeah this is a big step up absolutely
and that's that's for everyone watching
agrees how much better we are now so
yeah if you're use if you're one of
those diehard Windows 7 users who
anytime people is like oh my Windows 10
automatically restarted on me or like my
Windows 10 is sending telemetry or Jerry
was ranting today about Windows 10
sending a bunch of pack data packets to
Microsoft Windows 10 spying on my Putin
apps point being all you windows 7 you
know elitists will now be brought into
the fold with the rest of us because
your options are gonna be paying for
three more years of support which
appears to only be available to
organizations so that's possible because
there's lots of companies that you know
they stick with what works so that's
gonna be possible for some people but
for most you know you're either gonna
have to deal with using an operating
system that's now on you no longer
getting security updates which just
isn't a good idea or you know you got
Windows 8 or 8.1 or 8 and what did they
end up calling Windows 8 afterwards
windows 8 no one remembers because it
wasn't worth remember I know is 8 after
it was updated for like a year like
actually became fairly tolerable but
then of course there's Windows 10 or you
know you can install Linux or something
like that that would be that'd be fun
that's just a hole hole hole of a rabbit
hole the hole yeah I mean to figure out
how to be a super user and stuff like
that after watch a lot of wendel videos
uh-huh
so to warn you to let you know that this
terrible day is coming you're going to
start seeing pop-ups on your Windows 7
computer letting you know that this
support period is ending it will be a
courtesy reminder telling you security
updates will cease and weather and and
also the
Windows 10 is a thing that exists in
case you're interested in upgrading
Microsoft promises that the message will
only appear a handful of times
quote-unquote nice and vague during 2019
and that there will be a do not notify
me again checkbox that will definitely
suppress any future messages I don't
believe that first definitely and
completely you ever get that pop up for
Windows 10 that says whenever you launch
a game it says it looks like some of
your apps are blurry click here to fix
apps that are blurry
yeah do you know how to actually make it
stop doing that I just got it recently
so I haven't looked into it but okay
what's what's the because when you say
you wanna notify me again it's still
notice you want it you want to actually
pull up the this thing in order to go
ahead to go in there and tell what to do
that thing cuz I've had that happen to
me about guys that's really annoying I
love how they it's cuz the game you're
loading is changing the resolution right
and that pop-ups is meant so that if you
change the resolution to a non-native
resolution or you're just changing
resolutions in general you know it's got
some wind stupid windows wizard thing
that's supposed to help make stuff look
not blurry I guess but let me change the
resolution windows I know yeah it's
being a vision of one alright
speaking of other segments right never
there's I have one more segment where
you can ask are you doing hot meet hot
and heavy hard work no you're not no no
you're doing Games report I'm just doing
to my PC and news gonna change this
changing this - oh yeah I forgot to
switch that over to you today we don't
have we don't haven't asked the audience
here really okay no yeah suddenly tell
my player yes and we're just gonna go
choose the cupcake the Jews the cupcake
same thing technically this is ask the
audience I have a single question to ask
you guys oh so we're gonna pull you guys
Cal and I will ourselves guess on which
answer is going to win and honestly this
is something that I'm curious to know
the answer to so hopefully we can get
some links posted in chat
wait I can probably help with that there
we go
strawpoll linkit Dredd there now thank
yourself for the help and here's the
question what are you waiting for it and
specifically when it comes to PC
building because I know there's a lot of
people who are like anytime you talk
about something new that I got I'm gonna
pass on this I'm waiting for this so
anyone who's out there who's like
waiting to build a new computer waiting
to do a significant upgrade on their
existing computer what are you waiting
for it the last box is so dark well I
mean you can figure it figure that can
be generically applied to you know
getting money randomly that you didn't
pay for you didn't earn I guess I was
just a windfall of memory of some sort
waiting for the lottery mister so III
put my presumptive things that people
might be waiting for us we got Navi from
from Radeon sir
new new AMD Radeon GPUs should be coming
out and this is this is not going to be
Vega seven nanometer this is going to be
Navi designed specifically for seven
nanometer and hopefully that'll be good
yeah seven nanometer CPUs from AMD those
should become a supposedly later this
year we're looking looking coputex
timeframe we got ten nanometer CPUs from
Intel it's been waiting long enough for
that yeah
affordable GPUs from Nvidia because
NVIDIA has launched new GPUs you know
this year and last but the price ranges
have been pretty astronomical especially
if you want something high-end and then
of course it might just be you don't
have the money so maybe it right maybe
you just need more money and I you know
and when I originally conceptualized
this question I had a couple other ideas
in my head but they I forgot to put them
on it it just it doesn't matter so there
is this a tough one it is it is tough
they're all quiet that's why it's such a
good question I'm torn between two
I think do I have to go first or do you
you should go first I made up the
question all right like I can't you
choose fuck you all right I'm gonna say
it's a double-edged sword but I'm gonna
say Navi from Radeon okay why because
hey NVIDIA needs it because Nvidia is
dominating they've been dominating the
GPU space for for far too long at least
in the the mid to high-end space and I
think there's the least amount of
competition when it comes to graphics
cards so I just want what's good for the
consumer because what's good for the
consumer is obviously good for me and I
would like to see
AMD personally kill it in the GPU side
of things like they have been with CPU
I'm not as excited for seven nanometer
AMD because I already kind of have
confidence that I feel like it's easier
to predict or project how that's going
to land Navi is going to be the thing
that's either going to be a total flop
or exactly what the community needs so I
think it's more exciting to see which
way the coin will fall with that and ten
enemy or CPUs for Minto I mean Intel's
already at the top of their game when it
comes to CPU performance obviously
they're there pricing and stuff doesn't
compare with AMD like price performance
and whatnot but yeah I want to see more
more GPUs so I'm gonna say nothing all
right that's reasonable since I got to
pick one I'm gonna go with 10 nanometer
CPUs from Intel and that's just cuz I
wanted to I wanted to pick one and it
probably isn't gonna be the winner but
hear me out here 10 nanometer CPUs from
Intel lots of anticipation people could
have been could have said the same thing
two years ago I'm waiting for these 10
nanometer
CPUs and Intel's talking about to come
then then I will upgrade it and build a
new computer so maybe there are people
who have been waiting that long so
that's one group but then you've also
got like you said the fact that Intel
CPUs simply put if you're looking at
single core performance and if you're
looking at the best gaming performance
that's what you go with
that's why Intel is still comfortable
selling a ninety nine hundred K for over
five hundred dollars and so forth but if
you look at the last few generations of
Intel going from the 6000 series to the
7000 series to the 8000 series to the
9000 series all on LGA 1151 all on 14
nanometer and all clock for clock if you
put them at the same clock speed they're
the same performance they've gotten more
clock speed out of it they've made a few
other changes by adding making like a
soldered IHS and for the newest ones and
everything but you still haven't seen
that that boost from micro
microarchitecture upgrade because
they've still just been doing
refinements of something that they've
been working with for quite some time
now
so that combined with the fact that 10
nanometer has been you know cooking for
so long maybe means that there's a lot
of people anticipating that we might
actually see a decent jump when it comes
to actual performance at the same clock
speed that's so that's the that's the
excuse I came up with in my head for
backing up my decision I will say I love
for the thing that I would look for that
I look forward to most with 10 nanometer
until it is just better efficiency and
like lower temperatures so I could cram
faster gaming CPUs into like super tiny
small form-factor systems now because
any time that's like in like an
objective of mine like I always look to
rise in the first because it's just way
easier to cool you know the temperature
per cores or whatever just forget about
it with a 40 nanometer Intel chip so
yeah I definitely agree with you on that
alright let's see what the audience said
let's see it I'm going to vote for a
rich relative to leave
levy money 790 Wow both of us we're
wrong I vow I picked I fix them I picked
the loser damn so seven eight nobody
cares about that lots of people waiting
for those seven nanometer CPUs from AMD
I will say of course I should have
picked that because then I would have
won yeah but dominating I think there's
also a lot of people who are excited
about the form factor combined with the
cork out like if you really can on am
for get a 16 core 32 thread and CPU as
is anticipated with to rise and dies on
it that's that's pretty nice
that's awesome and then of course lots
of people waiting for money you know
more people interested in just in video
to bring their prices down than actual
Navi so you can you can tell the sort of
damper that I feel like the last few AMD
radeon GPU launches have kind of put on
people so that said but we do we do need
that we do need some more that so sure
alright that's that's all I got for my
half yeah thank you guys all for
watching thank you all for those of you
who have maybe left on nation comments
again we will be reading those and
responding to them in the after party
and I'm totally gonna update my
description so it has a link to the
after party too but I'll do that once
kyle's half starts which is also linked
in the description so click on that if
you're watching on YouTube will be
starting there in just a moment if
you're on Twitch stay right where you
are just a moment and we'll be right
back thanks for watching guys just comes
