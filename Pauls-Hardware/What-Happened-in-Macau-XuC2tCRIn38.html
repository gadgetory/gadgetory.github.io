24 hours of travel be scared off by
making her way over to LAX jumped on a
plane with type A it's about a 13 hour
flights from LAX to tpe and you guys all
thought that that's where we're going to
stop but no you kept going after that we
have maybe a three hour layover and then
we made our way to here where we're at
right now this is Macau which is in
China it's kind of on the southeast
coast it's across the river from Hong
Kong and it's sometimes described as
Chinese version of Las Vegas because
there's casinos here we've just been
kind of touring around within those but
in case you guys are wondering we are
here with AMD we did have some
fascinating new information shared with
us from AMD I know we can't tell you
what any of that information is please
not yet but I thought it was pretty
exactly
yeah it was interesting again like I
wish we could tell you more details but
stay tuned for that in future videos in
the future this is just going to be a
quick little blog to the kind of show
you some of the stuff we've been doing
so far and I'm going to try to separate
my blogs I'm going to do a few of them
from the regular content covering
computex yeah that's not it are you
enjoying the trip so far cal yes I'm
enjoying the trip however I'm not
enjoying the humidity it's really humid
here yeah broadcast wedding that we were
wandering around inside the casinos
because they do a decent job to keep the
humidity out AC on it's kind of nice we
just wandered through
yeah like the Venetian in Macau which we
were told is like the exact same as the
venetian
Las Vegas it's a close replica but not
exact and probably the biggest
difference between the Venetian here in
the one who biggest is that they don't
have cocktail service here when you're
playing the games are so weak as far as
we can tell no one seemed to be drinking
definitely a little bit more mellow here
everyone had water I've been drinking
water I mean it's Sunday morning so the
most hydrated casino I've ever seen it's
true but it's good you guys behind yeah
hey guys this is I just want to keep
this shirt but give you guys an update
to where we have we're leaving the cow
little bit later today just a few hours
go back to Taipei we check into our
Airbnb
situated it's going to be awesome and we
have a whole week planned of meetings
and reveals new products I like it's
tough to be exciting but I want to end
this video by sharing with you a little
bit of footage I got yesterday it was
from the idea that i think i could show
this to you this is austin evidence in
the grace and beauty a virtual reality
hood here is he austin evidence in his
native environment virtual reality watch
