to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster for some reason I seem to
run into linus a lot on this Computex
trip and he actually took me up to see
street comm with him where he had an
appointment where I saw a couple unique
new products I wanted to share with you
guys the first one is the DB 6 and this
is a completely passively cooled
computer it's a mini ITX chassis and it
says support to cool 825 watt CPU 125
watt GPU now street comm teams up with
cal u s-- and kaleo's actually
manufactures the full loop heat pipe
which is what allows this to be
passively cooled the heat pipe travels
in and makes contact with the GPU block
and the CPU block and then goes out into
the side panels of the case which are
basically massive aluminium heat sinks I
can tell you standing over this thing it
was quite warm because it is passively
cooled but it's radiating heat out the
sides so you're not gonna want to sit
right next to it but of course being
passively cooled it pretty much makes
zero noise it has a tempered glass front
panel and a tempered glass top panel
that lets you get a look down into case
itself and Street comms said that they
are working on potentially a version of
this that can just cool to CPU and then
one that adds the GPU support as well if
it's just going to be the CPU cool
version they're probably going to have a
price point around $350 although bear in
mind this is really really early on so
that could change and then you'd have to
add about 150 more dollars to add the
GPU cooling solution to the GPU they
have in there right now as a GTX 1060 so
if you're looking at all this and
thinking wow that's pretty expensive
well you're right for what you get but
it is completely passively cool and
that's not easy to do and there is a
pretty passionate subgroup of PC
enthusiasts who love everything to be
passively cooled so hopefully if any of
you guys are watching you're enjoying
checking out the db6 streak al also had
on display basically the cutest little
test bench that you ever did see this is
the BC One mini bench its mini ITX and
if you guys are thinking who who needs a
mini ITX open-air test bench I don't
know but I kind of want one now just
because it's so tiny and so cute it's
going to retail for about $120 it's
going to come in silver red and black
options
and just like its Big Brother all of the
hardware mounts to the board itself and
then can fold flat and has a little
carrying handle for easy transportation
so guys that's all for this video I know
it was a quick one but I wanted to give
you a quick look at these unique little
products from spree comm of course a
quick thank you to all of my sponsors
for Computex 2017 EVGA MSI g.skill
Tesoro and coolermaster we'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
