description and get inspired for your
next project well guys it's been a crazy
year for high-end desktop PCs we've gone
from 10 cores per CPU maximum last year
in 2016 to now as many as 18 with
today's launch of the highest end
fastest most Core County and most
expensive CPUs Intel has ever suggested
a mere home enthusiast purchase the core
I 979 ATX e XE Mini Extreme Edition is
what I'll be taking a look at today and
sharing some introductory benchmarks I'm
also going to be taking a look at the 16
cores 79 60 X which will retail for
$1,700 currently installed in my test
bed right now the 79 80 XE goes for two
large $2,000 so neither of these CPUs
are meant for those with limited
disposable income but since when has
limited disposable income stopped a
hardcore PC enthusiasts specs have been
disclosed already but I'm going to run
down them really quickly all of Intel's
current CPUs are manufactured using 14
nanometer processes technology so it's
kind of nice to have that parity between
their mainstream and high-end parts and
for the enthusiast platform the
motherboards use the X 299 chipset and
LGA 2066
socket six core and up CPUs on this
platform which are the only ones worth
discussing are based on skylake X
architecture and prior to today the top
version was the 10 core 20 thread I 970
900 X Intel is adding 12 14 16 and 18
core CPUs to the lineup now and they'll
cost twelve hundred fourteen hundred
seventeen hundred and two thousand
dollars at retail respectively now all
turbo boost up over four gigahertz when
they're only running on a few course to
improve single core performance and
turbo boost max 3.0 allows a couple
cores per CPU to run at 4.4 or 4.5
gigahertz when running tasks that use
only one or two threads you get one
megabyte of l2 cache
or basically so 18 Meg's for the 18 core
and so on down the line and the 14 core
entire CPUs have a 165 watt TDP finally
there's 44 PCI Express 3.0 lanes
directly connected to the CPU as long as
you spend $1,000 or more on this ten
core 7900 X or better and you can also
game on this platform I should mention
but practically speaking it's really
made for processing intensive
workstation tasks such as 4k video
editing 3d design or physics simulations
all that said let's dive into the
benchmarks so I have a new testbed set
up and I need to say big thank you to
both Intel for sending these CPUs over
as well as Asus who coincidentally sent
over their rampage 6 extreme just in
time for this lunch so I of course
installed that and got it set up
apart from that motherboard I'm using
the g.skill trident z RGB memory it's a
3200 speed kit running at casa latency
14 I have an Asus GTX 1080 Ti Strix
Edition running at the out-of-the-box
overclocked speeds for storage I have a
Toshiba ocz Rd 400 512 gig nvme SSD and
for cooling on the cpu I have the NZXT
kraken X 62 it's a 280 mm meter
closed-loop cooler it's been doing an
excellent job so far and powering
everything as a Rosewill tachyon 1,000
watt 8 plus Platinum rated power supply
our first test is Cinebench and the
multi-threaded tests here I have a range
of CPUs to compare it to even some
mainstream CPUs and here you can see the
big difference in raw compute
performance when using all the threads
79-80 x key with the 3400 score biggest
score I have seen on this platform with
a mainstream consumer level processor
that's pretty insane just about 200
points less on the 79 60 X 19 50 X
coming in just shy of 3,000 and then on
down the line next up is Cinebench
single threaded and here we can see the
single core performance deficit for the
Rison based processors the 1950 X and
1800 X granted all these processors are
running at stock speeds so yes you can
get a little bit more performance out of
those if you do run them overclocked at
4 or 4.1 gigahertz but overall the cab
you lake or skylake depending on which
architecture you want to call it
performance of both the 7700 K as well
as the x-series CPUs from Intel are
pulling
with scores all above the 190 mark next
up a CPU mark in the overall test again
a synthetic test but shows you the
performance you can get out of using all
of your cores at the same time and here
the 1950 X came in with twenty four
thousand four hundred which was a bit
behind the 79 60 X so here again with 16
cores versus 16 cores getting better
performance out of the 79 60 X granted
it does cost more as well then of course
again the 79 80 XC coming in with the
massive 28 thousand 200 and CPU mark
single-threaded we see scores that are
roughly similar to what we saw with
Cinebench single-threaded we have the
risin be CPUs coming in with scores
around 2050 and our Intel skylake X CPUs
coming in with scores more in the 2500
range 7700 K is still proving it is the
single core Beast coming in with a score
of 26 51 that is due to its high
frequency I think by and large next up
is blender a very popular rendering
utility for 3d artwork and otherwise and
here I have updated my tests thanks to
some feedback that I got last time
around so there you go the numbers
should speak for themselves here again
the 79 80 XE is pretty dominant when it
comes to performance next up is pov-ray
3.7 a very popular ray tracing utility
this is just time and seconds so lower
is better on the scores here and again
the 79 80 X II comes out ahead with a 39
second score 79 60 X coming up just
behind and then a few seconds behind
that is the 1950 X we've got two Adobe
Premiere Pro rendering a 4k video at 48
megabits per second this is time in
seconds once again soloist is better and
lowest here is actually the 79 60 X so
here is an indication where 18 cores is
maybe a little bit too much for the
software to deal with this was kind of
my assumption here I mean we've gone
from like I said 20 threads or so last
year to applications dealing with 36 or
more threads this year so this may be a
situation where Premiere Pro just didn't
exactly know what to do with that extra
horsepower allowing the 79 60 X with its
higher clock speed to come in with a
slightly better score that said the 1950
X is a little bit slower here but
they're all still sort of
well within the range of each other only
about a 15 second difference
moving over to some game test starting
with 3dmark firestrike ultra I have the
overall and graphics scores here but I
want to mainly focus on the physics
score because that is where you're gonna
see the most difference when it comes to
actual CPU performance here we saw again
a bit of an anomaly with the 79 60 X
coming out with the highest score of
about 28,500 whereas the 1950 X and 79
80 X e came in with scores around 26,000
a little closer to 27 so here again as a
situation where I believe the software
is not able to take advantage of all the
cores and threads that are available to
79 80 X e therefore you're seeing better
performance out of the higher clock
speeds of the 79 60 X so here's a
situation where maybe the top-end CPU
isn't necessarily all it's cracked up to
be
maybe maybe the 16 core is a little bit
more practical of course software
updates might change this in the future
moving on to 3d mark x by again we can
see the CPU score is the main gonna be
the main focus and here we saw a very
similar CPU score I think again this is
a situation where you're not seeing the
software scale with the number of
threads that's available because we saw
a very similar scores not just between
the 79 80 extreme edition and 79 60 X
with the 79 60 X winning but also very
comparable to the 1950 X and 70 900 X
indicating the maybe 3d mark times by at
least doesn't like more than 10 cores
that's that's what I'm going with here
not only a quick game test of GTA 5
running at 1080 and this is a great way
of seeing if your CPU is holding back a
high end GPU at all I'm with a 1080 Ti
in there this does show some performance
differences depending on what you're
using so the 1950 X and Rison has been
known to not give quite the maximum
performance with GPUs again and
depending on which situation you're in a
1920 by 1080 is a resolution that teases
out more of a difference there however
we can see a score of 134 frames per
second on average for the 1950 X whereas
the 79 60 X actually topped out here
about 156 79 80 xD coming in at 148 so
they're all within a relatively same
range of each other so I think that's
just showing that single core
once again is a bit more important when
it comes strictly to gaming I was
measuring power draw as well since these
are high-end desktops and efficiency
might be a concern of yours just
measuring the power drawn from the wall
and measuring peak power as well as idle
power idle power was a little bit higher
than you get on the mainstream side
in fact hitting close 220 watts with the
79 ATX he installed dropped down by
about 15 watts to about 102 with the 79
and 60 X peak power job for the 79 80 XC
was about 457 watts and for the 79 60 X
was 446 when I was just running the
3dmark mix test and looking at power
drop for that it was actually pulling
about 410 watts on average it's actually
very similar power draw numbers here
when you look at the 79 80 X e compared
to the 1950 X but given that these are
high in to workstation type systems your
expectation is it gonna gonna be that
they're gonna pull more power probably
than a typical gaming PC anyway when it
comes to temperatures is where I was
probably the most impressed when it
comes to these CPUs we had heard that
vrm temps can get pretty hot with X 19 X
299 that's mainly if you're overclocking
which I'm gonna dive into in another
video but with all those cores in there
and the limited amount of space to
disperse the heats I only saw a maximum
of about 62 to 63 degrees Celsius this
is under an 8 s 64 stress test for 15 to
20 minutes with the 79 80 XE and went to
79 60 X didn't get above 60 degrees and
and that's under a stress test or a
decent chunk of time again I'm using the
NZXT d kraken X 62 for this which is a
pretty high-end closed-loop cooler but
not necessarily like a full closed-loop
system or all copper anything like that
so it's nice to know that you can keep
the temps down on these processors still
get that range of turbo boost max 3.0
but not have to worry necessarily about
setting up the custom loop or crazy
overheating or anything like that I
found that the out-of-the-box
performance of both of these CPUs
especially when relative compared
relative to their temperatures was was
quite good actually
so so that's nice but anyway though
let's do some closing thoughts here
clearly the Intel 79 60 X and 79 80 XE
CPUs can outperform AMD's threader for
1950 X but price must also be considered
$1000 for the 1950 X versus 1700 or two
thousand dollars for Intel's options and
here's an example look at cinnamon
scores to compare if you can score three
thousand points for $1000 with the 1950
X that's three points per dollar Intel
79 60 X would only give you about 1.9
points per dollar and the 1980 X II a
bit less at one point seven points per
dollar so the bang for the buck option
here is definitely at the 1950 X in
conclusion though I have to say that the
79 80 XE actually works pretty well as a
halo product for Intel massive
performance across 36 threads stayed
remarkably cool at stock settings and
the turbo boost max 3.0 provides a great
solution to squeeze out more performance
in situations where fewer cores are
being used I regularly saw a four to
four point four gigahertz frequencies on
one or two cores at a time and sometimes
it hit even higher than that although
I'm not sure if that was a reporting bug
or not this supposed to max at four
point four or four point five now the 79
60 X is three hundred dollars cheaper
but it also runs at slightly higher
clock speeds giving it an edge and tasks
where single core performance and
frequency are favored or with software
that just doesn't make use of more than
16 cores or 32 threads also it's a
slightly better value than the Extreme
Edition depending on your work look so
Intel has definitely recaptured the
fastest consumer CPU crown that AMD
stole from them unexpectedly for about a
month or two but who knows what's next
it would actually be kind of cool to see
maybe AMD answer back with more than 16
core thread Ripper CPUs they can fit up
to 32 cores into the thread Ripper
package as they do with the epic server
CPUs that use the same socket ultimately
though whether you lean towards the
Intel x-series CPUs and their price
premium for maximum performance or AMD's
thread Ripper line up for more bang for
your buck there's never been a better
time to build a high-end desktop PC with
as many options as there are right now
from both team red and team blue and
that makes me happy I hope it makes you
guys happy too if it did
and if this video made you happy then
definitely hit thumbs up on your way out
I have links to these products in the
video's description down below I have
more contact coming soon as well as the
continuation and hopefully soon to be
completed arctic panther build thanks to
all of you for you guys feedback on that
one I am going to go take a nap thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
