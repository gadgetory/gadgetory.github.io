external USB 3.0 capture card that
rounds out razor's selection of products
specifically aimed at game streamers who
use live streaming services like twitch
or YouTube gaming get yourself a razor
blade laptop a razor mouse razor
keyboard razor headsets razor mouse mat
a razor siren mic a razor stargazer
webcam and this then take a picture of
yourself using it all while you're
live-streaming and tweet it to raise
their CEO mainly hang ten and he'll be
your best friend forever at a hundred
and eighty US dollars MSRP though this
product definitely isn't cheap so why
would an aspiring twitch streamer drop
their sub dollars on this when webcam
can get the job done I'll have two
reasons one would be capture much higher
quality video footage using an actual
camera with clean HDMI out like a gh4 or
second would be to play your games on
one computer or console I suppose while
streaming the gameplay to the internet
from another computer which requires a
capture card so right out of the gate
there are three features that I like
about this device one is that it uses
USB 3.0 so no buffering or delay like
you get with the Elgato Game Capture HD
60 which is USB 2.0 - it's external and
portable so you can take it on the go
with you and three is that it supports
1080 resolution at 60 frames per second
rather than 30 let's get some details
sorted out though as with all Razer
products the packaging is immaculate you
letter telling you how awesome that you
are for buying a razer product that I
honestly think is so pretty it shouldn't
be framed and very clearly label
accessories these accessories include an
HDMI cable USB 3.0 cable component AV
and component AV multi cables and a 3.5
millimeter audio cable the ripsaw itself
is pretty small weighing in at point 4
pounds or 183 grams and measuring 5.1
inches wide 3.4 inches deep and 0.7
inches tall or 130 by 86 by 17
millimeters for those of you who want to
post in the comment section about how
useless the Imperial measurement system
is the top is a matte black finish with
the razer logo the sides are
unfortunately glossy black plastic which
is bound to get scratched up and the
bottom is rubberized to keep it sitting
still on the front is an LED that will
be red if your drivers aren't set up but
it will be green if things are good to
go as well as two separate 8-inch
audio jacks
so you can connect an mp3 player to
inject music into the stream or a mic to
inject your rants and tap form senses
that moves out of your mouth as you're
trying to gain on the back are the
connectors a mini USB 3.0 out to connect
to your computer a component into use
with your component cable for component
cable connector things or you can use
that multi adapter for older
Playstations and your HDMI in and out to
use the ripsaw you'll need a computer
not a Mac it's not supported but the
computer has to have at least an Intel
desktop core i5 4440 or a mobile I 740
810 MQ processor and NVIDIA GeForce GTX
660 GPU or AMD equivalent thereof USB
3.0 port and Windows 7 or newer now I
didn't crack my ripsaw open but the good
folks over at the twitch subreddit did
after noticing that this device has a
very similar layout to the AVerMedia
live gamer extreme a competing capture
card with a very similar feature set
based on these photos it seems that the
internals are near identical meaning
that they're probably using the same OAM
since I don't have an ever media live
gamer extreme to test and the price of
either card is about the same at a
hundred and eighty bucks now let's
speculate any further as to what this
means but I did want to point it out
testing was very simple I'm happy to say
and after connecting the HDMI in the USB
3 out to the computer and loading the
drivers via the Razer synapse software
the ripsaw was recognized and appeared
as a capture device available in both
xsplit and OBS I wanted to say more
about the testing process here but
there's really not a whole lot to add as
long as my source was outputting
correctly at 1080 xxx or 1080 60 I was
able to configure that on the capture
software side achieve a very nice clean
signal the card won't capture 10-bit
color unfortunately but when recording
footage from my GH 4 it's very sharp I
didn't notice any artifacting our noise
gameplay captured from a second PC also
looked great and the lack of latency
between what's captured and what's
displayed was minimal it's not quite
zero latency like razer claims but it's
almost good enough to actually play in
the preview window on OBS and that's
actually saying quite a bit so to wrap
up this review and the pros column for
the razer ripsaw are the USB 3.0
connectivity the almost zero latency
capture 1080 60 support ability and also
add the convenient audio imports and the
component video capture for older
devices can
and video is analog 1080 and doesn't
have HDCP protection by the way there's
a few people whose eyes just lit up when
i said that for cons i'd have to say
that a DisplayPort connection would have
been nice to support newer video cards
of higher bandwidths but my guess is
that the internals would require an
update as well to support higher
resolution that kind of thing also point
out that the similarity to the
intermediate live gamer extreme is
uncanny
that's more of a neutral point than a
con but if a price war were to break out
between the two of these it would be
hard to recommend the more expensive one
as for other competition I have an
Elgato Game Capture HD 60 that I've
already showed you this is still very
useful I'm still going to use it but it
is clearly inferior to the ripsaw and I
would be remiss if I didn't mention the
new Elgato Game Capture HD 60s which
does have USB 3.0 type C even and
similar performance to the ripsaw when
it comes to latency although it does
lack audio inputs or component video
connectivity ultimately I'm very happy
with the Razer ripsaw and it will
probably stay that way until consumer 4k
capture cards start hitting the market
