sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill where's otech now and if you
guys haven't already gotten this idea
i've been trying to give you as much
footage as I can of all the different
variants of GTX 1080s that are on the
markets or at least available now or
maybe very soon though Tech has two of
them here both of them have custom PCBs
let's start off with this one here this
is these GT X 1080 amp Edition and it
features a dual 100 millimeter I storms
ice storm cooling system two fans there
on the front spectral lighting system so
you get three light up areas on here two
that are right here on the front of the
card and then one back on the zotac logo
beyond that it's of course got the GTX
980 GPU 2560 CUDA cores we don't know
the information as far as what these
cards are going to be shipping at when
it comes to frequency but mostly
overclocked cards we've been seeing or
at least hitting eighteen 1900s
sometimes even closer to 2000 if I had
to guess I'd say this amp extreme right
here probably gonna ship it a bit higher
frequency so this is a beefy beefy card
and they have a demonstration going over
in a case there seems to be dealing with
a little bit of a little bit of sag
there but you know what I've been a
support for this one it worked great
anyways you can tell over built in the
greatest fashion duel 8 pin power
connectors on this one it's got four
points of illumination here on the front
of the card it's also got the push the
limit sign there at the top and then on
the back through the backplate this will
light up as well and you can actually
independently control both of those
using the firestorm software from ZOTAC
which you can also use to overclock the
cards it's got some basic functionality
in there to change all the different
colors activate each individual lighting
zone by itself and then you can do some
you know features that you would expect
such as pulsing breathing and all that
kind of stuff we also have this card
right up here in this case which is just
a prototype they don't have a name for
yet but ZOTAC is planning let's do a
water-cooled card where you just you
know you get the card it's got the block
on and everything we gave them some
feedback on this one I don't think it
looks too bad I want to get rid of that
red ring around there though anyway
those are a couple gtx ten days from
ZOTAC but there's a couple more things
they have here - a VR backpack but let's
so what's in the VR backpack first it's
right over here
so this medium-sized box here is the
Magnus en
which is oh tanks all-in-one system it
comes all together it'll be available in
a few different variants so you'll be
able to get kind of bare-bones where you
can install your own memory and your own
s SD memory an SSD going at the bottom
by the way this clear plexi box here is
just to show you the components that are
inside the larger box but if you can
already tell this whole thing is liquid
cooled it's got a loop that cools both
the CPU as well as a GPU the GPO that's
in there is a gtx 980 by the way it's
also got a 6400 skylake processor and
it's got a very small footprint tons of
i/o on the front as well as on the sides
pretty cool look overall not available
yet but we're told about available very
very soon and the guts of this beast are
the same thing that's powering though
Tech's newest vr backpack or at least
the newest version of that I got a
chance to play around with this I have
to say that's playing with the VR
backpack is a pretty nice experience
especially if you tried VR where you're
tethered to a cable on the ground you
almost immediately get a much freer
sense where you just don't have to worry
about that cable being back there behind
you but they've done a special version
of the en 980 to fit in the backpack
it's got a custom design where they made
a lot thinner it's air cooled instead of
water cooled that's to keep the weight
down it's only about five or five point
five kilos so we noticed that the
backpack was fairly light and pretty
easy to move and move around with it so
it's also got a soft pack on the outside
some mesh to help air flow and
everything and we're told you can even
get in there and do some basic upgrades
just like you can with the en 980 which
is pretty nice now they're working on
the battery solution for this we
recommended that they maybe do a
swappable battery because that would be
nice to have spares along the side the
better they're currently using as a
lithium-ion it'll last up to two hours
so that's pretty good for battery life
but we're kind of going on that yeah
swappable battery I think would be a
good option guys that's all though for
the zotac booth thank you for watching
