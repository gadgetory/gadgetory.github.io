sponsored link in the description for
more information what's up guys welcome
to pauls hardware this is my monthly
builds video for February 2018 haven't
done my monthly builds video for the
past couple months so apologies for that
but at the beginning of every month I
choose a couple computers and I choose
the parts to go into those computers and
I share those lists with you guys and
that's what today's video is all about
in order to help you get a better idea
of how to part out your own system I
will then go later in the month and
actually build the system and if you
want to check out any builds check out
my builds playlist which I'll link in
this video's description where you can
actually see me putting some stuff
together speaking of putting some stuff
together I have actually already built
one of the two systems I'm going to be
talking about today so follow-up video
will come becoming later this week with
a how to build tutorial on this system
and of course I need your feedback as
well so check the video description for
a strawpoll where you can tell me what
builds you want to see in March there's
a few options there hopefully prices
will be somewhat more reasonable by that
time who knows though we've been talking
about that for a while but for today's
first build I have a build that no one
should buy and that is because we're
dealing with some really difficult
pricing issues in the PC component world
right now memory is very expensive and
graphics cards are very expensive so I
want to do a throwback actually to about
a year ago January 2017 I did this
sensible RGB build with a 7600 K and a
gtx 1070 and that total system price was
one thousand two hundred and thirty six
dollars and 81 cents at least according
to pc part picker at the time i will be
using pc part picker for my builds today
and links to everything is down in the
description by the way but this was a
7600 k based system with a z2 70
motherboard and a gtx 1070 one year ago
for just under one thousand two hundred
and fifty dollars so I took the same
base list of components
swapped out a couple things to make it a
bit more current and here's where you
get my first build for today's video
20:18 a stupid overpriced PC that nobody
should buy there's only a single upgrade
to this system compared to last year's
system that's an eighty six hundred K
instead of the seventy six hundred K
which is a six core processor instead of
a four core processor still not hyper
studying on this one so six cores and
six threads and at $250 it is a very
capable gaming processor but there's
plenty of competition now from Rison and
on the rise inside you can get six core
12 thread processors or even eight core
16 thread processors as well as less
expensive motherboards so this is why
I'm less enthused about the 8600 k
overall although if you're willing to
spend the money and your focus is on
gaming it is a very very good processor
for that now the CPU cooler is about the
same price the cryo a gauge seven is
still 35 bucks that's not too bad at all
this is prime Z 370 a solid mid-range
hundred and fifty dollar motherboard and
about hundred fifty dollars is about
what you should be spending for a system
that's gonna cost overall about this
much the g.skill ripjaws four series
memory kit is currently a hundred and
eighty six dollars free shipping though
if you compare that to one year ago that
same kit was $85 it has literally gone
up 100 freaking dollars since last year
which is absolutely ridiculous and I do
not recommend to buying this memory or
indeed any memory that's ridiculously
overpriced unless you absolutely have to
and I still went with a 480 gig SSD I
used a PC part pickers parametric filter
option here just to choose a 480 to 512
gig SSD and sort it by price and that's
what we're coming up with about 125 to
135 dollars for a reasonable 480 gig SSD
and that actually is also about the same
price it was 120 dollars for the 480 gig
last year in our case is the fantex
Eclipse P 400 very solid case $60.00
that's actually $10 less than it was
last year and then finally of course we
have the gtx 1070 itself again here i
have used a parametric filter in order
to just choose gtx 10 70's and sort them
by price and according to pc park picker
you can get one for six hundred and
twenty dollars right now however those
are all lies damned lies and if we
looked at the actual page over here we
see it's supposed to be on sale four and
five
50 to $600 this is supposed to cost
about $400 again by the way so we're
looking at prices that are two to three
hundred dollars over what they should be
but even the outlet PC listing here is
out of stock and if we go over to new a
gets out of stock and I just wanted to
check like are there any 10 70s that you
can actually buy so over on new egg if
we're sorting by price and looking just
the 1070 it does look like you've gotten
a $700 1070 in stock or a $750 1070 in
stock and this is all just stupid and
lame and nobody should buy them for
these prices so so don't don't don't buy
any of this stuff really so yeah this is
a stupid overpriced PC nobody should buy
it I'm gonna can like it puts me in a
strange position being a person who
makes YouTube videos about building
computers and recommending you guys what
parts to buy to just be saying like
don't buy any of this stuff until we
have reasonable graphics cards and
memory prices but that's that's really
where I'm at right now don't spend money
on a computer right now that's my advice
but if you have to if you really need to
or if you're just really excited if you
were like saving up money all last year
to build an entry level gaming PC and
you got to get off the ground somehow
you're tired of console gaming or you've
got a game you really want to play here
is what I would recommend you purchase
and this is a sub $500 gaming PC and
this is using the new risin 320 200 G
that just launched which is an APU which
includes both the CPU and the graphics
processor in the same chip this is a $99
for the 2200 G and yes it is not a
discrete graphics card no it is not
gonna perform equivalent weights like a
1050 or a 1050 TI or anything above that
but it does perfectly adequate 1080p
gaming especially if you're willing to
play on medium or low settings depending
on the game of course and you can check
out my video where I already did a
review with some benchmarks on that's if
you want to see some actual performance
numbers now apart from the 2200 G which
is $100 we have a $100 motherboard we
have a just over $100 memory kit and I'm
torn about this but you got a half
memory for your price for your computer
to work we have a 240 gig SSD a little
$50.00 Thermaltake case and a corsair
500
you want power supply altogether four
hundred and seventy dollars is the price
that you would pay right now assuming of
course that everything is in stock I do
want to point out if you're looking at
the rise in 320 200 G and using my links
their affiliate links down in the
description just so you know double
check and make sure that you're actually
buying from Amazon right now Amazon has
it for $99 but they're temporarily out
of stock you probably can't see that
temporarily out of stock so checking the
auto notify options there to make sure
you're not paying an extra twenty or
thirty dollars for your APU too because
we're all about not overpaying for stuff
this time of year
now the motherboard that I've chosen is
the a B 315 gaming Wi-Fi from gigabyte
it is the motherboard that I already had
that I used for my testing it's about a
hundred dollars and it's a mini ITX so
this is a mini ITX system now once
you've chosen your motherboard go over
to your motherboards website this is the
gigabyte support page and they'll have
downloads and stuff for drivers to go
over to the support list and then
they'll usually have memory support
lists that you can pull up here so I
downloaded that as a PDF and it's a
little bit difficult to read but this
basically just lists all of the memory
kits that gigabyte has directly tested
with this motherboard and verified to
work because you want faster memory with
Rison it improves the performance of the
CPU and since you're usually an
integrated GPU you want decently fast
memory for that as well so all I really
did here was I skip to 3200 mega Hertz
speed memory that's all a little bit
more expensive ddr4 3000 is a good kit
to run with over here you can tell you
that they verified that the XMP settings
have been plugged in and worked so all
you want to do is highlight the actual
SKU the model part number for each one
and depending on your browser whatever
you can just search for Google or
whatever and it should hopefully pull up
a listing for that based on the actual
model number and then maybe you can pull
that up over on Amazon now this is
Amazon Canada for some reason I don't
know why it did that
but the Corsair Vengeance lpx kit is
still a solid kit as long as you get the
right SKU there's also some team options
here so this is the one that I actually
chose and the listing done and the parts
list down below it's an 8 gig kit 2 by 4
gigs and I opted to go with to four gigs
sticks versus a single a gig stick
largely based on the video that Brian
from tech yes city posted earlier today
and he actually compared dual channel
versus single channel mode I'll link
this video in the description as well
but with the 2200 G in dual channel mode
having two sticks of memory versus a
single 8 gig stick was a pretty big
difference in your integrated GPUs
performance so for that reason if you're
going the budget route here get the 2 by
4 gig kits rather than a single 8 gig
kit and that will make sure that you get
the most out of the memory that you
choose and the most out of your eye GPU
now of course that list goes on and if
you should have chosen a different
motherboard you might have a different
list if you go with ASUS motherboard for
example they usually have a lot of
different types of memory listed there
but you can go down that list and just
find the memory that's you know matches
your build if that's what you're looking
for or just has the best price or the
best kind of combination of price and
performance and you can get a 16 gig kit
to buy 8 gigs which is a nice step up a
data has their xpg gamax d-10 kit which
is compatible and there's a few
different varieties of that ddr4 3000
speeds so that's another option there a
Teta also has xbg spectryx d40 which is
on the list and that's that's RGB that's
got RGB lighting on it if you're into
that and that's 190 dollars so we do
have some options again all of this ddr4
memory is still really overpriced if you
compare it to about a year ago hopefully
that will continue to come down but
whereas with this build you can get by
without it graphics card you do still
need system memory other than that
though I've got the SanDisk 240 gig SSD
for 70 bucks and then for the case
actually went over to Fry's because I
didn't have a mini ITX case on hand here
that I could just build in and
Thermaltake core v1 here it was 50 bucks
and also like the only mini ITX case
that they had on hand there Fry's so
that's what I went with there and that
is my build for about $470 right now you
can actually get yourself a nice entry
level gaming PC and the beautiful thing
about this is that if graphics card
prices do come down you can drop a
graphics card in here it's got a full
PCI Express x16 slot and a decent amount
of space in there for most reasonably
sized graphics cards too so you've got
an upgrade path available for you not to
mention that the CPU could be upgraded
too if you switch to a discreet graphics
card you could go with like an 1800 X or
something like that in the future then
