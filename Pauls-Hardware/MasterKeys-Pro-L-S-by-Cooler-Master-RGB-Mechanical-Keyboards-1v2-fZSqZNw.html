is probably why some people are just so
damn particular about theirs we've gone
from the $15 rubber dome keyboard days
10 plus years ago to the landscape we
have now with a dizzying array of
mechanical switch keyboards the promise
increased durability slightly faster
actuation time and a range of
color-coded click enos options that
segments everyone's preferences even
further most will agree though that
cherry makes the best mass-produced
traditional mechanical switches and the
well expensive typing away on a full
mechanical keyboard with your switches
of choice I happen to like browns is a
deeply satisfying feeling today we're
going to take a look at two brand-new
keyboards from cooler master this is the
master keys Pro L and s combining the
long-awaited features of a cooler master
design keyboard genuine Cherry MX
switches and the near-infinite
customizability of perky RGB
backlighting so these boards are both
pretty similar apart from their size the
pro S &amp;amp; L means small and large as far
as I can tell with the s being 10
keyless and the L being full-sized
packaging is very well done in each
board comes with a manual a nice little
key cat puller and a braided 1.5 meter
micro USB to USB type a cable I can't
say I'm loving the decision to stick
with micro USB here on the keyboard side
though it's just not as sturdy of a
connector but the pro s does get an
angled plug to keep it from sticking out
too much and the pro L has under board
cable routing channels so you can make
that cable come out either in the middle
or on the left or the right side the
keyboards themselves are simple and
straightforward design wise in the best
sort of way Coolermaster gets a ton of
credit for this already and rightfully
so and that the boards don't seem to
have more Flair than they need they are
simple rectangles built around the keys
with subtly rounded edges a nice finish
on the housing and the weight and build
quality of a freaking tank the weight of
these boards is an indication of
Coolermaster continuing to do keyboards
write much as I did with the quick-fire
series it's got a metal internal frame
and a very solid feeling sitting on the
desk as you type actually the housing
appears to be the exact same design that
they use for the quick fire rapid rapid
eye at least for the master keys s here
so fans of the rapid I can now get it
an RGB trim so let's talk features
before I dive into an LED lighting demo
starting with the RGB LEDs themselves of
course which like all RGB LEDs that I've
seen advertised can do sixteen point
seven million colors I was not able to
independently verify this color range as
I do not have a spectrophotometer also
now I have looked up and found out what
a spectrophotometer is let's just say I
was not unsatisfied with the variety of
color combinations or brightness options
available and I think you will be able
to get it to represent any color you're
damn well pleased with the possible
exception of pure white all RGB LED
solutions I have seen have trouble
recreating pure white with a slight
bluish tint that's perceptible and
mostly only noticeable if you compare it
to a pure white LED side-by-side as for
switch options though I have cherry MX
reds and browns both represented here
and I'm told the cooler master will have
MX blue versions available in the future
as well the boards feature 100%
anti-ghosting with n key rollover and
you don't even have to use a switch to
go between six key or n key rollover
modes as the board will automatically
detect when you press more than six keys
at once and switch on the fly for you
this function as well as the robust
on-the-fly programming capabilities for
the RGB LEDs are handled by the embedded
72 megahertz arm cortex-m 3 processor
which Coolermaster says is 25% faster
than that stupid old cortex m0 that they
used to use the key caps themselves have
a UV coating to keep them looking new
and shiny as long as possible and the
text on most of the key caps is up at
the top so that the RGB LEDs behind them
can shine through the function keys and
number keys along the top row do have an
upper and lower character on each key
cap so the lower character is noticeably
dimmer due to the proximity of the RGB
LEDs the LEDs themselves though are
bigger than other Cherry MX RGB LED
switches because Coolermaster redesigned
to the housing around each switch to
provide more space for the three LED
array that goes beneath each one I
compared this to the single LED solution
on my quick fire rapid eye and the area
of illumination is definitely much
larger on the pro LM Pro s this combined
with cooler masters continued use of a
white base board beneath the keys makes
those colors really pop
it's not just the keycap characters that
are lit up but you also get sort of a
nice aura lighting effect beneath all
the keys and everything pretty cool
rounding out functions and transitioning
to that LED lighting demo the top row of
function keys gives you on-the-fly
access to RGB lighting you also get 10
levels of brightness to cycle through
for each one the mode button next to
that switches between color wave
breathing and different typing effects
that are available f5 to f8 can help you
adjust your repeat rate which you didn't
even know you needed until now f9 lets
you lock your windows key which is super
helpful if you're going to be doing some
PC gaming f10 engages LED programming
mode f11 and f12 are for recording and
deleting macros and then to the right of
those are function keys for toggling
synchro macros macro on/off or macro
looping function plus escape if you hit
those together will dis quickly disable
all the macros on the keyboard so if you
need to get some work done they won't be
a distraction for you and then there's
also a grouping of 6 media control keys
right below those finally on the top
right of the pro lr4 profile keys so you
can save and switch between four
profiles on the pro s those four profile
keys are and the number keys one through
four finally if you hold down the
function key you'll get a little bit of
a flash that shows you really quickly
which profile you're currently using and
once you're in LED mode you can use
these LED switch buttons tapping them
each to cycle through each brightness
level so 0 through 9 basically goes
brighter and brighter and brighter and
then resets you can even tap them
individually to sort of combine
different brightness levels of red green
and blue to get yourself orange or
purple or yellow for example there's a
bit of a learning curve to this
on-the-fly recording but once you kind
of figure it out it is a very robust
means of controlling RGB lighting
without needing any software you
probably will want to try out the cooler
master software though as it is a little
bit more user-friendly so let's take a
look at that next so I don't have the
cooler master software loaded up it
installed fairly quickly it was able to
recognize my attached master keys
keyboard and it quickly updated the
firmware as well which is also nice to
have so on the bottom what you're
looking at here is the actual keyboard
and on the top is a software I have
compressed it down a little bit so you
can see everything but as you can see
there's two main tabs up at the top we
got le
and we got library so um library is just
a library of profiles so if you create a
profile and you really like it you can
just hit over to there and you can save
it can even import or export them so you
can save them to a file or something
like that over the led side is where we
can actually manipulate stuff so
obviously at the bottom you got four
profiles I I'm just gonna be working
with profile one and then we have the
whole keyboard up here if you mouse over
any of the keys it will give you an RGB
indicator of what color it's currently
set to and then LED mode down here we
have different options so right now it's
on static all white of course we have
the color wave option which I've been
using a lot during the course of this
demonstration cross mode just is a
reactive typing mode so as you hit a key
it will give you I'll give me a little
error first because doesn't like what
I'm pushing but gives you the cross mode
across all the keys which is kind of
cool single key is just a single key
reactive typing so it'll light up each
key as you type it great for letting
people know what your password is so in
the customize area you can of course
customize you can choose any color you
want from the color grid over here the
slider you can just indicate RGB values
and this is kind of fun because you can
either indicate individual keys that you
want to change color and they should
light up as you click them or if you
want to be super fancy you can click and
drag and you can get like whole banks of
colors all at the same time so what you
want to do I'm gonna I'm gonna do like a
but what country's flag is this I have
no idea it's probably some country's
flag look there it's beautiful okay
moving on we have a star effect that we
can enable which will do like a field of
stars it's just kind of a an effect
that'll be there all the time even while
you're not typing we have raindrop
effect which will rain rain drops down
oh it's coming down rains coming down
pretty hard right now that's kind of
nice too
color cycle will just automatically
cycle between a bunch of different
colors very slowly as you can see and
you can adjust the speed with which it
does that over here so faster or slower
of course and then of course we have
breathes which will just breathe on and
off super nice ripple effects which will
do an outward Ripple wherever you type
which is also one of those kind of cool
typing effects that you can do and then
multi layer which I haven't quite
figured out this
appears to allow you to integrate
multiple effects with a single setting
so I was able to set all these up you
can click on this and then change it
over here I'm guessing this will allow
you to quickly cycle between the
different modes if you put a multi layer
on you just do your favorite modes in
there you have the snake game which is
super fun so here I'm actually going to
use the the keyboard up and down arrows
to play snake you can see the snake has
a red head and you're trying to go after
the green apples once you eat the green
apples and they reappear and then the
more you eat the longer the snake gets
you guys have played this game right you
guys have Nokia phones
I imagine this game you could play even
without it being connected to a computer
if you just had like USB power so you
know bring this to an airport and then
you have loads of fun just playing snake
anyway end of that
okay system status is kind of fun this
will give you a visual representation of
your cpu load I'm using about 10 to 30%
so it's giving me all numbers down here
at the bottom if I put a full load on it
you get more indicators of stuff
higher up it's kind of fun and then
finally we have oh wait no for system
status we also have equalizer so you can
combine this with like music playing
which I can maybe do over here really
quick yeah so now I got some music
playing all of you guys probably can't
hear it but yeah now as the music plays
you get a little equalizer effect that
goes on the keyboard too and then of
course lastly we have off if you just if
you hate your RGB LEDs turn them off so
overall I think Coolermaster has given
fans exactly what they wanted with the
master keys Pro series you've got 10
keyless and full-size options available
they both use genuine Cherry MX keys and
they have a design that's clean and I'll
Eliot's with very solid build quality
which is what coolermaster is really
known for I like the option to control
the RGB LEDs via software or use the
on-the-fly built-in control options and
I think color master has the right
switch options available at launch with
MX browns right out of the gates reds
and blues also coming soon my complaints
would start with the micro USB plug as a
type-c connector I think would have been
a better choice here the pricing is also
a little tough to swallow with the pro L
costing 170 US dollars and the pro s
coming at 140 this isn't too far out of
line with other Cherry MX RGB keyboards
in this class but it is a premium
price points finally if there was a
feature I could add it would be a USB
pass-through that is a feature that I
have just found infinitely useful in
keyboards that have it in fact that is
how this keyboard is plugged in right
now via that keyboard over there anyway
the master keys Pro L should be
available right now and I will link this
one down in the video description I'm
also told the master keys Pro S will be
available in three to four weeks so if
you're a 10 kilos fan you do have to
wait just a little bit longer and again
brown switches available right now with
reds and blues still to come that's all
for this review though thank you guys so
much for watching and if you enjoyed it
don't forget to softly caress that like
button with a gentle mouse click if you
want to support me you can use my amazon
