a vlog II style video but might be
interesting even for those of you who
aren't really into the vlogs I will
explain why I've had quite a few people
ask me what my day-to-day is like now
that I'm not working full-time anymore
and here's at least part of it I'm just
eating some breakfast yay oatmeal coffee
check it out the channel answering some
emails and today's video though I want
to get some stuff done and the stuff I
want to get done is not necessarily
creating videos which is I'm going with
the vlog so I can kind of show you guys
something of what I'm doing today fix up
a couple things that I've been meaning
to get set up that I haven't yet and
they're kind of necessary for me to
continue my video production or improve
the way I do video production alright so
here's my camera this is a Canon EOS use
5d mark ii really like the camera it's
not the mark 3 but it's got a nice full
frame sensor and everything of course
we've got green hills of Africa a little
Hemingway gonna kind of get the morning
start off right it does not have a
flip-out LCD screen which means that
when I'm when I'm recording myself I
need to set something in front of the
camera so I can focus on it it's just
that's a little awkward so I'm going to
be using something that I believe Jay
originally introduced to Jerry and
that's the the DSLR software that you
can put on the tablet so getting that
set up so I can monitor from the camera
will be very very helpful for me and
sorry about the glare guys but the
second thing is here I want to set up a
teleprompter for myself though I've done
this over at Newegg I made a really
ghetto one there I'm gonna make another
super ghetto in here probably just gonna
be using cardboard for the time being
but that's really gonna help me make my
productions go a bit quicker and also
it's going to help me a lot on the
editing site because with a prompter to
Kenna cue me going from point to point
it's gonna be a lot easier to stay on
task and all that kind of stuff so if I
get those done then I'm moving on to my
next to big actual video projects one is
a some actual hands-on testing a direct
review video of the HT to 20x and I've
also got a new an tech power supply here
edge 650 so want to do some quick
testing with that as well I've
discovered I don't have all the parts I
need for today's project so I'm doing it
Road Trip of cope with a great excuse
for why I'm so unshaven and unkempt
today it's a masterfully executed
disguise I'm going undercover normally I
don't get recognized in public but it is
always a joy and I do when I do so you
guys it's about me anywhere say hello
but that's because I'm going here today
not that I'm worried about anyone
spotting me in here as far as customers
go I just don't want security jumping in
and trying to tackle me or something
because they think I'm here to sabotage
the place oh my god there are so many
things it's alright the success for item
one that I'm looking for that's this USB
on-the-go adapter Oh Fry's impulse
bisection run run get through it as
quickly as you can so my trip was fairly
successful you guys already saw that
that's what I came here to get the USB
on-the-go adapter I also grabbed a
wireless USB adapter because it's always
nice to be able to have one of those
available just to plug in and connect
wirelessly especially if I'm setting up
a test bed or something
this was my impulse-buy item that I got
look at that open box only thirty bucks
for the wireless Xbox 360 remote or
wireless controller that's in the box
upside down but I checked it mainly I
got this actually for the little adapter
it comes with the USB adapter this is
going to go for the new HTPC wireless
controller for the living room perfect
so I have returned home now and I've got
the USB on-the-go adapter plugged in to
the tablets so this is gonna help me
work out a couple issues here first off
that adapter was necessary just to get
the DSLR controller software to work so
I'm gonna be setting that up but also
the DSLR controller software appears to
work best with vanilla Android devices
and my Asus memo pad HD 7 is not that so
next up on the agenda is to route this
but I have a very important thing I need
to do first before I read it and that is
I don't have much saved on this but I do
have an epic plants vs. zombies save
game also there's a little puppy right
here who might want some some playtime
right right now are you gonna go play of
course you do
what do you want to play with gonna play
with what's up here what's up here catch
catch here's the one thing I want to
save on this tablet before I start
rooting around on it that's my plants
vs. zombies to save I mostly play this
when I go on trips and stuff on the
plane I'm on the far future level okay
guys here's another vlog update so I
spent like way too much time trying to
get plants vs. zombies off of this
tablet
I was looking some pretty obscure
methods until I finally realized Oh
plants vs. zombies newest update will
let you just save to the cloud and then
it works now it's on my phone that I'm
using to record this so that's good I
did decide I wanted to get something
done a little bit more productive since
I spent so much time at i/o the next
thing I found out here was that based on
this German website from flagger de the
process of setting this up for the USB
on-the-go to use as the DSLR the DSLR
controller software involves getting a
different type of dis USB on-the-go
cable that includes an additional plug
for power unfortunately those aren't
available quite as readily at a local
source i've ordered one online actual
order - they're gonna come i'm gonna
have to wait so as a result i have put
this project on hold for now as far as
getting a DSLR controller app set up so
that kind of sucks but yeah what can you
do i guess i could also just buy a nexus
7 okay but on to my other project that i
started working on this is like super
super ghetto so um I needed a
teleprompter as I mentioned earlier and
in order to do so I've just taken a
cardboard box and just started hacking
it together with duct tape the other
option here was what Kyle has done
recently which was spend about 150 bucks
for one I think Amazon was worried about
it but I decided to go the cardboard
route for now and I can just connect it
up to my computer I have a
monitor their on the bottom I have a
piece of glass that's the only other
thing here that's not duct tape and
that's basically how it works there's a
hole in the back so I'm going to put the
camera through there and it flips the
script for you and other than that it's
held together by duct tape the other
thing about this is that the whole thing
can just kind of lift off and and I can
set it aside which is OK for NASA this
is like functional I'm happy that this
is functional I'm going to start using
this a little bit I promise my videos
aren't going to start sounding all
scripted and lame and stuff but that's
good it's good that I got something done
next on my to-do list is I want to do a
little bit of testing with the edge so
I'm just going to connect that the antec
edge up to the test fit over here and
just see how it does and that'll be cool
and who knows maybe I'll even get on to
doing some some testing and this guy
today which is if you guys remember this
is where I did all my cpu cooler testing
now we got some more coming up for the
h2 20 X but I think that's to do it for
my vlog video today I need to go and
actually start editing this if I'm
actually going to post it I'd love to
know what you guys think as far as this
video goes I know I was a little random
and shaky Bloggie style but that was the
only way I was going to do any video of
production today and honestly it's been
one of those days where I didn't even
get much done that I planned on anyway
but let me know what you think if you
want to see more videos like this on
days when I couldn't necessarily produce
anything else or if you'd rather to see
the more produced stuff that I shoot
with DSLR that's a little bit cleaner
and isn't shaking around all the time
but thank you guys for watching if the
hit the like button don't forget to
subscribe we'll see you all there soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
