comes to building a pc on a budget let's
say the 400 to $700 range I find there
to be a very common theme that is that
folks will go pick all their core
components out CPU motherboard memory
graphics card and then they'll be left
with like $50 for a case and a power
supply and if you watch my show you
probably know that I never ever advocate
skimping on the power supply what about
the case you can actually get away
without a case entirely if that's your
thing but you'll find that most people
actually do use cases they provide some
protection they provide some airflow and
they provide a nice aesthetic for your
build overall but for today I'm going to
be taking a look at this cooler master
Silencio 350 - a case that promises to
hit a nice mid range between those more
expensive
$8,200 cases and the entry-level
bare-bones and hideous all grey bare
metal cases that will cost you maybe 30
or 40 bucks
the model number we're looking at is si
l - 350 - M - k kn1 it's finished into
midnight black and it's made of polymer
plastic as well as steel the dimensions
are 200 by 378 by 453 millimeters or 7.8
by 14.9 by 17 point 8 inches it weighs
about 10 pounds or 10.3 total four point
seven kilograms and it will support mini
ITX
as well as micro ATX motherboards bear
in mind you can't fit full sized ATX in
here it is a smaller case but again if
you're building on a budget that might
be a feature for you as these smaller
size motherboards can often be less
expensive for drive support you have a
five and a quarter inch drive bay up at
the top so you can fit an optical drive
in there or perhaps a fan controller or
an additional card reader you have three
3.5 inch phase-two by way of the cage at
the bottom which you can remove
completely via the screws if you don't
need it you also have an additional 3.5
inch mount just below the optical drive
bays and then you can fit for 2.5 inch
drives in this case along with the three
3.5 inch drives they've cleverly hidden
them throughout the case the front of
the case I've kind of glossed over up to
this
but it does have a nice matte finish
with the Coolermaster logo towards the
bottom the door swings open from right
to left and it's not reversible this
could be an issue if you're right-handed
user actually Jay pointed this out in
his video of this since it's a smaller
door I don't think it's going to be a
huge issue but there is noise dampening
foam on the inside so that's going to
prevent a lot of the noise from within
the case from escaping directly off the
front which is the most common means of
noise pollution with a typical ATX tower
build at the top you have your exposed
five and a quarter inch Bay another
exposed 3.5 inch bay down below that and
then a easily removable fan filter here
for your to 120 front intake fans again
one of these is already populated with a
hundred and twenty millimeter fan and
you have room to add a second one if
possible you can also fit a 240
millimeter radiator up here however in a
case of this price I would hesitate to
say yeah sure go ahead and drop another
hundred bucks on a 240 millimeter
all-in-one solution I might consider
spending more on the case maybe jump up
to the cooler master Silencio three six
fifty two and that might be a better
option nevertheless it is there if you
want to take advantage of it or upgrade
it in the future
you could also fit a hundred and twenty
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooling
solution on the rear exhaust not the top
mind you there's not quite enough space
up there but that would be a bit more
viable option if you're looking to go
for a liquid cooling solution in this
case an additional hundred and twenty or
one hundred and forty millimeter exhaust
at the top of the case this one is also
also filtered it is a plastic filter
that you need to remove from the inside
so it's not quite as easy to get at
however it is filtered so that's
something and it comes with a plastic
magnetic panel that you can add on top
of that if you don't plan to use this as
an exhaust and again that will help help
kill some of the noise that might be
emanating from inside the case the i/o
panel on the front has two USB 3.0 ports
and that's a great reason to get a case
like this in a newer cases to have
support for the newer standard you also
have a single USB 2.0 port and that USB
2.0 port also shares a data connection
with the SD card reader again very nice
to have in here it's USB 2.0 only but
very convenient finally you have an
audio i/o so mic and headphone jack
located there as well above all of that
you have a power and reset button with
corresponding LEDs expansion slots at
the back are four that's again pretty
standard for a micro ATX chassis and
then for cooling you have a couple
hundred and twenty millimeter fans that
are included and these are not any
ordinary fans these are cooler masters
extra flow 120 and the connectors are
either molex or a three pin fan header
you can plug straight into your
motherboard and then use voltage control
in order to reduce the RPMs if you want
the power supply mount is down at the
bottom it supports full sized ATX power
supplies it has four rubber feet at the
bottom for some noise dampening as well
as a removable fan filter for the power
supply intake you might also have
noticed that the entire interior of this
case is all painted black and this is
something that you often don't get if
you're looking at budget cases it's a
nice touch by Coolermaster they do a
really good job with their paint and it
helps keep everything looking clean and
much higher quality internally overall
if I have a complaint about the interior
it's going to be the cable management
there's essentially no space behind the
motherboard tray at all if you wanna
route cables there there's a bit of a
gap at the lower side of the case so you
can get your cables over to your drive
bays for example however additional
cable management is pretty much
non-existent so you're going to need to
be bundling up your cables and keeping
them inside the case which is a good
reason possibly to get a modular power
supply if you want to keep things a bit
cleaner it's not the end of the world of
course but it is a limitation and
something you might want to consider
aesthetically cooler master has done a
great job here as well for the silencio
352 they have kind of a glossy band
around the front of the case that's kind
of a carryover from their end series
that they have transitioned over to the
silencio series and they've made them a
bit more silenced optimized apart from
that though it's got a nice finish it's
got a matte finish on the door which is
a pretty fingerprint resistant as well
it's a good job on the looks of this
case cooler master and then one more
little aesthetic detail that I like is
that cooler master has sleeved all of
the internal cables with black cable
sleeving which again keeps everything
looking nice and clean so let's wrap up
this little video with some conclusions
shall we about the silencio 352 I really
like this little case in the short time
I spent with it I noticed several things
that really stood out to me
one would be the fit and finish overall
Coolermaster always does a great job
with that
and coming at at a slightly more budget
level I was happy to see that this case
all comes together very nicely the paint
job is excellent Coolermaster also does
a fantastic job with that and this is
another thing that we are seeing trickle
down a little bit more but not always on
the mid or lower end cases I also like
the drive support in this case not only
do you have three 3.5 inch mounts but
you also have four additional 2.5 inch
mounts and they're in different places
you don't use up your 2.5 inch mounts by
installing a 3.5 inch drive so you can
actually fit seven drives in this case
over all at the same time other nice
features are the card reader which is
very nice to have the fact that all of
the fan intakes are filtered which I
almost demand on any case that I'm
actually going to build a system in the
fact that there's noise dampening
included is another thing that's great
at this price point on the con side I do
have to complain about the complete lack
of cable management behind the
motherboard tray that's just something
I'm a little used to granted that's
something you can get around but then
the other thing is just something that's
again pretty common on cases at this
price point the steel is still thinner
gauge and although Coolermaster has
added these bowed out sections in the
side panels you can still tell there's a
bit of flex there but once everything's
together it stays together pretty nicely
and it's nice and rigid but that is all
for this video guys thank you for
watching hopefully you've enjoyed this
is have been the coolermaster silencio
352 please let me know what you think
about it in the comments section down

hitting those or dislike hitting those
don't forget to use my amazon link
before you shop at Amazon don't forget
