back once again to Paul's hardware today
I'm bringing you my promised microphone
comparison video and here they are
basically we have the zoom h1 right
there little audio recorder device I got
a little accessory kit for it so it's
rocking a little windscreen right now as
well as a little tripod hold it up
that's nice it also got the blue
snowball which is right here I've also
added a pop filter to it because it was
a little combo deal and you know you
know the combo deals work you just Add
to Cart Add to Cart
so that's set up right here that's
plugged in the laptop I'm going to be
recording Adobe Audition with it to get
to get my sound there zoom h1 is
self-contained so that's just going to
be recording under there at the end I'm
going to be compiling all this and I'll
put it together without any like
compression or equalization effects or
anything like that so you guys get
pretty much as raw the audio as I can
handle I'm not an audio technician by
any stretch of the imagination so this
is really going to be kind of a homebrew
test I'm just kind of plugging these in
and using them with just a few tips that
I've read from the manuals that's just
about it so in case you're wondering
what you're hearing right now that's
been the mic that I've been using for my
videos for quite some time which is
located over there it's a road video mic
Pro so I guess this is also an audio
test comparison for that one as well
although I'm not going to be doing all
the other stuff what I'm going to be
doing is reading some dramatic I
honestly don't know what I'm going to
read I'm gonna look up something and
read it off for you guys and also I'm
going to be playing guitar for you which
I'm not all that good at but if you guys
are into music production maybe you're
also looking for mics and maybe that
will help too but I've talked enough so
let's go ahead and get right to it here
is your audio test demonstration
for very long time almost three seconds
jane could not understand what had
happened to her everything functioned of
course the satellite-based ground link
computer reported a since cessation of
transmissions with an orderly step-down
which clearly implied that ender had
switched off the interface in a normal
manner it was routine on worlds where
computer interface implants were common
switch on and switch off happened
millions of times an hour
you
in my dream it was very dark and what
dim light there was seemed to be
radiating from Edwards skin I couldn't
see his face just his back as he walked
away from me leaving me in the blackness
no matter how fast I ran I couldn't
catch up to him no matter how loud I
called he never turned troubled I woke
in the middle of the night and couldn't
sleep again for what seemed like a very
long time
pity this busy monster man unkind not
progress is a comfortable disease your
victim death and life safely beyond
plays with the bigness of his littleness
electrons dfi one razor blade into a
mountain range
I don't know what else could air cordons
how about Logan let's current Logan
here comes Logan bringing you the trucks
and that is gonna do it for this video
or at least for my audio tests and
honestly at this point I've only
recorded everything I have not gone back
and edited or listened back or anything
like that so I have no idea what the
results of the tests are you guys
probably know better than me at this
point but what I would really like is
your opinions also if you guys have any
suggestions for me I don't know if any
of the guys who watch my channel guys or
girls - some girls do like 3% who
watched my channel are into audio
production but if you guys have any tips
for me I'd love to hear them I'm always
looking for ways to improve my
production quality if I can I know audio
is often kind of lower on the list for a
lot of people but I want everything to
sound good and hopefully look good too
anyway but yeah that's all for this
video leave me your comments down in the
description below all I have to go off
right now is usability and usability
wise I'd say I like the zoom h1 a little
bit better because you can just take
this anywhere you want to go and that's
pretty cool and it's got line in and
everything so you can plug in other mics
the blue eye I have my preconception is
that the blue snowball is probably gonna
have a little bit better audio quality
perhaps who knows but you do have the
requirement that it's USB mic so you
have to plug it into a laptop or a
desktop or something like that in order
to get it to work so but those are my
preconceptions thus far I'm actually
gonna go and do some editing on this
video now and hear how it sounds and
everything but as far as you guys out
there if you're watching this video and
you're not subscribed to my channel
please do so you'll find more tech
videos mostly about computer hardware
but lots of other stuff long as I as I
continue video production as well also
like the video if you did enjoy it or if
you found it useful because that really
helps and yeah thanks for watching we'll
see you guys in the next video
means we kept juice</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
