that giveaways still open I think until
Sunday this week so I feel free to go
ahead that beautiful that's all for our
our announcements we are going to move
into the first segment net watch and
we're gonna talk briefly about net
neutrality I've talked a lot about net
neutrality because it's very important
I'm gonna try to go through these really
quickly though because I know some
people just heard about a lot they've
already heard they know what it is and
everything
to move on but there's a few ongoing
developments for it so I wanted to hit
on them real quick and of course the big
thing actually the biggest thing is that
net neutrality FCC is probably probably
going to be repealing the net neutrality
rules in two days on December 14th
that's what everyone's expecting because
that's what they keep saying they're
gonna do despite most people or at least
the vast majority of people from what we
can tell not wanting it to happen
including a bunch of tech luminaries
including of course the wasps right
there Wow it's just much of people who
have who either operate currently or
were very instrumental in the
developments of the internet or other
areas of technology and I'm gonna
apologize if I pronounced mispronounced
any of these names but Steve Belvin is
the former FTC chief technologist to
help develop Usenet Tim berners-lee is
the inventor of the world wide web
Vinton Cerf who co-created the
Internet's tcpip protocol Steve Crocker
helped develop the protocols for
internet prepare for the ARPANET Stephen
wolf who helped transform the military
ARPANET into a civilian research and
communications network Apple co-founder
Steve Wozniak of course Mozilla founder
an executive chair woman Mitchell Baker
Internet Archive founder Brewster Kahle
and beta works CEO John Borthwick all
have sort of put in their their feelings
about this and they all feel that's this
net neutrality vote that's about to
happen is an imminent threat to the
Internet as we know it so that's why a
lot of people are in up in arms a G PI
is the currents chairperson of the FCC
he's kind of been spearheading this
whole thing that they're doing right now
that a lot of people are kind of upset
about and he keeps seeing he keeps
bringing up stuff that isn't necessarily
true and that's often demonstrably false
hmm it seems out of character for him
yeah and most recently was his supposed
phone calls that he had and we're not
saying that the phone calls are false
but I need you to press release about
five small ISPs that he says we're
harmed by the rules and that's the the
stance that trying to take is that the
net neutrality protections that were
introduced in 2015 are harming people
are harming a small is Pisa
but there's no data offered to support
it so the advocacy group Free Press
looked the FCC's broadband deployment
data for these companies found that four
of them had expanded into new territory
and then the fifth didn't expand into
new areas but it didn't start offering
gigabit internet service and all this
happened in the past two years during
title 2 tech net neutrality rules so
just seems very disingenuous and false
which is just continuing I guess par for
the course for G pi because he seems to
be encouraged doing a lot of misleading
of people there is a congressman who's
doing a last-ditch effort to save net
neutrality
his name is Sean Patrick Maloney he's a
Democrat House of Representatives rep
from New York he's introduced the save
net neutrality Act HR four five eight
five and the house to the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce he did
this just in the past week unfortunately
this is largely a symbolic gesture and
because although this would be
congressional action to prevent the FCC
from doing what it's about to do it
would have to somehow get on the floor
for a vote tomorrow which it bites
according to the article there might be
a vote in the house tomorrow evening
then we have to also pass the Senate and
have Trump sign it all before the vote
on Thursday which is not very likely at
all each but anyway some people are
trying to do what they can to prevent
this from happening if you'd like to do
what you can you can go to battle for
the Netcom I can enter your information
there and you call can contact your
representatives and let just let them
know how you feel about the open
Internet and mayorality
we feel it should be protected you can
also go and sign the petition at
whitehouse.gov/champions about two
hundred fifty thousand signatures
already reached the goal but feel free
to add your seat to that as well okay I
hope that was a quick rundown of
nationality stuff oh one last thing if
you want even more on that I did a in
depth net neutrality video with Windle
just this past week and it's just a few
videos back on my channel so thanks to
you guys who have been speaking out
about that because we like the Internet
we think it's best that the internet be
open for everyone to use and we would
prefer that the
Internet service providers who were
forced to sign up with especially those
of us who don't have more than one
choice for one would prefer that they're
not able to to kind of choose what we
have easier access to and not yeah all
right early on and we're just gonna jump
straight into news I have a bunch of
sort of random news so it's all just
been grouped together in one in one big
blob sweet cool with me I'm abandoning
abandoning our segments all structure is
falling falling out the window well cool
then what do we got up first
something about hacking I guess I could
call it mini segments mini Singh each
article is a segment so nice nice hash
last week it turns out apparently has
been hacked this was actually on
Wednesday which is a Bitcoin mine last
week we've talked about about nice nice
hash before it's it's it's a sort of a
marketplace it's it puts people who have
mining power together with people who
want to pay money for that mining power
so gotcha you put your system on nice
hash and then the software chooses what
cryptocurrency your system mines based
on the marketplace that they developed
nice late Wednesday night last week
appears well it depends on what time
zone you're in I guess but attackers
access the company systems at 118 CET
that's a little past midnight GMT by a
few hours later they the hackers who the
company believes were based outside the
European Union had begun stealing
Bitcoin and in fact stole all the
Bitcoin what from nice and all nice hash
from Bitcoin gone 4,700 bitcoins to be
specific which is quite a lot that
special if you consider the current
what's that like it's over 10,000 now
right
you haven't been Cuban an addict why
it's like a 20,000 huh I don't know what
piqued a bit was I know
I remember hearing 18 I don't keep up
with it much because I don't mind it and
I don't want to be tempted to mine
grating it continue going up right now
according to google it is 17 749 so yeah
almost about a Tina
which would mean holy crap it's
definitely over 9000 that's for sure so
what does that matter it's that now
supporting seven forty seven hundred
eighty seven hundred Bitcoin is at least
right now is eighty three million
dollars oh my god for two million
dollars I mean we had to have seen this
coming
with a digital currency right and just
how this is not this is not I mean
there's there there have been
cryptocurrency related websites and
services that have been hacked before
this is definitely not the first time
what happened oh yeah in fact this has
to be one of the is this the biggest
heist
it's like crypto money like eighty five
million
I can't say that for sure just off the
top of my head but it's also one of
those things that is it's relative to
the price right now the price has gone
so up so fast
yeah that um you know it can make things
sound more impressive because you can
see that goes 83 million dollars or
whatever like that yeah I mean at the
time of the writing of this article they
said eighty million dollars worth so but
yeah that sucks for anyone who was using
nice hash and who had a balance there
there are reports that nice hash users
will be reimbursed and mr. COBOL Marco
COBOL who is the chief executive at
NIOSH has after a bit of sort of freaked
out silence when things started appears
to have gone wrong has spoken out about
it there is an article on tweak town
which I didn't want to load up on your
computer because I don't want tweak
town's website using your system to do
cryptocurrency mining please because I'm
sorry but that's what they're doing
I know every time I go to tweet town oh
yeah yeah the fans spin up and
everything like that
and you know that's really you know
they're all about cryptid it's actually
really shitty so anyway but tweak town
has an article that says nice hash is
supposed to be is it there it says
they're gonna reimburse everyone who
knows if that's actually going to happen
or not but the article I linked us from
BBC and at the end of the article there
are other recent controversies involving
digital currency including the firm
behind digital currency tether who said
it close to 31 millions worth worth of
its tokens was stolen the code bug in
aetherium digital wallets blamed last
month for freezing more than 150 million
dollars worth of cerium you're either
South Korean exchange bit hum says that
one of its employees pcs had been hacked
in June several customers reported
follow-up scam calls and stuff anyway
Association download anti minor
extension to stop mining on your rig
okay sure that was bound to happen and
I'm glad someone's working on a solution
for that for web sites that are choosing
to do that it's a called anti minor anti
minor I bet it's just a program that
actually mines your computer it'd be
nice it'd be nice if like this also
seems like something like pro like the
Chrome and Firefox should implement it's
just block like a nice accident doesn't
does that seem like a legitimate use of
adblock mind block right next to adblock
you'll have 9 block everyone go download
that fictional extension you're just
good all up site and you get all the
popups a sec hey we have cookies and you
know we're gonna spy on you
let us know your location give us access
to mine on your system and no how about
no sign up and sign up for our
newsletter that's just ridiculous
yeah alright so I do that I get involved
I know since these are kind of mini
segments and I really mini segments and
I'm making this up as I go along
I didn't make a straw poll so we can do
a brief ask the audience here Kyle even
though
it's not technically a segment yep but
we're gonna do a quick ask the audience
and if you guys want to vote in our
quick straw poll I'm kind of curious how
many of you guys are actually involved
in this little Bitcoin thing so how many
guys have the bitcoins the question is
do you have Bitcoin just waiting to be
stolen no not at all
less than 1 1 to 10 10 to 100 100 plus
or maybe you don't have a Bitcoin but
you've got some other cryptocurrency
going on so I think that should cover
just about everybody but we'll come back
to this in just a minute and Kyle and I
will guess what you guys what your
answers are it's gonna be epic
1 million let's move on NVIDIA just this
past week announced and immediately
launched was like the announcements
launch mints immediately both things and
I believe even Titan Bolton Titan B
we're gonna be the views for Volta Moo
and a few people have gotten their hands
on it so far it doesn't seem as far as I
can tell like Nvidia really did any
sampling of this because I believe gave
yours Nexus either bought this no or
isn't anybody got that they get on
Twitter with some bits be trippin yes
too low still all right well Paul does
that I just copy it from here yeah I
just copied it from there so that's got
to be just steal our beer gifted to us
by our friend John John was like you
guys have this beer but it's only for
you not for headache
I specifically remember we can't really
say that because Heather was also
further
there's a strawpoll again it definitely
works I just loaded up good so uh makes
my wife you sauce everyone why the delay
is weird okay
so what was I talking about Titan the
Titan V boot yes Titan V it's pretty
crazy it's $3,000 boobs is how much they
are charging for it and I believe gamers
Nexus has the most like actual hands-on
coverage with this so far I think
they're trolling yeah
there's actual white vsauce guys do not
troll the wife anyway they test the 3d
mark times 30 mark times but on its they
also did a little bit of overclocking
you can see some of the charts here the
only thing that was kind of hanging
anywhere close to it in some situations
was vegas vegas 64 in crossfire
situations and then they were looking a
little bit more specifically at some of
the underlying graphics tests not just
overall score and stuff like that and if
you guys want a bit more depth so if you
haven't already watched it check out
Steve's video where he does a much
better job of explaining all this stuff
now the Titan okay I'm really hoping
that was just an isolated incident and
is that one sorry no I mean I've never
seen I've never seen you actually come
down with that it happens very rarely
comedy does happen patting your beer I
don't know I took like a small sip of
Heather's beer and I suddenly got a
hiccup and hopefully it goes away
okay yeah the link doesn't work I don't
know what to tell you guys go to strop
doesn't I took a quick I just looked at
the results in the results are there so
they're getting in people yeah one four
six zero nine five four six justjust go
type that in the shuffle yeah
anyway specs are pretty crazy it's got
12 gigs of HP m2 memory 21 point 1
billion transistors
on the GV 100 GPU and it's got 5,000 120
CUDA cores 640 tensor cores the tensor
cores are for deep learning and AI
specifically so that's what this card is
all about it is it is a workstation card
it can do some gaming and Steve's
benchmarking was there trying to start
to tease out what Volta is capable of
because of also of course the darker
texture will be implemented in other
GPUs mainstream GPS it will all be able
to get our hands on hopefully for less
than $3,000 so there's definitely some
interesting stuff to look at even though
this card isn't necessarily practical
for most people what was it what was it
like 20 to 25 percent faster than a
1080i is what I was saying if you're
looking strictly at the gaming
performance gaming if you look if you
look at it like scaling the like
teraflops how many I forget what the
teraflop number was it has like 11 pair
of lobster yeah 10 11 something like
that if you look at that and you look at
the price of like a Titan XP it kind of
scales like it's almost like you can be
like well I guess that's why they
charged $3,000 for it right so you know
there's some if if if you want to take
the stance of an Nvidia marketing or
sales rep and as far as why they think
it's worth $3,000 there is some argument
to be made there sure I guess is what is
what we're saying they also did some
doom
did you overclock megahertz offset and
the first page of the article they they
did the chart where they do their
overclock stepping so they start with
the GPU and they crank the clop speed up
a little bit at a time and eventually
they start to hit artifacts or driver
crash or whatever so and that they were
able to get up to upper 1700s a little
1800s and then they moved over to the
memory crank that up from it starts at
850 megahertz they were able to get it
up to about thousand 26 I believe before
they started doing some artifacts but
the doesn't seem like they were able to
top off the GPU overclock so they're
heading around 1927 Peak 1830
he looks like 1875 1830s so mid 1800s as
far as actual average court clock so you
know a decent amount of overclocking
capability and even a nice little little
bump on the hpm to memory there as well
nice and it did also show some
performance gains as well
1.7 gigabits per second HP on to memory
3072 bit bus the bandwidth on the HBM
memory is just insane 653 gigabytes per
second and then card overall has a
Turner 50 watt TDP 180 pin in one six
pin power
PCI Express graphics power connector and
again $3,000 I don't know that everyone
got by Ted Bolton it's the that's the
just just take that $3,000 you have
lying around in your house that's spare
3 grand put it to something useful
invest in Volta yeah I'm I'm expecting
at least three of them to arrive extra I
get a shipping thing because I think I
think of video sending me like a you
know Christmas you know I send that
little Christmas Ange thing yeah but
it's like I got the notification Isaac
that's what's in what are these enemy oh
is it is it one of the Star Wars edition
1080 th now it's a Christmas ornament
Christmas or you know would be it maybe
it's like a mini what if it's a mini
Titan V like as an ornament but it like
the shipping it says like the tracking
says like tell like it actually and you
get it exactly just the ornament of I
would be kind of disappoint gonna be a
dick move in video thanks for the
ornament that hey it's very thoughtful
of them to send a nice know it is
Christmas that much more thought alright
timing-wise the volta launch may or may
not have been specifically intended to
squash am DS news for this weekend
who knows but AMD has just launched
Radeon software adrenaline drill n so if
you haven't been following the way AMD
does their their driver updates over the
past three years since ran technologies
group became a thing they do yearly big
updates so we they were using Radian
software crimson for the past year so
we've been using Radeon software
adrenalin is the follow-up to that it is
named after the adrenaline rose random
in case you were wondering didn't even
know there was a rose named adrenaline
Ted bit yeah
there is a full interview with Scott
Watson and mr. branch out over here on
PC percent perspective in the article
actually Scott Watson also came out and
talked to me about this a little bit
although I didn't think I did I did make
a video this video I'm making on it
right now
here you go there's two things that you
may may be most interested as far as new
features that are introduced the Radeon
overlay is one of them so that this is
kind of kind of cool I don't know why
can't I see this image there's the
overlay sort of so it's an on screen
display thing that you can pull up while
you're in game you can use a hotkey
pulls it up allows you to access
graphics card monitoring tools as well
as driver settings without having to
leave the game or do alt tab and you can
see here it's got access to Radian
relive performance monitoring Radeon
chill Radeon frame rate target control
free sync and color which is which is
pretty useful so color adjustments that
you do with this for example can change
the way the game appears to you but if
you're doing screen cap or streaming or
something like that it won't change the
way the game appears to other people so
you can set for instance Dimitri Herbert
connects to the video on this on this to
and to meet you said like if you want to
make it really warm so you get less eye
fatigue for example you can do that but
it's not necessarily gonna affect the
the capture that kind of thing right
also gives you access to just stuff a
little bit easier like reading on chill
which is something that seems like a
cool feature but maybe not something
that lots of people have actually
Chili's been around before but they've
enhanced it and they've added
compatibility with a bunch of new games
which is useful but it's a power saving
feature so if you're playing a game and
the software can tell that there's not a
lot of movement and not a lot of change
and the screen going on during the game
it'll down clock the graphics card we're
able to you know it'll maintain the
framerate and everything but it down
clocks a card actually doesn't maintain
the framerate but you you see no
difference right uses less power yeah
that's the upshot I'm not doing a good
job of describing that no yeah I got you
but a cool feature if you are concerned
about your power usage or even in a
situation like maybe you you know most
graphics cards will now throw the limb
selves a little bit once they start to
get too warm so something like that can
keep your card from getting too warm and
then maybe even get yourself a little
bit of more performance out of it as
well check that out I should check out
some Radeon chill yeseo it does I have
not had any hands-on experience with it
yet yeah you can also do a performance
overlay with it so you can turn on
performance monitoring and show some
in-game metrics and stuff like that so
you can show framerate and GPU usage and
that kind of thing it is limited in the
layout configuration Dimitri said you
couldn't actually move stuff around so
again I kind of gotta go with the layout
that they put but still you know a nice
feature to have something that lots of
people like to use if you want to play
the game but also keep an eye on your
system performance at the same time
there is also an app so that's the
second sort of probably thing that
people might be most interested may or
may not who knows it's called AMD link
it's compatible with iOS as well as
Android I believe and basically gives
you a connection between your smartphone
the app and your computer and access to
the same tools that you would have
access via to via the software
yeah it allows you to monitor control
Radeon software use a QR code to
activate it via a Wi-Fi connection and
Ryan said that the interface is clean
and that they thought it was pretty
decent there isn't much in the way of
performance increases with this launch
this is more of a feature set update
yeah and sort of also you know than them
just continuing to update the overall
capabilities of the Radeon software can
do so
Radeon software adrenalin is what you'll
be hearing about updates to this year I
heard there was a big push with like
social media integration with it to know
there's some social media integration
with it but then in Dimitri's video he
said it wasn't actually functioning
properly so wasn't a whole lot to speak
to there but yeah you can use it for
instance to stream to YouTube or to
stream to twitch for example but that is
something that might need a little bit
more perhaps a little bit more polish
I'll say framing target control is kind
of a cool function you can use it's in a
situation again this is kind of a power
saving type feature if you're playing a
game that doesn't necessarily need to
run it a hundred and forty-four frames
per second if you're playing like you
know I don't know civilization or just a
game that you don't need that really
fast update of every single frame turn
our frame rate target control you can
tell it where you want to cap your frame
rate at and it's actually a better
solution than vsync so it's a little bit
more flexible and again good for saving
so they go cool Radeon software
adrenalin anyone who has AMD graphics
cards should get it a couple more things
talked about I'm feeling my half is
going to be a little on the short side
today but it's okay
some updates from some at synaptics they
have announced the world's first in
display fingerprint sensor they say it's
going to launch with a top-five
quote-unquote smartphone om so there's
that like Apple and LG
who else everyone will know top 5
smartphone oh yet oh oh yeah Samsung LG
oh yeah Samsung Apple Google now I would
say yeah I guess that's they're supposed
to be manufacturing I don't know if they
still qualify as a manufacturer but one
plus it's one plus a manufacturer yeah
you have to look at market share and
stuff like that but yeah
point is it's you touch the you have to
fingerprint sensor and it's part of the
screen that's that's the point okay
watch this there we go look see that's
how it works so instead of having to put
a fingerprint sensor somewhere on the
actual phone somewhere separate or
whatever it would be cool if you could
if it was just an area if instead of
just like a single spot on your screen
like it looks like it is there if it was
just like the lower the lower third of
your entire phone screen is a giant
fingerprint sensor so it doesn't really
matter if you if you pull your phone out
with your left or right hand you just
you know place it in a general area to
unlock it I'd be cool yeah it says it
integrates say otherwise what's the
point complete security stack with AES
encryption a variety of authentication
features but it does seem to be it is
localized it's something that's situated
underneath the display glass so it would
it wouldn't put the button underneath
wouldn't it wouldn't be like I can just
put my finger anywhere on screen to
unlock like cuz that would be useful
that'd be pretty that'd be pretty easy
to like wherever you're at just enroll
your thumb and you just put your thumb
on your screen right yeah that would be
that would be cool be pretty nice but
yeah it doesn't seem like it works like
that so so it's axe lame what's the
benefit I guess just just saving space I
imagine saving space yeah cuz you gonna
need the electronics for the button on
the back or whatever makes sense
but yet it could end up in all sorts of
phones in 2018 given the hints here they
wouldn't be surprised at the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 was one of the first they
said the galaxy s 8 mounted fingerprint
sensor debacle might be leading to that
and possibly something that Samsung
might want to put out there to show that
they've taken things to the next level
there we go
synaptics all right we we have quite a
few friends who make youtube videos and
a lot of them we have friends are
suffering right yeah we have to
reinforce that yeah a lot of them are
suffering right now under the the
authoritarian authoritarian heel of
YouTube D monetization rampant YouTube D
monetization so this story is maybe
potentially possibly about an answer to
that again potentially possibly and also
this story is one that's appeared a few
different places phrased a few different
ways the TechCrunch I guess had to
update their article or at least did
update their title because they're not
hiring ten thousands content moderators
they're increasing their content
moderation and enforcement staff head
counts to ten thousand what are they at
now I don't know
9950 I mean if they've already got nine
thousand and they're upping it to ten
then it's it's not that big yeah they
said you to reach out to clarify its
hiring numbers this team includes a mix
of different specialists working on
these issues majority who are content
reviewers but the number also includes
other policy specialists who review and
take action on content engineers build
building and refining the machine
learning technologies and policy
specialists training our machine
learning algorithms so this mean that
there are actually real people watching
our YouTube videos and either flagging
them or like unflagging them after room
after like personally reviewing well the
though it doesn't seem like there's any
real person at YouTube the way of the
way it works it works for channels that
are above a certain number of
subscribers
is that they have to like if it gets
flagged then they can they can apply for
manual review yeah and then someone
looks at it and then they say it's okay
usually like from what I've heard if
there's nothing wrong with it right
that's when someone actually looks at it
I see yeah I was unaware that it was
actually a real person looking at it but
yeah I guess that would make sense yeah
I mean from my understanding but that
makes sense yeah yeah there's there's no
there's no real way to be sure right now
what's causing the automatic D
monetization in the first place whether
it's something that's just like oh all
of these channels all of their videos
they just automatically demonetised
right or whether it's something to do
with the channel history or keywords or
something in the description or add it
like who knows yeah it's just just
googled AI and it does what it wants now
but it sucks you have to hope that if
they are actually increasing headcount
an enforcement staff it seems like they
have no other choice but to do that
because they have to hit some kind of
balance between supporting the content
creators who are making content to go on
the website because if they don't have
that content then they don't draw
viewers the viewers of what they need
because the viewers your eyeballs are
what they sell to the advertisers right
and that's how they make the money but
the advertisers don't want your eyeballs
watching their ads if it's right before
a video that's offensive in some way
sure which isn't unreasonable it's why
we had the whole ad pocalypse earlier
this year yes and this is sort of the
ongoing fallout from that so it does
seem like you know you you need that
human intelligence at some level to like
look at things and be like oh this is
these are Hardware unboxed texts these
are the benchmark videos steve has never
uttered unda monetized you know a bad
word in his life as far as we can tell
it's and and yeah like that I don't know
stuff like that so hopefully this helps
I guess that's that's all we can always
say about this
and I guess somewhat good news that it
seems like they are have you ever
watched a hardware inboxed video to the
very end though I'd imagine like after
that's where he puts in all that takes
yeah after like five minutes of like
just black silence it's probably just
probably cuts to Steve like yeah all the
outtakes she was like ma just like
beating his kids you know just like
shoving his wife out the window and
stuff that's I never I never I never
stay for that it's what it's like when
you read it already Channel in Australia
hey you know Aussies he's got to pay the
bills somehow he's pretty hardcore if it
makes sense make sense should be a safe
a shame to yourself Steve speaking of
content creators on YouTube what's your
what's your I haven't wanted to get your
opinion on this whole patreon thing Kyle
ah yes I mean well honestly hit it
abandoning give it up it seems kind of
sketchy to me it it definitely seems
like a cash grab on patreon side I don't
know it's like they're solving one
problem and creating another because I
guess the whole deal was we're trying to
give like patreon as a company they're
trying to give more money back to the
Creator but in doing that they're
actually charging a 35 a 35 percent
service fee for all the patrons so now
the patrons are getting screwed so even
if you're a dollar patron I'm only
paying a buck because that's all I can
afford because I'm a you know a student
in college or high school or whatever
this is their chart by the way they're
just their chart look how much more
money the creators make well it's kind
of chart though but that's
gonna suck if because like your dollar
your dollar donations does it's like
many small donations are kind of the
bread and butter for patreon right like
that that's what you want to get cuz
you're not gonna get a ton of people who
are all gonna be willing to donate 50 or
100 hundred bucks a month it's just it's
not gonna happen right so the dollar
donations is where it's at
in this new situation it's 35 cents per
per fee yeah and it's also dinging
people who
who have multiple patrons there who
patronize patronize
who are patrons creators who are patrons
of multiple creators so whereas before
if you had ten creators and you gave
them each a dollar yeah now you would
get charged ten bucks and it'd be a
single transaction fee now you're
getting charged a transaction fee for
every single one of those it's an
additional three bucks fifty right yeah
so now your ten dollar donation now is
thirteen fifty now something yeah
which is a lot you put the or is it
there's 30 or you're ten dollar donation
now only like seven dollars of that is
going towards the patrons and then three
dollars of that is going towards towards
patreon oh yeah maybe that's it yeah so
but either way either way yeah and it's
um I kind of see the sort of way that
patreon is doing it is like they're
they're charging a flat percentage rate
the service fee is just a flat 35% for
what I know so that means like if you're
like $100 and I get way they're doing it
it's to cover the transaction fees
because transaction fees are royal pain
in the ass they're literally like
robbery and that's why you see like when
you go to restaurants or like liquor
stores they have a minimum if you're
gonna use a credit card it's a $5
minimum because we're getting charged
out the ass just for you swiping that
thing and patreon is like holy we
have so like this community is built off
of one dollar donors or one dollar
patrons and we're losing a ton of
that money from just from transaction
fees so let's charge them a flat 35%
rate but the thing is is like there are
a lot of other patrons who are paying
who are donate donating more than that
dough they're donating $100 $50 $20 but
yet they're still being charged to my
knowledge the same 35% rate which is
gonna be covering more way more than
their transaction fee right if you're
donating $100 to your favorite creator
the transaction fee is not going to be
35%
it's not gonna be $35 so basically
patreon that's that's extra money that's
just floating there that now patreon
gets to pocket so I feel like this is
sort of a way for them to
you increase their their revenue very
sneakily by sort of marketing it as well
we really care about the creators and
that's why we're doing this
so I mean III can't say for sure but it
seems that's the way it's going and it
you know obviously it's not the best
plan because people are dropping left
and right from the platform first the
patrons are dropping because they're
like no I'm not gonna pay a dollar
35 when I was paying you know on
multiple accounts on to multiple
creators and then the patrons then the
creators right according to this under
the current system if you pledge $1 you
pay a dollar what's the change takes
place if you pledge $1 you pay a buck 38
okay buck 38 okay yeah so that's right I
mean great granite and granted that's
looking at the worst case scenario of a
dollar of $1 pledge right but dollar
pledges are often like like those are
those are key like the a dollar pledge
is something that is is is tenable is
something that like an individual who is
not you know independently wealthy or
something like that could afford yeah to
like give a little something to a
creator that they admire and they
appreciate the work their work of right
but you know yeah so so people are
saying it's actually 35 cents not 35
percent 35 cents so that that actually
makes a difference I was saying
percentage I was thickest fee I said if
I said if that's correct not saying that
I admitted the truth it is a two point
nine percent service fee plus 35 cent
charge per transaction okay but this I
mean this is the same the same thing
that I said still applies just not maybe
as great of a scale but still if you're
if you're paying 20 bucks 50 bucks to a
creator you're still getting that 2.9
percent is going to more than cover
whatever transaction fee is attached to
that donation and it's still the
remainder is still being populated by
patreon so it's like yeah creators are
winning now if you don't include all the
patrons that just dropped from the
platform completely but the company's
kind of winning too and I think that's
also what this is about
so it just seems a little
a little sketchy like it doesn't seem
wholly transparent and what what patreon
is plan in all of this and what their
motive is in all of this so this half
true there being half honest the new the
new service fee changes go into effect
on 18th so week from yesterday and you
know we'll we'll keep an eye on it we'll
see we'll see if the patreon is able to
maintain its popularity despite these
changes or if this is the type of thing
people see as just a little too much of
an overreach given that they are ok I
mean they're definitely the most popular
patreon like what is like what is the
patreon like what they is is that like
there are there are patreon patreon
alternatives and they're still playing
and there's definitely patience and and
there's definitely patreon alternatives
who should be seriously considering you
know making a push right now that the
patreon is suffering from some some some
bad press but that's what I'm saying is
it sucks for patreon to have gotten so
popular for so many people to have
joined it and been like wow look at this
site and you know what it's doing for
creators and their ability to make a
living off of what they do and stuff
like that and then for them to go and
change stuff in a way that looks like
they're just trying to kind of get more
money out of out of the process Brandon
and I think a lot of it has to do or
some of it at least has to do with the
fact that they were just like a bunch of
venture capitalists came in with patreon
recently right and they evaluated the
company at like four hundred plus
million dollars which I guess would put
a lot of pressure on patreon to to up
their up their revenue and stuff so I
feel like they they're feeling a lot of
pressure right now from all these
venture capitalists that are dumping
loads of money into the into their
company but I mean well we could matter
no we could talk about capitalism but
instead capitalism capitalism is
depressing but instead let's move on
let's move on to selling our products by
the way did you ever do we ever circle
back to the Bitcoin mining survey no I
didn't okay I feel bad about that
everyone said that the link didn't work
so no it definitely work saying - do I
need any new beer though yes that's it
what would you like I guess I guess I
guess to break into my popcorn see the
dirty mayor which is a citizen cider
that sounds good
a cider cider this guy which is the
alchemist tea of the alchemists in
Vermont which is heady and topper it's
8% I don't know it's an American double
IPA they see ginger cider mosaic which
looks like it's five point five so it's
probably a lighter beer okay so I'm kind
of interested in this cider actually
honestly it take the cider I'm sure it's
good ingredients 100% locally sourced
apple cider ginger lemon peel that's all
you know I like ciders care who knows
it's I'm a cider fan naturally gluten
free not to be confused with spider fan
so again going back to our little straw
poll our ask the audience raffle do you
have the bitcoins you have all the
Bitcoin that we what do you think here
wait where do you think our audience
will land what will be the number one
answer
are any of these answers like cop-out
answers that I can't choose or can I
choose any of them no you can go with
any of them they're all perfectly
legitimate just either I have none at
all I have less than 1 1 to 10 10 to 100
100 plus or no big claim but I do have
other you know maybe you've got a theory
m'early like claim like going off anyone
and when jumping on that like like coin
coin um honestly though I think I would
I would I would say the majority of our
viewers are crypto broke like me and you
because I mainly because I see most more
complaints about crypto mining in the
comments than I do comment supporting my
name do you any mean like I see
everyone's like any time someone or any
other youtuber does a video on crypto
mining in any way that supports it it's
like we're gonna build the crypto mind
you like all the comments are super
negative
and there's a huge backlash I haven't
seen anyone in my comments personally
saying like hey you should do a crypto
mining build or something like that so I
would imagine most people are just
trying to use GPUs for gaming sorry
several people in chat are having
aneurysms because the Hettie topper
which know that they say it what did you
say heavy topper I did I didn't click
with me I have heard of Hettie topper
I'm familiar with Headey topper the
hell's heavy hover it's a very very
popular and well-known IPA like a type
of IPA or brand of like a like it brand
like it's um yeah it's like a heady
topper from where Vermont it's from
Vermont all of these are from Vermont I
like we're on the west coast
I mean we're super west coast I have
never heard of I've never seen that beer
for anyone in anime for anyone in chat
who's getting upset we're gonna have
you'll drink the hoodie topper next well
that yeah with you sure yeah I will
drink the heady topper now it's my next
choice I'm sure you'll immediately just
jizz everywhere so I don't know what I
said wait so wait is it heavy topper a
heady an top-heavy topper okay okay I
thought that was an answer ampersand now
first glance I mean I was like just
looking in the fridge there's a little
weird symbol in between Hedy and topper
and it looks like an ampersand at first
glance
so I said heavy and Tony toppers is up
there with like the damnit the blimey
yeah the planning it's it's one of those
really kind of legendary known
well-known and you got to drink it
straight from the can I've heard of Hedy
and topper like that it's not the first
time I've heard that word or name but I
just did not I have no recollection of
what a tasty well is it good it's cuz
it's ginger ginger later he's living
there too Oh lemon ginger oh that was it
that was a flavor that was a right is I
just talking about a wild ride a flavor
flavor journey cuz it first I was like
my first does like cider and I was like
oh it's got that ginger in there and
like I've been and I'm little developing
a taste for ginger my like my wife loves
ginger love ginger so I've
I like the ginger then as I was sort of
enjoying the pleasant balance between
the two
suddenly lemon was like hey we're here
I'm here too with 11 and and then I was
like the snozzberries taste like
snozzberries there's another one in
there so I'll probably drink that one
okay mmm this is almost out though
yeah hey what did you say
I'm saying that everyone's crypto broke
all right crypto broke most of arms what
Carlos things are not mining I'm gonna
say less - I mean I your I probably
would have picked that - if I if I had
to choose but I'll say less than one
Bitcoin the second most popular answer
perhaps I feel like if you've got some I
think if you have other cryptocurrency
usually other cryptocurrencies you you
buy and sell via bit like you trade it
the other cryptocurrency for Bitcoin and
then you cash out the big blue yeah
usually how that works right all right
I'm gonna say I'm gonna say less someone
okay
people say no and yeah 69% almost the
magic number almost 7 out of 10 high
name and I did choose correctly okay
then one Bitcoin and the best you could
so that is 69 79 that's 85 percent yeah
only 15% who have nothing or less than
one Bitcoin and even even even 96% who
have I mean I guess other crip different
maybe you might have a lot of other
cryptocurrency baby so you had the
dogecoin in the world obvious obviously
still slightly Anish and seven people
who have 100 plus bitcoins are liars oh
yeah I have 100 plus bitcoins bitches
I'd be surprised if one of those was
true maybe - maybe - I'll give me two
but I think I think also you throwing in
the word bitches kind of it drew people
to people my codes
it's funny yeah so I mean you had a
hundred bitcoins
I mean we're be a millionaire
millionaire no sorry
you'd be rich you'd be pretty well he
would be a millionaire you would render
bitcoins v110 1.75 million hundred times
ten thousand yeah all you needed to be
as valued at ten thousand so yeah he'll
a millionaire that's crazy
all right um guys that is all for my
prepared remarks for this half of
Awesome hardware we're going to quickly
run down the donations that people have
made in check I thought I saw a hundred
dollar donation in there which is why
you guys probably whoa hilarious for a
second but here we go and also will sell
thank you for for being here and Excel
so and moderating as always be love you
Joseph key with the final donation what
a you shot this is I don't know
what this is what does she do Sheena B -
oh no mo is that she not G ha is that
can you pronounce that Kyle you're kind
of Asian what is that one for represent
13 days till I finish my PC upgrade it
means that you are going to die tomorrow
yep he wrote us in the book well clearly
his real name is like here you got me
I'm curious what language is is that
Japanese hey baby guess it's a Japanese
but I'm not sure not for my maid of my
native tribe well thank you Joe and I
wish you the best of luck your fancy
upgrade upcoming pup Shepard five
dollars and sixty nine cents sent Kyle a
mug Moe just keep an eye out for the
mail time I will I haven't checked my
Peele box in a long time but I haven't
either I feel like there might be too
much stuff there because but I'll check
it will do will do mail time next week
yep I promise there's nothing that we
get your video demonetised feel free to
sub to buy YouTube
nice pop I don't know maybe maybe
recommending that people sub to pups
pups YouTube might get
video demonetised I'm sure he goes that
deep is there every particle is trying
at one time everyone go said the pups
pups YouTube so you're mad on Twitter
it's an experience yep 18 plus automatic
automatic Matt $10 donation hey guys
back from boot camp oh my god oh crap
I'm I'm in my a IT training for servers
for the army molest donation he did he
was like I'm going off to boot can Oh
like member that was quick yeah was is
boot camp like they just then again like
my perception of the passage of time is
it's probably not one to be it gets
worse and worse as I get older which is
like was that a month ago or five years
ago I could be that was 2012 wow we're
losing our minds but that's that as you
survived clearly so that's a huge
achievement automatic Matt thank you
very much for the inspiration and the
donation I hope they did not break your
spirit doesn't seem like it's probably
heli dragon five ten for the ten bucks
and two cents I've got that two cents in
there Paul you suggested I upgrade my
Linux box to Horizon three instead of
upgrading my second gen I five twenty
three twenty so I can put my set my
seven seventeen hundred in it when I
upgrade my gaming PC I did it Rison
three thirteen hundred x hashtag rising
all the things beautiful excellent heli
dragon I'm not sure if you're already
familiar with the level one techs
channel but they've been doing a lot of
stuff with Ryan and Linux specifically

you for hanging out for the whole
livestream that was a was crazy was lots
of fun oh yeah Brussels is in Belgium
uh-huh I need that I told you that this
is sorted that was another one of those
times where you said something and then
I said something I was like I'm pretty
sure never trust my words job quite
enough to immediately immediately
immediately shut it down yeah we can
always rely on you for being sober and
stuff to stick with the very generic
it's in Europe Yeah right it was like
somewhere in this part of the world
Fred Brandt $100 $100 my god Fred
Paul you still need to punish Kyle what
for taking off his wedding ring oh come
on I'm wearing it right now Fred look
come on have some mercy please set up a
straw poll and let all decide his
punishment this is cruel this is
actually like brutal torture check
number one cherry pie in the face I like
I don't like cherry pies oh that is a
real punishment for me you know - you
know I hate cherry pie - how does he
know to eat entire stick of Carolina
Reaper jerky we all know that I can't
handle that not many people can to be
honest three picture of ice water
overhead oh you should definitely go
with that one we can definitely
Photoshop that and for wifey sauces
choice anything but for I will I will
accept any option but whatever whatever
any things anything that wife knows she
knows my true weaknesses she knows my
she knows my kryptonite all right she is
my Lex Luthor people end me at any rate
- Fred that strawpoll I hope never comes
to light and Paul never takes initiative
to actually make it happen no stop at
the bars and chat like like how
YouTube's just like slowly chugging
along like I picked my nose today and
twitch is like Oh flurry of fours number
three picture of ice water overhead ah
oh my god see okay yeah see anything
before see I can handle all the rest
number three consider that my punishment
all token for the team just now I'm just
glad that considering you know the
donation gives him the power to just
dictate things that we do he's dictating
stuff for you to do and not me
for everyone wants for and now and now
YouTube chimed in beautiful Fred
whatever whatever is decided there it
doesn't seem like four is the popular
choice so I imagine we'll have to
implement that during Kyle's half of the
show I don't know if I think I think
Heather said if she decides I feel like
as number four and as the last item on
the list though she could easily choose
all of the above
well this is what that's usually why she
just put in chat for she what did she
want you to shave your head so go ahead
honey she kept trying to get you to do
them on Saturday I I don't understand
cuz I feel like
shaving the head that that's like a
punishment to her to because now she's
married to me
with the shaved head and no one honestly
no one wants to see that shoot yeah it
seems very uh masochistic coming anyways
thank you so much thank you Frank your
generous donation yes
these are her ten Australian salute
salute Cheers automatic Matt once again
five dollars gotta go guys I'll watch
tomorrow and get back up to date on your
vids
thanks Matt thinking Matt have a good
one we love you Matthew Strom six
dollars and sixty six cents
super metal we've got would it be too
risky to invest a couple hundred in
Bitcoin for a couple days rather than
investing a couple thousand well a
couple hundred is always less risky than
a couple thousand but it's it's it's
like playing the stock market kind of
way you know you're gambling you're
gambling in a sense you're hoping that
the value of Bitcoin of whatever you
invest is going to increase it could and
you could make Bank or it could decrease
and you might lose money at a certain
point it really is that that's we're not
going to tell you how to I'm not going
to tell you how to spend your money that
is a something that could be very
lucrative or very anti lucrative for you
I I don't know it's one of the reasons
why I'm like I'm concerned like I I
earned my own money I work hard to do it
and I it it's why I don't gamble a whole
lot it's because sometimes I get freaked
out at the thought of losing a bunch of
money so quickly and I'd rather just
work really hard to earn the money
instead of trying to get some super
get-rich-quick thing that works for some
people
god bless them and you know that's
awesome but you know now you're just
 - it just just just dump your
whole life savings into Bitcoin this is
honestly what you should do just sell
your house or whatever other assets
liquidate all your assets and just just
just buy like 30,000 mining rigs and
dump all your money into Bitcoin and
this point in the show where I feel like
I should point out that this show is
satire it's meant for amusements
obviously no one should be yeah i listen
to cow lost my little love Matthew I can
certainly appreciate the question you
and I would never I would never give
anyone advice on that because I know it
would go exactly opposite I wouldn't I
would tell you know never invest in that
and the next day would rule or until you
absolutely drop everything and then it
like whatever like so but like I said
it's volatile it's a gamble so yeah I
could go down high-risk high-reward
yeah wow what a coolness though this
kind of camera baracy this kind of buzz
camera bussiness 10-year Rose hey boys

involve some woodworking it's also part
of it but yes it's still coming Matt
it's still coming
just slowly so she said yeah MMB sixty
seven thirteen dollars and 37 cents
donation for a leak Channel Happy
Holidays Paul thanks man appreciate it
sir cheers thank you
Elita Christmas ginger and excellent use
of the lead speaking German I'm an e 99
$5 hey Paul would a VPN get around
issues from no net neutrality hey Kyle I
hope to get my PC features some time on
pip my PC so I mean anything that's a
good question it was actually brought up
on my net neutrality in-depth video as
well it depends yeah generally speaking
if you look at how the internet works
right now yes that probably would if
there was a specific website or a
specific service that your internet
service provider decided we don't want
you to have access to that or like it's
a competing service from something that
we provide so we don't want to give you
access a VPN won't get around that if we
eventually get to the point where
Internet service providers are like hey
when we give you an internet connection
we're connecting you to our Internet's
and our services and that's what you get
access to and then you have another tier
up here where you can access the
Internet in general mm-hmm what they
might do is actually block anything
except the IP addresses that connect
directly to their services in which case
a VPN would do you no good because your
VPN IP addresses would be blocked as
well granted that's a hypothetical
situation and may or may not actually
happen but yes they could even keep you
from doing what she wants even with a
VPN in that situation she's basically
they would only allow you to connect to
whitelisted IP addresses and websites
and services and nothing else shooting
but good cell processing $5.00
hey guys Congrats on the charity you
killed it I'm proud of you from the
elusive cell AI thank you so thanks
dolls stop giving us money like yes
domina and so I like I like tell cells
voice was just kind of like in like
they're so like Jarvis right that's what
somebody else had mentioned he was
really cool ever-present throughout the
stream thank you very much for that cell
for the donation and for being an
awesome mod dingo on my $45 which mini
ITX case you guys like fractal design no
- OH - or Silverstone ml0 eight Beach mm
I've only worked with the no - OH -
you've done I've owned Burton and I've
only built in the
you never know no to or to build I've
never actually built in the note okay no
so it's a good question the ml 0 8 B
definitely suffers from a lack of
airflow if you keep the the dust filters
on the side and whereas I like dust
filters I don't like the lack of airflow
the problem is that you don't have
anything active
there's no that they're just sitting
there like out in space and you just put
the filter on there so there's nothing
to pull air through it so all you have
is like a fan sitting there inside the
system and it just yeah so if you're
willing to modify the ml 0e it's kind of
an ode to of to it and and and maybe
maybe add a slim fan on there something
like that or work with the lack of air
flow situation then yeah I think it's a
perfect it's a nice little case and I
like the little handle nice and that's
what our friend Rachel we I built the
system for her and she took it to China
and she's using it over there right now
so nice little portable case but just
you got to really keep that air flow
problem in mind and and node to a to
also very solid very small case yeah for
mini ITX can be modded to fit in a io
source nice to me I did it I did it I
did the thing all right thank you very
much dingo for the donation clint Flippo

Heather very cute alright finally a yes
as I was guys giv five dollar donation
overheard you say patreon fee is 35
percent flat fee we did Craig later on
sorry for the oversight there as we were
talking about thank you for the donation
and correcting us yep hopefully anyone
who heard a semi self-interest listen
long enough update long enough to hear
us correct it as well yes of course
links to all the stuff all the articles
that we talked about today or in this
videos
since if you guys wanna read up a little
bit more any of those feel free to do so
we have one more donation one more
donations from Jew jeebies from the five
bucks found out why my keyboard and
mouse didn't work from last week it was
due to risin no support for Windows 7
purchased Windows 10 from kinguin but
getting error code of the mail helped
that is alright your keyboard and mouse
didn't work because of rice
dude I don't know 7 that's weird human
interface device drivers are pretty
standardized and yeah for basic
functionality and stuff so windows 7 to
Windows 10 shouldn't really cause that
kind of an issue Oh double check your
drivers are updated just for your USB in
case there maybe even your rear i/o
maybe it's a part of a controller and
not natively built into the chips that
are something like that might even
download a driver for that if you did
the Windows 10 or the king went up if
you purchased a Windows 10 key from
kinguin my recommendation everyone who
does that is to activate immediately if
it doesn't activate when you attempt to
activated to immediately do the callin
function and yeah do the thing where you
telephone numbers and then that came
back to you and usually that works yeah
neither of those works then immediately
request a refund from kinguin right and
that's kind of your ABC there and so I
know he's a buying an erection from
kinguin I always buy it it's like a buck
50 maybe 2 bucks but it's it's worth it
because they will immediately refund it
if you have that that protection yeah
yeah
