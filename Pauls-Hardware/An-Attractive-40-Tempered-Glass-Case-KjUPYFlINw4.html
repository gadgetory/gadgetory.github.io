to you by gigabyte coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake okay guys I'm a
deep cool they have a few new cases
right here on the deep cool side and
we're going to take a look at some
all-in-one liquid coolers over on the
gamer storm site so let's start with the
cases behind me and I'm gonna start by
telling you their prices forty bucks 60
bucks
ninety bucks now one thing I should
point out right of up front is that none
of these cases are going to ship with
fans so you get to choose your own fans
and put them in but forty bucks and
tempered glass on two side panels so
let's take a closer look so starting
with matrix 55 $40 case and tempered
glass on both the front piece right here
as well as a side panel right here deep
pools keeping things pretty basic with
the design of these cases albeit $40 I
can keep putting that up so the tempered
glass mounts just with the four screws
on the four corners like you have seen
some early tempered glass version so you
can pop that off not the simplest way to
put it on and off but it holds it
securely and it is rubberized on there
internally it's pretty open so you're
not gonna have like a power supply
shroud down at the bottom it's pretty
open in the front too that does allow
them to support up to a ATX motherboard
sizes so you can pretty put a pretty
large motherboard in here down at the
bottom there is a hard drive cage to fit
a couple 3.5 inch hard drives power
supplies at the back like on most cases
of this design for i/o up in the front
you got a USB 3.0 a couple USB 2.0 mic
and headphone jack power and reset
other than that though a pretty standard
case design and it does look like
there's a decent amount of space behind
the motherboard tray as well no grommets
or anything like that but again a $40.00
case so really the selling points here
gonna be your tempered glass as well as
of course plenty of radiator support in
fact up to three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator support in the front
up to two hundred and eighty millimeter
radiator and the top as well as possibly
120 at the back if you want to do that
we've also got magnetic dust filter so
you can remove that like that and clean
it pretty much all the basic functions
you want in a case for 40 bucks with
tempered glass just bring your own fence
next is a matrix 70 similar designed to
the 55 but we have added an RGB accent
strip down the front and that does come
with the case but again the fans do not
and it also has an RGB controller that's
integrated there and they've also added
three buttons on the top so if you're
not connecting to the motherboard for
the RGB you can't connect it to the
controller and you can cycle through
some various RGB effects with that for
Iowa here you have a single USB 3.0 and
a single USB 2.0 so not the most
expansion but you do get the basics
taken care of and then you get a little
bit more radiator support here 360 in
the front 360 in the top and again 120
in the back possibly and finally the
matrix 75 this one's gonna cost you in
ninety bucks but you do get some
upgrades over the other versions first
off you get the option of a mesh front
panel you can swap those up pretty
easily actually so pop one up and pop
the other one on depending whether you
want to look pretty with the timber
glass or have a bit of dust filtration
as well as a little bit more airflow
this one also maintains that RGB strip
down the front just like the 70 over
there and then you get a bit better IO
here you actually get four USB 3.0 ports
with two headers internally in the case
so you can connect those up to your
motherboard again ehx support then this
one actually looks like it might be a
little bit better suited for water
cooling you get a couple of SSD trays
actually up here in the top right and
then there's a bit of a rail panel below
that so potential mounting location for
a pump or a reservoir or something along
those lines you also have these
removable panels at the top so you can
remove those if you want to let air out
or keep them on if you want to keep
noise in speaking of the top 360 red
support here compared in 60 red support
in the front and then again of course
potential 120 at the back if you want to
do that also worth pointing out that
this one they have actually added some
rubber grommets for the cable management
passed through holes so it's going to
keep things a lot more clean when it
comes to routing your cables and also
all of your internal cabling here is all
black so you're not gonna have any ugly
ketchup and mustard even on the HD audio
even the HD audio is all black cable or
the current tempered glass piece for the
side panel here is actually a temporary
situation they said when they actually
bring this to market it's gonna hinge at
the back and it will swing out I'm sorry
imitating how that over
right now you guys get the idea right so
those are the new matrix cases from deep
pool again
40 bucks 60 bucks 90 bucks and they're
expecting needs to be out in September
2018 and now over here the gamers storm
side gamers storm is deep pools gaming
oriented sub brand so they have a couple
new all-in-one liquid coolers this is
the castle RGB Series and the claim to
fame for these is that they feature
thread Ripper supportin so they've made
the copper contact plate on the bottom
larger for threader for support and
they're also going to include the
hardware for threader for mounting in
the box these are also compatible with
the mainstream AMD and Intel platforms
as well as Intel high-end platform as
well so just about any modern CPU can be
cooled with this cooler and has also got
a new design so you might be familiar
with the little tube through design that
they've been doing with their captain
over here for a while for the castle
they've integrated the pump down at the
bottom and I also have a little viewing
window with a circular addressable RGB
glow but the gamers storm logo right in
the middle and it's a pretty cool effect
I think these are a bit taller so they
do stand out a little bit more from the
CPU but they are available in 280 as
well as 240 versions these are aluminum
radiators and they're going to be
available in July 2018 for a cost 110
bucks for the 240 and 130 bucks for the
280 and finally here's the captain 240
pro addressable RGB LED fans at 280
millimeter radiator they've also updated
the addressable RGB LEDs it's on the
pump again it's a similar pump design
that you've seen from gamers storm
before with their captain series
difference here is the radiator has
actually been updated it has a pressure
release points right up here so in order
to extend the lifespan of your
all-in-one liquid cooler as temperatures
go up and down and pressure might mounts
up within the within the loop this will
release that and according to do cool
will make your olive one liquid cooler
last longer
that's a captain 240 Pro available in
August 2018 for 120 bucks the guys
that's been the deep pool and gamers
storm boost here at Computex 2018 I want
to of course say a big thank you to my
sponsors for this events gigabytes
