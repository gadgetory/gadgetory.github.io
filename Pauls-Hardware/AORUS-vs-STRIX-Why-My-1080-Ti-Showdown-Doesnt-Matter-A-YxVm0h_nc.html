excellent there are two steps to
choosing a GPU you got to choose the GPU
and then you got to choose the GPU what
I mean to say is first you must choose
which GPU you want like the actual
graphics processing unit like an RX 580
from Radeon or the nvidia gtx 980ti like
what i'm using in the cards i have here
today and then you must choose which
actual graphics card based on that GPU
you want to get since there are usually
quite a few versions from adding card
manufacturers like asus or gigabytes
among others today's video is going to
be about that second choice how to
choose a specific graphics card based on
the GPU that you've already selected
since i'm actually asked that question
quite a bit today my matchup is between
two gtx 980ti beta cards the asus strix
1080 TI and the gigabyte horas 1080i and
i'll be pinning these two cards against
each other while also pointing out the
areas of distinction that you can use
when choosing any graphics card so first
off obviously the GPU is going to be
exactly the same between these two
different cards the code name of the GPU
is GP 102 and that means they'll both
have 3584 cuda cores 224 texture units
1888 are Opie's 12 billion transistors
etc all the specs that apply to that GPU
now that means that the performance of
these cards when it comes to straight
pixel pushing in a 3d render application
should also be the same although this
would depend on the GPUs clock speed now
the asus strix actually runs at the
exact same speed as the Auris when it
comes to base and boost clocks although
under load the Strix was running a
little bit faster at 1911 megahertz on
average thanks to GPU boost versus the
Auris which was only hitting 1847 I
think this is actually due to the Strix
running in a bit higher voltage 1.04 9
volts versus the Auris which was at 0.96
- a bit more conservative these are
those little details that can change
from card to card based on the V bios
it's loaded but the main point though is
that how much you can
clock will be much more dependent on
your specific GPU than the card and the
cooler that's built around it it is the
silicon lottery and some people just get
lucky with getting a better overclocking
GPU than others unless you're
specifically buying a card that says the
GPU is binned for performance which EVGA
and a few others have done in the past
but to my knowledge not has not been
done with the 1080i in any versions your
overclocking performance will be
somewhat random and it won't really
matter which graphics card you actually
choose one final mention before we get
into what actually makes a difference
between two cards like this is how much
memory you get now the 1080i is they're
all going to ship with loving gigs of
DDR 5x but some cards have versions that
might have more or less memory the GTX
1060 for example might have 3 gigs or 6
gigs depending on what version you get
if you're in the situation I usually
recommend opting for the version with
more memory if you can afford it as that
will help you run games at higher
resolutions so I'm not focusing on
benchmarking performance for this video
but here are some firestrike ultra
results just to show how clock speed
affects performance out of the box asus
strix pulls ahead just slightly due to
that higher average sustained boost
clock but when I overclocked both cards
manually the Auris 1080p I was actually
stable with a plus 75 core clock whereas
the Strix had to be dialed back to about
plus 50 this allowed the horas to
leapfrog the Strix when I reran the
tests and edged it out with a slightly
higher sustained core clock all this is
to say though that raw performance is
not the primary deciding factor that you
should be looking at when it comes to
choosing your graphics card if the GPU
is a constant what you should be
focusing on is the cards build quality
aesthetics noise levels cooling extras
which is a catch-all category and
pricing so let's talk build quality and
this will overlap with cooling and noise
levels just a little bit of course but
don't overlook details like how well the
card is put together and what materials
are used personally I like that Oris
went with an all-metal shroud to protect
the thin stacks and fans underneath
whereas these trick shroud here is made
of plastic these are both high-end cards
though was multiple copper heat pipes
for cooling they're very heavy both of
them which means that there's lots of
mass in their thermal mass that can
absorb heat and they both have very nice
high quality back plates I would get or
as a hard time
for their copper GPU backplate panels
that put on there which gamers Nexus did
a video on it has shown to be pretty
much pointless when it comes to actual
cooling but they do have a massive GPU
and memory cooling plate on this cart on
the front side of it where it matters a
little bit more so hopefully that makes
up for it both cards though are very
well built I would give the edge to the
Auris though here for that all metal
shroud now aesthetics might mean nothing
to you if your case doesn't have a side
panel window and that's okay you can
just ignore this category but for many
PC builders out there it does make a
difference especially if you watch RGB
LEDs the design work we have is a bit
subjective of course some people might
like one more than the other but overall
I like the Strix car just a little bit
better when it comes to looks I've said
for quite a while with that when RGB
LEDs exists on a card as they do on both
of these there should be no other fixed
colors for some reason gigabyte keeps
using orange accents which makes
everyone sad except people who are
building in a be quiet case I guess I
also like the asus loop with nickel
plating on wherever they had potentially
exposed copper which I think also leads
to a cleaner overall look there's also
that RGB LED experience and both Asus
and gigabyte have software solutions
that can control and sync lighting with
your motherboard as long as it's an asus
or gigabyte motherboard with asus aura
or the gigabyte RGB fusion software
supports the RGB rog backplate logo on
the Strix card looks pretty nice - of
course when it's lit up and synced and
to be fair there is an horas extreme
1080 Ti that also has that backplate
lights up feature the gains here by the
Strix card in the aesthetics category
will be countered when we get to the
price category for the non extreme
version of the Auris card also just to
point out the Strix card does have an
RGB LED header on the end of the card
itself which means that you could expand
your lighting without necessarily
needing an Asus or a compatible
motherboard and that's a nice feature
now noise level is next in those levels
in cooling or actually probably the most
important factor is practically speaking
if you want my wholehearted opinion
starting with noise and using my new
sound level meter here is each card
running at 25 50 and 75 percent fan
speed
you
now those tests might make it seem like
the Strix is the latter card but
remember I'm using percentages of the
maximum fan speed and the Strix fans max
about 3900 RPM whereas the Auris goes up
to 2900 so in that 75% test the Strix
was at 2750 rpm the Auris was only at 20
175 well actually under a normal gaming
load though the Asus Strix fan speed
topped out at about 44% 1592 RPM and
horas fan speed hit 55% but also about
15 85 rpm and at that speed the noise
level was down to about 41 DBA and very
quiet for both cards that takes us into
our cooling comparison which was again a
bit of a wash with both cards performing
within about a degree of each other
not bad both are good coolers but again
it makes that decision-making process
just a bit tougher now it comes to
extras with graphics cards that actually
covers a lot of grounds this is my
catch-all category whether its
accessories or bonus features
but honestly accessories weren't much to
speak up for either of these cards they
had some documentation and a non non
sleeved peg power splitter that was
pretty much all you got some other
bonuses though include peg power LEDs on
both cards which is kind of a nice
feature
Asus originally introduced this but it
will let you know via an LED light when
you plug in the power if the power is
plugged in or not so if it's not plugged
in it's very obvious now the Auris card
here also has expanded video outs it's
got an additional HDMI out on the back
and an internal VR HDMI for it to pass
through to front panel port on your case
this could be a very key selling point
for someone doing a VR focus build since
having the amount of internal HDMI
connectors this is always there the asus
strix card on the other hand includes
internal fan headers two of them on the
card itself four pin PWM so you can have
more case fans connected to the card
that will run on a speed based on the
GPU temperature also next to that Asus
put an RGB header as already mentioned
and I've also included voltage Reed
points on the board for people who are
doing high-end overclocking and actually
want to get direct voltage readings off
the card itself
you might also want to consider in this
extras category the warranty you get for
the card the company's reputation for
the card that you're buying and then
also return policies and step-up
programs in here I just like to point
out EVGA s
have a long-standing step-up program
that's very nice but stuff like that you
definitely want to take a look at when
you're comparing cards between different
manufacturers finally of course there is
the price because going back to my
original statement that the GPU is
really the main factor when it comes to
the actual performance you get it would
sound like most people should just get a
six hundred $99 founders Edition card
and call it a day
the or is 1080 Ti cost seven hundred and
twenty dollars right now at noon and for
that twenty dollars you get better
cooling a quieter card and some
additional features versus the founders
Edition asus rog Strix 1080 TI cost
seven hundred and eighty dollars right
now and for that extra $80 you get
better cooling a quieter card and some
additional features versus the founders
edition so to conclude this video i
would say that asus probably wins this
match up if price is no object which it
might not be if you're in the market for
a 1080 TI lots of people's hope gaming
computers don't cost seven hundred plus
dollars like one of these 1080p eyes
costs if you just want 1080p high
performance though and aesthetics are
less of a concern and you don't think
sixty dollars is worth things for some
additional RGB features and voltage read
points then the Auris 1080p eye is
probably right up your alley and I would
recommend it over the founder's edition
but guys that is all for this video
