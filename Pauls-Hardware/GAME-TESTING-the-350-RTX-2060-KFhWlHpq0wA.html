coverage of CES 2019 I'd like to start
out by thanking my sponsors for this
event Coolermaster Animax deep cool and
Corsair and I'm not in Las Vegas yet I
am actually at home still because the
first video of CES 2019 is going to be
on this graphics card the r-tx 2060 so
if you're watching this it should be
January 7th after I think 7:00 a.m.
Pacific time and the r-tx 2060 was just
announced last night at a keynote given
by Jensen I'm sure he was wearing his
leather jacket and I'm sure it went
great
oh that's in the future for me but I
don't to get too distracted by time
travel long story short the r-tx 2060 is
in videos new graphics card it was
touring architecture support for ray
tracing and it has been expected for
some time since they launched the 2080
TI and the 2080 and the 2070 logic
dictates they'll do a 2060 as well and
here it is now the launch price for this
graphics card is 350 dollars and that is
for the founders Edition that I have
here or add inboard third-party designs
that we will also see trickling out very
soon so it's kind of nice that Nvidia
isn't doing the more expensive price for
the founders Edition again like they did
before that was somewhat confusing
however we are looking at a three
hundred and fifty dollar sixty series
cards whereas if you're looking like
1060 well that was like a 250 dollar
card maybe 300 when you're talking about
the depths of the GPU mining fad so I
think there's two ways to look at this
either you have a gtx 1070 class card
that's launching for 350 dollars because
this should theoretically beat the gtx
1070 or you're looking at the nvidia
again increasing the price of their 60
series cards which previously have sold
for around 250 ish dollars if cost is a
concern for you you might be consoled
somewhat by the fact that there is a
limited-time game bundle that's
associated with this if you buy an RT x
2060 you will get a copy either of
battlefield 5 or anthem which is not a
bad add-on now physically this card is
very similar to the founders edition of
the 20 80 20 70 and 20 80 TI however
there is not a supplemental power
connector on this side they've actually
moved that to the end over here it is an
8 pin on this one and that is probably
due to the fact that under the hood this
is a modified version of
Turing tu 106 GPU because the same one
that they use in the 2070 at $350 this
card is aimed at gamers who are playing
at high refresh rate 1080 or at 1440 not
necessarily a 4k card at least according
to Nvidia it has 6 gigs of memory and
I'll get into more detailed stats in
just a second and according to Nvidia
this will run battlefield 5 at 1080 at
Ultra settings with ray-tracing turned
on and set to ultra and get you nearly
60 frames per second now because I'm
about to leave for Vegas I've hacked
some stats together for you guys this is
the Nvidia reviewers guides and actually
the past three of them looking at the
2060 on the left-hand side the middle is
showing you the 2070 comparisons on the
right side is the r-tx 2080 all of these
stat columns are roughly the same so you
can get a bit of a side-by-side
comparison but the 2060 I think would
compare to the 1070 if you're looking at
what you're getting from last generation
to this gen or you want to compare to
the 2070 if you want to look at where
you're getting for 350 bucks here versus
the $500 price of the 2070 so first off
you get 30 streaming multi processors
versus 36 on the 2070 1920 CUDA cores
which is the same as the gtx 1070
although it's not a direct comparison
since you're talking about different
generations of GPU technology 2,304 is
how many cuda cores of 2070 has the 2080
has 2944 as for RT cores you get 30 of
them with the 2060 as compared to 36 on
the 2070 or 46 on the 2080 and then on
this version you get 6 gigs of GDD are 6
memory running at 14 gigabits per second
that gives you 300 36.1 gigabytes per
second of total memory bandwidth which
is less than the r-tx 2070 which has 448
but a significant bump over the 1070
which is 256 gigabytes per second I will
point out that you're getting 6 gigs
instead of 8 gigs so it is cut down
there that didn't seem to hurt the r-tx
2060s performance when it came to
invidious test results with all shit
which I'll share with you in just a
second but it does probably indicate why
it's not recommended for 4k because
you're dealing with less overall video
memory
rounding out the stats you also get 240
tensor cores a GPU boost clock of 1680
megahertz and a TDP of 160 Watts that's
compared 250 watts for the 1070
175 watts for the 2070 now because this
graphics card is launching in sort of a
weird in-between time at the end of the
holidays just before CES I know it's
going out for some reviews however I'm
not expecting there to be a lot of them
and they're probably gonna vary
depending on how thorough all of them
are and depending on whether people were
on vacation what I'm gonna do for you
guys today is take this card plug it
into this system right here which I have
been using it has a ninety nine hundred
K it is the top-of-the-line gaming
system to give this card the best
performance it can possibly get and I
will run some tests I'm gonna run the
same tests that I ran with this Horace
2080 ti that is not the fairest
comparison to make here but if you want
to see the difference or what you get
with a 12 or $1400 graphics card versus
this you can look back at those numbers
and kind of get a side-by-side for what
I'm gonna be showing you guys today so
we're doing live testing and capturing
on a separate computer so it's not
affecting the gameplay performance here
we're gonna run through those and at
least give you guys an idea of if you're
gonna spend 350 bucks on this graphics
card what kind of performance you should
expect now in the Nvidia reviewers guide
they always list some performance
results that they have gotten themselves
and these are usually pretty accurate
when it comes to the actual performance
they can sometimes be selective on what
games they choose to test and
resolutions so take these numbers with a
grain of salt and wait for some
independent reviews but just to get us
going here is what Nvidia says the r-tx
2060 can do so if you're comparing it to
the GTX 970 right here which i think is
gonna be your main point of comparison
we can see at 1920 by 1080 it is it's
faster according to Nvidia maybe between
10 and 40 percent faster depending on
what your game you're playing except for
it man 2 where it's a little bit slower
of course if you compare it to the old
1060 and is faster across the board and
then compared to the 1070 TI they say
it's 1% faster as well but again I would
wait for some more independent tests on
this I think the 2060 versus 1070 is
probably a good metric to go by though
for 2560 by 1440 here we can also see
that according to Nvidia it is faster
than the 1070 by about 21% faster across
the board and all their tests including
hitman 2 so that's good too again they
say it's still faster than 770 Ti but
I've already shown you too many of in
videos numbers let's move on alright
guys I'm using driver version 4 17.5 4
and we're starting out with 4 tonight as
I play you'll be able to see stats in
the top
the cpu stats as well as GPU temperature
frequency and usage GPU memory usage GPU
fan speed and of course fps in green and
each game I'm going to start out playing
at 2560 by 1440 and if necessary I will
also try at 1080 currently using epic
settings by the way and I'm only just
gonna play for a minute or two at each
setting before moving on
all right so indoors we're getting in
the 90s frames per second wise and went
out of doors
maybe it's dipping down into the may
date mid to low 80s and being shot and I
died we've switched to 1920 by 1080 now
still at epic settings just to see if we
can get some more frames for a second
alright so initially we're in the
hundred and 30s 130 range a boom box
right up on this guy doesn't even see me
hey I have no idea how the boom box
works but ultimately we're getting 130
ish frames per second maybe dipping down
into the one tenth of one 20s here at
1920 by 1080 as compared to 1440 where
we were getting maybe 90 FPS max and
then dipping down into the 80s and
sometimes 70s moving on to some
overwatch and our current settings are
2560 by 1440 we're using the ultra
preset frame rate cap is off and render
scale is set to 100% or initially
getting a hundred and fifty to one
hundred and sixty frames per second here
on watch point your bolt Gibralter your
ball to Berger no I died
all right so pretty solid the looks like
in the 150 range on average maybe
dipping down into the 120s on occasion
I'm going to switch to 1080 now alright
we switch down to 1080 now and we've got
quite a few more frames so no worst case
scenario we're dipping down into the low
200s to tens to teens but most of the
time were above that just depends on how
many of junk grass explosions are going
on as well as other things
no junk rat what it dick
lb lost that's okay it's time to move on
and welcome to battlefield 5 before we
get swept up in the story we're at 2560
by 1440 we're at ultra settings DirectX
12 mode is on but currently DirectX ray
tracing is off this is the same level
I've been playing on so you should be
able to jump over to the 20 atti video
if you want to get a little bit of a
side-by-side again no DirectX
ray-tracing so we cannot see stuff
reflected in the puddles unless it's on
the screen as well currently getting in
the 70s frames per second wise so not
too shabby a 1440 here definitely a
playable framerate if you're looking for
about 60 frames per second on average
let's try turn and retracing on though
and now we're at 1440 with ray tracing
turned on let's see if this is at all
playable definitely has dips were in the
low 40s it's a little choppy oh they're
yelling the war war charge but I'm just
distracted by the beautiful reflections
and the pools here just so many
reflections all right so it's slightly
prettier but definitely not playable at
this framerate in my opinion we got to
have at least 60 and NVIDIA did tell us
that if we switch to 1080 with ray
tracing we should be able to get about
60 frames per second maybe a little less
so I've dropped down to 1080 ray tracing
is currently off and we're still in
DirectX 12 mode of course it's like
we're a hidden 100 FPS from time to time
and then dip and down into the high 80s
as well yeah run away run away coward
coward Nazi so a pretty good experience
here again 90 to 100 frames per seconds
is what we're getting and that's what's
ray tracing off we're told we can get 60
frames per second with ray tracing
turned on though so let's do that so now
we're at 1080 and ray tracing is on
let's see how it goes almost 60 fps
55:57
I am unstoppable okay maybe I am
stoppable 53 FPS stop running running
away from me so I can see why Nvidia
didn't say it's gonna hit 60 FPS we have
one more option leaving everything else
on ultra but we're gonna turn our
raytrace reflections quality just too
high let's see how it does it high it's
the same alright ray-tracing medium OOP
six think we have 60 hold on hold on let
me reload then I can shoot you it's very
realistic look at those 60 frames per
second again these for at least for a
moment
alright so it's very tracing medium
we're getting almost straight right
about 60 FPS we can probably turn some
other stuff down and get a playable
framerate as well but let's move on to
our final game time for some shadow of
the Tomb Raider we are starting off at
2560 by 1440
and I immediately died forgot that's
where we ended last time at sea tap see
okay
I was tapping see she was scrambling
that's not fair at all
I've got to hold it alright so in this
area at least we're getting right about
60 frames per second not too terrible Oh
jumped a little too far there I have
just switched over to 1920 by 1080 again
just to see what kind of frame rate
increasing brings to us oh that was
close
okay alright that's a little scary
jumping across there but it makes a
little bit easier now that I'm getting
90 to 100 frames per second versus
around 60 all right guys before this
gets too much more tense I think I must
call it I will say this is a fun game
and interesting game I wish I could play
a little bit more we got a call here
though at 1080 we're getting a very
solid 90 to 100 frames per second in
shadow of the Tomb Raider so those are
my game test guys hopefully that gives
you a better idea of what to expect if
you're thinking about forking over $350
for the new r-tx 2060 from Nvidia also I
have more CES coverage coming at you
very soon so don't forget to subscribe
hit the thumbs up button leave me a
comment in the comment section let me
know what stuff you'd like me to hit up
in Las Vegas I should be there by now I
hope it's not too terribly cold it's
definitely gonna be dry I should bring
chapstick and maybe some lotion for my
hands that'd be nice too but one more
last final thank you to my sponsors for
CES 2019 Coolermaster deep cool Corsair
and enter max thanks again for watching
guys
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
