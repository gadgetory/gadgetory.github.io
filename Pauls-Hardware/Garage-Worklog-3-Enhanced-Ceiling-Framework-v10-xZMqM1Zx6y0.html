Pauls hardware today I'm bringing you a
work log it's Saturday and I've been
working in my garage here all Saturday
the idea is that I'm going to be
transforming my sort of video making
area here into a bit more I want to say
professional studio or anything like
that but at least make it a bit more
purpose-built towards making videos to
that end I've been working on this this
framework that you see up mounted to the
ceiling I shouldn't say I because I was
fortunate enough that my uncle Balin was
over here today to help my wife and I
with our sink and when he saw that I was
working on this he's like hey let me
help you out and as you will probably
see in just a moment he did the lion's
share the work up here but I was there
to help and handing things from time to
time I gave him some water and stuff so
welcome below and if you're watching
this thank you so much for all of your
help today but to all the rest of you
guys we're going to jump back to this
morning
and you watch me and my uncle put all
this stuff up here behind me and then
also probably continue into what I have
to do for the rest of the evening which
is to sort of reassemble my work area
over there still have a state of flux
but we're moving we're moving forward
we're moving in the right direction but
thank you for watching this video and
don't forget to Like and subscribe and
all that good stuff and here it is my
Saturday Garage work log
you
you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
