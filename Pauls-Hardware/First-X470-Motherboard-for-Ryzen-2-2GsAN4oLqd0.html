Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool all
right guys I'm over at Caesars and we're
visiting gigabytes they have quite a few
things on display actually a lot of the
stuff has already been released but I
think I have a motherboard right here
that you might be interested in if you
watched my AMD video you know that Rison
2 is coming coming very soon in April so
here I have the very first X 470
motherboard that I have laid hands upon
so let's take a closer look so here it
is and this is the Auris gaming 7 y 5
this is gonna be more towards the high
end of the gigabyte or as offerings when
it comes to this particular platform
still using the same AM for socket so
still backwards compatible with the
original rise in the lineup of
processors such as the 1800 X and the r5
1600 but the 2000 series the rise in
twos coming in April we'll also be able
to slot right into this motherboard now
what we're not 100% sure of yet is what
the performance difference is going to
be if at all when it comes to the raw
CPU performance will hopefully find out
more about that as we get closer to
launch but that aside we can see a very
nice set of features with this
motherboard first off when it comes to
power delivery especially for
overclocking we're hoping and expecting
that the risings you processor since
they're going to be on a 12 nanometer
process instead of 40 nanometer might be
better overclockers and of course you're
going to need to provide plenty of juice
for that so you'll notice a very thin
dense array here of actual fins with
heat sinks below them to allow air to
pass through them for optimal heat
dissipation this is the type of thin
array for cooling of VRMs that we've
kind of been missing for a while but
it's good to see that it's coming back
as overclocking I don't want to say
maintains or becomes more popular but
this motherboard has a 10 plus 2 phase
power delivery configuration their IR or
international rectifier power delivery
components they're using in there it's
got a 8 pin and a 4 pin supplemental CPU
power connector we can see if Chris IR
for standard DIMM slots for ddr4 memory
and then in the upper rates you have a
few extra little buttons and stuff there
is an RGB W header for connecting up
your LED lights you get an OC button to
access some of the OC functions and you
also have a Messer
found a reset button there as well
looking down just below that we have a
couple switches one is to switch between
BIOS a and BIOS Padilla the other is to
switch between single BIOS and dual BIOS
mode we get a debug led you can see a
group of 4 pin PWM fan control or frame
connectors right there as well there's a
USB 3.1 gen2 connector on there the
updated version so that's always nice to
have and then down in the bottom right
you can see our SATA ports 6 of them are
is the standard here and one of them is
kind of busted this is a this is a
sample motherboard and it's been
manhandled quite a bit from what we can
tell so there are a couple aesthetic
problems such as some of the fins on the
heat sink if snapped off up there in the
top right as well as of course that SATA
port but don't worry if you actually get
one of these motherboards it's not gonna
not gonna have those issues they have
bumped you up to an additional MDOT 2
slot so you can see one that's up there
both the top GPU slaughter by 16 PCI
Express slot and then you've got another
one further down top one looks like you
go up to 110 lengths and this one is a
standard 20 to 80 they both have some
beefy looking heat sinks on there to
provide some additional heat dissipation
for your MDOT 2 drives and then down at
the bottom we can see pretty standard
configuration and layout for front panel
connectors USB and all that good stuff
on the back of the board we have a sort
of a backplate a quarter backplate a
quarter backplate I think I just made a
football reference I don't know what the
heck's going on but it's got a bit of an
orange accent on there and I'm guessing
provides a little bit of added
protection for the bottom of the
motherboard and then finally for IO here
we have a permanently attached IO shield
and these are becoming more and more
popular and more and more coming and I
really like it it's got a bit of a
reflective finish on there and then
since this is the Wi-Fi version we got a
couple of connection points there for
Wi-Fi antenna it's got an Intel Wi-Fi
card in there there are our surface
mounted power and BIOS reset buttons
here at the back I really like those as
a feature on a motherboard my my top 5
motherboard features video that's one of
the things that pointed out now we've
also got a fair amounts of a USB we got
a USB 3.1 gen2 and then we also have
these yellow ports and those are
specifically made for connecting up
external Dax they have very clean power
going to them to prevent any
interference say finally you got your
standard i/o for audio and an optical
Toslink out and that's pretty much wraps
it up but guys that's gonna wrap it up
for this video and my first ever look at
the new generation of motherboards for
AMD risin and risin two processors again
coming out in April and gigabyte said
that they're going to match AMD's launch
so when AMD launches rising 2 gigabyte
will also launch the new series of
motherboards and of course there's going
to be other other x4 70 motherboards
besides just this one but guys thank you
so much for watching this video hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
of course a final thank you to my
sponsors for CES 2018 ocz toshiba deep
cool cooler master and enter max thanks
for watching and we'll see you in the
next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
