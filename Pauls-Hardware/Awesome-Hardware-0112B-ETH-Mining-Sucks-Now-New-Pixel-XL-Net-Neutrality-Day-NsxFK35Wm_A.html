surrett insightful comments about
technology you've ever thought you've
heard until now or forever oh I forgot
to increase a bit rate you can't write
that kind of was the best until
completely wrong settings
looks like horror movies too late it's
totally too late now - it was good
don't judge us too harshly fix it next
week streaming settings will come next
week really horrible alright so um hey I
have to cut both streams when we start
if we're gonna sit we're already late
you're right ready it's a 730 Aires
130ft
yes yes yes it's no it's still 60fps
here you're getting 60 frames per second
can't they can't choose you're just
getting half of the amount of data in
each frame yeah you would have gotten
otherwise there's no xxx yes like I
don't think you can say which okay does
I know you to automatically I don't
think you can do that on youtube by
there so okay yeah
hey everyone though welcome welcome to
awesome hardware a live show about
technology probably the best technology
show even though we're not good at
technology we do it every Tuesday
evening 5:30 p.m. Pacific time this is
episode number 112 and we actually
already have been streaming for well
over an hour the first half of episode
112 was on Kyle's channel which is
called bigwig
bring your note cards have no cuts fine
we're fine first half was on Kyle's
channel which is bit with link is in the
description and that was the sober house
so click on that if you're interested
also we do drink a few drinks of the
beer and alcohol enabled variety here on
the show why is there still I'm pouring
it very slowly so that it's the perfect
amount of head
we drink a few beers giving you really
good we may curse and use foul language
to bear that in mind if you were if
you're young and easily offended sorry
about that and yes when I was supposed
to do before we started streaming was
fixed a bit rate because the bitrate on
the the streaming software we use xsplit
is still set to the default which is
ideally set up for like a 1080 30 stream
we're streaming at 60 frames per second
because my camera is capturing at 60
frames per second fancy new capture
system with a 69 50x in it wait yeah it
continues can we drop it continually
continues can't just let the little
green man go every time we take a drink
we have to take the little green man off
the drink before we drink then - sips
for me because I forgot and then put him
back on all right
this shows already all over the place so
I don't blame any of you guys have you
have stopped watching we're gonna talk
about etherium mining today because it
sucks now depending on on who you are
and how reactive you are what drives
like tanked and price or some luck Xu
Asians in the marketplace we'll get to
that we'll get to that
okay I'm teasing you Jesus oh you just
talk to your teeth we're going to talk a
little bit about net neutrality because
there's a day of action going on
tomorrow and we'll be explaining that a
little bit to you and talking about some
of the variables they're not seriously
though please don't please don't assume
this is some sort of serious show or
serious show and assume that we take not
at all seriously and then we'll be
talking about Intel because until
continues to suck recently there's no
other way to describe it really but look
in a bad way yeah let's dive into our
first segments though continuing from
the first half which is the continuation
of tech news but actually no never mind
never mind about that
first off if you want to buy stuff in
our stores check that out pulsar we're
not net Pulsar we're dotnet is my store
shirts mugs and PEG glasses all good
stuff buy it during the show we'll give
you a shout out at the end of the show
same with scale store which is bit wit
dot tech slash store he also has shirts
mugs pint glasses
all good stuff bye-bye things all right
back to news first article this is from
tweek town this one was written by none
other than our good friend Anthony over
its week down hey friend of the show
Johnson to you in a theory of mining is
dead we've been talking about a theory
of mining a lot in the past I don't know
a month or so since graphics card prices
have gone through the roof it's been
very difficult to buy a GPU especially
if you're looking at anything in the
mid-range because people have been using
them for cryptocurrency mining most
significantly aetherium mining because
it's a good way to make some money it
was by a graphics card for 250 bucks you
spend a couple months mining with it pay
off your graphics cards price and then
all the money you get from mining after
that is profit your Brahman Anthony
Anthony's done a lot of mining I know
he's got a he's got a bit of a farm
going he shared some pictures of it via
it's week 10 articles as well as on
Facebook and whatnots however there's a
pretty big fluctuation in the market
just in the past 24 hours and you can
tell this is serious because it's at
week 10 article and there's multiple
pages look at this wait why don't they
never do multiple pages it's like
serious all right
apparently I can't click on the drop
down but there's multiple pages it's a
four-page article and yeah sorry in the
last 72 hours the difficulty of mining
aetherium has increased pretty
significantly there's some areas
highlighted here this is the increase in
difficulty of mining aetherium because
it gets more difficult to mine the more
people - the price as a result has
dropped to a two-month low and what
we're specifically talking about here is
the Dagg increase so this this is time
time in the bottom and the dag increases
over here on the right and dag increases
the level of difficulty that it
that it takes two minor theorem hold on
I'm going to close this bag stand for
thank you for cueing me Kyle dag stands
for directed a silic graph and aetherium
a dag is created every epic epoch epoch
every epoch uses a combination of
algorithms the algorithm is that kind of
the make the make up the basis of
aetherium and then a new dad comes out
and the bigger the dag is from my
understanding the more of the GPU memory
it uses up so the more difficult it
makes it for for the GPUs to mine and
please bear in mind that I haven't done
much mining myself most of what I'm
talking about here is from reading
articles and everything like that so if
you guys are hardcore miners and you
feel like what we're saying is not
exactly accurate I'm sorry but there's
nothing we can do about it anyway um the
dag has increased in waves throughout
the first week of July and then and then
there was a massive mountain like
increase on July 11th you can see the
chart sort of ramps up right here to 1.2
T and I don't know what 1.2 I have no
idea what 1.2 T means it's not terabytes
I don't think but I believe it is the
size grants of the dag I don't know it
beats me this is why I prefaced this was
by the way we might have no idea what
we're talking about also we've been
tricking that makes everything okay so
Anthony because he's super into this was
following this very closely in the past
24 hours followed it as it bottomed out
to the lowest price of one hundred and
eighty three dollars and 39 cents and
actually I have the current charts
written right here on Coyne desk and
this is this is this is up-to-date to
the minute right now so here's where it
started to drop off so this is the 11th
of July you'll notice it actually hit a
pretty low point here 1 96 97 there was
a massive increase in the difficulty of
mining and then it started to just fall
off really really
really significantly here over the past
day bottomed out at about 183 39 but
then it read back up right here so
remember that it jumped back up right
here as you read Anthony's article
because it makes it kind of funny price
jobs below 180 dollars us us on page
four he points out that all crypto
currencies are down not just I'm Gary
him I'm sorry I'm getting a call from
our good friend and moderator Nick are
still processing what's up dude why
what's gone Oh is my oh your videos I'm
listed to your right it is
Thank You Nick got it thank you very
much so thank you so you're right that
probably makes it more challenging for
people to watch it's right here sorry I
suck it's public now let's build another
computer like right now right now build
me like beer if I get another one just
use the share have it building more
computers that he has used for it okay
and then even a human even might even
2.0 my brother-in-law who's an avid
watch of our show just texted me now
Paul isn't streaming to YouTube right
now just FYI so yeah I am streaming to
YouTube it was just a privately now said
a public yeah you were now it's been
updated now now the world knows and that
more people should be able to watch so
say thank you so many times
thank you sell and yeah this is again
another episode where we're relying a
lot on blaming the fact that we've been
drinking and I'm gonna yep hey that's
right so that means the only people who
have been really watching have been the
truth I advanced the only ones that have
fans yep follow some Twitter screw the
rest to get the links and all that good
stuff okay alright let's go back to
making fun Anthony you know Anthony
points out here that all digital
currency is hurting
and again this is this article he wrote
was about 12 hours ago maybe 12 to 18
hours ago when I actually posted up
there here's a look at currents all
digital currency this is on quayne
market capcom and this actually is not
like false buy any any in any way shape
or form everything is down look at the
seven-day look at the 24 hour look at
the 1-hour everything is down there's a
couple there's a couple that are
maintaining you know to some degree a
level of improvement but there's a lot
of red on this chart there's a lot of
red going on so there's certainly
something going on in the wider markets
when it comes to cryptocurrency in
general and it's difficult to pinpoint
what exactly the cause happens to be if
you're Anthony though the world is
coming to an end I'm saying I'm making
I'm making and poking I'm hoping Anthony
watches this because he's really not
that reactive but I'm page 4 of his
article he notes that all currencies are
down on page 5 he despairs he says what
to see what to expect this week he says
bear in mind he also titled his article
the theory of mining is dead so
everything is hitting a new low and and
you know right now it's it bottomed out
it out for him at like 1 185 ish could
we see below 150 in the next few days
what about below 100 I feel like that's
not a huge drop though from what what
about below 50 from 220 to 180 we gotta
remember the peak was 400 bucks about
400 bucks is where it ok max that at at
least in the past couple months when it
comes to when it was the most profitable
can you mono can you mine multiple
crypto currencies at once
yes system in fact in fact there's I
don't know the name of it off the top of
my head but there are mining
applications you can get that will just
according to what the mining application
thinks a mine whatever currency is gonna
get you the most money at the time so
that's
you can do you know there's lots of ways
that you can hold that cryptocurrency
mine at least hopefully then his
whatever system he's got set up
hopefully just switched over to the next
highest paying yeah thing which seems to
be Bitcoin will obviously bitcoins in
number one oh yeah Bitcoin the value has
been number one for quite some time just
because yeah it's valued so high but
there's other ways of sorting this as
well that you can look at so Bitcoin and
aetherium are pretty high if they're in
right now as if the filming of this is
$189 and 84 why is Ripple number three
when it's only point one seven dollars
because right now this is being sorted
by I don't know what this is being
sorted by circulating supply oh wait I
don't know I don't know how this is
being sorted it's just number right here
yeah a coin market Capcom I'm not sure
how they how they sort these and how
they determine and oh they're looking at
market cap that's what they're looking
at so depending on the number of coins
that are out there on the market and the
value of the coins of the market equals
the market cap so Bitcoin has the
highest market cap at 37 billion dollars
right it theory amiss at 17 billion
dollars ripples at six billion dollars
we're gonna circulate in supply even
though the price per ripple but I mean
that's out of 38 what was it billion I
mean cryptocurrencies are developed by
people and they operate in different
ways so this one is clearly operating in
a certain in a way that the amount of
mining that you do gets you a coin at a
faster rate than than the other
currencies so yeah it's it's all
relative I guess is what I'm trying to
say anyway though let's move on so yeah
point being here the regardless of the
pricing changes and fluctuations of
aetherium which can be very volatile the
difficulty increase remains the same so
it is now more challenging to - theorem
so the amount of money that you invest
in getting an rx 580 or an RX 570 are
480 or whatever using - mine is now less
valuable than it was
for because the amount of that work that
that GPU can do to get a coin is now
more than it was before
because more people have been mining and
that's just sort of the ITER ative way
that's cryptocurrencies work it gets
more challenging the more people - so
who knows how that so this is all gonna
play out we don't know we don't know how
long the current cryptocurrency mining
craze is going to last hopefully at some
point it drops off and there's a lot of
GPUs on the market - people can buy for
pretty low prices at least if you're
looking at it from the perspective of a
PC gamer yep all right the next pixel
excel was sort of a bit of a buzz day
about this this article is actually from
the verge originally though it was
Android police who broke this and it's
basically a picture of what we can
relatively reasonably presume is the
next pixel exactly compared to mine
there it is all mines own on Excel but
still more or less I mean I have the
excel so I can give you guys a
side-by-side Android police according to
the verge has a very strong track record
when it comes to releasing early
information about smartphones but there
is a chance this might not be the
finalized design of the pixel Excel 2017
or pixel - Excel or whatever the hell
they decide to call it it does appear to
be taller at 6 inches tall and it is
slimmer so it's not quite as wide it has
a two-to-one aspect ratio for the
display like the LG G 6 and it seems to
have only one lens here on the back if
you look at the new dual camera so they
had not the dual camera configuration
although the lens assembly does also
seem to be larger I don't know what we
can do what seems to be larger the lens
assembly like if you look at the actual
it's kind of so yeah I forgot my yep
it's my tiny thing in the corner there
is my pixel XL and you can see the
cameras are up here I'm sorry up here is
my pixel non XL you'll also note that
the glass part of this comes down to
below where the fingerprint reader is
where
as if you look at this picture the glass
comes down not quite as far I think I
print readers below it I'm okay with
that
what's the glass I saw at least a few
pictures people where they has a glass
panel on the back shattered and I'm due
to a trap or something like that so
that's a bear in mind there's a
watermark on this so this isn't
something that's like embedded into the
the finish on the back or anything like
that's it this does seem to be probably
an aluminum casing on the back here it
looks just like it's got kind of a
rounded edge here along the side the
bezels are definitely smaller I don't
like that it doesn't seem like there's
front facing speakers on it it's
definitely the thing I would have liked
to have the most on the pixel the
speaker is positional and you always
have to have it kind of kept in your
hands to get good sound out of it and
it's just not the greatest what else
what else about this yeah I heard there
were like squeezable sides is that a
thing not sure about that okay yeah I
don't even know these these look like
fairly standard buttons on the side are
you talking oh I totally forgot to bring
it up the the red the red cell phone is
that what you're talking about with the
finger baby finger grips yeah maybe yeah
sorry we forgot to I forgot to add that
to today's list of things to talk about
there was a red camera about a week ago
was announced there's only a couple
pictures of it marques Brownlee did a
video I yeah you guys can should watch
that we'll do a much better job of
explaining it to me well yeah so yeah
all in all the pixel XL I mean
design-wise
looks looks pretty clean Oh maybe or
maybe nice we're talking about the HTC
eleven has squeezable side of you eleven
I'm not sure I haven't heard of that one
the you eleven you know the red phone
yes is what we were talking about yeah
that's the thing yeah we don't have that
listed on today's actual discussion from
my understanding it was mainly just that
picture but I don't know if there was
more information that came out it on it
in the past few days and I have not
researched it directly I'm pretty happy
with my pixel I really like my pixel as
well so I don't think I'll feel super
outdated when the pixel to Excel or non
Excel comes out I might get it to make a
video on it but I don't know
yeah I'm still on the fence about the
videos on phones they're kind of hit or
miss yeah I mean cuz cuz I don't do them
that often so people don't look for them
from me right so true yeah YouTube
probably sees it too like you're a PC
guy exactly no one's gonna watch your
stupid mobile push your video alright I
have a strap hold that I'm linking in
chat right now it goes along with this
story so if you guys are interested did
you post in both iridium in yeah I
pushed the both so should be good so go
ahead and vote on that if you if you
want the oculus has cut I'm sorry oculus
heads cut to the price of the rift again
for the second time this year 399
dollars not including the oculus touch
pads that's being demonstrated by this
this picture here with the student noise
yeah so I goes did a vlog overnight last
night's Rifkin touch for two bucks but
my my question that I'm asking you guys
to answer is you know VR VR hasn't
exactly taken off there's you know it's
it's niche still for sure but there's
still speculation that it might take off
and what are the barriers to it taking
off so my question for you guys is now
that this is 400 bucks do you think that
VR might take off a little bit more with
a lower cost to entry this is for a
limited time it's part of the summer of
rift promotion that oculus is doing it
also includes discounts on oculus games
there was speculation about this that
there is some sort of problem or you
know some issue that they're trans have
workaround like oh we need more
and sales haven't been good so we need
to cut the price so that we sell more of
them or whatever
oculus said no that's not the case we
were just waiting to drop the price
until we had more games out there so
that there were more options for people
to play when they actually got an oculus
rift so maybe that's true maybe it's not
in any case this price will be available
for six weeks so roughly five six weeks
from now if you're interested so it's
not like you need to buy it right now if
you want to get this price but it
doesn't seem like it's gonna stay this
much also might have something to do
with the potential launch of an oculus
rift - there's no further information on
that it's just speculation based on a
lot of discussion
like when rift first launched and
there's speculation on how long they
thought the rift is a platform would
actually last and everything now this is
a pretty significant price drop for
something like this as far as a specific
niche gaming product the article from
the verge compares it to video game
consoles which usually take a little bit
longer before prices drop off especially
something like this which is a 50% price
reduction over the initial cost of the
rift which was 600 bucks
they said video game consoles usually
take an average of three to four years
before this much of a before you see
this much of a price drop right whereas
with the rift it's been more like a year
yeah
when did it actually launch yeah it's
about a year it's July now they're
supposed to launch earlier last year and
it didn't and it was delayed and most
yeah yeah better year ago I don't
remember when it actually came out but
right anyway yeah I guess let's see what
you guys think about this one we haven't
given you a ton of time but your anytime
you're all quickly yeah everyone so
snappy very you got a couple hundred
people who have voted but yeah so it
does seem like there is interest in VR
it's just that that barrier to entry is
it's pretty significant you needed to
spend probably about fifteen hundred
bucks to get a viable VR system up
running if you're talking about the cost
of the computer that's the as well as
the headset yeah so even not even just
the money I think it's just the fact
that like the date like where we live
like right now like the society we live
in there are not many high-end gaming or
even like desktops like not many
households have desktops in them like
they used to like like a gaming system
with the recently paragrafix was very
neat desktop I feel like the average
household in America now like doesn't
even know what a desktop is like it's
although they have a desktop but it's
like over in the corner and no one's
used it for a couple of years because
yeah that's like five it's like five ten
years old and they're all on their
tablets their smartphones you know it or
laptops and so I feel like that's the
biggest barrier to entry not just not
just the price of a desktop but just the
fact that people have to now seek out
buying a desktop and then most likely
it's gonna be a prebuilt for them
they're not gonna like build their own
most people again are not gonna build
their own system just for VR they're
probably gonna buy a prebuilt but
they're not gonna know where to look
they're gonna be like well what kind of
specs do I need what are the minimum
requirements what does that even look
like what all these numbers and model
SKUs mean I feel like that's like the
hugest barrier to entry and I just
pulled up an article just like didn't
take me much time to find it at all
Sony's psvr the PS the PlayStation VR
has nearly quadrupled vive sales in q1
20:17 according to super data which just
kind of reaffirms this this fact that
like psvr is taking off way more than
vias even though the functionality and
like the games offered might not be
nearly as innovative as what's offered
on vibe simply because people at this
point are just so much more in tune with
like a gaming console than they are a
DIY or pre-built desktop PC like desktop
PCs are really like it's ironic too
because desktop PCs are like the cream
of the crop when it comes to
technological advancement in terms of
graphic fidelity and just smooth
gameplay but at the same time it's like
the elite it's like the most underground
niche in like technological society like
everyone's just gaming on like a xbox
one
ever and waiting for the VR to introduce
itself on a game console rather than
them seeking out a desktop - to get a
higher experience maybe I'm just talking
out of my ass completely right now
because I probably have been no I mean
that's that's a significantly higher
uptake in sales on Drupal and that's
insane and think about all the the news
articles that we come by like just on a
daily basis how many of them are about
psvr versus five like they're all more
at more or less about live in oculus
because that's gonna give you the most
of the time the better experience but
yet the sales say otherwise because
people are so familiarized with consoles
already and it's just easier to buy psvr
oh it just works with this console that
I already have as opposed to trying to
figure out what sort of desktop PC
I haven't owned a desktop PC in 10 years
how didn't even know these things still
existed like that's yeah I think the
hardest thing to wrap your mind around
is that there are so many gamers out
there in our country that that are not
PC literate at all like we think of
gamers like when we think of gamers like
we think of like a PC enthusiast who
knows their shape he knows how to build
their own system most gamers are have no
idea about when it comes to PC desktops
they're on consoles they're on handhelds
for me that's for me that's that's ok no
that's totally ok cuz like in it I'm a
singer I'm ok with the PC being niche as
long as it is still big enough to get
enough sales that you know they keep
making graphics cards gaming GPUs and
everything like that mm-hmm
and it's just sort of that you know
there's there's people who love to play
games and if they get to the point where
they're playing games on a console or
something like that and then I start
they hear something about like oh you
know I just got my psvr and like oh well
actually the first VR thing was it was a
vibe or whatever like that and they're
like oh there's this other option out
there that has high resolution and
you know can play at a higher frame
rates and has other capabilities and a
wider library of games that are
available you know that's just sort of
that introduction into gaming on the PC
that I think people can get excited
about so this for me is good news
because it means that VR is not
something that people were like oh flash
in the pan like you know it was
something that happened and I Cal VR
like it just it was just kind of like
got over it pretty quickly it's
something that people are interested in
it's just something that needs to be
made a little bit more easy to access
for people who don't have 1500 bucks to
spend on a gaming PC and VR system the
point of the article made about this in
particular was that you can feasibly get
somewhat bare-bones ish but you can
feasibly get a VR system up and running
for closer to a thousand dollars now
yeah with this price fear as opposed to
like fourteen fifteen hundred bucks plus
that you'd have to spend a little bit on
before but you know as GPU prices
hopefully come down and also hopefully
the prices of the headsets which you can
definitely expect that they come out
with second generations of the headsets
at some point then yeah that's exciting
yeah right I have I have to switch
something really quick this isn't
face-off
I gotta update this I meant to update
this before we started
what's the name of that VR technology
where it only renders the pixels you're
looking at and it says off to the
other ones around it what's the pulled
again you know what I'm talking about
though yeah I know what you're talking
about I don't don't remember the name of
it chat please help me out for some
reason I was like thinking about that
and I'm like what's it called Oh like
foliation or no Felicia yes is Felician
it's not Felician halation something
similar to that though it's an nvidia
thing I'm crazy I have like a bunch of
Nvidia PDFs that they've sent me with
their marketing stuff and I bet it's um
one of those yeah Feliciano Feliciano
vrdr fellatio yes okay thanks for net
watch yes it is a segment where we talk
about the internet affiliate it and
watch ated fo v ated ob ated i think
you're a movi ated rendering so v8 and
rendering god alright thank god
fellatio rendering I see how someone's
own fellatio survived so the shark I was
in the same ball comes at least in the
same ballpark
Bovie aided rendering the more you know
okay there it is there it is people know
more things in the memberid know it all
right carry on Paula okay
the e FF the Electronic Frontier
Foundation has released their who has
your back list Alyssa they've been doing
for a few years now which basically
talks about and I'm sorry it analyzes
and evaluates how companies deal with
user data when government entities come
seeking it if you want to be private
online and you want to deal with
companies who will respect your privacy
yes then this list perhaps is something
you should be looking at couldn't you
just get into VPN what a VPN work
essentially the same no okay no
because it doesn't matter if you use the
VPN to access Amazon you gave em as on
your information and if the government
says hey Amazon what's the information
of that guy who bought that thing and
they give you their information doesn't
matter when they get used I guess you're
right so yeah that's not really
concerned um anyway the full list the
full list is here it's also linked in
the video's description or on e FF dot
org and who has your back
government data request for 2017 the top
rating companies for 2017 include Adobe
you can see at the top here five stars
misters across the entire thing as well
as credo mobile Dropbox lyft Pinterest
sonic uber wicker and WordPress lips got
five of five stars here where's uber
uber also got five of five stars here so
you can look across the whole list
that's fairly easy to check out ATT
Comcast of course Wow yes surprisingly
shooting lowest rated companies
companies have got a one star where
Comcast AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Verizon what
do you know the four major Internet
service providers would have expected
the companies that have like the worst
customer feedback ratings in the United
States happen to also get one star
ratings on here as you're days I think
privacy even t-mobile who's like we're
t-mobile and we're different and be like
feathers no you're the same same bullsh
I'm surprised that Facebook has such a
high rise in four out of five yeah
Facebook has improved I think since they
started doing this list actually so yeah
I'm cool with that Comcast AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile
Verizon got one star Amazon and whatsapp
got two stars so all you guys who are
like Amazon Prime danbad someday what do
you think of them with with your privacy
information a new category that was
added this year is stands up to NSL gag
orders which are the National Security
Letters which if they're presented to
accompany basically mean that companies
being forced to hand over data to the
government and there's a built-in gag
which means the company can't even
publicly say hey by the way our
information was just sent over to the
government because they asked for it
they can't even tell people that it's
even been requested hmm so whether or
not people comply with that or the
businesses comply that that is one of
the stars on this list as well as
following industry-wide best practices
telling users about government data
requests promising not to sell out users
or just having some sort of written
thing that says hey people who use our
service we're not going to sell you out
it's good to have standing up to the NSL
gag orders of course and per-user public
policy and reform 702 and if you click
the link of this video's description
that goes to this page you can click on
those links in them to read a little bit
more information about them for now
though let's move on net neutrality big
issue right now we've been talking about
it pretty regularly on the live show and
just want to say that it is a big deal
and tomorrow is July 12th and net
neutrality has a day of action and AT&amp;amp;T
is joining in what do you think AT&amp;amp;T
joins the net new taut neutrality Pro
despite suing to block nature yes
despite despite that I don't food the
FCC in the past to attempt to block net
neutrality rules AT&amp;amp;T is attempting to
tell people yeah we're part of this too
and then we are in favor of preserving
and advancing an open Internet but their
idea of what an open Internet is very
different than perhaps what your idea of
an open Internet is so here's the
situation right now the FCC has situated
Internet service providers so that they
are classified as common carriers under
title 2 of the Telecommunications Act of
1930 1934 which allows the FCC to
enforce net neutrality it is because of
that classification that the FCC can say
hey you can't throttle this website or
tell them that they don't have access
you can't slow down Netflix because
you've determined that Netflix
just using up too much of the data if
you promise your customers that they
have this amount of bandwidth for data
you can't suddenly say like hey you're
actually using that so we're gonna
throttle you or throttle this website
that's using that you're accessing
that's using too much of that data yeah
they should just provide you with the
amount of bandwidth that you pay for
Internet service providers like AT&amp;amp;T are
like hey we're down with net neutrality
we don't think that there should be
throttling of different websites or
something like that but they're not
really standing behind their statements
because what the FCC is trying to do
right now is roll back the protections
that people currently have that are
currently in place a TNC when they were
first put in place in 2015 when they
first classified ISPs as title to common
carrier carriers AT&amp;amp;T sued them
obviously they were against this so
where whereas AT&amp;amp;T as well as a sheet PI
and the FCC will say we're in favor of
net neutrality they need to actually put
their money where their mouth is and
have some sort of plan in place to
enforce this because what they're
talking about right now is removing the
rules that allow the FCC to enforce it
but there's nothing that's being
presented is like and instead here's the
thing that all the ISPs will sign this
promises not to be assholes or whatever
like that they're not even doing
anything like that yeah all this thing
it's like there shouldn't be regulation
in whatever like that and if you're in
the position where you think we'll like
regulations are bad or whatever I'm just
like if what happened in 2014 and I bet
I bet I could pull it up right now but
in 2014 because Netflix had become so
popular I asked bees lo and behold and
suddenly started throttling them and and
and yeah it sucked I'm trying
there's a specific thing I'm gonna try
to find ur it now so I mean what I'm
wondering is does AT&amp;amp;T using this as
sort of like a marketing a marketing
thing like yearning me like they're
trying to pretend like they're on our
side when really they have ulterior
motives and they're just as corrupt and
evil as the other ISPs yeah
but they're trying to pretend like
they're one of us to get to get either
gain or trust or you know it seems like
a marketing stunt to me because it
really is not there it is in their best
interest
sorry this isn't neutrality so the
oatmeal the oatmeal dot-com slash blog
slash Net underscore neutrality has a
nice comic where he goes over this whole
thing he specifically did this as a
response to something Ted Cruz said but
this very clearly also shows what
happens in 2014 as all of the major ISPs
18t Verizon all started to throttle
Comcast's providers as well Comcast as a
black line right here Netflix service
suddenly started to tank across the
board this is direct action by Internet
service providers doing something that
requires net neutrality to prevent it
happening if you don't want Internet
service providers to be able to do this
for your connection to Netflix or
whatever other high you know whatever
the service you connect to that happens
to use a lot of data that your SP sounds
like hold on that data that we promised
that you paid for
suddenly we don't want to provide you
anymore because you're actually using it
if you don't want that to be able to
happen the net neutrality is the means
by which the FCC can prevent internet
service providers from doing that so hmm
yeah sketchy man all that is to say oh
no I just I just closed just close to my
next story instead of there were a
couple of providers up there that did
not
throw out all the speeds in that
instance though yeah cool
seven their
yeah is there I mean we're talking
bustle we're mainly talking about the
large Internet service providers that
have enough customers and enough
monopolies in a lot of areas to
basically throw their weight around and
do whatever they want to make as much
money as they possibly can okay going
back to the day of action which is
happening tomorrow
has now been joined by Google and
Facebook javis tech giant's yes so
they're now giving the net neutrality
campaign tomorrow a boost Google and
Facebook have not released any details
as to how there will be supporting this
but I would assume that would you go to
the home page there might be some
information there oh yeah a little green
man sorry thanks Chad and just for any
of you guys who are may be acting as
disseminators of information if you have
any family members who aren't familiar
with this and tomorrow see some message
on their favorite website and they come
to you and they're like hey this website
I just went to that I love has this
message about net neutrality and I don't
know what the heck they're talking about
explain it to them this is what the day
of action is about tomorrow is spreading
this information and it means that
people can understand and hopefully it
means that phrases in such a way that
people know that what really is in the
best interest of everyone is that
there's neutral communication between
different internet that we all have
different and we all have a website this
pornhub
that everyone has access to port that
really is what it boils down to if you
want to put it in the simplest terms to
someone who wants to understand that
neutrality you'd be like like pornhub
yeah well imagine not having that
anymore that sounds shitty what
if you're interested Ryder partnered
with a really crappy porn website and
yeah like hey we only want people to
access that porn website now because
every time people go to that porn
website yeah we get a bit of advertising
money so we're gonna slow down all the
other porn website
yep so the people only really have the
most incentive to go to that porn
website but on that porn website all
they've got is like you like Grandma
porn you only have touched her yeah they
just like you know short shorthand you
on the clips like all the clips are like
three minutes long it's like lemonparty
like times a thousand yeah going on
there and like who's interested in that
like I'm gonna I'm gonna head come right
when the videos ending who wants that
nobody no one so yes not my world
tomorrow there will be lots of people
asking questions about why websites they
go to have special information on them
about net neutrality hopefully you guys
if you're asked questions can help
answer them this is reminiscent of the
day in 2012 when the tech industry
rebelled against the copyright bill
known as SOPA and they altered and
blacked out their web sites to help
spread information and knowledge about
it there's also a chance that a popular
outcry could leak Congress or the White
House to put pressure on a GTI and the
FCC to reconsider the plan on net
neutrality and yeah hopefully Kyle
you're the hero we deserve great that's
a great way to describe things so yeah
shouldn't be allowed to streaming help
support that guys thanks to all you have
listened to us about it but um I think
information is really important and I
think free access to the information is
incredibly important
porn is information and if you want to
put it in terms where it's where porn is
what speaks you that's cool I think
there's a I think there's a larger
conversation beyond that as well but it
all depends on who you're talking to and
the best way to get your point across so
however that happens to be trending
trying to cater to our audience Paul no
I agree you're probably doing a better
job that I have for sure but all right
let's move we believe in you checked we
love you
another segment which is gonna be hot
and heavy hardware yeah this is a
special edition of hot and heavy
hardware intelligent intelligent and I
want to say this is like this sort of
neck
of hot and heavy header cuz we're
literally talking about hardware that is
too hot but yeah overheating Edition but
before we get it specifically into X 299
since that's what I was referring
referencing there the Intel Pentium G 45
60 is a good CPU I've recommended it
I imagine you maybe have as well which
one the G 45 60 it is a Pentium CPU yep
look here's the gamers Nexus has done
extensive yeah testing on this chip it's
only got two scores alright three killer
yeah well they got two cores but some
intel has with the Pentiums in the past
couple lineups actually introduced hyper
threading so it's got hyper threading so
two cores four threads three Meg's of l3
cache up from to 3.5 gigahertz frequency
KB Lake CPU architecture and $64 so
cheap why not so very easy to recommend
CPU for people who are building a budget
system yeah intel has decided it sucks
and they don't like what it's because it
maybe with themselves because it can be
with their i3 processors which cost
costs more money so why would anyone buy
an i at three processor when they can
get 8:45 64 64 bucks
the price to performance is really
significantly skewed when you go up to
the i3 level so Intel seeing that they
have a popular process of the people
like and are interested in buying and
has a good price to performance metric
has decided to limit the production of
that CPU no yes of course
what else could you possibly do kyle
scale down production of the g 45 60
this is according to a report on digi
worthy by the way so it's their fault if
it's wrong scaling down production of a
cpu like this would probably potentially
I don't know for sure because I can't
predict the future but knowing how
economics work lead to pricing increases
lead to the lack of availability of that
processor potentially
so the gravy train ride that was the
4560 that you can get for about 65 bucks
apparently is over no the cheapest I
three that you can get as a replacement
is the I three 7100 cost almost twice as
much at one hundred and seventeen
dollars and has basically the same chip
just friends a 3.9 gigahertz instead of
3.5 gigahertz so you're getting a couple
has a Cu one hundred megahertz higher
clock speed that's it yeah for double
price for for roughly double the price
yes that sounds unreason that sounds
pretty stupid I'm gonna go with the $64
CPU well you would if you could buy it
but apparently they're not gonna be
available anymore and that's a poor
decision on Intel's part at least that's
my opinion let's continue hot and heavy
hardware with the discussion all right
so let's I'm gonna make this a
compliment sandwich but in the reverse
sandwiches the compliments in the middle
and the crappy stuffs on the outside
forget the lows in the middle we have
this I nine 7900 X that has been
overclocked to six point zero one
gigahertz so yeah if you don't care too
much about racing it's a little bit
easier to get excited about the 7900 X
because it is a thousand-dollar
processor but it is very powerful it's
ten core CPU the world record was set by
Greek overclocker Sophos 1990 and as you
can see he used a pink hair dryer which
I think was pretty cool but yeah the 79
Hendrix was overclocked to 6.01
gigahertz on ln2 liquid-nitrogen
it scored twelve thousand one hundred
and eighty nine point five two and
hardware bots prime benchmark which is
the fastest ten core score in the world
it is also the fastest single CPU system
on that particular benchmark so it's
only been surpassed by dual CPU Riggs
probably Xeon based I would imagine to
achieve that frequency it had a V core
voltage of 1 point 6 volts which is
pretty high if you're not using on
something like Ellen 2 CPU multiplier
was at 59 and
Busbee was at 102 the Jeep I'm sorry the
other hardware that was used which you
can sort of see in this picture is the
gigabyte X 299 SOC champion motherboard
a kid of G scale Trident Z memory at 20
I'm sorry at 32 63 megahertz so also
overclocked a 120 gig coarser Neutron
SSD and of course her X 1500 eye power
supply all that's led to that overclock
and world records yay yay so given the
right configuration 700 X can be pretty
impressive but that's talking about a
hardcore overclock were using Ellen -
what about normal people
what about normal people's are just you
just get a 70 900 X and just plug it in
and just want to use it you might have
some challenges to deal with so I've
been looking pretty closely at X 299
because I've been trying to get to the
point where I can say well sure it's
overpriced and sure it doesn't make that
much sense for most people but it may be
it's still the fastest thing that's out
there and the fastest thing that's
available mm-hmm but maybe that that's
not always the case
any soon links in the description one is
for this article on Tom's Hardware just
posted yesterday by Igor wass elec UI
which is a four page article talking
about the current state of X 299 as well
as problems especially when it comes to
overclocking so they did some
significant amount of overclocking using
they were testing the temperature of the
vrm so the voltage regulators the power
delivery going to the system as well as
testing the CPU core temperature the
7900 X basically runs really hot even if
you have a decent a io like even it's
240 like a 240 millimeter all in one
column one cooler is like your baseline
for a 70 900 X and it can't even get
even I think about there JJ from asus is
like even like the big ass knocked to a
cooler like the air coolers from nock to
a like they stole a challenge old
rely on them because they're not gonna
cut it like so it's almost like you need
liquid cooling for something like this
yeah now this article I also believe is
a bit of a response for to their Bauer
Bauer who posted a little over a week
ago about the sort of X 299 vrm disaster
as he described it which was referring
specifically to attempting to overclock
on X 299 with a series of different
motherboards and the motherboards
basically having a wide array of
different reactions as far as the vrm
temperatures overclocking frequencies
they were able to hit temperatures of
the CPU as well and just general
instability and inconsistency of
performance across different boards yeah
between different boards and different
platforms no so the Thomas Hardware
article goes into some of that as far as
their testing configurations how the
setting up how they measuring stuff like
temperatures of the V RMS do you know it
like the sort of Delta was between like
the coolest running board and the
hottest running board in terms of erm or
CPU temps kind of know in a it's hard
it's hard to make a generic statement
about that and this article they're
using the MSI X 299 gaming Pro carbon AC
but it's so like when you're talking
about V RMS and the components in V RMS
they're often rated at much higher
temperatures they're rated actually to
run at temperatures up to like a hundred
and twenty-five C or something like that
right whereas these I believe the 1700
100x will start to throw out a lot about
95 C mm-hmm but the temperature
measurements for a lot of the power
delivery components are not taken on the
power delivery component itself there's
not a temperature sensor that's built
onto that component so the sensors are
placed on the PCB that might be right
next to the components right so it might
not be actually testing the center of
the component itself in might be getting
something that's similar today
and of course there's different
motherboards different implementations
of the power delivery that operate in
different ways as far as the article
goes they do specifically point out and
let me get to that second page they do
specifically point out in the second
page one of the big complaints that I
feel like has been across the board
about skylake X which is the thermal
interface material that they used
between the heat spreader and the CPU
itself and there's our there are charts
from their temperature testings when it
comes to the temperature of the heat
spreader they noticed that there was a
very significant glaring temperature
difference between the heat spreader on
top and the cores of the CPU underneath
which they attributed to a crappy
thermal interface material on the third
page rolled adding a little bit more
there's more details in these articles
you guys if you have more information
again linked in the description so I
encourage you to check them out
but yeah basically dependent sorry
here's a quote from the article
depending on whether you use enhanced
turbo option which is an option in the
Skydeck CPUs depending on where they use
that are not power consumption in excess
of 230 watts and a px heavy workloads
can happen or as high as 200 watts
without a VX right out of the box
without overclocking or anything like
that which is completely not in the
realm of what an air cooler can support
list of TDP of a 7970 900 X is 140 watts
so that's significantly out of the range
of what you would expect so even going
with the what you would expect to be
fairly conservative measurements from
Intel they are usually very conservative
out
conservative about this stuff is not
being supported by your typical air
cooler I have a 70 100 X with a master
air pro 4 on it right now and I'm pretty
sure when I'm actually putting it under
load that it is cause it's probably
throttling simply simply because it's
just an intercooler on
so I'm gonna take a closer look at that
soon I built that system kind of hastily
it's crazy now quickly the tides have
turned
we're like AMD was like the go to like
yeah you're over here you're an
overheating hot run and chip yeah that's
all pointing right and now it's totally
in tow like like all the rising
processors run super cool for the most
part like a lot of like especially like
this is 65 watt TDP parts it's like oh
my god you can get away that like the
included Wraith spire cooler on that and
on most of them and get away with like
the maximum overclock you could possibly
push on some of those skews whereas
Intel now is struggling to even be tamed
by the most high-end air coolers which
is quite quite interesting and it does
seem like if Intel had taken just a
little bit more time or invested a
little bit more and the materials go
into the construction of these CPUs if
they'd gone with something like a
soldered interface between the i HS HS
and the cpu core mmm they might be
dealing they wouldn't completely negate
these problems but it would certainly
help Sodor Bower is one of the ones who
first talked a lot about this about
green man sorry man cold out
my bad green man I'm done so I have
nothing to worry about
yeah boy there's no I'm good those are
empty I am not drinking it again
probably probably a good idea plenty
good soda bar first did his ex night ex
299 vrm disaster video which is here in
English he's done an update to that and
yeah basically he was working with
several people who looked at his
original video and we're trying to
replicate those those the scenario that
he set up that caused the V RMS to
overheat when overclocking on with
skylake X processors tiny Tom Logan from
the UK attempted to recreate those had
some difficulty with it
devourer worked with him they did a
collaboration video there's a couple
videos on both sides in this video
specifically devourer talks about the
situation or
the way he configured the test system in
order to create the situation that
caused the VRMs to overheat which was
nothing like crazy over the top or
anything like that and I apologize I
don't have all of my notes together for
this one this is where we ran out of
time as we were getting ready for the
show to start but he specifically
references certain things such as the
power switching states of the processors
and the fact that they might throttle so
quickly that certain software
applications like CPU Z might not catch
it hmm
also there's more in the video I I'd
like to say more details right now but I
think I'm really getting to the point
where if I attempted to go into it
further I might say things that were
completely incorrect we'll both just
show how much how little we know about
pretty much that's what I'm risking here
so yeah the Tom's Hardware article was
talking about how a lot of the blame at
the initial launch of this platform was
placed on motherboard manufacturers
because the CPU power delivery
configurations weren't up to snuff
I think what sort of leveled out here is
that there is definitely blame to be
placed on both sides cooling better of
the Viet having better cooling for the
VRMs would definitely have helped em
aside for example instead of doing their
plastic plates that cover that you can
customize with your name on it around
and if they did might have been better
invested in just making sure the VR
agency we're functionally dissipating as
much heat as they possibly could true
but there's definitely of course blame
on the Intel side as well or because
when it comes to overclocking in
particular there's just a lot of
variance between different motherboards
depending on like the current setting as
far as CPU power delivery goes if it's
at 100% you might not see the same
situation that debars
encountered but if you set it to one
hundred and thirty one hundred and forty
percent that's available in the
motherboard you have via UEFI that might
really cause that situation to have it
so again
could you guys check out those videos I
feel a little bit more detail on that
that's about as far as I could get today
I didn't have better notes on it I had
better notes on it and they went away
but that's alright we're getting we're
getting late it's getting late in the
day the point is screw X $2.99 you
should all just abandon it externally
nine is it's a challenge to sham it's
nobody I don't want to give up up on it
completely I feel like they're still
very unleash situations where it's a
where it's it still might be the best
but yeah but yeah it really sucks oh the
power delivery for the power deliver 4x
299 if it's just an 8 pin they were
testing some of the cables and finding
the cue that the cables could get really
hot because if you overclock in the
power draw it becames
becomes significant that can be an issue
so going with a power delivery system
that has at least eight plus four plant
four pin or eight plus eight pin
motherboard might be a better option for
you
all right which is also something that
we've discussed in the past me like it
doesn't matter because the CPU can never
actually pull that much but these CPUs
are actually seem to be getting more
towards that which is crazy especially
when you consider that we're only at the
ten core model that's out actually out
and available right now and Intel is
still supposed to be giving us 12 14 16
and 18 core options coming in the next
few months it's crazy to see how this
might actually still be viable on this
platform but if they're able to pull it
off that'll be somewhat impressive and
thread wrappers expected well thing is
expected at the end of this month I
don't know I don't know B I don't know
anything about that Rotarians shut up
alright that's all for my prepared
material for this episodes let's dive
into some quick Q&amp;amp;A we have some
questions that have been submitted with
some some donations so thanks to you
guys who have been supporting us in that
manner
we'll run
done that really quickly beautiful all
right first one we've got here is from
Fred ranch for $15 was wondering if you
did not want any money
oh well here's your share we'll be able
to share the $200 when you do the pie
challenge um we could I mean it was very
specifically like hey here's 200 bucks
Paulo scale 100 what will you call
remember then we'll remember that well
you could do is just do 100 h-half or
any Chavez is also fine works that way
we don't have to do it you can just
handle it that it makes it easier for us
but we do want to work that out
yeah money we like money we don't want
to turn anyone away no no no money he'll
be turned away MD 67 for the 20 bucks
love the show Paul even if you don't
stream it publicly hello well there's
$20 for a nice 6-pack of craft beer I
thank you Cheers that's my get us a
12-pack that's like the best six-pack
you could possibly buy you should like
they're a six-pack for more than 20
lawyers does not exist
Davy Chow people travel if I gotta leave
a child
holy but the Samsung the gs8 a
wireless charges and the VR headset with
it all $600 from prime date Tim can you
say VR porn oh you two are great be on
the Mia Wow
TV you you you are just too special I
feel like you're too much like when you
do that voices it's exactly what he had
in mind the whole time that is what I
imagine Phoebe sounds like like what if
we met DV in person one day like Anna
fan yet and he sounds exactly like oh I
was thinking you can say well it's just
like if that fat white dude you're he's
like that's good and I'm Phoebe damn TV
either way good look on your with your
VR headset hey Tina I thought I buck
does he give a device against gaming on
a 43 inch 4k TV also any news on the new
not to offense so to address the 4k TV
I wouldn't say against it I would very
much be interested if that
he has a gaming mode that is up
post-processing exactly limonade input
lag yep that'd be the best thing other
than that you're probably you're gonna
have a 4k probably 60 Hertz experience
yep
which isn't terrible wishes but ma'am
telephone a new knock to a fans I have
no information on that I've watched
several videos that people have covered
at Computex recently about the new knock
to us and I have nothing to comment
really small gap between the fan blades
in the housing yes yes
that's what we know blade housing gapper
Woodham Ulysses Lehrer
five dollar donation was here since the
beginning maybe maybe and we we
acknowledge that yeah we're proud
respect that here so kudos to you sir
thank you or madam SuperPi games SPG for
the 50 knock finally knocks dona was
back and really love you guys so it was
a Twitter link 4:30 a.m. Norway Twitter
comm not sure what that means
that's a Twitter link it looks like
you're really good Twitter length it's a
very long number at the end yeah long
the longer the number the more
interesting the link that's what I found
in my experience Thank You SuperPi
thanks sir
buffalo warrior $75 $75 for the five
cents had to battle I've had to battle
an unlisted video to donate Kyle
Oh Hein drops is a decent IPA but like
the get bent from Parkway out of Salem
Virginia try to find it pine drops tiny
drops this sound sounds good that's a
good name for a beer pine drops yeah
it's like it it dropped out at the trees
so get bent get bent from Parkway out of
Salem Virginia is also a good one I
should try get bent from Parkway I'll
try to remember that
thanks for the suggestion there Buffalo
Kodu dollars have you had any beer from
against the grain Brewing Company
against the grain brewing company never
heard of him
that's a good stuff that's a good Bad
Religion song though it's a good beard
Brewing Company in him too
it's against the grain get it cuz
they're dealing with grains like
wheat or the I guess that makes sense
there's a wordplay there Lukla Riv if
not looking over five dollars it's more
likely that we're projection on the
surface of an event horizon the inside
of the art totally agree couldn't agree
more
yes you're right that makes perfect
sense El Jefe reviews again for the ten
dollars I picked up as East z170 Maximus
eight hero one hundred and eighteen
dollars after mail-in rebate that's a
really good price and 16 gigs of Trinity
or GB ddr4 from new make sure they built
I five seventy six hundred K or I seven
seventy seven hundred K for 1080p gaming
and YouTube channel video editing I will
say if you're doing some hardcore video
editing you're doing that regularly the
i7 is nice because it is hyper threaded
and it's got four cores eight threads
I would even possibly consider Rison if
you're doing any sort of work station
applications whatsoever because you're
gonna be getting more threads and cores
as a result for either not much more
money or less money than what you can
get for an equivalent mainstream Intel
processor so check out check out maybe
like a sixteen hundred like an r5 1600
perhaps or even an hour seven 1700
that's that's what I've said in all my
recent videos like all my recent videos
like if you're just gaming is going into
but if you're doing anything else
besides gaming you just do rise that's
what I've said like it would be wrong of
me to go against that that opinion now
so that's what I'm gonna stick through
real quick point SuperPi game is cuz
he's he's going crazy and chat this was
a sweater Lincoln he has the wood case
it's a forty nine thirty k CPU at four
point five gigahertz city to Rama so
tech have extreme a 1080i custom loop
that's a cool that's cool case this is
that wood paneling fantex right I think
no NZXT what case is this
it looks like it looks like an NZXT I
feel like yeah I'd say NZXT like a
sandwich or something like that yeah I
don't know cool though
that's definitely wood panelled woody
nice case giving me a firm woody that's
for sure
all right next up we've got knowledge
right uh yes knowledge $77.77 brand a
pop quiz war is peace freedom is slavery
ignorance is strength Ministry of Truth
what book is this from cheer guys cheers
guys I love your content 1984 that's
from who's gonna stay here to share it's
great oh you're probably right
right yeah 1980 for you bro thanks
knowledge that's a good book everyone
should read it car dock to 21 $10
donation dual Xeon 56 87 small business
server converted to gaming content
creation PC rocky an AMD 7950 upgrade
the graphics and a dram or sell the
system and build a six core Rison system
gosh
I mean Xeon dual 56 87 year you have a
lot of compute power there sorry I did I
miss the green man Jim you got a lot of
compute power there but if your concern
is gaming frequency is definitely gonna
be very significantly important to you
true um so yeah I would I would consider
a something like this X square rising
system because I think could get a nice
boost in IPC yeah I'm right off the bat
and you'll be able to overclock and get
a high frequency so you there you go
that's my suggestion
Matt grams for $5 where can I buy a job
our delineate to the only website I can
find that has it is case king de doesn't
ship to the USA thanks for being awesome
I don't know yeah that might be your
only option for now yeah this mall is
just a dude sound stuff so you know
Adams
yard pretty much so this is a to to or
not D letting doesn't you have a dual
eating tool yeah Bauer
yeah did he send you owner personally I
do you physically hand it to you at
context nice are you gonna put to you so
this is this is for LGA 1150 1151 but
put that cheated use bra yeah it's way
better than then other deal inning
methods because it's much more precise
so which means less risky and less less
prone to damage yeah but I know I know
he's I know he's been working on the one
for the for the the current generation
the LGA 2066 stuff but like they're
still working on it yeah working
progress is also a big challenge because
right now he's got to the 7900 X but
once it goes up beyond that it's gonna
be the larger dies on the 79 twenty
seventy nine forty seventy nine sixty
and seventy nine eighty so if he makes
one right now that works for one and
then those other CPUs start coming out
and people try to use it on those other
CPUs it might actually damage those CPUs
because of the size of the die as well
as other surface mounted hardware that's
on there so it's a difficult thing to do
when you're trying to bring a product to
market like that indeed so yeah business
stuff thank you very much so Matt Grimes
BB q ribs barbecue ribs I'm starting a
small business resin casting making
mechanical keyboard caps and collectible
resin toys any tips for starting a small
business

marketing yeah tactic for get get in get
get in contact with mass drop that'll
get on the map yeah he bored caps are
you kidding that's residents he's a good
choice several injection shot whatever
get beta lots of that sit-up mass drop
they're always looking for like
underground to you know be like
stand out from the rest of the
mainstream hit up mass drop and see like
hey can I just do like a like a you know
a small sale or whatever on your website
maybe that could put you on the grid or
put you on the map somewhere yeah maybe
maybe keyboard manufacturers as well try
to get a partnership going or something
like that yeah anything that has a
larger audience e than you do that can
give you more exposure just use people
yeah just use that pour yourself out via
whore don't be afraid to be a whore
don't tell your parents I said that yep
thank you very much barbecue ribs sticks
$10 donated last week and got two guys
once true two guys one screwed
screwdriver comment thanks guys for the
laughs keep up the great work attempting
to do some pc building time lapses of my
own love of content
two guys one screwdriver do you remember
that how did that come up
I don't even want to know why that was
mentioned slowly vaguely this is why
this is why we should be required to
rewatch the live show the next day I
didn't ever rewind I know I would just
know the occasional time I'm like I like
have to actually pull it up and like oh
god that's terrible
why you know one day well I said I would
watch it as much as I hate them so much
we should one day like maybe for like
our 1000th episode or something or 500
do like a like Kyle and Paul react
reaction to the compilation of just best
moments we'll have like cell or maybe a
couple other moderators yeah that'd be
kind of fun but we'd have to watch it
while we're drinking just to not super
cringe super hard then I'd have to
follow after that where we react to the
one be like window within a window in
Java as far as we can go react exception
it go pretty far thank you very much
sticks for that beautiful idea Jake 3d
five dollars do you both use an editor
or just Paul how much do they edit
versus year and it after how long have
you used an editor so fun fact I was
working with this guy named Joe and he
helped me do some video editing for
projects in the past and CES last year
and then I introduced him to Paul and
they started working
their shape super-shady stuff under the
table you know no evading taxes on it no
no none of that frisky business and then
I introduced Joe to Paul and then Joe
started editing more videos more
frequently for Paul and for a while
there I was not really doing any
contract work with Joe at all until
recently he's edited probably two videos
for me in the last month or so and he's
got there's another one on its way so
Joe is actually kind of double fisting
both me and Paul in the most
professional way possible semen from my
perspective you know Kyle abandoned Joe
left Joe got Joe was like Kyle I need
work and you know I gotta I gotta eat
everything and cows like you Joe
 you you whereas and I was like Joe
I'm gonna provide you a constant supply
of work and so I have been working with
Joe for a year and a half two years
that's right in that range good guy Paul
yeah no you definitely haven't been
working with Joe more Joe edits one or
two of my videos every week I send him
in the raw footage and usually an
outline or something like that if kind
of what I'm going for
yeah yeah that's it altogether he sends
me back a project file and then I load
up the project file run back through the
project and it depends sometimes I'm so
like I watch it and I'm good render it
out sometimes I spend another couple
hours editing it myself it really
depends on the project and whether or
not Joe did a good job Joe is amazing
sometimes he sucks no Joe's awesome by
the way love Joe you're ever interested
in just like you know editing or even
like visual effects he does really good
a really good work on that front those
of you who have seen the fractal design
pre-roll with my grandpa as my grandpa
or like rent runs the car into like that
one into the neighborhood and the car
explodes that's all Joe like Joe does
all the visual effects for pretty much
anything you'd see on my children the
one where Kyle and Josh appear in my
living room with you know the VR
headsets like Joe did that special
effects as well yeah he does a really
good job good job Joe Gigi and nobody
else give him work because he he's he's
ours recording him

thank you so much Zack for grabbing also
English pub less I'm gonna saw out of

alright and that wraps it up for this
we we had two more do we have two more
donation very less very last second so
we're cutting them off after these two
donations again matter we're not reading
any more but SEC SEC posi 12 s $5 I have
a penny mg 45 60 which we were just
talking about the GTX 1063 gigabyte with
a 430 watt power supply so tomorrow I'm
getting an i-5 7600 K should I get a
higher power supply or is the the
430 watt supply it's fine
you're I'm glad you're okay if it's a
decent power supply if it's not like
some cut-rate no-name brand you've never
heard of if it's 80 plus bronze Corsair
you're probably just fine yeah I
wouldn't want to go too much beyond that
GTX 1060 with that because if you
increase your GPU power draw you might
especially if you're over call me yeah
only and only when it's peaking you
might you might start to see a little
bit but with that G with that CPU and
GPU should be totally fine before it in
30 watts indeed and then finally we have
merge dragon for $5 greetings from Las
Vegas would you guys have a fan meetup
here in Sin City well you know we go
there at least once a years yeah I feel
like that wouldn't be out of the
question just usually where they're
doing CES and it's so packed with
everything happening all week so yeah
that makes it more of a challenge maybe
do like an old town meet up yeah you
know we're just like I wouldn't be just
chillin an old town or something like
that but I strip I feel like we're
getting more and more to the point where
when we go places if we're at a place

should just do the fan meetup wherever
ready yeah so we'll well we'll do our
very best to incorporate more of those
