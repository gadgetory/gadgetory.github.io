240 millimeter liquid CPU cooler
fermenter max with addressable RGB LEDs
allowing for unique lighting effects
from the two fans and the water block
the block also has a clear panel with a
flow indicator and there's an in-line
high efficiency ceramic bearing pump if
you're looking for a CPU cooling upgrade
click the local fusion sponsor link in
the video description hey guys how's it
going and welcome back to Pauls hardware
today's video is gonna be pretty short
and in fact I didn't think I was even
gonna be able to make it because if you
recall I did recently a has RGB gone too
far video where I talked about RGB
silliness like putting it on memory and
anywhere you can in a case and even on
SSDs now with this team T force delta
SSD that I have down here at the bottom
addressable - which is nice because you
can actually assign different colors to
each LED in a strip and now Leeanne Lee
has this and I don't even know if I can
explain this to you guys let me just
open this package and see what's inside
now this product has a name it is called
strimmer I'm actually not sure maybe you
guys can help me pronounce that STR imer
is it streamer streamer or strimmer it
could be any of those RGB 24 pin cable
look they haven't put my name on it
which is thoughtful of them they even
have another box inside the first box
with the same stuff on the outside box
so that's pretty cool alright if you
guys didn't read the title of this video
or look at the thumbnail or anything
like that then maybe this is already
evident to you what I'm unboxing right
now but this is an RGB extension cable
24 pin extension cable or your computer
and pretty much every modern gaming PC
is gonna use a 24 pin cable like this
since it's an extension you could use it
with an existing power supply this is
also addressable which means it's going
to connect via the three pin addressable
5 volt RGB header which we're seeing
more on more on newer motherboards and
comes with an adapter it looks like even
a little bracket here for the rear of
your case now since there's not going to
be much to this video besides taking
this out of the box plugging it in and
showing it to you at least give you a
tour of the accessories so PCI Express
bracket adapter right here with three
buttons on it and then this little cable
which wires over to connect up to the
strimmer and this will give you some
external controls so you can push the
buttons on there to change the look and
pretty cool I'm not going to be using
this today just because I have a really
really quick mission of installing it
and seeing how it looks it does come
with an adapter cable though and this
will allow you to plug it into the three
pin headers that we've been seeing on
gigabyte boards in order to match up
with the three pin which also looks kind
of like a four pin header that we're
seeing more commonly on the 5 volts
addressable RGB LEDs that are now all
the rage here is the extension itself
and here I also want to point out that
this is an early sample this is not a
finished product so they did point out
to me that it might not have all the
bells and whistles but it's looking
pretty clean they have a sort of a white
or maybe an off-white sleeving on the
actual power cables themselves and then
you've got this extra set of cabling
bits that goes over the top and I'm
presuming that's what's going to light
up when we plug this in cable extensions
pretty straightforward just got the 24
pin extender end goes in there
this little piece kind of like snaps
around this plastic extension to kind of
hold it in place a little bit and it
does have some cable combs underneath
although these top two or held in place
and I think they're they do that so that
this set of lights will be spread out
properly and won't be able to bend too
much but I'm just going to pass it
through there and try to give it a nice
gentle arc also took the extension the
adapter they provided us and have
plugged that directly into the
motherboard since this motherboard does
have 5 volt addressable RGB header so
now it's connected
the only thing I have an issue with with
the installation here is one trying to
keep all these little guys straight the
the LED part will pop off a little bit
so of the little straps like I showed
you around the back and once it's
plugged in getting the snap done is a
little little difficult it's a bit of
pressure I'm not sure how delicate this
is so kind of be careful oh wait I got
it yay
ready for the turn on all right here's
the first power on oh look at that that
is pretty it's a rainbow it's a my
computer is powered by a rainbow I
should like it I kinda do cuz this video
is about has RGB gone too far and I'm
really not sure I'm not sure like this
opens up a whole realm of possibilities
like we've got you know power supply
cables come into the graphics card and
we get an you know some supplemental
power up there we could put RGB LEDs on
all the cables so I thought things look
pretty good with the default setting
with a plug directly into the
motherboard but just to show what you
can get out of this I plugged in the PCI
bracket and now we're cycling through
some of the different color options that
you get that are built-in so Joe and I
were talking about this product and it
kind of reminds us of like those neon
glow sticks that you used to get you
know they live a glow for you and then
they had slowly wear out and they have
to like put them up next to a light
source to get them to glow again but
this one is powered so it's always gonna
glow and look pretty for you let me know
what you guys think of this though again
it is the Liam Lee streamer or streamer
or streamer let me know in the comments
which of those pronunciations you guys
like the best and then any suggestions
for how Lian Li mites modifier change or
improve this product or if you'd like to
see other versions for like GPU power or
supplemental CPU power for example
personally I'd like to see maybe a
slidable cable comb a little bit further
back I think that would help keep things
smooth especially if you got to tuck it
back behind a motherboard tray through
one of the cable management grommets a
matching one on the cables underneath
there also wouldn't be bad but first
impressions are it's definitely a
striking the visually striking product
and I think any of you guys who are
looking to add that bit of extra pop to
your PC or maybe you're just like a big
fan of Rainbow Brite or My Little Pony
or unicorns that vomit RGB whatever the
case may be the streamer is probably the
product for you guys thank you so much
for watching this video I know it's been
short and sweet but hope you enjoyed it
I don't think I can link to this product
yet because it's still in development
but if it is available I'll post a link
down below thanks for watching hit the
thumbs up button and we'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
