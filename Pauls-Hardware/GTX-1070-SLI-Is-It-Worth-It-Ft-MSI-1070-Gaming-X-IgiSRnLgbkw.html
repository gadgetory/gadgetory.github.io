rapid succession the msi gtx 1070 gaming
ex which is my first 1070 ever then I
got the founders Edition GT extensivity
straight from Nvidia and then I got
another msi gtx 1070 gaming ex or at
least access to one temporarily thanks
to my fencing partner Kyle from
awesomesauce Network so of course let's
just dive right into it here are some
sli custom gtx 1070 benchmarks but first
a quick disclaimer these cards are
review samples they were sent to a
straight from msi and they're set to run
out of the box in OSI mode that's one of
three modes selectable from the MSI
gaming app the other two modes are
gaming and silent if you buy one of
these cards at retail you will need to
get that app go into it and click the OC
move button to run at these same speeds
otherwise yours will run at gaming mode
I also figured that since MSI is
definitely down for some overclocking
they ship them to us and OC mode by the
way and also because several viewers
asked for it in my EVGA GTX 1080 for the
wind video which you can see by clicking
the card right up there for this
comparison I would also use my gtx 980ti
but this time with a nice overclock to
better match what you can get via the
aftermarket cards that have just
recently dropped significantly in price
ok with all that said now here are some
gtx 1070 sli benchmarks
3dmark fire strike is a synthetic
benchmark and it is well optimized for
SLI so we see great scaling from single
card to two way also check out that
980ti doing much better with that
overclock which has it running at about
fourteen twenty two megahertz max
Unigine Heaven also scales well in SLI
and here especially at 4k we have over
90% scaling shows you what's possible
for games that are designed for SLI with
optimized drivers moving on to some
actual games Metro last light is still
very much a challenge graphically
speaking but I'm guessing the drivers
have not yet been updated for two-way
SLI with this title on the ten series as
scaling was pretty laughable Crysis 3
definitely scaled better into way we see
nice games at all three resolutions I
still think it's awesome that Crysis 3
at 14:40 takes a gtx 1080 to hit over 60
frames per second on average still a
monster title GTA 5 also sees some
decent sli scaling at 1440 in 4k as for
those 1080 numbers I'm pretty sure we're
hitting a CPU limitation there are still
occasional stutters unfortunately hence
the low minimum frame rates and lastly
we have rise of the Tomb Raider this is
in DirectX 11 mode right now since I
didn't have time to try the different
SLI modes for DirectX 12 with d-10
series the 10 seventies do seem to get a
bit of a boost in SLI but not quite
enough to beat a single 1080 at 1440 at
least so kind of strange but hopefully
updated future drivers will provide more
performance
so what have we learned from these
benchmarks hopefully also by the way you
guys like the new slides I tried to make
them a little bit easier to read
especially for anyone who might be color
blind the first thing I noticed is that
I found the 980ti can definitely still
hang and that it really does take a gtx
1080 to beat one of these especially if
it's decently overclocked I also learned
that the 1070 is a beast as well and
when scaling played out it hits some of
the best numbers that I've seen with a
two-way SLI setup although granted I
have yet to test a two way GTX 1080s on
the downside we've reaffirmed that good
SLI scaling requires both software and
driver support that some games just
don't gain much from adding a second
card it's this reason more than any
other that keeps me from recommending
multi card configurations for most
gamers finally I should mention my sli
bridge since the 10 series GPUs from
Nvidia have new requirements and a new
high bandwidth sli bridge I didn't have
an HB bridge but fortunately you can use
an LED bridge like this one from MSI
that's only for resolutions up to 4k if
you go 5 care beyond you definitely need
an HB bridge but this one if you're
doing 4k should work just fine and then
according to my numbers it did anyway
with the benchmarks done I'm not really
sure what to talk about next
that's ok though we can take a closer
look at the card then we can do some
overclocking and some temperature and
noise test results as well so the msi
gtx 1070 gaming ex has a custom PCB and
cooler and it sticks to the red and
black theme that msi has been using for
quite some time
aesthetically the twin frozer 6 cooler
does have some sharper edges and some
additional texture details on the shroud
as well as LED lighting that's read
along these sort of jagged protrusions
by the fan and RGB lighting on the msi
logo up on the top for airflow there's
295 millimeter double ball-bearing Torx
2.0 fans and for heat dissipation it
uses 8 millimeter copper squared heat
pipes and a nickel plated copper base
plate the PCB redesign increases power
delivery to a 10 phase array as compared
to the 5 phase setup that's available on
the reference board and it adds another
6 pin power connector for higher
available overall power draw being a
1070 it's got n videos GP 104 Pascal GPU
beneath the cooler that is the same one
that's used in the GTX
eighty but it is cut down to 1920 CUDA
cores and 120 texture units resulting in
raw compute performance coming in at 6.5
teraflops vs. 8.9 on the 1080 you also
get eight gigabytes of gddr5 memory
that's not gddr5 X like you get in the
1080 it runs at eight thousand megahertz
effective clock speed though and it is
an open design on the msi cooler so in
testing it did run cooler than the
founders Edition but it will push more
warm air out into your case so bear that
in mind
back to the lighting though you can
adjust the msi logos colors via the MSI
gaming app software that's the same
software used to engage the OC mode
which has a basic set of effects options
but the only ones I really found usable
at least from aesthetic perspective
where the static option and the
breathing option the logo LED will
default to white and the red LEDs
default to red if the gaming app isn't
running and being that the red lighting
on the rest of the card is always red
finding matching colors for this RGB
logo was definitely a challenge
I found that red and red or red and
whites were all that really looked okay
to me you can turn off the LEDs
independently which does give you a
little bit more flexibility but adding
the second card just led to chaos
there's no sync option so even though
you can access all four of the lighting
zones that's two per card individually
as well as the sli bridge LED which I
actually thought was a pretty cool
option that it can access that on its
own getting them all coordinated in a
visually pleasing way was really next to
impossible
you can either control all of them at
once which removes your ability to
manipulate the RGB LEDs properly or
individually which breaks any effect
syncing hopefully MSI will update and
improve the lighting control software in
the future I guess is what I'm trying to
say what about overclocking though in
SLI I did that and although I had a
limited amount of time with the two-way
setup I still managed to add 115 points
to the GPU both GPUs and about 80 to the
memory that let me hit an initial
overclock of 2100 one megahertz on both
cards but then that then throttled back
to about 20 88 after the cards warmed up
I was still monitoring throttling with a
Unigine Heaven burnin test and as you
can see the cards do pull back from
their initial peak frequencies but only
about fifty to seventy-five megahertz so
not too bad here is a benchmark test
with the over claw
going I had time to run fire strike with
this but for the work I invested in it I
think I got a nice boost broke the
15,000 mark on fire strike extreme a GPU
temperatures stayed well under control
with the MSI cards 68 c-max under load
with a single card and 77 degrees
Celsius for the upper card in a two way
configuration if you're wondering about
that gtx 980ti temperature yes it is a
reference card I was using but the fans
were set to 70% which kept it relatively
cool under load fan noise for the gaming
x10 70s was quite minimal as well they
don't spin up at all at idle which is
pretty common these days and under load
with the OC profile they only got up to
about 40% speed here's a zero fan mode
speed test so you can hear ambient noise
here the fans running at 40% here the
fans running at 60% and finally the fans
at 100%
next is a look at power draw which I am
still impressed with Maxwell was already
very power efficient but comparing the
980ti here you can see how far Pascal
has really come finally there is the
price and these gaming x10 70s from MSI
will cost you four hundred and sixty
dollars each on Newegg at least at the
time of this filming although granted
none are in stock right now I am told
that stock availability will be
improving within the next few weeks so
in July we should see more of these on
store shelves but what do you guys think
of the actual price it's a different
situation this time around with the
founders edition boards costing more
than the non founders edition boards or
reference versus non but it still seems
hard to actually find any 1070 GPUs that
actually cost $380 as promised by Nvidia
at launch let alone this one that costs
more than the founders Edition founders
Edition cost $450 this is for 60 let me
know if you guys think this card is
actually worth it in the comment section
down below because I am curious
personally I think MSI has built a very
nice card around the 1070 functionally
speaking it runs cooler and quieter than
the reference card while offering faster
stock speeds out of the gates that said
I don't think their RGB lighting
implementation really makes sense as the
red accents on the card limit what you
can do with it
also the pricing seems pretty high at
the time of writing at least compared to
Nvidia's MSRP and I definitely got a
knock em aside one more time for
shipping these reviewer cards at OC mode
which just didn't really feel like it
was on the up-and-up as for SLI
performance it was impressive but I
would still opt for a single GTX 1080
over two of these especially for nine
hundred and twenty dollars for two of
these the 1080 would be cheaper and the
games that would have great two-way GPU
performance will be balanced out by the
poorly optimized titles that show little
no or even reduced performance when it
comes to SLI and so endeth this video
guys links to this card on Amazon as
well as my Paul's hardware store we can
