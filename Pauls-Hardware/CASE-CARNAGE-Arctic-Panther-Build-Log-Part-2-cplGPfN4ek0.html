arctic panther huh
part 2 alright basically here's where we
are where we left off last time and
first off I have to mention my back
plates for my graphics cards I got a ton
of feedback on that ton of people said
they really liked the idea of going with
it which which I was kind of stoked on
too but I also had feedback from several
people including an emergency message
from Steve from gamers Nexus some
messages that he was relaying from
people who were getting in touch with
him to try get in touch with me that
this is not the best idea if I can't do
all the proper mounting points with the
screws for the blocks underneath and
that this will end up leading to
potentially overheating VRMs in
particular because there's not enough
pressure going on there so I thought I
considered very soon I'm going to be
switching over to these ek back pleats
so I'll get started on that but beyond
that the next steps for today down here
we have some examples of hardware I'm
going to be installing starting off with
fittings these are the ek HDC fitting 16
millimeter as far as the PT G outer
diameter that they work with G 1/4 of
course just like pretty much all the
major fittings you use on the market and
those are going to be everywhere that I
need fittings on the builds such as the
inlet and outlets of my monoblock right
here now the inlet has to be right here
the center because the inlet has to be
pushing the the fluid directly down over
the CPU because that's where the CPU is
everything else is cooling like the V
RMS up here and that kind of thing and
this is going to be the outlet that
means I can't quite do the same layout
or configuration that I have with the
original ap build so that's gotten me
thinking about how to do things a little
bit differently the other things that I
wanted to do differently this time was
make sure that I had a built in Inlet as
well as a drain port so to add those I'm
gonna use these the UK AF fill port
given quarter black and these are
basically two piece things I actually
had to pry this one off with some pliers
because it
on there pretty thick but basically make
a hole in the case pop that through its
and then secure it from the other side
with the string that goes around the
outside and then you have a built in
porch that you can use to easily fill or
drain I'll be pairing that up with the
ball valve the guy right here and that's
basically just a ball belt can let it
flow or turn it off and that will allow
me to turn the fill ports on or off now
for the drain I think the best part is
gonna be a story if you can't see very
well but right here at the bottom it's a
solid piece of the case that I can drill
through it doesn't conflict with that it
doesn't conflict with the dust filter
underneath and it's clear underneath
there as well so I'll be making a hole
right there
to put that on - and would that be fun
and from there all either use just a
fitting to go on there and then tubing
off of that or I might potentially just
do this this guy right on there you
might do that on the side over there
we'll see another thing I discovered
just as I've been looking at stuff is I
want to put an exhaust fan here at the
back it wasn't able to do that with the
original version because it wasn't
enough clearance for the outlets here
and I need to put something on for the
tubing and the flow fluid to go through
that radiator and it would conflict with
the 120 millimeter fan here I tried a
few things with like putting adapters
directly on the outlet ports and stuff
and even potentially shifting the fan
down as low as possible because you can
fit it below where the actual mounting
points are but even with that it wasn't
enough so what I actually did was the
top radiator right now I have shifted
over so basically the two mounting
points like here at the middle that each
Center one has instead of being there
and there I shifted them over here so
it's missing several screw holes down at
the further end and at this end so I
will have to screw through there but
unfortunately that fits in there and
there's clearance for everything there's
also space at the back through the top
right here or I can add a fill port and
so that's where I'm also going to be
doing a little bit more case modding so
what I need to do in the near future
rather than swapping out those back
plates is get this guy here set up so I
can kind of get a gauge on where my pump
reservoir
everything is gonna be so this is the
bracket that's gonna go on the radiator
also I have decided not to go with the
slim radiator I want as much cooling
performance as possible so I'm not going
to use a slim addition I'm going to use
the original performance edition 240 rad
for the front that I had with the
original bills so that's gonna go in the
front there this bracket on it and that
brackets gonna hold the pump so see
that's gonna work
I think I figured out how I want the
loop to go you guys might have noticed I
got this assembly with the 240
millimeter front radiator it's it's just
kind of hanging in there right now I did
mount it from the other side but it's
got the bracket on the bottom of the Dec
pump and then put the taller reservoir
on it with a special head with the
multiple outputs as well as outputs at
the back
so because the reservoir is kind of tall
and wouldn't conflict with the inlet
outlet of the rasie radiator up here has
some double 45-degree angled joints that
I put on either one of those just so
they can get around that and there's
there's enough clearance it gets by
there and it's not actually touching so
these are dual rotary fittings so it
means they have a decent amount of play
in them which will be helpful as that'll
be probably some of the tighter bends I
need to do to get that worked out so
starting from where the pump pushes
water out right here I think I'm gonna
go up and then into this front 240
millimeter radiator out the other side
of that and then I actually have this
little thing that I put together and
this is actually this is just a bracket
like you'd used to actually hold up a
reservoir like that one but I instead
have used it to attach this primo chill
flow indicator so I think I'm gonna pop
that on the side yeah like like so or
there abouts and it's I can move that up
or down if I need to because I want to
use a flow indicator but it's actually
also in a good spot because when I need
to come out of this front radiator I'm
gonna go over and then into the top of
this and then out the side and into the
CPU or into the monoblock for the CPU
right there out of the monoblock and
then up into the top 360 rad out of the
top 360 red and down over to my GPU
configuration right here as an inlet I'm
going to put these both in parallel so
the outlet will be down here that will
come down like hereabouts and go into
this little T splitter so this is
actually a 3-way T splitter it's good to
two on the sides and then also goes at
the bottom so bottom will come down I'll
need to do some some in-betweens here's
some male-male adapters but then got my
shutoff right there
drain port down at the bottom and then
this would go just straight back into
the the pump right here but
I actually have to cross over because
the inlets over here so I'm probably
actually going to go back here and then
into the pump Inlet that's on the back
and then for my fill I'm just gonna use
one of the parts from the cap here it's
got inlets on the back of the cap and
then that's just gonna go up to my fill
port which I'm gonna put right up there
so we have a plan and now I have work to
do
so yesterday actually went really well
just because I was able to kind of
buckle down and put my head down and get
a bunch of work done so I was very
satisfied with with the work I got done
during the day however looking at it
this morning I realized like it kind of
looks as far as the system exactly the
same as it did when I started yesterday
morning but that is not to say that I
didn't get a lot done a lot of it had to
do with planning so figuring it out I
figure out exactly how Luke was gonna go
where the you know from point A to point
B to Point C and all that what direction
it was gonna flow and that was all
really important and figuring out
exactly where the reading ears we're
gonna be how many fans that's gonna be
able to fit in there
shifting some stuff around and then of
course very importantly the fill port at
the top and the drain port at the bottom
and some extra little case mods just to
make sure I came out the radiators
properly and everything so it's all that
took some time but turned out really
well especially the fill in the drain
ports I'm really really happy with that
now my attention has turned back to the
power supply which you guys might have
seen in the first video I did a little
bit of modification on I'm just sanding
the side of it and painting it all black
just to kind of black it out and make it
look a little bit cleaner it doesn't
turn out exactly how I wanted and I need
some better sandpaper I need some really
fine grit sandpaper so I can sand that
down a little bit better and get rid of
some of the streaks that are on there I
have some really nice edging primer
paints that was recommended by Bill Owen
it's made for like automotive work and
stuff so now that'll do a good job
covering it up I just need to make a
quick run to the store to get some some
better sandpaper also I've realized that
whereas the original Arctic Panther had
the right 24 pin and 4 8 pin connectors
that I had sleeved for the power cables
coming from the power supply for the
video cards and the motherboard the
supplemental CPU power is only a 8 pin
on the original an X 99 version and now
I need 8 plus 4 so I'm gonna need to
figure out how to get an extra 4 pin
supplemental CPU power cable which
shouldn't be too tough but hopefully I
won't have to mod things up too much
anyway I'm gonna get over to the store
even start off the 320 and hit it with
the 600 - yeah
alright guys here it is I am gonna do a
once-over of the system in its current
state because I think I've gotten to the
point where I do is getting too long
there's too much going on and I've
discovered other things that still need
to be done so it's a good time to
probably cut it off now the good news is
all of the elements of the water cooling
loop are pretty much installed where I
where I want them to be and I've even
gone ahead and at least for the sake of
not lying to you guys in the last video
done my first bit of tubing installation
although I think I'm going to slip it up
swap it out because it's a little too
long and I might have scuffed it while I
was installing it but that's it
the loop as already mentioned starts
from the pump down there goes up through
that first tube that's already put in
into this radiator it's going to come
out the back of that radiator and it's
going to do a little little several
turns over there to go on the top of
this primo chill flow indicator which is
going to be holding onto the vertical
reservoir right there I have the Primo
chill flow indicator into the monoblock
out of the monoblock into the top 360
red out of the top 360 red into the two
GPUs in parallel and then out of that
into this little assembly which I kind
of put together last night I popped a
90-degree angle on the on the top of
that and I think it actually makes it
line up a little bit better with this
guy and just looks a little bit cleaner
like that so that will come out of there
and go into here drains at the bottom
and then out of here and into the back
of the pump so I got to work that out
too so several bends that will be a
little bit challenging but overall
nothing too terrible oh and then of
course the drain or I'm sorry the fill
port on the top of there is going to go
into the top of the reservoir so so
that's planned out I was able to fit all
seven fans in so three on the top got my
exhaust in the back I got the two
intakes that are there in the front and
so that's cool I also probably going to
do one in the bottom still as well
though I got to figure out where exactly
I can fit that where it will be the most
functional and that kind of thing I can
go without that tube with them a little
worried that I have too much negative
pressure so that's all well and good but
you're probably noticing that the main
piece that's missing right now is my
power supply and that is presenting a
few more just last minute challenges for
me now you probably saw me do
of repainting I which turned out ok I
think I I'm just going to go with it as
is there's a little bit of texture there
as far as where I sanded it but it's
doing okay but I am an in need of an
additional four pin supplemental CPU
power connectors so I had salvaged or
basically stolen this CPU lead from an
EVGA sleeve to power supply cable kit
which I figured well it's sleeved enough
it'll it'll it's not gonna be very
visible so it'll be okay I was gonna
rewire that and I'd have to probably pop
the cap off here and swap one of those
on and whatever yeah I love this stuff
in my garage because I save things
including the fractal Newton $1,000
modular cable kits but then I went in
here and I was like oh good there's an
EPS 12-volt supplemental CPU power
connector there yeah it's got its gate
eight pin plugs on both sides so
actually the white plug will probably be
fine that's the power supply this plug
will not fit under the motherboard cuz
it's a four pin and there's capacitors
on either side so that I would need to
pop this off either way so so I got to
figure that out
I might actually sleeve one of these
either the sleeve this one it's still up
in the air but I've also figured that um
the cable from the pump comes back here
check surely goes off in the two 1/4 PWM
control plugs into the motherboard 1/4
power directly to the power supply and
that's all yellow and blue and green and
there's no way to hide it right there so
I'm pretty sure I'm going to pull that
off sleeve it to so combine that cabling
stuffs that I need to work out the
details for with the fact that I still
have all the tubing installation and two
bending to do and I think we're in for
part three for the arctic panther videos
I kind of decided when I embarked on
this project that I was just gonna put
about a day to a day and a half of work
into each video kind of cut it off where
I'm at and then give you guys a video
for it so hope you're bearing with me
through the multi-part stuff and I'm
trying to do at least one of these a
week until it's done thank you guys so
much for watching though hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed this one and
part three coming hopefully very very
soon if you guys have any feedback
comments questions whatever leave them
in the comment section down below and
I'll try to take a look at those and
give you guys some responses too and
we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
