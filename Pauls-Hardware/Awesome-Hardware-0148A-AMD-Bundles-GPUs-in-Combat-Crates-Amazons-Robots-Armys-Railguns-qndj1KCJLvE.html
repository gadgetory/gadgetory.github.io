things are okay yeah
don't need no manual theoretically
possibly maybe tissue you know what I
also did I ever did we ever update the
like the the bitrate or anything update
it I'm sure it's fine okay hey everyone
take a look and it looks like we're live
so hi guys and welcome this is awesome
hardware a live show it's very special
and we do it every week Tuesday evenings
5:30 p.m. Pacific streams to twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware as well as our
YouTube channel right now we're
streaming to my channel Paul's hardware
this is episode 148 so go for about an
hour ish or so on my channel and then
we'll switch to Kyle's channel when we
do that link is in the description thank
you very much to all of you guys who are
joining us live turn up your volume if
you can't hear us
we attempted to do a quick fix but this
is about as good as it's gonna get I
think are we out of focus or is that we
might do us just slightly out of focus
or is it gonna do the punch n thing they
cheese cheese it's not punching in over
here though I'm not punching in all
right cool okay a little
looks good okay okay where was I uh yes
so was dream live and we talk about
technology and we also drink beer
cerveza so feel free to join us if
you're of age and drink responsibly and
all that good stuff the cheers and thank
you for being here and we are quickly
going to plug our stores if you like our
content that we produce or you just want
something to wear and you want to be
high quality then check out this new
print look at this ox blood it's not ox
blood shirt ox blood yes this shirt is
soaked in genuine ox blood well it
better be so I'm told though I might not
be the case I feel like that might be
animal animal cruelty or something like
that but it is a different color it's
sort of a dark maroon and John says it's
like its favorite color now so rusty
vibe yeah yeah it's kind of rusty I like
it get your rusty thumbscrew beyond that
I am sold out of mouse pads and desk
mats but I do have more of those coming
in in another couple weeks so don't
worry those will be restocked I also got
bottle openers all that good stuff
Kyle's store did I say my store pulsar
Burnett if you want to shop at my store
counselors bit with tech slash store
yep it's not the rip game pad shirt yeah
on sale and then we've got a couple
bottle openers with the you know the
classic classic designs that you guys
are familiar with hats hoodies mugs
glasses all good stuff all the things so
thanks to you guys for supporting us and
if you buy during the show we will give
you a shout out at the end of the half
yes we will violate you with our
Johnson's I think that's about that's
about all I that's right yeah that was
good smooth solid oh yeah my sister
thinks we're on top of things I managed
my show might not be super long today
but it is gonna be super high quality so
let's get right into the news accounts
tech news generic news we throw it all
into this category and first off an
article from videocards dot-com
and this one's actually pretty legit
because it's actually stuff that's
available for sale right now but MD has
made certain they've taken actions for
better for worse some some actions more
more effective than others to try to get
graphics cards into the hands of gamers
they had this sort of weird program that
they did last year when they launched
the original rides and stuff to let you
get a bundle with like didn't you have
to get a they can get a monitor but
there's only one specific monitor and it
was like a thousand dollar monitor yeah
it just it wasn't it wasn't people
didn't didn't really jump on it this new
thing though is combat creats and these
are actually available for sale I linked
one of them in the description of the
video so feel free to click on that or
you can go over to the video cards
article but combat crates basically you
get a motherboard processor and a
graphics card all in one box
I'm not assuming they have different
configurations of hardware yeah it's not
like that crazy or anything like that
but here is the here's here's this
combat crape bundle with the horizon 5
1600 you get a you get a Radeon rx 580
and this is the 8 gig it's not it's the
8 gig 580 that's good and then you get
an MSI 350 350 tomahawk and for
motherboard all for 550 dollars this was
actually 600 bucks when when video cards
did the articles so the price has even
come down a little bit more it's pretty
good you know if you calculate the cost
of the two other products that are
readily available being the rise in 5
1600 it's about 170 H dollars hundred
and eighty h dollars depending on where
you buy it right now right motherboard
will cost you about 85 bucks so that
means that you're only paying an extra
say 30 30 40 dollars well you're
basically paying somewhere in the 250 to
$300 range for an 8 gig rx 580 it's
really good
just kind of like read almost like
retail price yeah vaguely they said that
we're calling retail very good you don't
count that you also have to buy a CPU
and motherboard which are now last gen
since risin two has come out so there is
speculation in the article and
possibly valid speculation that's the
fact that they are pairing these with
last-gen thousand series stuff which are
still perfectly viable I mean there's
nothing wrong with the 1600 but you know
if I was buying right now I'd probably
go to the 2600 versus 1600 yeah they're
trying to get rid of all their old
supply yeah that'd make room for the new
stuff be 350 tomahawk motherboard at
least from MSI I checked a couple places
didn't have the most fabulous reviews so
it's not exactly the highest on board
UEFI issues or just you know reviews I
didn't I didn't read through all of them
yeah they were just new a the new way
customers didn't think too much of it
racist against you know Native Americans
this clearly thing what they were the
Native Americans that associated nope
now I'm curious tomahawk oh the tomahawk
it's a really bad joke you're right I
didn't you shouldn't feel bad for not
getting my terrible joke cuz I heard
tomahawk I thought of like the missile
okay
multiple ways that could have gone okay
there I'll keep that in mind next time
there are what the missile approach you
could you could do that I mean take that
angle I'm sure there'll be other
opportunities less controversial this
will come up again equally controversial
there are also bundles with the rise in
seven 1700s so if you want to eight core
you can do that too
who knows if more of these are gonna
come out sir if it's just gonna be a
short-lived thing until they run out of
stock of the 1000 series CPUs and 300
series motherboards but since we're
always trying to give you guys some
ideas of where you can buy reasonably
priced computer hardware and more
specifically graphics cards being a
difficult thing to find right now maybe
that will help some of you guys out
actually reasonably priced bundles yeah
good to see okay next up story from an
antic this is about Lenovo and their new
series of laptops like yes bow quietly
quietly listed according to this article
and these are the old-school Lenovo
think
pants the the the design that has not
changed for quite some time but for lots
of people that's fine because this is
their business design and people like to
get business work done with it now as
long as you've forgiven Lenovo for
superfish and all that stuff back in the
day never I never have you know I'm
still on the fence about it never buy it
then perhaps one of these laptops might
be interesting for you now the
interesting thing about these is they're
based on AMD processors actually aimed
EAP use and in fact some mobile ap use
don't seem to be available on the
desktop horizon 727 or 2d with Vega 10
Verizon 5 2500 you with Vega 8 or arisin
320 200 you with Vega 3 so a few
different varieties there these are also
going to feature a discreet trusted
platform module 2.0 chip I don't know
what like I'm vaguely know what the
original trusted platform module thing
was it's a business thing it's business
security that's what it's there for
yeah there's apparently a new discrete
version of it I don't know what that
means if you if you work in IT you
probably do and it's more buts it's it's
important for IT and security security
is this used good up to 32 gigs of DDR
for memory via to som slots
2400 mega transfers per second
speculated by the article but that seems
reasonable storage 512 gig PCIe nvme
MDOT - SSD or of course since these are
laptops and there's lots of different
variants of them 502 gig hard drive 1
terabyte hard drive or combo SSD and
hard drive the e 485 has a 14 inch
screen the e 585 has a 15.6 inch screen
and there's actually a couple difference
oh look you can flip it and flip it
backwards like that I like how much
thinner the workstation you know
targeted lenovo laptops are oh yeah and
they're very there they're pretty thin
they're not like ridiculously thin like
you think they're gonna fall no but
they're catching up to like the sleek
form factor or like the gaming laptops
and stuff but you got it you get a sex
listing of specs here so as you can see
14 and 15 inch I was thinking that the
lower resolution was just gonna be the
14 inch but actually apparently either
size screen is available with either
this is a low resolution to meet 1366 by
768 sat arable original it kinda makes
sense that a 14-inch like you can get
away with it if it's reasonably priced
but I feel like 1920 by 1080 is really
the way to go baseline standard right
now it is an IPS screen though and then
a few more specs listed here about like
the GPU that's integrated and and all
that kind of thing down here at the
bottom no price
okay no price listed here so I was kind
of sad about that I was expecting
probably these well you're reasonably
priced an ant X says that the affordable
and the low-end ones there will be
affordable laptops prior by the Rison
320 200 APU and featuring hard drives
along with HD displays that will
probably retail for 600 or less Wow it's
not bad so that's pretty that's pretty
cheap that's really good so yeah to keep
an eye on these I I mean I was I've
always been a big fan Lenovo I like
recommended them to people until the
superfish crap yeah but I don't I don't
know him two laptops all that often
anyway so okay moving on
oh and they have USB 3.1 tape see that's
good
Amazon is apparently working on a robot
home robot a home robot has a robot to
go like in your home like a sex sex
robot picture get bigger there we go
like a super hot sexy robot no no
unfortunately there is no picture of
this rumored robot so don't be don't be
confused by this picture that they've
used for the TechCrunch article this is
an example say it's pretty convincing
robot this is just like a ball dude this
is well that's Jeff that's that's
gesture-based mr. Vsauce right things us
and besos besos bit bit Bayes us no it's
too many potential pregnancy is a man of
mystery yes article sourced from
Bloomberg but the codename of the robot
building program at Amazon Nesta Oh
desta I was gonna say sounds a lot less
intimidating than Skynet they they are
working on it though and and although
there's pictures of a completely
different robot that's made by Boston
Dynamics
there are no other pictures that's what
you want to see me shot when you hear an
article about Amazon making a robot you
want to see a picture of said robot but
we're gonna have to sate you guys with
pictures of spot mini which is what Jeff
was was walking along with their latest
spot mini for you guys but Amazon wants
to start trying this robot which is not
being pictured here on screen again this
is a different robot that you're seeing
but I'm just showing that to you to give
you a visual aid I want to start trying
it with Amazon employees this year
planning to launch it to consumers as
early as 2019 let's give you a more what
an exciting time to be an Amazon
employee that's gif hey you should get
this killer robot and you get to test it
out it's a scarier stuff you live by the
end of the trial then we'll we'll push
it to retail this is this is the spot
many pretending to be a velociraptor
yeah this freaked me the shit out when I
saw it earlier showed it to me this is
this is not something to to be excited
about the vesta project at amazon has
been rumored for a while and according
to the article has been in the works for
several numbers for a number of years oh
god is just now starting to take off and
job listings from amazon have recently
gone up for robotics experts with titles
like software engineer robotics just
when you thought it was safe so there's
the robots working together - good lord
reminds me of the raptor scene in
Jurassic Park obviously they have a high
of mine they can work together I think
we've shown that clip here on the show
before but yeah Jeff apparently likes
robots he's been spotted with the spot
many amazon has acquired a few robotics
companies as well the vesta project
itself is being overseen by lab 126 the
lab at amazon amazon R&amp;amp;D center at
center i should say that created the
echo and the fire devices so those were
successful who knows maybe the robot
will be too but they've been trying to
make robots for quite some time does
that mean the robot will also come with
a remote just like that
just like the fire it probably means
that the robot will always be listening
to you and will pick up random
conversations we be able to learn from
their little chairs amazon suggested
feet or whatever
great alright that's all for my
introductory tech news segment glorious
now that we're all freaked out and what
do we have next
next is sword fight well your fight says
put my PC but we do need beer don't we
we deal the old dry here man a sobering
moment right now not a fan doesn't feel
like doesn't feel like awesome Hardware
doesn't feel like us you always know how
to bring us back you know that and be
careful I might have been jostled around
a bit I've been I've been in I've been
in therapy and we've been we've been
learning about you know come from being
comfortable with bottles and you know
the guy I see is really good no you're
not you're sweating a little bit yeah
just a single bead hands are shaking but
still seem you know yep I just can't
make eye contact with the bottle as they
do it because I almost did make icon
well you don't have a glass ready I do
I'm totally a I'm totally on it look at
this we go
didn't didn't didn't jostle around
there's my web Redemption for the day
all right yes
so for certified today I have poured
myself too much
that's fine I'll pour a little four more
in a year glass it's totally fine even
when you're Heather Heather's driving
you so true that's yeah that's probably
all right for swordfight we Kyle and I
argue about a question usually it's
nobody don't it's very serious question
yes we do we asked you guys that same
question and you guys can vote in a
straw poll and we see whether our
arguments sway your opinions because
obviously we're really good at arguing
about things for today I have an
existential question and this was
actually brought on by an excellent
video that went up which is currently
that's gone up it's number six on
trending now two people maybe or not to
Pete maybe you've already seen it this
videos by cgp CGP grey who
I don't I don't know anything about CGP
grey he makes really good YouTube videos
famous animator on YouTube does
animation he has a very unique narration
style as well but this is the fable of
the dragon tyrant and it's actually that
very unique and different art style to
what he typically does it's very well
done did he hang up the dragon tyrant or
resistant example we'll jump straight to
the credits I'm not gonna show you guys
the whole thing it's just really well
done though here's Hughes who actually
did everything the original story by
Nick Bostrom illustration by Newt
Holland animations by Peter Voss music
by David Rees and adaptation and Mary
shouldn't I say okay so it's so story
get tail now spoiler alert
you guys should watch this it's a 30
minute video it's really well done and
it's just one of those videos you watch
where you like just like wow this it's
it's very well done video that's well
narrated and put together than
everything but the video itself to
paraphrase - since Kyle hasn't hasn't
seen it we're gonna argue about this
right now it's about a town or like a
kingdom and then there's Dragon and the
dragon lives on top of the mountain and
dragons indestructible undefeatable they
can't do anything about this dragon and
the dragon demands a thousand citizens
go and be sacrificed to the dragon to
eat everyday so they try to defeat the
dragon decide they can't and they start
appeasing the dragon by sending the
dragon a thousand people to die every
single day but then time goes by and
they improve technology over time and
they start to reel some people start to
realize we could actually defeat the
dragon but other people have become so
entrenched and so used to living with
the dragon that they actually think like
no we deserve the dragon and there are
different interpretations obviously it's
a story so different for different
people it can be interpreted in
different ways from what I have read
about it it's mostly it's about death
and it's about death in modern times
where we have gone from having a life
expectancy of you know 40 50 years old
to much older than that in developed
countries and we have the technology and
the science to be able to potentially
push off death and not have to die but
some people actually think that we
shouldn't
and do that so we're gonna decide that
we're gonna argue that right now this is
a fairly heavy sword fight super sweet
Jesus should we accept the inevitability
of death were you guys expecting that we
would go we would be just headlong right
into that right there okay I was not
here's the question you guys can argue
can go ahead and click the link and go
over to strawpoll we accept Thank You
self for posting the link in chat cell
processing our excellent moderators oh
we love yo so feel free of course to see
if I can do that too geez I wasn't ready
to answer this was it too much
oh man those making a bitly link thank
you so I'm just gonna have to bust out
my most serious response ever right now
I know blow everyone away
you know the secret weapon that I've
been hiding all this time it's gonna
come out right now
just was wasn't ready to dispatch it so
soon but no I actually don't have a
great answer
um should we accept it you know what I
think we should not you try to live
forever because life is no can I argue
that we can accept death but we're able
to prolong its inevitable arrival
no you have yes or no okay options are
yes okay all right no we should we
should we should we should be able to
live forever if we have the option to if
the technology allows it Society allows
it then it should be done because why
not keep existing if you have the option
to death has never been our choice
historically and so if we have a choice
all of a sudden then why not keep that
as a viable option and sure you can you
can say that you know morally or
ethically it's not sound but that's just
you sticking to your old traditional
roots and being familiar and and
complacent with the existing laws of
nature but if you can look past that and
break through to the next level of what
life has to offer then it opens up a lot
of doors it opens up many possibilities
that would never before be achievable
can you open that door for people cuz I
can open like literal doors for people
and I can continue opening literal doors
for people if I can just stay alive
forever I could be like the infinite
door man and and be like an infinite
door holder me like right this way you
sir
all the doors that you can open with
this new new lease on life are our
infinite by definition quite literally
and you would be a fool not to take that
opportunity you person you mortal
is that a mere mortal bastard I
suggesting that you are any immortal
maybe I am this question is actually I'm
still breathing on conclusion flight it
could very well be immortal okay let me
let me know you know I can understand
Kyle I can understand how from your
fairly limited perspective the prospects
of living forever might have some appeal
for you but if I have learned anything
from the
why light series it is that those among
us who do live the immortal life
eventually become weary and tired of
this world because when you have an
unlimited amount of anything as we all
learn from economics there is what is
known as diminishing marginal utility
diminishing marginal utility means the
more you have of something the less
valuable that thing is and that is why
the brevity of life verily is what makes
life so sweet this beer for example I
could finish drinking and then there
could be an unlimited amount but you
know what I probably get pretty sick of
that figure after a while and eventually
I'd be like what's the point and really
that's what it comes down to if you
never die is that eventually you get to
the point where you like you know what
I'm just sick of all this people are
stupid
there's sand and it gets everywhere and
and I just you know there's no moment
you know all the good craft beers were
bought up by like big-name breweries and
now like that still tastes kind of the
same but it's just not it feels kind of
empty inside you know
all right so there we go very depressing
trust me guys that's the I don't think I
don't think we win either way
no we did were posts we're screwed we're
totally screwed okay all right I should
have just gone for what does
inevitability mean yeah 46 people would
have agreed with you there
Wow you win though Cal you win but no
you win what you should accept it yes oh
yes you would I won I won all right
yeah I could have just like I'm you
going I'm glad that there's so many
nihilists out there or I don't know what
else doesn't matter
maybe maybe just maybe just French
philosophy that's French for the world
let's move on
cool that's warm it's why we tackled
that topic turn this fan on that'll
surely prevent anyone from forging an
elixir for life yeah there's gonna be a
noise now cuz I just turned the fan on
yeah that's getting warm in here sorry
guys I haven't bought a good fan good
quiet fan yet for the office I will soon
we're going with the Lian Li fashion fan
so your pets say a fascist in a fashion
van a fascist fan okay not cool final
segment for my half of the show today is
tech of the day after tomorrow yes
indeed technology the let's Kyle have an
ice cream cone probably eat the ice
cream cone oh of course
can't early okay thank you Ruben's was
delicious
real freakin guns this is exciting cuz
cuz Rogan's railguns
you guys sound like you're saying real
guns no real real real good yes army is
developing ribbons for use in in the
army and stuff and this this this one
also has just
really cool video I can play right here
from the peloton Atomics
electromagnetics and indeed general
atomics electromagnetics is where the
pentagon's defense ordinance technology
consortium has awarded a contract I'm
sorry general atomics more specifically
there the developer of the US Navy's
railgun system this is a slow-motion
shot this is a projectile slow-motion
watch an impact ah
Wow graphics on that awesome I feel
quick contract specifies the conch the
construction of railgun prototypes that
could be used by the army in a ground
combat role the rail guns involve using
powerful electron and sorry powerful
electrical currents to generate a row of
magnetic fields between two rails
that's the name railgun objects placed
between the rails are accelerated
parallel to the rails to tremendous
philosophy velocities they can send
objects flying at speeds of up to Mach 6
whoo what's that damn but like six times
yes I believe making sure there's not a
logarithmic skit maybe I make it faster
than the speed of light amazing anyway
there are two potential uses that the
army might be seeking these out for one
is interesting but slightly more boring
which is more long-range work lobbying
projectiles to extremely long ranges
like um since it can shoot really fast
basically like yeah like a like a
missile like destructive objects or like
mock for impact right on target
I love slow-mo Mach 4 it's super awesome
impact speed equal to operational impact
at 35 kilometers 35 kilometers what I'm
saying what what were you asking so you
could like put a potato in it like a
potato cannon I don't I think like the
region which I think the projectile has
to anything that's in there has to
projectile needs to be able to be
accelerated by
electromagnets so it needs to be metal
or magnetic I think but let's not get
too deep here or of it revealed my
actual lack of knowledge about this Oh
compared to what I've written down in my
notes my notes from the articles I was
playing did you think I had like
assembling encyclopedic knowledge of
this is helping to exploit you all of
you I mean I've only all it I've only
just learned about the rails in the
railgun I can't I kind of knew about
that before but it's in the second the
second potential it so that it's a long
range right you know you got a far back
it can shoot really far but you know
their long range which is useful it's
you know you want more exciting the
prior missile the cool one
number two using it as a hypervelocity
gun on a main battle tank yeah like a
badass tank with the railgun mounted on
top I'm pretty sure that they have those
in certain video game yeah probably like
a command &amp;amp; Conquer type game they must
have real guns so they don't mean using
it like on a tank to attack it they mean
literally I'm using it mounting it real
because I talk about ground uses for
these yes the tank mounted railgun
according to the article would likely
dominate the land fields a land
battlefield of the future smashing
through even the take thickest of enemy
armor and impressive ranges ring ranges
is they still need to reduce the
footprint though they have actually
reduced the size of a functional railgun
by about eight times they made it eight
times smaller but they still need to
shrink it down even further in order to
fit on top of a tank and the current
barrels quote-unquote the actual rails I
guess that they use to accelerate the
projectile right now only currently
lasts for a handful of shots because
they get because I destroy I don't know
if that's just vibration their pressure
were friction there's no probably
wouldn't be friction but I don't know I
don't know if they're magnetism just the
projectile goes out so fast that there's
a blast wave of Awesomeness that
destroys the rails behind it I'm not
sure sounds legit
but yeah the army wants rails that lasts
for 1,000 or more uses 1000 plus that's
definitely more than a handful
yeah and in case you guys are wondering
my inspiration for talking about this
story to Dave the railgun
here's some footage from quake 2 hey I'm
gonna hear play quake 2 groundbreaking
first in a while shooter on PC hi
quake - I played back when I was at USC
and we had a t1 connection in in the
like late 90s which was in Sainz really
good very late nineties the very end of
the 90s don't don't do math and figure
out how old I am
he's like old but yeah quake 2 was
awesome and we played it a lot and this
is cute too this is deathmatch
deathmatch one map but let me figure
there alright so here's the real gun and
I just like water cannon I like how the
real gun looks it's like a spiral II
blue thing it looks like it's got like
an instantaneous shot across the map the
gun itself looks pretty wicked ends I
just I remember I had a few like epic
battles with the real gun where I was
like just just on target with it and and
did really well but quick - real gun
MLG back in the day MLG paul MLG yeah
was never quite that okay moving on
Raylan more Tech is the day after
tomorrow China we've talked about China
doing pretty shady stuff like like their
social their social score program which
is like black mirror black mayors what
everyone keeps comparing it to but
they're actually doing this too which is
maybe a cool thing or maybe not I don't
know it depends depends on how you look
at it and whether you think playing God
is okay and whether you think the
impacting the climate and one area might
affect another area but China is
planning to create artificial rain over
an area three times the size of Spain
and they're using modern technology in
order to do this I don't think there's a
map there's no real map on this but
north of Tibet basically is what they're
looking at this is China's latest
weather manipulation project and it's
being reported by the South China
Morning Post the the actual hardware
they're using is solid fuel burners
drones planes artillery and a network of
weather satellites covering vast
waves of the Indian Ocean is its way
this is weights squads Suarez SWAT vast
swath is here in Mexico it's Suarez more
fan okay where was I
yes their aim is to create a distributed
system capable of combating climate
change and increasing rainfall in the
region by up to ten billion cubic meters
it's a lot of water that's approximately
seven percent of China's annual water
consumption every year they will place
thousands of chambers burning solid
fuels on the Tibetan Plateau that
produced silver iodide when lit silver
iodide acts as a condensate for water
medical molecules in the air so water
magic molecules gather around the iodide
amount of molecules thank you he fucked
up the word molecules three times in a
row all the molecules they same three
times in a row you said molecules
incorrectly molecules
he said molecules not acute oh I just I
was just rolling the L it's a it's a
it's a it's just like it's a it's from
my native tongue obviously I have an
accent Kyle it's very offensive of you
to make fun of that but maybe I'm just
misunderstanding you I can't hear
through your thick actor to get through
this okay
this is important information the
pairing thing to know can be their
molecules without China and their and
their cloud seeding project that's what
it's called it's called cloud cloud
seeding sounds like that's after you
have after you have sex with the cloud
cloud seeding okay sexual term yes
obviously this video is gonna get
flagged now so yeah this creates rain or
snow to fall as water watcher molecules
condensate on the iodide molecules now I
thought it was interesting that this is
specifically the place with where
they're putting these thousands of
burning of chambers burning solid fuels
on the Tibetan Plateau doesn't sound
healthy now I have actually been to
Tibet I went to Lhasa and I'm not gonna
get into the China Tibet thing right now
but maybe the people in Tibet might be
like hey maybe you don't want to put all
these burning containers all over our
Tibetan Plateau move I don't know
but honestly if it's a pet and people
were to say that China would probably be
like we don't care we don't care what
you say I mean we were big China dick
around and China never exactly
I mean metaphorically yeah that's what I
was and also our Dalai Lama is the is
the right one and yours sucks now
there's more than I'm giving distracted
them okay so yearly monsoon in monsoon
seasons the monsoon winds from the
Indian Ocean sweeps north towards the
Himalayan mountains real-time data
collected from a network of 30 weather
satellites will ensure the burning of
fuel coincides with optimal conditions
for binding over the monsoon water mists
burning a burner network or the burner
network of all those burning containers
which cost $8,000 each by the way will
be assisted by a cloud seeding done by
drones planes and even artillery 500 of
those burning burning burning chambers
have currently been erected at a cost
again of 5/8 I'm sorry $8,000 each you
said around oh they are yes I did so
they've invested a decent amount of
money into this China has been known to
do some some weather manipulation
projects in the past including
surrounding them 2008 Olympic Games and
they've had some success with them so
it's not like this is some pipe dream
that they're gonna be like we're doing
all this stuff to effect the weather and
it's actually like you know people can't
actually do that it does work to some
extent and really tests according to the
article have been somewhat effective so
we'll see how it actually works now the
big larger questions apart from the
potential impact of the dependent people
I already mentioned or like does causing
more rain in this area cause less rain
in other areas
China's stated goal here is to combat
climate change which is an honorable
which is which is a noble goal and in my
view and China has to their credit been
taking many steps in
and the recent months in last couple
last few years to combat climate change
but this was just one of those projects
it's like wow that's pretty crazy and
possibly something to keep an eye on see
if it's successful see if it actually
causes much problems elsewhere sounds
like a good premise tolling like a like
a movie for some reason I'm reminded of
of tailspin
remember the old days I'm just
constantly reminding people that I'm old
remember meatspin tailspin from the
Disney Afternoon afternoon cartoon tales
Oh with like duck tales type yeah it was
in there with duck tales short he had
blue and kick cloud kick cloud kicker
and stuff like that but I feel like
there was a plot line yeah in tail spin
where they tried to do some weather
manipulation stuff it's pretty advanced
for a kids show it's a really cool show
blue head that has is he had his
amphibious plane you know he could land
on water and stuff like that and he was
a pilot and then kit was like this young
orphan but you know he was he was he was
sassy right yeah
got to be sassy and then he would go and
he had this airfoil thing which was like
a little it was like a it's like a
boomerang thing and he would he would
collapse down and he could it's this
thing doesn't exist in real life and he
was just like expand it and then he
would get like like he was right it like
he was skiing behind us behind a boat he
would get one he'd get a rope coming off
of the plane and he would ride that
airfoil like over the clouds and stuff
so his name is kit cloud kicker very
fortuitous that that was his name yeah
because he had ventually ended up doing
that which was so he was kicking the
clouds literally but he was surfing him
getting a little off off subject here I
want to find out more about this show
yes let's talk about one more thing here
on tech of the day after tomorrow okay
turn the fan back down again - I know
it's just warm again so quickly he took
his airfoil yes that was kids all these
computers lights all right uh energy
harvesting yams Kyle energy yeah misting
yams it'd be the hot new thing that
didn't make any sense
Marin's yarns yeah that's a real RN
carrying very distinct difference there
between yarns and yam but I am but I'm
looking forward to energy harvesting
yams - I've never had a yarn that will
be something in the future I would look
forward to alright so energy harvesting
yarns what's the potential here twister
on they have a cool name twister on
there's a transformer name twister on
yarns there would be a transformer name
twister on who would be built out of
these yeah and he would transport
children to move to a ball of yarn a
ball of yarn or like a big like a big a
cat with a ball of yarn he would just
shoot balls of yarn out of his butt this
is exciting because it is an actual
application for carbon nanotubes yay
which are whole cylinders of carbon that
are ten thousand times smaller and
dynamic diameter than a human hair but
small they take the nanotubes and they
twist spin them into high-strength
lightweight yams yarns lightweight
lightweight yarns I really want to eat
yams now as seen as seen here in this
picture the yarns are made highly
elastic by twisting them so they coil
like an over twisted rubber bands to
generate electricity the yarns must be
either submerged in or coated with an
ionic Li conducting material or
electrolyte and that could be something
as simple as like pour Gatorade on it
yeah like like salt water for example
but I'm imagining there's different
conducting materials that they're
testing they're fundamentally super
capacitors so when the carbon nanotube
nanotubes yarn is inserted into an
electrolyte bath the yarns are charged
by the electrolytic cells no external
battery or voltage is needed so
stretching the coiled twister on yarn
yarns 30 times a second in their tests
generated 250 watts per kilogram of peak
electrical power when normalized in to
the harvesters weight I don't know about
the harvesters weight and I'm not sure
they're talking about a person or what
they're but I'm sure that's when they
just you stretch them a lot like there
and movements stretching just twisting
generates an electrical church a twister
on yarn weighing less than a housefly
could power a small LED which lit up
each time the yarn was stretched hmm I
see so I'm imagining like like a cool
this is gonna be remember it
you remember hypercolor shirts no you're
dating yourself again aren't you
Barrett hypercolor shirts anyone happen
chat I'm a young millennial and I have
no idea what you're talking I don't even
I've never even heard that term before
ah geez what else can I say in one key
field Wow tie-dye like pictures look
like they're from the early nineties or
something like that hey every color
shirts where they were shirts it would
change color based on temperature ah so
it would look really cool because you
could roll shirts yeah thermal thermal
shirt is bubbling reactive shirts look
here's a picture of them being
demonstrated a Saved by the Bell so
there you go but yeah it was cool cuz
you could let you could like put your
hand on it and do like a handprint
because your hand is warm right and
whatever but it they it was a fad diet
out quickly because you realize like it
just changes color under your armpits
when you sweat point being though the
reason I bring this out in pink pepper
is that the next big fad like hyper
color which is obviously so popular that
you don't even know what the hell it is
is gonna be these shirts right and then
you move around in the shirt and it
powers up battery it powers up LEDs that
are on the shirt and and then the shirt
lights up I guess there are already
shirts like that that do that but they
require a battery source these are just
gonna be self powered which I'm excited
about so but I mean if it's based on
stretching and you like we're wearing
pants made of this material and like you
did the splits then really the only
thing that would light up is your crotch
and you'd be like sort of faced with the
hyper color pit-stained dilemma again
well I think I don't think it's like
there's only electricity generated in a
specific area like it like electricity
can be
homey distribute the material is this is
a super capacitors I see you could wire
the LEDs to like your yeah it could
collect the energy in one spot and
transmit it to a different area where it
would I'm exempt do work and light a
light up a light or something like that
and just do some morning stretches and
you'll have a very illuminated outfit
that's what I'm that's why I'm gonna
invest in this seems very practical so
researchers so that the twister on
harvesters into a shirt normal breathing
stretched the yarn and generate
generated an electrical signal so it's
like you won't even have to like move
much you just breathe
another use case they deployed this in
the sea in the ocean a ten centimeter
long yarn weighing 1 milligram or about
the weight of a mosquito was attached
between a balloon and a sinker that
rested on the seabed
so when waves arrived the balloon had
rise and stretched the yarn up to 25%
thereby generating measured electricity
so another potential practical use case
you get a bunch of this yarn throw it in
the ocean get electricity I mean you
could light it to do it so you do what
they do with the buoy and stuff like
that sure there you go all right I'm
sure that'll find its way into heaven
soon
yep okay that is pretty much all of the
they'll be useful relevant stuff I have
to talk about today cool so let's
quickly go over any of the people who
have made donations thank you guys for
donating and chat and starting with
Scott Dilbeck 6.66 cents years thanks
Scott and Roush wire five Canadians hey
guys if you missed my tweet that eBay
6600 K was a bust but now I have an
excuse to send it to the CPU graveyard
or have you to check if it's dead Andrew
and my experience of CPUs are dead
they're dead if you put it into a
motherboard and it's not starting up
then as long as you know the motherboard
works and the memory you're using works
it's probably the CPU yeah I would think
if you bought that from eBay that you
could like I mean was it sold as is can
you do you have any recompense you're
there like
go back and return it or something like
that yeah I'll do that it's not working
possible also check your BIOS update
sometimes your system won't boot or you
won't get any sort of video signal if
your BIOS isn't up-to-date just just
started out there alright next we have
something from I can't pronounce all in
Japanese characters that's Chinese so
Chinese sorry cuz it's five five Hong
Kong Hong Kong Hong Kong yinz so thank
you whoever sent that thank you for the
Hong Kong money you're probably from
Australia or something read 110
Australia's speak of the devil what's
the best GPU just what's the best GPS
cube not right now but in history based
on what it brought to the market
affordability how long it lasted for the
buyer or any metric history can judge
the GPU as best it's probably up for
debate
yeah and it also depends on the metrics
that you're looking at there yeah bang
for the buck overall performance
performance per watt or what longevity
in the market yeah just PS you know how
long was it how long was it supported
and if you know how hard is it the best
yeah how long was it supported by the
manufacturer and kept receiving updates
like you know right
I mean right now I'd say the best gaming
GPU is the 1080i yeah usually the 80 the
xx abt eyes or X atti cards tend to be
the top performers from Nvidia in the
last couple of years there's also like
dual GPUs that have come out years prior
we haven't seen one for a while but
those have been pretty beefy in terms of
just raw horsepower didn't get really
hot but again it really depends on what
kind of metrics you're looking at I
would I would just bring up all the
graphics cards that I've owned because I
like to think that must taste they made
all the hardware agents right yes the
horse as desired gtx 260 corset core
core 216 before my tests huge 770 900
gtx
yeah honestly that's a that's a very
very open question so it's hard to save
right now so for right now that's in a
UTI yeah it's been around for a it's
been around for a while 2016 true yeah
still hasn't been replaced a long reign
with that cod BV tchau tchau
leave me child with the $10 I haven't
seen you in her in a while
I haven't seen you in a minute DV just
while doing ret you know Richard two of
you know that I still rule and support
you guys please keep at the good work I
probably won't be able to catch Kyle
half so be nice and share power don't be
a dick don't be a dick DB says don't be
a dick Thank You TV
I will I'm sure he will abide by your
requests I'll be watching you closely
right next to me every 67 37 cents Paul
how's the tesla powerwall coming along
that's a good question I was working on
a video my next video in that ongoing
saga and intended to post that actually
intended to post that yesterday but
delays I intended to post it earlier
today but I don't like to post it like
right up against awesome hardware so I'm
waiting I'm going to post that tomorrow
so tomorrow probably mid morning there
will be an updated part to the Tesla
installation long story short they were
supposed to install the solar and they
decided that my roof needed to be
replaced first so there's more details
on that but because of that the solar
installation has been delayed but that
is scheduled for next week so yeah I do
have an update on it still not completed
but it's coming along thank you for your
question thank you for your donation
very exciting Robert F $10 says before
combat great story I was going to ask if
I would if I would get a worthwhile
boost in performance going from a 9370
with 16 gigs ddr3 ram and a Radeon 380
if I get a rise in 1600 X and 8 gigs
ddr4 memory
your speeds gonna matter a lot more than
your capacity I mean eight to 16 Mikey
will give you a some sort of boost but
it depends on your ddr4 speed too if
you're talking about Rison I'd say the
increase that you're looking at at the
9370 is a there's a piledriver one of
those right I believe so yeah it's one
of the I don't know I stopped paying
attention to AMD's CPU lunches before
rising before before Isaac well because
they came with a piledriver then
excavator and them whatever and they
were all just really slight derivations
of the earlier stuff and you had big
improvements in whatever and I just sort
of stopped carrying so right yes 1600 X
is a huge it's a big old jump from the
9370 or your bad series of CPUs so you
know I'd say it's worth it make sure you
get a motherboard that has four dimm
slots so your 8 gig kit that you're
buying right now I'm assuming you're
buying a 2 by 4 gig kit that you can
drop in to buy another 2 by 4 gig kit or
a 2 by a cake it in there because
because you will want more than 8 gigs
eventually but yeah I can understand
getting by with 8 for right now while
prices are high
JC MP technology services $10 Paul
please joined floatplanes so I can
unsubscribe from high and make better
use of company funds yes I write off the
subscription okay I do not approve of
this donation
I don't think Linus or Luke or any of
them watch the live show so they
probably but I am like I'm like two
weeks late on signing up for floatplane
they talk to I talk to Linus like the
I've got you and everything I have just
been completely distracted and doing
other things so yes I am planning and
intending to and probably very soon will
be joining floatplane so you guys will
be able to subscribe to me they're
probably fun cuz it's lonely right right
now for me there's no one else
well Ida said he was disappointed with
something about being disappointed with
this the current performance it was like
we really need to beef up the creator's
on floatplanes Bryce van der knit 10
Australia's hey guys ever Thermaltake p5
case with an ROG Strix ex 370 board is
there a way to mount the i/o shield that
you can think of as there is no way to
clip
in like a conventional case because
you're just like floating there I oh she
does the thermaltake p5 it's like you
know it's just like that wall right it's
just so would you need why would you
need the IO shield yeah I mean I've
shields really there it's just mean care
to block the air holes so that you can
have directional airflow right please -
sure case and since that case is
designed to really just be completely
open and not have the need for that type
of air flow I think your only choices
are somehow just like glue it on there
outside if you really wanna be there for
some reason though why would you need it
or that's what I'm curious about or
upgrade to one of these new motherboards
accessibility because the new hotness
now is the built-in and IO shield asus
did it a couple of their high-end boards
and now it's starting to trickle down
more and more to the lower end boards
gigabytes got enough on a couple of
their new x4 70 boards that I've seen so
again that's good luck thank you the
brace El Jefe review heavy $5.00 hey
guys Oh what up dude Paul how's that
Tesla power hey coming along Kyle the
smart speaker test with Gramps was
awesome cheers man
okay your question has already been
answered so thank you for your $5 it has
and thanks for watching this video stay
tuned to my channel tomorrow for that
video no one no one like it's this is
like the grandpa video that I posted
recently is like the lowest-performing
video based on views that I've posted in
like years
your grandpa video yes oh no it's like
it's terrible it has like 25,000 views
in the last you know 16 hours or
whatever but if you look alike - just
like ratio it's like 99.5% likes what
you saw looks like everyone loves the
video but no one is watching it which is
frustration people will just give it a
chance like yeah because more people
should see this that's because it
deviates you know pretty pretty pretty
heavily from like the typical PC
hardware content but doesn't mean it's a
bad video you guys check it out if you
haven't yet thanks so Jefe appreciate it
man clint Flippo 20 bucks
happy Thursday my dudes it's Tuesday but
we still appreciate all the money you're
giving you know
for 20 bucks you can you can make this
whatever day you want and we'll go along
with it happy freakin Thursday to you
Clint Thank You Man Frank these five
dollars how many watts or heat does a
120 millimeter AIO push-pull setup
dissipate I have an i7 8700 K max clock
ITX case Frank that's not vary based on
the a IO itself the thickness of the
radiator the quality and speed of the
fan you know the static pressure of the
fan the density of the radiator fins the
speed of the pump it's also gonna vary
based on your platform itself - since
Intel's
TDP ratings for the past couple
generations have been just kind of wonky
like 8700 K and its TDP which is what is
it like 95 watts or whatever the heck it
is yeah that's not I mean it's not 95
watts it's it's got a bunch of different
turbo states that go above that that's
that TDP and they use a completely
different method of calculation than AMD
does so it's difficult to give a direct
answer to that I guess his is what I'm
trying to say
but I will say liquid cooling is very
effective and very good at getting that
heat away from the CPU and
120-millimeter all in one should perform
if as long as it's a halfway decent one
should perform just as well as any
halfway decent 40 $50 air cooler I feel
like yeah it should be in that range I
would definitely go for one of the
thicker radiators yeah I think his
models cuz they have some really cheaper
like slim ones that just aren't as good
at cooling it as like the thicker
radiator so if you have space in your
Mini ITX case for a thicker add I would
definitely go that route and you know I
think that's more important honestly
than having push-pull if you can have a
thicker radiator and just ditch one of
the fans that's better than having a
thinner radiator with two fans I've
tested this it's all about the radiator
fin surface area yes in that case and
that's what you really lose a lot of
what that 120 compared to like a 240 or
or something like that
yeah but thank you for your donation
frankly we have
for you some advice Tanner wertham $5 is
hema dudes I just turned 21 and I can
finally enjoy beer with you guys what
beers do you guys recommend cheers man
21 is a beautiful age I wish I was 21
again I would say Tanner sees today and
don't you like live your life at 21 and
appreciate it but you're not gonna do
that because you can't you really yeah I
know it's impossible it's two
perspective that you gain it's all sick
you know once you're old like me guys
those are all the good old days I should
waste it times spent my days more wisely
anyway congratulations on being 21 yeah
wish you the best I would recommend
beers you I don't know where you're
located it can can be significant impact
because I mean certain areas have a lot
of like cool micro breweries and
personal tastes just beer taste is so
subjective do you like IPAs stouts you
know Browns Reds pilsners all right a
beer that you can get I think pretty
much anywhere now that I think is pretty
decent is Fat Tire yeah that's I think
it's distributed by anheuser-busch sure
one of the big ones now so mm-hmm
that's it I like like Fat Tire New
Belgium Brewing that's the beer that
that got me hooked on craft beer up
until my college I think sophomore no
freshman year of college I had only been
drinking like shit beer like Budweiser
Coors Light Mickey's and then someone
introduced me to Fat Tire and I was like
I didn't know beer could taste this way
and I started exploring and and being
more adventurous with my beer tasting
and it's where I am now as the beautiful
yeah on a sewer that I am and like for
me honestly like there's a transition
that you'll go through so like if you're
if you're not into craft beers and you
like drinking a Budweiser and stuff like
that then by all means drink that drink
the beer that you enjoy and you think
tastes good because we just won't talk I
know when I was 21 and me and my old
roommate Chad would go to buy beer we
didn't wonder about like what tastes the
best were like what is the lowest price
and the highest
alcohol percentage by volume right yeah
and if you're 21 let's populate actor
down the whole list and be like what's
on sale right yeah this is a 24 pack
this is a 32 pack there's only there's
way more drunk so much money that I call
it yeah that's that's yeah
arrogant bastard check out arrogant
bastard from Stone just got a 22 ounce
of that you'll be you'll be feeling
pretty good after one of those bottles
not too expensive either okay Aaron
Lawrence 10 bucks hey guys been a while
since I donated are you guys planning on
going to LTX I'm driving up from Iowa
and it would be awesome to see you guys
as well Aaron I would love to go to LTX
someday but this year is probably not
the year for me because it's just bad
timing there's a bunch of other stuff
other projects that I have on the agenda
but but maybe someday in fact I know if
LTX continues like for the next 10 years
I know for sure I'll probably be at one
of them at some point but probably not
this year if I'm being awesome but it
sounds like a lot of fun yeah pretty
much the same answer from me I think we
both got it we did get invited to LTX
yeah and I think we respectively
respectfully declined it is something
that we totally like going to but travel
is you know every time you go and travel
somewhere it's gonna take time away from
the regular production as well as the
day-to-day works that you just do being
at home and spending time with loved
ones and all that kind of stuff so yeah
not going this time but hopefully be
able to make it in the future because
that's one thing I would like to do a
little bit more of us go to events yeah
there's more fans at as opposed to stuff
like Computex and CES for sure which are
more industry things oh yeah but you're
really cool for that purpose but you
know you don't necessarily get to meet
as many people yep yeah you had a lot of
fun of packs yes absolutely and so many
people like came up to me and we're
saying hi I got to meet so many fans at
PAX weigh more than like you were saying
Computex or CES which is more for like
the press right being able to interact
with you guys was it made the experience
of the event in the weekend just a lot
more fun I think and very very rewarding
and stuff so maybe you guys will see a
setting LTX in the future what mate $5

to you pure love
Guido salducci $5 hey guys sorry I
missed last week's show but here's five
big ones great this live show on the
planet yeah thank you
that just give it up the stands yeah
Jesus I probably didn't to belch that
line right out of all the lines probably
at least been able to say that one
coherent ly so really without burping
away perhaps that's what makes it
beautiful it was a biting criticism of
the currents it was was just a state of
streaming social media platforms just
sort of here the bida tea and okay
there's the pure and honest I'm glad I'm
glad that your half is next and I don't
have to worry about ah chugs remaining
gaming $5.00 why does my Elgato as a hit
and what's that gelato el gato 4k 60fps
software tell me 1440p 144 Hertz is not
supported that's garbage
what the heck I don't know I don't know
that's on the software side of El Gato I
have not tried one of those cards yet I
know
gamers Nexus got one I think level one
Tech's got one that they were playing
around with a bit for Kasich so they
might have done some different testing
there yeah I do know that with my fork a
capture card from Blackmagic that's one
thing that I wanted to try pretty early
on was like it has the bandwidth
capacity because that's really what it
boils down to when you're talking about
different resolutions and screen refresh
rates resolutions and refresh rates is
yeah it's just that much more bandwidth
that that is needed but it's not just
the raw bandwidth it also needs to
support that frequency and and frame
yeah yeah resolution so I don't think
like my guess would be that the elgato
only goes up to 60 Hertz
and that that's the maximum it can
capture right but I'm not sure I dunno
and again this isn't testing the direct
hardware that you're using but in my
experience you can play a game on a
source monitor that's a higher refresh
rate hundred Hertz 144 Hertz and capture
it and still basically you'll be able to
see the higher refresh rate but the
capture will go that well yeah it'll
drill it down or I don't know how it how
it enterprise
to choose only frames that equal 60
frames per second but right I'm pretty
sure that works but yeah I do when I
first set out because I would like to
get a via cool upgrade for my streaming
system yeah and try noxus you did
another $5 donation and said see my
streaming PC build on Facebook Traxxas
gaming dot nine everyone go to Facebook
