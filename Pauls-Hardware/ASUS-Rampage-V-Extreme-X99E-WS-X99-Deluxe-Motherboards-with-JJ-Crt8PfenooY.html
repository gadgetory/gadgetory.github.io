Paul's hardware today's video is going
to be all about x99 specifically Asus
x99 motherboards and if you're not
familiar haswell-e has now launched it
is available there's new CPUs there's
new motherboards there's ddr4 memory and
there's also JJ who is graciously agreed
to speak to us and share all of his
knowledge about this so JJ thank you
thank you and thank you for guys for
checking out the content no no no no
really
not just the beginning of the video
standard like hey man thanks really like
I want to thank you because you share
your knowledge with everyone and I think
you have real passion for this so so I
really appreciate that and I want to
dive into this actually I need to give
you guys a warning first off this is
going to be the long video so if you
haven't already looked at the timecode
down there I don't know what it's going
to end up being but it's gonna be long
we're not gonna pull anybody living on
the edge here we're gonna keep talking
until the cameras stop working or until
our boys just stopped working one of the
others let's start by explaining where
this other motherboard just came from
but not all right so what's what's
available from Asus at least right at
launch you should get you guys should be
able to find the x99 deluxe available
that's the mainstream series beautiful
black and white motherboard design we
also have the x99 a yes which is going
to be the I guess entry-level if you
want to call it that and granted this is
enthusiast so everything here is going
to be a little bit more expensive than
the mainstream stuff but that's okay
you're paying for performance also the
next 99 WS the workstation right here
which looks glorious sexiest workstation
board I think I've ever seen and then of
course the r5 e rampage 5 extreme whoa
what happened okay more more more
Hardware just keeps appearing in front
of us oh all right so here's how I
wanted to start off JJ we have three new
Intel CPUs that are going to be
available right now let's tell people
some of the characteristics of those
okay and maybe some recommendations
since we're and then from there going to
go into segmentation of these boards
because let's talk about segmentation of
the CPUs first so we had the 5820k which
is going to be again the kind of entry
level so to speak correct still uh still
a pretty high in part feel 6 for 12
threads 15 Meg's of cache in 28 PCIe
lanes okay and that is the difference
there that the intel has decided to go
with a little bit less PCI connectivity
yet for the the kind of entry-level
enthusiast part there but it's still
fully overclockable but still fully
overclockable so that's nice it's a case
cue it's unlocked so um and still 28
lanes of PCI so so more than like any
z97 platform yeah than anything you get
with it with the mainstream platform
still so still very nice but that is the
one thing to watch out for is if you
really need that full 40 lanes that you
give it the other ones then it might be
a reason to step up to the next level
which is the 59 30 K correct which is
also six core also 12 threads this one
also has 15 Meg's of cash 15 Meg's of
cash right and then this one you're
going to get the full 40 lanes PCI
Express connectivity correct again 3d I
should point out and then of course if
you want the best of the best you got to
go for the X level the extreme edition
59 60 X and that was going to be quite
pricey but they do give you actually
compelling reason to maybe buy that one
this time around that's because it's 8 8
core 16 threads it's pretty beastly and
5 more Meg's of cash so you get 20 Meg's
of cash on that one so many Meg's of
cash it's it's obscene so I feel like
it's compared to last generation or at
least with Ivy bridge-e
where you looked at the the extreme
edition and then the the K part the 49
30k it was kind of like really the
extreme edition felt more like a like a
like a halo product than it did actually
but this time around I think I think
there's gonna be folks actually J here
also do we thank J yes we did we take J
but it was over there's no girl thing I
really enjoy the Maccabean it thanked me
in this video we didn't thing in this
video so we're here J's two cents a
studio filming room and and thank you J
for letting us film we thank you for his
gracious about a quick aside there how
do you welcome
alright so J is given some heavy
consideration to the to the extreme
edition one just for the for those extra
cores and for the extra benefit you'll
get there from from rendering and
everything because you said in your
testing you guys have worked with a lot
of these is actually a pretty
significant boost yeah I mean overall I
mean just one one of the big benefits
that we have here is that
Intel's done some really intelligent
things in the overall architectural
design and what's been put into the CPU
so you're getting IPC improvement
compared to the previous generation on
top of all the hardware based
specification improvements such as the
such as the number of cores as well as
the actual cash
so even architectural a clock - clock
performance you get those improvements
so overall I mean it's really truly an
enthusiast class platform and they've
really brought it to be able to really
say in every single way compared to the
current high-end mainstream based
performance category you're getting an
improvement in every single respect so
you don't ever feel like you're going to
get a lower performing product whether
it's going to be you in relation to
expansion whether it's going to be a
relation to bandwidth whether it's going
to be relation to frequency whatever
it's going to be this is truly the
highest and platform that's out there on
the market okay and then if you guys
have been following stuff about as well
and that launch that has well last year
and has will refresh this year that
might that CPU architecture is what's
used in haswell-e of course and a lot of
those features have carried over to this
new cloud so we have a fiber for example
we fully intrigue or integrated voltage
regulation correct so I'm what are some
of the elements of that when it comes to
specifically things like overclocking
you know the the fiber just like we
talked about in previous generations is
really an interesting design previously
you know motherboard vendors had to do a
lot of work in terms of the power
delivery control implementation to be
able to kind of effectively manage that
so you had a lot of options how on how
the board could engage with the
processor in terms of what definable
parameters can be controlled
now the fiber helps to kind of equalize
that to an extent in terms that all
motherboard vendors now kind of have a
parity position in that respect but
there's still a huge amount of work that
goes into the overall topology and other
aspects of the power delivery and once
it going to recap the fiber doesn't have
anything to do with power delivery on a
motherboard all it does is pretty much
just manage the control parameters and
the conversion process regulating the
voltage yeah so so it pretty much just
comes down to in terms of making sure
that voltage
I'd say parameters of adjustment are
more consistent across all board vendors
okay I would say it would be how it
leverages and how it benefits the
consumer but outside of that you know a
lot of this still ultimately comes down
to the quality of the tuning that goes
into the UEFI and the firmware and how
that works with the fiber and how it
works with the platform and Asus has
actually done a bit specifically to
certain hardware based designs and as
part of our total topology to even be
able to maximize what this what the CP
allows for this generation allow us to
do some really interesting things in
terms of scaling the cash ratio on the
DRAM
dividers so there's still actually a lot
left on the table in terms of helping us
to maximize performance okay but
definitely the fiber being part of this
overall just helps to give us a very
consistent degree of tuning but as we
talked about you know as a whole
overclocking things along lengths of
things along those lines you're still
having actually a fairly wide degree of
variability on the CPU overclocking you
still get a guaranteed kind of baseline
of most CPUs achieving at least about
four to about four point two gigahertz
range on the I'd say the worst case EP
use but that's still a significant
overclock compared to the base clock
speeds but as far as what the best case
EP is will be best K CPUs could be
anywhere between you know forty five to
as much as forty eight so when you
consider the effective range being
between about four to is four point
eight years that's a little pretty big
swing and and the the extreme addition
has a base clock of three gigahertz and
a boost clock of three point three so
that's that's over a gigahertz that
you're getting correct and overclocking
and as JJ has tested a lot of these CPUs
already that's at the low end so if you
get that next golden ship you might even
get beyond that now I'm so to draw a
quick comparison just to round out that
fiber discussion was the eighty seven
you guys showed a demo showing
overclocking was the eighty seven 4770k
your entire series of mainstream boards
and how you were able to achieve the
same levels of overclock all across the
entire line when you talk an injury
level all the way up to the top
yeah I'm is is that the same kind of
experience that you might have
hundred-percent we we design our boards
purpose-built from the perspective we
don't ever want you to buy a board under
the presumption that you need to buy the
higher-end board to be able to ensure
that you get a great degree of what
we're talking and associated reliability
and stability okay so whether you're
going to buy the - a whether you buy the
Pro which will also be coming out or you
buy the deluxe they all can reach you
know four point eight gigahertz if your
CPU had that capability now margin was
there you know if it's a four point six
capable CPU all of these are all equally
going to be able to offer four point six
gig or its stability DRAM is going to be
the same thing
CPU impacts the RAM overclocking to a
large degree because once again there's
margin within the memory controller but
the work that we've done on terms of
tuning the UEFI tuning the topology and
the layout that's all giving you great
ddr4 overclocking potential and
speaking to the fiber that you just
noted also that is impacted also by
board design because the fiber doesn't
handle power delivering control for the
DRAM so we still have to put on our
digital power management control for
actually the quad-channel
memory design implementation but all the
way around yes any board that you're
going to get you can have a great
overclocking Spokane so don't
necessarily buy the RFI of extreme
because you think it's going to
overclock your cpu better yes but
there's many many many other reasons to
do that we're gonna get into all that
right now but I will Cabot that there is
kind of a little bit of a design that
relates to overclocking and so how that
relates is keep in mind that the - a
right has a smaller heatsink assembly
yes right then which you might have on
the deluxe so of course the overall
thermal efficiency of the VRM is going
to be better on the deluxe so in terms
of the load that you might put on it
when overclocking this will give you
better thermal efficiency and better
overall you know thermal performance as
you load the vrm under high overclock
scenarios so if you're somebody that
kind of cares about that to a degree
this is still going to be great before
me and it's not going to stop you from
being able to overclock but as you get
to more aggressive aggressive levels and
you load it up is there a little bit of
difference in those regards yes okay and
there also would be improvements further
in terms of the power component rewrite
you know the ws and the ROG boards will
even have higher grade power delivery
systems than what's offered on the
deluxe so same thing overall will they
be able to run with better thermal
efficiency and better thermal core
characteristics and potentially even be
able to hold a little bit better loads
at higher frequencies yes okay but
overall you know from a realistic
perspective for what most users care
about in terms of their target
frequencies they're gonna have a
consistent experience there also will be
always a bit of a difference on our G
boards where we push it to the next
level in terms of the level of kind of
tweaking and tuning and granularity and
how you can define your overclock
because exotic cooling right there's a
lot of features not necessarily just
exotic cooling there are actually
specific tuning parameters that we put
into the UEFI sometimes even on a
hardware topology layout specifically is
tuned to give us certain tolerances that
we can push more in one direction than
we might do on any other board but that
might come in to users saying you know
most users are probably only going to
buy 2133 - probably 2400 memory some of
you guys might jump into maybe higher
grade kits like here we've got this
awesome Corsair
memory it's 2,800 this is 20 666 is a
really high performance base kids oh
yeah
but we've even done validation course
here for 3,000 and 3200 right now if you
get into that class
there's tweaking and tuning you might
want to be able to do and keep in mind
we've even seen DRAM where you can go
from like 21 33 to 3,000 on some dim
side so having fine tune characteristics
of how you can tweak in tune that is
also kind of another element that's
built into the DNA for an RG board and
then you were saying earlier for memory
that we're just looking at the beginning
right now as far as ddr4 is concerned
we're potentially going to see 4,000 and
upwards in the fall yeah it's not a
question of if you you will see it it's
just a question of what all right
perfect
so from there let us move into a
segmentation because when it comes to
Asus an ASUS motherboards you can't
necessarily just look at the price and
figure this is the expensive one that's
better and this is a less expensive one
that's maybe not as better Asus designs
boards specifically for use case
scenarios and specifically specifically
for segments of the market that you feel
will get the most benefit out of the
features that are inner sure so shall we
begin with mainstream well the
mainstream series is really that it's
actually trying to target the widest
range of our users you know when we
design the boards as you noted initially
we have you know rrg which is segmented
towards overclockers and tweakers and
tuners and gamers and then ws for
content creation professionals or
general people that are going to be
doing high productivity on their system
and then mainstream actually really
actually needs to be able to complement
both those type of users okay um and
maybe serve somebody that actually might
be doing a little bit of all of that on
their system we don't know so in that
respect but we want to try to do with
the mainstream series of motherboards is
be able to complement just about any
type of usage model so whether it comes
into the level of expansion that's going
to be supported whether it's going to be
in the storage configurations whether
it's going to be in the connectivity
that's going to be offered we want to
really be able to try to align that with
any type of user so that if they get the
board it's almost the best
representation of ACS in a lot of ways
we want you to be able to have an
outstanding level of reliability
stability features and functionality
they should all be there but as you
progress to maybe a more specific usage
model might there be a better choice for
you within the ws within a tough series
within an ro g-series board yes that's
an entire possibility but it really
comes down to what's going to be that
specific usage of what you're going to
first and foremost be doing on your
system almost maybe more than anything
else and if you're somebody that kind of
does a little bit of everything right or
maybe even just like the statics or
specific features that might be
exclusive to the mainstream series which
might complement it maybe a little bit
more of a kind of an automatic nature or
you know a little bit more streamlined
kind of lovely usability that's really
who we try to target with and even
that's going to come down to even the
usability of the the board design right
these are a TX based specification in
terms of the form factor worse with WS
said with ROG they actually take out a
little bit liquor a larger form factor
okay so well you know probably all these
platforms are still high in and you're
probably going to always mean a chassis
that could fit any one of these you know
it still complements that flexibility of
being able to try to find itself in more
situations and I like as you talked
about flexibility not only in the the
features that are integrated into the
board but purely from an aesthetic
standpoint I feel like these days
particularly folks who are building
their own system who are di wires and
who are building a system on this
platform since it's the enthusiast
platform it's very high-end are going to
be keen on aesthetics as well so yeah no
doubt that's one of the reasons why we
introduced white you know I like the
black and white aesthetic yeah I think
it's it looks awesome you know I think
our ID team did really great job on
taking a lot of the feedback that we
provided to them to have something that
had a fresh modern clean kind of vibe to
it but also complement a wide range of
the new types of colors that we're
seeing from PSU and from chassis vendors
but also equally confined it's a kind of
place and a wide range of systems it
really complements a really I think
great look and feel that's just going to
be awesome and it gives you just our
board range if you look at it color and
thematically a great amount of depth so
any type of color scheme that you have
planned for your system you can probably
integrate this and Jay has already
talked about like oh you could probably
remove these and do different colors
with them or that sort of thing
but black and white it's it's hard to
clash with that too much so very nice
there and then I like how you talk about
how this sort of a sort of a set of an
non-negotiables for Asus where these are
the features we know everyone's going to
want yes you're going to find those in
the mainstream series of boards for sure
as well some additional features that
you feel will fit pretty much everyone's
needs depending on who you are of course
and that's yeah that's a really
important point because
you know historically when you take a
look at board design that hasn't always
been a trend I mean for Asus now going
on multiple generations it has been for
us whether it's in UEFI whether it's in
fan control whether it's in advanced
connectivity options whether it's going
to be like USB 3 boost or USB baz flash
back even Intel NICs
things like that we're starting pretty
much just put on every single of kind of
the enthusiast class level boards
because we want those features to not be
a reason why you're going to jump from
one more to another board that should be
the expectation it should be the given
what should make the board different is
going to be specific points of usability
or functionality which align more
specifically with certain type of user
nice ok so let's move on to the actually
wait a quick question for you before we
move on to the workstation there's
another series of boards in the
mainstream or at least in the end our
normal combinati dizziest platform the
tough series which I've always been a
big fan of and and I'll let you guys
know I've already asked JJ this before
so I know the answer but is there going
to be a tough series x99 board JJ there
actually will be a tough board we're
still currently working on design and
development as you guys know we take the
board design really seriously and we
want to make sure that we have an
awesome board in terms of its features
and functionality and really this has
taken a huge amount of design work just
to put out all these guys but there will
be a tough coming to the market for you
guys that are always excited about what
we're doing under the toughened ice and
the qualities of the tough series I mean
if you aren't patient or if you're just
not a big fan of military color scheme I
guess the work station series of boards
share some I feel like some of the
characteristics of that just in that the
quality of the components you guys have
chosen in here really meant for a
long-term use and reliability and that's
that's where the workstation comes from
as well whether you're talking about a
workstation or server this board is
really designed for people who are
relying on the computer that they use
for their day-to-day work they want it
to be reliable they want it to never no
component on here to ever have a chance
of failing and they want to make sure
that of course has all the the power
that they need so um is that a fair
assessment of workstation I'd say it's
pretty close you know I mean there's a
couple of kind of Halo points right one
is going to be just a depth of expansion
flexibility WS boards are always going
to generally offer more connectivity in
terms of
what you can do on expanding upon the
board okay so that's the course evident
by the number of PCI Express there's a
lot of those so this this is more than
40 yeah JJ what because it because there
we have a course actually plx and
complementation on the site so 40 wasn't
enough you got a general you get you
guys got users that want to be able to
have not only GPUs may be high in rate
controller cards may be multiple HDMI
capture cards make me a lot of different
configurations ws also historically
always has dual NIC implementations for
maybe let's say connecting to your
internet okay for as well as being able
to connect to the internet right or
maybe you want failover support built
into it there's also generally can be
very advanced robust storage
configurations although all exclaiming
nine boards have a lot of storage
configurations available onto them and
then also validation is a very big part
of WS boards okay
they go through an even more stringent
process than our board our traditional
boards in terms of reliability and
validation testing especially for
complex devices we do special option run
validation for complex cards like high
end RAID controller cards Quadro and
tesla cards firegl fire pro all these
type of devices you know they can be
very expensive so if you buy let's say a
two hundred four hundred five hundred
thousand dollar adding card you want to
know that it works this is something
that a traditional user that builds a
productivity or gaming related system
it's probably not dropping those type
devices in so this is where like a key
area where the ws product differentiate
itself but at the same time could this
just make an awesome high-end gaming
system for sure easily easily I think I
think J was Jay has machinations on this
board let's just put it that way and
that was the first thing that my mind
went to when you talk about the PCI
Express connectivity is like a Quadra
with a stack of Tesla's in there
something like that I could be over you
know I mean we're doing videography
right now right I mean we actually get a
lot of users right now especially with
4k progressing into more accessible
price points you're seeing guys put in
just one GPU and they're doing like
three to four HDMI capture cards pulling
in for multiple camera sources and then
letting the system do all the active
tuning I can imagine now and like
premiere Vegas or these are linear
editing programs you have multi camera
angle adjustment abilities this is the
type of platform that's purpose-built
for that stuff and it gets really
excited beautiful alright I'm looking
forward to seeing what kind of high-end
workstations and of course since we do
video specifically for that really
really excited to see what type of stuff
folks are going to come out with there
anything any other last words in the
list I think that covers it but you know
we talked about video a lot but really I
think it content creation as a whole you
could be doing everything from 3d
modeling to audio editing and production
to video editing and production you
could also be in entirely different
houses you know we get actually people
to do analysis and research financial
work you know you can imagine guys that
are doing actually trading they're
writing sometimes four to six panels
you're doing high computation processing
there's a crazy amount of environments
and like you said at the end of the day
it's a board built for expansion
stability and reliability it's going to
get the job done so beautiful all right
so that's the workstation now this is
the rog series board this is the our 5e
or rampage v extreme and the rog series
has had such a magnificent run for for
quite some time now I feel like pretty
much anyone who's like your super
EXTREME overclocker super extreme gamer
anyone who wants to do exotic cooling
liquid Ellen - yep dry ice anything like
that I feel like the rog series has
really set the standard in that area for
a very long time and then the other
thing that we've discussed before with
ROG is I feel like you guys take more
risks with this board and that's not -
not risks as far as like anything that
could possibly affect stability but the
ideas they come up with drop into the
board that you don't see elsewhere
because they're they're unique they're
different yeah but we've seen that type
of innovation trickle down to the other
series of your 5% right you know we kind
of treat ROG all mosa in the same way
that you know Ferrari treats its Formula
One team right and taking a lot of
advanced technologies and how that might
try to find its way into the consumer
yeah a consumer high-end Ferrari
oh yeah but that's kind of the same
concept as we right we really try to
treat the ROG product design group with
a sense of saying push the envelope
think about things that might not be
possible or buck the trend even if
they're more expensive even if they're
more complex and put it onto the board
and it's a way that we've also used that
to leverage a lot of key technologies
that have found their way into the other
products over
I'm in a lot of ways if you're somebody
that supports RG you're helping to
support pushing the industry forward you
know the most advanced fan control
functionality that we now are offering
here really came from RG having way more
advanced fan controls than competitors I
did for a long period of time digital
power delivery and control way before
until even had a thought of doing the
fiber was being put first on the rampage
three extreme to be able to push in the
air of saying digital power delivering
control is the right direction of move
motherboards right they said you were
crazy well yeah well you had actually
even competitors right they still said
analog designs were better and then all
of a sudden they all started switching
digital and then you see now fiber is
built into all the CPUs now every class
digital yeah and you know and all these
little interesting ways whether it's in
the topology the layout the hardware
based accessory implementations all
those things we definitely do treat rog
is kind of an innovation platform to say
let's push the envelope and let's really
complement it towards the tweakers
tuners and gamers and you know I think
if you look at what the industry has
done in terms of also embracing gaming
motherboards that was really born from
the designs that we've done on ROG and
that's really what it is if you're
looking for a board that is about
tweaking tuning and really complementing
a gamer that's where the feature set is
going to lie could you entirely use this
board for financial work we actually do
you'd be surprised I get I get guys that
do financial analysis and do day trading
and do simulation and they buy it
because they know the RG boards are
built like tanks right and they want to
run it you know so at the end of they
marketing exists only inside of a
marketing department right you can build
with any one of these boards and any
which way that you choose but is there
going to be certain features and
functions that align more closely with
your your usage model yes so that's
where our G is if you'd like to push the
envelope you like to tweak you like to
tune you like the game that's where the
fixtures are going to be okay so just a
couple random questions just for me
looking at the board right now it looks
like you have a special socket on this
is that the what what's the deal with
the special socket why is it different
and what was the what was the reason
behind that
you know we've we've put a lot of
interesting design work and we're not
going to go into all the details as what
we've done in terms of some specialized
design implementations okay but we've
gone and made some special design
tations it really allow us to maximize
the overall total platform overclocking
capability especially for the cash ratio
and for DRAM capabilities and for
overall just being able to have our
total topology you know we've talked
about the apology a lot in the past tres
layout specialized DRAM layouts right to
be able to to give you guys the best
experience possible and actually ROG
doesn't just have this all x99s use
motherboards have these special design
implementations to allow us to get the
best experience possible from haswell-e
based processors so it's an exclusive
hardware based design that acs features
it allows us to push the performance
envelope but ROG does take it to the
next level you know it is it has to be a
10 layer PCB along with very specialized
topology and layout that's been tuned to
really push the envelopes of what the
platform has to offer excellent so not
going to give up any trade secrets from
Asus here but there's there's something
going on with the socket we'll figure it
out eventually I'm sure ok apart from
that for ROG not only everything that's
integrated onto the board itself of
course which spec lists are available if
you want to head over the Asus website
if you don't see every single item that
they've integrated onto this board it's
a very long list but not just the board
itself but accessories so we're
maintaining the ROG Swoopes I dropped a
little rubber cover there so we have the
the monitoring unit this has a special
name if I'm not mistaken right yeah so I
mean all ROG boards of course at
currently produced all have support for
what's referred to as the OC panel with
Osasuna as well as the ROG front base so
these really kind of complement once
again the tweakers tuners and gamers out
there you know you want live real-time
monitoring that's going to be available
to you if you want improved audio
experience when it comes to your
headphone and microphone the RG front
base gives that to you and complementing
the isolated sound design that we have
as part of the supreme effects 2014
design that's on the motherboard but you
know the OC panel isn't just something
that can serve the normal user in terms
of being able to put your five and a
quarter bay like we talked about in the
past you know it's got an extensive
level of really diehard Tweaker and
tuning controls you can do temperature
monitoring you can have the ability to
do
thermocouples attached to this for more
advanced monitoring on different points
whether it comes to benching or
different types of temperature
monitoring you know you got the VGA hot
wire technology to be able to over volt
in overclocked graphics cards even
higher
degrees there's tons and tons of stuff
in there but that's part of the kind of
the ROG DNA is that you know you can
even have more than what's just built
onto the motherboard by quickly
integrating these type of accessories
onto the board and if there's anybody
out there who's been using this with the
the Maximus series of yards and that's
fully compatible I'm looking forward to
it
with x99 it is of course available and
that this is is this a new unit if we
seen this another yeah so the front base
section was released uh this year okay
you know we made an ounce for it
actually at CES but it came out a little
while ago but it's fully compatible
right now with our entire range of ROG
products so across the board any current
new ROG board does fully support the ROG
front base excellent so apart from these
which I think are these are ROG
exclusive we have some other add-ons
here that you might couple with these
boards some of them come with and some
of them are sold separately if I'm not
mistaken
so I mean in terms of the segmentation
it you know it breaks apart kind of a
little bit you know as we get into kind
of more detail on the boards and we can
you know kind of scope that out but in
terms of what you see here there are
some generalized accessories that will
work across all boards so you don't have
to feel that because you jump in at one
segmentation you're limiting yourself so
the Thunderbolt 2 e^x module that we're
at have right here a lot of users from
the x79 chipset wish that they had
Thunderbolt oh yeah but now the great
thing is with x99 every single of the
x99 boards fully supports this so you
can go ahead and drop that in you've got
Thunderbolt 2 right off the bat so
you're good to go now we just need some
Asus discount Thunderbolt cables that's
coming soon I'm sure
all right so we got Thunderbolt
functionality said all these boards will
support right bouts of Thunderbolt
headers so you just need to buy that
add-on card we've got still we continue
support where we can also evolve the
application and the software for our NFC
Express breakout brock's so this is a
really awesome accessory that gives you
NFC support as well as two front USB 3
ports you can go ahead and plug into any
one of these boards and it allow to go
ahead and do some really cool levels of
functionality such as quickly login your
system auto launch multiple applications
stream audio from your devices you can
do all kinds of really cool stuff so
that's an awesome accessory you just
take your phone set it there a lot of
matically recognizing the optical stuff
this little guy right here
a very specialized module so I guess you
know beginning to get into some of the
design features of course on the boards
you know we've always been a big
supporter of fan control functionality
on our motherboards and for the
mainstream series specifically this is
an exclusive accessory it comes included
with the deluxe but is compatible for
both the dashing and the pro boards okay
but pretty much what this will allow you
to do is go ahead and have more headers
so the board's like the deluxe comes
with six fan headers this is an honor to
have nine fan headers now set in
addition to that they're fully support
our fan x-43 technology so that full fan
calibration you can do DC or PWM output
control it's got three additional
temperature input sources so that you
can go ahead and leverage those input
sources either on the internal headers
or you can drive them to the to the
actual headers that are on the card
itself I mean it's pretty crazy I mean
there's not any fan controller that you
can buy in the market that's going to
give you that level of control
externally and then when you tie that
into the fact that that can immediately
complement and be available to you
within the UEFI or in the operating
system when you tie it into the board it
means you have a total of nine fan
headers that are all fully controllable
and tunable and support calibration so
this isn't just like a glorified
splitter like it's still going to see
one fan and those four right it's going
to see each one individually correct and
then you also have temperature leads
built in there and of course direct
power to provide power and excellent so
if you need more fans then asus has you
covered and that's the words just for
users that look at it from the core
perspective because of course the board
supporting PWM output control it means
that you could also exponentially
increase fan connectivity on the board
even without that because all you need
to do is then just buy PWM splitter
cable pop it onto your fan header and
Afsaneh you could have three or four
more fans but just powered by the PSU
but controlled by the motherboard on the
headers that are on the board itself
okay and then this this is a LAN card a
riser PCI Express card which gives you
an additional m dot two by four slots
and you're saying this was actually not
a not a terribly difficult piece to to
add on a design but from from the way
I'm looking at it I'm already super
excited to see m dot 2 ports across all
these boards and I really love the
implementation as well you have support
for at least 20 to 42 up to 20 to 80 on
everything every verse every board will
support up to 20 to 80 all right
beautiful but this will allow you to add
another
than any city could also potentially
software raid yeah okay yeah we've done
some cool tests I mean it's crazy
bandwidth because of course you're just
using PCI Express so if you want to get
crazy throw to them together and throw a
software raid then you're good to go
just keep in mind software rates of
course aren't bootable so they work best
generally if you're using them as a
local local volume okay but you know
it's just just an added level of
flexibility that we've given to our
users in terms of being able to go ahead
and install the storage device the way
that they would like to now it's
obviously going to be very dependent on
what's SSD you have installed here but
any ballpark figures as far as
sequential reads and writes it totally
depends on on the device you know we've
seen some next-generation controllers
that we can't speak to much but
definitely a significantly faster than
pretty much any numbers that you've seen
right now short of jumping into stuff
like you know Ram caches or Ram disk all
right beautiful so if you like to shoot
4k video and like to edit multiple
streams something like that is what I
feel like an implication like that I did
wait you're into hi oh you're into
uncompressed video you're into high
bitrate audio you're into raw
photography this that's a great option
for you
one other thing I wanted to bring up
which is something I know you guys are
very proud of is the 5 way optimization
that was originally introduced with z97
series and motherboards of course we've
had four-way optimization before that
but bumped up to five way that's
available on the mainstream boards as
well as the workstation board if I'm not
mistaken now if you guys are interested
in a more hands-on demonstration of that
I will direct you over to the J's $0.02
YouTube channel he should have a video
up on that now if not now very shortly
Nia can guys see a little bit more of
how that actually works five-way
optimization is specific to the
mainstream series and the wo series for
ROG while it does feature 5 bi
optimization the overclocking portion is
executed through a feature that we call
CPU level up so that works off of three
presets in terms of target frequencies
as opposed to the dynamic real-time auto
overclocking options which are executed
on the main stream or the WSB okay and
then just one more quick note about the
auto overclocking there's a few new
functionalities that are built in there
so for instance you can set you can
actually set a specific voltage like is
that is it a voltage ceiling that you
can pretty much tell yeah so you know by
default we limit the actual voltage to
1.3 volts but you can go ahead and scale
that up
higher voltages so if you want to do you
know one point three to five one point
for assuming that you have cooling and
you're willing to take on that risk as
far as the amount of current that might
be pulled through your CPU you can do
that we also now have selectable ATX
instruction sets which allow you to have
significantly higher thermal loads and a
higher degree of stress testing to the
CPU it'll bring down the total ceiling
but allow you to conditionally make sure
that the stability of the overclock is
as far-reaching as possible for
applications when we were watching the
demo you did with J that actually had an
effect so with the AVX instruction sets
it didn't achieve as high of an
overclock but it's also testing ABS ATX
instruction sets which means that when
you use applications that do that which
which day does that's something you want
to test for as well for sure and you got
memory stress testing that's built into
there we have modifications to the
actual Auto tuning rules where we can
now start for pure stock value allowing
it to cover a widest range of CPUs to
make sure that it can overclock even
though I'd say the lowest overclocking
capable CPUs it's available to you and
we have new what's referred to se
tolerance options which allow the actual
auto overclocking to dynamically extend
the overclocking range for a lower court
count as opposed to on all court counts
so this allows you may be in a situation
to have 4.6 gigahertz on four cores and
then on let's say all course drops it
down to 4.3 so there's just a huge
degree it's really the most
comprehensive and complete all over
clocking utility which has ever been
released by us and definitely is far
more reaching in terms of what you can
do automatically and easily than any
other product that's really out there
nice I'm very excited J was actually
impressed enough that he recommended it
and J doesn't like automatic
overclocking stuff he prefers do it
we've had a lot of comforts I think over
time you know I'm I'm indictable
enthusiast and I think the fact is I
challenge any user day one if there are
manual clock er to come in and be able
to produce the results that we can
produce within 10 minutes by clicking a
button and having a B system specific so
it's it's a really impressive tool and I
think the granularity that we giving
actually complements the Tweaker in the
tuner and the manual guy because if you
know what you're doing you can go in and
tweak those things and all have it
dynamically a kirpan and even if you're
still a skeptic about this go ahead and
use it try it out and just use it as a
start as a starting off way and then go
we go ahead and do all your manual
tweaking that you want to do all on your
own but it'll give you if nothing else
it will give you a really good starting
off point for that but JJ has also
turned down the gauntlet that he thinks
it'll stand up to even it said I mean it
saves an amazing amount of time I'll
definitely I'll definitely give it that
that what we were able to get to in in
five to fifteen minutes of opportunity I
would be able to do it okay yeah JJ's
conferring on overclocking for a decade
I wouldn't be able to do it just
impossible so well and the big thing is
it does actually what you do as a normal
user it actually goes through
incrementally raises frequencies raises
voltages text temperatures and does this
all dynamically real-time without you
having to engage in it and then it gives
you a great report at the end of it how
many of us sometimes are saving
screenshots writing little things down
in our notepad so that we can go back
and check all this stuff it does all
that for you so like you said you can
use it as a baseline you can use it as a
tool but I do want to continue to stress
sometimes people they've never heard of
the option before and they're now just
starting to realize it this is not
software this is a pure interaction
layer on a firmware and hardware process
you could install the whole tuning
application remove it from the system
after it's done and it's still there the
reason why is because it's been coded
into the UEFI so this is actually
literally just an automatic process of
taking literally the thousands of hours
that we've worked on this platform since
we started research and development and
production on it and just put it into a
single and easy to execute program I
think the one thing that you guys might
still need to integrate there is for it
to throw a temper tantrum when you're 59
60 X can only hit four point six and not
four point seven on air I will make sure
they discuss that with our seven phases
engineers to take another look at
alright this has been a very long video
so thank you guys for sticking with us
and I'm at jj1
one last chance any last I mean I know
there's more things there's always more
things but any last any final things to
mention here for you know yeah I mean
those are stuff like you said a lot you
know we continue to integrate our full
isolated audio design on every single
news board so for you guys to care about
you know music movies and games every
single one of these boards feature full
isolated audio design implementations of
course some of the boards a little bit
different than others where you know ROG
has some more options for you know
virtual surround and you know there's
specialized profiling options there it's
a little bit more complementary to you
know in-ear
monitors over your headphones or desktop
speakers on the mainstream series but
all the board's have that outside of
that all the boards are featuring all
Intel NYX which is a course a big plus
they all have a packet priority software
- that allows you to go ahead and
optimize in tune for gaming downloading
browsing whatever you're going to be
doing and compared to the fixed Nick
solutions like something like a killer
Nick we can map our packet priority
software to any port so the advantages
take for instance the deluxe and the
extreme these both actually come though
the world's first boards that feature
full 3x3 a to the live in AC wireless
built on boys so that is extremely fast
it's actually the fastest form of
desktop Wireless that you can currently
get in the marketplace it's built onto
the motherboard and we can also still do
packet in priority control to those
Wireless clients if you decided to buy
an add-in card for some premium maybe
you get our PCIe AC 68 or in a 4x4
client maybe that we release at a later
date you can do that you can map it to
any one of those ports with a killer NIC
it's only going to prioritize that one
single network connection and when you
talk about the Intel NIC - its
performance on UDP is unmatched which is
really where games live is in the UDP
environment and the management control
set is awesome so there's a lot more you
know we've covered a different things in
the past in terms of the UEFI
enhancements UAF is absolutely awesome
on here a lot of really cool stuff but
you know like always we've put in a huge
amount of design and work and I think
that if you guys look at the individual
features and functions across here value
I think is something that always comes
into play when somebody buys a board
regardless of maybe $200 $300 or $400 we
try to look at the perspective that
regardless of the price that you pay we
want to try to give you the most
complete experience regardless of the
price point so that you really walk away
with a sense of it you have a great
degree of value excellent alright and if
you want to see more of JJ if this
hasn't been enough go ahead and check
out the Asus PC DIY YouTube channel you
can see more from over there also the PC
DIY website which is yeah it's a PC DIY
Swisscom it's a great way if you guys
have any questions comments or feedback
you know one of the things I think that
we're most happy about and I think Paul
can definitely adhere to this is that we
take feedback to earnest I don't think
anybody else is coming
literally chipset to chipset and putting
in the work that we're putting in the
board so if you guys have it feel free
to drop in my way I heartily agree and
thank you guys so much for sticking with
us watching this video don't forget to
leave us some feedback down in the
comment section below don't forget to
hit the like button on your way out and
we will see you all very very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
