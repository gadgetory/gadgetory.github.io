tech day event and I have a bunch of
exciting news I have some confirmation
of specs and I have the announcement of
a couple new products that will be
available very soon we have an 8 core 16
thread arisin thread worker 1,900 X CPU
for five hundred and forty nine dollars
and we have the Radeon rx Vega at fifty
six a lower end Vega card for 399 since
we already have a confirmed launch date
for the thread Ripper stuff on August
10th CPUs and X 399 motherboards will be
available for sale I'm going to start
there and then we'll come back to the
Vega news so if you're not familiar with
this stuff at all thread Ripper is the
name of the new CPUs that are made for
AMD's new high-end desktop platform they
use a new huge socket tr4 and the cpus
are LGA so the pins are on the
motherboard side and this is AMD's first
ever high-end desktop platform which has
a lot of people excited because in
fellow hasn't had much competition up
there in that range like ever
really so AMD themselves pointed out
some pretty significant price drops with
Intel's 8 and 10 core consumer CPUs in
this generation and until they've priced
their processors for this way after Andy
had simply announced the existence of
thread Ripper so it's already doing good
in the marketplace now high-end desktops
are made for multitasking and heavily
multi-threaded workloads so Andy's
stated goal here is maximum compute
performance the largest possible memory
footprint as much I owe and storage as
they can provide for connections and the
support for multiple GPUs and PCIe lanes
64 PCIe lanes to be specific and you get
all 64 lanes with all the thread Ripper
CPUs so that's pretty cool threader for
motherboards are coming from Asus
gigabyte MSI and asrock at least and
they sport that huge tr4 socket and the
new X 399 chipset we got to check out
the thread Ripper packaging which does
look pretty cool and comes with a couple
extras including an ace tech cooling
bracket that you can use with a wide
variety of existing a spec CPU a i/o
coolers and it comes with a tool kit
with a Torx wrench since you do need a
Torx wrench in order to install CPU in
the tr4 socket a slightly different
means which I'm sure I will cover very
soon and yes AMD confirms that despite
the large size of thread Ripper CPUs
existing ace tech all-in-one liquid
coolers do cover the four
under the heat spreader so they should
work just fine doctor PCP use do have
180 watts EDP so at launch expect to see
about 20 different compatible liquid
coolers available from Arctic Corsair ek
NZXT EVGA enter max thermal taken prior
rig and we're also expecting there to be
at least five air coolers available at
launch designed specifically for thread
refer from Arctic Noctua and cooler
master shredder for CPUs themselves
includes 3 confirmed versions we have
the thread Ripper 1950 X at 999 dollars
at the top end 16 cores 32 threads 3.4
gigahertz base clock 4 gigahertz boost
clock 64 PCIe lanes quad channel ddr4
and of course unlocked for overclocking
next up we have the thread refer 1920 X
$799 12 cores and 24 threads
3.5 gigahertz base 4 gigahertz boost 64
PCIe lanes again quad channel ddr4
unlocked for overclocking and finally
the new thread Ripper 1900 X just
announced five hundred and forty nine
dollars eight cores and 16 threads so
just like an 1800 X for example but on
the high end thread grip of platform 3.8
gigahertz base clock and 4 gigahertz
boost clock 64 PCIe lanes again for
channel ddr4 and again of course unlocks
for overclocking so some pretty exciting
news I think to have an entry-level
thread Ripper processor that's going to
be up for grabs for people who want to
get in on that platform but not
necessarily spend 800 bucks
or $1000 on a sieve you just like the
mainstream rise in three five and seven
chips you still get XFR extended
frequency range but with thread Ripper
can actually boost up to 200 megahertz
over the theoretical peak clock so for
these that have 4.0 gigahertz
max clocks they should be actually able
to go up to 4.2 gigahertz as long as you
have adequate cooling of course now AMD
did set up a couple demos for us and
these are provided by Andy some grain of
salt of course but they seem to be on
the up-and-up for the most part first
off they showed Cinebench and actually
showed a rendering equivalent comparing
the 1950 X to the 7900 X and they were
like equal and then they were like why
is it equal supposed to be 20% faster it
was because they were running day-use x
at 4k 60fps in the background on the
threader per system so they reran that
sets again and then a 1950 x1 by about
20% which is pretty nice Andy showed
several other slides with
formants numbers comparing thread ripper
models to skylake x variants it does
look good from these numbers but as
usual I will recommend waiting until
independent reviews are posted on August
10th
now as for efficiency according to AMD
the 1950 X uses about 3% less power than
these 7900 x from intel resulting in 26%
more performance per watt availability
of these cpus is coming soon 16 core and
12 core variants will be available on
August 10th and then that 8 core 1900 X
will be available at the end of August
on the 31st pre-orders for those CPUs
though aren't going up tomorrow on July
31st so if you're really into it I don't
usually recommend pre-orders but you can
get your free and if you're interested
so the upshot of all of this is that we
now have a more entry-level thread
reproduction for 550 bucks we have some
very exciting performance numbers that
the tech community of course will be
confirming very soon and overall we have
what's looking like a very strong answer
to intel's lengthy rule atop the
high-end desktop market let's move on to
video though I have pricing as some
package deal options that might help get
these graphics cards into the hands of
gamers rather than cryptocurrency miners
I have lots of pictures and video of
course now the full story of Vega as
told by Andy goes well beyond gaming and
while I don't have time to go into all
that detail today I will say that the
Radeon Technology Group has been
designing this GPU to handle all manners
of GPU compute tasks to have native
software support for DirectX slow and
Vulcan and to continue to embrace the
flexibility of OpenCL when it comes to
developments Andy also continues to
point out the free sync monitors are
significantly less expensive than g-sync
counterparts so getting a complete set
up going for a gaming enthusiast can be
much more affordable with this type of
solution now if you're thinking AMD
should just skip all this Vega
workstation stuff and free sinks plugs
and just tell you if Vegas faster than a
GTX 1080 already well you wouldn't
necessarily be entirely out of line Andy
did show some of their performance
numbers for Vega which was also framed
in the context of achieving a good frame
rate for free sync gameplay but I don't
think they were trying to mislead here
they told us pretty clearly that what
they expect the Vegas 64 to do is trade
blows with the GTX 1080
might win some might lose some but they
also said that they can provide a better
gaming experience due to the better
sustained minimum frame rates and if
this is confirmed by independent
reviewers it
something that you should take a hard
look at it's not just average frame
rates that matter after all in a gaming
experience so Vega isn't going to be a
1080 TI killer but AMD has priced it to
give the 1080 a run for its money
here are the confirmed GPUs in the Vega
lineup the Radeon rx Vega 56 is the
newly announced version and it will sell
for $399 sports 56 compute units 3584
stream processors at 1150 six megahertz
base clock and 1471 megahertz boost it
also has eight gigabytes of HP m2 memory
with 410 gigabytes per second of
available bandwidth to attend 10 watt
rated board power and 10.5 teraflops
that p32 single precision raw compute
powered this card has a cooler design
that's aesthetically similar to the
Radeon fury or the rx 580 with a black
and red design and a plastic shroud
next is the Radeon rx Vega 64 and the
standard model with an air cooler
similar to the Vegas 56 will go for $499
there's also a special edition of the RX
Vega 64 that we had more time with and
that appears to be an aluminum shroud
which will only initially be available
through the Radeon PAC deals that I'm
going to be talking about in just a
second the Vega 64 though comes in both
air cooled and liquid cooled varieties
and some early pricing and so leak
through new egg listings seem to
indicate that at least do go up for
individual sale it will cost you an
extra 50 bucks for the special edition
and extra $100 for the liquid-cooled
special edition so the special edition
liquid cooled Vega 64 would be possibly
$600 that's not confirmed though but
again it looks like when these cards do
launch sometime in August only the
standard versions at 400 bucks and 500
bucks will be available for sale
directly the Vega 64 has 64 compute
units 4096 stream processors a 1247
megahertz base clock and 1546 megahertz
boost it also has 8 gigs of HBM to
memory but the bandwidth has been
increased to 4 and 84 gigabytes per
second it has a 295 watt rated board
power and 12.6 6 teraflops of single
precision raw compute power finally the
liquid cooled Vega 64 has all those same
specs as the air-cooled version but the
basin boosts clocks are different 1406
base 1677
boost and 13.7 teraflops of performance
and 345 watt
wordpower so let's deal with that Radeon
pack I've been mentioning so basically
AMD recognizes that gamers are going to
be disappointed if all of these Vega
cards are just bought up by
cryptocurrency miners at launch so they
made a deal that's better for you the
gamer but probably not quite as
appealing to miners if you buy a Vega
GPU as part of a Radeon tech and they're
available as the red pack for $4.99 with
a Vega 56 the black pack for $5.99 with
the Vega 64 or the liquid pack for $6.99
with a Vega 64 liquid-cooled you will
also be able to check out with a $200
discount on a free sync monitor and a
$100 discount on a rise in CPU and
motherboard combo and you also get two
free games one hundred and twenty dollar
value in the u.s. you're going to get
Wolfenstein 2 the new Colossus and pray
that the games will vary by region so if
you're outside the US check with your
local retailer I suppose these combos
are going to be much less appealing to
cryptocurrency miners because they
usually want minimal hardware investment
but bear in mind that you must buy all
of these products together at the same
time you can't save your discounts on
the monitor and the system for later if
you are in the market for a new system
and a monitor this is actually a really
nice deal for $100 more than the base
price of the card you get two free games
and 300 bucks and discounts of course if
you already have a system and a monitor
it doesn't really do much for you but at
launch the black and aqua packs will
include the Vegas 64 limited edition the
cool look and silver one and once they
run out of those and we haven't been
told how many of those are available so
that's a mystery they will switch and
just start sending out the standard
version with those pecs now that is all
I have for today as far as information
goes but it was a lot of it so thanks
for sticking with me through it of
course you should like the video if you
did enjoy it
and you can leave some comments in the
comment section if you're excited to
finally finally getting getting over the
hump of like Vega might actually launch
really soon and of course the Red River
coming on August 10th
I should be reviewing that and I might
also have a cool video for you in the
meantime maybe a little bit sooner than
August 10 so definitely subscribe if
you're interested in that thank you so
much again for watching guys and we'll
see you next s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
